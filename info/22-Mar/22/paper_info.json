    "abstract": "Face clustering is an essential task in computer vision due to the explosion\nof related applications such as augmented reality or photo album management.\nThe main challenge of this task lies in the imperfectness of similarities among\nimage feature representations. Given an existing feature extraction model, it\nis still an unresolved problem that how can the inherent characteristics of\nsimilarities of unlabelled images be leveraged to improve the clustering\nperformance. Motivated by answering the question, we develop an effective\nunsupervised method, named as FaceMap, by formulating face clustering as a\nprocess of non-overlapping community detection, and minimizing the entropy of\ninformation flows on a network of images. The entropy is denoted by the map\nequation and its minimum represents the least description of paths among images\nin expectation. Inspired by observations on the ranked transition probabilities\nin the affinity graph constructed from facial images, we develop an outlier\ndetection strategy to adaptively adjust transition probabilities among images.\nExperiments with ablation studies demonstrate that FaceMap significantly\noutperforms existing methods and achieves new state-of-the-arts on three\npopular large-scale datasets for face clustering, e.g., an absolute improvement\nof more than $10\\%$ and $4\\%$ comparing with prior unsupervised and supervised\nmethods respectively in terms of average of Pairwise F-score.

    "abstract": "Modern neuroimaging techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), enable us to model the human\nbrain as a brain network or connectome. Capturing brain networks' structural\ninformation and hierarchical patterns is essential for understanding brain\nfunctions and disease states. Recently, the promising network representation\nlearning capability of graph neural networks (GNNs) has prompted many GNN-based\nmethods for brain network analysis to be proposed. Specifically, these methods\napply feature aggregation and global pooling to convert brain network instances\ninto meaningful low-dimensional representations used for downstream brain\nnetwork analysis tasks. However, existing GNN-based methods often neglect that\nbrain networks of different subjects may require various aggregation iterations\nand use GNN with a fixed number of layers to learn all brain networks.\nTherefore, how to fully release the potential of GNNs to promote brain network\nanalysis is still non-trivial. To solve this problem, we propose a novel brain\nnetwork representation framework, namely BN-GNN, which searches for the optimal\nGNN architecture for each brain network. Concretely, BN-GNN employs deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) to train a meta-policy to automatically determine\nthe optimal number of feature aggregations (reflected in the number of GNN\nlayers) required for a given brain network. Extensive experiments on eight\nreal-world brain network datasets demonstrate that our proposed BN-GNN improves\nthe performance of traditional GNNs on different brain network analysis tasks.",

    "abstract": "For a very broad range of problems, recommendation algorithms have been\nincreasingly used over the past decade. In most of these algorithms, the\npredictions are built upon user-item affinity scores which are obtained from\nhigh-dimensional embeddings of items and users. In more complex scenarios, with\ngeometrical or capacity constraints, prediction based on embeddings may not be\nsufficient and some additional features should be considered in the design of\nthe algorithm. In this work, we study the recommendation problem in the setting\nwhere affinities between users and items are based both on their embeddings in\na latent space and on their geographical distance in their underlying euclidean\nspace (e.g., $\\mathbb{R}^2$), together with item capacity constraints. This\nframework is motivated by some real-world applications, for instance in\nhealthcare: the task is to recommend hospitals to patients based on their\nlocation, pathology, and hospital capacities. In these applications, there is\nsomewhat of an asymmetry between users and items: items are viewed as static\npoints, their embeddings, capacities and locations constraining the allocation.\nUpon the observation of an optimal allocation, user embeddings, items\ncapacities, and their positions in their underlying euclidean space, our aim is\nto recover item embeddings in the latent space; doing so, we are then able to\nuse this estimate e.g. in order to predict future allocations. We propose an\nalgorithm (SiMCa) based on matrix factorization enhanced with optimal transport\nsteps to model user-item affinities and learn item embeddings from observed\ndata. We then illustrate and discuss the results of such an approach for\nhospital recommendation on synthetic data.",

In this work,\nwe seek to understand the relationship between perturbed lip motion and\nsubjective opinion of lip motion quality.

We then train a model\nusing the scores collected from our user-study to automatically predict the\nsubjective quality of an animated sequence. Our results show that (1) users\nscore lip motions with slight over-articulation the highest in terms of\nperceptual quality; (2) under-articulation had a more detrimental effect on\nperceived quality of lip motion compared to the effect of over-articulation;\nand (3) we can automatically estimate the subjective perceptual score for a\ngiven lip motion sequences with low error rates.",

    "abstract": "Wireless millimeter-scale origami robots that can locomote in narrow spaces\nand morph their shapes have recently been explored with great potential for\nbiomedical applications. Existing millimeter-scale origami devices usually\nrequire separate geometrical components for locomotion and functions, which\nincreases the complexity of the robotic systems and their operation upon\nlimited locomotion modes. Additionally, none of them can achieve both on-ground\nand in-water locomotion. Here we report a magnetically actuated amphibious\norigami millirobot that integrates capabilities of spinning-enabled multimodal\nlocomotion, controlled delivery of liquid medicine, and cargo transportation\nwith wireless operation. This millirobot takes full advantage of the\ngeometrical features and folding/unfolding capability of Kresling origami, a\ntriangulated hollow cylinder, to fulfill multifunction: its geometrical\nfeatures are exploited for generating omnidirectional locomotion in various\nworking environments, including on unstructured ground, in liquids, and at\nair-liquid interfaces through rolling, flipping, and spinning-induced\npropulsion; the folding/unfolding is utilized as a pumping mechanism for\nintegrated multifunctionality such as controlled delivery of liquid medicine;\nfurthermore, the spinning motion provides a sucking mechanism for targeted\nsolid cargo transportation. This origami millirobot breaks the conventional way\nof utilizing origami folding only for shape reconfiguration and integrates\nmultiple functions in one simple body.

Although this combination represents a more complex optimization task\nthan supervised neural network training, the same gradient-based optimizers are\ntypically employed to minimize the loss function. However, the integrated\nphysics solvers have a profound effect on the gradient flow as manipulating\nscales in magnitude and direction is an inherent property of many physical\nprocesses. Consequently, the gradient flow is often highly unbalanced and\ncreates an environment in which existing gradient-based optimizers perform\npoorly.

Our method is based on a half-inversion of the Jacobian and\ncombines principles of both classical network and physics optimizers to solve\nthe combined optimization task.

    "abstract": "Despite recent success, large neural models often generate factually\nincorrect text. Compounding this is the lack of a standard automatic evaluation\nfor factuality--it cannot be meaningfully improved if it cannot be measured.\nGrounded generation promises a path to solving both of these problems: models\ndraw on a reliable external document (grounding) for factual information,\nsimplifying the challenge of factuality. Measuring factuality is also\nsimplified--to factual consistency, testing whether the generation agrees with\nthe grounding, rather than all facts. Yet, without a standard automatic metric\nfor factual consistency, factually grounded generation remains an open problem.\nWe study this problem for content transfer, in which generations extend a\nprompt, using information from factual grounding. Particularly, this domain\nallows us to introduce the notion of factual ablation for automatically\nmeasuring factual consistency: this captures the intuition that the model\nshould be less likely to produce an output given a less relevant grounding\ndocument. In practice, we measure this by presenting a model with two grounding\ndocuments, and the model should prefer to use the more factually relevant one.\nWe contribute two evaluation sets to measure this.

    "title": "Learning Compressed Embeddings for On-Device Inference",
    "abstract": "In deep learning, embeddings are widely used to represent categorical\nentities such as words, apps, and movies. An embedding layer maps each entity\nto a unique vector, causing the layer's memory requirement to be proportional\nto the number of entities. In the recommendation domain, a given category can\nhave hundreds of thousands of entities, and its embedding layer can take\ngigabytes of memory. The scale of these networks makes them difficult to deploy\nin resource constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach for reducing the size of an embedding table while still mapping each\nentity to its own unique embedding. Rather than maintaining the full embedding\ntable, we construct each entity's embedding \"on the fly\" using two separate\nembedding tables. The first table employs hashing to force multiple entities to\nshare an embedding. The second table contains one trainable weight per entity,\nallowing the model to distinguish between entities sharing the same embedding.\nSince these two tables are trained jointly, the network is able to learn a\nunique embedding per entity, helping it maintain a discriminative capability\nsimilar to a model with an uncompressed embedding table. We call this approach\nMEmCom (Multi-Embedding Compression). We compare with state-of-the-art model\ncompression techniques for multiple problem classes including classification\nand ranking. On four popular recommender system datasets, MEmCom had a 4%\nrelative loss in nDCG while compressing the input embedding sizes of our\nrecommendation models by 16x, 4x, 12x, and 40x. MEmCom outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art techniques, which achieved 16%, 6%, 10%, and 8% relative loss\nin nDCG at the respective compression ratios. Additionally, MEmCom is able to\ncompress the RankNet ranking model by 32x on a dataset with millions of users'\ninteractions with games while incurring only a 1% relative loss in nDCG.",

    "abstract": "One of the key emerging roles of the YouTube platform is providing creators\nthe ability to generate revenue from their content and interactions. Alongside\ntools provided directly by the platform, such as revenue-sharing from\nadvertising, creators co-opt the platform to use a variety of off-platform\nmonetization opportunities. In this work, we focus on studying and\ncharacterizing these alternative monetization strategies. Leveraging a large\nlongitudinal YouTube dataset of popular creators, we develop a taxonomy of\nalternative monetization strategies and a simple methodology to automatically\ndetect their usage. We then proceed to characterize the adoption of these\nstrategies. First, we find that the use of external monetization is expansive\nand increasingly prevalent, used in 18% of all videos, with 61% of channels\nusing one such strategy at least once. Second, we show that the adoption of\nthese strategies varies substantially among channels of different kinds and\npopularity, and that channels that establish these alternative revenue streams\noften become more productive on the platform. Lastly, we investigate how\npotentially problematic channels -- those that produce Alt-lite, Alt-right, and\nManosphere content -- leverage alternative monetization strategies, finding\nthat they employ a more diverse set of such strategies significantly more often\nthan a carefully chosen comparison set of channels. This finding complicates\nYouTube's role as a gatekeeper, since the practice of excluding\npolicy-violating content from its native on-platform monetization may not be\neffective.

    "title": "Closing the Generalization Gap of Cross-silo Federated Medical Image  Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Cross-silo federated learning (FL) has attracted much attention in medical\nimaging analysis with deep learning in recent years as it can resolve the\ncritical issues of insufficient data, data privacy, and training efficiency.\nHowever, there can be a generalization gap between the model trained from FL\nand the one from centralized training. This important issue comes from the\nnon-iid data distribution of the local data in the participating clients and is\nwell-known as client drift. In this work, we propose a novel training framework\nFedSM to avoid the client drift issue and successfully close the generalization\ngap compared with the centralized training for medical image segmentation tasks\nfor the first time. We also propose a novel personalized FL objective\nformulation and a new method SoftPull to solve it in our proposed framework\nFedSM. We conduct rigorous theoretical analysis to guarantee its convergence\nfor optimizing the non-convex smooth objective function. Real-world medical\nimage segmentation experiments using deep FL validate the motivations and\neffectiveness of our proposed method.",

    "title": "Improving Heuristic-based Process Discovery Methods by Detecting Optimal  Dependency Graphs",
    "abstract": "Heuristic-based methods are among the most popular methods in the process\ndiscovery area. This category of methods is composed of two main steps: 1)\ndiscovering a dependency graph 2) determining the split/join patterns of the\ndependency graph. The current dependency graph discovery techniques of\nheuristic-based methods select the initial set of graph arcs according to\ndependency measures and then modify the set regarding some criteria. This can\nlead to selecting the non-optimal set of arcs. Also, the modifications can\nresult in modeling rare behaviors and, consequently, low precision and\nnon-simple process models. Thus, constructing dependency graphs through\nselecting the optimal set of arcs has a high potential for improving graphs\nquality. Hence, this paper proposes a new integer linear programming model that\ndetermines the optimal set of graph arcs regarding dependency measures.\nSimultaneously, the proposed method can eliminate some other issues that the\nexisting methods cannot handle completely; i.e., even in the presence of loops,\nit guarantees that all tasks are on a path from the initial to the final tasks.\nThis approach also allows utilizing domain knowledge by introducing appropriate\nconstraints, which can be a practical advantage in real-world problems. To\nassess the results, we modified two existing methods of evaluating process\nmodels to make them capable of measuring the quality of dependency graphs.\nAccording to assessments, the outputs of the proposed method are superior to\nthe outputs of the most prominent dependency graph discovery methods in terms\nof fitness, precision, and especially simplicity.",

    "abstract": "Traditional botnet attacks leverage large and distributed numbers of\ncompromised internet-connected devices to target and overwhelm other devices\nwith internet packets. With increasing consumer adoption of high-wattage\ninternet-facing \"smart devices\", a new \"power botnet\" attack emerges, where\nsuch devices are used to target and overwhelm power grid devices with unusual\nload demand. We introduce a variant of this attack, the power-botnet\nweardown-attack, which does not intend to cause blackouts or short-term acute\ninstability, but instead forces expensive mechanical components to activate\nmore frequently, necessitating costly replacements / repairs. Specifically, we\ntarget the on-load tap-changer (OLTC) transformer, which uses a mechanical\nswitch that responds to change in load demand. In our analysis and simulations,\nthese attacks can halve the lifespan of an OLTC, or in the most extreme cases,\nreduce it to $2.5\\%$ of its original lifespan. Notably, these power botnets are\ncomposed of devices not connected to the internal SCADA systems used to control\npower grids. This represents a new internet-based cyberattack that targets the\npower grid from the outside. To help the power system to mitigate these types\nof botnet attacks, we develop attack-localization strategies. We formulate the\nproblem as a supervised machine learning task to locate the source of power\nbotnet attacks. Within a simulated environment, we generate the training and\ntesting dataset to evaluate several machine learning algorithm based\nlocalization methods, including SVM, neural network and decision tree. We show\nthat decision-tree based classification successfully identifies power botnet\nattacks and locates compromised devices with at least $94\\%$ improvement of\naccuracy over a baseline \"most-frequent\" classifier.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of object discovery -- separating objects from\nthe background without manual labels. Existing approaches utilize appearance\ncues, such as color, texture, and location, to group pixels into object-like\nregions. However, by relying on appearance alone, these methods fail to\nseparate objects from the background in cluttered scenes. This is a fundamental\nlimitation since the definition of an object is inherently ambiguous and\ncontext-dependent. To resolve this ambiguity, we choose to focus on dynamic\nobjects -- entities that can move independently in the world. We then scale the\nrecent auto-encoder based frameworks for unsupervised object discovery from toy\nsynthetic images to complex real-world scenes. To this end, we simplify their\narchitecture, and augment the resulting model with a weak learning signal from\ngeneral motion segmentation algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that,\ndespite only capturing a small subset of the objects that move, this signal is\nenough to generalize to segment both moving and static instances of dynamic\nobjects. We show that our model scales to a newly collected, photo-realistic\nsynthetic dataset with street driving scenarios. Additionally, we leverage\nground truth segmentation and flow annotations in this dataset for thorough\nablation and evaluation. Finally, our experiments on the real-world KITTI\nbenchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms both heuristic-\nand learning-based methods by capitalizing on motion cues.",

    "title": "Optimizing Transmission Infrastructure Investments to Support Line  De-energization for Mitigating Wildfire Ignition Risk",
    "abstract": "Wildfires pose a growing risk to public safety in regions like the western\nUnited States, and, historically, electric power systems have ignited some of\nthe most destructive wildfires. To reduce wildfire ignition risks, power system\noperators preemptively de-energize high-risk power lines during extreme\nwildfire conditions as part of \"Public Safety Power Shutoff\" (PSPS) events.\nWhile capable of substantially reducing acute wildfire risks, PSPS events can\nalso result in significant amounts of load shedding as the partially\nde-energized system may not be able to supply all customer demands. We\ninvestigate the extent to which infrastructure investments can support system\noperations during PSPS events by enabling reduced load shedding and wildfire\nignition risk. We consider the installation of grid-scale batteries, solar PV,\nand line hardening or maintenance measures (e.g., undergrounding or increased\nvegetation management). Optimally selecting the locations, types, and sizes of\nthese infrastructure investments requires considering the line de-energizations\nassociated with PSPS events. Accordingly, this paper proposes a multi-period\noptimization formulation that locates and sizes infrastructure investments\nwhile simultaneously choosing line de-energizations to minimize wildfire\nignition risk and load shedding. The proposed formulation is evaluated using\ntwo geolocated test cases along with realistic infrastructure investment\nparameters and actual wildfire risk data from the US Geological Survey. We\nevaluate the performance of investment choices by simulating de-energization\ndecisions for the entire 2021 wildfire season with optimized infrastructure\nplacements. With investment decisions varying significantly for different test\ncases, budgets, and operator priorities, the numerical results demonstrate the\nproposed formulation's value in tailoring investment choices to different\nsettings.",

    "title": "Evaluation of April Tag and WhyCode Fiducial Systems for Autonomous  Precision Drone Landing with a Gimbal-Mounted Camera",
    "abstract": "Fiducial markers provide a computationally cheap way for drones to determine\ntheir location with respect to a landing pad and execute precision landings.\nHowever, most existing work in this field uses a fixed, downward facing camera\nthat does not leverage the common gimbal-mounted camera setup found on many\ndrones. Such rigid systems cannot easily track detected markers, and may lose\nsight of the markers in non-ideal conditions (e.g. wind gusts). This paper\nevaluates April Tag and WhyCode fiducial systems for drone landing with a\ngimbal-mounted, monocular camera, with the advantage that the drone system can\ntrack the marker over time. However, since the orientation of the camera\nchanges, we must know the orientation of the marker, which is unreliable in\nmonocular fiducial systems. Additionally, the system must be fast. We propose 2\nmethods for mitigating the orientation ambiguity of WhyCode, and 1 method for\nincreasing the runtime detection rate of April Tag. We evaluate our 3 systems\nagainst 2 default systems in terms of marker orientation ambiguity, and\ndetection rate. We test rates of marker detection in a ROS framework on a\nRaspberry Pi 4, and we rank the systems in terms of their performance. Our\nfirst WhyCode variant significantly reduces orientation ambiguity with an\ninsignificant reduction in detection rate. Our second WhyCode variant does not\nshow significantly different orientation ambiguity from the default WhyCode\nsystem, but does provide additional functionality in terms of multi-marker\nWhyCode bundle arrangements. Our April Tag variant does not show performance\nimprovements on a Raspberry Pi 4.",

    "abstract": "In known security reductions for the Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation,\ndecryption failures are handled via a reduction solving the rather unnatural\ntask of finding failing plaintexts given the private key, resulting in a Grover\nsearch bound. Moreover, they require an implicit rejection mechanism for\ninvalid ciphertexts to achieve a reasonable security bound in the QROM. We\npresent a reduction that has neither of these deficiencies: We introduce two\nsecurity games related to finding decryption failures, one capturing the\ncomputationally hard task of using the public key to find a decryption failure,\nand one capturing the statistically hard task of searching the random oracle\nfor key-independent failures like, e.g., large randomness. As a result, our\nsecurity bounds in the QROM are tighter than previous ones with respect to the\ngeneric random oracle search attacks: The attacker can only partially compute\nthe search predicate, namely for said key-independent failures. In addition,\nour entire reduction works for the explicit-reject variant of the\ntransformation and improves significantly over all of its known reductions.\nBesides being the more natural variant of the transformation, security of the\nexplicit reject mechanism is also relevant for side channel attack resilience\nof the implicit-rejection variant. Along the way, we prove several technical\nresults characterizing preimage extraction and certain search tasks in the QROM\nthat might be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Video compression plays a crucial role in enabling video streaming and\nclassification systems and maximizing the end-user quality of experience (QoE)\nat a given bandwidth budget. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic\nstudy for adversarial attacks on deep learning based video compression and\ndownstream classification systems. We propose an adaptive adversarial attack\nthat can manipulate the Rate-Distortion (R-D) relationship of a video\ncompression model to achieve two adversarial goals: (1) increasing the network\nbandwidth or (2) degrading the video quality for end-users. We further devise\nnovel objectives for targeted and untargeted attacks to a downstream video\nclassification service. Finally, we design an input-invariant perturbation that\nuniversally disrupts video compression and classification systems in real time.\nUnlike previously proposed attacks on video classification, our adversarial\nperturbations are the first to withstand compression. We empirically show the\nresilience of our attacks against various defenses, i.e., adversarial training,\nvideo denoising, and JPEG compression. Our extensive experimental results on\nvarious video datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks. Our video\nquality and bandwidth attacks deteriorate peak signal-to-noise ratio by up to\n5.4dB and the bit-rate by up to 2.4 times on the standard video compression\ndatasets while achieving over 90% attack success rate on a downstream\nclassifier.",

    "abstract": "Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) consists of two optimization loops: the\nouter loop learns a meta-initialization of model parameters that is shared\nacross tasks, and the inner loop task-specific adaptation step. A variant of\nMAML, Meta-SGD, uses the same two loop structure, but also learns the\nlearning-rate for the adaptation step. Little attention has been paid to how\nthe learned learning-rate of Meta-SGD affects feature reuse. In this paper, we\nstudy the effect that a learned learning-rate has on the per-task feature\nrepresentations in Meta-SGD. The learned learning-rate of Meta-SGD often\ncontains negative values. During the adaptation phase, these negative learning\nrates push features away from task-specific features and towards task-agnostic\nfeatures.\nWe performed several experiments on the Mini-Imagenet dataset. Two neural\nnetworks were trained, one with MAML, and one with Meta-SGD. The feature\nquality for both models was tested as follows: strip away the linear\nclassification layer, pass labeled and unlabeled samples through this encoder,\nclassify the unlabeled samples according to their nearest neighbor. This\nprocess was performed: 1) after training and using the meta-initialization\nparameters; 2) after adaptation, and validated on that task; and 3) after\nadaptation, and validated on a different task. The MAML trained model improved\non the task it was adapted to, but had worse performance on other tasks. The\nMeta-SGD trained model was the opposite; it had worse performance on the task\nit was adapted to, but improved on other tasks. This confirms the hypothesis\nthat Meta-SGD's negative learning rates cause the model to learn task-agnostic\nfeatures rather than simply adapt to task specific features.",

This technique\nis particularly important because it circumvents the increasing efforts by\nbrowsers to partition or block third-party storage, which was previously\nnecessary for most cross-website tracking. While previous work has studied\nspecific navigational tracking techniques (i.e. \"bounce tracking\"), our work is\nthe first effort to systematically study and measure the entire category of\nnavigational tracking techniques. We describe and measure the frequency of two\ndifferent navigational tracking techniques on the Web, and find that\nnavigational tracking is present on slightly more than ten percent of all\nnavigations that we made. Our contributions include identifying 214 domains\nbelonging to at least 104 organizations tracking users across sites through\nlink decoration techniques using direct or indirect navigation flows. We\nidentify a further 23 domains belonging to at least 16 organizations tracking\nusers through bounce tracking (i.e. bouncing users through unrelated third\nparties to generate user profiles). We also improve on prior techniques for\ndifferenting user identifiers from non-sensitive information, which is\nnecessary to detect one class of navigational tracking.

By changing\na memory device from pushdown stacks to access-controlled storage tapes, we\nintroduce a computational model of one-way deterministic depth-$k$ storage\nautomata ($k$-sda's) whose tape cells are freely modified during the first $k$\naccesses and then become blank forever.

We present a coordinated pose control of mobile\nmanipulation with the stationary bikebot. The challenges of the bikebot\nmanipulation include the limited steering balance capability of the unstable\nbikebot and kinematic redundancy of the manipulator. We first present the\nsteering balance model to analyze and explore the maximum steering capability\nto balance the stationary platform. A balancing equilibrium manifold is then\nproposed to describe the necessary condition to fulfill the simultaneous\nplatform balance and posture control of the end-effector. A coordinated\nplanning and control design is presented to determine the balance-prioritized\nposture control under kinematic and dynamic constraints. Extensive experiments\nare conducted to demonstrate the mechatronic design for autonomous plant\ninspection in agricultural applications. The results confirm the feasibility to\nuse the bikebot manipulation for a plant inspection with end-effector position\nand orientation errors about 5 mm and 0.3 degs, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Semantic 3D keypoints are category-level semantic consistent points on 3D\nobjects. Detecting 3D semantic keypoints is a foundation for a number of 3D\nvision tasks but remains challenging, due to the ambiguity of semantic\ninformation, especially when the objects are represented by unordered 3D point\nclouds. Existing unsupervised methods tend to generate category-level keypoints\nin implicit manners, making it difficult to extract high-level information,\nsuch as semantic labels and topology. From a novel mutual reconstruction\nperspective, we present an unsupervised method to generate consistent semantic\nkeypoints from point clouds explicitly. To achieve this, the proposed model\npredicts keypoints that not only reconstruct the object itself but also\nreconstruct other instances in the same category. To the best of our knowledge,\nthe proposed method is the first to mine 3D semantic consistent keypoints from\na mutual reconstruction view. Experiments under various evaluation metrics as\nwell as comparisons with the state-of-the-arts demonstrate the efficacy of our\nnew solution to mining semantic consistent keypoints with mutual\nreconstruction.",

However, due to\nshared spectrum resources, it is challenging to achieve a critical trade-off\nbetween these two integrated functionalities. To address this issue, we propose\nin this paper a new integrated \\emph{periodic} sensing and communication\nmechanism for the UAV-enable ISAC system. Specifically, the user achievable\nrate is maximized via jointly optimizing UAV trajectory, transmit precoder, and\nsensing start instant, subject to the sensing frequency and beam pattern gain\nconstraints. Despite that this problem is highly non-convex and involves an\ninfinite number of variables, we obtain the optimal transmit precoder and\nderive the optimal achievable rate in closed-form for any given UAV location to\nfacilitate the UAV trajectory design. Furthermore, we first prove the\nstructural symmetry between optimal solutions in different ISAC frames without\nlocation constraints and then propose a high-quality UAV trajectory and sensing\noptimization algorithm for the general location-constrained case. Simulation\nresults corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed design and also unveil a\nmore flexible trade-off in ISAC systems over benchmark schemes.",

The main\nchallenge to achieve the benefits of cell-free massive MIMO is to realize\nsignal processing in a scalable way. In this paper, we consider scalable\nfullpilot zero-forcing (FZF), partial FZF (PFZF), protective weak PFZF\n(PWPFZF), and local regularized ZF (LRZF) combining by exploiting channel\nstatistics. We derive closed-form expressions of the uplink SE for FZF, PFZF,\nand PWPFZF combining with large-scale fading decoding over independent Rayleigh\nfading channels, taking channel estimation errors and pilot contamination into\naccount. Moreover, we investigate the impact of the number of pilot sequences,\nantennas per AP, and APs on the performance. Numerical results show that LRZF\nprovides the highest SE. However, PWPFZF is preferable when the number of pilot\nsequences is large and the number of antennas per AP is small. The reason is\nthat PWPFZF has lower computational complexity and the SE expression can be\ncomputed in closed-form. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of PWPFZF\ncombining with fractional power control and the numerical results show that it\nimproves the performance of weak UEs and realizes uniformly good service for\nall UEs in a scalable fashion.",

    "abstract": "Human action recognition has recently become one of the popular research\ntopics in the computer vision community. Various 3D-CNN based methods have been\npresented to tackle both the spatial and temporal dimensions in the task of\nvideo action recognition with competitive results. However, these methods have\nsuffered some fundamental limitations such as lack of robustness and\ngeneralization, e.g., how does the temporal ordering of video frames affect the\nrecognition results? This work presents a novel end-to-end Transformer-based\nDirected Attention (DirecFormer) framework for robust action recognition. The\nmethod takes a simple but novel perspective of Transformer-based approach to\nunderstand the right order of sequence actions. Therefore, the contributions of\nthis work are three-fold. Firstly, we introduce the problem of ordered temporal\nlearning issues to the action recognition problem. Secondly, a new Directed\nAttention mechanism is introduced to understand and provide attentions to human\nactions in the right order. Thirdly, we introduce the conditional dependency in\naction sequence modeling that includes orders and classes. The proposed\napproach consistently achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results compared\nwith the recent action recognition methods, on three standard large-scale\nbenchmarks, i.e. Jester, Kinetics-400 and Something-Something-V2.",

    "abstract": "Let $\\mathcal{T}$ be a set of $n$ planar semi-algebraic regions in\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$ of constant complexity (e.g., triangles, disks), which we call\n\\emph{plates}. We wish to preprocess $\\mathcal{T}$ into a data structure so\nthat for a query object $\\gamma$, which is also a plate, we can quickly answer\nvarious intersection queries, such as detecting whether $\\gamma$ intersects any\nplate of $\\mathcal{T}$, reporting all the plates intersected by $\\gamma$, or\ncounting them. We also consider two simpler cases of this general setting: (i)\nthe input objects are plates and the query objects are constant-degree\nalgebraic arcs in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (arcs, for short), or (ii) the input objects\nare arcs and the query objects are plates in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Besides being\ninteresting in their own right, the data structures for these two special cases\nform the building blocks for handling the general case.\nBy combining the polynomial-partitioning technique with additional tools from\nreal algebraic geometry, we obtain a variety of results with different storage\nand query-time bounds, depending on the complexity of the input and query\nobjects. For example, if $\\mathcal{T}$ is a set of plates and the query objects\nare arcs, we obtain a data structure that uses $O^*(n^{4/3})$ storage (where\nthe $O^*(\\cdot)$ notation hides subpolynomial factors) and answers an\nintersection query in $O^*(n^{2/3})$ time. Alternatively, by increasing the\nstorage to $O^*(n^{3/2})$, the query time can be decreased to $O^*(n^{\\rho})$,\nwhere $\\rho = (2t-3)/3(t-1) < 2/3$ and $t \\ge 3$ is the number of parameters\nneeded to represent the query arcs.",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based architectures start to emerge in single image super\nresolution (SISR) and have achieved promising performance. Most existing Vision\nTransformers divide images into the same number of patches with a fixed size,\nwhich may not be optimal for restoring patches with different levels of texture\nrichness. This paper presents HIPA, a novel Transformer architecture that\nprogressively recovers the high resolution image using a hierarchical patch\npartition. Specifically, we build a cascaded model that processes an input\nimage in multiple stages, where we start with tokens with small patch sizes and\ngradually merge to the full resolution. Such a hierarchical patch mechanism not\nonly explicitly enables feature aggregation at multiple resolutions but also\nadaptively learns patch-aware features for different image regions, e.g., using\na smaller patch for areas with fine details and a larger patch for textureless\nregions. Meanwhile, a new attention-based position encoding scheme for\nTransformer is proposed to let the network focus on which tokens should be paid\nmore attention by assigning different weights to different tokens, which is the\nfirst time to our best knowledge. Furthermore, we also propose a new\nmulti-reception field attention module to enlarge the convolution reception\nfield from different branches. The experimental results on several public\ndatasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed HIPA over\nprevious methods quantitatively and qualitatively.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the NLP community has witnessed a rapid advancement in multilingual\nand cross-lingual transfer research where the supervision is transferred from\nhigh-resource languages (HRLs) to low-resource languages (LRLs). However, the\ncross-lingual transfer is not uniform across languages, particularly in the\nzero-shot setting. Towards this goal, one promising research direction is to\nlearn shareable structures across multiple tasks with limited annotated data.\nThe downstream multilingual applications may benefit from such a learning setup\nas most of the languages across the globe are low-resource and share some\nstructures with other languages. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmeta-learning framework (called Meta-X$_{NLG}$) to learn shareable structures\nfrom typologically diverse languages based on meta-learning and language\nclustering. This is a step towards uniform cross-lingual transfer for unseen\nlanguages. We first cluster the languages based on language representations and\nidentify the centroid language of each cluster. Then, a meta-learning algorithm\nis trained with all centroid languages and evaluated on the other languages in\nthe zero-shot setting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this modeling on two\nNLG tasks (Abstractive Text Summarization and Question Generation), 5 popular\ndatasets and 30 typologically diverse languages. Consistent improvements over\nstrong baselines demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. The\ncareful design of the model makes this end-to-end NLG setup less vulnerable to\nthe accidental translation problem, which is a prominent concern in zero-shot\ncross-lingual NLG tasks.",

In short,\nsimilarity-based attention utilizes the correlation between frames while\ncontent-based attention only considers each frame without being affected by\nothers. We identify which parts of the original dot product are related to two\ndifferent attention patterns and improve each part by simple modifications.

Currently,\nthese black-box models generate both the proof graph and intermediate\ninferences within the same model and thus may be unfaithful. In this work, we\nframe the deductive logical reasoning task by defining three modular\ncomponents: rule selection, fact selection, and knowledge composition. The rule\nand fact selection steps select the candidate rule and facts to be used and\nthen the knowledge composition combines them to generate new inferences. This\nensures model faithfulness by assured causal relation from the proof step to\nthe inference reasoning. To test our framework, we propose FaiRR (Faithful and\nRobust Reasoner) where the above three components are independently modeled by\ntransformers.

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation with limited annotations, such as weakly supervised\nsemantic segmentation (WSSS) and semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS),\nis a challenging task that has attracted much attention recently. Most leading\nWSSS methods employ a sophisticated multi-stage training strategy to estimate\npseudo-labels as precise as possible, but they suffer from high model\ncomplexity. In contrast, there exists another research line that trains a\nsingle network with image-level labels in one training cycle. However, such a\nsingle-stage strategy often performs poorly because of the compounding effect\ncaused by inaccurate pseudo-label estimation. To address this issue, this paper\npresents a Self-supervised Low-Rank Network (SLRNet) for single-stage WSSS and\nSSSS. The SLRNet uses cross-view self-supervision, that is, it simultaneously\npredicts several complementary attentive LR representations from different\nviews of an image to learn precise pseudo-labels. Specifically, we reformulate\nthe LR representation learning as a collective matrix factorization problem and\noptimize it jointly with the network learning in an end-to-end manner. The\nresulting LR representation deprecates noisy information while capturing stable\nsemantics across different views, making it robust to the input variations,\nthereby reducing overfitting to self-supervision errors. The SLRNet can provide\na unified single-stage framework for various label-efficient semantic\nsegmentation settings: 1) WSSS with image-level labeled data, 2) SSSS with a\nfew pixel-level labeled data, and 3) SSSS with a few pixel-level labeled data\nand many image-level labeled data.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) show strong expressive power on graph data\nmining, by aggregating information from neighbors and using the integrated\nrepresentation in the downstream tasks. The same aggregation methods and\nparameters for each node in a graph are used to enable the GNNs to utilize the\nhomophily relational data. However, not all graphs are homophilic, even in the\nsame graph, the distributions may vary significantly. Using the same\nconvolution over all nodes may lead to the ignorance of various graph patterns.\nFurthermore, many existing GNNs integrate node features and structure\nidentically, which ignores the distributions of nodes and further limits the\nexpressive power of GNNs. To solve these problems, we propose Meta Weight Graph\nNeural Network (MWGNN) to adaptively construct graph convolution layers for\ndifferent nodes. First, we model the Node Local Distribution (NLD) from node\nfeature, topological structure and positional identity aspects with the\nMeta-Weight. Then, based on the Meta-Weight, we generate the adaptive graph\nconvolutions to perform a node-specific weighted aggregation and boost the node\nrepresentations. Finally, we design extensive experiments on real-world and\nsynthetic benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of MWGNN. These experiments\nshow the excellent expressive power of MWGNN in dealing with graph data with\nvarious distributions.",

    "abstract": "Because of the current COVID-19 pandemic with its increasing fears among\npeople, it has triggered several health complications such as depression and\nanxiety. Such complications have not only affected the developed countries but\nalso developing countries such as Nepal. These complications can be understood\nfrom peoples' tweets/comments posted online after their proper analysis and\nsentiment classification. Nevertheless, owing to the limited number of\ntokens/words in each tweet, it is always crucial to capture multiple\ninformation associated with them for their better understanding. In this study,\nwe, first, represent each tweet by combining both syntactic and semantic\ninformation, called hybrid features. The syntactic information is generated\nfrom the bag of words method, whereas the semantic information is generated\nfrom the combination of the fastText-based (ft) and domain-specific (ds)\nmethods. Second, we design a novel multi-channel convolutional neural network\n(MCNN), which ensembles the multiple CNNs, to capture multi-scale information\nfor better classification. Last, we evaluate the efficacy of both the proposed\nfeature extraction method and the MCNN model classifying tweets into three\nsentiment classes (positive, neutral and negative) on NepCOV19Tweets dataset,\nwhich is the only public COVID-19 tweets dataset in Nepali language. The\nevaluation results show that the proposed hybrid features outperform individual\nfeature extraction methods with the highest classification accuracy of 69.7%\nand the MCNN model outperforms the existing methods with the highest\nclassification accuracy of 71.3% during classification.",

To alleviate this issue, we propose to relax the requirement of\nreconstructing an intermediate frame as close to the GT as possible. Towards\nthis end, we develop a texture consistency loss (TCL) upon the assumption that\nthe interpolated content should maintain similar structures with their\ncounterparts in the given frames. Predictions satisfying this constraint are\nencouraged, though they may differ from the pre-defined GT. Without the bells\nand whistles, our plug-and-play TCL is capable of improving the performance of\nexisting VFI frameworks. On the other hand, previous methods usually adopt the\ncost volume or correlation map to achieve more accurate image/feature warping.\nHowever, the O(N^2) ({N refers to the pixel count}) computational complexity\nmakes it infeasible for high-resolution cases.

    "abstract": "This work focuses on tackling the challenging but realistic visual task of\nIncremental Few-Shot Learning (IFSL), which requires a model to continually\nlearn novel classes from only a few examples while not forgetting the base\nclasses on which it was pre-trained. Our study reveals that the challenges of\nIFSL lie in both inter-class separation and novel-class representation. Dur to\nintra-class variation, a novel class may implicitly leverage the knowledge from\nmultiple base classes to construct its feature representation. Hence, simply\nreusing the pre-trained embedding space could lead to a scattered feature\ndistribution and result in category confusion. To address such issues, we\npropose a two-step learning strategy referred to as \\textbf{Im}planting and\n\\textbf{Co}mpressing (\\textbf{IMCO}), which optimizes both feature space\npartition and novel class reconstruction in a systematic manner. Specifically,\nin the \\textbf{Implanting} step, we propose to mimic the data distribution of\nnovel classes with the assistance of data-abundant base set, so that a model\ncould learn semantically-rich features that are beneficial for discriminating\nbetween the base and other unseen classes. In the \\textbf{Compressing} step, we\nadapt the feature extractor to precisely represent each novel class for\nenhancing intra-class compactness, together with a regularized parameter\nupdating rule for preventing aggressive model updating.

To solve this issue, existing methods usually compute self-attention\nlocally by grouping the points into clusters of the same size, or perform\nconvolutional self-attention on a discretized representation. However, the\nformer results in stochastic point dropout, while the latter typically has\nnarrow attention fields. In this paper, we propose a novel voxel-based\narchitecture, namely Voxel Set Transformer (VoxSeT), to detect 3D objects from\npoint clouds by means of set-to-set translation. VoxSeT is built upon a\nvoxel-based set attention (VSA) module, which reduces the self-attention in\neach voxel by two cross-attentions and models features in a hidden space\ninduced by a group of latent codes. With the VSA module, VoxSeT can manage\nvoxelized point clusters with arbitrary size in a wide range, and process them\nin parallel with linear complexity. The proposed VoxSeT integrates the high\nperformance of transformer with the efficiency of voxel-based model, which can\nbe used as a good alternative to the convolutional and point-based backbones.\nVoxSeT reports competitive results on the KITTI and Waymo detection benchmarks.\nThe source codes can be found at \\url{https://github.com/skyhehe123/VoxSeT}.",

    "abstract": "Continual Learning requires the model to learn from a stream of dynamic,\nnon-stationary data without forgetting previous knowledge. Several approaches\nhave been developed in the literature to tackle the Continual Learning\nchallenge. Among them, Replay approaches have empirically proved to be the most\neffective ones. Replay operates by saving some samples in memory which are then\nused to rehearse knowledge during training in subsequent tasks. However, an\nextensive comparison and deeper understanding of different replay\nimplementation subtleties is still missing in the literature. The aim of this\nwork is to compare and analyze existing replay-based strategies and provide\npractical recommendations on developing efficient, effective and generally\napplicable replay-based strategies. In particular, we investigate the role of\nthe memory size value, different weighting policies and discuss about the\nimpact of data augmentation, which allows reaching better performance with\nlower memory sizes.",

To preserve differential privacy, a random\nnoise adding mechanism is widely adopted, where the trade-off between data\nprivacy level and data utility is of great concern. The privacy and utility\nproperties for the continuous noise adding mechanism have been well studied.\nHowever, the related works are insufficient for the discrete random mechanism\non discretely distributed data, e.g., traffic data, health records. This paper\nfocuses on the discrete random noise adding mechanisms. We study the basic\ndifferential privacy conditions and properties for the general discrete random\nmechanisms, as well as the trade-off between data privacy and data utility.\nSpecifically, we derive a sufficient and necessary condition for discrete\nepsilon-differential privacy and a sufficient condition for discrete (epsilon,\ndelta)-differential privacy, with the numerical estimation of differential\nprivacy parameters. These conditions can be applied to analyze the differential\nprivacy properties for the discrete noise adding mechanisms with various kinds\nof noises. Then, with the differential privacy guarantees, we propose an\noptimal discrete epsilon-differential private noise adding mechanism under the\nutility-maximization framework, where the utility is characterized by the\nsimilarity of the statistical properties between the mechanism's input and\noutput. For this setup, we find that the class of the discrete noise\nprobability distributions in the optimal mechanism is Staircase-shaped.",

In particular, truncated linear models greatly reduce the\nproblem of overshooting the minimum of the loss function. Unfortunately,\ntruncated linear models cannot be used with parameter-free algorithms because\nthe updates become very expensive to compute. In this paper, we propose new\nparameter-free algorithms that can take advantage of truncated linear models\nthrough a new update that has an \"implicit\" flavor.

A complete list of metrics to evaluate VFL algorithms should include\nmodel applicability, privacy security, communication cost, and computation\nefficiency, where privacy security is especially important to VFL. However, to\nthe best of our knowledge, there does not exist a VFL algorithm satisfying all\nthese criteria very well. To address this challenging problem, in this paper,\nwe reveal that zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is a desirable companion for\nVFL. Specifically, ZOO can 1) improve the model applicability of VFL framework,\n2) prevent VFL framework from privacy leakage under curious, colluding, and\nmalicious threat models, 3) support inexpensive communication and efficient\ncomputation. Based on that, we propose a novel and practical VFL framework with\nblack-box models, which is inseparably interconnected to the promising\nproperties of ZOO.

    "abstract": "Due to the lack of properly annotated medical data, exploring the\ngeneralization capability of the deep model is becoming a public concern.\nZero-shot learning (ZSL) has emerged in recent years to equip the deep model\nwith the ability to recognize unseen classes. However, existing studies mainly\nfocus on natural images, which utilize linguistic models to extract auxiliary\ninformation for ZSL. It is impractical to apply the natural image ZSL solutions\ndirectly to medical images, since the medical terminology is very\ndomain-specific, and it is not easy to acquire linguistic models for the\nmedical terminology. In this work, we propose a new paradigm of ZSL\nspecifically for medical images utilizing cross-modality information. We make\nthree main contributions with the proposed paradigm. First, we extract the\nprior knowledge about the segmentation targets, called relation prototypes,\nfrom the prior model and then propose a cross-modality adaptation module to\ninherit the prototypes to the zero-shot model. Second, we propose a relation\nprototype awareness module to make the zero-shot model aware of information\ncontained in the prototypes. Last but not least, we develop an inheritance\nattention module to recalibrate the relation prototypes to enhance the\ninheritance process.

While there has been notable headway, current\nbenchmarks either do not provide suitable exposure nor intuitive control of the\nunderlying factors, are not easy-to-implement, customizable, or extensible, or\nare computationally expensive to run. We built the Sandbox Environment for\nGeneralizable Agent Research (SEGAR) with all of these things in mind. SEGAR\nimproves the ease and accountability of generalization research in RL, as\ngeneralization objectives can be easy designed by specifying task\ndistributions, which in turns allows the researcher to measure the nature of\nthe generalization objective. We present an overview of SEGAR and how it\ncontributes to these goals, as well as experiments that demonstrate a few types\nof research questions SEGAR can help answer.",

    "abstract": "Online recommender systems should be always aligned with users' current\ninterest to accurately suggest items that each user would like. Since user\ninterest usually evolves over time, the update strategy should be flexible to\nquickly catch users' current interest from continuously generated new user-item\ninteractions. Existing update strategies focus either on the importance of each\nuser-item interaction or the learning rate for each recommender parameter, but\nsuch one-directional flexibility is insufficient to adapt to varying\nrelationships between interactions and parameters. In this paper, we propose\nMeLON, a meta-learning based novel online recommender update strategy that\nsupports two-directional flexibility. It is featured with an adaptive learning\nrate for each parameter-interaction pair for inducing a recommender to quickly\nlearn users' up-to-date interest. The procedure of MeLON is optimized following\na meta-learning approach: it learns how a recommender learns to generate the\noptimal learning rates for future updates. Specifically, MeLON first enriches\nthe meaning of each interaction based on previous interactions and identifies\nthe role of each parameter for the interaction; and then combines these two\npieces of information to generate an adaptive learning rate. Theoretical\nanalysis and extensive evaluation on three real-world online recommender\ndatasets validate the effectiveness of MeLON.",

    "abstract": "Recently, prefix-tuning has gained increasing attention as a\nparameter-efficient finetuning method for large-scale pretrained language\nmodels. The method keeps the pretrained models fixed and only updates the\nprefix token parameters for each downstream task. Despite being lightweight and\nmodular, prefix-tuning still lacks robustness to textual adversarial attacks.\nHowever, most currently developed defense techniques necessitate auxiliary\nmodel update and storage, which inevitably hamper the modularity and low\nstorage of prefix-tuning. In this work, we propose a robust prefix-tuning\nframework that preserves the efficiency and modularity of prefix-tuning. The\ncore idea of our framework is leveraging the layerwise activations of the\nlanguage model by correctly-classified training data as the standard for\nadditional prefix finetuning. During the test phase, an extra batch-level\nprefix is tuned for each batch and added to the original prefix for robustness\nenhancement. Extensive experiments on three text classification benchmarks show\nthat our framework substantially improves robustness over several strong\nbaselines against five textual attacks of different types while maintaining\ncomparable accuracy on clean texts.

    "abstract": "Object rearrangement is important for many applications but remains\nchallenging, especially in confined spaces, such as shelves, where objects\ncannot be easily accessed from above and they block reachability to each other.\nSuch constraints require many motion planning and collision checking calls,\nwhich are computationally expensive. In addition, the arrangement space (space\nof possible object placements) grows exponentially with the number of objects.\nTo address these issues, this work introduces a lazy evaluation framework for\nobject rearrangement in confined spaces. It improves upon a local monotone\nsolver, which extends to a high-quality planner for the general, non-monotone\ncase. Monotone instances are those that can be solved by moving each object at\nmost once. A key insight is that reachability constraints at the grasps for\nobjects' starts and goals can quickly reveal dependencies between objects\nwithout having to execute expensive motion planning queries. The local solver\nbuilds lazily a search tree that respects these reachability constraints\nwithout verifying that the arm paths are collision free. It only collision\nchecks when a promising solution is found given grasp reachability. If a\nmonotone solution is not found, the non-monotone planner loads the lazy search\ntree and explores ways to move objects to intermediate locations from where\nmonotone solutions to the goal can be found. The non-monotone planner also\napplies lazy evaluation to minimize collision checking. Comprehensive\nsimulations and robot demonstrations show that the proposed framework can solve\ndifficult instances in confined spaces with up to 16 objects, which\nstate-of-the-art methods fail to solve. It also achieves high-quality\nsolutions, i.e., only 1.8 additional actions on average are needed for\nnon-monotone instances. It also solves problems faster than alternatives, when\nthe alternatives find a solution.",

We then trained a deep model (PressureVisionNet) to infer a pressure\nimage from a single RGB image. Our model infers pressure for participants\noutside of the training data and outperforms baselines. We also show that the\noutput of our model depends on the appearance of the hand and cast shadows near\ncontact regions. Overall, our results suggest the appearance of a previously\nunobserved human hand can be used to accurately infer applied pressure.",

    "abstract": "Applying high-speed real-time wireless technologies in industrial\napplications has the great potential to reduce the deployment and maintenance\ncosts compared to their wired counterparts. Wireless technologies enhance the\nmobility and reduce the communication jitter and delay for mobile industrial\nequipment, such as mobile collaborative robots. Unfortunately, most existing\nwireless solutions employed in industrial fields either cannot support the\ndesired high-speed communications or cannot guarantee deterministic, real-time\nperformance. A more recent wireless technology, RT-WiFi, achieves a good\nbalance between high-speed data rates and deterministic communication\nperformance. It is however developed on commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS)\nhardware, and takes considerable effort and hardware expertise to maintain and\nupgrade. To address these problems, this paper introduces the software-defined\nradio (SDR)-based RT-WiFi solution which we call SRT-WiFi. SRT-WiFi provides\nfull-stack configurability for high-speed real-time wireless communications. We\npresent the overall system architecture of SRT-WiFi and discuss its key\nfunctions which achieve better timing performance and solve the queue\nmanagement and rate adaptation issues compared to COTS hardware-based RT-WiFi.\nTo achieve effective network management with rate adaptation in multi-cluster\nSRT-WiFi, a novel scheduling problem is formulated and an effective algorithm\nis proposed to solve the problem. A multi-cluster SRT-WiFi testbed is developed\nto validate the design, and extensive experiments are performed to evaluate the\nperformance at both device and system levels.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles utilize urban scene segmentation to understand the real\nworld like a human and react accordingly. Semantic segmentation of normal\nscenes has experienced a remarkable rise in accuracy on conventional\nbenchmarks. However, a significant portion of real-life accidents features\nabnormal scenes, such as those with object deformations, overturns, and\nunexpected traffic behaviors. Since even small mis-segmentation of driving\nscenes can lead to serious threats to human lives, the robustness of such\nmodels in accident scenarios is an extremely important factor in ensuring\nsafety of intelligent transportation systems.\nIn this paper, we propose a Multi-source Meta-learning Unsupervised Domain\nAdaptation (MMUDA) framework, to improve the generalization of segmentation\ntransformers to extreme accident scenes. In MMUDA, we make use of Multi-Domain\nMixed Sampling to augment the images of multiple-source domains (normal scenes)\nwith the target data appearances (abnormal scenes). To train our model, we\nintertwine and study a meta-learning strategy in the multi-source setting for\nrobustifying the segmentation results. We further enhance the segmentation\nbackbone (SegFormer) with a HybridASPP decoder design, featuring large window\nattention spatial pyramid pooling and strip pooling, to efficiently aggregate\nlong-range contextual dependencies. Our approach achieves a mIoU score of\n46.97% on the DADA-seg benchmark, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art\nmodel by more than 7.50%.

The terminology of vulnerability\nchaining blindness is proposed to understand the underlying issues behind\nvulnerability management and vulnerabilities that can be used in combination.\nThe general problem is that IT and cybersecurity professionals have a difficult\ntime identifying chained vulnerabilities due to the complexity of vulnerability\nprioritization and remediation (Abomhara & K{\\o}ien, 2015; Felmetsger et al.,\n2010). The specific problem is the inability to link and view multiple\nvulnerabilities in combination based on limited expertise and awareness of\nvulnerability chaining (Tang et al., 2017). The population of this study was\nlimited to one focus group, within the IT and Security fields, within the\nUnited States. The sample size consisted of one focus group comprised of 8-10\nIT and cybersecurity professionals. The research questions focused on if\nparticipants were aware of linkage blindness or vulnerability chaining, as well\nas if vulnerability chaining blindness would be applicable to describe the\nphenomenon. Several themes emerged through top-level, eclectic, and\nsecond-level coding data analysis. These themes included complexity in\ncybersecurity programs, new concepts in vulnerability management, as well as\nfear of the unknown and where security meets technology.\nKeywords: linkage blindness, vulnerability chaining, vulnerability chaining\nblindness, vulnerability management",

Here, the human may not necessarily be a\nrobotics expert, but will need to establish a baseline understanding of the\nrobot's abilities in order to appropriately utilize and rely on the robot. This\nwillingness to rely, also known as trust, is based partly on the human's belief\nin the robot's proficiency at a given task. If trust is too high, the human may\npush the robot beyond its capabilities. If trust is too low, the human may not\nutilize it when they otherwise could have, wasting precious resources. In this\nwork, we develop and execute an online human-subjects study to investigate how\nrobot proficiency self-assessment reports based on Factorized Machine\nSelf-Confidence affect operator trust and task performance in a grid world\nnavigation task. Additionally we present and analyze a metric for trust level\nassessment, which measures the allocation of control between an operator and\nrobot when the human teammate is free to switch between teleportation and\nautonomous control. Our results show that an a priori robot self-assessment\nreport aligns operator trust with robot proficiency, and leads to performance\nimprovements and small increases in self-reported trust.",

In this paper, we translate the success of zero-shot vision models\n(e.g., CLIP) to the popular embodied AI task of object navigation. In our\nsetting, an agent must find an arbitrary goal object, specified via text, in\nunseen environments coming from different datasets. Our key insight is to\nmodularize the task into zero-shot object localization and exploration.\nEmploying this philosophy, we design CLIP on Wheels (CoW) baselines for the\ntask and evaluate each zero-shot model in both Habitat and RoboTHOR simulators.\nWe find that a straightforward CoW, with CLIP-based object localization plus\nclassical exploration, and no additional training, often outperforms learnable\napproaches in terms of success, efficiency, and robustness to dataset\ndistribution shift.

Existing techniques often attempt\nto transfer powerful machine translation (MT) capabilities to ST, but neglect\nthe representation discrepancy across modalities. In this paper, we propose the\nSpeech-TExt Manifold Mixup (STEMM) method to calibrate such discrepancy.\nSpecifically, we mix up the representation sequences of different modalities,\nand take both unimodal speech sequences and multimodal mixed sequences as input\nto the translation model in parallel, and regularize their output predictions\nwith a self-learning framework. Experiments on MuST-C speech translation\nbenchmark and further analysis show that our method effectively alleviates the\ncross-modal representation discrepancy, and achieves significant improvements\nover a strong baseline on eight translation directions.",

    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) is the state-of-the-art method for\nlearning graph-structured data, and training large-scale GCNs requires\ndistributed training across multiple accelerators such that each accelerator is\nable to hold a partitioned subgraph. However, distributed GCN training incurs\nprohibitive overhead of communicating node features and feature gradients among\npartitions for every GCN layer during each training iteration, limiting the\nachievable training efficiency and model scalability. To this end, we propose\nPipeGCN, a simple yet effective scheme that hides the communication overhead by\npipelining inter-partition communication with intra-partition computation. It\nis non-trivial to pipeline for efficient GCN training, as communicated node\nfeatures/gradients will become stale and thus can harm the convergence,\nnegating the pipeline benefit. Notably, little is known regarding the\nconvergence rate of GCN training with both stale features and stale feature\ngradients. This work not only provides a theoretical convergence analysis but\nalso finds the convergence rate of PipeGCN to be close to that of the vanilla\ndistributed GCN training without any staleness. Furthermore, we develop a\nsmoothing method to further improve PipeGCN's convergence. Extensive\nexperiments show that PipeGCN can largely boost the training throughput\n(1.7x~28.5x) while achieving the same accuracy as its vanilla counterpart and\nexisting full-graph training methods.

Current approaches\ndecouple the HGT detection task into separate branches of salient object\ndetection and human gaze prediction, employing a two-stage framework where\nhuman head locations must first be detected and then be fed into the next gaze\ntarget prediction sub-network. In contrast, we redefine the HGT detection task\nas detecting human head locations and their gaze targets, simultaneously. By\nthis way, our method, named Human-Gaze-Target detection TRansformer or HGTTR,\nstreamlines the HGT detection pipeline by eliminating all other additional\ncomponents. HGTTR reasons about the relations of salient objects and human gaze\nfrom the global image context. Moreover, unlike existing two-stage methods that\nrequire human head locations as input and can predict only one human's gaze\ntarget at a time, HGTTR can directly predict the locations of all people and\ntheir gaze targets at one time in an end-to-end manner. The effectiveness and\nrobustness of our proposed method are verified with extensive experiments on\nthe two standard benchmark datasets, GazeFollowing and VideoAttentionTarget.\nWithout bells and whistles, HGTTR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods\nby large margins (6.4 mAP gain on GazeFollowing and 10.3 mAP gain on\nVideoAttentionTarget) with a much simpler architecture.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The majority of detailed patient information in real-world data\n(RWD) is only consistently available in free-text clinical documents. Manual\ncuration is expensive and time-consuming. Developing natural language\nprocessing (NLP) methods for structuring RWD is thus essential for scaling\nreal-world evidence generation.\nMaterials and Methods: Traditional rule-based systems are vulnerable to the\nprevalent linguistic variations and ambiguities in clinical text, and prior\napplications of machine-learning methods typically require sentence-level or\nreport-level labeled examples that are hard to produce at scale. We propose\nleveraging patient-level supervision from medical registries, which are often\nreadily available and capture key patient information, for general RWD\napplications. To combat the lack of sentence-level or report-level annotations,\nwe explore advanced deep-learning methods by combining domain-specific\npretraining, recurrent neural networks, and hierarchical attention.\nResults: We conduct an extensive study on 135,107 patients from the cancer\nregistry of a large integrated delivery network (IDN) comprising healthcare\nsystems in five western US states. Our deep learning methods attain test AUROC\nof 94-99% for key tumor attributes and comparable performance on held-out data\nfrom separate health systems and states.\nDiscussion and Conclusion: Ablation results demonstrate clear superiority of\nthese advanced deep-learning methods over prior approaches. Error analysis\nshows that our NLP system sometimes even corrects errors in registrar labels.\nWe also conduct a preliminary investigation in accelerating registry curation\nand general RWD structuring via assisted curation for over 1.2 million cancer\npatients in this healthcare network.",

We specifically, consider classification models, e.g., image\nclassification and other applications of deep learning. Such models are\nclassification functions that partition their domain and assign a class to each\npartition \\cite{strang2019linear}. Partitions are defined by decision\nboundaries and so is the classification model/function. Convex hull of training\nset may occupy only a subset of the domain, but trained model may partition the\nentire domain and not just the convex hull of training set. This is important\nbecause many of the testing samples may be outside the convex hull of training\nset and the way in which a model partitions its domain outside the convex hull\nwould be influential in its generalization. Using approximation theory, we\nprove that over-parameterization is a necessary condition for having control\nover the partitioning of the domain outside the convex hull of training set. We\nalso propose a more clear definition for the notion of over-parametrization\nbased on the learning task and the training set at hand.

    "abstract": "Video super-resolution is currently one of the most active research topics in\ncomputer vision as it plays an important role in many visual applications.\nGenerally, video super-resolution contains a significant component, i.e.,\nmotion compensation, which is used to estimate the displacement between\nsuccessive video frames for temporal alignment. Optical flow, which can supply\ndense and sub-pixel motion between consecutive frames, is among the most common\nways for this task. To obtain a good understanding of the effect that optical\nflow acts in video super-resolution, in this work, we conduct a comprehensive\nreview on this subject for the first time. This investigation covers the\nfollowing major topics: the function of super-resolution (i.e., why we require\nsuper-resolution); the concept of video super-resolution (i.e., what is video\nsuper-resolution); the description of evaluation metrics (i.e., how (video)\nsuperresolution performs); the introduction of optical flow based video\nsuper-resolution; the investigation of using optical flow to capture temporal\ndependency for video super-resolution. Prominently, we give an in-depth study\nof the deep learning based video super-resolution method, where some\nrepresentative algorithms are analyzed and compared. Additionally, we highlight\nsome promising research directions and open issues that should be further\naddressed.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new adapter network for adapting a pre-trained\ndeep neural network to a target domain with minimal computation. The proposed\nmodel, unidirectional thin adapter (UDTA), helps the classifier adapt to new\ndata by providing auxiliary features that complement the backbone network. UDTA\ntakes outputs from multiple layers of the backbone as input features but does\nnot transmit any feature to the backbone. As a result, UDTA can learn without\ncomputing the gradient of the backbone, which saves computation for training\nsignificantly. In addition, since UDTA learns the target task without modifying\nthe backbone, a single backbone can adapt to multiple tasks by learning only\nUDTAs separately. In experiments on five fine-grained classification datasets\nconsisting of a small number of samples, UDTA significantly reduced computation\nand training time required for backpropagation while showing comparable or even\nimproved accuracy compared with conventional adapter models.",

However, for\nservice providers to guarantee the Service-Level-Agreement (SLA) priorities,\nthe complex networked environment brings inherent challenges such as\nmulti-resource heterogeneity, resource competition, and networked system\ndynamics. In this paper, we design a framework for the edge-cloud system,\nnamely EdgeMatrix, to maximize the throughput while guaranteeing various SLA\npriorities. First, EdgeMatrix introduces Networked Multi-agent Actor-Critic\n(NMAC) algorithm to redefine physical resources as logically isolated resource\ncombinations, i.e., resource cells. Then, we use a clustering algorithm to\ngroup the cells with similar characteristics into various sets, i.e., resource\nchannels, for different channels can offer different SLA guarantees. Besides,\nwe design a multi-task mechanism to solve the problem of joint service\norchestration and request dispatch (JSORD) among edge-cloud clusters,\nsignificantly reducing the runtime than traditional methods. To ensure\nstability, EdgeMatrix adopts a two-time-scale framework, i.e., coordinating\nresources and services at the large time scale and dispatching requests at the\nsmall time scale. The real trace-based experimental results verify that\nEdgeMatrix can improve system throughput in complex networked environments,\nreduce SLA violations, and significantly reduce the runtime than traditional\nmethods.",

With this strategy,\nnumerous novel designs have been proposed in visualization publications to\naccomplish various visual analytic tasks. These well-crafted composite\nvisualizations have formed a valuable collection for designers and researchers\nto address real-world problems and inspire new research topics and designs.\nHowever, there is a lack of understanding of design patterns of composite\nvisualization, thus failing to provide holistic design space and concrete\nexamples for practical use. In this paper, we opted to revisit the composite\nvisualizations in VIS publications and answered what and how visualizations of\ndifferent types are composed together. To achieve this, we first constructed a\ncorpus of composite visualizations from IEEE VIS publications and decomposed\nthem into a series of basic visualization types (e.g., bar chart, map, and\nmatrix). With this corpus, we studied the spatial (e.g., separated or\noverlaying) and semantic relationships (e.g., with same types or shared axis)\nbetween visualizations and proposed a taxonomy consisting of eight different\ndesign patterns (e.g., repeated, stacked, accompanied, and nested).\nFurthermore, we analyzed and discussed common practices of composite\nvisualizations, such as the distribution of different patterns and correlations\nbetween visualization types. From the analysis and examples, we obtained\ninsights into different design patterns on the utilities, advantages, and\ndisadvantages.

However,this\nkind of method can not gain satisfactory results when dealing with complex\nsemantic features. To solve this problem, we propose a sentence matching method\nbased on deep encoding and interaction to extract deep semantic information.

However, the\nstatic and dynamic convolutions are either layout-agnostic or\ncomputation-heavy, making it inappropriate for layout-specific applications,\ne.g., face recognition and medical image segmentation. We observe that these\napplications naturally exhibit the characteristics of large intra-image\n(spatial) variance and small cross-image variance. This observation motivates\nour efficient translation variant convolution (TVConv) for layout-aware visual\nprocessing. Technically, TVConv is composed of affinity maps and a\nweight-generating block. While affinity maps depict pixel-paired relationships\ngracefully, the weight-generating block can be explicitly overparameterized for\nbetter training while maintaining efficient inference. Although conceptually\nsimple, TVConv significantly improves the efficiency of the convolution and can\nbe readily plugged into various network architectures. Extensive experiments on\nface recognition show that TVConv reduces the computational cost by up to 3.1x\nand improves the corresponding throughput by 2.3x while maintaining a high\naccuracy compared to the depthwise convolution. Moreover, for the same\ncomputation cost, we boost the mean accuracy by up to 4.21%. We also conduct\nexperiments on the optic disc/cup segmentation task and obtain better\ngeneralization performance, which helps mitigate the critical data scarcity\nissue.

    "abstract": "Recently self-supervised representation learning has drawn considerable\nattention from the scene text recognition community. Different from previous\nstudies using contrastive learning, we tackle the issue from an alternative\nperspective, i.e., by formulating the representation learning scheme in a\ngenerative manner. Typically, the neighboring image patches among one text line\ntend to have similar styles, including the strokes, textures, colors, etc.\nMotivated by this common sense, we augment one image patch and use its\nneighboring patch as guidance to recover itself. Specifically, we propose a\nSimilarity-Aware Normalization (SimAN) module to identify the different\npatterns and align the corresponding styles from the guiding patch. In this\nway, the network gains representation capability for distinguishing complex\npatterns such as messy strokes and cluttered backgrounds. Experiments show that\nthe proposed SimAN significantly improves the representation quality and\nachieves promising performance. Moreover, we surprisingly find that our\nself-supervised generative network has impressive potential for data synthesis,\ntext image editing, and font interpolation, which suggests that the proposed\nSimAN has a wide range of practical applications.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that the passive stereo system cannot adapt well to weak\ntexture objects, e.g., white walls. However, these weak texture targets are\nvery common in indoor environments. In this paper, we present a novel stereo\nsystem, which consists of two cameras (an RGB camera and an IR camera) and an\nIR speckle projector. The RGB camera is used both for depth estimation and\ntexture acquisition. The IR camera and the speckle projector can form a\nmonocular structured-light (MSL) subsystem, while the two cameras can form a\nbinocular stereo subsystem. The depth map generated by the MSL subsystem can\nprovide external guidance for the stereo matching networks, which can improve\nthe matching accuracy significantly. In order to verify the effectiveness of\nthe proposed system, we build a prototype and collect a test dataset in indoor\nscenes. The evaluation results show that the Bad 2.0 error of the proposed\nsystem is 28.2% of the passive stereo system when the network RAFT is used.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present NeuralReshaper, a novel method for semantic\nreshaping of human bodies in single images using deep generative networks. To\nachieve globally coherent reshaping effects, our approach follows a\nfit-then-reshape pipeline, which first fits a parametric 3D human model to a\nsource human image and then reshapes the fitted 3D model with respect to\nuser-specified semantic attributes. Previous methods rely on image warping to\ntransfer 3D reshaping effects to the entire image domain and thus often cause\ndistortions in both foreground and background. Instead, to achieve more\nrealistic reshaping results, we resort to generative adversarial nets\nconditioned on the source image and a 2D warping field induced by the reshaped\n3D model. Specifically, we separately encode the foreground and background\ninformation in the source image using a two-headed U-net-like generator and\nguide the information flow from the foreground branch to the background branch\nvia feature space warping. Furthermore, to deal with the lack-of-data problem\nthat no paired data exist (i.e., the same human bodies in varying shapes), we\nintroduce a novel weakly-supervised strategy to train our network. Besides,\nunlike previous methods that often require manual efforts to correct\nundesirable artifacts caused by incorrect body-to-image fitting, our method is\nfully automatic. Extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method over previous approaches.",

Not only is a concept of trackability introduced formally\nfor any specified trajectory in ILC, but also some related trackability\ncriteria are established. Further, the relation between the trackability and\nthe perfect tracking tasks for ILC is bridged, based on which a new convergence\nanalysis approach is developed for ILC by leveraging properties of a functional\nCauchy sequence (FCS).

    "title": "An Adaptive and Scalable ANN-based Model-Order-Reduction Method for  Large-Scale TO Designs",
    "abstract": "Topology Optimization (TO) provides a systematic approach for obtaining\nstructure design with optimum performance of interest. However, the process\nrequires numerical evaluation of objective function and constraints at each\niteration, which is computational expensive especially for large-scale design.\nDeep learning-based models have been developed to accelerate the process either\nby acting as surrogate models replacing the simulation process, or completely\nreplacing the optimization process. However, most of them require a large set\nof labelled training data, which are generated mostly through simulations. The\ndata generation time scales rapidly with the design domain size, decreasing the\nefficiency of the method itself. Another major issue is the weak\ngeneralizability of most deep learning models. Most models are trained to work\nwith the design problem similar to that used for data generation and require\nretraining if the design problem changes. In this work a scalable deep\nlearning-based model-order-reduction method is proposed to accelerate\nlarge-scale TO process, by utilizing MapNet, a neural network which maps the\nfield of interest from coarse-scale to fine-scale. The proposed method allows\nfor each simulation of the TO process to be performed at a coarser mesh,\nthereby greatly reducing the total computational time. Moreover, by using\ndomain fragmentation, the transferability of the MapNet is largely improved.\nSpecifically, it has been demonstrated that the MapNet trained using data from\none cantilever beam design with a specific loading condition can be directly\napplied to other structure design problems with different domain shapes, sizes,\nboundary and loading conditions.",

The objective of this project, MIDAS\n(Multi-sensorial Immersive Dynamic Autonomous System) is a proof of concept by\nusing an immersive system to improve motivation of stroke patients for hand\nrehabilitation. MIDAS is intended for stroke patients who suffer from light to\nmild stroke. MIDAS is lightweight and portable. It consists of a hand\nexoskeleton subsystem, a Virtual Reality (VR) subsystem, and an olfactory\nsubsystem. Altogether, MIDAS engages four out of five senses during\nrehabilitation. To evaluate the efficacy of MIDAS a pilot study consisting of\nthree sessions is carried out on five stroke affected patients. Subsystems of\nMIDAS are added progressively in each session. The game environment, sonic\neffects, and scent released is carefully chosen to enhance the immersive\nexperience. 60% of the scores of user experience are above 40 (out of 56). 96%\nSelf Rehabilitation Motivation Scale (SRMS) rating shows that the participants\nare motivated to use MIDAS and 87% rating shows that MIDAS is exciting for\nrehabilitation.

    "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language\nprocessing. Recent works treat named entity recognition as a reading\ncomprehension task, constructing type-specific queries manually to extract\nentities. This paradigm suffers from three issues. First, type-specific queries\ncan only extract one type of entities per inference, which is inefficient.\nSecond, the extraction for different types of entities is isolated, ignoring\nthe dependencies between them. Third, query construction relies on external\nknowledge and is difficult to apply to realistic scenarios with hundreds of\nentity types. To deal with them, we propose Parallel Instance Query Network\n(PIQN), which sets up global and learnable instance queries to extract entities\nfrom a sentence in a parallel manner. Each instance query predicts one entity,\nand by feeding all instance queries simultaneously, we can query all entities\nin parallel. Instead of being constructed from external knowledge, instance\nqueries can learn their different query semantics during training. For training\nthe model, we treat label assignment as a one-to-many Linear Assignment Problem\n(LAP) and dynamically assign gold entities to instance queries with minimal\nassignment cost.

    "abstract": "Promising performance has been achieved for visual perception on the point\ncloud. However, the current methods typically rely on labour-extensive\nannotations on the scene scans. In this paper, we explore how synthetic models\nalleviate the real scene annotation burden, i.e., taking the labelled 3D\nsynthetic models as reference for supervision, the neural network aims to\nrecognize specific categories of objects on a real scene scan (without scene\nannotation for supervision). The problem studies how to transfer knowledge from\nsynthetic 3D models to real 3D scenes and is named Referring Transfer Learning\n(RTL). The main challenge is solving the model-to-scene (from a single model to\nthe scene) and synthetic-to-real (from synthetic model to real scene's object)\ngap between the synthetic model and the real scene. To this end, we propose a\nsimple yet effective framework to perform two alignment operations. First,\nphysical data alignment aims to make the synthetic models cover the diversity\nof the scene's objects with data processing techniques. Then a novel\n\\textbf{convex-hull regularized feature alignment} introduces learnable\nprototypes to project the point features of both synthetic models and real\nscenes to a unified feature space, which alleviates the domain gap.

Such violations\noften occur due to the solutions employed and decisions made by developers of\nsuch systems that are misaligned with user values. Stack Overflow is the most\npopular QA website among developers to share their issues, solutions (e.g.,\ncode snippets), and decisions during software development. We conducted an\nexploratory study to investigate the occurrence of human values violations in\nStack Overflow posts. As comments under posts are often used to point out the\npossible issues and weaknesses of the posts, we analyzed 2000 Stack Overflow\ncomments and their corresponding posts (1980 unique questions or answers) to\nidentify the types of human values violations and the reactions of Stack\nOverflow users to such violations. Our study finds that 315 out of 2000\ncomments contain concerns indicating their associated posts (313 unique posts)\nviolate human values. Leveraging Schwartz's theory of basic human values as the\nmost widely used values model, we show that hedonism and benevolence are the\nmost violated value categories. We also find the reaction of Stack Overflow\ncommenters to perceived human values violations is very quick, yet the majority\nof posts (76.35%) accused of human values violation do not get downvoted at\nall. Finally, we find that the original posters rarely react to the concerns of\npotential human values violations by editing their posts. At the same time,\nthey usually are receptive when responding to these comments in follow-up\ncomments of their own.",

In this scheme, higher-dimensional network data are compressed to\nlower-dimensional representations, and then passed to a CNN to perform\nrobustness prediction. Extensive experimental studies on both synthetic and\nreal-world networks, both directed and undirected, demonstrate that 1) the\nproposed LFR-CNN performs better than other two state-of-the-art prediction\nmethods, with significantly lower prediction errors; 2) LFR-CNN is insensitive\nto the variation of the network size, which significantly extends its\napplicability; 3) although LFR-CNN needs more time to perform feature learning,\nit can achieve accurate prediction faster than attack simulations; 4) LFR-CNN\nnot only can accurately predict network robustness, but also provides a good\nindicator for connectivity robustness, better than the classical spectral\nmeasures.",

Past\nresearch aiming to combat its spread has largely focused on identifying its\nsemantic content and media outlets publishing such news. In contrast, we aim to\nidentify individuals who are more likely to share fake-news by studying the\nlanguage of actors in the fake-news ecosystem (such as fake-news sharers,\nfact-check sharers and random twitter users), and creating a linguistic profile\nof them. Fake-news sharers and fact-check sharers use significantly more\nhigh-arousal negative emotions in their language, but fake-news sharers express\nmore existentially-based needs than other actors. Incorporating\npsycholinguistic cues as inferred from their tweets into a model of\nsocio-demographic predictors considerably improves classification accuracy of\nfake-news sharers.

    "abstract": "Image signal processors (ISPs) are historically grown legacy software systems\nfor reconstructing color images from noisy raw sensor measurements. They are\nusually composited of many heuristic blocks for denoising, demosaicking, and\ncolor restoration. Color reproduction in this context is of particular\nimportance, since the raw colors are often severely distorted, and each smart\nphone manufacturer has developed their own characteristic heuristics for\nimproving the color rendition, for example of skin tones and other visually\nimportant colors.\nIn recent years there has been strong interest in replacing the historically\ngrown ISP systems with deep learned pipelines. Much progress has been made in\napproximating legacy ISPs with such learned models. However, so far the focus\nof these efforts has been on reproducing the structural features of the images,\nwith less attention paid to color rendition.\nHere we present CRISPnet, the first learned ISP model to specifically target\ncolor rendition accuracy relative to a complex, legacy smart phone ISP. We\nachieve this by utilizing both image metadata (like a legacy ISP would), as\nwell as by learning simple global semantics based on image classification --\nsimilar to what a legacy ISP does to determine the scene type. We also\ncontribute a new ISP image dataset consisting of both high dynamic range\nmonitor data, as well as real-world data, both captured with an actual cell\nphone ISP pipeline under a variety of lighting conditions, exposure times, and\ngain settings.",

    "abstract": "Researches on analyzing graphs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been\nreceiving more and more attention because of the great expressive power of\ngraphs. GNNs map the adjacency matrix and node features to node representations\nby message passing through edges on each convolution layer. However, the\nmessage passed through GNNs is not always beneficial for all parts in a graph.\nSpecifically, as the data distribution is different over the graph, the\nreceptive field (the farthest nodes that a node can obtain information from)\nneeded to gather information is also different. Existing GNNs treat all parts\nof the graph uniformly, which makes it difficult to adaptively pass the most\ninformative message for each unique part. To solve this problem, we propose two\nregularization terms that consider message passing locally: (1) Intra-Energy\nReg and (2) Inter-Energy Reg. Through experiments and theoretical discussion,\nwe first show that the speed of smoothing of different parts varies enormously\nand the topology of each part affects the way of smoothing. With Intra-Energy\nReg, we strengthen the message passing within each part, which is beneficial\nfor getting more useful information. With Inter-Energy Reg, we improve the\nability of GNNs to distinguish different nodes. With the proposed two\nregularization terms, GNNs are able to filter the most useful information\nadaptively, learn more robustly and gain higher expressiveness. Moreover, the\nproposed LEReg can be easily applied to other GNN models with plug-and-play\ncharacteristics. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks verify that GNNs\nwith LEReg outperform or match the state-of-the-art methods. The effectiveness\nand efficiency are also empirically visualized with elaborate experiments.",

    "abstract": "As robots play an increasingly important role in the industrial, the\nexpectations about their applications for everyday living tasks are getting\nhigher. Robots need to perform long-horizon tasks that consist of several\nsub-tasks that need to be accomplished. Task and Motion Planning (TAMP)\nprovides a hierarchical framework to handle the sequential nature of\nmanipulation tasks by interleaving a symbolic task planner that generates a\npossible action sequence, with a motion planner that checks the kinematic\nfeasibility in the geometric world, generating robot trajectories if several\nconstraints are satisfied, e.g., a collision-free trajectory from one state to\nanother. Hence, the reasoning about the task plan's geometric grounding is\ntaken over by the motion planner. However, motion planning is computationally\nintense and is usability as feasibility checker casts TAMP methods inapplicable\nto real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce neural feasibility\nclassifier (NFC), a simple yet effective visual heuristic for classifying the\nfeasibility of proposed actions in TAMP. Namely, NFC will identify infeasible\nactions of the task planner without the need for costly motion planning, hence\nreducing planning time in multi-step manipulation tasks. NFC encodes the image\nof the robot's workspace into a feature map thanks to convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN). We train NFC using simulated data from TAMP problems and label\nthe instances based on IK feasibility checking. Our empirical results in\ndifferent simulated manipulation tasks show that our NFC generalizes to the\nentire robot workspace and has high prediction accuracy even in scenes with\nmultiple obstructions. When combined with state-of-the-art integrated TAMP, our\nNFC enhances its performance while reducing its planning time.",

In addition, we design a scene-graph in the network to pay attention to\nthe missing parts by the aid of neighboring vehicles.

We argue that MBR\nmodels should: (1) model the coarse-grained commonalities between different\nbehaviors of a user, (2) consider both individual sequence view and global\ngraph view in multi-behavior modeling, and (3) capture the fine-grained\ndifferences between multiple behaviors of a user. In this work, we propose a\nnovel Multi-behavior Multi-view Contrastive Learning Recommendation (MMCLR)\nframework, including three new CL tasks to solve the above challenges,\nrespectively. The multi-behavior CL aims to make different user single-behavior\nrepresentations of the same user in each view to be similar. The multi-view CL\nattempts to bridge the gap between a user's sequence-view and graph-view\nrepresentations.

First, we build a\nManipulation State Graph (MSG) to store the weighted logical relations of\nvarious plate contact states and robot/vacuum lifter configurations, and search\nthe graph to plan efficient and low-cost robot manipulation sequences. Second,\nwe develop a velocity-based impedance controller to coordinate the robot and\nthe vacuum lifter when lifting an object.

The new method can easily be combined with a\nfinite difference method for the spatial discretization. The proposed method is\nshown to have improved qualitative properties compared with the standard\nmethod. First, for any time-step size, the spatial regularity of the solution\nis preserved, at all times. Second, the proposed method preserves the Gaussian\ninvariant distribution of the infinite dimensional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process\nobtained when the nonlinearity is absent, for any time-step size. The weak\norder of convergence of the proposed method is shown to be equal to $1/2$ in a\ngeneral setting, like for the standard Euler scheme. A stronger weak\napproximation result is obtained when considering the approximation of a Gibbs\ninvariant distribution, when the nonlinearity is a gradient: one obtains an\napproximation in total variation distance of order $1/2$, which does not hold\nfor the standard method. This is the first result of this type in the\nliterature. A key point in the analysis is the interpretation of the proposed\nmodified Euler scheme as the accelerated exponential Euler scheme applied to a\nmodified stochastic evolution equation. Finally, it is shown that the proposed\nmethod can be applied to design an asymptotic preserving scheme for a class of\nslow-fast multiscale systems, and to construct a Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nmethod which is well-defined in infinite dimension. We also revisit the\nanalysis of the standard and the accelerated exponential Euler scheme, and we\nprove new results with approximation in the total variation distance, which\nserve to illustrate the behavior of the proposed modified Euler scheme.",

    "abstract": "We study an asymptotic preserving scheme for the temporal discretization of a\nsystem of parabolic semilinear SPDEs with two time scales. Owing to the\naveraging principle, when the time scale separation $\\epsilon$ vanishes, the\nslow component converges to the solution of a limiting evolution equation,\nwhich is captured when the time-step size $\\Delta t$ vanishes by a limiting\nscheme. The objective of this work is to prove weak error estimates which are\nuniform with respect to $\\epsilon$, in terms of $\\Delta t$: the scheme\nsatisfies a uniform accuracy property. This is a non trivial generalization of\na recent article in an infinite dimensional framework. The fast component is\ndiscretized using the modified Euler scheme for SPDEs introduced in a recent\nwork. Proving the weak error estimates requires delicate analysis of the\nregularity properties of solutions of infinite dimensional Kolmogorov\nequations.",

    "abstract": "Building an accurate computer-aided diagnosis system based on data-driven\napproaches requires a large amount of high-quality labeled data. In medical\nimaging analysis, multiple expert annotators often produce subjective estimates\nabout \"ground truth labels\" during the annotation process, depending on their\nexpertise and experience. As a result, the labeled data may contain a variety\nof human biases with a high rate of disagreement among annotators, which\nsignificantly affect the performance of supervised machine learning algorithms.\nTo tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach to combine\nannotations from multiple radiology experts for training a deep learning-based\ndetector that aims to detect abnormalities on medical scans. The proposed\nmethod first estimates the ground truth annotations and confidence scores of\ntraining examples. The estimated annotations and their scores are then used to\ntrain a deep learning detector with a re-weighted loss function to localize\nabnormal findings. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation of the\nproposed approach on both simulated and real-world medical imaging datasets.\nThe experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms\nbaseline approaches that do not consider the disagreements among annotators,\nincluding methods in which all of the noisy annotations are treated equally as\nground truth and the ensemble of different models trained on different label\nsets provided separately by annotators.",

However, the development of diagnostic models for detecting and\ndiagnosing pediatric diseases in CXR scans is undertaken due to the lack of\nhigh-quality physician-annotated datasets. To overcome this challenge, we\nintroduce and release VinDr-PCXR, a new pediatric CXR dataset of 9,125 studies\nretrospectively collected from a major pediatric hospital in Vietnam between\n2020 and 2021. Each scan was manually annotated by a pediatric radiologist who\nhas more than ten years of experience. The dataset was labeled for the presence\nof 36 critical findings and 15 diseases. In particular, each abnormal finding\nwas identified via a rectangle bounding box on the image. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first and largest pediatric CXR dataset containing\nlesion-level annotations and image-level labels for the detection of multiple\nfindings and diseases. For algorithm development, the dataset was divided into\na training set of 7,728 and a test set of 1,397.

Inspired by the observation of the innate\nreactive behavior of animals in nature, we hope to extend this progress in\nrobot locomotion to settings where external, dynamic objects are involved whose\nproperties are partially observable to the robot. As a first step toward this\ngoal, we build a simulation environment in MuJoCo where a legged robot must\navoid getting hit by a ball moving toward it. We explore whether prior\nlocomotion experiences that animals typically possess benefit the learning of a\nreactive control policy under a proposed hierarchical reinforcement learning\nframework.

This has an impact especially in cases of Acute Promyelocytic\nLeukemia (APL) that require urgent treatment. Integration of automated\ncomputational hematopathology into clinical workflows can improve the\nthroughput of these services and reduce cognitive human error. However, a major\nbottleneck in deploying such systems is a lack of sufficient cell morphological\nobject-labels annotations to train deep learning models. We overcome this by\nleveraging patient diagnostic labels to train weakly-supervised models that\ndetect different types of acute leukemia. We introduce a deep learning\napproach, Multiple Instance Learning for Leukocyte Identification (MILLIE),\nable to perform automated reliable analysis of blood films with minimal\nsupervision. Without being trained to classify individual cells, MILLIE\ndifferentiates between acute lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemia in blood\nfilms. More importantly, MILLIE detects APL in blood films (AUC 0.94+/-0.04)\nand in bone marrow aspirates (AUC 0.99+/-0.01).

They require explicit knowledge of\ncar-following dynamics of human-driven vehicles that are non-trivial to\nidentify accurately. In this paper, instead of relying on a parametric\ncar-following model, we introduce a data-driven non-parametric strategy, called\nDeeP-LCC (Data-EnablEd Predictive Leading Cruise Control), to achieve safe and\noptimal control of CAVs in mixed traffic. We first utilize Willems' fundamental\nlemma to obtain a data-centric representation of mixed traffic behavior. This\nis justified by rigorous analysis on controllability and observability\nproperties of mixed traffic. We then employ a receding horizon strategy to\nsolve a finite-horizon optimal control problem at each time step, in which\ninput/output constraints are incorporated for collision-free guarantees.\nNumerical experiments validate the performance of DeeP-LCC compared to a\nstandard predictive controller that requires an accurate model. Extensive\nnonlinear traffic simulations further confirm its great potential on improving\ntraffic efficiency, driving safety, and fuel economy.",

Given the bone CT scans at previous time steps, the\nmodel incorporates the bone-cancer interactions learned from the sequential\nimages and generates future CT images. Its ability of predicting the\ndevelopment of bone lesions in cancer-invading bones can assist in assessing\nthe risk of impending fractures and choosing proper treatments in breast cancer\nbone metastasis. Introduction. Breast cancer often metastasizes to bone, causes\nosteolytic lesions, and results in skeletal related events (SREs) including\nsevere pain and even fatal fractures. Although current imaging techniques can\ndetect macroscopic bone lesions, predicting the occurrence and progression of\nbone lesions remains a challenge. Methods. We adopt a temporal variational\nauto-encoder (T-VAE) model that utilizes a combination of variational\nauto-encoders and long short-term memory networks to predict bone lesion\nemergence on our micro-CT dataset containing sequential images of murine\ntibiae. Given the CT scans of murine tibiae at early weeks, our model can learn\nthe distribution of their future states from data. Results. We test our model\nagainst other deep learning-based prediction models on the bone lesion\nprogression prediction task. Our model produces much more accurate predictions\nthan existing models under various evaluation metrics. Conclusion. We develop a\ndeep learning framework that can accurately predict and visualize the\nprogression of osteolytic bone lesions. It will assist in planning and\nevaluating treatment strategies to prevent SREs in breast cancer patients.",

Whilst a blockchain network's deployment and evaluation are driven by\nits architecture, practitioners still need to learn and carry out many\nrepetitive and error-prone activities to transform architecture into an\noperational blockchain network and evaluate it. Greater efficiency could be\ngained if practitioners focus solely on the architecture design, a valuable and\nhard-to-automate activity, and leave the implementation steps to an automation\nframework. This paper proposes an automation framework called NVAL (Network\nDeployment and Evaluation Framework), which can deploy and evaluate blockchain\nnetworks based on their architecture specifications. The key idea of NVAL is\nreusing and combining the existing automation scripts and utilities of various\nblockchain types to deploy and evaluate incoming blockchain network\narchitectures. We propose a novel meta-model to capture blockchain network\narchitectures as computer-readable artefacts and employ a state-space search\napproach to plan and conduct their deployment and evaluation. An evaluative\ncase study shows that NVAL successfully combines seven deployment and\nevaluation procedures to deploy 65 networks with 12 different architectures and\ngenerate 295 evaluation datasets whilst incurring a negligible processing time\noverhead.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained significant popularity in\northopedic imaging in recent years due to their ability to solve fracture\nclassification problems. A common criticism of CNNs is their opaque learning\nand reasoning process, making it difficult to trust machine diagnosis and the\nsubsequent adoption of such algorithms in clinical setting. This is especially\ntrue when the CNN is trained with limited amount of medical data, which is a\ncommon issue as curating sufficiently large amount of annotated medical imaging\ndata is a long and costly process. While interest has been devoted to\nexplaining CNN learnt knowledge by visualizing network attention, the\nutilization of the visualized attention to improve network learning has been\nrarely investigated. This paper explores the effectiveness of regularizing CNN\nnetwork with human-provided attention guidance on where in the image the\nnetwork should look for answering clues. On two orthopedics radiographic\nfracture classification datasets, through extensive experiments we demonstrate\nthat explicit human-guided attention indeed can direct correct network\nattention and consequently significantly improve classification performance.\nThe development code for the proposed attention guidance is publicly available\non GitHub.",

One way to evaluate the generalization ability of NER models is\nto use adversarial examples, on which the specific variations associated with\nnamed entities are rarely considered. To this end, we propose leveraging\nexpert-guided heuristics to change the entity tokens and their surrounding\ncontexts thereby altering their entity types as adversarial attacks. Using\nexpert-guided heuristics, we augmented the CoNLL 2003 test set and manually\nannotated it to construct a high-quality challenging set.

Although recent works have shown the success of capsule networks on\nsimple objects like digits, the human faces with homologous structures, which\nare suitable for capsules to describe, have not been explored. In this paper,\nwe propose a Hierarchical Parsing Capsule Network (HP-Capsule) for unsupervised\nface subpart-part discovery. When browsing large-scale face images without\nlabels, the network first encodes the frequently observed patterns with a set\nof explainable subpart capsules. Then, the subpart capsules are assembled into\npart-level capsules through a Transformer-based Parsing Module (TPM) to learn\nthe compositional relations between them. During training, as the face\nhierarchy is progressively built and refined, the part capsules adaptively\nencode the face parts with semantic consistency. HP-Capsule extends the\napplication of capsule networks from digits to human faces and takes a step\nforward to show how the neural networks understand homologous objects without\nhuman intervention. Besides, HP-Capsule gives unsupervised face segmentation\nresults by the covered regions of part capsules, enabling qualitative and\nquantitative evaluation.

Further, unlike existing autoregressive models that\nfocus on modeling the local context in a sequence, LocATe's transformer model\nis capable of capturing long-term correlations between actions in a sequence.\nUnlike transformer-based object-detection and classification models which\nconsider image or patch features as input, the input in 3D-TAL is a long\nsequence of highly correlated frames. To handle the high-dimensional input, we\nimplement an effective input representation, and overcome the diffuse attention\nacross long time horizons by introducing sparse attention in the model. LocATe\noutperforms previous approaches on the existing PKU-MMD 3D-TAL benchmark\n(mAP=93.2%). Finally, we argue that benchmark datasets are most useful where\nthere is clear room for performance improvement. To that end, we introduce a\nnew, challenging, and more realistic benchmark dataset, BABEL-TAL-20 (BT20),\nwhere the performance of state-of-the-art methods is significantly worse. The\ndataset and code for the method will be available for research purposes.",

Here, we address this problem by proposing a novel\nalgorithm that combines active learning and semi-supervised learning. Active\nlearning is an approach for identifying the best unlabeled samples to annotate.\nWhile there has been work on active learning for segmentation, most methods\nrequire annotating all pixel objects in each image, rather than only the most\ninformative regions.

Our\nmethod is enriched with semi-supervised learning, where we use pseudo labels\ngenerated with a teacher-student framework to identify image regions that help\ndisambiguate confused classes. We also integrate mechanisms that enable better\nperformance on imbalanced label distributions, which have not been studied\npreviously for active learning in semantic segmentation.

    "abstract": "One of the fundamental problems in machine learning is generalization. In\nneural network models with a large number of weights (parameters), many\nsolutions can be found to fit the training data equally well. The key question\nis which solution can describe testing data not in the training set. Here, we\nreport the discovery of an exact duality (equivalence) between changes in\nactivities in a given layer of neurons and changes in weights that connect to\nthe next layer of neurons in a densely connected layer in any feed forward\nneural network. The activity-weight (A-W) duality allows us to map variations\nin inputs (data) to variations of the corresponding dual weights. By using this\nmapping, we show that the generalization loss can be decomposed into a sum of\ncontributions from different eigen-directions of the Hessian matrix of the loss\nfunction at the solution in weight space. The contribution from a given\neigen-direction is the product of two geometric factors (determinants): the\nsharpness of the loss landscape and the standard deviation of the dual weights,\nwhich is found to scale with the weight norm of the solution. Our results\nprovide an unified framework, which we used to reveal how different\nregularization schemes (weight decay, stochastic gradient descent with\ndifferent batch sizes and learning rates, dropout), training data size, and\nlabeling noise affect generalization performance by controlling either one or\nboth of these two geometric determinants for generalization.

    "abstract": "Pretrained multilingual models enable zero-shot learning even for unseen\nlanguages, and that performance can be further improved via adaptation prior to\nfinetuning. However, it is unclear how the number of pretraining languages\ninfluences a model's zero-shot learning for languages unseen during\npretraining. To fill this gap, we ask the following research questions: (1) How\ndoes the number of pretraining languages influence zero-shot performance on\nunseen target languages? (2) Does the answer to that question change with model\nadaptation? (3) Do the findings for our first question change if the languages\nused for pretraining are all related? Our experiments on pretraining with\nrelated languages indicate that choosing a diverse set of languages is crucial.\nWithout model adaptation, surprisingly, increasing the number of pretraining\nlanguages yields better results up to adding related languages, after which\nperformance plateaus. In contrast, with model adaptation via continued\npretraining, pretraining on a larger number of languages often gives further\nimprovement, suggesting that model adaptation is crucial to exploit additional\npretraining languages.",

A $k$-plex is a subgraph in\nwhich every vertex is adjacent to all but at most $k$ vertices within the\nsubgraph. In this paper, we study the problem of enumerating all large maximal\n$k$-plexes of a graph and develop several new and efficient techniques to solve\nthe problem.

    "abstract": "Mixup is an efficient data augmentation approach that improves the\ngeneralization of neural networks by smoothing the decision boundary with mixed\ndata. Recently, dynamic mixup methods improve previous static policies (e.g.,\nlinear interpolation) by maximizing discriminative regions or maintaining the\nsalient objects in mixed samples. We notice that The mixed samples from dynamic\npolicies are more separable than the static ones while preventing models from\noverfitting. Inspired by this finding, we first argue that there exists an\nover-smoothing issue in the mixup objective, which focuses on regression the\nmixing ratio instead of identifying discriminative features. We are therefore\nprompted to propose a decoupled mixup (DM) loss that can adaptively mine\ndiscriminative features without losing smoothness. DM enables static mixup\nmethods to achieve comparable performance with dynamic methods while avoiding\nheavy computational overhead. This also leads to an interesting objective\ndesign problem for mixup training that we need to focus not only on smoothing\nthe decision boundaries but also on identifying discriminative features.\nExtensive experiments on supervised and semi-supervised learning benchmarks\nacross seven classification datasets validate the effectiveness of DM by\nequipping with various mixup methods.",

Though this fundamental\ntradeoff between nominal performance and robustness is known to exist, it is\nnot well-characterized in quantitative terms. Toward addressing this issue, we\nborrow from the increasingly ubiquitous notion of adversarial training from\nmachine learning to construct a class of controllers which are optimized for\ndisturbances consisting of mixed stochastic and worst-case components. We find\nthat this problem admits a stationary optimal controller that has a simple\nanalytic form closely related to suboptimal $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ solutions. We\nthen provide a quantitative performance-robustness tradeoff analysis, in which\nsystem-theoretic properties such as controllability and stability explicitly\nmanifest in an interpretable manner.

Existing permissionless blockchain-based protocols offer\nunparalleled benefits like decentralization, anonymity, and transparency.\nHowever, these protocols suffer in performance which hinders their widespread\nadoption. In particular, high time-to-finality and low transaction rates keep\nthem from replacing centralized payment systems such as the Visa network.\nPermissioned blockchain protocols offer attractive performance guarantees, but\nthey are not considered suitable for deploying decentralized cryptocurrencies\ndue to their centralized nature. Researchers have developed several\nmulti-layered blockchain protocols that combine both permissioned and\npermissionless blockchain protocols to achieve high performance along with\ndecentralization. The key idea with existing layered blockchain protocols in\nliterature is to divide blockchain operations into two layers and use different\ntypes of blockchain protocols to manage each layer.

These\nassumptions may render the protocols susceptible to security threats in the\nreal world, as highlighted by the literature focused on exploring\ngame-theoretic attacks on these protocols. We generalize the \"layered\" approach\ntaken by existing protocols in the literature and present a framework to\nanalyze the system in the BAR Model and provide a generalized game-theoretic\nanalysis of such protocols.

    "abstract": "In computer-aided design (CAD) community, the point cloud data is pervasively\napplied in reverse engineering, where the point cloud analysis plays an\nimportant role. While a large number of supervised learning methods have been\nproposed to handle the unordered point clouds and demonstrated their remarkable\nsuccess, their performance and applicability are limited to the costly data\nannotation. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised pretraining model\nfor point cloud learning without human annotations, which relies solely on\nupsampling operation to perform feature learning of point cloud in an effective\nmanner. The key premise of our approach is that upsampling operation encourages\nthe network to capture both high-level semantic information and low-level\ngeometric information of the point cloud, thus the downstream tasks such as\nclassification and segmentation will benefit from the pre-trained model.\nSpecifically, our method first conducts the random subsampling from the input\npoint cloud at a low proportion e.g., 12.5%. Then, we feed them into an\nencoder-decoder architecture, where an encoder is devised to operate only on\nthe subsampled points, along with a upsampling decoder is adopted to\nreconstruct the original point cloud based on the learned features. Finally, we\ndesign a novel joint loss function which enforces the upsampled points to be\nsimilar with the original point cloud and uniformly distributed on the\nunderlying shape surface. By adopting the pre-trained encoder weights as\ninitialisation of models for downstream tasks, we find that our UAE outperforms\nprevious state-of-the-art methods in shape classification, part segmentation\nand point cloud upsampling tasks.

    "abstract": "This letter presents a new intelligent control scheme for the accurate\ntrajectory tracking of flexible link manipulators. The proposed approach is\nmainly based on a sliding mode controller for underactuated systems with an\nembedded artificial neural network to deal with modeling inaccuracies. The\nadopted neural network only needs a single input and one hidden layer, which\ndrastically reduces the computational complexity of the control law and allows\nits implementation in low-power microcontrollers. Online learning, rather than\nsupervised offline training, is chosen to allow the weights of the neural\nnetwork to be adjusted in real time during the tracking. Therefore, the\nresulting controller is able to cope with the underactuating issues and to\nadapt itself by learning from experience, which grants the capacity to deal\nwith plant dynamics properly. The boundedness and convergence properties of the\ntracking error are proved by evoking Barbalat's lemma in a Lyapunov-like\nstability analysis. Experimental results obtained with a small single-link\nflexible manipulator show the efficacy of the proposed control scheme, even in\nthe presence of a high level of uncertainty and noisy signals.",

In realistic scenarios,\nthe teachers may also consider other constraints when picking the friendly\npartition: e.g. there may be a group of students whom the teachers wish to\navoid assigning to the same class; alternatively, there may be two close\nfriends whom the teachers want to put together; etc.\nInspired by such challenges, we explore questions concerning the\nexpressiveness of friendly partitions. For example: Does there always exist a\nfriendly partition? More generally, how many friendly partitions are there? Can\nevery student $u$ be separated from any other student $v$? Does there exist a\nstudent $u$ that can be separated from any other student $v$?\nWe show that when $d\\geq 3$ there always exist at least $2$ friendly\npartitions and when $d\\geq 15$ there always exists a student $u$ which can be\nseparated from any other student $v$.

    "abstract": "Scene-dependent adaptive compressive sensing (CS) has been a long pursuing\ngoal which has huge potential in significantly improving the performance of CS.\nHowever, without accessing to the ground truth image, how to design the\nscene-dependent adaptive strategy is still an open-problem and the improvement\nin sampling efficiency is still quite limited. In this paper, a restricted\nisometry property (RIP) condition based error clamping is proposed, which could\ndirectly predict the reconstruction error, i.e. the difference between the\ncurrently-stage reconstructed image and the ground truth image, and adaptively\nallocate samples to different regions at the successive sampling stage.\nFurthermore, we propose a cascaded feature fusion reconstruction network that\ncould efficiently utilize the information derived from different adaptive\nsampling stages. The effectiveness of the proposed adaptive and cascaded CS\nmethod is demonstrated with extensive quantitative and qualitative results,\ncompared with the state-of-the-art CS algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Salient object detection on RGB-D images is an active topic in computer\nvision. Although the existing methods have achieved appreciable performance,\nthere are still some challenges. The locality of convolutional neural network\nrequires that the model has a sufficiently deep global receptive field, which\nalways leads to the loss of local details. To address the challenge, we propose\na novel Group Transformer Network (GroupTransNet) for RGB-D salient object\ndetection. This method is good at learning the long-range dependencies of cross\nlayer features to promote more perfect feature expression. At the beginning,\nthe features of the slightly higher classes of the middle three levels and the\nlatter three levels are soft grouped to absorb the advantages of the high-level\nfeatures. The input features are repeatedly purified and enhanced by the\nattention mechanism to purify the cross modal features of color modal and depth\nmodal. The features of the intermediate process are first fused by the features\nof different layers, and then processed by several transformers in multiple\ngroups, which not only makes the size of the features of each scale unified and\ninterrelated, but also achieves the effect of sharing the weight of the\nfeatures within the group. The output features in different groups complete the\nclustering staggered by two owing to the level difference, and combine with the\nlow-level features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GroupTransNet\noutperforms the comparison models and achieves the new state-of-the-art\nperformance.",

Early\nattempts adopted neural network architectures inherited from applications such\nas computer vision. They often require huge amounts of training samples (i.e.,\npoor generalization), and yield poor performance in large-scale networks (i.e.,\npoor scalability). To resolve these issues, graph neural networks (GNNs) have\nbeen recently adopted, as they can effectively exploit the domain knowledge,\ni.e., the graph topology in wireless communication problems. GNN-based methods\ncan achieve near-optimal performance in large-scale networks and generalize\nwell under different system settings, but the theoretical underpinnings and\ndesign guidelines remain elusive, which may hinder their practical\nimplementations. This paper endeavors to fill both the theoretical and\npractical gaps. For theoretical guarantees, we prove that GNNs achieve\nnear-optimal performance in wireless networks with much fewer training samples\nthan traditional neural architectures. Specifically, to solve an optimization\nproblem on an $n$-node graph (where the nodes may represent users, base\nstations, or antennas), GNNs' generalization error and required number of\ntraining samples are $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ times lower than\nthe unstructured multi-layer perceptrons.

    "abstract": "Image anomaly detection problems aim to determine whether an image is\nabnormal, and to detect anomalous areas. These methods are actively used in\nvarious fields such as manufacturing, medical care, and intelligent\ninformation. Encoder-decoder structures have been widely used in the field of\nanomaly detection because they can easily learn normal patterns in an\nunsupervised learning environment and calculate a score to identify\nabnormalities through a reconstruction error indicating the difference between\ninput and reconstructed images. Therefore, current image anomaly detection\nmethods have commonly used convolutional encoder-decoders to extract normal\ninformation through the local features of images. However, they are limited in\nthat only local features of the image can be utilized when constructing a\nnormal representation owing to the characteristics of convolution operations\nusing a filter of fixed size. Therefore, we propose a vision transformer-based\nencoder-decoder model, named AnoViT, designed to reflect normal information by\nadditionally learning the global relationship between image patches, which is\ncapable of both image anomaly detection and localization. The proposed approach\nconstructs a feature map that maintains the existing location information of\nindividual patches by using the embeddings of all patches passed through\nmultiple self-attention layers. The proposed AnoViT model performed better than\nthe convolution-based model on three benchmark datasets.

Our ARM is\nmotivated by three observations: (1) The performance of different image patches\nvaries with SISR networks of different sizes. (2) There is a tradeoff between\ncomputation overhead and performance of the reconstructed image. (3) Given an\ninput image, its edge information can be an effective option to estimate its\nPSNR. Subsequently, we train an ARM supernet containing SISR subnets of\ndifferent sizes to deal with image patches of various complexity. To that\neffect, we construct an Edge-to-PSNR lookup table that maps the edge score of\nan image patch to the PSNR performance for each subnet, together with a set of\ncomputation costs for the subnets. In the inference, the image patches are\nindividually distributed to different subnets for a better\ncomputation-performance tradeoff. Moreover, each SISR subnet shares weights of\nthe ARM supernet, thus no extra parameters are introduced. The setting of\nmultiple subnets can well adapt the computational cost of SISR model to the\ndynamically available hardware resources, allowing the SISR task to be in\nservice at any time.

Transmit beamforming and phase-shift design are transformed into a\nuniversal optimization problem with ergodic constraints. Then the joint\noptimization of transmit beamforming and phase-shift design is achieved by\ngradient-based, primal-dual proximal policy optimization (PPO) in the\nmulti-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) scenario. Specifically, the\nactor part generates continuous transmit beamforming and the critic part takes\ncharge of discrete phase shift design. Based on the MISO scenario, we\ninvestigate a distributed PPO (DPPO) framework with the concept of\nmulti-threading learning in the multi-user multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) scenario. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nprimal-dual PPO algorithm and its multi-threading version in terms of transmit\nbeamforming and phase-shift design.",

    "abstract": "Navigating to destinations using human speech instructions is an important\ntask for autonomous mobile robots that operate in the real world. Spatial\nrepresentations include a semantic level that represents an abstracted location\ncategory, a topological level that represents their connectivity, and a metric\nlevel that depends on the structure of the environment. The purpose of this\nstudy is to realize a hierarchical spatial representation using a topometric\nsemantic map and planning efficient paths through human-robot interactions. We\npropose a novel probabilistic generative model, SpCoTMHP, that forms a\ntopometric semantic map that adapts to the environment and leads to\nhierarchical path planning. We also developed approximate inference methods for\npath planning, where the levels of the hierarchy can influence each other. The\nproposed path planning method is theoretically supported by deriving a\nformulation based on control as probabilistic inference. The navigation\nexperiment using human speech instruction shows that the proposed spatial\nconcept-based hierarchical path planning improves the performance and reduces\nthe calculation cost compared with conventional methods. Hierarchical spatial\nrepresentation provides a mutually understandable form for humans and robots to\nrender language-based navigation tasks feasible.",

In this\npaper, we address the shortcoming of today's methods via a novel\nneuroevolutionary multitasking (NuEMT) algorithm, designed to transfer\ninformation from a set of auxiliary tasks (of short episode length) to the\ntarget (full length) RL task at hand. The artificially generated auxiliary\ntasks allow an agent to update and quickly evaluate policies on shorter time\nhorizons. The evolved skills are then transferred to guide the longer and\nharder task towards an optimal policy. We demonstrate that the NuEMT algorithm\nachieves data-lean evolutionary RL, reducing expensive agent-environment\ninteraction data requirements. Our key algorithmic contribution in this setting\nis to introduce, for the first time, a multitask information transfer mechanism\nbased on the statistical importance sampling technique. In addition, an\nadaptive resource allocation strategy is utilized to assign computational\nresources to auxiliary tasks based on their gleaned usefulness.

    "abstract": "There has been an increasing interest in incorporating Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) into Defence and military systems to complement and augment\nhuman intelligence and capabilities. However, much work still needs to be done\ntoward achieving an effective human-machine partnership. This work is aimed at\nenhancing human-machine communications by developing a capability for\nautomatically translating human natural language into a machine-understandable\nlanguage (e.g., SQL queries). Techniques toward achieving this goal typically\ninvolve building a semantic parser trained on a very large amount of\nhigh-quality manually-annotated data. However, in many real-world Defence\nscenarios, it is not feasible to obtain such a large amount of training data.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are few works trying to explore the\npossibility of training a semantic parser with limited manually-paraphrased\ndata, in other words, zero-shot. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit\nparaphrasing methods for the automated generation of large-scale training\ndatasets (in the form of paraphrased utterances and their corresponding logical\nforms in SQL format) and present our experimental results using real-world data\nin the maritime domain.",

    "title": "RGB-Depth Fusion GAN for Indoor Depth Completion",
    "abstract": "The raw depth image captured by the indoor depth sensor usually has an\nextensive range of missing depth values due to inherent limitations such as the\ninability to perceive transparent objects and limited distance range. The\nincomplete depth map burdens many downstream vision tasks, and a rising number\nof depth completion methods have been proposed to alleviate this issue. While\nmost existing methods can generate accurate dense depth maps from sparse and\nuniformly sampled depth maps, they are not suitable for complementing the large\ncontiguous regions of missing depth values, which is common and critical. In\nthis paper, we design a novel two-branch end-to-end fusion network, which takes\na pair of RGB and incomplete depth images as input to predict a dense and\ncompleted depth map. The first branch employs an encoder-decoder structure to\nregress the local dense depth values from the raw depth map, with the help of\nlocal guidance information extracted from the RGB image. In the other branch,\nwe propose an RGB-depth fusion GAN to transfer the RGB image to the\nfine-grained textured depth map. We adopt adaptive fusion modules named W-AdaIN\nto propagate the features across the two branches, and we append a confidence\nfusion head to fuse the two outputs of the branches for the final depth map.\nExtensive experiments on NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D demonstrate that our\nproposed method clearly improves the depth completion performance, especially\nin a more realistic setting of indoor environments with the help of the pseudo\ndepth map.",

    "title": "Multi-class Label Noise Learning via Loss Decomposition and Centroid  Estimation",
    "abstract": "In real-world scenarios, many large-scale datasets often contain inaccurate\nlabels, i.e., noisy labels, which may confuse model training and lead to\nperformance degradation. To overcome this issue, Label Noise Learning (LNL) has\nrecently attracted much attention, and various methods have been proposed to\ndesign an unbiased risk estimator to the noise-free dataset to combat such\nlabel noise. Among them, a trend of works based on Loss Decomposition and\nCentroid Estimation (LDCE) has shown very promising performance. However,\nexisting LNL methods based on LDCE are only designed for binary classification,\nand they are not directly extendable to multi-class situations. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel multi-class robust learning method for LDCE, which is termed\n\"MC-LDCE\". Specifically, we decompose the commonly adopted loss (e.g., mean\nsquared loss) function into a label-dependent part and a label-independent\npart, in which only the former is influenced by label noise. Further, by\ndefining a new form of data centroid, we transform the recovery problem of a\nlabel-dependent part to a centroid estimation problem. Finally, by critically\nexamining the mathematical expectation of clean data centroid given the\nobserved noisy set, the centroid can be estimated which helps to build an\nunbiased risk estimator for multi-class learning. The proposed MC-LDCE method\nis general and applicable to different types (i.e., linear and nonlinear) of\nclassification models. The experimental results on five public datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed MC-LDCE against other\nrepresentative LNL methods in tackling multi-class label noise problem.",

In contrast to the well-studied unconstrained\nleast-squares clustering problem, approximating the centroids of the clusters\nno longer suffices in the weight-constrained anisotropic case, as even the\nassignment of the points to best sites is involved. This assignment step is\noften the limiting factor in materials science, a problem that partially\nmotivates our work.

    "abstract": "Modeling latent variables with priors and hyperpriors is an essential problem\nin variational image compression. Formally, trade-off between rate and\ndistortion is handled well if priors and hyperpriors precisely describe latent\nvariables. Current practices only adopt univariate priors and process each\nvariable individually. However, we find inter-correlations and\nintra-correlations exist when observing latent variables in a vectorized\nperspective. These findings reveal visual redundancies to improve\nrate-distortion performance and parallel processing ability to speed up\ncompression. This encourages us to propose a novel vectorized prior.\nSpecifically, a multivariate Gaussian mixture is proposed with means and\ncovariances to be estimated. Then, a novel probabilistic vector quantization is\nutilized to effectively approximate means, and remaining covariances are\nfurther induced to a unified mixture and solved by cascaded estimation without\ncontext models involved. Furthermore, codebooks involved in quantization are\nextended to multi-codebooks for complexity reduction, which formulates an\nefficient compression procedure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\nagainst state-of-the-art indicate our model has better rate-distortion\nperformance and an impressive $3.18\\times$ compression speed up, giving us the\nability to perform real-time, high-quality variational image compression in\npractice.

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised\nframework for DocRE with three novel components.

These models are Euler-Lagrange equations for a\ngiven Lagrangian and share common mathematical structure, namely the dependence\nof the pressure on material derivatives of macroscopic variables. We develop a\ngeneric dispersive model such that SGN and IKW systems become its special cases\nif only one specifies the appropriate Lagrangian, and then use the extended\nLagragian approach proposed in Favrie and Gavrilyuk (2017) to build its\nhyperbolic approximation. The new approximate model is unconditionally\nhyperbolic for both SGN and IKW cases, and accurately describes dispersive\nphenomena, which allows to impose discontinuous initial data and study\ndispersive shock waves. We consider the 2-D hyperbolic version of SGN system as\nan example for numerical simulations and apply a second order implicit-explicit\nscheme in order to numerically integrate the system.

    "abstract": "Cloud-enabled Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has shown enormous\npromise to transform how deep learning models are developed and deployed.\nNonetheless, there is a potential risk associated with the use of such services\nsince a malicious party can modify them to achieve an adverse result.\nTherefore, it is imperative for model owners, service providers, and end-users\nto verify whether the deployed model has not been tampered with or not. Such\nverification requires public verifiability (i.e., fingerprinting patterns are\navailable to all parties, including adversaries) and black-box access to the\ndeployed model via APIs. Existing watermarking and fingerprinting approaches,\nhowever, require white-box knowledge (such as gradient) to design the\nfingerprinting and only support private verifiability, i.e., verification by an\nhonest party.\nIn this paper, we describe a practical watermarking technique that enables\nblack-box knowledge in fingerprint design and black-box queries during\nverification. The service ensures the integrity of cloud-based services through\npublic verification (i.e. fingerprinting patterns are available to all parties,\nincluding adversaries). If an adversary manipulates a model, this will result\nin a shift in the decision boundary. Thus, the underlying principle of\ndouble-black watermarking is that a model's decision boundary could serve as an\ninherent fingerprint for watermarking. Our approach captures the decision\nboundary by generating a limited number of encysted sample fingerprints, which\nare a set of naturally transformed and augmented inputs enclosed around the\nmodel's decision boundary in order to capture the inherent fingerprints of the\nmodel. We evaluated our watermarking approach against a variety of model\nintegrity attacks and model compression attacks.",

Naturally, the benefits of this approach hinge on the quality of\ndemonstrations, which are rarely optimal in realistic scenarios. Modern LfD\nalgorithms require meticulous tuning of hyperparameters that control the\ninfluence of demonstrations and, as we show in the paper, struggle with\nlearning from suboptimal demonstrations. To address these issues, we extend\nSelf-Imitation Learning (SIL), a recent RL algorithm that exploits the agent's\npast good experience, to the LfD setup by initializing its replay buffer with\ndemonstrations. We denote our algorithm as SIL from Demonstrations (SILfD). We\nempirically show that SILfD can learn from demonstrations that are noisy or far\nfrom optimal and can automatically adjust the influence of demonstrations\nthroughout the training without additional hyperparameters or handcrafted\nschedules.

Based on appraisal\ntheories in psychology, which treat emotions as reactions to events, we compile\nan English corpus of written event descriptions.

We annotate all experiencers, including the original\nauthor, with the emotions they likely felt. In addition, we link them to the\nevent they found salient (which can be different for different experiencers in\na text) by annotating event properties, or appraisals (e.g., the perceived\nevent undesirability, the uncertainty of its outcome). Our analysis reveals\npatterns in the co-occurrence of people's emotions in interaction.

While insect legs contact the ground with the tarsal segments\nand pretarsus, most insect-inspired robots come with a simple tarsus such as a\nhemispherical foot tip. Insects, like the M. Torquata beetle, use the claws as\ntheir attachment devices on rough surfaces. Their sharp claws can smoothly\nattach and detach on plant surfaces by actuating one muscle. Thus, legged\nrobots can mimic tarsal structures to improve their locomotion on inclined and\nrough surfaces. We conducted two types of experiments to test the hypothesis\nthat the tarsal flexibility and rigidity play a role in the beetle's smooth\nwalking. By cutting the membrane between the tarsomeres, we disabled the\ntarsus' rigid ability, so the claws cannot securely hook onto the walking\nsurface. Conversely, after eliminating the tarsal flexibility, the beetle\nstruggled to draw the claws out of the substrate. The results confirm the\nsignificance of the tarsus' properties on beetle walking. Then, we designed a\ncable-driven 3D printed tarsus structure to validate the function of the tarsus\nvia a robotic leg.

In spite of recent efforts in this field, how to learn accurate scene\ndepths and alleviate the negative influence of occlusions for self-supervised\ndepth estimation, still remains an open problem. Addressing this problem, we\nfirstly empirically analyze the effects of both the continuous and discrete\ndepth constraints which are widely used in the training process of many\nexisting works. Then inspired by the above empirical analysis, we propose a\nnovel network to learn an Occlusion-aware Coarse-to-Fine Depth map for\nself-supervised monocular depth estimation, called OCFD-Net. Given an arbitrary\ntraining set of stereo image pairs, the proposed OCFD-Net does not only employ\na discrete depth constraint for learning a coarse-level depth map, but also\nemploy a continuous depth constraint for learning a scene depth residual,\nresulting in a fine-level depth map. In addition, an occlusion-aware module is\ndesigned under the proposed OCFD-Net, which is able to improve the capability\nof the learnt fine-level depth map for handling occlusions.

    "abstract": "According to recent studies, the vulnerability of state-of-the-art Neural\nNetworks to adversarial input samples has increased drastically. A neural\nnetwork is an intermediate path or technique by which a computer learns to\nperform tasks using Machine learning algorithms. Machine Learning and\nArtificial Intelligence model has become a fundamental aspect of life, such as\nself-driving cars [1], smart home devices, so any vulnerability is a\nsignificant concern. The smallest input deviations can fool these extremely\nliteral systems and deceive their users as well as administrator into\nprecarious situations. This article proposes a defense algorithm that utilizes\nthe combination of an auto-encoder [3] and block-switching architecture.\nAuto-coder is intended to remove any perturbations found in input images\nwhereas the block switching method is used to make it more robust against\nWhite-box attacks. The attack is planned using FGSM [9] model, and the\nsubsequent counter-attack by the proposed architecture will take place thereby\ndemonstrating the feasibility and security delivered by the algorithm.",

The ROM is constructed in the same way as the\nfull-order model (FOM) applying proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with the\nGalerkin projection. The reduced-order system has the same multi-symplectic\nstructure as the FOM, and preserves the discrete reduced global energy.\nApplying the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), the reduced-order\nsolutions are computed efficiently in the online stage. An a priori error bound\nis derived for the DEIM approximation to the nonlinear Hamiltonian.

Most\ntasks benefit mainly from high quality paraphrases, namely those that are\nsemantically similar to, yet linguistically diverse from, the original\nsentence.

Recent\nworks achieve nice results by controlling specific aspects of the paraphrase,\nsuch as its syntactic tree. However, they do not allow to directly control the\nquality of the generated paraphrase, and suffer from low flexibility and\nscalability. Here we propose $QCPG$, a quality-guided controlled paraphrase\ngeneration model, that allows directly controlling the quality dimensions.\nFurthermore, we suggest a method that given a sentence, identifies points in\nthe quality control space that are expected to yield optimal generated\nparaphrases.

The spreadsheet application's ease of use and\nusefulness has enabled non-programmers to perform programming-like tasks in a\nfamiliar setting modeled after the tabular \"pen and paper\" approach. However,\nspreadsheet applications are limited to bookkeeping-like tasks due to their\nsingle-direction data flow. This thesis demonstrates an extension of the\nspreadsheet computing paradigm in overcoming this limitation to solve\nconstraint satisfaction problems. We present a framework seamlessly\nincorporating a finite constraint solver with the spreadsheet computing\nparadigm. This framework allows the individual cells in the spreadsheet to be\nattached to either a finite domain or a constraint specifying the relationship\namong the cells. The framework provides an interface for constraint solving and\nfurther enhances the spreadsheet computing paradigm by providing a set of\nspreadsheet-specific constraints that will aid in controlling the scalability\nof large spreadsheet applications implementations.

    "abstract": "Implementing an autonomous vehicle that is able to output feasible, smooth\nand efficient trajectories is a long-standing challenge. Several approaches\nhave been considered, roughly falling under two categories: rule-based and\nlearning-based approaches. The rule-based approaches, while guaranteeing safety\nand feasibility, fall short when it comes to long-term planning and\ngeneralization. The learning-based approaches are able to account for long-term\nplanning and generalization to unseen situations, but may fail to achieve\nsmoothness, safety and the feasibility which rule-based approaches ensure.\nHence, combining the two approaches is an evident step towards yielding the\nbest compromise out of both. We propose a Reinforcement Learning-based\napproach, which learns target trajectory parameters for fully autonomous\ndriving on highways. The trained agent outputs continuous trajectory parameters\nbased on which a feasible polynomial-based trajectory is generated and\nexecuted. We compare the performance of our agent against four other highway\ndriving agents.

    "abstract": "Bike sharing is an increasingly popular part of urban transportation systems.\nAccurate demand prediction is the key to support timely re-balancing and ensure\nservice efficiency. Most existing models of bike-sharing demand prediction are\nsolely based on its own historical demand variation, essentially regarding bike\nsharing as a closed system and neglecting the interaction between different\ntransport modes. This is particularly important because bike sharing is often\nused to complement travel through other modes (e.g., public transit). Despite\nsome recent efforts, there is no existing method capable of leveraging\nspatiotemporal information from multiple modes with heterogeneous spatial\nunits. To address this research gap, this study proposes a graph-based deep\nlearning approach for bike sharing demand prediction (B-MRGNN) with multimodal\nhistorical data as input. The spatial dependencies across modes are encoded\nwith multiple intra- and inter-modal graphs. A multi-relational graph neural\nnetwork (MRGNN) is introduced to capture correlations between spatial units\nacross modes, such as bike sharing stations, subway stations, or ride-hailing\nzones.

This usually can be\ntime consuming and work intensive. Moreover, accurate knowledge of the precise\nsolubility limit of the molecule is often not required, and simply measuring a\nthreshold of solubility in each solvent would be sufficient.To address this, we\npropose a novel cascaded deep model that is inspired by how a human chemist\nwould visually assess a sample to determine whether the solid has completely\ndissolved in the solution.

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D object detection is an important yet challenging task in\nautonomous driving. Some existing methods leverage depth information from an\noff-the-shelf depth estimator to assist 3D detection, but suffer from the\nadditional computational burden and achieve limited performance caused by\ninaccurate depth priors. To alleviate this, we propose MonoDTR, a novel\nend-to-end depth-aware transformer network for monocular 3D object detection.\nIt mainly consists of two components: (1) the Depth-Aware Feature Enhancement\n(DFE) module that implicitly learns depth-aware features with auxiliary\nsupervision without requiring extra computation, and (2) the Depth-Aware\nTransformer (DTR) module that globally integrates context- and depth-aware\nfeatures. Moreover, different from conventional pixel-wise positional\nencodings, we introduce a novel depth positional encoding (DPE) to inject depth\npositional hints into transformers. Our proposed depth-aware modules can be\neasily plugged into existing image-only monocular 3D object detectors to\nimprove the performance. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate\nthat our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art monocular-based methods\nand achieves real-time detection.

    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art\nmethod for graph-based learning tasks. However, training GCNs at scale is still\nchallenging, hindering both the exploration of more sophisticated GCN\narchitectures and their applications to real-world large graphs. While it might\nbe natural to consider graph partition and distributed training for tackling\nthis challenge, this direction has only been slightly scratched the surface in\nthe previous works due to the limitations of existing designs. In this work, we\nfirst analyze why distributed GCN training is ineffective and identify the\nunderlying cause to be the excessive number of boundary nodes of each\npartitioned subgraph, which easily explodes the memory and communication costs\nfor GCN training. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method dubbed\nBNS-GCN that adopts random Boundary-Node-Sampling to enable efficient and\nscalable distributed GCN training. Experiments and ablation studies\nconsistently validate the effectiveness of BNS-GCN, e.g., boosting the\nthroughput by up to 16.2x and reducing the memory usage by up to 58%, while\nmaintaining a full-graph accuracy. Furthermore, both theoretical and empirical\nanalysis show that BNS-GCN enjoys a better convergence than existing\nsampling-based methods. We believe that our BNS-GCN has opened up a new\nparadigm for enabling GCN training at scale. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/RICE-EIC/BNS-GCN.",

    "abstract": "Every graph with maximum degree $\\Delta$ can be colored with $(\\Delta+1)$\ncolors using a simple greedy algorithm. Remarkably, recent work has shown that\none can find such a coloring even in the semi-streaming model. But, in reality,\none almost never needs $(\\Delta+1)$ colors to properly color a graph. Indeed,\nthe celebrated \\Brooks' theorem states that every (connected) graph beside\ncliques and odd cycles can be colored with $\\Delta$ colors. Can we find a\n$\\Delta$-coloring in the semi-streaming model as well?\nWe settle this key question in the affirmative by designing a randomized\nsemi-streaming algorithm that given any graph, with high probability, either\ncorrectly declares that the graph is not $\\Delta$-colorable or outputs a\n$\\Delta$-coloring of the graph.\nThe proof of this result starts with a detour. We first (provably) identify\nthe extent to which the previous approaches for streaming coloring fail for\n$\\Delta$-coloring: for instance, all these approaches can handle streams with\nrepeated edges and they can run in $o(n^2)$ time -- we prove that neither of\nthese tasks is possible for $\\Delta$-coloring. These impossibility results\nhowever pinpoint exactly what is missing from prior approaches when it comes to\n$\\Delta$-coloring.\nWe then build on these insights to design a semi-streaming algorithm that\nuses $(i)$ a novel sparse-recovery approach based on sparse-dense\ndecompositions to (partially) recover the \"problematic\" subgraphs of the input\n-- the ones that form the basis of our impossibility results -- and $(ii)$ a\nnew coloring approach for these subgraphs that allows for recoloring of other\nvertices in a controlled way without relying on local explorations or finding\n\"augmenting paths\" that are generally impossible for semi-streaming algorithms.\nWe believe both these techniques can be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "As shared, collaborative, networked, virtual environments become increasingly\npopular, various challenges arise regarding the efficient transmission of model\nand scene transformation data over the network. As user immersion and real-time\ninteractions heavily depend on VR stream synchronization, transmitting the\nentire data sat does not seem a suitable approach, especially for sessions\ninvolving a large number of users. Session recording is another\nmomentum-gaining feature of VR applications that also faces the same challenge.\nThe selection of a suitable data format can reduce the occupied volume, while\nit may also allow effective replication of the VR session and optimized\npost-processing for analytics and deep-learning algorithms. In this work, we\npropose two algorithms that can be applied in the context of a networked\nmultiplayer VR session, to efficiently transmit the displacement and\norientation data from the users' hand-based VR HMDs. Moreover, we present a\nnovel method describing effective VR recording of the data exchanged in such a\nsession. Our algorithms, based on the use of dual-quaternions and multivectors,\nimpact the network consumption rate and are highly effective in scenarios\ninvolving multiple users. By sending less data over the network and\ninterpolating the in-between frames locally, we manage to obtain better visual\nresults than current state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we prove that, for\nrecording purposes, storing less data and interpolating them on-demand yields a\ndata set quantitatively close to the original one.",

So far, it was only used to prune weights.\nWe examine how this method can be used also for activations and their gradients\n(i.e., \"neural gradients\"). To this end, we first establish tensor-level\noptimality criteria. Previous works aimed to minimize the mean-square-error\n(MSE) of each pruned block. We show that while minimization of the MSE works\nfine for pruning the activations, it catastrophically fails for the neural\ngradients. Instead, we show that optimal pruning of the neural gradients\nrequires an unbiased minimum-variance pruning mask. We design such specialized\nmasks, and find that in most cases, 1:2 sparsity is sufficient for training,\nand 2:4 sparsity is usually enough when this is not the case. Further, we\nsuggest combining several such methods together in order to speed up training\neven more.

In this context, this paper proposes two hypotheses\nfor ergonomically effective task delegation and HRC. The first hypothesis\nstates that it is possible to quantify ergonomically professional tasks using\nmotion data from a reduced set of sensors. Then, the most dangerous tasks can\nbe delegated to a collaborative robot. The second hypothesis is that by\nincluding gesture recognition and spatial adaptation, the ergonomics of an HRC\nscenario can be improved by avoiding needless motions that could expose\noperators to ergonomic risks and by lowering the physical effort required of\noperators. An HRC scenario for a television manufacturing process is optimized\nto test both hypotheses. For the ergonomic evaluation, motion primitives with\nknown ergonomic risks were modeled for their detection in professional tasks\nand to estimate a risk score based on the European Assembly Worksheet (EAWS). A\nDeep Learning gesture recognition module trained with egocentric television\nassembly data was used to complement the collaboration between the human\noperator and the robot. Additionally, a skeleton-tracking algorithm provided\nthe robot with information about the operator's pose, allowing it to spatially\nadapt its motion to the operator's anthropometrics. Three experiments were\nconducted to determine the effect of gesture recognition and spatial adaptation\non the operator's range of motion.

    "abstract": "Massive open online courses (MOOCs), which provide a large-scale interactive\nparticipation and open access via the web, are becoming a modish way for online\nand distance education. To help users have a better study experience, many MOOC\nplatforms have provided the services of recommending courses to users. However,\nwe argue that directly recommending a course to users will ignore the expertise\nlevels of different users. To fill this gap, this paper studies the problem of\nconcept recommendation in a more fine-grained view. We propose a novel\nHeterogeneous Information Networks based Concept Recommender with Reinforcement\nLearning (HinCRec-RL) incorporated for concept recommendation in MOOCs.\nSpecifically, we first formulate the concept recommendation in MOOCs as a\nreinforcement learning problem to better model the dynamic interaction among\nusers and knowledge concepts. In addition, to mitigate the data sparsity issue\nwhich also exists in many other recommendation tasks, we consider a\nheterogeneous information network (HIN) among users, courses, videos and\nconcepts, to better learn the semantic representation of users. In particular,\nwe use the meta-paths on HIN to guide the propagation of users' preferences and\npropose a heterogeneous graph attention network to represent the meta-paths. To\nvalidate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on a real-world dataset from XuetangX, a popular MOOC platform from\nChina.

    "abstract": "Learning feature interactions is important to the model performance of online\nadvertising services. As a result, extensive efforts have been devoted to\ndesigning effective architectures to learn feature interactions. However, we\nobserve that the practical performance of those designs can vary from dataset\nto dataset, even when the order of interactions claimed to be captured is the\nsame. That indicates different designs may have different advantages and the\ninteractions captured by them have non-overlapping information. Motivated by\nthis observation, we propose DHEN - a deep and hierarchical ensemble\narchitecture that can leverage strengths of heterogeneous interaction modules\nand learn a hierarchy of the interactions under different orders. To overcome\nthe challenge brought by DHEN's deeper and multi-layer structure in training,\nwe propose a novel co-designed training system that can further improve the\ntraining efficiency of DHEN. Experiments of DHEN on large-scale dataset from\nCTR prediction tasks attained 0.27\\% improvement on the Normalized Entropy (NE)\nof prediction and 1.2x better training throughput than state-of-the-art\nbaseline, demonstrating their effectiveness in practice.",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) describes the adverse effects of drugs that\ndamage liver. Life-threatening results including liver failure or death were\nalso reported in severe DILI cases. Therefore, DILI-related events are strictly\nmonitored for all approved drugs and the liver toxicity became important\nassessments for new drug candidates. These DILI-related reports are documented\nin hospital records, in clinical trial results, and also in research papers\nthat contain preliminary in vitro and in vivo experiments. Conventionally, data\nextraction from previous publications relies heavily on resource-demanding\nmanual labelling, which considerably decreased the efficiency of the\ninformation extraction process. The recent development of artificial\nintelligence, particularly, the rise of natural language processing (NLP)\ntechniques, enabled the automatic processing of biomedical texts. In this\nstudy, based on around 28,000 papers (titles and abstracts) provided by the\nCritical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) challenge, we benchmarked\nmodel performances on filtering out DILI literature. Among four word\nvectorization techniques, the model using term frequency-inverse document\nfrequency (TF-IDF) and logistic regression outperformed others with an accuracy\nof 0.957 with our in-house test set. Furthermore, an ensemble model with\nsimilar overall performances was implemented and was fine-tuned to lower the\nfalse-negative cases to avoid neglecting potential DILI reports. The ensemble\nmodel achieved a high accuracy of 0.954 and an F1 score of 0.955 in the\nhold-out validation data provided by the CAMDA committee. Moreover, important\nwords in positive/negative predictions were identified via model\ninterpretation. Overall, the ensemble model reached satisfactory classification\nresults, which can be further used by researchers to rapidly filter\nDILI-related literature.",

The proposed VDSP\nlearning rule updates the synaptic conductance on the spike of the postsynaptic\nneuron only, which reduces by a factor of two the number of updates with\nrespect to standard spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). This update is\ndependent on the membrane potential of the presynaptic neuron, which is readily\navailable as part of neuron implementation and hence does not require\nadditional memory for storage. Moreover, the update is also regularized on\nsynaptic weight and prevents explosion or vanishing of weights on repeated\nstimulation. Rigorous mathematical analysis is performed to draw an equivalence\nbetween VDSP and STDP. To validate the system-level performance of VDSP, we\ntrain a single-layer spiking neural network (SNN) for the recognition of\nhandwritten digits.

In our approach,\nwe combine classical iterative solvers with convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) to form a preconditioner which is applied within a Krylov solver. For\nthe preconditioner, we use a CNN of type U-Net that operates in conjunction\nwith multigrid ingredients. Two types of preconditioners are proposed 1) U-Net\nas a coarse grid solver, and 2) U-Net as a deflation operator with shifted\nLaplacian V-cycles. Following our training scheme and data-augmentation, our\nCNN preconditioner can generalize over residuals and a relatively general set\nof wave slowness models. On top of that, we also offer an encoder-solver\nframework where an \"encoder\" network generalizes over the medium and sends\ncontext vectors to another \"solver\" network, which generalizes over the\nright-hand-sides. We show that this option is more robust and efficient than\nthe stand-alone variant. Lastly, we also offer a mini-retraining procedure, to\nimprove the solver after the model is known.

Therefore, full\nutilization of available DSP resources for the computationally intensive parts\nof an algorithm is paramount for optimizing the non-functional properties of an\nimplementation (i.e., performance, power, and area). The DSPs available in\nXilinx devices implement large bit width operators (i.e. a 48-bit accumulator\nor a $18 \\times 27$ multiplier). However, using such a DSP for low-precision\nquantized data (as is common in image processing or machine learning\napplications) leaves the DSP resources underutilized. As a remedy, A method has\nbeen proposed to pack and compute four 4-bit multiplications on a single DSP in\na single clock cycle. This paper presents a generalization of this scheme to\narbitrary bit widths and number of multiplications. We also demonstrate that\nthe previously proposed approach leads to errors (Mean Absolute Error (MAE) =\n0.37). Furthermore, we explain where these errors come from and how they can be\ncorrected. On top, we introduce a novel approximate method called \"Overpacking\"\nwhich allows to squeeze even more multiplications into a single DSP at the cost\nof small errors (MAE = 0.47). Overpacking allows to squeeze six 4-bit\nmultiplications into a single DSP compared to just four in the literature.\nFinally, we introduce an alternative method for packing multiple small-bit\nwidth additions into a single 48-bit accumulator for use in applications such\nas Spiking Neural Networks.",

DCGMM instances exhibit a CNN-like layered\nstructure, in which the principal building blocks are convolutional Gaussian\nMixture (cGMM) layers. A key innovation w.r.t. related models like sum-product\nnetworks (SPNs) and probabilistic circuits (PCs) is that each cGMM layer\noptimizes an independent loss function and therefore has an independent\nprobabilistic interpretation. This modular approach permits intervening\ntransformation layers to harness the full spectrum of (potentially\nnon-invertible) mappings available to CNNs, e.g., max-pooling or\nhalf-convolutions. DCGMM sampling and inference are realized by a deep chain of\nhierarchical priors, where a sample generated by a given cGMM layer defines the\nparameters of sampling in the next-lower cGMM layer. For sampling through\nnon-invertible transformation layers, we introduce a new gradient-based\nsharpening technique that exploits redundancy (overlap) in, e.g.,\nhalf-convolutions.

This\nscenario is a good test of the current mathematical model because many modern\nmilitary tactics were employed, in a context where the action took place on\nfoot or horseback, and the historical map and troop numbers are available.\nCompared to a discrete agent model, the flow model was found to better capture\nthe interaction of the forces with the terrain and each other.

Such quality demands, known as\nnon-functional requirements (NFRs), may differ in their definition, scope, and\nimportance from NFRs for traditional systems. Despite the importance of NFRs\nfor ML systems, our understanding of their definitions and scope -- and of the\nextent of existing research in each NFR -- is lacking compared to our\nunderstanding in traditional domains.\nBuilding on an investigation into importance and treatment of ML system NFRs\nin industry, we make three contributions towards narrowing this gap: (1) we\npresent clusters of ML system NFRs based on shared characteristics, (2) we use\nScopus search results -- as well as inter-coder reliability on a sample of NFRs\n-- to estimate the number of relevant studies on a subset of the NFRs, and (3),\nwe use our initial reading of titles and abstracts in each sample to define the\nscope of NFRs over parts of the system (e.g., training data, ML model, or other\nsystem elements). These initial findings form the groundwork for future\nresearch in this emerging domain.",

    "abstract": "Correctly estimating how demand respond to prices is fundamental for airlines\nwilling to optimize their pricing policy. Under some conditions, these\npolicies, while aiming at maximizing short term revenue, can present too little\nprice variation which may decrease the overall quality of future demand\nforecasting. This problem, known as earning while learning problem, is not\nexclusive to airlines, and it has been investigated by academia and industry in\nrecent years. One of the most promising methods presented in literature\ncombines the revenue maximization and the demand model quality into one single\nobjective function. This method has shown great success in simulation studies\nand real life benchmarks. Nevertheless, this work needs to be adapted to\ncertain constraints that arise in the airline revenue management (RM), such as\nthe need to control the prices of several active flights of a leg\nsimultaneously. In this paper, we adjust this method to airline RM while\nassuming unconstrained capacity.

However, due to the existence of camera spectral\nsensitivity, the network trained on a certain sensor, cannot work well on\nothers. Also, since the training datasets are collected in certain\nenvironments, the diversity of illuminants is limited for complex real world\nprediction. In this paper, we tackle these problems via two aspects. First, we\npropose cross-sensor self-supervised training to train the network.

Then, we train the\nnetwork by randomly sampling the artificial illuminants in a sensor-independent\nmanner for scene relighting and supervision. Second, we analyze a previous\ncascaded framework and present a more compact and accurate model by sharing the\nbackbone parameters with learning attention specifically. Experiments show that\nour cross-sensor model and single-sensor model outperform other\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin on cross and single sensor\nevaluations, respectively, with only 16% parameters of the previous best model.",

Changes in the system on\nwhich the ML model has been trained may lead to performance degradation during\nthe system's life cycle. Recent advances that study non-stationary environments\nhave mainly focused on identifying and addressing such changes caused by a\nphenomenon called concept drift. Different terms have been used in the\nliterature to refer to the same type of concept drift and the same term for\nvarious types. This lack of unified terminology is set out to create confusion\non distinguishing between different concept drift variants. In this paper, we\nstart by grouping concept drift types by their mathematical definitions and\nsurvey the different terms used in the literature to build a consolidated\ntaxonomy of the field. We also review and classify performance-based concept\ndrift detection methods proposed in the last decade. These methods utilize the\npredictive model's performance degradation to signal substantial changes in the\nsystems. The classification is outlined in a hierarchical diagram to provide an\norderly navigation between the methods.

It learns visual representations\nby maximizing the similarity between two views of one image with two types of\nconsistency, i.e., pixel consistency and region consistency.

It also extracts a batch\nof region embeddings that correspond to some sub-regions in the overlapped area\nto be contrasted for region consistency. In contrast to previous methods that\nrequire negative pixel pairs, momentum encoders, or heuristic masks, DenseSiam\nbenefits from the simple Siamese network and optimizes the consistency of\ndifferent granularities. It also proves that the simple location correspondence\nand interacted region embeddings are effective enough to learn the similarity.\nWe apply DenseSiam on ImageNet and obtain competitive improvements on various\ndownstream tasks.

The main idea\nof the proposed learning model is to enable blockchain nodes to actively\ncollect data, share the knowledge learned from its data, and then exchange the\nknowledge with other blockchain nodes in the network. In this way, we can not\nonly leverage the knowledge from all the nodes in the network but also do not\nneed to gather all raw data for training at a centralized node like\nconventional centralized learning solutions. Such a framework can also avoid\nthe risk of exposing local data's privacy as well as the excessive network\noverhead/congestion.

To simplify this pipeline\nand unify the process of feature extraction and target information integration,\nwe present a compact tracking framework, termed as {\\em MixFormer}, built upon\ntransformers. Our core design is to utilize the flexibility of attention\noperations, and propose a Mixed Attention Module (MAM) for simultaneous feature\nextraction and target information integration. This synchronous modeling scheme\nallows to extract target-specific discriminative features and perform extensive\ncommunication between target and search area. Based on MAM, we build our\nMixFormer tracking framework simply by stacking multiple MAMs with progressive\npatch embedding and placing a localization head on top. In addition, to handle\nmultiple target templates during online tracking, we devise an asymmetric\nattention scheme in MAM to reduce computational cost, and propose an effective\nscore prediction module to select high-quality templates. Our MixFormer sets a\nnew state-of-the-art performance on five tracking benchmarks, including LaSOT,\nTrackingNet, VOT2020, GOT-10k, and UAV123.

Sharing gameplay videos on social media\nplatforms, such as Reddit, has become a common practice for many players.\nOften, players will share gameplay videos that showcase video game bugs.

Although large repositories of\ngameplay videos exist, parsing and mining them in an effective and structured\nfashion has still remained a big challenge. In this paper, we propose a search\nmethod that accepts any English text query as input to retrieve relevant videos\nfrom large repositories of gameplay videos. Our approach does not rely on any\nexternal information (such as video metadata); it works solely based on the\ncontent of the video.

    "abstract": "To face the programming challenges related to heterogeneous computing, Intel\nrecently introduced oneAPI, a new programming environment that allows code\ndeveloped in Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) language to be run on different devices\nsuch as CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, among others. To tackle CUDA-based legacy codes,\noneAPI provides a compatibility tool (dpct) that facilitates the migration to\nDPC++. Due to the large amount of existing CUDA-based software in the\nbioinformatics context, this paper presents our experiences porting SW#db, a\nwell-known sequence alignment tool, to DPC++ using dpct. From the experimental\nwork, it was possible to prove the usefulness of dpct for SW#db code migration\nand the cross-GPU vendor, cross-architecture portability of the migrated DPC++\ncode. In addition, the performance results showed that the migrated DPC++ code\nreports similar efficiency rates to its CUDA-native counterpart or even better\nin some tests (approximately +5%).",

    "abstract": "Data-driven methods that detect anomalies in times series data are ubiquitous\nin practice, but they are in general unable to provide helpful explanations for\nthe predictions they make. In this work we propose a model-agnostic algorithm\nthat generates counterfactual ensemble explanations for time series anomaly\ndetection models. Our method generates a set of diverse counterfactual\nexamples, i.e, multiple perturbed versions of the original time series that are\nnot considered anomalous by the detection model. Since the magnitude of the\nperturbations is limited, these counterfactuals represent an ensemble of inputs\nsimilar to the original time series that the model would deem normal. Our\nalgorithm is applicable to any differentiable anomaly detection model. We\ninvestigate the value of our method on univariate and multivariate real-world\ndatasets and two deep-learning-based anomaly detection models, under several\nexplainability criteria previously proposed in other data domains such as\nValidity, Plausibility, Closeness and Diversity. We show that our algorithm can\nproduce ensembles of counterfactual examples that satisfy these criteria and\nthanks to a novel type of visualisation, can convey a richer interpretation of\na model's internal mechanism than existing methods. Moreover, we design a\nsparse variant of our method to improve the interpretability of counterfactual\nexplanations for high-dimensional time series anomalies. In this setting, our\nexplanation is localised on only a few dimensions and can therefore be\ncommunicated more efficiently to the model's user.",

Existing methods typically\nemploy the latent space of GANs as the inversion space yet observe the\ninsufficient recovery of spatial details. In this work, we propose to involve\nthe padding space of the generator to complement the latent space with spatial\ninformation. Concretely, we replace the constant padding (e.g., usually zeros)\nused in convolution layers with some instance-aware coefficients. In this way,\nthe inductive bias assumed in the pre-trained model can be appropriately\nadapted to fit each individual image. Through learning a carefully designed\nencoder, we manage to improve the inversion quality both qualitatively and\nquantitatively, outperforming existing alternatives. We then demonstrate that\nsuch a space extension barely affects the native GAN manifold, hence we can\nstill reuse the prior knowledge learned by GANs for various downstream\napplications. Beyond the editing tasks explored in prior arts, our approach\nallows a more flexible image manipulation, such as the separate control of face\ncontour and facial details, and enables a novel editing manner where users can\ncustomize their own manipulations highly efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Over the last two decades, a lot of work has been done in improving network\nsecurity, particularly in intrusion detection systems (IDS) and anomaly\ndetection. Machine learning solutions have also been employed in IDSs to detect\nknown and plausible attacks in incoming traffic. Parameters such as packet\ncontents, sender IP and sender port, connection duration, etc. have been\npreviously used to train these machine learning models to learn to\ndifferentiate genuine traffic from malicious ones. Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs) have been significantly successful in detecting such anomalies,\nmostly attributed to the adversarial training of the generator and\ndiscriminator in an attempt to bypass each other and in turn increase their own\npower and accuracy. However, in large networks having a wide variety of traffic\nat possibly different regions of the network and susceptible to a large number\nof potential attacks, training these GANs for a particular kind of anomaly may\nmake it oblivious to other anomalies and attacks. In addition, the dataset\nrequired to train these models has to be made centrally available and publicly\naccessible, posing the obvious question of privacy of the communications of the\nrespective participants of the network. The solution proposed in this work aims\nat tackling the above two issues by using GANs in a federated architecture in\nnetworks of such scale and capacity. In such a setting, different users of the\nnetwork will be able to train and customize a centrally available adversarial\nmodel according to their own frequently faced conditions. Simultaneously, the\nmember users of the network will also able to gain from the experiences of the\nother users in the network.",

Our key insight is that\nwe can extend graph-search algorithms to the continuous case when used\nsymbiotically with optimization. For the graph search, we introduce\ndiscontinuity-bounded A* (db-A*), a generalization of the A* algorithm that\nuses concepts and data structures from sampling-based planners. Db-A* reuses\nshort trajectories, so-called motion primitives, as edges and allows a maximum\nuser-specified discontinuity at the vertices. These trajectories are locally\nrepaired with trajectory optimization, which also provides new improved motion\nprimitives. Our novel kinodynamic motion planner, kMP-db-A*, has almost surely\nasymptotic optimal behavior and computes near-optimal solutions quickly. For\nour empirical validation, we provide the first benchmark that compares search-,\nsampling-, and optimization-based time-optimal motion planning on multiple\ndynamical systems in different settings.

Among the\nexisting approaches, deep learning models composed of structures for multiscale\nspatiotemporal processing have shown strong potential for encoding facial\ndynamics. However, such models have high computational complexity, making for a\ndifficult deployment of these solutions. To address this issue, we introduce a\nnew technique to decompose the extraction of multiscale spatiotemporal\nfeatures. Particularly, a building block structure called Decomposed Multiscale\nSpatiotemporal Network (DMSN) is presented along with three variants: DMSN-A,\nDMSN-B, and DMSN-C blocks. The DMSN-A block generates multiscale\nrepresentations by analyzing spatiotemporal features at multiple temporal\nranges, while the DMSN-B block analyzes spatiotemporal features at multiple\nranges, and the DMSN-C block analyzes spatiotemporal features at multiple\nspatial sizes. Using these variants, we design our DMSN architecture which has\nthe ability to explore a variety of multiscale spatiotemporal features,\nfavoring the adaptation to different facial behaviors. Our extensive\nexperiments on challenging datasets show that the DMSN-C block is effective for\ndepression detection, whereas the DMSN-A block is efficient for pain\nestimation. Results also indicate that our DMSN architecture provides a\ncost-effective solution for expressions that range from fewer facial variations\nover time, as in depression detection, to greater variations, as in pain\nestimation.",

    "abstract": "Scene flow is a powerful tool for capturing the motion field of 3D point\nclouds. However, it is difficult to directly apply flow-based models to dynamic\npoint cloud classification since the unstructured points make it hard or even\nimpossible to efficiently and effectively trace point-wise correspondences. To\ncapture 3D motions without explicitly tracking correspondences, we propose a\nkinematics-inspired neural network (Kinet) by generalizing the kinematic\nconcept of ST-surfaces to the feature space. By unrolling the normal solver of\nST-surfaces in the feature space, Kinet implicitly encodes feature-level\ndynamics and gains advantages from the use of mature backbones for static point\ncloud processing. With only minor changes in network structures and low\ncomputing overhead, it is painless to jointly train and deploy our framework\nwith a given static model. Experiments on NvGesture, SHREC'17, MSRAction-3D,\nand NTU-RGBD demonstrate its efficacy in performance, efficiency in both the\nnumber of parameters and computational complexity, as well as its versatility\nto various static backbones. Noticeably, Kinet achieves the accuracy of 93.27%\non MSRAction-3D with only 3.20M parameters and 10.35G FLOPS.",

Due to its dynamic nature,\nhowever, JS applications often have a reputation for poor software quality. As\na type-safe superset of JavaScript, TypeScript (TS) offers features to address\nthis. However, there is currently insufficient empirical evidence to broadly\nsupport the claim that TS apps exhibit better software quality than JS apps.\nWe therefore conducted a repository mining study based on 604 GitHub projects\n(299 for JS, 305 for TS) with over 16M LoC and collected four facets of\nsoftware quality: a) code quality (# of code smells per LoC), b) code\nunderstandability (cognitive complexity per LoC), c) bug proneness (bug fix\ncommit ratio), and d) bug resolution time (mean time a bug issue is open). For\nTS, we also collected how frequently the type-safety ignoring `any` type was\nused.\nThe analysis indicates that TS apps exhibit significantly better code quality\nand understandability than JS apps. Contrary to expectations, however, bug\nproneness and bug resolution time of our TS sample were not significantly lower\nthan for JS: mean bug fix commit ratio was more than 60% larger (0.126 vs.\n0.206), and TS projects needed on average more than an additional day to fix\nbugs (31.86 vs. 33.04 days). Furthermore, reducing the usage of the `any` type\nin TS apps was significantly correlated with all metrics except bug proneness\n(Spearman's rho between 0.17 and 0.26).\nOur results indicate that the perceived positive influence of TypeScript for\navoiding bugs in comparison to JavaScript may be more complicated than assumed.\nWhile using TS seems to have benefits, it does not automatically lead to less\nand easier to fix bugs.

    "title": "Visualization Onboarding Grounded in Educational Theories",
    "abstract": "The aim of visualization is to support people in dealing with large and\ncomplex information structures, to make these structures more comprehensible,\nfacilitate exploration, and enable knowledge discovery. However, users often\nhave problems reading and interpreting data from visualizations, in particular\nwhen they experience them for the first time. A lack of visualization literacy,\ni.e., knowledge in terms of domain, data, visual encoding, interaction, and\nalso analytical methods can be observed. To support users in learning how to\nuse new digital technologies, the concept of onboarding has been successfully\napplied in other domains. However, it has not received much attention from the\nvisualization community so far. This chapter aims to fill this gap by defining\nthe concept and systematically laying out the design space of onboarding in the\ncontext of visualization as a descriptive design space. On this basis, we\npresent a survey of approaches from the academic community as well as from\ncommercial products, especially surveying educational theories that inform the\nonboarding strategies. Additionally, we derived design considerations based on\nprevious publications and present some guidelines for the design of\nvisualization onboarding concepts.",

    "title": "Work-From-Home is Here to Stay: Call for Flexibility in Post-Pandemic  Work Policies",
    "abstract": "In early 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic forced employees in tech companies\nworldwide to abruptly transition from working in offices to working from their\nhomes. During two years of predominantly working from home, employees and\nmanagers alike formed expectations about what post-pandemic working life should\nlook like. Many companies are currently experimenting with new work policies\nthat balance both employee- and manager expectations to where, when and how\nwork should be done in the future. In this article, we gather experiences from\n17 companies and their sites, covering 12 countries. We share the results of\ncorporate surveys of employee preferences for working from home and analyse new\nwork policies. Our results are threefold. First, through the new work policies\nall companies are formally giving more flexibility to the employees with\nregards to working time and work location. Second, there is a great variation\nin how much flexibility the companies are willing to yield to the employees.\nThe variation is related both to industry type, size of the companies, and\ncompany culture. Third, we document a change in the psychological contract\nbetween employees and managers, where the option of working from home is\nconverted from an exclusive perk that managers could choose to give to the few,\nto a core privilege that all employees feel they are entitled to. Finally,\nthere are indications that as the companies learn and solicit feedback\nregarding the efficiency of the chosen strategies, we might see further\ndevelopments and changes of the work policies with respect to how much\nflexibility to work whenever and from anywhere they grant. Through these\nfindings, the paper contributes to a growing literature about the new trends\nemerging from the pandemic in tech companies and spells out practical\nimplications onwards.",

    "abstract": "A Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) characterizes how a human ear\nreceives sounds from a point in space, and depends on the shapes of one's head,\npinna, and torso. Accurate estimations of HRTFs for human subjects are crucial\nin enabling binaural acoustic applications such as sound localization and 3D\nsound spatialization. Unfortunately, conventional approaches for HRTF\nestimation rely on specialized devices or lengthy measurement processes. This\nwork proposes a novel lightweight method for HRTF individualization that can be\nimplemented using commercial-off-the-shelf components and performed by average\nusers in home settings. The proposed method has two key components: a\ngenerative neural network model that can be individualized to predict HRTFs of\nnew subjects from sparse measurements, and a lightweight measurement procedure\nthat collects HRTF data from spatial locations. Extensive experiments using a\npublic dataset and in house measurement data from 10 subjects of different ages\nand genders, show that the individualized models significantly outperform a\nbaseline model in the accuracy of predicted HRTFs. To further demonstrate the\nadvantages of individualized HRTFs, we implement two prototype applications for\nbinaural localization and acoustic spatialization. We find that the performance\nof a localization model is improved by 15 degree after trained with\nindividualized HRTFs. Furthermore, in hearing tests, the success rate of\ncorrectly identifying the azimuth direction of incoming sounds increases by\n183% after individualization.",

    "title": "Not All Points Are Equal: Learning Highly Efficient Point-based  Detectors for 3D LiDAR Point Clouds",
    "abstract": "We study the problem of efficient object detection of 3D LiDAR point clouds.\nTo reduce the memory and computational cost, existing point-based pipelines\nusually adopt task-agnostic random sampling or farthest point sampling to\nprogressively downsample input point clouds, despite the fact that not all\npoints are equally important to the task of object detection. In particular,\nthe foreground points are inherently more important than background points for\nobject detectors. Motivated by this, we propose a highly-efficient single-stage\npoint-based 3D detector in this paper, termed IA-SSD. The key of our approach\nis to exploit two learnable, task-oriented, instance-aware downsampling\nstrategies to hierarchically select the foreground points belonging to objects\nof interest. Additionally, we also introduce a contextual centroid perception\nmodule to further estimate precise instance centers. Finally, we build our\nIA-SSD following the encoder-only architecture for efficiency. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on several large-scale detection benchmarks demonstrate\nthe competitive performance of our IA-SSD. Thanks to the low memory footprint\nand a high degree of parallelism, it achieves a superior speed of 80+\nframes-per-second on the KITTI dataset with a single RTX2080Ti GPU.

    "title": "Can we integrate spatial verification methods into neural-network loss  functions for atmospheric science?",
    "abstract": "In the last decade, much work in atmospheric science has focused on spatial\nverification (SV) methods for gridded prediction, which overcome serious\ndisadvantages of pixelwise verification. However, neural networks (NN) in\natmospheric science are almost always trained to optimize pixelwise loss\nfunctions, even when ultimately assessed with SV methods. This establishes a\ndisconnect between model verification during vs. after training. To address\nthis issue, we develop spatially enhanced loss functions (SELF) and demonstrate\ntheir use for a real-world problem: predicting the occurrence of thunderstorms\n(henceforth, \"convection\") with NNs. In each SELF we use either a neighbourhood\nfilter, which highlights convection at scales larger than a threshold, or a\nspectral filter (employing Fourier or wavelet decomposition), which is more\nflexible and highlights convection at scales between two thresholds. We use\nthese filters to spatially enhance common verification scores, such as the\nBrier score. We train each NN with a different SELF and compare their\nperformance at many scales of convection, from discrete storm cells to tropical\ncyclones. Among our many findings are that (a) for a low (high) risk threshold,\nthe ideal SELF focuses on small (large) scales; (b) models trained with a\npixelwise loss function perform surprisingly well; (c) however, models trained\nwith a spectral filter produce better-calibrated probabilities than a pixelwise\nmodel. We provide a general guide to using SELFs, including technical\nchallenges and the final Python code, as well as demonstrating their use for\nthe convection problem. To our knowledge this is the most in-depth guide to\nSELFs in the geosciences.",

Recently researchers have found\nthat such limitations can be partially addressed by stochastic unrolling with\nsubsets of operators, inspired by the success of stochastic first-order\noptimization. In this work, we propose a further acceleration upon stochastic\nunrolling, using sketching techniques to approximate products in the\nhigh-dimensional image space.

    "title": "Interpreting Class Conditional GANs with Channel Awareness",
    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanism of generative adversarial networks (GANs) helps\nus better use GANs for downstream applications. Existing efforts mainly target\ninterpreting unconditional models, leaving it less explored how a conditional\nGAN learns to render images regarding various categories. This work fills in\nthis gap by investigating how a class conditional generator unifies the\nsynthesis of multiple classes. For this purpose, we dive into the widely used\nclass-conditional batch normalization (CCBN), and observe that each feature\nchannel is activated at varying degrees given different categorical embeddings.\nTo describe such a phenomenon, we propose channel awareness, which\nquantitatively characterizes how a single channel contributes to the final\nsynthesis. Extensive evaluations and analyses on the BigGAN model pre-trained\non ImageNet reveal that only a subset of channels is primarily responsible for\nthe generation of a particular category, similar categories (e.g., cat and dog)\nusually get related to some same channels, and some channels turn out to share\ninformation across all classes. For good measure, our algorithm enables several\nnovel applications with conditional GANs. Concretely, we achieve (1) versatile\nimage editing via simply altering a single channel and manage to (2)\nharmoniously hybridize two different classes. We further verify that the\nproposed channel awareness shows promising potential in (3) segmenting the\nsynthesized image and (4) evaluating the category-wise synthesis performance.",

    "abstract": "Current deep neural network approaches for camera pose estimation rely on\nscene structure for 3D motion estimation, but this decreases the robustness and\nthereby makes cross-dataset generalization difficult. In contrast, classical\napproaches to structure from motion estimate 3D motion utilizing optical flow\nand then compute depth. Their accuracy, however, depends strongly on the\nquality of the optical flow. To avoid this issue, direct methods have been\nproposed, which separate 3D motion from depth estimation but compute 3D motion\nusing only image gradients in the form of normal flow. In this paper, we\nintroduce a network NFlowNet, for normal flow estimation which is used to\nenforce robust and direct constraints. In particular, normal flow is used to\nestimate relative camera pose based on the cheirality (depth positivity)\nconstraint. We achieve this by formulating the optimization problem as a\ndifferentiable cheirality layer, which allows for end-to-end learning of camera\npose. We perform extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the\nproposed DiffPoseNet's sensitivity to noise and its generalization across\ndatasets.

    "abstract": "Reward-free, unsupervised discovery of skills is an attractive alternative to\nthe bottleneck of hand-designing rewards in environments where task supervision\nis scarce or expensive. However, current skill pre-training methods, like many\nRL techniques, make a fundamental assumption - stationary environments during\ntraining. Traditional methods learn all their skills simultaneously, which\nmakes it difficult for them to both quickly adapt to changes in the\nenvironment, and to not forget earlier skills after such adaptation. On the\nother hand, in an evolving or expanding environment, skill learning must be\nable to adapt fast to new environment situations while not forgetting\npreviously learned skills. These two conditions make it difficult for classic\nskill discovery to do well in an evolving environment. In this work, we propose\na new framework for skill discovery, where skills are learned one after another\nin an incremental fashion. This framework allows newly learned skills to adapt\nto new environment or agent dynamics, while the fixed old skills ensure the\nagent doesn't forget a learned skill. We demonstrate experimentally that in\nboth evolving and static environments, incremental skills significantly\noutperform current state-of-the-art skill discovery methods on both skill\nquality and the ability to solve downstream tasks.

However, mask based pretraining has yet to\nshow benefits for point cloud understanding, likely due to standard backbones\nlike PointNet being unable to properly handle the training versus testing\ndistribution mismatch introduced by masking during training. In this paper, we\nbridge this gap by proposing a discriminative mask pretraining Transformer\nframework, MaskPoint}, for point clouds.

The framework relies on the discontinuous Galerkin spectral element\nmethod (DGSEM) using collocation of quadrature and interpolation points. We\nmodify the integrals over discretization elements where we replace the physical\nfluxes and nonconservative products by two-point numerical fluctuations. The\ncontributions of this work are threefold. First, we analyze the semi-discrete\nDGSEM discretization and prove that the scheme is high-order accurate,\nfree-stream preserving, and entropy stable when excluding material interfaces.\nSecond, we design a three-point scheme with a HLLC solver that does not require\na root-finding algorithm for approximating the nonconservative products. The\nscheme is proved to be robust and entropy stable for convex entropies,\npreserves uniform states across material interfaces, satisfies a discrete\nminimum principle on the specific entropy and maximum principles on the EOS\nparameters. Third, the HLLC solver is applied at interfaces in the DGSEM\nscheme, while we consider two kinds of fluctuations in the integrals over\ndiscretization elements: material interface preserving and entropy\nconservative.

    "abstract": "We study parallel sampling algorithms for classes of distributions defined\nvia determinants: symmetric, nonsymmetric, and partition-constrained\ndeterminantal point processes. For these distributions, counting, a.k.a.\ncomputing the partition function, can be reduced to a simple determinant\ncomputation which is highly parallelizable; Csanky proved it is in NC. However,\nparallel counting does not automatically translate to parallel sampling, as the\nclassic reductions between sampling and counting are inherently sequential.\nDespite this, we show that for all the aforementioned determinant-based\ndistributions, a roughly quadratic parallel speedup over sequential sampling\ncan be achieved. If the distribution is supported on subsets of size $k$ of a\nground set, we show how to approximately produce a sample in\n$\\widetilde{O}(k^{\\frac{1}{2} + c})$ time with polynomially many processors for\nany $c>0$. In the special case of symmetric determinantal point processes, our\nbound improves to $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt k)$ and we show how to sample exactly in\nthis case.\nWe obtain our results via a generic sampling-to-counting reduction that uses\napproximate rejection sampling. As our main technical contribution, we show\nthat whenever a distribution satisfies a certain form of high-dimensional\nexpansion called entropic independence, approximate rejection sampling can\nachieve a roughly quadratic speedup in sampling via counting. Various forms of\nhigh-dimensional expansion, including the notion of entropic independence we\nuse in this work, have been the source of major breakthroughs in sampling\nalgorithms in recent years; thus we expect our framework to prove useful in the\nfuture for distributions beyond those defined by determinants.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation is an important task in computer vision that is often\ntackled with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A CNN learns to produce\npixel-level predictions through training on pairs of images and their\ncorresponding ground-truth segmentation labels. For segmentation tasks with\nmultiple classes, the standard approach is to use a network that computes a\nmulti-channel probabilistic segmentation map, with each channel representing\none class. In applications where the image grid size (e.g., when it is a 3D\nvolume) and/or the number of labels is relatively large, the standard\n(baseline) approach can become prohibitively expensive for our computational\nresources. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to address\nthis challenge. In our approach, the segmentation network produces a\nsingle-channel output, while being conditioned on a single class label, which\ndetermines the output class of the network. Our method, called label\nconditioned segmentation (LCS), can be used to segment images with a very large\nnumber of classes, which might be infeasible for the baseline approach. We also\ndemonstrate in the experiments that label conditioning can improve the accuracy\nof a given backbone architecture, likely, thanks to its parameter efficiency.\nFinally, as we show in our results, an LCS model can produce previously unseen\nfine-grained labels during inference time, when only coarse labels were\navailable during training.

    "abstract": "Recently, medical report generation, which aims to automatically generate a\nlong and coherent descriptive paragraph of a given medical image, has received\ngrowing research interests. Different from the general image captioning tasks,\nmedical report generation is more challenging for data-driven neural models.\nThis is mainly due to 1) the serious data bias: the normal visual regions\ndominate the dataset over the abnormal visual regions, and 2) the very long\nsequence. To alleviate above two problems, we propose an AlignTransformer\nframework, which includes the Align Hierarchical Attention (AHA) and the\nMulti-Grained Transformer (MGT) modules: 1) AHA module first predicts the\ndisease tags from the input image and then learns the multi-grained visual\nfeatures by hierarchically aligning the visual regions and disease tags. The\nacquired disease-grounded visual features can better represent the abnormal\nregions of the input image, which could alleviate data bias problem; 2) MGT\nmodule effectively uses the multi-grained features and Transformer framework to\ngenerate the long medical report. The experiments on the public IU-Xray and\nMIMIC-CXR datasets show that the AlignTransformer can achieve results\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art methods on the two datasets.

    "abstract": "A deep learning model is presented to nowcast the occurrence of lightning at\na five-minute time resolution 60 minutes into the future. The model is based on\na recurrent-convolutional architecture that allows it to recognize and predict\nthe spatiotemporal development of convection, including the motion, growth and\ndecay of thunderstorm cells. The predictions are performed on a stationary\ngrid, without the use of storm object detection and tracking. The input data,\ncollected from an area in and surrounding Switzerland, comprise ground-based\nradar data, visible/infrared satellite data and derived cloud products,\nlightning detection, numerical weather prediction and digital elevation model\ndata. We analyze different alternative loss functions, class weighting\nstrategies and model features, providing guidelines for future studies to\nselect loss functions optimally and to properly calibrate the probabilistic\npredictions of their model. Based on these analyses, we use focal loss in this\nstudy, but conclude that it only provides a small benefit over cross entropy,\nwhich is a viable option if recalibration of the model is not practical.",

    "abstract": "\"What-if\" questions are intuitively generated during the design process.\nEngineers and architects need to inherently conduct design decisions,\nprogressing from one phase to another. They either use empirical domain\nexperience, simulations, or data-driven methods to conduct consequential\nfeedback. We take an example in an interdisciplinary domain, energy-efficient\nbuilding design scenario, to argue that the current methods for decision\nsupport have four limitations: 1. Less carefully inspected parametric\nindependence raise risks of biased results and spurious relationships. 2. The\nintegration gap between data-driven methods and knowledge-based approaches. 3.\nLess explicit model interpretability for informed decision-making. 4. Ambiguous\nboundaries for machine assistance during the design process. In this paper, we\nfirst clarify the nature of dynamic personal experience and constant principal\nknowledge in design. Sequentially, we introduce the causal inference into the\nenergy-efficient design domain by proposing a two-step process to reveal and\nanalyze the parametric dependencies within the design space by identifying the\ndesign causal diagram with interventions. The causal diagram provides a nexus\nfor integrating domain knowledge with data-driven methods and allows for\ninterpretability and testability against domain experience. The extraction of\ncausal structures from the data is close to the common design reasoning\nprocess. As an illustration, we applied the properties of the proposed\nestimators through simulations. The paper is concluded with a feasibility study\nthat demonstrates the realization of the proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of mechanism design for two-stage repeated stochastic\ngames -- a novel setting using which many emerging problems in next-generation\nelectricity markets can be readily modeled. Repeated playing affords the\nplayers a large class of strategies that adapt a player's actions to all past\nobservations and inferences obtained therefrom. In other settings such as\niterative auctions or dynamic games where a large strategy space of this sort\nmanifests, it typically has an important implication for mechanism design: It\nmay be impossible to obtain truth-telling as a dominant strategy equilibrium.\nConsequently, in such scenarios, it is common to settle for mechanisms that\nrender truth-telling only a Nash equilibrium, or variants thereof, even though\nNash equilibria are known to be poor models of real-world behavior owing to\neach player having to make overly specific assumptions about the behaviors of\nthe other players in order for them to employ their Nash equilibrium strategy.\nIn general, the lesser the burden of speculation in an equilibrium, the more\nplausible it is that it models real-world behavior. Guided by this maxim, we\nintroduce a new notion of equilibrium called Dominant Strategy Non-Bankrupting\nEquilibrium (DNBE) which requires the players to make very little assumptions\nabout the behavior of the other players to employ their equilibrium strategy.\nConsequently, a mechanism that renders truth-telling a DNBE as opposed to only\na Nash equilibrium could be quite effective in molding real-world behavior\nalong the desired lines. Finally, we present a mechanism for two-stage repeated\nstochastic games that renders truth-telling a Dominant Strategy Non-Bankrupting\nEquilibrium.

    "abstract": "This work presents a method of efficiently computing inner and outer\napproximations of forward reachable sets for nonlinear control systems with\nchanged dynamics and diminished control authority, given an a priori computed\nreachable set for the nominal system. The method functions by shrinking or\ninflating a precomputed reachable set based on prior knowledge of the system's\ntrajectory deviation growth dynamics, depending on whether an inner\napproximation or outer approximation is desired. These dynamics determine an\nupper bound on the minimal deviation between two trajectories emanating from\nthe same point that are generated on the nominal system using nominal control\ninputs, and by the impaired system based on the diminished set of control\ninputs, respectively. The dynamics depend on the given Hausdorff distance bound\nbetween the nominal set of admissible controls and the possibly unknown\nimpaired space of admissible controls, as well as a bound on the rate change\nbetween the nominal and off-nominal dynamics. Because of its computational\nefficiency compared to direct computation of the off-nominal reachable set,\nthis procedure can be applied to on-board fault-tolerant path planning and\nfailure recovery. In addition, the proposed algorithm does not require\nconvexity of the reachable sets unlike our previous work, thereby making it\nsuitable for general use.

    "abstract": "We introduce a meshfree collocation framework to model the phase change from\nliquid to vapor at or above the boiling point. While typical vaporization or\nboiling simulations focus on the vaporization from the bulk of the fluid, here\nwe include the possibility of vaporization from the free surface, when a moving\nfluid comes into contact with a superheated surface. We present a continuum,\none-fluid approach in which the liquid and vapor phases are modelled with the\nsame constitutive equations, with different material properties. The novelty\nhere is a monolithic approach without explicit modelling of the interface\nbetween the phases, neither in a sharp nor diffuse sense. Furthermore, no\ninterface boundary conditions or source terms are needed between the liquid and\nvapour phases. Instead, the phase transition is modelled only using material\nproperties varying with temperature. Towards this end, we also present an\nenrichment of strong form meshfree generelized finite difference methods (GFDM)\nto be able to accurately capture derivatives in the presence of jumps in\ndensity, viscosity and other physical properties. The numerical results show\nthe ability of our proposed framework to model phase changes with large jumps.",

    "title": "Quantum Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Variational Quantum  Circuit Design",
    "abstract": "In recent years, quantum computing (QC) has been getting a lot of attention\nfrom industry and academia. Especially, among various QC research topics,\nvariational quantum circuit (VQC) enables quantum deep reinforcement learning\n(QRL). Many studies of QRL have shown that the QRL is superior to the classical\nreinforcement learning (RL) methods under the constraints of the number of\ntraining parameters. This paper extends and demonstrates the QRL to quantum\nmulti-agent RL (QMARL). However, the extension of QRL to QMARL is not\nstraightforward due to the challenge of the noise intermediate-scale quantum\n(NISQ) and the non-stationary properties in classical multi-agent RL (MARL).\nTherefore, this paper proposes the centralized training and decentralized\nexecution (CTDE) QMARL framework by designing novel VQCs for the framework to\ncope with these issues. To corroborate the QMARL framework, this paper conducts\nthe QMARL demonstration in a single-hop environment where edge agents offload\npackets to clouds. The extensive demonstration shows that the proposed QMARL\nframework enhances 57.7% of total reward than classical frameworks.",

    "abstract": "We study a fundamental problem in structure-based drug design -- generating\nmolecules that bind to specific protein binding sites. While we have witnessed\nthe great success of deep generative models in drug design, the existing\nmethods are mostly string-based or graph-based. They are limited by the lack of\nspatial information and thus unable to be applied to structure-based design\ntasks. Particularly, such models have no or little knowledge of how molecules\ninteract with their target proteins exactly in 3D space. In this paper, we\npropose a 3D generative model that generates molecules given a designated 3D\nprotein binding site. Specifically, given a binding site as the 3D context, our\nmodel estimates the probability density of atom's occurrences in 3D space --\npositions that are more likely to have atoms will be assigned higher\nprobability. To generate 3D molecules, we propose an auto-regressive sampling\nscheme -- atoms are sampled sequentially from the learned distribution until\nthere is no room for new atoms. Combined with this sampling scheme, our model\ncan generate valid and diverse molecules, which could be applicable to various\nstructure-based molecular design tasks such as molecule sampling and linker\ndesign. Experimental results demonstrate that molecules sampled from our model\nexhibit high binding affinity to specific targets and good drug properties such\nas drug-likeness even if the model is not explicitly optimized for them.",

    "title": "Information-theoretic analyses of neural data to minimize the effect of  researchers' assumptions in predictive coding studies",
    "abstract": "Studies investigating neural information processing often implicitly ask\nboth, which processing strategy out of several alternatives is used and how\nthis strategy is implemented in neural dynamics. A prime example are studies on\npredictive coding. These often ask if confirmed predictions about inputs or\npredictions errors between internal predictions and inputs are passed on in a\nhierarchical neural system-while at the same time looking for the neural\ncorrelates of coding for errors and predictions. If we do not know exactly what\na neural system predicts at any given moment, this results in a circular\nanalysis-as has been criticized correctly. To circumvent such circular\nanalysis, we propose to express information processing strategies (such as\npredictive coding) by local information-theoretic quantities, such that they\ncan be estimated directly from neural data. We demonstrate our approach by\ninvestigating two opposing accounts of predictive coding-like processing\nstrategies, where we quantify the building blocks of predictive coding, namely\npredictability of inputs and transfer of information, by local active\ninformation storage and local transfer entropy. We define testable hypotheses\non the relationship of both quantities to identify which of the assumed\nstrategies was used. We demonstrate our approach on spiking data from the\nretinogeniculate synapse of the cat. Applying our local information dynamics\nframework, we are able to show that the synapse codes for predictable rather\nthan surprising input. To support our findings, we apply measures from partial\ninformation decomposition, which allow to differentiate if the transferred\ninformation is primarily bottom-up sensory input or information transferred\nconditionally on the current state of the synapse. Supporting our local\ninformation-theoretic results, we find that the synapse preferentially\ntransfers bottom-up information.",

    "abstract": "The intuition suggested by the Drake equation implies that technology should\nbe less prevalent than biology in the galaxy. However, it has been appreciated\nfor decades in the SETI community that technosignatures could be more abundant,\nlonger-lived, more detectable, and less ambiguous than biosignatures. We\ncollect the arguments for and against technosignatures' ubiquity and discuss\nthe implications of some properties of technological life that fundamentally\ndiffer from nontechnological life in the context of modern astrobiology: It can\nspread among the stars to many sites, it can be more easily detected at large\ndistances, and it can produce signs that are unambiguously technological. As an\nillustration in terms of the Drake equation, we consider two Drake-like\nequations, for technosignatures (calculating N(tech)) and biosignatures\n(calculating N(bio)). We argue that Earth and humanity may be poor guides to\nthe longevity term L and that its maximum value could be very large, in that\ntechnology can outlive its creators and even its host star. We conclude that\nwhile the Drake equation implies that N(bio)>>N(tech), it is also plausible\nthat N(tech)>>N(bio). As a consequence, as we seek possible indicators of\nextraterrestrial life, for instance, via characterization of the atmospheres of\nhabitable exoplanets, we should search for both biosignatures and\ntechnosignatures. This exercise also illustrates ways in which biosignature and\ntechnosignature searches can complement and supplement each other and how\nmethods of technosignature search, including old ideas from SETI, can inform\nthe search for biosignatures and life generally.",

    "abstract": "Uplift modeling is a rapidly growing approach that utilizes machine learning\nand causal inference methods to estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects.\nIt has been widely adopted and applied to online marketplaces to assist\nlarge-scale decision-making in recent years. The existing popular methods, like\nforest-based modeling, either work only for discrete treatments or make\npartially linear or parametric assumptions that may suffer from model\nmisspecification. To alleviate these problems, we extend causal forest (CF)\nwith non-parametric dose-response functions (DRFs) that can be estimated\nlocally using a kernel-based doubly robust estimator. Moreover, we propose a\ndistance-based splitting criterion in the functional space of conditional DRFs\nto capture the heterogeneity for the continuous treatments. We call the\nproposed algorithm generalized causal forest (GCF) as it generalizes the use\ncase of CF to a much broader setup. We show the effectiveness of GCF by\ncomparing it to popular uplift modeling models on both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets. We implement GCF in Spark and successfully deploy it into DiDi's\nreal-time pricing system. Online A/B testing results further validate the\nsuperiority of GCF.",

    "title": "Hierarchical autoregressive neural networks for statistical systems",
    "abstract": "It was recently proposed that neural networks could be used to approximate\nmany-dimensional probability distributions that appear e.g. in lattice field\ntheories or statistical mechanics. Subsequently they can be used as variational\napproximators to asses extensive properties of statistical systems, like free\nenergy, and also as neural samplers used in Monte Carlo simulations. The\npractical application of this approach is unfortunately limited by its\nunfavorable scaling both of the numerical cost required for training, and the\nmemory requirements with the system size. This is due to the fact that the\noriginal proposition involved a neural network of width which scaled with the\ntotal number of degrees of freedom, e.g. $L^2$ in case of a two dimensional\n$L\\times L$ lattice. In this work we propose a hierarchical association of\nphysical degrees of freedom, for instance spins, to neurons which replaces it\nwith the scaling with the linear extent $L$ of the system. We demonstrate our\napproach on the two-dimensional Ising model by simulating lattices of various\nsizes up to $128 \\times 128$ spins, with time benchmarks reaching lattices of\nsize $512 \\times 512$. We observe that our proposal improves the quality of\nneural network training, i.e. the approximated probability distribution is\ncloser to the target that could be previously achieved. As a consequence, the\nvariational free energy reaches a value closer to its theoretical expectation\nand, if applied in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, the resulting\nautocorrelation time is smaller. Finally, the replacement of a single neural\nnetwork by a hierarchy of smaller networks considerably reduces the memory\nrequirements.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problems of downlink user selection and power control in\nwireless networks, comprising multiple transmitters and receivers communicating\nwith each other over a shared wireless medium. To achieve a high aggregate\nrate, while ensuring fairness across all the receivers, we formulate a\nresilient radio resource management (RRM) policy optimization problem with\nper-user minimum-capacity constraints that adapt to the underlying network\nconditions via learnable slack variables. We reformulate the problem in the\nLagrangian dual domain, and show that we can parameterize the user selection\nand power control policies using a finite set of parameters, which can be\ntrained alongside the slack and dual variables via an unsupervised primal-dual\napproach thanks to a provably small duality gap. We use a scalable and\npermutation-equivariant graph neural network (GNN) architecture to parameterize\nthe RRM policies based on a graph topology derived from the instantaneous\nchannel conditions. Through experimental results, we verify that the\nminimum-capacity constraints adapt to the underlying network configurations and\nchannel conditions. We further demonstrate that, thanks to such adaptation, our\nproposed method achieves a superior tradeoff between the average rate and the\n5th percentile rate -- a metric that quantifies the level of fairness in the\nresource allocation decisions -- as compared to baseline algorithms.",

This is because commonly\nused mapping methods (e.g., image classification) and suitable data sources\n(i.e., aerial imagery, multi-spectral remote sensing data, LiDAR) have only\nbeen available in recent decades. However, there are alternative data sources\nsuch as cadastral records that are digitally available, containing relevant\ninformation such as building age information, allowing for an approximate,\ndigital reconstruction of past building distributions. We conducted a\nnon-exhaustive search of open and publicly available data resources from\nadministrative institutions in the United States and gathered, integrated, and\nharmonized cadastral parcel data, tax assessment data, and building footprint\ndata for 33 counties, wherever building footprint geometries and building\nconstruction year information was available. The result of this effort is a\nunique dataset which we call the Multi-Temporal Building Footprint Dataset for\n33 U.S. Counties (MTBF-33). MTBF-33 contains over 6.2 million building\nfootprints including their construction year, and can be used to derive\nretrospective depictions of built-up areas from 1900 to 2015, at fine spatial\nand temporal grain and can be used for data validation purposes, or to train\nstatistical learning approaches aiming to extract historical information on\nhuman settlements from remote sensing data, historical maps, or similar data\nsources.

However, modeling and analyzing the hidden\nrelations among stock prices as an important source of information for the\nprediction of their future behavior has not been explored well yet. The\nexisting methods in this domain suffer from the lack of generality and\nflexibility and cannot be easily applied on any set of inter-related stocks.\nThe main challenges in this domain are to find a way for modeling the existing\nrelations among an arbitrary set of stocks and to exploit such a model for\nimproving the prediction performance for those stocks. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel framework, called GCNET that models the relations among an\narbitrary set of stocks as a graph structure called influence network and uses\na set of history-based prediction models to infer plausible initial labels for\na subset of the stock nodes in the graph. Finally, GCNET uses the Graph\nConvolutional Network algorithm to analyzes this partially labeled graph and\npredicts the next price direction of movement for each stock in the graph.\nGCNET is a general prediction framework that can be applied for the prediction\nof the price fluctuations for any set of interacting stocks based on their\nhistorical data.

    "abstract": "Coarse-grained (CG) molecular simulations have become a standard tool to\nstudy molecular processes on time-~and length-scales inaccessible to all-atom\nsimulations. Learning CG force fields from all-atom data has mainly relied on\nforce-matching and relative entropy minimization. Force-matching is\nstraightforward to implement but requires the forces on the CG particles to be\nsaved during all-atom simulation, and because these instantaneous forces depend\non all degrees of freedom, they provide a very noisy signal that makes training\nthe CG force field data inefficient. Relative entropy minimization does not\nrequire forces to be saved and is more data-efficient, but requires the CG\nmodel to be re-simulated during the iterative training procedure, which can\nmake the training procedure extremely costly or lead to failure to converge.\nHere we present \\emph{flow-matching}, a new training method for CG force fields\nthat combines the advantages of force-matching and relative entropy\nminimization by leveraging normalizing flows, a generative deep learning\nmethod. Flow-matching first trains a normalizing flow to represent the CG\nprobability density by using relative entropy minimization without suffering\nfrom the re-simulation problem because flows can directly sample from the\nequilibrium distribution they represent. Subsequently, the forces of the flow\nare used to train a CG force field by matching the coarse-grained forces\ndirectly, which is a much easier problem than traditional force-matching as it\ndoes not suffer from the noise problem. Besides not requiring forces,\nflow-matching also outperforms classical force-matching by an order of\nmagnitude in terms of data efficiency and produces CG models that can capture\nthe folding and unfolding of small proteins.",
