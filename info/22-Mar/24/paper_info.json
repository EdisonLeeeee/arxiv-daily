For\nmeasuring the uncertainty of RPS, the entropy of RPS is presented. However, the\nmaximum entropy principle of RPS entropy has not been discussed. To address\nthis issue, in this paper, the maximum entropy of RPS is presented. The\nanalytical solution for maximum entropy of RPS and its corresponding PMF\ncondition are respectively proofed and discussed. Numerical examples are used\nto illustrate the maximum entropy RPS. The results show that the maximum\nentropy RPS is compatible with the maximum Deng entropy and the maximum Shannon\nentropy. When the order of the element in the permutation event is ignored, the\nmaximum entropy of RPS will degenerate into the maximum Deng entropy. When each\npermutation event is limited to containing just one element, the maximum\nentropy of RPS will degenerate into the maximum Shannon entropy.",

    "abstract": "Recent image inpainting methods have made great progress but often struggle\nto generate plausible image structures when dealing with large holes in complex\nimages. This is partially due to the lack of effective network structures that\ncan capture both the long-range dependency and high-level semantics of an\nimage. To address these problems, we propose cascaded modulation GAN (CM-GAN),\na new network design consisting of an encoder with Fourier convolution blocks\nthat extract multi-scale feature representations from the input image with\nholes and a StyleGAN-like decoder with a novel cascaded global-spatial\nmodulation block at each scale level. In each decoder block, global modulation\nis first applied to perform coarse semantic-aware structure synthesis, then\nspatial modulation is applied on the output of global modulation to further\nadjust the feature map in a spatially adaptive fashion. In addition, we design\nan object-aware training scheme to prevent the network from hallucinating new\nobjects inside holes, fulfilling the needs of object removal tasks in\nreal-world scenarios. Extensive experiments are conducted to show that our\nmethod significantly outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and\nqualitative evaluation.",

    "title": "Bearing-Based Formation Control with Optimal Motion Trajectory",
    "abstract": "Bearing-based distributed formation control is attractive because it can be\nimplemented using vision-based measurements to achieve a desired formation.\nGradient-descent-based controllers using bearing measurements have been shown\nto have many beneficial characteristics, such as global convergence,\napplicability to different graph topologies and workspaces of arbitrary\ndimension, and some flexibility in the choice of the cost. In practice,\nhowever, such controllers typically yield convoluted paths from their initial\nlocation to the final position in the formation. In this paper we propose a\nnovel procedure to optimize gradient-descent-based bearing-based formation\ncontrollers to obtain shorter paths. Our approach is based on the\nparameterization of the cost function and, by extension, of the controller. We\nform and solve a nonlinear optimization problem with the sum of path lengths of\nthe agent trajectories as the objective and subject to the original equilibria\nand global convergence conditions for formation control. Our simulation shows\nthat the parameters can be optimized from a very small number of training\nsamples (1 to 7) to straighten the trajectory by around 16% for a large number\nof random initial conditions for bearing-only formation. However, in the\nabsence of any range information, the scale of the formation is not fixed and\nthis optimization may lead to an undesired compression of the formation size.\nIncluding range measurements avoids this issue and leads to further\ntrajectories straightening by 66%.",

    "abstract": "Middleboxes such as web proxies, firewalls, etc. are widely deployed in\ntoday's network infrastructure. As a result, most protocols need to adapt their\nbehavior to co-exist. One of the most commonly used transport protocols, QUIC,\nadapts to such middleboxes by falling back to TCP, where they block it. In this\npaper, we argue that the blind fallback behavior of QUIC, i.e., not\ndistinguishing between failures caused by middleboxes and that caused by\nnetwork congestion, hugely impacts the performance of QUIC. For this, we focus\non YouTube video streaming and conduct a measurement study by utilizing\nproduction endpoints of YouTube by enabling TCP and QUIC at a time. In total,\nwe collect over 2600 streaming hours of data over various bandwidth patterns,\nfrom 5 different geographical locations and various video genres. To our\nsurprise, we observe that the legacy setup (TCP) either outperforms or performs\nthe same as the QUIC-enabled browser for more than 60% of cases. We see that\nour observation is consistent across individual QoE parameters, bandwidth\npatterns, locations, and videos. Next, we conduct a deep-dive analysis to\ndiscover the root cause behind such behavior. We find a good correlation\n(0.3-0.7) between fallback and QoE drop events, i.e., quality drop and\nre-buffering or stalling. We further perform Granger causal analysis and find\nthat fallback Granger causes either quality drop or stalling for 70% of the\nQUIC-enabled sessions. We believe our study will help designers revisit the\ndecision to enable fallback in QUIC and distinguish between the packet drops\ncaused by middleboxes and network congestion.",

    "abstract": "The Vision Transformer (ViT) model is built on the assumption of treating\nimage patches as \"visual tokens\" and learning patch-to-patch attention. The\npatch embedding based tokenizer is a workaround in practice and has a semantic\ngap with respect to its counterpart, the textual tokenizer. The patch-to-patch\nattention suffers from the quadratic complexity issue, and also makes it\nnon-trivial to explain learned ViT models. To address these issues in ViT\nmodels, this paper proposes to learn patch-to-cluster attention (PaCa) based\nViT models. Queries in our PaCaViT are based on patches, while keys and values\nare based on clustering (with a predefined small number of clusters). The\nclusters are learned end-to-end, leading to better tokenizers and realizing\njoint clustering-for-attention and attention-for-clustering when deployed in\nViT models. The quadratic complexity is relaxed to linear complexity. Also,\ndirectly visualizing the learned clusters can reveal how a trained ViT model\nlearns to perform a task (e.g., object detection). In experiments, the proposed\nPaCa-ViT is tested on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1000 image classification, and\nMS-COCO object detection and instance segmentation. Compared with prior arts,\nit obtains better performance in classification and comparable performance in\ndetection and segmentation. It is significantly more efficient in COCO due to\nthe linear complexity. The learned clusters are also semantically meaningful\nand shed light on designing more discriminative yet interpretable ViT models.",

    "abstract": "The current popular two-stream, two-stage tracking framework extracts the\ntemplate and the search region features separately and then performs relation\nmodeling, thus the extracted features lack the awareness of the target and have\nlimited target-background discriminability. To tackle the above issue, we\npropose a novel one-stream tracking (OSTrack) framework that unifies feature\nlearning and relation modeling by bridging the template-search image pairs with\nbidirectional information flows. In this way, discriminative target-oriented\nfeatures can be dynamically extracted by mutual guidance. Since no extra heavy\nrelation modeling module is needed and the implementation is highly\nparallelized, the proposed tracker runs at a fast speed. To further improve the\ninference efficiency, an in-network candidate early elimination module is\nproposed based on the strong similarity prior calculated in the one-stream\nframework. As a unified framework, OSTrack achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on multiple benchmarks, in particular, it shows impressive results\non the one-shot tracking benchmark GOT-10k, i.e., achieving 73.7% AO, improving\nthe existing best result (SwinTrack) by 4.3%.

Furthermore, using the\nprovided constructions of periodic functions for Farfalle, we show that one can\nmount forgery attacks on the session-supporting mode for authenticated\nencryption (Farfalle-SAE) and the synthetic initial value AE mode\n(Farfalle-SIV). In addition, as the wide block cipher mode Farfalle-WBC is a\n4-round Feistel scheme, a quantum distinguisher is constructed in the case when\ninput branches are containing at last two blocks, where length of one block\ncorresponds to the size of a permutation employed in Farfalle (a similar attack\ncan be mounted to Farfalle-WBC-AE). And finally, we consider the problem of\nextracting a secret round key out of different periods obtained from a\n(Generalized) Feistel scheme (GFN), which has not been addressed in any of the\nprevious works which consider the application of Simon's (or Simon-Grover)\nalgorithm to round reduced versions of GFNs. In this part, we assume that the\nkey is added to an input of an inner function utilized in the round function of\na given GFN. By applying two different interpolation formulas, we show that one\ncan extract the round key by utilizing amount of different periods which is\nclosely related to the polynomial/algebraic degree of underlying inner\nfunction.",

    "abstract": "Many promising applications of supervised machine learning face hurdles in\nthe acquisition of labeled data in sufficient quantity and quality, creating an\nexpensive bottleneck. To overcome such limitations, techniques that do not\ndepend on ground truth labels have been developed, including weak supervision\nand generative modeling. While these techniques would seem to be usable in\nconcert, improving one another, how to build an interface between them is not\nwell-understood. In this work, we propose a model fusing weak supervision and\ngenerative adversarial networks. It captures discrete variables in the data\nalongside the weak supervision derived label estimate. Their alignment allows\nfor better modeling of sample-dependent accuracies of the weak supervision\nsources, improving the unobserved ground truth estimate. It is the first\napproach to enable data augmentation through weakly supervised synthetic images\nand pseudolabels. Additionally, its learned discrete variables can be inspected\nqualitatively. The model outperforms baseline weak supervision label models on\na number of multiclass classification datasets, improves the quality of\ngenerated images, and further improves end-model performance through data\naugmentation with synthetic samples.",

Several prior works have utilized\nside-channel leakage to recover the model architecture while the target is\nexecuting on a hardware acceleration platform. In this work, we target an\nopen-source deep-learning accelerator, Versatile Tensor Accelerator (VTA), and\nutilize electromagnetic (EM) side-channel leakage to comprehensively learn the\nassociation between DNN architecture configurations and EM emanations. We also\nconsider the holistic system -- including the low-level tensor program code of\nthe VTA accelerator on a Xilinx FPGA and explore the effect of such low-level\nconfigurations on the EM leakage. Our study demonstrates that both the\noptimization and configuration of tensor programs will affect the EM\nside-channel leakage.\nGaining knowledge of the association between the low-level tensor program and\nthe EM emanations, we propose NNReArch, a lightweight tensor program scheduling\nframework against side-channel-based DNN model architecture reverse\nengineering. Specifically, NNReArch targets reshaping the EM traces of\ndifferent DNN operators, through scheduling the tensor program execution of the\nDNN model so as to confuse the adversary. NNReArch is a comprehensive\nprotection framework supporting two modes, a balanced mode that strikes a\nbalance between the DNN model confidentiality and execution performance, and a\nsecure mode where the most secure setting is chosen. We implement and evaluate\nthe proposed framework on the open-source VTA with state-of-the-art DNN\narchitectures. The experimental results demonstrate that NNReArch can\nefficiently enhance the model architecture security with a small performance\noverhead. In addition, the proposed obfuscation technique makes reverse\nengineering of the DNN architecture significantly harder.",

In this paper we provide\nnew results and techniques that apply to broader families of games and learning\ndynamics. First, we use a regret-based analysis to show that in a class of\ngames that includes constant-sum polymatrix and strategically zero-sum games,\ndynamics such as \\emph{optimistic mirror descent (OMD)} have \\emph{bounded\nsecond-order path lengths}, a property which holds even when players employ\ndifferent algorithms and prediction mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Reducing the intensity of wind excitation via aerodynamic shape modification\nis a major strategy to mitigate the reaction forces on supertall buildings,\nreduce construction and maintenance costs, and improve the comfort of future\noccupants. To this end, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) combined with\nstate-of-the-art stochastic optimization algorithms is more promising than the\ntrial and error approach adopted by the industry. The present study proposes\nand investigates a novel approach to risk-averse shape optimization of tall\nbuilding structures that incorporates site-specific uncertainties in the wind\nvelocity, terrain conditions, and wind flow direction. A body-fitted finite\nelement approximation is used for the CFD with different wind directions\nincorporated by re-meshing the fluid domain. The bending moment at the base of\nthe building is minimized, resulting in a building with reduced cost, material,\nand hence, a reduced carbon footprint. Both risk-neutral and risk-averse\noptimization of the twist and tapering of a representative building are\npresented under uncertain inflow wind conditions that have been calibrated to\nfit freely-available site-specific data from Basel, Switzerland. The\nrisk-averse strategy uses the conditional value-at-risk to optimize for the\nlow-probability high-consequence events appearing in the worst 10% of loading\nconditions. Adaptive sampling is used to accelerate the gradient-based\nstochastic optimization pipeline. The adaptive method is easy to implement and\nparticularly helpful for compute-intensive simulations because the number of\ngradient samples grows only as the optimal design algorithm converges. The\nperformance of the final risk-averse building geometry is exceptionally\nfavorable when compared to the risk-neutral optimized geometry, thus,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of the risk-averse design approach in\ncomputational wind engineering.",

For a\ndiscrete-time linear system with additive disturbances, we provide a\nconditional value-at-risk reformulation of the MPC optimization problem that is\ndistributionally robust in the expected cost and chance constraints. The\ndistributionally robust chance constraint is over-approximated as a tightened\nchance constraint, wherein the tightening for each time step in the MPC can be\ncomputed offline, hence reducing the computational burden. We conclude with\nnumerical experiments to support our results on the probabilistic guarantees\nand computational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Seed scheduling, the order in which seeds are selected, can greatly affect\nthe performance of a fuzzer. Existing approaches schedule seeds based on their\nhistorical mutation data, but ignore the structure of the underlying Control\nFlow Graph (CFG). Examining the CFG can help seed scheduling by revealing the\npotential edge coverage gain from mutating a seed.\nAn ideal strategy will schedule seeds based on a count of all reachable and\nfeasible edges from a seed through mutations, but computing feasibility along\nall edges is prohibitively expensive. Therefore, a seed scheduling strategy\nmust approximate this count. We observe that an approximate count should have 3\nproperties -- (i) it should increase if there are more edges reachable from a\nseed; (ii) it should decrease if mutation history information suggests an edge\nis hard to reach or is located far away from currently visited edges; and (iii)\nit should be efficient to compute over large CFGs.\nWe observe that centrality measures from graph analysis naturally provide\nthese three properties and therefore can efficiently approximate the likelihood\nof reaching unvisited edges by mutating a seed. We therefore build a graph\ncalled the edge horizon graph that connects seeds to their closest unvisited\nnodes and compute the seed node's centrality to measure the potential edge\ncoverage gain from mutating a seed.\nWe implement our approach in K-scheduler and compare with many popular seed\nscheduling strategies. We find that K-scheduler increases feature coverage by\n25.89% compared to Entropic and edge coverage by 4.21% compared to the\nnext-best AFL-based seed scheduler, in arithmetic mean on 12 Google FuzzBench\nprograms. It also finds 3 more previously-unknown bugs than the next-best\nAFL-based seed scheduler.",

Most previous learning-based\nplane reconstruction methods reconstruct 3D planes from single images, which\nhighly rely on single-view regression and suffer from depth scale ambiguity. In\ncontrast, we reconstruct 3D planes with a multi-view-stereo (MVS) pipeline that\ntakes advantage of multi-view geometry. We decouple plane reconstruction into a\nsemantic plane detection branch and a plane MVS branch. The semantic plane\ndetection branch is based on a single-view plane detection framework but with\ndifferences.

Extensive experiments on various indoor datasets show\nthat PlaneMVS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-view\nplane reconstruction methods on both plane detection and 3D geometry metrics.\nOur method even outperforms a set of SOTA learning-based MVS methods thanks to\nthe learned plane priors.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in a wide\nrange of computer vision tasks, with the state-of-the-art results obtained\nthrough complex and deep structures that require intensive computation and\nmemory. Now-a-days, efficient model inference is crucial for consumer\napplications on resource-constrained platforms. As a result, there is much\ninterest in the research and development of dedicated deep learning (DL)\nhardware to improve the throughput and energy efficiency of DNNs. Low-precision\nrepresentation of DNN data-structures through quantization would bring great\nbenefits to specialized DL hardware. However, the rigorous quantization leads\nto a severe accuracy drop. As such, quantization opens a large hyper-parameter\nspace at bit-precision levels, the exploration of which is a major challenge.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel framework referred to as the Fixed-Point\nQuantizer of deep neural Networks (FxP-QNet) that flexibly designs a mixed\nlow-precision DNN for integer-arithmetic-only deployment. Specifically, the\nFxP-QNet gradually adapts the quantization level for each data-structure of\neach layer based on the trade-off between the network accuracy and the\nlow-precision requirements. Additionally, it employs post-training\nself-distillation and network prediction error statistics to optimize the\nquantization of floating-point values into fixed-point numbers. Examining\nFxP-QNet on state-of-the-art architectures and the benchmark ImageNet dataset,\nwe empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of FxP-QNet in achieving the\naccuracy-compression trade-off without the need for training. The results show\nthat FxP-QNet-quantized AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet-18 reduce the overall\nmemory requirements of their full-precision counterparts by 7.16x, 10.36x, and\n6.44x with less than 0.95%, 0.95%, and 1.99% accuracy drop, respectively.",

    "abstract": "One of the primary mechanisms by which developers receive feedback about\nin-field failures of software from users is through bug reports. Unfortunately,\nthe quality of manually written bug reports can vary widely due to the effort\nrequired to include essential pieces of information, such as detailed\nreproduction steps (S2Rs). Despite the difficulty faced by reporters, few\nexisting bug reporting systems attempt to offer automated assistance to users\nin crafting easily readable, and conveniently reproducible bug reports. To\naddress the need for proactive bug reporting systems that actively aid the user\nin capturing crucial information, we introduce a novel bug reporting approach\ncalled EBug. EBug assists reporters in writing S2Rs for mobile applications by\nanalyzing natural language information entered by reporters in real-time, and\nlinking this data to information extracted via a combination of static and\ndynamic program analyses. As reporters write S2Rs, EBug is capable of\nautomatically suggesting potential future steps using predictive models trained\non realistic app usages. To evaluate EBug, we performed two user studies based\non 20 failures from $11$ real-world apps. The empirical studies involved ten\nparticipants that submitted ten bug reports each and ten developers that\nreproduced the submitted bug reports. In the studies, we found that reporters\nwere able to construct bug reports 31 faster with EBug as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art bug reporting system used as a baseline. EBug's reports were\nalso more reproducible with respect to the ones generated with the baseline.\nFurthermore, we compared EBug's prediction models to other predictive modeling\napproaches and found that, overall, the predictive models of our approach\noutperformed the baseline approaches. Our results are promising and demonstrate\nthe potential benefits provided by proactively assistive bug reporting systems.",

    "abstract": "Putting a watermark into digital circuitry has its own set of challenges.\nCreating a secure watermark in printed matter usually involves including\ngraphics that are difficult to reproduce. In circuitry, including additional\ncircuitry that is hard to produce, one must contend with the prospect of\nincreasing power consumption of the circuit, decreasing the speed of the\ncircuit, and introducing watermark circuitry that is easily reproduced. In this\npaper we present a watermark method for sequential circuitry.

Our method uses an\nencryption technique to introduce secrets about the watermark circuit, at\nseveral levels. It also employs a boundary scan testing protocol as a means to\nprotect the watermark circuitry. Our discussion starts by describing the\ndifferent tools needed in our watermark scheme. We then discuss the difficulty\nof the problem associated with cracking our watermark circuit. This analysis\nshows that, with full implementation, our method can be made quite secure.",

It stands to reason that a further analysis of\nthe detected unknown pixels would be beneficial. Therefore, we propose GOSS,\nwhich unifies the abilities of two well-defined segmentation tasks, OSS and\ngeneric segmentation (GS), in a holistic way. Specifically, GOSS classifies\npixels as belonging to known classes, and clusters (or groups) of pixels of\nunknown class are labelled as such. To evaluate this new expanded task, we\nfurther propose a metric which balances the pixel classification and clustering\naspects. Moreover, we build benchmark tests on top of existing datasets and\npropose a simple neural architecture as a baseline, which jointly predicts\npixel classification and clustering under open-set settings. Our experiments on\nmultiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our baseline. We believe\nour new GOSS task can produce an expressive image understanding for future\nresearch.

    "abstract": "As audio-visual systems are being deployed for safety-critical tasks such as\nsurveillance and malicious content filtering, their robustness remains an\nunder-studied area. Existing published work on robustness either does not scale\nto large-scale dataset, or does not deal with multiple modalities. This work\naims to study several key questions related to multi-modal learning through the\nlens of robustness: 1) Are multi-modal models necessarily more robust than\nuni-modal models? 2) How to efficiently measure the robustness of multi-modal\nlearning? 3) How to fuse different modalities to achieve a more robust\nmulti-modal model? To understand the robustness of the multi-modal model in a\nlarge-scale setting, we propose a density-based metric, and a convexity metric\nto efficiently measure the distribution of each modality in high-dimensional\nlatent space. Our work provides a theoretical intuition together with empirical\nevidence showing how multi-modal fusion affects adversarial robustness through\nthese metrics. We further devise a mix-up strategy based on our metrics to\nimprove the robustness of the trained model. Our experiments on AudioSet and\nKinetics-Sounds verify our hypothesis that multi-modal models are not\nnecessarily more robust than their uni-modal counterparts in the face of\nadversarial examples. We also observe our mix-up trained method could achieve\nas much protection as traditional adversarial training, offering a\ncomputationally cheap alternative.

    "abstract": "The Immersed Boundary (IB) method of Peskin (J. Comput. Phys., 1977) is\nuseful for problems involving fluid-structure interactions or complex\ngeometries. By making use of a regular Cartesian grid that is independent of\nthe geometry, the IB framework yields a robust numerical scheme that can\nefficiently handle immersed deformable structures. Additionally, the IB method\nhas been adapted to problems with prescribed motion and other PDEs with given\nboundary data. IB methods for these problems traditionally involve penalty\nforces which only approximately satisfy boundary conditions, or they are\nformulated as constraint problems. In the latter approach, one must find the\nunknown forces by solving an equation that corresponds to a poorly conditioned\nfirst-kind integral equation. This operation can require a large number of\niterations of a Krylov method, and since a time-dependent problem requires this\nsolve at each time step, this method can be prohibitively inefficient without\npreconditioning. In this work, we introduce a new, well-conditioned IB\nformulation for boundary value problems, which we call the Immersed Boundary\nDouble Layer (IBDL) method. We present the method as it applies to Poisson and\nHelmholtz problems to demonstrate its efficiency over the original constraint\nmethod. In this double layer formulation, the equation for the unknown boundary\ndistribution corresponds to a well-conditioned second-kind integral equation\nthat can be solved efficiently with a small number of iterations of a Krylov\nmethod. Furthermore, the iteration count is independent of both the mesh size\nand immersed boundary point spacing. The method converges away from the\nboundary, and when combined with a local interpolation, it converges in the\nentire PDE domain. Additionally, while the original constraint method applies\nonly to Dirichlet problems, the IBDL formulation can also be used for Neumann\nconditions.",

However, a key component of\nexplainability has been missing: extrapolation, which describes the extent to\nwhich AI models can be clueless when they encounter unfamiliar samples (i.e.,\nsamples outside a convex hull of their training sets, as we will explain down\nbelow). We report that AI models extrapolate outside their range of familiar\ndata, frequently and without notifying the users and stakeholders. Knowing\nwhether a model has extrapolated or not is a fundamental insight that should be\nincluded in explaining AI models in favor of transparency and accountability.\nInstead of dwelling on the negatives, we offer ways to clear the roadblocks in\npromoting AI transparency. Our analysis commentary accompanying practical\nclauses useful to include in AI regulations such as the National AI Initiative\nAct in the US and the AI Act by the European Commission.",

    "abstract": "To model a competitive multi-agent motion planning scenario for heterogeneous\nplayers with distinct dynamics and objectives, we propose a novel atomic\ncongestion game framework with Markov decision process (MDP) dynamics. We\nassume that all players share the state-action space but have unique costs and\ntransition dynamics. Each player's cost is a function of the joint state-action\ndensity, and thus is implicitly coupled to the opponents' policies. With proper\ncost design, the resulting Nash equilibrium avoids congesting the state-action\nspace and each player optimally achieves its individual objective with respect\nto the presence of its opponents. For a class of player cost functions, we\ndemonstrate equivalence between players' Q-value functions and the KKT point of\na potential minimization problem, and derive sufficient conditions for the\nexistence of a unique Nash equilibrium. Finally, we outline a learning\nalgorithm for finding the Nash equilibrium that extends single-agent\nMDP/reinforcement learning algorithms and has linear complexity in the number\nof players. Throughout the paper, we provide examples for multi-agent motion\nplanning, accumulating in a multi-robot warehouse demonstration, in which\nrobots autonomously retrieve and deliver packages while avoiding collisions.",

Testing such systems poses numerous challenges:\nnot only should the system inputs be varied, but also the surrounding\nenvironment should be accounted for. A number of tools have been developed to\ntest the system model for the possible inputs falsifying its requirements.\nHowever, they are not directly applicable to autonomous cyber physical systems,\nas the inputs to their models are generated while operating in a virtual\nenvironment. In this paper, we aim to design a search based framework, named\nAmbieGen, for generating diverse fault revealing test scenarios for autonomous\ncyber physical systems. The scenarios represent an environment in which an\nautonomous agent operates. The framework should be applicable to generating\ndifferent types of environments. To generate the test scenarios, we leverage\nthe NSGA II algorithm with two objectives. The first objective evaluates the\ndeviation of the observed system behaviour from its expected behaviour. The\nsecond objective is the test case diversity, calculated as a Jaccard distance\nwith a reference test case. We evaluate AmbieGen on three scenario generation\ncase studies, namely a smart-thermostat, a robot obstacle avoidance system, and\na vehicle lane keeping assist system. We compared three configurations of\nAmbieGen: based on a single objective genetic algorithm, multi objective, and\nrandom search. Both single and multi objective configurations outperform the\nrandom search. Multi objective configuration can find the individuals of the\nsame quality as the single objective, producing more unique test scenarios in\nthe same time budget.",

    "abstract": "Automatic segmentation of vertebral bodies (VBs) and intervertebral discs\n(IVDs) in 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images is vital in diagnosing and treating\nspinal diseases. However, segmenting the VBs and IVDs simultaneously is not\ntrivial. Moreover, problems exist, including blurry segmentation caused by\nanisotropy resolution, high computational cost, inter-class similarity and\nintra-class variability, and data imbalances. We proposed a two-stage\nalgorithm, named semi-supervised hybrid spine network (SSHSNet), to address\nthese problems by achieving accurate simultaneous VB and IVD segmentation. In\nthe first stage, we constructed a 2D semi-supervised DeepLabv3+ by using cross\npseudo supervision to obtain intra-slice features and coarse segmentation. In\nthe second stage, a 3D full-resolution patch-based DeepLabv3+ was built. This\nmodel can be used to extract inter-slice information and combine the coarse\nsegmentation and intra-slice features provided from the first stage. Moreover,\na cross tri-attention module was applied to compensate for the loss of\ninter-slice and intra-slice information separately generated from 2D and 3D\nnetworks, thereby improving feature representation ability and achieving\nsatisfactory segmentation results. The proposed SSHSNet was validated on a\npublicly available spine MR image dataset, and remarkable segmentation\nperformance was achieved. Moreover, results show that the proposed method has\ngreat potential in dealing with the data imbalance problem. Based on previous\nreports, few studies have incorporated a semi-supervised learning strategy with\na cross attention mechanism for spine segmentation. Therefore, the proposed\nmethod may provide a useful tool for spine segmentation and aid clinically in\nspinal disease diagnoses and treatments.

    "title": "Preconditioned Least-Squares Petrov-Galerkin Reduced Order Models",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a methodology for improving the accuracy and efficiency\nof reduced order models (ROMs) constructed using the least-squares\nPetrov-Galerkin (LSPG) projection method through the introduction of\npreconditioning. Unlike prior related work, which focuses on preconditioning\nthe linear systems arising within the ROM numerical solution procedure to\nimprove linear solver performance, our approach leverages a preconditioning\nmatrix directly within the LSPG minimization problem. Applying preconditioning\nin this way can improve ROM accuracy for several reasons. First,\npreconditioning the LSPG formulation changes the norm defining the residual\nminimization, which can improve the residual-based stability constant bounding\nthe ROM solution's error. The incorporation of a preconditioner into the LSPG\nformulation can have the additional effect of scaling the components of the\nresidual being minimized, which can be beneficial for problems with disparate\nscales. Importantly, we demonstrate that an 'ideal preconditioned' LSPG ROM (a\nROM preconditioned with the inverse of the Jacobian of its corresponding full\norder model, or FOM) emulates projection of the FOM solution increment onto the\nreduced basis, a lower bound on the ROM solution error for a given reduced\nbasis. By designing preconditioners that approximate the Jacobian inverse, a\nROM whose error approaches this lower bound can be obtained. The proposed\napproach is evaluated in the predictive regime on several mechanical and\nthermo-mechanical problems within the Albany HPC code. We demonstrate\nnumerically that the introduction of simple Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel and ILU\npreconditioners into the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition/LSPG formulation\nreduces significantly the ROM solution error, the reduced Jacobian condition\nnumber, the number of nonlinear iterations required to reach convergence, and\nthe wall time.",

    "abstract": "Programming machines with commonsense reasoning (CSR) abilities is a\nlongstanding challenge in the Artificial Intelligence community. Current CSR\nbenchmarks use multiple-choice (and in relatively fewer cases, generative)\nquestion-answering instances to evaluate machine commonsense. Recent progress\nin transformer-based language representation models suggest that considerable\nprogress has been made on existing benchmarks. However, although tens of CSR\nbenchmarks currently exist, and are growing, it is not evident that the full\nsuite of commonsense capabilities have been systematically evaluated.\nFurthermore, there are doubts about whether language models are 'fitting' to a\nbenchmark dataset's training partition by picking up on subtle, but normatively\nirrelevant (at least for CSR), statistical features to achieve good performance\non the testing partition. To address these challenges, we propose a benchmark\ncalled Theoretically-Grounded Commonsense Reasoning (TG-CSR) that is also based\non discriminative question answering, but with questions designed to evaluate\ndiverse aspects of commonsense, such as space, time, and world states. TG-CSR\nis based on a subset of commonsense categories first proposed as a viable\ntheory of commonsense by Gordon and Hobbs. The benchmark is also designed to be\nfew-shot (and in the future, zero-shot), with only a few training and\nvalidation examples provided. This report discusses the structure and\nconstruction of the benchmark. Preliminary results suggest that the benchmark\nis challenging even for advanced language representation models designed for\ndiscriminative CSR question answering tasks.\nBenchmark access and leaderboard:\nhttps://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/3080 Benchmark website:\nhttps://usc-isi-i2.github.io/TGCSR/",

This signal\nmay, often inadvertently, capture sensitive information that can leak semantic\nand geometric properties of the scene which the data owner does not want to\nshare. The goal of this work is to protect sensitive information when learning\nfrom point clouds; by censoring the sensitive information before the point\ncloud is released for downstream tasks. Specifically, we focus on preserving\nutility for perception tasks while mitigating attribute leakage attacks. The\nkey motivating insight is to leverage the localized saliency of perception\ntasks on point clouds to provide good privacy-utility trade-offs. We realize\nthis through a mechanism called Censoring by Noisy Sampling (CBNS), which is\ncomposed of two modules: i) Invariant Sampler: a differentiable point-cloud\nsampler which learns to remove points invariant to utility and ii) Noisy\nDistorter: which learns to distort sampled points to decouple the sensitive\ninformation from utility, and mitigate privacy leakage. We validate the\neffectiveness of CBNS through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art\nbaselines and sensitivity analyses of key design choices.

Factors influencing recurrence and metastasis are currently unknown and\nthere are no distinct histopathological or morphological features indicating\nthe risks of recurrence and metastasis in LSCC. Our study focuses on the\nrecurrence prediction of LSCC based on H&E-stained histopathological\nwhole-slide images (WSI). Due to the small size of LSCC cohorts in terms of\npatients with available recurrence information, standard end-to-end learning\nwith various convolutional neural networks for this task tends to overfit.\nAlso, the predictions made by these models are hard to interpret.\nHistopathology WSIs are typically very large and are therefore processed as a\nset of smaller tiles. In this work, we propose a novel conditional\nself-supervised learning (SSL) method to learn representations of WSI at the\ntile level first, and leverage clustering algorithms to identify the tiles with\nsimilar histopathological representations. The resulting representations and\nclusters from self-supervision are used as features of a survival model for\nrecurrence prediction at the patient level. Using two publicly available\ndatasets from TCGA and CPTAC, we show that our LSCC recurrence prediction\nsurvival model outperforms both LSCC pathological stage-based approach and\nmachine learning baselines such as multiple instance learning.

In this way, the performance impact on the entire LLC is minimised,\nand benign applications can utilise the LLC to its full capacity. We have used\na cycle-accurate simulator (gem5) to analyse the per-formance of the proposed\nmethod and its security effectiveness. It has been successful in abolishing the\ncross-core covert timing channel attack with no significant performance impact\non benign applications. It causes 23% less cache misses in comparison to\nexisting partitioning based solutions while requiring 0.26% storage overhead.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies in deepfake detection have yielded promising results when the\ntraining and testing face forgeries are from the same dataset. However, the\nproblem remains challenging when one tries to generalize the detector to\nforgeries created by unseen methods in the training dataset. This work\naddresses the generalizable deepfake detection from a simple principle: a\ngeneralizable representation should be sensitive to diverse types of forgeries.\nFollowing this principle, we propose to enrich the \"diversity\" of forgeries by\nsynthesizing augmented forgeries with a pool of forgery configurations and\nstrengthen the \"sensitivity\" to the forgeries by enforcing the model to predict\nthe forgery configurations. To effectively explore the large forgery\naugmentation space, we further propose to use the adversarial training strategy\nto dynamically synthesize the most challenging forgeries to the current model.\nThrough extensive experiments, we show that the proposed strategies are\nsurprisingly effective (see Figure 1), and they could achieve superior\nperformance than the current state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Lexically constrained neural machine translation (NMT), which controls the\ngeneration of NMT models with pre-specified constraints, is important in many\npractical scenarios. Due to the representation gap between discrete constraints\nand continuous vectors in NMT models, most existing works choose to construct\nsynthetic data or modify the decoding algorithm to impose lexical constraints,\ntreating the NMT model as a black box. In this work, we propose to open this\nblack box by directly integrating the constraints into NMT models.\nSpecifically, we vectorize source and target constraints into continuous keys\nand values, which can be utilized by the attention modules of NMT models. The\nproposed integration method is based on the assumption that the correspondence\nbetween keys and values in attention modules is naturally suitable for modeling\nconstraint pairs. Experimental results show that our method consistently\noutperforms several representative baselines on four language pairs,\ndemonstrating the superiority of integrating vectorized lexical constraints.",

We refer to this class of\nproblems as human-centric issues. Despite their importance, there is a limited\nunderstanding of the types of human-centric issues that are encountered by\nend-users and taken into account by the developers of mobile apps. In this\npaper, we examine what human-centric issues end-users report through Google App\nStore reviews, which human-centric issues are a topic of discussion for\ndevelopers on GitHub, and whether end-users and developers discuss the same\nhuman-centric issues. We then investigate whether an automated tool might help\ndetect such human-centric issues and whether developers would find such a tool\nuseful. To do this, we conducted an empirical study by extracting and manually\nanalysing a random sample of 1,200 app reviews and 1,200 issue comments from 12\ndiverse projects that exist on both Google App Store and GitHub. Our analysis\nled to a taxonomy of human-centric issues that categorises human-centric issues\ninto three-high levels: App Usage, Inclusiveness, and User Reaction. We then\ndeveloped machine learning and deep learning models that are promising in\nautomatically identifying and classifying human-centric issues from app reviews\nand developer discussions.

    "abstract": "Generating paired sequences with maximal compatibility from a given set is\none of the most important challenges in various applications, including\ninformation and communication technologies. However, the number of possible\npairings explodes in a double factorial order as a function of the number of\nentities, manifesting the difficulties of finding the optimal pairing that\nmaximizes the overall reward. In the meantime, in real-world systems, such as\nuser pairing in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), pairing often needs to\nbe conducted at high speed in dynamically changing environments; hence,\nefficient recognition of the environment and finding high reward pairings are\nhighly demanded. In this paper, we demonstrate an efficient pairing algorithm\nto recognize compatibilities among elements as well as to find a pairing that\nyields a high total compatibility. The proposed pairing strategy consists of\ntwo phases. The first is the observation phase, where compatibility information\namong elements is obtained by only observing the sum of rewards. We show an\nefficient strategy that allows obtaining all compatibility information with\nminimal observations. The minimum number of observations under these conditions\nis also discussed, along with its mathematical proof. The second is the\ncombination phase, by which a pairing with a large total reward is determined\nheuristically. We transform the pairing problem into a traveling salesman\nproblem (TSP) in a three-layer graph structure, which we call Pairing-TSP. We\ndemonstrate heuristic algorithms in solving the Pairing-TSP efficiently. This\nresearch is expected to be utilized in real-world applications such as NOMA,\nsocial networks, among others.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable success in several\ncomputer vision tasks. The progresses are highly relevant to the architecture\ndesign, then it is worthwhile to propose Transformer Architecture Search (TAS)\nto search for better ViTs automatically. However, current TAS methods are\ntime-consuming and existing zero-cost proxies in CNN do not generalize well to\nthe ViT search space according to our experimental observations. In this paper,\nfor the first time, we investigate how to conduct TAS in a training-free manner\nand devise an effective training-free TAS (TF-TAS) scheme. Firstly, we observe\nthat the properties of multi-head self-attention (MSA) and multi-layer\nperceptron (MLP) in ViTs are quite different and that the synaptic diversity of\nMSA affects the performance notably. Secondly, based on the observation, we\ndevise a modular strategy in TF-TAS that evaluates and ranks ViT architectures\nfrom two theoretical perspectives: synaptic diversity and synaptic saliency,\ntermed as DSS-indicator. With DSS-indicator, evaluation results are strongly\ncorrelated with the test accuracies of ViT models. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our TF-TAS achieves a competitive performance against the\nstate-of-the-art manually or automatically design ViT architectures, and it\npromotes the searching efficiency in ViT search space greatly: from about $24$\nGPU days to less than $0.5$ GPU days.

Recently, it has been observed that the\nbest uni-modal network outperforms the jointly trained multi-modal network,\nwhich is counter-intuitive since multiple signals generally bring more\ninformation. This work provides a theoretical explanation for the emergence of\nsuch performance gap in neural networks for the prevalent joint training\nframework. Based on a simplified data distribution that captures the realistic\nproperty of multi-modal data, we prove that for the multi-modal late-fusion\nnetwork with (smoothed) ReLU activation trained jointly by gradient descent,\ndifferent modalities will compete with each other. The encoder networks will\nlearn only a subset of modalities. We refer to this phenomenon as modality\ncompetition.

To fully explore the benefits offered\nby the HR-RIS, we first formulate the joint design of the transmit power and\nrelay/reflection coefficients of the HR-RIS as an optimization problem to\nmaximize the covert rate subject to a covertness constraint. To tackle the\nsolution to this optimization problem, we then derive a closed-form expression\nfor an upper bound on covert rate, based on which we develop an alternate\nalgorithm to solve the formulated optimization problem. Our examination shows\nthat the HR-RIS outperforms the traditional RIS in term of achieving a higher\ncovert rate.

    "abstract": "Few-shot object detection (FSOD), which aims at learning a generic detector\nthat can adapt to unseen tasks with scarce training samples, has witnessed\nconsistent improvement recently. However, most existing methods ignore the\nefficiency issues, e.g., high computational complexity and slow adaptation\nspeed. Notably, efficiency has become an increasingly important evaluation\nmetric for few-shot techniques due to an emerging trend toward embedded AI. To\nthis end, we present an efficient pretrain-transfer framework (PTF) baseline\nwith no computational increment, which achieves comparable results with\nprevious state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Upon this baseline, we devise an\ninitializer named knowledge inheritance (KI) to reliably initialize the novel\nweights for the box classifier, which effectively facilitates the knowledge\ntransfer process and boosts the adaptation speed. Within the KI initializer, we\npropose an adaptive length re-scaling (ALR) strategy to alleviate the vector\nlength inconsistency between the predicted novel weights and the pretrained\nbase weights. Finally, our approach not only achieves the SOTA results across\nthree public benchmarks, i.e., PASCAL VOC, COCO and LVIS, but also exhibits\nhigh efficiency with 1.8-9.0x faster adaptation speed against the other methods\non COCO/LVIS benchmark during few-shot transfer.

The important features of the TV-IMCC lie in:\n1) it is of an asymptotical stability for irregular contour tracking compared\nto the cross coupled control (CCC); 2) it does not lead to system nonlinearity\nand hence is well-suited for tracking multi-axis contours compared to the task\ncoordinate frame (TCF) control; 3) it reduces the tracking error and extends\nthe class of contours can be tracked compared to the position domain control\n(PDC). Furthermore, the stability analysis of the closed-loop system with the\nproposed TV-IMCC methodology is provided.

A major potential of the proposed TV-IMCC is in the field of\nmulti-axis ultra-precision contour tracking.

    "abstract": "Fingerprints are popular among the biometric based systems due to ease of\nacquisition, uniqueness and availability. Nowadays it is used in smart phone\nsecurity, digital payment and digital locker. The traditional fingerprint\nmatching methods based on minutiae are mainly applicable for large-area\nfingerprint and the accuracy rate would reduce significantly when dealing with\nsmall-area fingerprint from smart phone. There are many attempts to using deep\nlearning for small-area fingerprint recognition, and there are many successes.\nBut training deep neural network needs a lot of datasets for training. There is\nno well-known dataset for small-area, so we have to make datasets ourselves. In\nthis paper, we propose a method of data augmentation to train a small-area\nfingerprint recognition deep neural network with a normal fingerprint database\n(such as FVC2002) and verify it via tests. The experimental results showed the\nefficiency of our method.",

    "abstract": "Recent Semi-Supervised Object Detection (SS-OD) methods are mainly based on\nself-training, i.e., generating hard pseudo-labels by a teacher model on\nunlabeled data as supervisory signals. Although they achieved certain success,\nthe limited labeled data in semi-supervised learning scales up the challenges\nof object detection. We analyze the challenges these methods meet with the\nempirical experiment results. We find that the massive False Negative samples\nand inferior localization precision lack consideration. Besides, the large\nvariance of object sizes and class imbalance (i.e., the extreme ratio between\nbackground and object) hinder the performance of prior arts. Further, we\novercome these challenges by introducing a novel approach, Scale-Equivalent\nDistillation (SED), which is a simple yet effective end-to-end knowledge\ndistillation framework robust to large object size variance and class\nimbalance. SED has several appealing benefits compared to the previous works.\n(1) SED imposes a consistency regularization to handle the large scale variance\nproblem. (2) SED alleviates the noise problem from the False Negative samples\nand inferior localization precision. (3) A re-weighting strategy can implicitly\nscreen the potential foreground regions of the unlabeled data to reduce the\neffect of class imbalance. Extensive experiments show that SED consistently\noutperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods on different datasets with\nsignificant margins. For example, it surpasses the supervised counterpart by\nmore than 10 mAP when using 5% and 10% labeled data on MS-COCO.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Ev-TTA, a simple, effective test-time adaptation algorithm for\nevent-based object recognition. While event cameras are proposed to provide\nmeasurements of scenes with fast motions or drastic illumination changes, many\nexisting event-based recognition algorithms suffer from performance\ndeterioration under extreme conditions due to significant domain shifts. Ev-TTA\nmitigates the severe domain gaps by fine-tuning the pre-trained classifiers\nduring the test phase using loss functions inspired by the spatio-temporal\ncharacteristics of events. Since the event data is a temporal stream of\nmeasurements, our loss function enforces similar predictions for adjacent\nevents to quickly adapt to the changed environment online. Also, we utilize the\nspatial correlations between two polarities of events to handle noise under\nextreme illumination, where different polarities of events exhibit distinctive\nnoise distributions. Ev-TTA demonstrates a large amount of performance gain on\na wide range of event-based object recognition tasks without extensive\nadditional training. Our formulation can be successfully applied regardless of\ninput representations and further extended into regression tasks.

    "title": "Distort to Detect, not Affect: Detecting Stealthy Sensor Attacks with  Micro-distortion",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an effective and easily deployable approach to\ndetect the presence of stealthy sensor attacks in industrial control systems,\nwhere (legacy) control devices critically rely on accurate (and usually\nnon-encrypted) sensor readings. Specifically, we focus on stealthy attacks that\ncrash a sensor and then immediately impersonate that sensor by sending out fake\nreadings. We consider attackers who aim to stay hidden in the system for a\nprolonged period. To detect such attacks, our approach relies on continuous\ninjection of \"micro distortion\" to the original sensor's readings. In\nparticular, the injected distortion should be kept strictly within a small\nmagnitude (e.g., $0.5\\%$ of the possible operating value range), to ensure it\ndoes not affect the normal functioning of the ICS. Our approach uses a\npre-shared secret sequence between a sensor and the defender to generate the\nmicro-distortions. One key challenge is that the micro-distortions injected are\noften much lower than the sensor's actual readings, hence can be easily\noverwhelmed by the latter. To overcome this, we leverage the observation that\nsensor readings in many ICS (and power grid in particular) often change\ngradually in a significant fraction of time (i.e., with small difference\nbetween consecutive time slots). We devise a simple yet effective algorithm\nthat can detect stealthy attackers in a highly accurate and fast (i.e., using\nless than 100 samples) manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our defense\nusing real-world sensor reading traces from two different smart grid systems.",

Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that\nwe can efficiently verify fully general symmetry breaking in Boolean\nsatisfiability (SAT) solving, thus providing, for the first time, a unified\nmethod to certify a range of advanced SAT techniques that also includes XOR and\ncardinality reasoning.

    "abstract": "Sparse Transformer has recently attracted a lot of attention since the\nability for reducing the quadratic dependency on the sequence length. We argue\nthat two factors, information bottleneck sensitivity and inconsistency between\ndifferent attention topologies, could affect the performance of the Sparse\nTransformer. This paper proposes a well-designed model named ERNIE-Sparse. It\nconsists of two distinctive parts: (i) Hierarchical Sparse Transformer (HST) to\nsequentially unify local and global information. (ii) Self-Attention\nRegularization (SAR) method, a novel regularization designed to minimize the\ndistance for transformers with different attention topologies. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of ERNIE-Sparse, we perform extensive evaluations. Firstly, we\nperform experiments on a multi-modal long sequence modeling task benchmark,\nLong Range Arena (LRA). Experimental results demonstrate that ERNIE-Sparse\nsignificantly outperforms a variety of strong baseline methods including the\ndense attention and other efficient sparse attention methods and achieves\nimprovements by 2.77% (57.78% vs. 55.01%). Secondly, to further show the\neffectiveness of our method, we pretrain ERNIE-Sparse and verified it on 3 text\nclassification and 2 QA downstream tasks, achieve improvements on\nclassification benchmark by 0.83% (92.46% vs. 91.63%), on QA benchmark by 3.24%\n(74.67% vs. 71.43%).

The\nwell-known federated learning approach is able to utilize such architectures by\nallowing the exchange of only parameters with the server, while keeping the\ndatasets private to each contributing device. In this work, we propose a fully\ndistributed, diffusion-based learning algorithm that does not require a central\nserver and propose an adaptive combination rule for the cooperation of the\ndevices. By adopting a classification task on the MNIST dataset, the efficacy\nof the proposed algorithm over corresponding counterparts is demonstrated via\nthe reduction of the number of collaboration rounds required to achieve an\nacceptable accuracy level in non- IID dataset scenarios.",

    "abstract": "In federated learning (FL), clients may have diverse objectives, merging all\nclients' knowledge into one global model will cause negative transfers to local\nperformance. Thus, clustered FL is proposed to group similar clients into\nclusters and maintain several global models. Nevertheless, current clustered FL\nalgorithms require the assumption of the number of clusters, they are not\neffective enough to explore the latent relationships among clients. However, we\ntake advantage of peer-to-peer (P2P) FL, where clients communicate with\nneighbors without a central server and propose an algorithm that enables\nclients to form an effective communication topology in a decentralized manner\nwithout assuming the number of clusters. Additionally, the P2P setting will\nrelease the concerns caused by the central server in centralized FL, such as\nreliability and communication bandwidth problems. In our method, 1) we present\ntwo novel metrics for measuring client similarity, applicable under P2P\nprotocols; 2) we devise a two-stage algorithm, in the first stage, an efficient\nmethod to enable clients to match same-cluster neighbors with high confidence\nis proposed; 3) then in the second stage, a heuristic method based on\nExpectation Maximization under the Gaussian Mixture Model assumption of\nsimilarities is used for clients to discover more neighbors with similar\nobjectives.

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-enabled communication is a promising solution\nfor secure air-to-ground (A2G) networks due to the additional secure degrees of\nfreedom afforded by mobility. However, the jittering characteristics caused by\nthe random airflow and the body vibration of the UAV itself have a\nnon-negligible impact on the performance of UAV communication. Considering the\nimpact of UAV jittering, this paper propose a robust and secure transmission\ndesign assisted by an novel active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS),where\nthe reflecting elements in IRS not only adjust the phase shift but also amplify\nthe amplitude of signals. Specifically, under the worst-case secrecy rate\nconstraints, we aim to minimize the transmission power by the robust joint\ndesign of active IRS's reflecting coefficient and beamforming at the UAV-borne\nbase station (UBS). However,it is challenging to solve the joint optimization\nproblem due to its non-convexity. To tackle this problem, the non-convex\nproblem is reformulated with linear approximation for the channel variations\nand linear matrix inequality transformed by S-procedure and Schur's complement.\nThen, we decouple this problem into two sub-problems, namely, passive\nbeamforming and active IRS's reflecting coefficient optimization, and solve\nthem through alternate optimization (AO). Finally, the numerical results\ndemonstrate the potential of active IRS on power saving under secure\ntransmission constraints and the impact of UAV jittering.",

Specifically, we\ndesign and train an RNN to learn the correlation in the time-varying channel\nand predict the channel coefficients into the future with good accuracy over a\nwide range of Dopplers and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The proposed training\nmethodology enables accurate channel prediction through the use of techniques\nsuch as teacher-force training, early-stop, and reduction of learning rate on\nplateau. Also, the robustness of prediction for different Dopplers and SNRs is\nachieved by adapting the number of predictions into the future based on the\nDoppler and SNR. Numerical results show that good bit error performance is\nachieved by the proposed receiver in time-varying fading channels. We also\npropose a data decision driven receiver architecture using RNNs that further\nreduces the pilot overhead while maintaining good bit error performance.",

    "abstract": "Recent High Dynamic Range (HDR) techniques extend the capabilities of current\ncameras where scenes with a wide range of illumination can not be accurately\ncaptured with a single low-dynamic-range (LDR) image. This is generally\naccomplished by capturing several LDR images with varying exposure values whose\ninformation is then incorporated into a merged HDR image. While such approaches\nwork well for static scenes, dynamic scenes pose several challenges, mostly\nrelated to the difficulty of finding reliable pixel correspondences.\nData-driven approaches tackle the problem by learning an end-to-end mapping\nwith paired LDR-HDR training data, but in practice generating such HDR\nground-truth labels for dynamic scenes is time-consuming and requires complex\nprocedures that assume control of certain dynamic elements of the scene (e.g.\nactor pose) and repeatable lighting conditions (stop-motion capturing). In this\nwork, we propose a novel self-supervised approach for learnable HDR estimation\nthat alleviates the need for HDR ground-truth labels. We propose to leverage\nthe internal statistics of LDR images to create HDR pseudo-labels. We\nseparately exploit static and well-exposed parts of the input images, which in\nconjunction with synthetic illumination clipping and motion augmentation\nprovide high quality training examples. Experimental results show that the HDR\nmodels trained using our proposed self-supervision approach achieve performance\ncompetitive with those trained under full supervision, and are to a large\nextent superior to previous methods that equally do not require any\nsupervision.",

Researchers argue that AI should be more\ntransparent to increase trust, making transparency one of the main goals of\nXAI. Nevertheless, empirical research on this topic is inconclusive regarding\nthe effect of transparency on trust. An explanation for this ambiguity could be\nthat trust is operationalized differently within XAI. In this position paper,\nwe advocate for a clear distinction between behavioral (objective) measures of\nreliance and attitudinal (subjective) measures of trust. However, researchers\nsometimes appear to use behavioral measures when intending to capture trust,\nalthough attitudinal measures would be more appropriate. Based on past\nresearch, we emphasize that there are sound theoretical reasons to keep trust\nand reliance separate. Properly distinguishing these two concepts provides a\nmore comprehensive understanding of how transparency affects trust and\nreliance, benefiting future XAI research.",

However, due to the lack of\neffective AF methods for the recently introduced event cameras, their FC still\nrelies on naive AF like manual focus adjustments, leading to poor adaptation in\nchallenging real-world conditions. In particular, the inherent differences\nbetween event and frame data in terms of sensing modality, noise, temporal\nresolutions, etc., bring many challenges in designing an effective AF method\nfor event cameras. To address these challenges, we develop a novel event-based\nautofocus framework consisting of an event-specific focus measure called event\nrate (ER) and a robust search strategy called event-based golden search (EGS).\nTo verify the performance of our method, we have collected an event-based\nautofocus dataset (EAD) containing well-synchronized frames, events, and focal\npositions in a wide variety of challenging scenes with severe lighting and\nmotion conditions.

In this paper, we learn an Adaptive Confidence Margin (Ada-CM)\nto fully leverage all unlabeled data for semi-supervised deep facial expression\nrecognition. All unlabeled samples are partitioned into two subsets by\ncomparing their confidence scores with the adaptively learned confidence margin\nat each training epoch: (1) subset I including samples whose confidence scores\nare no lower than the margin; (2) subset II including samples whose confidence\nscores are lower than the margin. For samples in subset I, we constrain their\npredictions to match pseudo labels. Meanwhile, samples in subset II participate\nin the feature-level contrastive objective to learn effective facial expression\nfeatures. We extensively evaluate Ada-CM on four challenging datasets, showing\nthat our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially surpassing\nfully-supervised baselines in a semi-supervised manner.

    "abstract": "Conceptual models visually represent entities and relationships between them\nin an information system. Effective conceptual models should be simple while\ncommunicating sufficient information. This trade-off between model complexity\nand clarity is crucial to prevent failure of information system development.\nPast studies have found that more expressive models lead to higher performance\non tasks measuring a user s deep understanding of the model and attributed this\nto lower experience of cognitive workload associated with these models. This\nstudy examined this hypothesis by measuring users EEG brain activity while they\ncompleted a task with different conceptual models. 30 participants were divided\ninto two groups: One group used a low ontologically expressive model (LOEM),\nand the other group used a high ontologically expressive model (HOEM).\nCognitive workload during the task was quantified using EEG Engagement Index,\nwhich is a ratio of brain activity power in beta as opposed to the sum of alpha\nand theta frequency bands. No significant difference in cognitive workload was\nfound between the LOEM and HOEM groups indicating equal amounts of cognitive\nprocessing required for understanding of both models. The main contribution of\nthis study is the introduction of neurophysiological measures as an objective\nquantification of cognitive workload in the field of conceptual modeling and\ninformation systems.",

Although these batteries no longer meet the demands of their first\napplication, many still have a significant portion of their initial capacity\nremaining for use in secondary applications. Yet, direct repurposing is\ngenerally not possible and each cell in a battery must be evaluated, increasing\nthe cost of the repurposed packs due to the time intensive screening process.\nIn this paper, a rapid assessment of the internal resistance of a cell is\nproposed. First, this method of measuring the resistance is completed on cells\nfrom twelve retired battery packs and one fresh pack using a hybrid pulse power\ncharacterization (HPPC) test as a benchmark for the analysis. Results from\nthese tests show relatively constant resistance measurements across mid to high\nterminal voltages, allowing this metric to be independent of state of charge\n(SOC). Then, the relation between internal resistance and capacity across the\nvarious packs is discussed. Initial experimental results from this study show a\ncorrelation between internal resistance and capacity which can be approximated\nwith a linear fit, suggesting internal resistance measurements taken above a\nthreshold cell terminal voltage may be a suitable initial screening metric for\nthe capacity of retired cells without knowledge of the SOC.",

    "abstract": "A MasterFace is a face image that can successfully match against a large\nportion of the population. Since their generation does not require access to\nthe information of the enrolled subjects, MasterFace attacks represent a\npotential security risk for widely-used face recognition systems. Previous\nworks proposed methods for generating such images and demonstrated that these\nattacks can strongly compromise face recognition. However, previous works\nfollowed evaluation settings consisting of older recognition models, limited\ncross-dataset and cross-model evaluations, and the use of low-scale testing\ndata. This makes it hard to state the generalizability of these attacks. In\nthis work, we comprehensively analyse the generalizability of MasterFace\nattacks in empirical and theoretical investigations. The empirical\ninvestigations include the use of six state-of-the-art FR models, cross-dataset\nand cross-model evaluation protocols, and utilizing testing datasets of\nsignificantly higher size and variance. The results indicate a low\ngeneralizability when MasterFaces are training on a different face recognition\nmodel than the one used for testing. In these cases, the attack performance is\nsimilar to zero-effort imposter attacks. In the theoretical investigations, we\ndefine and estimate the face capacity and the maximum MasterFace coverage under\nthe assumption that identities in the face space are well separated. The\ncurrent trend of increasing the fairness and generalizability in face\nrecognition indicates that the vulnerability of future systems might further\ndecrease. We conclude that MasterFaces should not be seen as a threat to face\nrecognition systems but, on the contrary, seen as a tool to understand and\nenhance the robustness of face recognition models.",

Grasps are evaluated by simulating the deformations during grasping\nand predicting the contacts between the gripper and the grasped object. The\ncontact information is then used as input for a new grasp quality metric to\nquantify the grasp quality. The approach is benchmarked against two classical\nrigid-body quality metrics on over 600 grasps in the Isaac gym simulation and\nover 50 real-world grasps.

The attention encoded vector is\nderived using a weighted sum of the feature map and the attention scores later.\nFinally, the sigmoid function is used at the output layer to make the\nprediction suitable for multi-label AUs detection. We achieved a macro F1 score\nof 0.48 on the ABAW challenge validation set compared to 0.39 from the baseline\nmodel.",

    "abstract": "An emerging computational paradigm, named federated edge learning (FEL),\nenables intelligent computing at the network edge with the feature of\npreserving data privacy for edge devices. Given their constrained resources, it\nbecomes a great challenge to achieve high execution performance for FEL. Most\nof the state-of-the-arts concentrate on enhancing FEL from the perspective of\nsystem operation procedures, taking few precautions during the composition step\nof the FEL system. Though a few recent studies recognize the importance of FEL\nformation and propose server-centric device selection schemes, the impact of\ndata sizes is largely overlooked. In this paper, we take advantage of game\ntheory to depict the decision dilemma among edge devices regarding whether to\nparticipate in FEL or not given their heterogeneous sizes of local datasets.\nFor realizing both the individual and global optimization, the server is\nemployed to solve the participation dilemma, which requires accurate\ninformation collection for devices' local datasets. Hence, we utilize mechanism\ndesign to enable truthful information solicitation. With the help of correlated\nequilibrium, we derive a decision making strategy for devices from the global\nperspective, which can achieve the long-term stability and efficacy of FEL. For\nscalability consideration, we optimize the computational complexity of the\nbasic solution to the polynomial level. Lastly, extensive experiments based on\nboth real and synthetic data are conducted to evaluate our proposed mechanisms,\nwith experimental results demonstrating the performance advantages.",

    "abstract": "Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) is a sensing paradigm that has transformed the way\nthat various service providers collect, process, and analyze data. MCS offers\nnovel processes where data is sensed and shared through mobile devices of the\nusers to support various applications and services for cutting-edge\ntechnologies. However, various threats, such as data poisoning, clogging task\nattacks and fake sensing tasks adversely affect the performance of MCS systems,\nespecially their sensing, and computational capacities. Since fake sensing task\nsubmissions aim at the successful completion of the legitimate tasks and mobile\ndevice resources, they also drain MCS platform resources. In this work, Self\nOrganizing Feature Map (SOFM), an artificial neural network that is trained in\nan unsupervised manner, is utilized to pre-cluster the legitimate data in the\ndataset, thus fake tasks can be detected more effectively through less\nimbalanced data where legitimate/fake tasks ratio is lower in the new dataset.\nAfter pre-clustered legitimate tasks are separated from the original dataset,\nthe remaining dataset is used to train a Deep Neural Network (DeepNN) to reach\nthe ultimate performance goal. Pre-clustered legitimate tasks are appended to\nthe positive prediction outputs of DeepNN to boost the performance of the\nproposed technique, which we refer to as pre-clustered DeepNN (PrecDeepNN). The\nresults prove that the initial average accuracy to discriminate the legitimate\nand fake tasks obtained from DeepNN with the selected set of features can be\nimproved up to an average accuracy of 0.9812 obtained from the proposed machine\nlearning technique.",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) compute in an event-based matter to achieve a\nmore efficient computation than standard Neural Networks. In SNNs, neuronal\noutputs (i.e. activations) are not encoded with real-valued activations but\nwith sequences of binary spikes. The motivation of using SNNs over conventional\nneural networks is rooted in the special computational aspects of SNNs,\nespecially the very high degree of sparsity of neural output activations. Well\nestablished architectures for conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\nfeature large spatial arrays of Processing Elements (PEs) that remain highly\nunderutilized in the face of activation sparsity. We propose a novel\narchitecture that is optimized for the processing of Convolutional SNNs (CSNNs)\nthat feature a high degree of activation sparsity. In our architecture, the\nmain strategy is to use less but highly utilized PEs. The PE array used to\nperform the convolution is only as large as the kernel size, allowing all PEs\nto be active as long as there are spikes to process. This constant flow of\nspikes is ensured by compressing the feature maps (i.e. the activations) into\nqueues that can then be processed spike by spike. This compression is performed\nin run-time using dedicated circuitry, leading to a self-timed scheduling. This\nallows the processing time to scale directly with the number of spikes. A novel\nmemory organization scheme called memory interlacing is used to efficiently\nstore and retrieve the membrane potentials of the individual neurons using\nmultiple small parallel on-chip RAMs. Each RAM is hardwired to its PE, reducing\nswitching circuitry and allowing RAMs to be located in close proximity to the\nrespective PE. We implemented the proposed architecture on an FPGA and achieved\na significant speedup compared to other implementations while needing less\nhardware resources and maintaining a lower energy consumption.",

    "abstract": "The success of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) benefits from high\nvolumes of annotated data. However, annotating medical images is laborious,\nexpensive, and requires human expertise, which induces the label scarcity\nproblem. Especially when encountering the domain shift, the problem becomes\nmore serious. Although deep unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) can leverage\nwell-established source domain annotations and abundant target domain data to\nfacilitate cross-modality image segmentation and also mitigate the label\npaucity problem on the target domain, the conventional UDA methods suffer from\nsevere performance degradation when source domain annotations are scarce. In\nthis paper, we explore a challenging UDA setting - limited source domain\nannotations. We aim to investigate how to efficiently leverage unlabeled data\nfrom the source and target domains with limited source annotations for\ncross-modality image segmentation. To achieve this, we propose a new\nlabel-efficient UDA framework, termed MT-UDA, in which the student model\ntrained with limited source labels learns from unlabeled data of both domains\nby two teacher models respectively in a semi-supervised manner. More\nspecifically, the student model not only distills the intra-domain semantic\nknowledge by encouraging prediction consistency but also exploits the\ninter-domain anatomical information by enforcing structural consistency.\nConsequently, the student model can effectively integrate the underlying\nknowledge beneath available data resources to mitigate the impact of source\nlabel scarcity and yield improved cross-modality segmentation performance. We\nevaluate our method on MM-WHS 2017 dataset and demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin under the\nsource-label scarcity scenario.",

Our system model provides for the\npossibility that the encoder and decoder have shared randomness, as is the case\nin systems using dithered quantizers.

In this paper, we showcase how the planning\nlandscapes of SASs can be quantified and reasoned, particularly with respect to\nthe different environments. By studying four diverse real-world SASs and 14\nenvironments, we found that (1) the SAS planning landscapes often provide\nstrong guidance to the planner, but their ruggedness and multi-modality can be\nthe major obstacle; (2) the extents of guidance and number of global/local\noptima are sensitive to the changing environment, but not the ruggedness of the\nsurface; (3) the local optima are often closer to the global optimum than other\nrandom points; and (4) there are considerable (and useful) overlaps on the\nglobal/local optima between landscapes under different environments.

The\nrecent development of tomographic image reconstruction on sparse-view\nmeasurements employs deep neural networks in a supervised way to tackle such\nissues, whereas the success of model training requires quantity and quality of\nthe given paired measurements/images. We propose a novel untrained Transformer\nto fit the CBCT inverse solver without training data. It is mainly comprised of\nan untrained 3D Transformer of billions of network weights and a multi-level\nloss function with variable weights. Unlike conventional deep neural networks\n(DNNs), there is no requirement of training steps in our approach. Upon\nobserving the hardship of optimising Transformer, the variable weights within\nthe loss function are designed to automatically update together with the\niteration process, ultimately stabilising its optimisation. We evaluate the\nproposed approach on two publicly available datasets: SPARE and Walnut. The\nresults show a significant performance improvement on image quality metrics\nwith streak artefact reduction in the visualisation. We also provide a clinical\nreport by an experienced radiologist to assess our reconstructed images in a\ndiagnosis point of view. The source code and the optimised models are available\nfrom the corresponding author on request at the moment.",

    "abstract": "While deep learning-based image reconstruction methods have shown significant\nsuccess in removing objects from pictures, they have yet to achieve acceptable\nresults for attributing consistency to gender, ethnicity, expression, and other\ncharacteristics like the topological structure of the face. The purpose of this\nwork is to extract the mask region from a masked image and rebuild the area\nthat has been detected. This problem is complex because (i) it is difficult to\ndetermine the gender of an image hidden behind a mask, which causes the network\nto become confused and reconstruct the male face as a female or vice versa;\n(ii) we may receive images from multiple angles, making it extremely difficult\nto maintain the actual shape, topological structure of the face and a natural\nimage; and (iii) there are problems with various mask forms because, in some\ncases, the area of the mask cannot be anticipated precisely; certain parts of\nthe mask remain on the face after completion. To solve this complex task, we\nsplit the problem into three phases: landmark detection, object detection for\nthe targeted mask area, and inpainting the addressed mask region. To begin, to\nsolve the first problem, we have used gender classification, which detects the\nactual gender behind a mask, then we detect the landmark of the masked facial\nimage. Second, we identified the non-face item, i.e., the mask, and used the\nMask R-CNN network to create the binary mask of the observed mask area.\nThirdly, we developed an inpainting network that uses anticipated landmarks to\ncreate realistic images. To segment the mask, this article uses a mask R-CNN\nand offers a binary segmentation map for identifying the mask area.\nAdditionally, we generated the image utilizing landmarks as structural guidance\nthrough a GAN-based network. The studies presented in this paper use the FFHQ\nand CelebA datasets.",

In this\ncontext, we present a geometric view of the energy harvesting mechanism, from a\nstochastic control perspective, that entails a forced periodic trajectory of\nthe system state on the thermodynamic manifold.

    "abstract": "To accomplish the punctuation restoration task, most existing approaches\nfocused on leveraging extra information (e.g., part-of-speech tags) or\naddressing the class imbalance problem. Recent works have widely applied the\ntransformer-based language models and significantly improved their\neffectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, an inherent issue has remained\nneglected: the attention of individual heads in the transformer will be diluted\nor powerless while feeding the long non-punctuation utterances. Since those\nprevious contexts, not the followings, are comparatively more valuable to the\ncurrent position, it's hard to achieve a good balance by independent attention.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Feature Fusion framework based on two-type\nAttentions (FFA) to alleviate the shortage. It introduces a two-stream\narchitecture. One module involves interaction between attention heads to\nencourage the communication, and another masked attention module captures the\ndependent feature representation. Then, it aggregates two feature embeddings to\nfuse information and enhances context-awareness. The experiments on the popular\nbenchmark dataset IWSLT demonstrate that our approach is effective.

In this paper, we propose a normal refinement\nnetwork, called Refine-Net, to predict accurate normals for noisy point clouds.\nTraditional normal estimation wisdom heavily depends on priors such as surface\nshapes or noise distributions, while learning-based solutions settle for single\ntypes of hand-crafted features.

Also, Refine-Net is a generic normal\nestimation framework: 1) point normals obtained from other methods can be\nfurther refined, and 2) any feature module related to the surface geometric\nstructures can be potentially integrated into the framework.

The scheduling of jobs must respect\nseveral constraints concerning eligibility and availability of ovens, release\ndates of jobs, setup times between batches as well as oven capacities. Running\nthe ovens is highly energy-intensive and thus the main objective, besides\nfinishing jobs on time, is to minimize the cumulative batch processing time\nacross all ovens.

However, there are\ncurrently few explorations in the graph-based SSL literature on exploiting\nclassical dimensionality reduction techniques for improved label propagation.\nIn this work, we investigate the use of dimensionality reduction techniques\nsuch as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP to see their effect on the performance of graph\nneural networks (GNNs) designed for semi-supervised propagation of node labels.\nOur study makes use of benchmark semi-supervised GDL datasets such as the Cora\nand Citeseer datasets to allow meaningful comparisons of the representations\nlearned by each algorithm when paired with a dimensionality reduction\ntechnique. Our comprehensive benchmarks and clustering visualizations\nquantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that, under certain conditions,\nemploying a priori and a posteriori dimensionality reduction to GNN inputs and\noutputs, respectively, can simultaneously improve the effectiveness of\nsemi-supervised node label propagation and node clustering.

When the order on strings is the co-lexicographic one\n\\emph{and} this order turns out to be total, the DFA is called Wheeler. This\nrecently introduced class of automata -- the \\emph{Wheeler automata} --\nconstitute an important data-structure for languages, since it allows the\ndesign and implementation of a very efficient tool-set of storage mechanisms\nfor the transition function, supporting a large variety of substring queries.\nIn this context it is natural to consider the class of regular languages\naccepted by Wheeler automata, i.e. the Wheeler languages. An inspiring result\nin this area is the following: it has been shown that, as opposed to the\ngeneral case, the classic determinization by powerset construction is\n\\emph{polynomial} on Wheeler automata. As a consequence, most classical\nproblems, when considered on this class of automata, turn out to be \"easy\" --\nthat is, solvable in polynomial time.\nIn this paper we consider computational problems related to Wheelerness, but\nstarting from non-deterministic automata. We also consider the case of\n\\emph{reduced} non-deterministic ones -- a class of NFA where recognizing\nWheelerness is still polynomial, as for DFA's. Our collection of results shows\nthat moving towards non-determinism is, in most cases, a dangerous path leading\nquickly to intractability.\nMoreover, we start a study of \"state complexity\" related to Wheeler DFA and\nlanguages, proving that the classic construction for the intersection of\nlanguages turns out to be computationally simpler on Wheeler DFA than in the\ngeneral case. We also provide a construction for the minimum Wheeler DFA\nrecognizing a given Wheeler language.",

A broad range of previous research has explored how to use attention\nmodules to localize detailed facial parts (e,g. facial action units), learn\ndiscriminative features, and learn inter-class correlation. However, few\nrelated works pay attention to the robustness of the attention module itself.\nThrough experiments, we found neural attention maps initialized with different\nfeature maps yield diverse representations when learning to attend the\nidentical Region of Interest (ROI). In other words, similar to general feature\nlearning, the representational quality of attention maps also greatly affects\nthe performance of a model, which means unconstrained attention learning has\nlots of randomnesses. This uncertainty lets conventional attention learning\nfall into sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose a compact model to enhance the\nrepresentational and focusing power of neural attention maps and learn the\n\"inter-attention\" correlation for refined attention maps, which we term the\n\"Self-Diversified Multi-Channel Attention Network (SMA-Net)\".

    "abstract": "Photorealistic rendering and reposing of humans is important for enabling\naugmented reality experiences. We propose a novel framework to reconstruct the\nhuman and the scene that can be rendered with novel human poses and views from\njust a single in-the-wild video. Given a video captured by a moving camera, we\ntrain two NeRF models: a human NeRF model and a scene NeRF model. To train\nthese models, we rely on existing methods to estimate the rough geometry of the\nhuman and the scene. Those rough geometry estimates allow us to create a\nwarping field from the observation space to the canonical pose-independent\nspace, where we train the human model in. Our method is able to learn subject\nspecific details, including cloth wrinkles and accessories, from just a 10\nseconds video clip, and to provide high quality renderings of the human under\nnovel poses, from novel views, together with the background.",

    "abstract": "Cascading bandits model the task of learning to rank $K$ out of $L$ items\nover $n$ rounds of partial feedback. For this model, the minimax (i.e.,\ngap-free) regret is poorly understood; in particular, the best known lower and\nupper bounds are $\\Omega(\\sqrt{nL/K})$ and $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{nLK})$,\nrespectively. We improve the lower bound to $\\Omega(\\sqrt{nL})$ and show\nCascadeKL-UCB (which ranks items by their KL-UCB indices) attains it up to log\nterms. Surprisingly, we also show CascadeUCB1 (which ranks via UCB1) can suffer\nsuboptimal $\\Omega(\\sqrt{nLK})$ regret. This sharply contrasts with standard\n$L$-armed bandits, where the corresponding algorithms both achieve the minimax\nregret $\\sqrt{nL}$ (up to log terms), and the main advantage of KL-UCB is only\nto improve constants in the gap-dependent bounds. In essence, this contrast\noccurs because Pinsker's inequality is tight for hard problems in the $L$-armed\ncase but loose (by a factor of $K$) in the cascading case.",

Many recent studies have devised various machine learning as\nwell as deep learning architectures for sleep staging. However, two key\nchallenges hinder the practical use of these architectures: effectively\ncapturing salient waveforms in sleep signals and correctly classifying\nconfusing stages in transitioning epochs. In this study, we propose a novel\ndeep neural network structure, TransSleep, that captures distinctive local\ntemporal patterns and distinguishes confusing stages using two auxiliary tasks.\nIn particular, TransSleep adopts an attention-based multi-scale feature\nextractor module to capture salient waveforms; a stage-confusion estimator\nmodule with a novel auxiliary task, epoch-level stage classification, to\nestimate confidence scores for identifying confusing stages; and a context\nencoder module with the other novel auxiliary task, stage-transition detection,\nto represent contextual relationships across neighboring epochs. Results show\nthat TransSleep achieves promising performance in automatic sleep staging. The\nvalidity of TransSleep is demonstrated by its state-of-the-art performance on\ntwo publicly available datasets, Sleep-EDF and MASS. Furthermore, we performed\nablations to analyze our results from different perspectives.

ZOOMER is designed for tackling two challenges presented by\nthe massive user data at Taobao: low training/serving efficiency due to the\nhuge scale of the graphs, and low recommendation quality due to the information\noverload which distracts the recommendation model from specific user\nintentions. ZOOMER achieves this by introducing a key concept, Region of\nInterests (ROI) in GNNs for recommendations, i.e., a neighborhood region in the\ngraph with significant relevance to a strong user intention. ZOOMER narrows the\nfocus from the whole graph and \"zooms in\" on the more relevant ROIs, thereby\nreducing the training/serving cost and mitigating the information overload at\nthe same time. With carefully designed mechanisms, ZOOMER identifies the\ninterest expressed by each recommendation request, constructs an ROI subgraph\nby sampling with respect to the interest, and guides the GNN to reweigh\ndifferent parts of the ROI towards the interest by a multi-level attention\nmodule. Deployed as a large-scale distributed system, ZOOMER supports graphs\nwith billions of nodes for training and thousands of requests per second for\nserving.

We\ndevelop and investigate a personalizable deep metric model that captures both\nthe internal contents of items and how they were interacted with by users.\nThere are two key challenges in learning such model. First, there is no\nexplicit similarity annotation, which deviates from the assumption of most\nmetric learning methods. Second, these approaches ignore the fact that items\nare often represented by multiple sources of meta data and different users use\ndifferent combinations of these sources to form their own notion of similarity.\nTo address these challenges, we develop a new metric representation embedded\nas kernel parameters of a probabilistic model. This helps express the\ncorrelation between items that a user has interacted with, which can be used to\npredict user interaction with new items. Our approach hinges on the intuition\nthat similar items induce similar interactions from the same user, thus fitting\na metric-parameterized model to predict an implicit feedback signal could\nindirectly guide it towards finding the most suitable metric for each user. To\nthis end, we also analyze how and when the proposed method is effective from a\ntheoretical lens. Its empirical effectiveness is also demonstrated on several\nreal-world datasets.",

    "abstract": "Pre-training video transformers on extra large-scale datasets is generally\nrequired to achieve premier performance on relatively small datasets. In this\npaper, we show that video masked autoencoders (VideoMAE) are data-efficient\nlearners for self-supervised video pre-training (SSVP). We are inspired by the\nrecent ImageMAE and propose customized video tube masking and reconstruction.\nThese simple designs turn out to be effective for overcoming information\nleakage caused by the temporal correlation during video reconstruction. We\nobtain three important findings on SSVP: (1) An extremely high proportion of\nmasking ratio (i.e., 90% to 95%) still yields favorable performance of\nVideoMAE. The temporally redundant video content enables higher masking ratio\nthan that of images. (2) VideoMAE achieves impressive results on very small\ndatasets (i.e., around 3k-4k videos) without using any extra data. This is\npartially ascribed to the challenging task of video reconstruction to enforce\nhigh-level structure learning. (3) VideoMAE shows that data quality is more\nimportant than data quantity for SSVP. Domain shift between pre-training and\ntarget datasets are important issues in SSVP. Notably, our VideoMAE with the\nvanilla ViT backbone can achieve 83.9% on Kinects-400, 75.3% on\nSomething-Something V2, 90.8% on UCF101, and 61.1% on HMDB51 without using any\nextra data.

    "abstract": "Pre-training has shown success in different areas of machine learning, such\nas Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and medical imaging.\nHowever, it has not been fully explored for clinical data analysis. Even though\nan immense amount of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data is recorded, data and\nlabels can be scarce if the data is collected in small hospitals or deals with\nrare diseases. In such scenarios, pre-training on a larger set of EHR data\ncould improve the model performance. In this paper, we apply unsupervised\npre-training to heterogeneous, multi-modal EHR data for patient outcome\nprediction. To model this data, we leverage graph deep learning over population\ngraphs. We first design a network architecture based on graph transformer\ndesigned to handle various input feature types occurring in EHR data, like\ncontinuous, discrete, and time-series features, allowing better multi-modal\ndata fusion. Further, we design pre-training methods based on masked imputation\nto pre-train our network before fine-tuning on different end tasks.\nPre-training is done in a fully unsupervised fashion, which lays the groundwork\nfor pre-training on large public datasets with different tasks and similar\nmodalities in the future. We test our method on two medical datasets of patient\nrecords, TADPOLE and MIMIC-III, including imaging and non-imaging features and\ndifferent prediction tasks. We find that our proposed graph based pre-training\nmethod helps in modeling the data at a population level and further improves\nperformance on the fine tuning tasks in terms of AUC on average by 4.15% for\nMIMIC and 7.64% for TADPOLE.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose to quantitatively compare loss functions based on\nparameterized Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat entropy and classical Shannon entropy for\nthe training of a deep network in the case of small datasets which are usually\nencountered in medical applications. Shannon cross-entropy is widely used as a\nloss function for most neural networks applied to the segmentation,\nclassification and detection of images. Shannon entropy is a particular case of\nTsallis-Havrda-Charvat entropy. In this work, we compare these two entropies\nthrough a medical application for predicting recurrence in patients with\nhead-neck and lung cancers after treatment. Based on both CT images and patient\ninformation, a multitask deep neural network is proposed to perform a\nrecurrence prediction task using cross-entropy as a loss function and an image\nreconstruction task. Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat cross-entropy is a parameterized\ncross entropy with the parameter $\\alpha$. Shannon entropy is a particular case\nof Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat entropy for $\\alpha$ = 1. The influence of this\nparameter on the final prediction results is studied. In this paper, the\nexperiments are conducted on two datasets including in total 580 patients, of\nwhom 434 suffered from head-neck cancers and 146 from lung cancers. The results\nshow that Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat entropy can achieve better performance in\nterms of prediction accuracy with some values of $\\alpha$.",

    "abstract": "There has been significant recent interest in quantum neural networks (QNNs),\nalong with their applications in diverse domains. Current solutions for QNNs\npose significant challenges concerning their scalability, ensuring that the\npostulates of quantum mechanics are satisfied and that the networks are\nphysically realizable. The exponential state space of QNNs poses challenges for\nthe scalability of training procedures. The no-cloning principle prohibits\nmaking multiple copies of training samples, and the measurement postulates lead\nto non-deterministic loss functions. Consequently, the physical realizability\nand efficiency of existing approaches that rely on repeated measurement of\nseveral copies of each sample for training QNNs are unclear. This paper\npresents a new model for QNNs that relies on band-limited Fourier expansions of\ntransfer functions of quantum perceptrons (QPs) to design scalable training\nprocedures. This training procedure is augmented with a randomized quantum\nstochastic gradient descent technique that eliminates the need for sample\nreplication. We show that this training procedure converges to the true minima\nin expectation, even in the presence of non-determinism due to quantum\nmeasurement. Our solution has a number of important benefits: (i) using QPs\nwith concentrated Fourier power spectrum, we show that the training procedure\nfor QNNs can be made scalable; (ii) it eliminates the need for resampling, thus\nstaying consistent with the no-cloning rule; and (iii) enhanced data efficiency\nfor the overall training process since each data sample is processed once per\nepoch. We present a detailed theoretical foundation for our models and methods'\nscalability, accuracy, and data efficiency.

    "abstract": "Living cell segmentation from bright-field light microscopic images is\nchallenging due to the image complexity and temporal changes in the living\ncells. Recently developed deep learning (DL)-based methods became popular in\nmedical and microscopic image segmentation tasks due to their success and\npromising outcomes. The main objective of this paper is to develop a deep\nlearning, UNet-based method to segment the living cells of the HeLa line in\nbright-field transmitted light microscopy. To find the most suitable\narchitecture for our datasets, we have proposed a residual attention U-Net and\ncompared it with an attention and a simple U-Net architecture. The attention\nmechanism highlights the remarkable features and suppresses activations in the\nirrelevant image regions. The residual mechanism overcomes with vanishing\ngradient problem. The Mean-IoU score for our datasets reaches 0.9505, 0.9524,\nand 0.9530 for the simple, attention, and residual attention U-Net,\nrespectively. We achieved the most accurate semantic segmentation results in\nthe Mean-IoU and Dice metrics by applying the residual and attention mechanisms\ntogether. The watershed method applied to this best - Residual Attention -\nsemantic segmentation result gave the segmentation with the specific\ninformation for each cell.",

    "abstract": "Accurately forecasting extreme rainfall is notoriously difficult, but is also\never more crucial for society as climate change increases the frequency of such\nextremes. Global numerical weather prediction models often fail to capture\nextremes, and are produced at too low a resolution to be actionable, while\nregional, high-resolution models are hugely expensive both in computation and\nlabour. In this paper we explore the use of deep generative models to\nsimultaneously correct and downscale (super-resolve) global ensemble forecasts\nover the Continental US. Specifically, using fine-grained radar observations as\nour ground truth, we train a conditional Generative Adversarial Network --\ncoined CorrectorGAN -- via a custom training procedure and augmented loss\nfunction, to produce ensembles of high-resolution, bias-corrected forecasts\nbased on coarse, global precipitation forecasts in addition to other relevant\nmeteorological fields. Our model outperforms an interpolation baseline, as well\nas super-resolution-only and CNN-based univariate methods, and approaches the\nperformance of an operational regional high-resolution model across an array of\nestablished probabilistic metrics. Crucially, CorrectorGAN, once trained,\nproduces predictions in seconds on a single machine. These results raise\nexciting questions about the necessity of regional models, and whether\ndata-driven downscaling and correction methods can be transferred to data-poor\nregions that so far have had no access to high-resolution forecasts.",

    "abstract": "Measuring and quantifying dependencies between random variables (RV's) can\ngive critical insights into a data-set. Typical questions are: `Do underlying\nrelationships exist?', `Are some variables redundant?', and `Is some target\nvariable $Y$ highly or weakly dependent on variable $X$?' Interestingly,\ndespite the evident need for a general-purpose measure of dependency between\nRV's, common practice of data analysis is that most data analysts use the\nPearson correlation coefficient (PCC) to quantify dependence between RV's,\nwhile it is well-recognized that the PCC is essentially a measure for linear\ndependency only. Although many attempts have been made to define more generic\ndependency measures, there is yet no consensus on a standard, general-purpose\ndependency function. In fact, several ideal properties of a dependency function\nhave been proposed, but without much argumentation. Motivated by this, in this\npaper we will discuss and revise the list of desired properties and propose a\nnew dependency function that meets all these requirements. This general-purpose\ndependency function provides data analysts a powerful means to quantify the\nlevel of dependence between variables. To this end, we also provide Python code\nto determine the dependency function for use in practice.",

Yet, it is well-known that the\ndecision-makers routinely use soft text-based documents that interpret the hard\ndata they narrate. Recent advances in computational methods for analyzing\nunstructured and soft text-based data at scale offer possibilities for\nunderstanding financial market behavior that could improve investments and\nmarket equity. A critical and ubiquitous form of soft data are earnings calls.\nEarnings calls are periodic (often quarterly) statements usually by CEOs who\nattempt to influence investors' expectations of a company's past and future\nperformance. Here, we study the statistical relationship between earnings\ncalls, company sales, stock performance, and analysts' recommendations. Our\nstudy covers a decade of observations with approximately 100,000 transcripts of\nearnings calls from 6,300 public companies from January 2010 to December 2019.\nIn this study, we report three novel findings. First, the buy, sell and hold\nrecommendations from professional analysts made prior to the earnings have low\ncorrelation with stock price movements after the earnings call. Second, using\nour graph neural network based method that processes the semantic features of\nearnings calls, we reliably and accurately predict stock price movements in\nfive major areas of the economy. Third, the semantic features of transcripts\nare more predictive of stock price movements than sales and earnings per share,\ni.e., traditional hard data in most of the cases.",

In addition, from the time of the early\ncivilizations, lottery has also been considered as an apposite method to\nallocate scarce resources. Technically, any scheme for lottery needs to be fair\nand secure, but none of the classical schemes for lottery are unconditionally\nsecure and fair. As fairness demands complete unpredictability of the outcome\nof the lottery, it essentially requires perfect randomness. Quantum mechanics\nnot only guarantees the generation of perfect randomness, it can also provide\nunconditional security. Motivated by these facts, a set of strategies for\nperforming lottery using different type of quantum resources (e.g., single\nphoton states, and entangled states) are proposed here, and it's established\nthat the proposed strategies leads to unconditionally secure and fair lottery\nschemes. A scheme for semi-quantum lottery that allows some classical users to\nparticipate in the lottery involving quantum resources is also proposed and the\nmerits and demerits of all the proposed schemes are critically analysed. Its\nalso established that the level of security is intrinsically related to the\ntype of quantum resources being utilized. Further, its shown that the proposed\nschemes can be experimentally realized using currently available technology,\nand that may herald a new era of commercial lottery.",

The algorithm performs Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (MCMC), a popular iterative sampling technique, to sample\nfrom the Boltzmann distribution of classical Ising models. In each step, the\nquantum processor explores the model in superposition to propose a random move,\nwhich is then accepted or rejected by a classical computer and returned to the\nquantum processor, ensuring convergence to the desired Boltzmann distribution.\nWe find that this quantum algorithm converges in fewer iterations than common\nclassical MCMC alternatives on relevant problem instances, both in simulations\nand experiments.

Fine-tuning the entire model or\na subset of the parameters using light-weight adaptation has shown considerable\nsuccess across different specialization tasks.

Once these models are trained, deploying\nthem also poses significant scalability challenges for inference for real-time\napplications. In this paper, building upon prior light-weight adaptation\ntechniques, we propose a modular framework that enables us to substantially\nimprove scalability for model training and inference. We introduce Submodels\nthat can be quickly and dynamically loaded for on-the-fly inference. We also\npropose multiple approaches for training those Submodels in parallel using an\nembedding space in the same training job. We test our framework on an extreme\nuse-case which is speech model personalization for atypical speech, requiring a\nSubmodel for each user.

    "title": "Deep Learning based Intelligent Coin-tap Test for Defect Recognition",
    "abstract": "The coin-tap test is a convenient and primary method for non-destructive\ntesting, while its manual on-site operation is tough and costly. With the help\nof the latest intelligent signal processing method, convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNN), we achieve an intelligent coin-tap test which exhibited\nsuperior performance in recognizing the defects. However, this success of CNNs\nrelies on plenty of well-labeled data from the identical scenario, which could\nbe difficult to get for many real industrial practices. This paper further\ndevelops transfer learning strategies for this issue, that is, to transfer the\nmodel trained on data of one scenario to another. In experiments, the result\npresents a notable improvement by using domain adaptation and pseudo label\nlearning strategies. Hence, it becomes possible to apply the model into\nscenarios with none or little (less than 10\\%) labeled data adopting the\ntransfer learning strategies proposed herein. In addition, we used a benchmark\ndataset constructed ourselves throughout this study. This benchmark dataset for\nthe coin-tap test containing around 100,000 sound signals is published at\nhttps://github.com/PPhub-hy/torch-tapnet.",

    "abstract": "Heart rate variability (HRV) is a practical and noninvasive measure of\nautonomic nervous system activity, which plays an essential role in\ncardiovascular health. However, using HRV to assess physiology status is\nchallenging. Even in clinical settings, HRV is sensitive to acute stressors\nsuch as physical activity, mental stress, hydration, alcohol, and sleep.\nWearable devices provide convenient HRV measurements, but the irregularity of\nmeasurements and uncaptured stressors can bias conventional analytical methods.\nTo better interpret HRV measurements for downstream healthcare applications, we\nlearn a personalized diurnal rhythm as an accurate physiological indicator for\neach individual. We develop Physiological Multitask-Learning (PhysioMTL) by\nharnessing Optimal Transport theory within a Multitask-learning (MTL)\nframework. The proposed method learns an individual-specific predictive model\nfrom heterogeneous observations, and enables estimation of an optimal transport\nmap that yields a push forward operation onto the demographic features for each\ntask. Our model outperforms competing MTL methodologies on unobserved\npredictive tasks for synthetic and two real-world datasets. Specifically, our\nmethod provides remarkable prediction results on unseen held-out subjects given\nonly $20\\%$ of the subjects in real-world observational studies. Furthermore,\nour model enables a counterfactual engine that generates the effect of acute\nstressors and chronic conditions on HRV rhythms.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes low complexity detection for internet of underwater\nthings (IoUT)s communication. The signal is transmitted from the source to the\ndestination using several sensors. To simplify the computational operations at\nthe transmitter and the sensory nodes, a single carrier frequency domain\nequalizer (SC-FDE) is proposed and amplify-and-forward (AF) protocols are\nemployed. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and use of cyclic prefix (CP) are also\nproposed to simplify these algorithms when compared to time-domain\nequalization. As precise channel data is difficult to capture in underwater\ncommunications, the adaptive implementation of FDE is proposed as a solution\nthat can be employed when the channel experiences a fast doppler shift. The two\nadaptive detectors are based on the least mean-square (LMS) and recursive least\nsquare (RLS) principles. Numerical simulations show that the performance of the\nbit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed detectors is close to that of\nthe ideal minimum mean square error (MMSE).",

    "abstract": "Optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR) has been widely used for\ncharacterizing fiber optical links and for detecting and locating fiber faults.\nOTDR traces are prone to be distorted by different kinds of noise, causing\nblurring of the backscattered signals, and thereby leading to a misleading\ninterpretation and a more cumbersome event detection task. To address this\nproblem, a novel method combining a denoising convolutional autoencoder (DCAE)\nand a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) is proposed, whereby the\nformer is used for noise removal of OTDR signals and the latter for fault\ndetection, localization, and diagnosis with the denoised signal as input. The\nproposed approach is applied to noisy OTDR signals of different levels of input\nSNR ranging from -5 dB to 15 dB. The experimental results demonstrate that: (i)\nthe DCAE is efficient in denoising the OTDR traces and it outperforms other\ndeep learning techniques and the conventional denoising methods; and (ii) the\nBiLSTM achieves a high detection and diagnostic accuracy of 96.7% with an\nimprovement of 13.74% compared to the performance of the same model trained\nwith noisy OTDR signals.",
