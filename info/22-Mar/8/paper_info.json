    "abstract": "We accelerate the 4-bit product quantization (PQ) on the ARM architecture.\nNotably, the drastic performance of the conventional 4-bit PQ strongly relies\non x64-specific SIMD register, such as AVX2; hence, we cannot yet achieve such\ngood performance on ARM. To fill this gap, we first bundle two 128-bit\nregisters as one 256-bit component. We then apply shuffle operations for each\nusing the ARM-specific NEON instruction. By making this simple but critical\nmodification, we achieve a dramatic speedup for the 4-bit PQ on an ARM\narchitecture. Experiments show that the proposed method consistently achieves a\n10x improvement over the naive PQ with the same accuracy.",

For the sake of comprehension, the scenario of model\noperation prior and later to the occurrence of the disaster is referred to as\nthe normal scenario and as the catastrophic scenario, respectively. In the\nnormal scenario, the incoming heterogeneous calls are categorized as handoff\ncalls and new calls. Handoff calls are provided controllable preemptive\npriority over new calls. In the catastrophic scenario, when a disaster causes\nthe shut down of the entire system and failure of all functioning channels, a\nset of backup channels is quickly deployed to restore services. Due to the\nemergency situation in the concerned area, the incoming heterogeneous calls are\ndivided into three categories: handoff, new call, and emergency calls.\nEmergency calls are provided controllable preemptive priority over new/handoff\ncalls due to the pressing need to save lives in such situations. The Markov\nchain's ergodicity criteria are established by demonstrating that it belongs to\nthe class of asymptotically quasi-Toeplitz Markov chains (AQTMC). Further, a\nmulti-objective optimization problem to obtain optimal number of backup\nchannels has been formulated and dealt by employing non-dominated sorting\ngenetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) approach.",

A\nsequence-to-vector transformation defines features for each explored\nimplementation, and each implementation is assigned a class label according to\nits relative performance. A decision tree is trained on the features and labels\nto produce design rules for each class; these rules can be used by systems\nexperts to guide their implementations.

Unfortunately, a key challenge for HE is\nthat implementations can be impractically slow and have limits on computation\nthat can be efficiently implemented. For instance, in Boolean constructions of\nHE like TFHE, arithmetic operations need to be decomposed into constituent\nelementary logic gates to implement so performance depends on logical circuit\ndepth. For even heavily quantized fixed-point arithmetic operations, these HE\ncircuit implementations can be slow.\nThis paper explores the merit of using stochastic computing (SC) encodings to\nreduce the logical depth required for HE computation to enable more efficient\nimplementations. Contrary to computation in the plaintext space where many\nefficient hardware implementations are available, HE provides support for only\na limited number of primitive operators and their performance may not directly\ncorrelate to their plaintext performance.

    "abstract": "Pruning is a popular technique for reducing the model size and computational\ncost of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, a slow retraining or\nfine-tuning procedure is often required to recover the accuracy loss caused by\npruning. Recently, a new research direction on weight pruning,\npruning-at-initialization (PAI), is proposed to directly prune CNNs before\ntraining so that fine-tuning or retraining can be avoided. While PAI has shown\npromising results in reducing the model size, existing approaches rely on\nfine-grained weight pruning which requires unstructured sparse matrix\ncomputation, making it difficult to achieve real speedup in practice unless the\nsparsity is very high.\nThis work is the first to show that fine-grained weight pruning is in fact\nnot necessary for PAI. Instead, the layerwise compression ratio is the main\ncritical factor to determine the accuracy of a CNN model pruned at\ninitialization. Based on this key observation, we propose PreCropping, a\nstructured hardware-efficient model compression scheme. PreCropping directly\ncompresses the model at the channel level following the layerwise compression\nratio. Compared to weight pruning, the proposed scheme is regular and dense in\nboth storage and computation without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, since\nPreCropping compresses CNNs at initialization, the computational and memory\ncosts of CNNs are reduced for both training and inference on commodity\nhardware. We empirically demonstrate our approaches on several modern CNN\narchitectures, including ResNet, ShuffleNet, and MobileNet for both CIFAR-10\nand ImageNet.",

    "abstract": "User-facing applications running in modern datacenters exhibit irregular\nrequest patterns and are implemented using a multitude of services with tight\nlatency requirements. These characteristics render ineffective existing energy\nconserving techniques when processors are idle due to the long transition time\nfrom a deep idle power state (C-state). While prior works propose management\ntechniques to mitigate this inefficiency, we tackle it at its root with\nAgileWatts (AW): a new deep C-state architecture optimized for datacenter\nserver processors targeting latency-sensitive applications. AW is based on\nthree key ideas. First, AW eliminates the latency overhead of saving/restoring\nthe core context (i.e., micro-architectural state) when powering-off/-on the\ncore in a deep idle power state by i) implementing medium-grained power-gates,\ncarefully distributed across the CPU core, and ii) retaining context in the\npower-ungated domain. Second, AW eliminates the flush latency overhead (several\ntens of microseconds) of the L1/L2 caches when entering a deep idle power state\nby keeping L1/L2 cache content power-ungated. A minimal control logic also\nremains power-ungated to serve cache coherence traffic (i.e., snoops)\nseamlessly. AW implements sleep-mode in caches to reduce caches leakage power\nconsumption and lowers a core voltage to the minimum operational voltage level\nto minimize the leakage power of the power-ungated domain. Third, using a\nstate-of-the-art power efficient all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) clock\ngenerator, AW keeps the PLL active and locked during the idle state, further\ncutting precious microseconds of wake-up latency at a negligible power cost.\nOur evaluation with an accurate simulator calibrated against an Intel Skylake\nserver shows that AW reduces the energy consumption of Memcached by up to 71%\n(35% on average) with up to 1% performance degradation.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a multi-domain control parameter learning framework\nthat combines Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Hybrid Zero Dynamics (HZD) for\nlocomotion control of bipedal robots. We leverage BO to learn the control\nparameters used in the HZD-based controller. The learning process is firstly\ndeployed in simulation to optimize different control parameters for a large\nrepertoire of gaits. Next, to tackle the discrepancy between the simulation and\nthe real world, the learning process is applied on the physical robot to learn\nfor corrections to the control parameters learned in simulation while also\nrespecting a safety constraint for gait stability. This method empowers an\nefficient sim-to-real transition with a small number of samples in the real\nworld, and does not require a valid controller to initialize the training in\nsimulation. Our proposed learning framework is experimentally deployed and\nvalidated on a bipedal robot Cassie to perform versatile locomotion skills with\nimproved performance on smoothness of walking gaits and reduction of\nsteady-state tracking errors.",

    "abstract": "Most methods for conditional video synthesis use a single modality as the\ncondition. This comes with major limitations. For example, it is problematic\nfor a model conditioned on an image to generate a specific motion trajectory\ndesired by the user since there is no means to provide motion information.\nConversely, language information can describe the desired motion, while not\nprecisely defining the content of the video. This work presents a multimodal\nvideo generation framework that benefits from text and images provided jointly\nor separately. We leverage the recent progress in quantized representations for\nvideos and apply a bidirectional transformer with multiple modalities as inputs\nto predict a discrete video representation. To improve video quality and\nconsistency, we propose a new video token trained with self-learning and an\nimproved mask-prediction algorithm for sampling video tokens. We introduce text\naugmentation to improve the robustness of the textual representation and\ndiversity of generated videos. Our framework can incorporate various visual\nmodalities, such as segmentation masks, drawings, and partially occluded\nimages. It can generate much longer sequences than the one used for training.\nIn addition, our model can extract visual information as suggested by the text\nprompt, e.g., \"an object in image one is moving northeast\", and generate\ncorresponding videos. We run evaluations on three public datasets and a newly\ncollected dataset labeled with facial attributes, achieving state-of-the-art\ngeneration results on all four.",

Many commonly used NFs such as\nfirewalls, load balancers and NATs are shallow - i.e., they only examine the\npacket's header, despite the entire packet being transferred on and off the\nserver. As a result, the gap between moved and inspected data when handling\nlarge packets exceeds 20x. At modern network rates, such excess data movement\nis detrimental to performance, hurting both the average and 90% tail latency of\nlarge packets by up to 1.7x. Our thorough performance analysis identifies high\ncontention on the NIC-server PCIe interface and in the server's memory\nhierarchy as the main bottlenecks.\nWe introduce NFSlicer, a data movement optimization implemented as a NIC\nextension to mitigate the bottlenecks stemming from data movement deluge in\ndeployments of shallow NFs on commodity servers. NFSlicer only transfers the\nsmall portion of each packet that the deployed NFs actually inspect, by slicing\nthe packet's payload and temporarily storing it in on-NIC memory. When the\nserver later transmits the processed packet, NFSlicer splices it to its\npreviously sliced payload. We develop a software-based emulation platform and\ndemonstrate that NFSlicer effectively minimizes data movement between the NIC\nand the server, bridging the latency gap between small and large packet NF\nprocessing. On a range of shallow NFs handling 1518B packets, NFSlicer reduces\naverage and 90% tail latency by up to 17% / 29%, respectively.",

In recent years, the method has gained in\npopularity in a number of areas, including isogeometric analysis, immersed\nmethods, and contact mechanics. However, arriving at a formulation based on\nNitsche's method can be a mathematically arduous process, especially for\nhigh-order PDEs. Fortunately, the derivation is conceptually straightforward in\nthe context of variational problems. To facilitate the process, we devised an\nabstract framework for constructing Nitsche's method for these types of\nproblems in [J. Benzaken, J. A. Evans, S. McCormick, and R.

The\ngoal of this paper is to elucidate the process through a sequence of didactic\nexamples. First, we show the derivation of Nitsche's method for Poisson's\nequation to gain an intuition for the various steps. Next, we present the\nabstract framework and then revisit the derivation for Poisson's equation to\nuse the framework and add mathematical rigor. In the process, we extend our\nderivation to cover the vector-valued setting.

    "abstract": "Recently, the EAGL-I system was developed to rapidly create massive labeled\ndatasets of plants intended to be commonly used by farmers and researchers to\ncreate AI-driven solutions in agriculture. As a result, a publicly available\nplant species recognition dataset composed of 40,000 images with different\nsizes consisting of 8 plant species was created with the system in order to\ndemonstrate its capabilities. This paper proposes a novel method, called\nVariably Overlapping Time-Coherent Sliding Window (VOTCSW), that transforms a\ndataset composed of images with variable size to a 3D representation with fixed\nsize that is suitable for convolutional neural networks, and demonstrates that\nthis representation is more informative than resizing the images of the dataset\nto a given size. We theoretically formalized the use cases of the method as\nwell as its inherent properties and we proved that it has an oversampling and a\nregularization effect on the data. By combining the VOTCSW method with the 3D\nextension of a recently proposed machine learning model called 1-Dimensional\nPolynomial Neural Networks, we were able to create a model that achieved a\nstate-of-the-art accuracy of 99.9% on the dataset created by the EAGL-I system,\nsurpassing well-known architectures such as ResNet and Inception. In addition,\nwe created a heuristic algorithm that enables the degree reduction of any\npre-trained N-Dimensional Polynomial Neural Network and which compresses it\nwithout altering its performance, thus making the model faster and lighter.\nFurthermore, we established that the currently available dataset could not be\nused for machine learning in its present form, due to a substantial class\nimbalance between the training set and the test set. Hence, we created a\nspecific preprocessing and a model development framework that enabled us to\nimprove the accuracy from 49.23% to 99.9%.",

    "title": "How to Train Unstable Looped Tensor Network",
    "abstract": "A rising problem in the compression of Deep Neural Networks is how to reduce\nthe number of parameters in convolutional kernels and the complexity of these\nlayers by low-rank tensor approximation. Canonical polyadic tensor\ndecomposition (CPD) and Tucker tensor decomposition (TKD) are two solutions to\nthis problem and provide promising results. However, CPD often fails due to\ndegeneracy, making the networks unstable and hard to fine-tune. TKD does not\nprovide much compression if the core tensor is big. This motivates using a\nhybrid model of CPD and TKD, a decomposition with multiple Tucker models with\nsmall core tensor, known as block term decomposition (BTD). This paper proposes\na more compact model that further compresses the BTD by enforcing core tensors\nin BTD identical. We establish a link between the BTD with shared parameters\nand a looped chain tensor network (TC). Unfortunately, such strongly\nconstrained tensor networks (with loop) encounter severe numerical instability,\nas proved by y (Landsberg, 2012) and (Handschuh, 2015a). We study perturbation\nof chain tensor networks, provide interpretation of instability in TC,\ndemonstrate the problem. We propose novel methods to gain the stability of the\ndecomposition results, keep the network robust and attain better approximation.\nExperimental results will confirm the superiority of the proposed methods in\ncompression of well-known CNNs, and TC decomposition under challenging\nscenarios",

As large-scale\nvariations often exist within crowd images, neither fixed-size convolution\nkernel of CNN nor fixed-size attention of recent vision transformers can well\nhandle this kind of variation. To address this problem, we propose a\nMultifaceted Attention Network (MAN) to improve transformer models in local\nspatial relation encoding. MAN incorporates global attention from a vanilla\ntransformer, learnable local attention, and instance attention into a counting\nmodel. Firstly, the local Learnable Region Attention (LRA) is proposed to\nassign attention exclusively for each feature location dynamically. Secondly,\nwe design the Local Attention Regularization to supervise the training of LRA\nby minimizing the deviation among the attention for different feature\nlocations. Finally, we provide an Instance Attention mechanism to focus on the\nmost important instances dynamically during training.

    "abstract": "Designing control policies for legged locomotion is complex due to the\nunder-actuated and non-continuous robot dynamics. Model-free reinforcement\nlearning provides promising tools to tackle this challenge. However, a major\nbottleneck of applying model-free reinforcement learning in real world is\nsafety. In this paper, we propose a safe reinforcement learning framework that\nswitches between a safe recovery policy that prevents the robot from entering\nunsafe states, and a learner policy that is optimized to complete the task. The\nsafe recovery policy takes over the control when the learner policy violates\nsafety constraints, and hands over the control back when there are no future\nsafety violations. We design the safe recovery policy so that it ensures safety\nof legged locomotion while minimally intervening in the learning process.\nFurthermore, we theoretically analyze the proposed framework and provide an\nupper bound on the task performance. We verify the proposed framework in four\nlocomotion tasks on a simulated and real quadrupedal robot: efficient gait,\ncatwalk, two-leg balance, and pacing. On average, our method achieves 48.6%\nfewer falls and comparable or better rewards than the baseline methods in\nsimulation. When deployed it on real-world quadruped robot, our training\npipeline enables 34% improvement in energy efficiency for the efficient gait,\n40.9% narrower of the feet placement in the catwalk, and two times more jumping\nduration in the two-leg balance.

Although a variety of FL algorithms have been\nproposed, their training efficiency remains low when the data are not\nindependently and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) across different\nclients. We observe that the slow convergence rates of the existing methods are\n(at least partially) caused by the catastrophic forgetting issue during the\nlocal training stage on each individual client, which leads to a large increase\nin the loss function concerning the previous training data at the other\nclients.

However, validation performance does not\nsuccessfully represent test performance, i.e., potential performance. Also,\nalthough fine-tuning the pruned network to restore the performance drop is an\ninevitable process, few studies have handled this issue. This paper proposes a\nnovel sub-network search and fine-tuning method that is named Ensemble\nKnowledge Guidance (EKG). First, we experimentally prove that the fluctuation\nof the loss landscape is an effective metric to evaluate the potential\nperformance. In order to search a sub-network with the smoothest loss landscape\nat a low cost, we propose a pseudo-supernet built by an ensemble sub-network\nknowledge distillation. Next, we propose a novel fine-tuning that re-uses the\ninformation of the search phase. We store the interim sub-networks, that is,\nthe by-products of the search phase, and transfer their knowledge into the\npruned network. Note that EKG is easy to be plugged-in and computationally\nefficient. For example, in the case of ResNet-50, about 45% of FLOPS is removed\nwithout any performance drop in only 315 GPU hours.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce VCSL (Video Copy Segment Localization), a new\ncomprehensive segment-level annotated video copy dataset. Compared with\nexisting copy detection datasets restricted by either video-level annotation or\nsmall-scale, VCSL not only has two orders of magnitude more segment-level\nlabelled data, with 160k realistic video copy pairs containing more than 280k\nlocalized copied segment pairs, but also covers a variety of video categories\nand a wide range of video duration. All the copied segments inside each\ncollected video pair are manually extracted and accompanied by precisely\nannotated starting and ending timestamps. Alongside the dataset, we also\npropose a novel evaluation protocol that better measures the prediction\naccuracy of copy overlapping segments between a video pair and shows improved\nadaptability in different scenarios. By benchmarking several baseline and\nstate-of-the-art segment-level video copy detection methods with the proposed\ndataset and evaluation metric, we provide a comprehensive analysis that\nuncovers the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches, hoping to open up\npromising directions for future works.

    "abstract": "Network embedding is an effective technique to learn the low-dimensional\nrepresentations of nodes in networks. Real-world networks are usually with\nmultiplex or having multi-view representations from different relations.\nRecently, there has been increasing interest in network embedding on multiplex\ndata. However, most existing multiplex approaches assume that the data is\ncomplete in all views. But in real applications, it is often the case that each\nview suffers from the missing of some data and therefore results in partial\nmultiplex data. In this paper, we present a novel Deep Partial Multiplex\nNetwork Embedding approach to deal with incomplete data. In particular, the\nnetwork embeddings are learned by simultaneously minimizing the deep\nreconstruction loss with the autoencoder neural network, enforcing the data\nconsistency across views via common latent subspace learning, and preserving\nthe data topological structure within the same network through graph Laplacian.\nWe further prove the orthogonal invariant property of the learned embeddings\nand connect our approach with the binary embedding techniques.

    "abstract": "Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels is an\nimportant and challenging task. Due to the high training efficiency, end-to-end\nsolutions for WSSS have received increasing attention from the community.\nHowever, current methods are mainly based on convolutional neural networks and\nfail to explore the global information properly, thus usually resulting in\nincomplete object regions. In this paper, to address the aforementioned\nproblem, we introduce Transformers, which naturally integrate global\ninformation, to generate more integral initial pseudo labels for end-to-end\nWSSS. Motivated by the inherent consistency between the self-attention in\nTransformers and the semantic affinity, we propose an Affinity from Attention\n(AFA) module to learn semantic affinity from the multi-head self-attention\n(MHSA) in Transformers. The learned affinity is then leveraged to refine the\ninitial pseudo labels for segmentation. In addition, to efficiently derive\nreliable affinity labels for supervising AFA and ensure the local consistency\nof pseudo labels, we devise a Pixel-Adaptive Refinement module that\nincorporates low-level image appearance information to refine the pseudo\nlabels.

As only a fixed set of image-level object labels\nare available to the WSSS (weakly supervised semantic segmentation) model, it\ncould be very difficult to suppress those diverse background regions consisting\nof open set objects. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross Language Image\nMatching (CLIMS) framework, based on the recently introduced Contrastive\nLanguage-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, for WSSS. The core idea of our\nframework is to introduce natural language supervision to activate more\ncomplete object regions and suppress closely-related open background regions.\nIn particular, we design object, background region and text label matching\nlosses to guide the model to excite more reasonable object regions for CAM of\neach category.

    "abstract": "The use of FPGAs for efficient graph processing has attracted significant\ninterest. Recent memory subsystem upgrades including the introduction of HBM in\nFPGAs promise to further alleviate memory bottlenecks. However, modern\nmulti-channel HBM requires much more processing pipelines to fully utilize its\nbandwidth potential. Existing designs do not scale well, resulting in\nunderutilization of the HBM facilities even when all other resources are fully\nconsumed. In this paper, we re-examined the graph processing workloads and\nfound much diversity in processing. We also found that the diverse workloads\ncan be easily classified into two types, namely dense and sparse partitions.\nThis motivates us to propose a resource-efficient heterogeneous pipeline\narchitecture. Our heterogeneous architecture comprises of two types of\npipelines: Little pipelines to process dense partitions with good locality and\nBig pipelines to process sparse partitions with the extremely poor locality.\nUnlike traditional monolithic pipeline designs, the heterogeneous pipelines are\ntailored for more specific memory access patterns, and hence are more\nlightweight, allowing the architecture to scale up to more effectively with\nlimited resources. In addition, we propose a model-guided task scheduling\nmethod that schedules partitions to the right pipeline types, generates the\nmost efficient pipeline combination and balances workloads. Furthermore, we\ndevelop an automated open-source framework, called ReGraph, which automates the\nentire development process.

To combine the advantages of two\nvocoders, inspired by the traditional deterministic plus stochastic model, this\npaper proposes a novel neural vocoder named NeuralDPS which can retain high\nspeech quality and acquire high synthesis efficiency and noise controllability.\nFirstly, this framework contains four modules: a deterministic source module, a\nstochastic source module, a neural V/UV decision module and a neural filter\nmodule. The input required by the vocoder is just the spectral parameter, which\navoids the error caused by estimating additional parameters, such as F0.\nSecondly, to solve the problem that different frequency bands may have\ndifferent proportions of deterministic components and stochastic components, a\nmultiband excitation strategy is used to generate a more accurate excitation\nsignal and reduce the neural filter's burden. Thirdly, a method to control\nnoise components of speech is proposed. In this way, the signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) of speech can be adjusted easily. Objective and subjective experimental\nresults show that our proposed NeuralDPS vocoder can obtain similar performance\nwith the WaveNet and it generates waveforms at least 280 times faster than the\nWaveNet vocoder.

In spite of the\nadvantages, cloud computing also suffers from distinct challenges, and one of\nthem is the inefficient resource provisioning for dynamic workloads. Accurate\nworkload predictions for cloud computing can support efficient resource\nprovisioning and avoid resource wastage. However, due to the high-dimensional\nand high-variable features of cloud workloads, it is difficult to predict the\nworkloads effectively and accurately. The current dominant work for cloud\nworkload prediction is based on regression approaches or recurrent neural\nnetworks, which fail to capture the long-term variance of workloads. To address\nthe challenges and overcome the limitations of existing works, we proposed an\nefficient supervised learning-based Deep Neural Network (esDNN}) approach for\ncloud workload prediction. Firstly, we utilize a sliding window to convert the\nmultivariate data into supervised learning time series that allow deep learning\nfor processing. Then we apply a revised Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to achieve\naccurate prediction. To show the effectiveness of esDNN, we also conduct\ncomprehensive experiments based on realistic traces derived from Alibaba and\nGoogle cloud data centers. The experimental results demonstrate that esDNN can\naccurately and efficiently predict cloud workloads. Compared with the\nstate-of-the-art baselines, esDNN can reduce the mean square errors\nsignificantly, e.g. 15% than the approach using GRU only. We also apply esDNN\nfor machines auto-scaling, which illustrates that esDNN can reduce the number\nof active hosts efficiently, thus the costs of service providers can be\noptimized.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of federated domain generalization\n(FedDG) for person re-identification (re-ID), which aims to learn a generalized\nmodel with multiple decentralized labeled source domains. An empirical method\n(FedAvg) trains local models individually and averages them to obtain the\nglobal model for further local fine-tuning or deploying in unseen target\ndomains. One drawback of FedAvg is neglecting the data distributions of other\nclients during local training, making the local model overfit local data and\nproducing a poorly-generalized global model. To solve this problem, we propose\na novel method, called \"Domain and Feature Hallucinating (DFH)\", to produce\ndiverse features for learning generalized local and global models.\nSpecifically, after each model aggregation process, we share the Domain-level\nFeature Statistics (DFS) among different clients without violating data\nprivacy. During local training, the DFS are used to synthesize novel domain\nstatistics with the proposed domain hallucinating, which is achieved by\nre-weighting DFS with random weights. Then, we propose feature hallucinating to\ndiversify local features by scaling and shifting them to the distribution of\nthe obtained novel domain. The synthesized novel features retain the original\npair-wise similarities, enabling us to utilize them to optimize the model in a\nsupervised manner. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed DFH can\neffectively improve the generalization ability of the global model. Our method\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance for FedDG on four large-scale re-ID\nbenchmarks.",

    "abstract": "A recent runtime analysis (Zheng, Liu, Doerr (2022)) has shown that a variant\nof the NSGA-II algorithm can efficiently compute the full Pareto front of the\nOneMinMax problem when the population size is by a constant factor larger than\nthe Pareto front, but that this is not possible when the population size is\nonly equal to the Pareto front size. In this work, we analyze how well the\nNSGA-II approximates the Pareto front when it cannot compute the whole front.\nWe observe experimentally and by mathematical means that already when the\npopulation size is half the Pareto front size, relatively large gaps in the\nPareto front remain. The reason for this phenomenon is that the NSGA-II in the\nselection stage computes the crowding distance once and then repeatedly removes\nindividuals with smallest crowding distance without updating the crowding\ndistance after each removal. We propose an efficient way to implement the\nNSGA-II using the momentary crowding distance. In our experiments, this\nalgorithm approximates the Pareto front much better than the previous version.\nWe also prove that the gaps in the Pareto front are at most a constant factor\nlarger than the theoretical minimum.",

Several approaches have been proposed to learn\nuser-specific pattern ranking functions. These approaches generalize well, but\nat the expense of the running time.

In this\npaper, we formulate the problem of learning pattern ranking functions as a\nmulticriteria decision making problem. Our approach aggregates different\ninterestingness measures into a single weighted linear ranking function, using\nan interactive learning procedure that operates in either passive or active\nmodes. A fast learning step is used for eliciting the weights of all the\nmeasures by mean of pairwise comparisons.\nThis approach is based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and a set of\nuser-ranked patterns to build a preference matrix, which compares the\nimportance of measures according to the user-specific interestingness. A\nsensitivity based heuristic is proposed for the active learning mode, in order\nto insure high quality results with few user ranking queries.

Redirection techniques decouple tracked physical\nmotion and virtual motion, allowing users to explore virtual environments with\nmore flexibility. In seated situations with only head movements available, the\ndifference of stimulus might cause the detection thresholds of rotation gains\nto differ from that of redirected walking. Therefore we present an experiment\nwith a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) design to compare the thresholds\nfor seated and standing situations. Results indicate that users are unable to\ndiscriminate rotation gains between 0.89 and 1.28, a smaller range compared to\nthe standing condition.

Recent state-of-the-art methods usually design sophisticated\nlearning pipelines to tackle this task. However, visual information alone is\noften not sufficient to accurately differentiate between fine-grained visual\ncategories. Nowadays, the meta-information (e.g., spatio-temporal prior,\nattribute, and text description) usually appears along with the images. This\ninspires us to ask the question: Is it possible to use a unified and simple\nframework to utilize various meta-information to assist in fine-grained\nidentification? To answer this problem, we explore a unified and strong\nmeta-framework(MetaFormer) for fine-grained visual classification. In practice,\nMetaFormer provides a simple yet effective approach to address the joint\nlearning of vision and various meta-information. Moreover, MetaFormer also\nprovides a strong baseline for FGVC without bells and whistles.

To bridge the\ndiscrete-to-continuous gap, we propose a predictor to generate a set of\ncandidate waypoints during navigation, so that agents designed with high-level\nactions can be transferred to and trained in continuous environments. We refine\nthe connectivity graph of Matterport3D to fit the continuous\nHabitat-Matterport3D, and train the waypoints predictor with the refined graphs\nto produce accessible waypoints at each time step. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthat the predicted waypoints can be augmented during training to diversify the\nviews and paths, and therefore enhance agent's generalization ability. Through\nextensive experiments we show that agents navigating in continuous environments\nwith predicted waypoints perform significantly better than agents using\nlow-level actions, which reduces the absolute discrete-to-continuous gap by\n11.76% Success Weighted by Path Length (SPL) for the Cross-Modal Matching Agent\nand 18.24% SPL for the Recurrent VLN-BERT. Our agents, trained with a simple\nimitation learning objective, outperform previous methods by a large margin,\nachieving new state-of-the-art results on the testing environments of the\nR2R-CE and the RxR-CE datasets.",

    "abstract": "Industrial bin picking is a challenging task that requires accurate and\nrobust segmentation of individual object instances. Particularly, industrial\nobjects can have irregular shapes, that is, thin and concave, whereas in\nbin-picking scenarios, objects are often closely packed with strong occlusion.\nTo address these challenges, we formulate a novel part-aware instance\nsegmentation pipeline. The key idea is to decompose industrial objects into\ncorrelated approximate convex parts and enhance the object-level segmentation\nwith part-level segmentation. We design a part-aware network to predict part\nmasks and part-to-part offsets, followed by a part aggregation module to\nassemble the recognized parts into instances. To guide the network learning, we\nalso propose an automatic label decoupling scheme to generate ground-truth\npart-level labels from instance-level labels. Finally, we contribute the first\ninstance segmentation dataset, which contains a variety of industrial objects\nthat are thin and have non-trivial shapes. Extensive experimental results on\nvarious industrial objects demonstrate that our method can achieve the best\nsegmentation results compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have received an upsurging interest\nsince being proposed due to the high quality of the generated data. While\nachieving increasingly impressive results, the resource demands associated with\nthe large model size hinders the usage of GANs in resource-limited scenarios.\nFor inference, the existing model compression techniques can reduce the model\ncomplexity with comparable performance. However, the training efficiency of\nGANs has less been explored due to the fragile training process of GANs. In\nthis paper, we, for the first time, explore the possibility of directly\ntraining sparse GAN from scratch without involving any dense or pre-training\nsteps. Even more unconventionally, our proposed method enables directly\ntraining sparse unbalanced GANs with an extremely sparse generator from\nscratch. Instead of training full GANs, we start with sparse GANs and\ndynamically explore the parameter space spanned over the generator throughout\ntraining. Such a sparse-to-sparse training procedure enhances the capacity of\nthe highly sparse generator progressively while sticking to a fixed small\nparameter budget with appealing training and inference efficiency gains.\nExtensive experiments with modern GAN architectures validate the effectiveness\nof our method. Our sparsified GANs, trained from scratch in one single run, are\nable to outperform the ones learned by expensive iterative pruning and\nre-training. Perhaps most importantly, we find instead of inheriting parameters\nfrom expensive pre-trained GANs, directly training sparse GANs from scratch can\nbe a much more efficient solution. For example, only training with a 80% sparse\ngenerator and a 70% sparse discriminator, our method can achieve even better\nperformance than the dense BigGAN.",

    "abstract": "Human decision-making is plagued by many systematic errors. Many of these\nerrors can be avoided by providing decision aids that guide decision-makers to\nattend to the important information and integrate it according to a rational\ndecision strategy. Designing such decision aids is a tedious manual process.\nAdvances in cognitive science might make it possible to automate this process\nin the future. We recently introduced machine learning methods for discovering\noptimal strategies for human decision-making automatically and an automatic\nmethod for explaining those strategies to people. Decision aids constructed by\nthis method were able to improve human decision-making. However, following the\ndescriptions generated by this method is very tedious. We hypothesized that\nthis problem can be overcome by conveying the automatically discovered decision\nstrategy as a series of natural language instructions for how to reach a\ndecision. Experiment 1 showed that people do indeed understand such procedural\ninstructions more easily than the decision aids generated by our previous\nmethod. Encouraged by this finding, we developed an algorithm for translating\nthe output of our previous method into procedural instructions. We applied the\nimproved method to automatically generate decision aids for a naturalistic\nplanning task (i.e., planning a road trip) and a naturalistic decision task\n(i.e., choosing a mortgage). Experiment 2 showed that these automatically\ngenerated decision-aids significantly improved people's performance in planning\na road trip and choosing a mortgage.

Shippers typically\nclear the invoice payment within 60-90 days of goods getting delivered.

Clustering or segmentation methods usually precede the\nclassification task and are used as support tools for manual labeling.

Recent work has\nshown that, for certain covariance matrices, the broad class of Preconditioned\nLasso programs provably cannot succeed on polylogarithmically sparse signals\nwith a sublinear number of samples. However, this lower bound only shows that\nfor every preconditioner, there exists at least one signal that it fails to\nrecover successfully.

For\nan appropriate covariance matrix, we construct a single signal distribution on\nwhich any invertibly-preconditioned Lasso program fails with high probability,\nunless it receives a linear number of samples.\nSurprisingly, at the heart of our lower bound is a new positive result in\ncompressed sensing. We show that standard sparse random designs are with high\nprobability robust to adversarial measurement erasures, in the sense that if\n$b$ measurements are erased, then all but $O(b)$ of the coordinates of the\nsignal are still information-theoretically identifiable.

Likewise, the classical laws of distributivity and\ndisjunctive syllogism fail for epistemic modals. Existing attempts to account\nfor these facts generally either under- or over-correct. Some predict that\n$p\\wedge\\Diamond\\neg p$, a so-called epistemic contradiction, is a\ncontradiction only in an etiolated sense, under a notion of entailment that\ndoes not always allow us to replace $p\\wedge\\Diamond\\neg p$ with a\ncontradiction; these theories underpredict the infelicity of embedded epistemic\ncontradictions. Other theories savage classical logic, eliminating not just\nrules that intuitively fail but also rules like non-contradiction, excluded\nmiddle, De Morgan's laws, and disjunction introduction, which intuitively\nremain valid for epistemic modals. In this paper, we aim for a middle ground,\ndeveloping a semantics and logic for epistemic modals that makes epistemic\ncontradictions genuine contradictions and that invalidates distributivity and\ndisjunctive syllogism but that otherwise preserves classical laws that\nintuitively remain valid. We start with an algebraic semantics, based on\northolattices instead of Boolean algebras, and then propose a more concrete\npossibility semantics, based on partial possibilities related by compatibility.\nBoth semantics yield the same consequence relation, which we axiomatize. Then\nwe show how to extend our semantics to explain parallel phenomena involving\nprobabilities and conditionals.

    "abstract": "This paper surveys the trend of leveraging machine learning to solve mixed\ninteger programming (MIP) problems. Theoretically, MIP is an NP-hard problem,\nand most of the combinatorial optimization (CO) problems can be formulated as\nthe MIP. Like other CO problems, the human-designed heuristic algorithms for\nMIP rely on good initial solutions and cost a lot of computational resources.\nTherefore, we consider applying machine learning methods to solve MIP, since\nML-enhanced approaches can provide the solution based on the typical patterns\nfrom the historical data. In this paper, we first introduce the formulation and\npreliminaries of MIP and several traditional algorithms to solve MIP. Then, we\nadvocate further promoting the different integration of machine learning and\nMIP and introducing related learning-based methods, which can be classified\ninto exact algorithms and heuristic algorithms. Finally, we propose the outlook\nfor learning-based MIP solvers, direction towards more combinatorial\noptimization problems beyond MIP, and also the mutual embrace of traditional\nsolvers and machine learning components.",

As image is the\nmost frequently used means of communication in digital scenario, there are\nvarious security methods proposed by researchers from time to time. The review\nis done in two parts. A brief introduction to various optical signal\nprocessing-based methods is provided in the beginning which is followed by a\nconceptual overview of classical DRPE (double random phase encoding) based\noptical encryption schemes. Some of the recently published relevant reviews and\ncryptanalysis articles are also analysed. The second part of review is\nemphasised on the mathematical modelling for encrypting the images in optical\ntransform domain which is main focus of the presented work. Various schemes are\nclassified according to the methodology adopted in each of them. A comparative\nanalysis is presented in tabular form. Based on the observations, the work is\nconverged to a summary on various challenges and some constructive guidelines\nare provided for consideration in future work.

The remaining dynamic non-planar areas are removed as outliers\nand not mapped into the background.

When\nallocating smoothed probability, original label smoothing treats the\nsource-side words that would never appear in the target language equally to the\nreal target-side words, which could bias the translation model. To address this\nissue, we propose Masked Label Smoothing (MLS), a new mechanism that masks the\nsoft label probability of source-side words to zero. Simple yet effective, MLS\nmanages to better integrate label smoothing with vocabulary sharing. Our\nextensive experiments show that MLS consistently yields improvement over\noriginal label smoothing on different datasets, including bilingual and\nmultilingual translation from both translation quality and model's calibration.\nOur code is released at https://github.com/PKUnlp-icler/MLS",

Inspired by the fact that the attended regions of the\none-class token in the standard vision transformer can be leveraged to form a\nclass-agnostic localization map, we investigate if the transformer model can\nalso effectively capture class-specific attention for more discriminative\nobject localization by learning multiple class tokens within the transformer.\nTo this end, we propose a Multi-class Token Transformer, termed as MCTformer,\nwhich uses multiple class tokens to learn interactions between the class tokens\nand the patch tokens. The proposed MCTformer can successfully produce\nclass-discriminative object localization maps from class-to-patch attentions\ncorresponding to different class tokens. We also propose to use a patch-level\npairwise affinity, which is extracted from the patch-to-patch transformer\nattention, to further refine the localization maps.

As for many other generative tasks,\nreinforcement learning (RL) offers the potential to improve the training of MDS\nmodels; yet, it requires a carefully-designed reward that can ensure\nappropriate leverage of both the reference summaries and the input documents.\nFor this reason, in this paper we propose fine-tuning an MDS baseline with a\nreward that balances a reference-based metric such as ROUGE with coverage of\nthe input documents. To implement the approach, we utilize RELAX (Grathwohl et\nal., 2018), a contemporary gradient estimator which is both low-variance and\nunbiased, and we fine-tune the baseline in a few-shot style for both stability\nand computational efficiency. Experimental results over the Multi-News and WCEP\nMDS datasets show significant improvements of up to +0.95 pp average ROUGE\nscore and +3.17 pp METEOR score over the baseline, and competitive results with\nthe literature.

To more effectively coordinate\nbehaviors of neighboring agents, we enhance the mean-field approximation by a\nsupervised policy rectification network (PRN) for rectifying real-time agent\ninteractions and by a learnable compensation term for correcting the\napproximation bias.

    "title": "Exploring Dual-task Correlation for Pose Guided Person Image Generation",
    "abstract": "Pose Guided Person Image Generation (PGPIG) is the task of transforming a\nperson image from the source pose to a given target pose. Most of the existing\nmethods only focus on the ill-posed source-to-target task and fail to capture\nreasonable texture mapping. To address this problem, we propose a novel\nDual-task Pose Transformer Network (DPTN), which introduces an auxiliary task\n(i.e., source-to-source task) and exploits the dual-task correlation to promote\nthe performance of PGPIG. The DPTN is of a Siamese structure, containing a\nsource-to-source self-reconstruction branch, and a transformation branch for\nsource-to-target generation. By sharing partial weights between them, the\nknowledge learned by the source-to-source task can effectively assist the\nsource-to-target learning. Furthermore, we bridge the two branches with a\nproposed Pose Transformer Module (PTM) to adaptively explore the correlation\nbetween features from dual tasks. Such correlation can establish the\nfine-grained mapping of all the pixels between the sources and the targets, and\npromote the source texture transmission to enhance the details of the generated\ntarget images. Extensive experiments show that our DPTN outperforms\nstate-of-the-arts in terms of both PSNR and LPIPS. In addition, our DPTN only\ncontains 9.79 million parameters, which is significantly smaller than other\napproaches.

    "abstract": "Online social media works as a source of various valuable and actionable\ninformation during disasters.

An effective system to\nautomatically identify and categorize these actionable information should be\ncapable to handle multiple languages and under limited supervision.

We conduct computational\nexperiments that allow to empirically estimate the $\\textit{fidelity}$ of\ninterpretability methods and the contribution of perturbation artifacts.

    "abstract": "Token-level adaptive training approaches can alleviate the token imbalance\nproblem and thus improve neural machine translation, through re-weighting the\nlosses of different target tokens based on specific statistical metrics (e.g.,\ntoken frequency or mutual information). Given that standard translation models\nmake predictions on the condition of previous target contexts, we argue that\nthe above statistical metrics ignore target context information and may assign\ninappropriate weights to target tokens. While one possible solution is to\ndirectly take target contexts into these statistical metrics, the\ntarget-context-aware statistical computing is extremely expensive, and the\ncorresponding storage overhead is unrealistic. To solve the above issues, we\npropose a target-context-aware metric, named conditional bilingual mutual\ninformation (CBMI), which makes it feasible to supplement target context\ninformation for statistical metrics. Particularly, our CBMI can be formalized\nas the log quotient of the translation model probability and language model\nprobability by decomposing the conditional joint distribution. Thus CBMI can be\nefficiently calculated during model training without any pre-specific\nstatistical calculations and large storage overhead. Furthermore, we propose an\neffective adaptive training approach based on both the token- and\nsentence-level CBMI.

However, the mathematical model of the defocus process is still\nunclear because several variables in the point spread function are hard to\nmeasure accurately, such as the f-number of cameras, the physical size of a\npixel, the focus depth, etc. In this work, we develop a precise mathematical\nmodel of the camera's point spread function to describe the defocus process. We\nfirst derive the mathematical algorithm for the PSF and extract two parameters\nA and e. A is the composite of camera's f-number, pixel-size, output scale, and\nscaling factor of the circle of confusion; e is the deviation of the focus\ndepth. We design a novel metric based on the defocus histogram to evaluate the\ndifference between the simulated focused image and the actual focused image to\nobtain optimal A and e. We also construct a hardware system consisting of a\nfocusing system and a structured light system to acquire the all-in-focus\nimage, the focused image with corresponding focus depth, and the depth map in\nthe same view. The three types of images, as a dataset, are used to obtain the\nprecise PSF. Our experiments on standard planes and actual objects show that\nthe proposed algorithm can accurately describe the defocus process. The\naccuracy of our algorithm is further proved by evaluating the difference among\nthe actual focused images, the focused image generated by our algorithm, the\nfocused image generated by others.

We sketch\nan alternative according to which representations correspond to inferred latent\nstructures in the world, identified on the basis of conditional patterns of\nactivation. These structures are assumed to have certain properties\nobjectively, which allows for planning, prediction, and detection of unexpected\nevents. We illustrate our proposal with the simulation of a simple neural\nnetwork model. We believe this stronger notion of representation could inform\nfuture research in neuroscience and AI.",

    "abstract": "Legislation and public sentiment throughout the world have promoted fairness\nmetrics, explainability, and interpretability as prescriptions for the\nresponsible development of ethical artificial intelligence systems. Despite the\nimportance of these three pillars in the foundation of the field, they can be\nchallenging to operationalize and attempts to solve the problems in production\nenvironments often feel Sisyphean. This difficulty stems from a number of\nfactors: fairness metrics are computationally difficult to incorporate into\ntraining and rarely alleviate all of the harms perpetrated by these systems.\nInterpretability and explainability can be gamed to appear fair, may\ninadvertently reduce the privacy of personal information contained in training\ndata, and increase user confidence in predictions -- even when the explanations\nare wrong. In this work, we propose a framework for responsibly developing\nartificial intelligence systems by incorporating lessons from the field of\ninformation security and the secure development lifecycle to overcome\nchallenges associated with protecting users in adversarial settings. In\nparticular, we propose leveraging the concepts of threat modeling, design\nreview, penetration testing, and incident response in the context of developing\nAI systems as ways to resolve shortcomings in the aforementioned methods.",

However, in contrast to\nclassical spectral solvers, the proposed scheme works with FE shape functions\nwith local supports and is free of the Fourier ringing phenomenon.

On one hand, female and male brains are structurally almost\nidentical, and while there are sex differences in the endocrine system, these\nare small, while much of gendered identity and behaviour is learned. On the\nother hand, sex differences in some aspects of social behaviour have deep\nevolutionary roots, and are widely present in non-human animals. This\nobservational study recorded the frequency of same-aged, adult human groups\nappearing in public spaces through 2636 hours, recording group formation by\n1.2mn people via 170 research assistants in 46 countries across the world. The\nresults show (a) a significant sex-gender difference in same-sex-same-age\nfrequency, in that ~50% more female-female than male-male pairs are observed in\npublic spaces globally, and (b) that despite regional variation, the patterns\nholds up in every global region.

    "abstract": "Temporal sentence grounding aims to localize a target segment in an untrimmed\nvideo semantically according to a given sentence query. Most previous works\nfocus on learning frame-level features of each whole frame in the entire video,\nand directly match them with the textual information. Such frame-level feature\nextraction leads to the obstacles of these methods in distinguishing ambiguous\nvideo frames with complicated contents and subtle appearance differences, thus\nlimiting their performance. In order to differentiate fine-grained appearance\nsimilarities among consecutive frames, some state-of-the-art methods\nadditionally employ a detection model like Faster R-CNN to obtain detailed\nobject-level features in each frame for filtering out the redundant background\ncontents. However, these methods suffer from missing motion analysis since the\nobject detection module in Faster R-CNN lacks temporal modeling. To alleviate\nthe above limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel Motion- and\nAppearance-guided 3D Semantic Reasoning Network (MA3SRN), which incorporates\noptical-flow-guided motion-aware, detection-based appearance-aware, and\n3D-aware object-level features to better reason the spatial-temporal object\nrelations for accurately modelling the activity among consecutive frames.\nSpecifically, we first develop three individual branches for motion,\nappearance, and 3D encoding separately to learn fine-grained motion-guided,\nappearance-guided, and 3D-aware object features, respectively. Then, both\nmotion and appearance information from corresponding branches are associated to\nenhance the 3D-aware features for the final precise grounding. Extensive\nexperiments on three challenging datasets (ActivityNet Caption, Charades-STA\nand TACoS) demonstrate that the proposed MA3SRN model achieves a new\nstate-of-the-art.",

The receiver maintains estimates of the state of the dynamic\nsource based on the received updates. In this paper, we adopt AoII as the\nperformance metric and investigate the problem of optimizing the transmitter's\naction in each time slot to minimize AoII.

It is not only a more\nchallenging task than regular VQA but also a vital step towards building a\ngeneral VQA system. Most existing knowledge-based VQA systems process knowledge\nand image information similarly and ignore the fact that the knowledge base\n(KB) contains complete information about a triplet, while the extracted image\ninformation might be incomplete as the relations between two objects are\nmissing or wrongly detected. In this paper, we propose a novel model named\ndynamic knowledge memory enhanced multi-step graph reasoning (DMMGR), which\nperforms explicit and implicit reasoning over a key-value knowledge memory\nmodule and a spatial-aware image graph, respectively. Specifically, the memory\nmodule learns a dynamic knowledge representation and generates a\nknowledge-aware question representation at each reasoning step. Then, this\nrepresentation is used to guide a graph attention operator over the\nspatial-aware image graph. Our model achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on\nthe KRVQR and FVQA datasets.

    "abstract": "For image restoration, most existing deep learning based methods tend to\noverfit the training data leading to bad results when encountering unseen\ndegradations out of the assumptions for training. To improve the robustness,\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) prior based methods have been proposed,\nrevealing a promising capability to restore photo-realistic and high-quality\nresults. But these methods suffer from semantic confusion, especially on\nsemantically significant images such as face images. In this paper, we propose\na semantic-aware latent space exploration method for image restoration (SAIR).\nBy explicitly modeling referenced semantics information, SAIR can consistently\nrestore severely degraded images not only to high-resolution highly-realistic\nlooks but also to correct semantics. Quantitative and qualitative experiments\ncollectively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SAIR. Our code can\nbe found in https://github.com/Liamkuo/SAIR.",

PoA has been widely adopted by communities and industries due\nto its better performance and faster finality. In this paper, we explore the\n\\textit{unfairness} issue existing in the current PoA implementations. We have\ninvestigated 2,500+ \\textit{in the wild} projects and selected 10+ as our main\nfocus (covering Ethereum, Binance smart chain, etc.). We have identified two\ntypes of order manipulation attacks to separately break the transaction-level\n(a.k.a. transaction ordering) and the block-level (sealer position ordering)\nfairness. Both of them merely rely on honest-but-\\textit{profitable} sealer\nassumption without modifying original settings. We launch these attacks on the\nforked branches under an isolated environment and carefully evaluate the\nattacking scope towards different implementations. To date (as of Nov 2021),\nthe potentially affected PoA market cap can reach up to $681,087$ million USD.\nBesides, we further dive into the source code of selected projects, and\naccordingly, propose our recommendation for the fix.

    "abstract": "With the assumption that a video dataset is multimodality annotated in which\nauditory and visual modalities both are labeled or class-relevant, current\nmultimodal methods apply modality fusion or cross-modality attention. However,\neffectively leveraging the audio modality in vision-specific annotated videos\nfor action recognition is of particular challenge. To tackle this challenge, we\npropose a novel audio-visual framework that effectively leverages the audio\nmodality in any solely vision-specific annotated dataset. We adopt the language\nmodels (e.g., BERT) to build a semantic audio-video label dictionary (SAVLD)\nthat maps each video label to its most K-relevant audio labels in which SAVLD\nserves as a bridge between audio and video datasets. Then, SAVLD along with a\npretrained audio multi-label model are used to estimate the audio-visual\nmodality relevance during the training phase. Accordingly, a novel learnable\nirrelevant modality dropout (IMD) is proposed to completely drop out the\nirrelevant audio modality and fuse only the relevant modalities. Moreover, we\npresent a new two-stream video Transformer for efficiently modeling the visual\nmodalities. Results on several vision-specific annotated datasets including\nKinetics400 and UCF-101 validated our framework as it outperforms most relevant\naction recognition methods.",

    "abstract": "Delicate industrial insertion tasks (e.g., PC board assembly) remain\nchallenging for industrial robots. The challenges include low error tolerance,\ndelicacy of the components, and large task variations with respect to the\ncomponents to be inserted. To deliver a feasible robotic solution for these\ninsertion tasks, we also need to account for hardware limits of existing\nrobotic systems and minimize the integration effort. This paper proposes a\ncomposable framework for efficient integration of a safe insertion policy on\nexisting robotic platforms to accomplish these insertion tasks. The policy has\nan interpretable modularized design and can be learned efficiently on hardware\nand transferred to new tasks easily. In particular, the policy includes a safe\ninsertion agent as a baseline policy for insertion, an optimal configurable\nCartesian tracker as an interface to robot hardware, a probabilistic inference\nmodule to handle component variety and insertion errors, and a safe learning\nmodule to optimize the parameters in the aforementioned modules to achieve the\nbest performance on designated hardware. The experiment results on a UR10 robot\nshow that the proposed framework achieves safety (for the delicacy of\ncomponents), accuracy (for low tolerance), robustness (against perception error\nand component defection), adaptability and transferability (for task\nvariations), as well as task efficiency during execution plus data and time\nefficiency during learning.",

The\nproposed deep RL method provides real-time computing to support on-line dynamic\nMMGF scheme, and the scheme handles a long-term resilience enhancement problem\nusing adaptive on-line MMGF to defend changeable conditions. The effectiveness\nof the proposed method is validated using a 7-bus system and the IEEE 123-bus\nsystem.

Existing approaches to\naddress risk bounded trajectory optimization problems are limited to particular\nclasses of models and uncertainties such as Gaussian linear problems. In this\npaper, we deal with stochastic nonlinear models, nonlinear safety constraints,\nand arbitrary probabilistic uncertainties, the most general setting ever\nconsidered. To address the risk bounded trajectory optimization problem, we\nfirst formulate the problem as an optimization problem with stochastic dynamics\nequations and chance constraints.

Finally, we\nsolve the resulting deterministic optimization problem using nonlinear\noptimization solvers and get a sequence of control inputs.

    "abstract": "Best-of-N (BoN) Average Displacement Error (ADE)/ Final Displacement Error\n(FDE) is the most used metric for evaluating trajectory prediction models. Yet,\nthe BoN does not quantify the whole generated samples, resulting in an\nincomplete view of the model's prediction quality and performance. We propose a\nnew metric, Average Mahalanobis Distance (AMD) to tackle this issue. AMD is a\nmetric that quantifies how close the whole generated samples are to the ground\ntruth. We also introduce the Average Maximum Eigenvalue (AMV) metric that\nquantifies the overall spread of the predictions. Our metrics are validated\nempirically by showing that the ADE/FDE is not sensitive to distribution\nshifts, giving a biased sense of accuracy, unlike the AMD/AMV metrics.

    "abstract": "Distributed consensus, the ability to reach agreement in the face of\nfailures, is a fundamental primitive for constructing reliable distributed\nsystems. The Paxos algorithm is synonymous with consensus and widely utilized\nin production. Paxos uses two phases: phase one and phase two, each requiring a\nquorum of acceptors, to reach consensus during a round of the protocol.\nTraditionally, Paxos requires that all quorums, regardless of phase or round,\nintersect and majorities are often used for this purpose. Flexible Paxos proved\nthat it is only necessary for phase one quorum of a given round to intersect\nwith the phase two quorums of all previous rounds.\nIn this paper, we re-examine how Paxos approaches the problem of consensus.\nWe look again at quorum intersection in Flexible Paxos and observe that quorum\nintersection can be safely weakened further. Most notably, we observe that if a\nproposer learns that a value was proposed in some previous round then its phase\none no longer needs to intersect with the phase two quorums from that round or\nfrom any previous rounds. Furthermore, in order to provide an intuitive\nexplanation of our results, we propose a novel abstraction for reasoning about\nPaxos which utilizes write-once registers.",

    "abstract": "Attaching attributes (such as color, shape, state, action) to object\ncategories is an important computer vision problem. Attribute prediction has\nseen exciting recent progress and is often formulated as a multi-label\nclassification problem. Yet significant challenges remain in: 1) predicting\ndiverse attributes over multiple categories, 2) modeling attributes-category\ndependency, 3) capturing both global and local scene context, and 4) predicting\nattributes of objects with low pixel-count. To address these issues, we propose\na novel multi-category attribute prediction deep architecture named GlideNet,\nwhich contains three distinct feature extractors. A global feature extractor\nrecognizes what objects are present in a scene, whereas a local one focuses on\nthe area surrounding the object of interest. Meanwhile, an intrinsic feature\nextractor uses an extension of standard convolution dubbed Informed Convolution\nto retrieve features of objects with low pixel-count. GlideNet uses gating\nmechanisms with binary masks and its self-learned category embedding to combine\nthe dense embeddings. Collectively, the Global-Local-Intrinsic blocks\ncomprehend the scene's global context while attending to the characteristics of\nthe local object of interest. Finally, using the combined features, an\ninterpreter predicts the attributes, and the length of the output is determined\nby the category, thereby removing unnecessary attributes. GlideNet can achieve\ncompelling results on two recent and challenging datasets -- VAW and CAR -- for\nlarge-scale attribute prediction. For instance, it obtains more than 5\\% gain\nover state of the art in the mean recall (mR) metric. GlideNet's advantages are\nespecially apparent when predicting attributes of objects with low pixel counts\nas well as attributes that demand global context understanding. Finally, we\nshow that GlideNet excels in training starved real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The problem of human activity recognition from mobile sensor data applies to\nmultiple domains, such as health monitoring, personal fitness, daily life\nlogging, and senior care. A critical challenge for training human activity\nrecognition models is data quality. Acquiring balanced datasets containing\naccurate activity labels requires humans to correctly annotate and potentially\ninterfere with the subjects' normal activities in real-time. Despite the\nlikelihood of incorrect annotation or lack thereof, there is often an inherent\nchronology to human behavior. For example, we take a shower after we exercise.\nThis implicit chronology can be used to learn unknown labels and classify\nfuture activities. In this work, we propose HAR-GCCN, a deep graph CNN model\nthat leverages the correlation between chronologically adjacent sensor\nmeasurements to predict the correct labels for unclassified activities that\nhave at least one activity label. We propose a new training strategy enforcing\nthat the model predicts the missing activity labels by leveraging the known\nones. HAR-GCCN shows superior performance relative to previously used baseline\nmethods, improving classification accuracy by about 25% and up to 68% on\ndifferent datasets.

Using supervised data of real-world 9D\nposes is tedious and erroneous, and also fails to generalize to unseen\nscenarios. Besides, category-level pose estimation requires a method to be able\nto generalize to unseen objects at test time, which is also challenging.\nDrawing inspirations from traditional point pair features (PPFs), in this\npaper, we design a novel Category-level PPF (CPPF) voting method to achieve\naccurate, robust and generalizable 9D pose estimation in the wild. To obtain\nrobust pose estimation, we sample numerous point pairs on an object, and for\neach pair our model predicts necessary SE(3)-invariant voting statistics on\nobject centers, orientations and scales. A novel coarse-to-fine voting\nalgorithm is proposed to eliminate noisy point pair samples and generate final\npredictions from the population. To get rid of false positives in the\norientation voting process, an auxiliary binary disambiguating classification\ntask is introduced for each sampled point pair. In order to detect objects in\nthe wild, we carefully design our sim-to-real pipeline by training on synthetic\npoint clouds only, unless objects have ambiguous poses in geometry. Under this\ncircumstance, color information is leveraged to disambiguate these poses.\nResults on standard benchmarks show that our method is on par with current\nstate of the arts with real-world training data.

The UAV users aim to optimize their\nlocations to maximize the weighted sum rate. While most existing work considers\nsimplified line-of-sight (LoS) or statistic air-to-ground (A2G) channel models,\nwe exploit the location-specific channel knowledge map (CKM) to enhance the\nplacement performance in practice. However, as the CKMs normally contain\ndiscrete site- and location-specific channel data without analytic model\nfunctions, the corresponding weighted sum rate function becomes\nnon-differentiable in general. In this case, conventional optimization\ntechniques relying on function derivatives are inapplicable to solve the\nresultant placement optimization problem. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel iterative algorithm based on the derivative-free optimization. In each\niteration, we first construct a quadratic function to approximate the\nnon-differentiable weighted sum rate under a set of interpolation conditions,\nand then update the UAVs' placement locations by maximizing the approximate\nquadratic function subject to a trust region constraint. Numerical results show\nthe convergence of the proposed algorithm. It is also shown that the proposed\nalgorithm achieves a weighted sum rate close to the optimal design based on\nexhaustive search with much lower implementation complexity, and it\nsignificantly outperforms the conventional optimization method based on\nsimplified LoS channel models and the heuristic design with each UAV hovering\nabove its associated GBS.",

    "abstract": "With the development of social media, various rumors can be easily spread on\nthe Internet and such rumors can have serious negative effects on society.\nThus, it has become a critical task for social media platforms to deal with\nsuspected rumors. However, due to the lack of effective tools, it is often\ndifficult for platform administrators to analyze and validate rumors from a\nlarge volume of information on a social media platform efficiently. We have\nworked closely with social media platform administrators for four months to\nsummarize their requirements of identifying and analyzing rumors, and further\nproposed an interactive visual analytics system, RumorLens, to help them deal\nwith the rumor efficiently and gain an in-depth understanding of the patterns\nof rumor spreading. RumorLens integrates natural language processing (NLP) and\nother data processing techniques with visualization techniques to facilitate\ninteractive analysis and validation of suspected rumors. We propose\nwell-coordinated visualizations to provide users with three levels of details\nof suspected rumors: an overview displays both spatial distribution and\ntemporal evolution of suspected rumors; a projection view leverages a\nmetaphor-based glyph to represent each suspected rumor and further enable users\nto gain a quick understanding of their overall characteristics and similarity\nwith each other; a propagation view visualizes the dynamic spreading details of\na suspected rumor with a novel circular visualization design, and facilitates\ninteractive analysis and validation of rumors in a compact manner.

    "abstract": "We develop new theoretical results on matrix perturbation to shed light on\nthe impact of architecture on the performance of a deep network. In particular,\nwe explain analytically what deep learning practitioners have long observed\nempirically: the parameters of some deep architectures (e.g., residual\nnetworks, ResNets, and Dense networks, DenseNets) are easier to optimize than\nothers (e.g., convolutional networks, ConvNets). Building on our earlier work\nconnecting deep networks with continuous piecewise-affine splines, we develop\nan exact local linear representation of a deep network layer for a family of\nmodern deep networks that includes ConvNets at one end of a spectrum and\nResNets and DenseNets at the other. For regression tasks that optimize the\nsquared-error loss, we show that the optimization loss surface of a modern deep\nnetwork is piecewise quadratic in the parameters, with local shape governed by\nthe singular values of a matrix that is a function of the local linear\nrepresentation. We develop new perturbation results for how the singular values\nof matrices of this sort behave as we add a fraction of the identity and\nmultiply by certain diagonal matrices. A direct application of our perturbation\nresults explains analytically why a ResNet is easier to optimize than a\nConvNet: thanks to its more stable singular values and smaller condition\nnumber, the local loss surface of a ResNet or DenseNet is less erratic, less\neccentric, and features local minima that are more accommodating to\ngradient-based optimization. Our results also shed new light on the impact of\ndifferent nonlinear activation functions on a deep network's singular values,\nregardless of its architecture.",

    "title": "HintNet: Hierarchical Knowledge Transfer Networks for Traffic Accident  Forecasting on Heterogeneous Spatio-Temporal Data",
    "abstract": "Traffic accident forecasting is a significant problem for transportation\nmanagement and public safety. However, this problem is challenging due to the\nspatial heterogeneity of the environment and the sparsity of accidents in space\nand time. The occurrence of traffic accidents is affected by complex\ndependencies among spatial and temporal features. Recent traffic accident\nprediction methods have attempted to use deep learning models to improve\naccuracy. However, most of these methods either focus on small-scale and\nhomogeneous areas such as populous cities or simply use sliding-window-based\nensemble methods, which are inadequate to handle heterogeneity in large\nregions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Hierarchical\nKnowledge Transfer Network (HintNet) model to better capture irregular\nheterogeneity patterns. HintNet performs a multi-level spatial partitioning to\nseparate sub-regions with different risks and learns a deep network model for\neach level using spatio-temporal and graph convolutions. Through knowledge\ntransfer across levels, HintNet archives both higher accuracy and higher\ntraining efficiency. Extensive experiments on a real-world accident dataset\nfrom the state of Iowa demonstrate that HintNet outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods on spatially heterogeneous and large-scale areas.",

When\nis the viewpoint leaked? Can privacy-preserving approaches, e.g., federated or\nindividual training, or using local predicting and predictors with no need for\ntraining avoid viewpoint leakage? In this paper, we investigate viewpoint\nleakage during proactive streaming.

In this work, we address\nthese challenges by designing a set of novel machine learning techniques, which\nform a foundation of a new tool, it IoTelligent, for IoT device management,\nusing traffic characteristics obtained at the network level. The design of our\ntool is driven by the analysis of 1-year long networking data, collected from\n350 companies with IoT deployments. The exploratory analysis of this data\nreveals that IoT environments follow the famous Pareto principle, such as: (i)\n10% of the companies in the dataset contribute to 90% of the entire traffic;\n(ii) 7% of all the companies in the set own 90% of all the devices. We designed\nand evaluated CNN, LSTM, and Convolutional LSTM models for demand forecasting,\nwith a conclusion of the Convolutional LSTM model being the best. However,\nmaintaining and updating individual company models is expensive. In this work,\nwe design a novel, scalable approach, where a general demand forecasting model\nis built using the combined data of all the companies with a normalization\nfactor.

    "abstract": "While deep face recognition (FR) systems have shown amazing performance in\nidentification and verification, they also arouse privacy concerns for their\nexcessive surveillance on users, especially for public face images widely\nspread on social networks. Recently, some studies adopt adversarial examples to\nprotect photos from being identified by unauthorized face recognition systems.\nHowever, existing methods of generating adversarial face images suffer from\nmany limitations, such as awkward visual, white-box setting, weak\ntransferability, making them difficult to be applied to protect face privacy in\nreality. In this paper, we propose adversarial makeup transfer GAN (AMT-GAN), a\nnovel face protection method aiming at constructing adversarial face images\nthat preserve stronger black-box transferability and better visual quality\nsimultaneously. AMT-GAN leverages generative adversarial networks (GAN) to\nsynthesize adversarial face images with makeup transferred from reference\nimages. In particular, we introduce a new regularization module along with a\njoint training strategy to reconcile the conflicts between the adversarial\nnoises and the cycle consistence loss in makeup transfer, achieving a desirable\nbalance between the attack strength and visual changes. Extensive experiments\nverify that compared with state of the arts, AMT-GAN can not only preserve a\ncomfortable visual quality, but also achieve a higher attack success rate over\ncommercial FR APIs, including Face++, Aliyun, and Microsoft.",

    "abstract": "Recently the prompt-tuning paradigm has attracted significant attention. By\nonly tuning continuous prompts with a frozen pre-trained language model (PLM),\nprompt-tuning takes a step towards deploying a shared frozen PLM to serve\nnumerous downstream tasks. Although prompt-tuning shows good performance on\ncertain natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, its effectiveness on\nnatural language generation (NLG) tasks is still under-explored. In this paper,\nwe argue that one of the factors hindering the development of prompt-tuning on\nNLG tasks is the unfamiliar inputs (i.e., inputs are linguistically different\nfrom the pretraining corpus). For example, our preliminary exploration reveals\na large performance gap between prompt-tuning and fine-tuning when unfamiliar\ninputs occur frequently in NLG tasks. This motivates us to propose\ninput-tuning, which fine-tunes both the continuous prompts and the input\nrepresentations, leading to a more effective way to adapt unfamiliar inputs to\nfrozen PLMs. Our proposed input-tuning is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful. Experimental results on seven NLG tasks demonstrate that input-tuning\nis significantly and consistently better than prompt-tuning. Furthermore, on\nthree of these tasks, input-tuning can achieve a comparable or even better\nperformance than fine-tuning.",

Existing methods either rely only on\nsingle-frame information for the detection and segmentation subproblems or\nhandle tracking as a separate post-processing step, which limit their\ncapability to fully leverage and share useful spatial-temporal information for\nall the subproblems. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-neural-network\n(GNN) based method to handle the aforementioned limitation. Specifically, graph\nnodes representing instance features are used for detection and segmentation\nwhile graph edges representing instance relations are used for tracking. Both\ninter and intra-frame information is effectively propagated and shared via\ngraph updates and all the subproblems (i.e. detection, segmentation and\ntracking) are jointly optimized in an unified framework. The performance of our\nmethod shows great improvement on the YoutubeVIS validation dataset compared to\nexisting methods and achieves 35.2% AP with a ResNet-50 backbone, operating at\n22 FPS.

    "abstract": "The high-volume manufacturing of the next generation of semiconductor devices\nrequires advances in measurement signal analysis. Many in the semiconductor\nmanufacturing community have reservations about the adoption of deep learning;\nthey instead prefer other model-based approaches for some image regression\nproblems, and according to the 2021 IEEE International Roadmap for Devices and\nSystems (IRDS) report on Metrology a SEMI standardization committee may endorse\nthis philosophy. The semiconductor manufacturing community does, however,\ncommunicate a need for state-of-the-art statistical analyses to reduce\nmeasurement uncertainty. Prediction intervals which characterize the\nreliability of the predictive performance of regression models can impact\ndecisions, build trust in machine learning, and be applied to other regression\nmodels. However, we are not aware of effective and sufficiently simple\ndistribution-free approaches that offer valid coverage for important classes of\nimage data, so we consider the distribution-free conformal prediction and\nconformalized quantile regression framework.The image regression problem that\nis the focus of this paper pertains to line edge roughness (LER) estimation\nfrom noisy scanning electron microscopy images. LER affects semiconductor\ndevice performance and reliability as well as the yield of the manufacturing\nprocess; the 2021 IRDS emphasizes the crucial importance of LER by devoting a\nwhite paper to it in addition to mentioning or discussing it in the reports of\nmultiple international focus teams.

Besides, theoretical\nanalyses for multi-pass SGD often concern a worst-case instance in a class of\nproblems, which may be pessimistic to explain the superior generalization\nability for some particular problem instance. The goal of this paper is to\nsharply characterize the generalization of multi-pass SGD, by developing an\ninstance-dependent excess risk bound for least squares in the interpolation\nregime, which is expressed as a function of the iteration number, stepsize, and\ndata covariance. We show that the excess risk of SGD can be exactly decomposed\ninto the excess risk of GD and a positive fluctuation error, suggesting that\nSGD always performs worse, instance-wisely, than GD, in generalization. On the\nother hand, we show that although SGD needs more iterations than GD to achieve\nthe same level of excess risk, it saves the number of stochastic gradient\nevaluations, and therefore is preferable in terms of computational time.",

At training time, chatbot generates the response with\nthe golden context, while it has to generate based on the context consisting of\nboth user utterances and the model predicted utterances during real-world\ntesting. With the growth of the number of utterances, this discrepancy becomes\nmore serious in the multi-turn settings. In this paper, we propose a\nhierarchical sampling-based method consisting of both utterance-level sampling\nand semi-utterance-level sampling, to alleviate the discrepancy, which\nimplicitly increases the dialogue coherence. We further adopt reinforcement\nlearning and re-ranking methods to explicitly optimize the dialogue coherence\nduring training and inference, respectively.

Additionally, adaptive\ntracking methods, where target samples collected by the tracker are employed\nfor online learning, have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy. However, single\nobject tracking (SOT) remains a challenging task in real-world application due\nto changes and deformations in a target object's appearance. Learning on all\nthe collected samples may lead to catastrophic forgetting, and thereby corrupt\nthe tracking model.\nIn this paper, SOT is formulated as an online incremental learning problem. A\nnew method is proposed for dynamic sample selection and memory replay,\npreventing template corruption. In particular, we propose a change detection\nmechanism to detect gradual changes in object appearance and select the\ncorresponding samples for online adaption. In addition, an entropy-based sample\nselection strategy is introduced to maintain a diversified auxiliary buffer for\nmemory replay. Our proposed method can be integrated into any object tracking\nalgorithm that leverages online learning for model adaptation.\nExtensive experiments conducted on the OTB-100, LaSOT, UAV123, and\nTrackingNet datasets highlight the cost-effectiveness of our method, along with\nthe contribution of its key components.

    "title": "Find a Way Forward: a Language-Guided Semantic Map Navigator",
    "abstract": "This paper attacks the problem of language-guided navigation in a new\nperspective by using novel semantic navigation maps, which enables robots to\ncarry out natural language instructions and move to a target position based on\nthe map observations. We break down this problem into parts and introduce three\ndifferent modules to solve the corresponding subproblems. Our approach\nleverages map information to provide Deterministic Path Candidate Proposals to\nreduce the solution space. Different from traditional methods that predict\nrobots' movements toward the target step-by-step, we design an attention-based\nLanguage Driven Discriminator to evaluate path candidates and determine the\nbest path as the final result. To represent the map observations along a path\nfor a better modality alignment, a novel Path Feature Encoding scheme tailored\nfor semantic navigation maps is proposed. Unlike traditional methods that tend\nto produce cumulative errors or be stuck in local decisions, our method which\nplans paths based on global information can greatly alleviate these problems.\nThe proposed approach has noticeable performance gains, especially in\nlong-distance navigation cases. Also, its training efficiency is significantly\nhigher than of other methods.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the stochastic bandits problem with $k$ unknown\nheavy-tailed and corrupted reward distributions or arms with time-invariant\ncorruption distributions. At each iteration, the player chooses an arm. Given\nthe arm, the environment returns an uncorrupted reward with probability\n$1-\\varepsilon$ and an arbitrarily corrupted reward with probability\n$\\varepsilon$. In our setting, the uncorrupted reward might be heavy-tailed and\nthe corrupted reward might be unbounded. We prove a lower bound on the regret\nindicating that the corrupted and heavy-tailed bandits are strictly harder than\nuncorrupted or light-tailed bandits. We observe that the environments can be\ncategorised into hardness regimes depending on the suboptimality gap $\\Delta$,\nvariance $\\sigma$, and corruption proportion $\\epsilon$. Following this, we\ndesign a UCB-type algorithm, namely HuberUCB, that leverages Huber's estimator\nfor robust mean estimation. HuberUCB leads to tight upper bounds on regret in\nthe proposed corrupted and heavy-tailed setting. To derive the upper bound, we\nprove a novel concentration inequality for Huber's estimator, which might be of\nindependent interest.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge amalgamation (KA) is a novel deep model reusing task aiming to\ntransfer knowledge from several well-trained teachers to a multi-talented and\ncompact student. Currently, most of these approaches are tailored for\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, there is a tendency that\ntransformers, with a completely different architecture, are starting to\nchallenge the domination of CNNs in many computer vision tasks. Nevertheless,\ndirectly applying the previous KA methods to transformers leads to severe\nperformance degradation. In this work, we explore a more effective KA scheme\nfor transformer-based object detection models. Specifically, considering the\narchitecture characteristics of transformers, we propose to dissolve the KA\ninto two aspects: sequence-level amalgamation (SA) and task-level amalgamation\n(TA). In particular, a hint is generated within the sequence-level amalgamation\nby concatenating teacher sequences instead of redundantly aggregating them to a\nfixed-size one as previous KA works. Besides, the student learns heterogeneous\ndetection tasks through soft targets with efficiency in the task-level\namalgamation. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and COCO have unfolded that\nthe sequence-level amalgamation significantly boosts the performance of\nstudents, while the previous methods impair the students. Moreover, the\ntransformer-based students excel in learning amalgamated knowledge, as they\nhave mastered heterogeneous detection tasks rapidly and achieved superior or at\nleast comparable performance to those of the teachers in their specializations.",

    "abstract": "A federated learning (FL) system first needs to use heterogeneous clients to\nrecruit data, and then perform data training locally on the client to finish\nmodel training for preserving users' data privacy. Yet clients still face the\ncost of computational energy consumption on model training and parameter\ntransmission and are reluctant to join federated learning platform. Thus,\nincentive mechanisms are needed when inviting numerous clients to help train\nthe global model. However, static pricing cannot adjust data size adaptively to\nminimize cost due to client random arrival for participation and incomplete\ninformation about computing cost. Moreover, how to balance data sampling time\nand model training for finite time horizons is under-explored. Therefore, in\nthis paper, a two-phase FL model consisting of the data recruitment phase and\nmodel training phase is formulated to study the clients' incentive mechanism\ndesign under incomplete information about clients' arrivals and their private\ncosts. First, we propose a dynamic pricing scheme for homogeneous clients that\noffer time-dependent monetary returns to clients by considering the tradeoff\nbetween the total payment to clients and the model accuracy loss. We show that\nthe pricing should increase over time in the data-sampling phase due to data\naging. Then we obtain the best time partition between data sampling and\ntraining phases under a closed-form dynamic pricing solution. Further, the\nextension to heterogeneous clients with different data size and working time is\ndiscussed. We prove monotonicity in multiple client-type choice and a linear\nalgorithm is proposed to find the optimal recruitment threshold and client-type\nchoice for total cost minimization. Finally, we present the robustness of our\nalgorithm to data size and examine how the optimal client-type choice changes\nwith different impacting factors.",

    "abstract": "The goal of unpaired image captioning (UIC) is to describe images without\nusing image-caption pairs in the training phase. Although challenging, we\nexcept the task can be accomplished by leveraging a training set of images\naligned with visual concepts. Most existing studies use off-the-shelf\nalgorithms to obtain the visual concepts because the Bounding Box (BBox) labels\nor relationship-triplet labels used for the training are expensive to acquire.\nIn order to resolve the problem in expensive annotations, we propose a novel\napproach to achieve cost-effective UIC. Specifically, we adopt image-level\nlabels for the optimization of the UIC model in a weakly-supervised manner. For\neach image, we assume that only the image-level labels are available without\nspecific locations and numbers. The image-level labels are utilized to train a\nweakly-supervised object recognition model to extract object information (e.g.,\ninstance) in an image, and the extracted instances are adopted to infer the\nrelationships among different objects based on an enhanced graph neural network\n(GNN). The proposed approach achieves comparable or even better performance\ncompared with previous methods without the expensive cost of annotations.\nFurthermore, we design an unrecognized object (UnO) loss combined with a visual\nconcept reward to improve the alignment of the inferred object and relationship\ninformation with the images. It can effectively alleviate the issue encountered\nby existing UIC models about generating sentences with nonexistent objects. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to solve the problem of\nWeakly-Supervised visual concept recognition for UIC (WS-UIC) based only on\nimage-level labels. Extensive experiments have been carried out to demonstrate\nthat the proposed WS-UIC model achieves inspiring results on the COCO dataset\nwhile significantly reducing the cost of labeling.",

    "abstract": "Importance sampling (IS) is valuable in reducing the variance of Monte Carlo\nsampling for many areas, including finance, rare event simulation, and Bayesian\ninference. It is natural and obvious to combine quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods\nwith IS to achieve a faster rate of convergence. However, a naive replacement\nof Monte Carlo with QMC may not work well. This paper investigates the\nconvergence rates of randomized QMC-based IS for estimating integrals with\nrespect to a Gaussian measure, in which the IS measure is also a Gaussian. We\nprove that if the target function satisfies the so-called boundary growth\ncondition and the covariance matrix of the IS density has eigenvalues no\nsmaller than 1, then randomized QMC has a mean error of $O(N^{-1+\\epsilon})$\nfor arbitrarily small $\\epsilon>0$. These sufficient conditions help to assess\nthe effectiveness of IS in QMC. For some particular applications, we find that\nthe Laplace IS, a very general approach to approximate the target function by a\nquadratic Taylor approximation around its mode, has eigenvalues smaller than 1,\nmaking the resulting integrand less favorable for QMC. From this point of view,\na change of measure via Laplace IS may transform a favorable integrand into\nunfavorable one for QMC although the variance of Monte Carlo sampling is\nreduced. We also study the effect of positivization trick on the error rate\nwhen the integrand has mixed sign. If the smooth positivization proposed by\nOwen and Zhou (2000) is used, the rate $O(N^{-1+\\epsilon})$ is retained. This\nis not the case if taking the positive and negative parts of the integrand.

    "abstract": "The legacy mobility robustness optimization (MRO) in self-organizing networks\naims at improving handover performance by optimizing cell-specific handover\nparameters. However, such solutions cannot satisfy the needs of next-generation\nnetwork with network slicing, because it only guarantees the received signal\nstrength but not the per-slice service quality. To provide the truly seamless\nmobility service, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based slice-aware\nmobility robustness optimization (SAMRO) approach, which improves handover\nperformance with per-slice service assurance by optimizing slice-specific\nhandover parameters. Moreover, to allow safe and sample efficient online\ntraining, we develop a two-step transfer learning scheme: 1) regularized\noffline reinforcement learning, and 2) effective online fine-tuning with mixed\nexperience replay. System-level simulations show that compared against the\nlegacy MRO algorithms, SAMRO significantly improves slice-aware service\ncontinuation while optimizing the handover performance.",

In this paper, we tackle the problem of semantic\nsegmentation of artistic paintings, an even more challenging task because of a\nmuch larger diversity in colors, textures, and shapes and because there are no\nground truth annotations available for segmentation. We propose an unsupervised\nmethod for semantic segmentation of paintings using domain adaptation. Our\napproach creates a training set of pseudo-paintings in specific artistic styles\nby using style-transfer on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, and then applies domain\nconfusion between PASCAL VOC 2012 and real paintings. These two steps build on\na new dataset we gathered called DRAM (Diverse Realism in Art Movements)\ncomposed of figurative art paintings from four movements, which are highly\ndiverse in pattern, color, and geometry. To segment new paintings, we present a\ncomposite multi-domain adaptation method that trains on each sub-domain\nseparately and composes their solutions during inference time. Our method\nprovides better segmentation results not only on the specific artistic\nmovements of DRAM, but also on other, unseen ones. We compare our approach to\nalternative methods and show applications of semantic segmentation in art\npaintings.

    "abstract": "Fine-grained image classification is a challenging computer vision task where\nvarious species share similar visual appearances, resulting in\nmisclassification if merely based on visual clues. Therefore, it is helpful to\nleverage additional information, e.g., the locations and dates for data\nshooting, which can be easily accessible but rarely exploited. In this paper,\nwe first demonstrate that existing multimodal methods fuse multiple features\nonly on a single dimension, which essentially has insufficient help in feature\ndiscrimination. To fully explore the potential of multimodal information, we\npropose a dynamic MLP on top of the image representation, which interacts with\nmultimodal features at a higher and broader dimension. The dynamic MLP is an\nefficient structure parameterized by the learned embeddings of variable\nlocations and dates. It can be regarded as an adaptive nonlinear projection for\ngenerating more discriminative image representations in visual tasks. To our\nbest knowledge, it is the first attempt to explore the idea of dynamic networks\nto exploit multimodal information in fine-grained image classification tasks.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The t-SNE\nalgorithm visually indicates that our technique improves the recognizability of\nimage representations that are visually similar but with different categories.\nFurthermore, among published works across multiple fine-grained datasets,\ndynamic MLP consistently achieves SOTA results\nhttps://paperswithcode.com/dataset/inaturalist and takes third place in the\niNaturalist challenge at FGVC8\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/c/inaturalist-2021/leaderboard.

For providing easy message\npropagation primitives, the mutual-exclusive propagation (MEP) of one-bit\nmessages is investigated with a simplified discrete system model. Inspired by\nnatural propagation systems, efficient self-stabilizing periodic MEP processes\nare proposed with the MEP systems. For handling the worst-case scenarios, the\nMEP systems are generally analyzed with formal proofs upon arbitrarily\nconnected networks. It shows that the MEP systems can be stabilized with\narbitrary initial system states within a short bounded time. Meanwhile, the\nnumeric simulation shows that the propagation errors can be significantly\nreduced if the message delays are randomly distributed. Propagation patterns\nare also discussed in further deriving finer propagation results in the MEP\nsystems. It shows that bounded clock drifts and some benign faults can be well\nhandled in the MEP systems. Featured by its very simple mechanism, the proposed\nMEP primitive can be employed as a practical building block of upper-layer\nself-stabilizing synchronous systems.",

Unlike prevailing single-purpose models\nthat overspecialize at individual tasks and learn from scratch when being\nextended to new tasks, our approach is general-purpose with the ability of\nstitching together existing skills to learn new tasks more effectively.\nDifferent from traditional dense models that always activate all the model\nparameters, our approach is sparsely activated: only relevant parts of the\nmodel (like pathways through the network) are activated.\nWe take natural language understanding as a case study and define a set of\nskills like \\textit{the skill of understanding the sentiment of text} and\n\\textit{the skill of understanding natural language questions}. These skills\ncan be reused and combined to support many different tasks and situations. We\ndevelop our system using Transformer as the backbone.

    "abstract": "Human gaze is a crucial cue used in various applications such as human-robot\ninteraction and virtual reality. Recently, convolution neural network (CNN)\napproaches have made notable progress in predicting gaze direction. However,\nestimating gaze in-the-wild is still a challenging problem due to the\nuniqueness of eye appearance, lightning conditions, and the diversity of head\npose and gaze directions. In this paper, we propose a robust CNN-based model\nfor predicting gaze in unconstrained settings. We propose to regress each gaze\nangle separately to improve the per-angel prediction accuracy, which will\nenhance the overall gaze performance. In addition, we use two identical losses,\none for each angle, to improve network learning and increase its\ngeneralization. We evaluate our model with two popular datasets collected with\nunconstrained settings. Our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy\nof 3.92{\\deg} and 10.41{\\deg} on MPIIGaze and Gaze360 datasets, respectively.\nWe make our code open source at https://github.com/Ahmednull/L2CS-Net.",

    "abstract": "Tensor Core is a mixed-precision matrix-matrix multiplication unit on NVIDIA\nGPUs with a theoretical peak performance of more than 300 TFlop/s on Ampere\narchitectures. Tensor Cores were developed in response to the high demand of\ndense matrix multiplication from machine learning. However, many applications\nin scientific computing such as preconditioners for iterative solvers and\nlow-precision Fourier transforms can exploit these Tensor Cores. To compute a\nmatrix multiplication on Tensor Cores, we need to convert input matrices to\nhalf-precision, which results in loss of accuracy. To avoid this, we can keep\nthe mantissa loss in the conversion using additional half-precision variables\nand use them for correcting the accuracy of matrix-matrix multiplication. Even\nwith this correction, the use of Tensor Cores yields higher throughput compared\nto FP32 SIMT Cores. Nevertheless, the correcting capability of this method\nalone is limited, and the resulting accuracy cannot match that of a matrix\nmultiplication on FP32 SIMT Cores. We address this problem and develop a high\naccuracy, high performance, and low power consumption matrix-matrix\nmultiplication implementation using Tensor Cores, which exactly matches the\naccuracy of FP32 SIMT Cores while achieving superior throughput. The\nimplementation is based on NVIDIA's CUTLASS. We found that the key to achieving\nthis accuracy is how to deal with the rounding inside Tensor Cores and\nunderflow probability during the correction computation. Our implementation\nachieves 51TFlop/s for a limited exponent range using FP16 Tensor Cores and\n33TFlop/s for full exponent range of FP32 using TF32 Tensor Cores on NVIDIA\nA100 GPUs, which outperforms the theoretical FP32 SIMT Core peak performance of\n19.5TFlop/s.",

An\neffective encoding of such skills can be only achieved if the underlying\ngeometric structure of the skill manifold is considered and the constrains\narising from this structure are fulfilled during both learning and execution.\nHowever, typical learned skill models such as dynamic movement primitives\n(DMPs) are limited to Euclidean data and fail in correctly embedding quantities\nwith geometric constraints.

    "abstract": "Wireless x-haul networks rely on microwave and millimeter-wave links between\n4G and/or 5G base-stations to support ultra-high data rate and ultra-low\nlatency. A major challenge associated with these high frequency links is their\nsusceptibility to weather conditions. In particular, precipitation may cause\nsevere signal attenuation, which significantly degrades the network\nperformance. In this paper, we develop a Predictive Network Reconfiguration\n(PNR) framework that uses historical data to predict the future condition of\neach link and then prepares the network ahead of time for imminent\ndisturbances. The PNR framework has two components: (i) an Attenuation\nPrediction (AP) mechanism; and (ii) a Multi-Step Network Reconfiguration (MSNR)\nalgorithm. The AP mechanism employs an encoder-decoder Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM) model to predict the sequence of future attenuation levels of each link.\nThe MSNR algorithm leverages these predictions to dynamically optimize routing\nand admission control decisions aiming to maximize network utilization, while\npreserving max-min fairness among the base-stations sharing the network and\npreventing transient congestion that may be caused by re-routing. We train,\nvalidate, and evaluate the PNR framework using a dataset containing over 2\nmillion measurements collected from a real-world city-scale backhaul network.\nThe results show that the framework: (i) predicts attenuation with high\naccuracy, with an RMSE of less than 0.4 dB for a prediction horizon of 50\nseconds; and (ii) can improve the instantaneous network utilization by more\nthan 200% when compared to reactive network reconfiguration algorithms that\ncannot leverage information about future disturbances.",

In this paper, we show that by modelling floor plans as sequences\nof line segments seen from a particular point of view, recent advances in\nautoregressive sequence modelling can be leveraged to model and predict floor\nplans. The line segments are canonicalized and translated to sequence of tokens\nand an attention-based neural network is used to fit a one-step distribution\nover next tokens. We fit the network to sequences derived from a set of\nlarge-scale floor plans, and demonstrate the capabilities of the model in four\nscenarios: novel floor plan generation, completion of partially observed floor\nplans, generation of floor plans from simulated sensor data, and finally, the\napplicability of a floor plan model in predicting the shortest distance with\npartial knowledge of the environment.",

    "abstract": "As a popular comic style, manga offers a unique impression by utilizing a\nrich set of bitonal patterns, or screentones, for illustration. However,\nscreentones can easily be contaminated with visual-unpleasant aliasing and/or\nblurriness after resampling, which harms its visualization on displays of\ndiverse resolutions. To address this problem, we propose the first manga\nretargeting method that synthesizes a rescaled manga image while retaining the\nscreentone in each screened region. This is a non-trivial task as accurate\nregion-wise segmentation remains challenging. Fortunately, the rescaled manga\nshares the same region-wise screentone correspondences with the original manga,\nwhich enables us to simplify the screentone synthesis problem as an\nanchor-based proposals selection and rearrangement problem. Specifically, we\ndesign a novel manga sampling strategy to generate aliasing-free screentone\nproposals, based on hierarchical grid-based anchors that connect the\ncorrespondences between the original and the target rescaled manga.\nFurthermore, a Recurrent Proposal Selection Module (RPSM) is proposed to\nadaptively integrate these proposals for target screentone synthesis. Besides,\nto deal with the translation insensitivity nature of screentones, we propose a\ntranslation-invariant screentone loss to facilitate the training convergence.\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted to verify the\neffectiveness of our method, and notably compelling results are achieved\ncompared to existing alternative techniques.",

    "abstract": "Semiring semantics evaluates logical statements by values in some commutative\nsemiring K. Random semiring interpretations, induced by a probability\ndistribution on K, generalise random structures, and we investigate here the\nquestion of how classical results on first-order logic on random structures,\nmost importantly the 0-1 laws of Glebskii et al. and Fagin, generalise to\nsemiring semantics. For positive semirings, the classical 0-1 law implies that\nevery first-order sentence is, asymptotically, either almost surely evaluated\nto 0 by random semiring interpretations, or almost surely takes only values\ndifferent from 0. However, by means of a more sophisticated analysis, based on\nappropriate extension properties and on algebraic representations of\nfirst-order formulae, we can prove much stronger results.\nFor many semirings K, the first-order sentences can be partitioned into\nclasses F(j) for all semiring values j in K, such that every sentence in F(j)\nevaluates almost surely to j under random semiring interpretations. Further,\nfor finite or infinite lattice semirings, this partition actually collapses to\njust three classes F(0), F(1), and F(e), of sentences that, respectively,\nalmost surely evaluate to 0, 1, and to the smallest non-zero value e. The\nproblem of computing the almost sure valuation of a first-order sentence on\nfinite lattice semirings is PSPACE-complete.\nAn important semiring where the analysis is somewhat different is the\nsemiring of natural numbers. Here, both addition and multiplication are\nincreasing with respect to the natural semiring order and the classes F(j), for\nnatural numbers j, no longer cover all FO-sentences, but have to be extended by\nthe class of sentences that almost surely evaluate to unboundedly large values.",

    "abstract": "A variety of control tasks such as inverse kinematics (IK), trajectory\noptimization (TO), and model predictive control (MPC) are commonly formulated\nas energy minimization problems. Numerical solutions to such problems are\nwell-established. However, these are often too slow to be used directly in\nreal-time applications. The alternative is to learn solution manifolds for\ncontrol problems in an offline stage. Although this distillation process can be\ntrivially formulated as a behavioral cloning (BC) problem in an imitation\nlearning setting, our experiments highlight a number of significant\nshortcomings arising due to incompatible local minima, interpolation artifacts,\nand insufficient coverage of the state space. In this paper, we propose an\nalternative to BC that is efficient and numerically robust. We formulate the\nlearning of solution manifolds as a minimization of the energy terms of a\ncontrol objective integrated over the space of problems of interest. We\nminimize this energy integral with a novel method that combines Monte\nCarlo-inspired adaptive sampling strategies with the derivatives used to solve\nindividual instances of the control task. We evaluate the performance of our\nformulation on a series of robotic control problems of increasing complexity,\nand we highlight its benefits through comparisons against traditional methods\nsuch as behavioral cloning and Dataset aggregation (Dagger).",

    "abstract": "To improve users' experience as they navigate the myriad of options offered\nby online marketplaces, it is essential to have well-organized product\ncatalogs. One key ingredient to that is the availability of product attributes\nsuch as color or material. However, on some marketplaces such as\nRakuten-Ichiba, which we focus on, attribute information is often incomplete or\neven missing. One promising solution to this problem is to rely on deep models\npre-trained on large corpora to predict attributes from unstructured data, such\nas product descriptive texts and images (referred to as modalities in this\npaper). However, we find that achieving satisfactory performance with this\napproach is not straightforward but rather the result of several refinements,\nwhich we discuss in this paper. We provide a detailed description of our\napproach to attribute extraction, from investigating strong single-modality\nmethods, to building a solid multimodal model combining textual and visual\ninformation. One key component of our multimodal architecture is a novel\napproach to seamlessly combine modalities, which is inspired by our\nsingle-modality investigations. In practice, we notice that this new\nmodality-merging method may suffer from a modality collapse issue, i.e., it\nneglects one modality. Hence, we further propose a mitigation to this problem\nbased on a principled regularization scheme. Experiments on Rakuten-Ichiba data\nprovide empirical evidence for the benefits of our approach, which has been\nalso successfully deployed to Rakuten-Ichiba. We also report results on\npublicly available datasets showing that our model is competitive compared to\nseveral recent multimodal and unimodal baselines.",

    "abstract": "Despite the tremendous empirical success of deep learning models to solve\nvarious learning tasks, our theoretical understanding of their generalization\nability is very limited. Classical generalization bounds based on tools such as\nthe VC dimension or Rademacher complexity, are so far unsuitable for deep\nmodels and it is doubtful that these techniques can yield tight bounds even in\nthe most idealistic settings (Nagarajan & Kolter, 2019). In this work, we\ninstead revisit the concept of leave-one-out (LOO) error to measure the\ngeneralization ability of deep models in the so-called kernel regime. While\npopular in statistics, the LOO error has been largely overlooked in the context\nof deep learning. By building upon the recently established connection between\nneural networks and kernel learning, we leverage the closed-form expression for\nthe leave-one-out error, giving us access to an efficient proxy for the test\nerror. We show both theoretically and empirically that the leave-one-out error\nis capable of capturing various phenomena in generalization theory, such as\ndouble descent, random labels or transfer learning. Our work therefore\ndemonstrates that the leave-one-out error provides a tractable way to estimate\nthe generalization ability of deep neural networks in the kernel regime,\nopening the door to potential, new research directions in the field of\ngeneralization.",

    "abstract": "As autonomous and semi-autonomous agents become more integrated with society,\nvalidation of their safety is increasingly important. The scenarios under which\nthey are used, however, can be quite complicated; as such, formal verification\nmay be impossible. To this end, simulation-based safety verification is being\nused more frequently to understand failure scenarios for the most complex\nproblems. Recent approaches, such as adaptive stress testing (AST), use\nreinforcement learning, making them prone to excessive exploitation of known\nfailures, limiting coverage of the space of failures. To overcome this, the\nwork below defines a class of Markov decision processes, the knowledge MDP,\nwhich captures information about the learned model to reason over. More\nspecifically, by leveraging, the \"knows what it knows\" (KWIK) framework, the\nlearner estimates its knowledge (model estimates and confidence, as well as\nassumptions) about the underlying system. This formulation is vetted through\nMF-KWIK-AST which extends bidirectional learning in multiple fidelities (MF) of\nsimulators to the safety verification problem. The knowledge MDP formulation is\napplied to detect convergence of the model, penalizing this behavior to\nencourage further exploration. Results are evaluated in a grid world, training\nan adversary to intercept a system under test. Monte Carlo trials compare the\nrelative sample efficiency of MF-KWIK-AST to learning with a single-fidelity\nsimulator, as well as demonstrate the utility of incorporating knowledge about\nlearned models into the decision making process.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has focused on data-driven learning of the evolution of unknown\nsystems via deep neural networks (DNNs), with the goal of conducting long time\nprediction of the evolution of the unknown system. Training a DNN with low\ngeneralization error is a particularly important task in this case as error is\naccumulated over time. Because of the inherent randomness in DNN training,\nchiefly in stochastic optimization, there is uncertainty in the resulting\nprediction, and therefore in the generalization error. Hence, the\ngeneralization error can be viewed as a random variable with some probability\ndistribution. Well-trained DNNs, particularly those with many hyperparameters,\ntypically result in probability distributions for generalization error with low\nbias but high variance. High variance causes variability and unpredictably in\nthe results of a trained DNN. This paper presents a computational technique\nwhich decreases the variance of the generalization error, thereby improving the\nreliability of the DNN model to generalize consistently. In the proposed\nensemble averaging method, multiple models are independently trained and model\npredictions are averaged at each time step. A mathematical foundation for the\nmethod is presented, including results regarding the distribution of the local\ntruncation error. In addition, three time-dependent differential equation\nproblems are considered as numerical examples, demonstrating the effectiveness\nof the method to decrease variance of DNN predictions generally.",

Similarly, formulating and comprehending written queries can be\nconfusing, especially for undergraduate students. One of the pivotal reasons\ngiven for these difficulties lies with the simple syntax of SQL, which is often\nmisleading and hard to understand. An ideal solution is to present these two\naudiences: undergraduate students and nontechnical end-users with learning and\npractice tools. These tools are mostly electronic and can be used to aid their\nunderstanding, as well as enable them to write correct SQL queries. This work\nproposes a new approach aimed at understanding and writing correct SQL queries\nusing principles from Formal Language and Automata Theory. We present\nalgorithms based on: regular expressions for the recognition of simple query\nconstructs, context-free grammars for the recognition of nested queries, and a\njumping finite automaton for the synthesis of SQL queries from natural language\ndescriptions. As proof of concept, these algorithms were further implemented\ninto interactive software tools aimed at improving SQL comprehension.\nEvaluation of these tools showed that the majority of participants agreed that\nthe tools were intuitive and aided their understanding of SQL queries.

    "abstract": "Multi-label zero-shot learning extends conventional single-label zero-shot\nlearning to a more realistic scenario that aims at recognizing multiple unseen\nlabels of classes for each input sample. Existing works usually exploit\nattention mechanism to generate the correlation among different labels.\nHowever, most of them are usually biased on several major classes while neglect\nmost of the minor classes with the same importance in input samples, and may\nthus result in overly diffused attention maps that cannot sufficiently cover\nminor classes. We argue that disregarding the connection between major and\nminor classes, i.e., correspond to the global and local information,\nrespectively, is the cause of the problem. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework of unbiased multi-label zero-shot learning, by considering various\nclass-specific regions to calibrate the training process of the classifier.\nSpecifically, Pyramid Feature Attention (PFA) is proposed to build the\ncorrelation between global and local information of samples to balance the\npresence of each class. Meanwhile, for the generated semantic representations\nof input samples, we propose Semantic Attention (SA) to strengthen the\nelement-wise correlation among these vectors, which can encourage the\ncoordinated representation of them. Extensive experiments on the large-scale\nmulti-label zero-shot benchmarks NUS-WIDE and Open-Image demonstrate that the\nproposed method surpasses other representative methods by significant margins.",

    "abstract": "Complex, real-world domains may not be fully modeled for an agent, especially\nif the agent has never operated in the domain before. The agent's ability to\neffectively plan and act in such a domain is influenced by its knowledge of\nwhen it can perform specific actions and the effects of those actions. We\ndescribe a novel exploratory planning agent that is capable of learning action\npreconditions and effects without expert traces or a given goal. The agent's\narchitecture allows it to perform both exploratory actions as well as\ngoal-directed actions, which opens up important considerations for how\nexploratory planning and goal planning should be controlled, as well as how the\nagent's behavior should be explained to any teammates it may have. The\ncontributions of this work include a new representation for contexts called\nLifted Linked Clauses, a novel exploration action selection approach using\nthese clauses, an exploration planner that uses lifted linked clauses as goals\nin order to reach new states, and an empirical evaluation in a scenario from an\nexploration-focused video game demonstrating that lifted linked clauses improve\nexploration and action model learning against non-planning baseline agents.",

Operator migration\nis a complex process that involves changes in the state and stream management\nof a running query, typically without any loss of data, and with as little\ndisruption to the execution as possible. This survey provides an overview of\nsolutions for operator migration from a historical perspective as well as the\nperspective of the goal of migration.

Existing work in the area is analyzed to separate the mechanism of\nmigration from the decision to migrate the data. In case of the latter, a\ncost-benefit analysis is emphasized that is important for operator migration\nbut is often only implicitly addressed, or is neglected altogether.

Currently, in the field of heuristic optimisation, such\nspecification is rarely mentioned or investigated due to the assumed triviality\nor insignificance of this question. Here, we demonstrate that, at least in\nalgorithms based on Differential Evolution, this choice induces notably\ndifferent behaviours - in terms of performance, disruptiveness and population\ndiversity. This is shown theoretically (where possible) for standard\nDifferential Evolution in the absence of selection pressure and experimentally\nfor the standard and state-of-the-art Differential Evolution variants on\nspecial test function $f_0$ and BBOB benchmarking suite, respectively.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that the importance of this choice quickly grows with\nproblem's dimensionality. Different Evolution is not at all special in this\nregard - there is no reason to presume that other heuristic optimisers are not\nequally affected by the aforementioned algorithmic choice. Thus, we urge the\nfield of heuristic optimisation to formalise and adopt the idea of a new\nalgorithmic component in heuristic optimisers, which we call here a strategy of\ndealing with infeasible solutions. This component needs to be consistently (a)\nspecified in algorithmic descriptions to guarantee reproducibility of results,\n(b) studied to better understand its impact on algorithm's performance in a\nwider sense and (c) included in the (automatic) algorithmic design.

High stiffness, large range of\nmotion with high force capability are achieved with the proposed mechanism,\nwhich are in trade-off relationships in traditional haptic interfaces.

These robots often rely on 2D occupancy maps for core tasks such\nas localisation and motion and task planning. However, reliable identification\nof structure and room segmentation from 2D occupancy maps is still an open\nproblem due to clutter (e.g., furniture and movable object), occlusions, and\npartial coverage. We propose a method for the RObust StructurE identification\nand ROom SEgmentation (ROSE^2 ) of 2D occupancy maps, which may be cluttered\nand incomplete. ROSE^2 identifies the main directions of walls and is resilient\nto clutter and partial observations, allowing to extract a clean, abstract\ngeometrical floor-plan-like description of the environment, which is used to\nsegment, i.e., to identify rooms in, the original occupancy grid map. ROSE^2 is\ntested in several real-world publicly-available cluttered maps obtained in\ndifferent conditions. The results show how it can robustly identify the\nenvironment structure in 2D occupancy maps suffering from clutter and partial\nobservations, while significantly improving room segmentation accuracy.

The inability\nof filter list authors to evaluate the Web compatibility impact of a new rule\nbefore shipping it severely reduces the benefits of filter-list-based content\nblocking: filter lists are both overly-conservative (i.e. rules are tailored\nnarrowly to reduce the risk of breaking things) and error-prone (i.e. blocking\ntools still break large numbers of sites).

Unfortunately, all previous approaches\nfor achieving this suffer from myopic evaluation, considering only a few or a\nfinite number of updates to the policies of other agents.

Specifically, we develop a new\noptimization objective that maximizes each agent's average reward by directly\naccounting for the impact of its behavior on the limiting set of policies that\nother agents will take on.

We propose an\nAI-based approach for the detection of potential pharmaceutical safety signals\nfrom patients' reviews that can be used as part of the pharmacovigilance\nsurveillance process to flag the necessity of an in-depth pharmacovigilance\ninvestigation. We focus on the Levothyrox case in France which triggered huge\nattention from the media following the change of the medication formula,\nleading to an increase in the frequency of adverse drug reactions normally\nreported by patients. Our approach is two-fold. (1) We investigate various\nNLP-based indicators extracted from patients' reviews including words and\nn-grams frequency, semantic similarity, Adverse Drug Reactions mentions, and\nsentiment analysis. (2) We propose a deep learning architecture, named Word\nCloud Convolutional Neural Network (WC-CNN) which trains a CNN on word clouds\nextracted from the patients comments. We study the effect of different time\nresolutions and different NLP pre-processing techniques on the model\nperformance. Our results show that the proposed indicators could be used in the\nfuture to effectively detect new safety signals. The WC-CNN model trained on\nword clouds extracted at monthly resolution outperforms the others with an\naccuracy of 75%.",

These methods are entirely based on generating\ncounterfactuals for the given training and test set instances. Counterfactual\ninstances are commonly prepared by replacing sensitive identity terms, i.e.,\nthe identity terms present in the instance are replaced with other identity\nterms that fall under the same sensitive category. Therefore, the efficacy of\nthese methods depends heavily on the quality and comprehensiveness of identity\npairs. In this paper, we offer a two-step data augmentation process where (1)\nthe former stage consists of a novel method for preparing a comprehensive list\nof identity pairs with word embeddings, and (2) the latter consists of\nleveraging prepared identity pairs list to enhance the training instances by\napplying three simple operations (namely identity pair replacement, identity\nterm blindness, and identity pair swap).

However, they are not suitable for nested and overlapping spans with\nlarge ontologies and for predicting the position of the entities. To fill this\ngap, we introduce a new model for NER task -- an RNN transducer (RNN-T). These\nmodels are trained using paired input and output sequences without explicitly\nspecifying the alignment between them, similar to other seq-to-seq models.\nRNN-T models learn the alignment using a loss function that sums over all\nalignments. In NER tasks, however, the alignment between words and target\nlabels are available from the human annotations. We propose a fixed alignment\nRNN-T model that utilizes the given alignment, while preserving the benefits of\nRNN-Ts such as modeling output dependencies. As a more general case, we also\npropose a constrained alignment model where users can specify a relaxation of\nthe given input alignment and the model will learn an alignment within the\ngiven constraints. In other words, we propose a family of seq-to-seq models\nwhich can leverage alignments between input and target sequences when\navailable. Through empirical experiments on a challenging real-world medical\nNER task with multiple nested ontologies, we demonstrate that our fixed\nalignment model outperforms the standard RNN-T model, improving F1-score from\n0.70 to 0.74.",

    "abstract": "Momentive offers solutions in market research, customer experience, and\nenterprise feedback. The technology is gleaned from the billions of real\nresponses to questions asked on the platform. However, people may create biased\nquestions. A double-barreled question (DBQ) is a common type of biased question\nthat asks two aspects in one question. For example, \"Do you agree with the\nstatement: The food is yummy, and the service is great.\". This DBQ confuses\nsurvey respondents because there are two parts in a question. DBQs impact both\nthe survey respondents and the survey owners. Momentive aims to detect DBQs and\nrecommend survey creators to make a change towards gathering high quality\nunbiased survey data. Previous research work has suggested detecting DBQs by\nchecking the existence of grammatical conjunction. While this is a simple\nrule-based approach, this method is error-prone because conjunctions can also\nexist in properly constructed questions. We present an end-to-end machine\nlearning approach for DBQ classification in this work. We handled this\nimbalanced data using active learning, and compared state-of-the-art embedding\nalgorithms to transform text data into vectors. Furthermore, we proposed a\nmodel interpretation technique propagating the vector-level SHAP values to a\nSHAP value for each word in the questions. We concluded that the word2vec\nsubword embedding with maximum pooling is the optimal word embedding\nrepresentation in terms of precision and running time in the offline\nexperiments using the survey data at Momentive. The A/B test and production\nmetrics indicate that this model brings a positive change to the business. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first machine learning framework for DBQ\ndetection, and it successfully differentiates Momentive from the competitors.\nWe hope our work sheds light on machine learning approaches for bias question\ndetection.",

However, if one observes the\nstate of the system only partially, the observed quantities (outputs) and the\ninputs of the system can typically be related by more complicated\ndifferential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Therefore, a natural question\n(referred to as the realizability problem) is: given a differential-algebraic\nequation (say, fitted from data), does it come from a partially observed\ndynamical system? A special case in which the functions involved in the\ndynamical system are rational is of particular interest. For a single\ndifferential-algebraic equation in a single output variable, Forsman has shown\nthat it is realizable by a rational dynamical system if and only if the\ncorresponding hypersurface is unirational, and he turned this into an algorithm\nin the first-order case.\nIn this paper, we study a more general case of single-input-single-output\nequations. We show that if a realization by a rational dynamical system exists,\nthe system can be taken to have the dimension equal to the order of the DAE.

In addition, this hybrid quantum-classical model for the first time\nachieves quantum-inspired blur convolution similar to classical depthwise\nconvolution and also successfully applies quantum progressive training with\nquantum circuits, both of which guarantee that our model is the quantum\ncounterpart of the famous style-based GAN. The results state that the\nfidelities of random generating spike protein variation structure are always\nbeyond 96% for Delta, 94% for Omicron. The training loss curve is more stable\nand converges better with multiple loss functions compared with the\ncorresponding classical algorithm. At last, evidences that quantum-inspired\nalgorithms promote the classical deep learning and hybrid models effectively\npredict the mutant strains are strong.",

    "title": "OCR quality affects perceived usefulness of historical newspaper  clippings -- a user study",
    "abstract": "Effects of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) quality on historical\ninformation retrieval have so far been studied in data-oriented scenarios\nregarding the effectiveness of retrieval results. Such studies have either\nfocused on the effects of artificially degraded OCR quality (see, e.g., [1-2])\nor utilized test collections containing texts based on authentic low quality\nOCR data (see, e.g., [3]). In this paper the effects of OCR quality are studied\nin a user-oriented information retrieval setting. Thirty-two users evaluated\nsubjectively query results of six topics each (out of 30 topics) based on\npre-formulated queries using a simulated work task setting. To the best of our\nknowledge our simulated work task experiment is the first one showing\nempirically that users' subjective relevance assessments of retrieved documents\nare affected by a change in the quality of optically read text. Users of\nhistorical newspaper collections have so far commented effects of OCR'ed data\nquality mainly in impressionistic ways, and controlled user environments for\nstudying effects of OCR quality on users' relevance assessments of the\nretrieval results have so far been missing. To remedy this The National Library\nof Finland (NLF) set up an experimental query environment for the contents of\none Finnish historical newspaper, Uusi Suometar 1869-1918, to be able to\ncompare users' evaluation of search results of two different OCR qualities for\ndigitized newspaper articles. The query interface was able to present the same\nunderlying document for the user based on two alternatives: either based on the\nlower OCR quality, or based on the higher OCR quality, and the choice was\nrandomized. The users did not know about quality differences in the article\ntexts they evaluated. The main result of the study is that improved optical\ncharacter recognition quality affects perceived usefulness of historical\nnewspaper articles significantly. The mean average evaluation score for the\nimproved OCR results was 7.94% higher than the mean average evaluation score of\nthe old OCR results.",

Through experiments\nand user feedback we showcase our preliminary findings of the pilot-system\nresponse. Results suggest that the HMI is capable of effectively telelocomoting\nSATYRR, that pilot preferences should dictate the appropriate motion mapping\nand gains, and finally that the pilot can better learn to control the system\nover time.

    "abstract": "News Recommendation System(NRS) has become a fundamental technology to many\nonline news services. Meanwhile, several studies show that recommendation\nsystems(RS) are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, and the attackers have\nthe ability to mislead the system to perform as their desires. A widely studied\nattack approach, injecting fake users, can be applied on the NRS when the NRS\nis treated the same as the other systems whose items are fixed. However, in the\nNRS, as each item (i.e. news) is more informative, we propose a novel approach\nto poison the NRS, which is to perturb contents of some browsed news that\nresults in the manipulation of the rank of the target news. Intuitively, an\nattack is useless if it is highly likely to be caught, i.e., exposed. To\naddress this, we introduce a notion of the exposure risk and propose a novel\nproblem of attacking a history news dataset by means of perturbations where the\ngoal is to maximize the manipulation of the target news rank while keeping the\nrisk of exposure under a given budget. We design a reinforcement learning\nframework, called TDP-CP, which contains a two-stage hierarchical model to\nreduce the searching space. Meanwhile, influence estimation is also applied to\nsave the time on retraining the NRS for rewards. We test the performance of\nTDP-CP under three NRSs and on different target news. Our experiments show that\nTDP-CP can increase the rank of the target news successfully with a limited\nexposure budget.",

    "abstract": "There has been a recent surge in learning generative models for graphs. While\nimpressive progress has been made on static graphs, work on generative modeling\nof temporal graphs is at a nascent stage with significant scope for\nimprovement. First, existing generative models do not scale with either the\ntime horizon or the number of nodes. Second, existing techniques are\ntransductive in nature and thus do not facilitate knowledge transfer. Finally,\ndue to relying on one-to-one node mapping from source to the generated graph,\nexisting models leak node identity information and do not allow\nup-scaling/down-scaling the source graph size. In this paper, we bridge these\ngaps with a novel generative model called TIGGER. TIGGER derives its power\nthrough a combination of temporal point processes with auto-regressive modeling\nenabling both transductive and inductive variants.

To answer these classification queries, some training\npoints are more relevant than others. We say a training point is relevant if\nits omission from the training set could induce the misclassification of some\nquery point in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. These relevant points are commonly known as\nborder points, as they define the boundaries of the Voronoi diagram of $P$ that\nseparate points of different classes. Being able to compute this set of points\nefficiently is crucial to reduce the size of the training set without affecting\nthe accuracy of the nearest-neighbor classifier.\nImproving over a decades-long result by Clarkson, in a recent paper by\nEppstein an output-sensitive algorithm was proposed to find the set of border\npoints of $P$ in $O( n^2 + nk^2 )$ time, where $k$ is the size of such set.

    "abstract": "Integrating different representations from complementary sensing modalities\nis crucial for robust scene interpretation in autonomous driving. While deep\nlearning architectures that fuse vision and range data for 2D object detection\nhave thrived in recent years, the corresponding modalities can degrade in\nadverse weather or lighting conditions, ultimately leading to a drop in\nperformance. Although domain adaptation methods attempt to bridge the domain\ngap between source and target domains, they do not readily extend to\nheterogeneous data distributions. In this work, we propose an unsupervised\ndomain adaptation framework, which adapts a 2D object detector for RGB and\nlidar sensors to one or more target domains featuring adverse weather\nconditions. Our proposed approach consists of three components. First, a data\naugmentation scheme that simulates weather distortions is devised to add domain\nconfusion and prevent overfitting on the source data. Second, to promote\ncross-domain foreground object alignment, we leverage the complementary\nfeatures of multiple modalities through a multi-scale entropy-weighted domain\ndiscriminator. Finally, we use carefully designed pretext tasks to learn a more\nrobust representation of the target domain data. Experiments performed on the\nDENSE dataset show that our method can substantially alleviate the domain gap\nunder the single-target domain adaptation (STDA) setting and the less explored\nyet more general multi-target domain adaptation (MTDA) setting.",

Due to the conditional\nindependence assumption, CTC-based models are always weaker than\nattention-based encoder-decoder models and require the assistance of external\nlanguage models (LMs). To solve this issue, we propose two knowledge\ntransferring methods that leverage pre-trained LMs, such as BERT and GPT2, to\nimprove CTC-based models. The first method is based on representation learning,\nin which the CTC-based models use the representation produced by BERT as an\nauxiliary learning target. The second method is based on joint classification\nlearning, which combines GPT2 for text modeling with a hybrid CTC/attention\narchitecture. Experiment on AISHELL-1 corpus yields a character error rate\n(CER) of 4.2% on the test set. When compared to the vanilla CTC-based models\nfine-tuned from the wav2vec2.0 models, our knowledge transferring method\nreduces CER by 16.1% relatively without external LMs.",

In this paper, we describe regularized empirical risk\nminimization algorithms that continually release models for a recent window of\ndata. One version of the algorithm uses the entire data history to improve the\nmodel for the recent window. The second version uses a sliding window of\nconstant size to improve the model, ensuring more relevant models in case of\nevolving data. The algorithms operate in the framework of stochastic gradient\ndescent. We prove that even with releasing a model at each time-step over an\ninfinite time horizon, the privacy cost of any data point is bounded by a\nconstant $\\epsilon$ differential privacy, and the accuracy of the output models\nare close to optimal. Experiments on MNIST and Arxiv publications data show\nresults consistent with the theory.",

    "abstract": "Learning to classify video data from classes not included in the training\ndata, i.e. video-based zero-shot learning, is challenging. We conjecture that\nthe natural alignment between the audio and visual modalities in video data\nprovides a rich training signal for learning discriminative multi-modal\nrepresentations. Focusing on the relatively underexplored task of audio-visual\nzero-shot learning, we propose to learn multi-modal representations from\naudio-visual data using cross-modal attention and exploit textual label\nembeddings for transferring knowledge from seen classes to unseen classes.\nTaking this one step further, in our generalised audio-visual zero-shot\nlearning setting, we include all the training classes in the test-time search\nspace which act as distractors and increase the difficulty while making the\nsetting more realistic. Due to the lack of a unified benchmark in this domain,\nwe introduce a (generalised) zero-shot learning benchmark on three audio-visual\ndatasets of varying sizes and difficulty, VGGSound, UCF, and ActivityNet,\nensuring that the unseen test classes do not appear in the dataset used for\nsupervised training of the backbone deep models. Comparing multiple relevant\nand recent methods, we demonstrate that our proposed AVCA model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on all three datasets.

    "abstract": "We consider so-called $N$-fold integer programs (IPs) of the form $\\max\\{c^T\nx : Ax = b, \\ell \\leq x \\leq u, x \\in \\mathbb Z^{nt}\\}, where $A \\in \\mathbb\nZ^{(r+sn)\\times nt} consists of $n$ arbitrary matrices $A^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb\nZ^{r\\times t}$ on a horizontal, and $n$ arbitrary matrices $B^{(j)} \\in \\mathbb\nZ^{s\\times t} on a diagonal line. Several recent works design fixed-parameter\nalgorithms for $N$-fold IPs by taking as parameters the numbers of rows and\ncolumns of the $A$- and $B$-matrices, together with the largest absolute value\n$\\Delta$ over their entries. These advances provide fast algorithms for several\nwell-studied combinatorial optimization problems on strings, on graphs, and in\nmachine scheduling. In this work, we extend this research by proposing\nalgorithms that additionally harness a partition structure of submatrices\n$A^{(i)}$ and $B^{(j)}$, where row indices of non-zero entries do not overlap\nbetween any two sets in the partition. Our main result is an algorithm for\nsolving any $N$-fold IP in time $nt\nlog(nt)L^2(S_A)^{O(r+s)}(p_Ap_B\\Delta)^{O(rp_Ap_B+sp_Ap_B)}$, where $p_A$ and\n$p_B$ are the size of the largest set in such a partition of $A^{(i)}$ and\n$B^{(j)}$, respectively, $S_A$ is the number of parts in the partition of $A =\n(A^{(1)},..., A^{(n)}), and $L = (log(||u - \\ell||_\\infty)\\cdot\n(log(max_{x:\\ell \\leq x \\leq u} |c^Tx|))$ is a measure of the input. We show\nthat these new structural parameters are naturally small in high-multiplicity\nscheduling problems, such as makespan minimization on related and unrelated\nmachines, with and without release times, the Santa Claus objective, and the\nweighted sum of completion times. In essence, we obtain algorithms that are\nexponentially faster than previous works by Knop et al. (ESA 2017) and\nEisenbrand et al./Kouteck{\\'y} et al.

    "abstract": "We consider real-time timely tracking of infection status (e.g., covid-19) of\nindividuals in a population. In this work, a health care provider wants to\ndetect infected people as well as people who have recovered from the disease as\nquickly as possible. In order to measure the timeliness of the tracking\nprocess, we use the long-term average difference between the actual infection\nstatus of the people and their real-time estimate by the health care provider\nbased on the most recent test results. We first find an analytical expression\nfor this average difference for given test rates, infection rates and recovery\nrates of people. Next, we propose an alternating minimization based algorithm\nto find the test rates that minimize the average difference. We observe that if\nthe total test rate is limited, instead of testing all members of the\npopulation equally, only a portion of the population may be tested in unequal\nrates calculated based on their infection and recovery rates. Next, we\ncharacterize the average difference when the test measurements are erroneous\n(i.e., noisy). Further, we consider the case where the infection status of\nindividuals may be dependent, which happens when an infected person spreads the\ndisease to another person if they are not detected and isolated by the health\ncare provider. Then, we consider an age of incorrect information based error\nmetric where the staleness metric increases linearly over time as long as the\nhealth care provider does not detect the changes in the infection status of the\npeople. In numerical results, we observe that an increased population size\nincreases diversity of people with different infection and recovery rates which\nmay be exploited to spend testing capacity more efficiently. Depending on the\nhealth care provider's preferences, test rate allocation can be adjusted to\ndetect either the infected people or the recovered people more quickly.",

    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have drawn tremendous attention in the\npast three years. Compared with other deep learning modalities,\nhigh-performance hardware acceleration of GCNs is as critical but even more\nchallenging. The hurdles arise from the poor data locality and redundant\ncomputation due to the large size, high sparsity, and irregular non-zero\ndistribution of real-world graphs.\nIn this paper we propose a novel hardware accelerator for GCN inference,\ncalled I-GCN, that significantly improves data locality and reduces unnecessary\ncomputation. The mechanism is a new online graph restructuring algorithm we\nrefer to as islandization. The proposed algorithm finds clusters of nodes with\nstrong internal but weak external connections. The islandization process yields\ntwo major benefits. First, by processing islands rather than individual nodes,\nthere is better on-chip data reuse and fewer off-chip memory accesses. Second,\nthere is less redundant computation as aggregation for common/shared neighbors\nin an island can be reused. The parallel search, identification, and leverage\nof graph islands are all handled purely in hardware at runtime working in an\nincremental pipeline. This is done without any preprocessing of the graph data\nor adjustment of the GCN model structure.\nExperimental results show that I-GCN can significantly reduce off-chip\naccesses and prune 38% of aggregation operations, leading to performance\nspeedups over CPUs, GPUs, the prior art GCN accelerators of 5549x, 403x, and\n5.7x on average, respectively.",

However, using\nstate-of-the-art methods to measure emotions and moral concerns in social media\nmessages posted in the early stage of the pandemic, we see a counter-intuitive\nrise in some positive affect. In addition, we measure changes in emotions and\nmoral concerns during notable events, such as the first US death and\nstate-ordered lockdowns, and find that negativity shows a short-term increase\nand then a counter-intuitive decrease after COVID-19 takes hold in the US. We\nhypothesize that the long-term increase of positivity, as well as amelioration\nof short-term negative reactions, are associated with hedonic adaptation,\nemotion regulation, and a decrease of uncertainty. Finally, we identify a\npartisan divide in affect that emerged after the first US death, which resulted\nin differences in moral and emotional reactions of liberals and conservatives\nand among US regions. Overall, these results show how collective emotional\nstates have changed since the pandemic began, and how social media can provide\na useful tool to understand, and even regulate, diverse patterns underlying\nhuman affect.",

    "abstract": "Humans are in constant contact with the world as they move through it and\ninteract with it. This contact is a vital source of information for\nunderstanding 3D humans, 3D scenes, and the interactions between them. In fact,\nwe demonstrate that these human-scene interactions (HSIs) can be leveraged to\nimprove the 3D reconstruction of a scene from a monocular RGB video. Our key\nidea is that, as a person moves through a scene and interacts with it, we\naccumulate HSIs across multiple input images, and optimize the 3D scene to\nreconstruct a consistent, physically plausible and functional 3D scene layout.\nOur optimization-based approach exploits three types of HSI constraints: (1)\nhumans that move in a scene are occluded or occlude objects, thus, defining the\ndepth ordering of the objects, (2) humans move through free space and do not\ninterpenetrate objects, (3) when humans and objects are in contact, the contact\nsurfaces occupy the same place in space. Using these constraints in an\noptimization formulation across all observations, we significantly improve the\n3D scene layout reconstruction. Furthermore, we show that our scene\nreconstruction can be used to refine the initial 3D human pose and shape (HPS)\nestimation. We evaluate the 3D scene layout reconstruction and HPS estimation\nqualitatively and quantitatively using the PROX and PiGraphs datasets.

    "abstract": "Decarbonization in the energy sector has been accompanied by an increased\npenetration of new renewable energy sources in electric power systems. Such\nsources differ from traditional productions in that, first, they induce larger,\nundispatchable fluctuations in power generation and second, they lack inertia.\nTherefore, substituting new renewables for traditional generation induces\nstronger and more frequent disturbances and modifies the way disturbances\npropagate across AC electric power grids. Recent measurements have indeed\nreported long, non-Gaussian tails in the distribution of local grid-frequency\ndata. Large frequency deviations may induce grid instabilities, leading in\nworst-case scenarios to cascading failures and large-scale blackouts. In this\nmanuscript, we investigate how correlated noise disturbances, characterized by\nthe cumulants of their distribution, propagate through meshed, high-voltage\npower grids. We show that for a single source of fluctuations,\nnon-Gaussianities in the form of finite skewness and positive kurtosis of the\nnoise distribution propagate over the entire network when the noise correlation\ntime is larger than the network's intrinsic time scales, but that they vanish\nover short distances if the noise fluctuates rapidly. We furthermore show that\na Berry-Esseen theorem leads to the vanishing of non-Gaussianities as the\nnumber of uncorrelated noise sources increases. Our results show that the\npersistence of non-Gaussian fluctuations of feed-in power have a global impact\non power-grid dynamics when they fluctuate over time scales larger than the\nintrinsic time scales of the system, which, we argue, is the relevant regime in\nreal power grids.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework\nnamed BoostMIS that combines adaptive pseudo labeling and informative active\nannotation to unleash the potential of medical image SSL models: (1) BoostMIS\ncan adaptively leverage the cluster assumption and consistency regularization\nof the unlabeled data according to the current learning status. This strategy\ncan adaptively generate one-hot ``hard'' labels converted from task model\npredictions for better task model training. (2) For the unselected unlabeled\nimages with low confidence, we introduce an Active learning (AL) algorithm to\nfind the informative samples as the annotation candidates by exploiting virtual\nadversarial perturbation and model's density-aware entropy. These informative\ncandidates are subsequently fed into the next training cycle for better SSL\nlabel propagation. Notably, the adaptive pseudo-labeling and informative active\nannotation form a learning closed-loop that are mutually collaborative to boost\nmedical image SSL. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we\ncollected a metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC) dataset that\naims to optimize MESCC diagnosis and classification for improved specialist\nreferral and treatment. We conducted an extensive experimental study of\nBoostMIS on MESCC and another public dataset COVIDx. The experimental results\nverify our framework's effectiveness and generalisability for different medical\nimage datasets with a significant improvement over various state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the merits of applying log-gradient input images to\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tinyML computer vision (CV). We show\nthat log gradients enable: (i) aggressive 1.5-bit quantization of first-layer\ninputs, (ii) potential CNN resource reductions, and (iii) inherent robustness\nto illumination changes (1.7% accuracy loss across 1/32...8 brightness\nvariation vs. up to 10% for JPEG). We establish these results using the PASCAL\nRAW image data set and through a combination of experiments using neural\narchitecture search and a fixed three-layer network. The latter reveal that\ntraining on log-gradient images leads to higher filter similarity, making the\nCNN more prunable. The combined benefits of aggressive first-layer\nquantization, CNN resource reductions, and operation without tight exposure\ncontrol and image signal processing (ISP) are helpful for pushing tinyML CV\ntoward its ultimate efficiency limits.",

However, the choice\nof the prior distribution that fix the dimensionality across all the data can\nrestrict the flexibility of this approach to learn robust representations. We\npresent a novel sparsity-inducing spike-slab prior that uses sparsity as a\nmechanism to provide flexibility that allows each data point to learn its own\ndimension distribution. In addition, it provides a mechanism to learn a joint\ndistribution of the latent variable and the sparsity. Thus, unlike other\napproaches, it can account for the full uncertainty in the latent space.\nThrough a series of experiments using in-distribution and out-of-distribution\nlearning scenarios on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST data we show that the\nproposed approach improves the accuracy and robustness compared with the\ntraditional fixed -imensional priors as well as other sparsity-induction\nmechanisms proposed in the literature.",

    "abstract": "As quotidian use of sophisticated cameras surges, people in modern society\nare more interested in capturing fine-quality images. However, the quality of\nthe images might be inferior to people's expectations due to the noise\ncontamination in the images. Thus, filtering out the noise while preserving\nvital image features is an essential requirement. Current existing denoising\nmethods have their own assumptions on the probability distribution in which the\ncontaminated noise is sampled for the method to attain its expected denoising\nperformance. In this paper, we utilize our recent Gramian-based filtering\nscheme to remove noise sampled from five prominent probability distributions\nfrom selected images. This method preserves image smoothness by adopting\npatches partitioned from the image, rather than pixels, and retains vital image\nfeatures by performing denoising on the manifold underlying the patch space\nrather than in the image domain. We validate its denoising performance, using\nthree benchmark computer vision test images applied to two state-of-the-art\ndenoising methods, namely BM3D and K-SVD.",

In\nthis work, we propose a Koopman operator based approach for time-dependent\nreliability analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. Since the Koopman\nrepresentations can transform any nonlinear dynamical system into a linear\ndynamical system, the time evolution of dynamical systems can be obtained by\nKoopman operators seamlessly regardless of the nonlinear or chaotic behavior.\nDespite the fact that the Koopman theory has been in vogue a long time back,\nidentifying intrinsic coordinates is a challenging task; to address this, we\npropose an end-to-end deep learning architecture that learns the Koopman\nobservables and then use it for time marching the dynamical response. Unlike\npurely data-driven approaches, the proposed approach is robust even in the\npresence of uncertainties; this renders the proposed approach suitable for\ntime-dependent reliability analysis. We propose two architectures; one suitable\nfor time-dependent reliability analysis when the system is subjected to random\ninitial condition and the other suitable when the underlying system have\nuncertainties in system parameters. The proposed approach is robust and\ngeneralizes to unseen environment (out-of-distribution prediction). Efficacy of\nthe proposed approached is illustrated using three numerical examples.

In this paper, we\nfocus on the sparse feature segmentation task and make a task-oriented network\ndesign, in which the target objects are sparsely distributed and the background\nis hard to be mathematically modeled. We start from an image decomposition\nmodel with sparsity regularization, and propose a deep unfolding network,\nnamely IDNet, based on an iterative solver, scaled alternating direction method\nof multipliers (scaled-ADMM). The IDNet splits raw inputs into double feature\nlayers. Then a new task-oriented segmentation network is constructed, dubbed as\nIDmUNet, based on the proposed IDNets and a mini-UNet. Because of the sparsity\nprior and deep unfolding method in the structure design, this IDmUNet combines\nthe advantages of mathematical modeling and data-driven approaches. Firstly,\nour approach has mathematical interpretability and can achieve favorable\nperformance with far fewer learnable parameters. Secondly, our IDmUNet is\nrobust in a simple end-to-end training with explainable behaviors. In the\nexperiments of retinal vessel segmentation (RVS), IDmUNet produces the\nstate-of-the-art results with only 0.07m parameters, whereas SA-UNet, one of\nthe latest variants of UNet, contains 0.54m and the original UNet 31.04m.\nMoreover, the training procedure of our network converges faster without\noverfitting phenomenon.

Finally, we show that, by selecting\nappropriately the parameters of the feedback laws, we can determine the\nphysical properties of the \"traffic fluid\", i.e. we get free hand to create an\nartificial fluid that approximates the emerging traffic flow.",

    "abstract": "River bathymetry is critical for many aspects of water resources management.\nWe propose and demonstrate a bathymetry inversion method using a\ndeep-learning-based surrogate for shallow water equations solvers. The\nsurrogate uses the convolutional autoencoder with a shared-encoder,\nseparate-decoder architecture. It encodes the input bathymetry and decodes to\nseparate outputs for flow-field variables. A gradient-based optimizer is used\nto perform bathymetry inversion with the trained surrogate. Two\nphysically-based constraints on both bed elevation value and slope have to be\nadded as inversion loss regularizations to obtain usable inversion results.\nUsing the \"L-curve\" criterion, a heuristic approach was proposed to determine\nthe regularization parameters. Both the surrogate model and the inversion\nalgorithm show good performance. We found the bathymetry inversion process has\ntwo distinctive stages, which resembles the sculptural process of initial\nbroad-brush calving and final detailing. The inversion loss due to flow\nprediction error reaches its minimum in the first stage and remains almost\nconstant afterward. The bed elevation value and slope regularizations play the\ndominant role in the second stage in selecting the most probable solution. We\nalso found the surrogate architecture (whether with both velocity and water\nsurface elevation or velocity only as outputs) does not show significant impact\non inversion result.",

Existing audio captioning systems are generally based on an\nencoder-decoder architecture, in which acoustic information is extracted by an\naudio encoder and then a language decoder is used to generate the captions.\nTraining an audio captioning system often encounters the problem of data\nscarcity. Transferring knowledge from pre-trained audio models such as\nPre-trained Audio Neural Networks (PANNs) have recently emerged as a useful\nmethod to mitigate this issue.

    "abstract": "Predicting molecular conformations from molecular graphs is a fundamental\nproblem in cheminformatics and drug discovery. Recently, significant progress\nhas been achieved with machine learning approaches, especially with deep\ngenerative models. Inspired by the diffusion process in classical\nnon-equilibrium thermodynamics where heated particles will diffuse from\noriginal states to a noise distribution, in this paper, we propose a novel\ngenerative model named GeoDiff for molecular conformation prediction. GeoDiff\ntreats each atom as a particle and learns to directly reverse the diffusion\nprocess (i.e., transforming from a noise distribution to stable conformations)\nas a Markov chain. Modeling such a generation process is however very\nchallenging as the likelihood of conformations should be roto-translational\ninvariant. We theoretically show that Markov chains evolving with equivariant\nMarkov kernels can induce an invariant distribution by design, and further\npropose building blocks for the Markov kernels to preserve the desirable\nequivariance property. The whole framework can be efficiently trained in an\nend-to-end fashion by optimizing a weighted variational lower bound to the\n(conditional) likelihood.

The VIT framework offered\ncontrol over imaging conditions, allowing us to show there was no change in\nperformance as CT exposure was changed from 28.5 to 57 mAs. The VIT framework\nalso provided voxel-level ground truth, revealing that performance of in-house\nmodel was much higher at AUC=0.87 for diffuse COVID-19 infection size >2.65%\nlung volume versus AUC=0.52 for focal disease with <2.65% volume.

The molecular\nconfigurations obtained from MD are represented by multiple features, such as\nthermodynamic properties, and are used as the ML input.

In this\nstudy, we present a simple supervised ML method to predict the transport\nproperties of materials. To simplify the model, an unsupervised ML method\nobtains an efficient representation of molecular movements.

    "abstract": "The item response theory obtains the estimates and their confidence intervals\nfor parameters of abilities of examinees and difficulties of problems by using\nthe observed item response matrix consisting of 0/1 value elements. Many papers\ndiscuss the performance of the estimates. However, this paper does not. Using\nthe maximum likelihood estimates, we can reconstruct the estimated item\nresponse matrix. Then we can assess the accuracy of this reconstructed matrix\nto the observed response matrix from the matrix decomposition perspective. That\nis, this paper focuses on the performance of the reconstructed response matrix.\nTo compare the performance of the item response theory with others, we provided\nthe two kinds of low rank response matrix by approximating the observed\nresponse matrix; one is the matrix via the singular value decomposition method\nwhen the response matrix is a complete matrix, and the other is the matrix via\nthe matrix decomposition method when the response matrix is an incomplete\nmatrix. We have, firstly, found that the performance of the singular value\ndecomposition method and the matrix decomposition method is almost the same\nwhen the response matrix is a complete matrix. Here, the performance is\nmeasured by the closeness between the two matrices using the root mean squared\nerrors and the accuracy. Secondary, we have seen that the closeness of the\nreconstructed matrix obtained from the item response theory to the observed\nmatrix is located between the two approximated low rank response matrices\nobtained from the matrix decomposition method of k= and k=2 to the observed\nmatrix, where k indicates the first k columns use in the decomposed matrices.",

Particularly, interpretability of the\ntreatment effects is preferable to many biomedical researchers. In this paper,\nwe first give a theoretical analysis and propose an upper bound for the bias of\naverage treatment effect estimation under the strong ignorability assumption.\nThe proposed upper bound consists of two parts: training error for factual\noutcomes, and the distance between treated and control distributions. We use\nthe Weighted Energy Distance (WED) to measure the distance between two\ndistributions. Motivated by the theoretical analysis, we implement this upper\nbound as an objective function being minimized by leveraging a novel additive\nneural network architecture, which combines the expressivity of deep neural\nnetwork, the interpretability of generalized additive model, the sufficiency of\nthe balancing score for estimation adjustment, and covariate balancing\nproperties of treated and control distributions, for estimating average\ntreatment effects from observational data. Furthermore, we impose a so-called\nweighted regularization procedure based on non-parametric theory, to obtain\nsome desirable asymptotic properties.

    "abstract": "Automated medical image segmentation is an essential task to aid/speed up\ndiagnosis and treatment procedures in clinical practices. Deep convolutional\nneural networks have exhibited promising performance in accurate and automatic\nseminal segmentation. For segmentation tasks, these methods normally rely on\nminimizing a cost/loss function that is designed to maximize the overlap\nbetween the estimated target and the ground-truth mask delineated by the\nexperts. A simple loss function based on the degrees of overlap (i.e., Dice\nmetric) would not take into account the underlying shape and morphology of the\ntarget subject, as well as its realistic/natural variations; therefore,\nsuboptimal segmentation results would be observed in the form of islands of\nvoxels, holes, and unrealistic shapes or deformations. In this light, many\nstudies have been conducted to refine/post-process the segmentation outcome and\nconsider an initial guess as prior knowledge to avoid outliers and/or\nunrealistic estimations. In this study, a novel shape-based cost function is\nproposed which encourages/constrains the network to learn/capture the\nunderlying shape features in order to generate a valid/realistic estimation of\nthe target structure. To this end, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was\nperformed on a vectorized training dataset to extract eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of the target subjects.

Models were trained and validated\nusing retrospective medical claims data and assessed using area under precision\nrecall and receiver operating characteristic curves (AUPRCs, AUROCs).\nResults The 6-month incidence of NASH in claims data was 1 per 1,437 at-risk\npatients and 1 per 2,127 non-NAFL at-risk patients. The model trained to detect\nNASH in all at-risk patients had an AUPRC of 0.0107 (95% CI 0.0104 - 0.011) and\nan AUROC of 0.84.

The model trained to detect NASH in non-NAFL patients had an\nAUPRC of 0.003 (95% CI 0.0029 - 0.0031) and an AUROC of 0.78. At 10% recall,\nmodel precision was 1%, which is 20x above NASH incidence.\nConclusion The low incidence of NASH in medical claims data corroborates the\npattern of NASH underdiagnosis in clinical practice.

In this regard, deep learning\nbased approaches have emerged as a useful tool for ASC problems. Conventional\napproaches to improving the classification accuracy include integrating\nauxiliary methods such as attention mechanism, pre-trained models and ensemble\nmultiple sub-networks. However, due to the complexity of audio clips captured\nfrom different environments, it is difficult to distinguish their categories\nwithout using any auxiliary methods for existing deep learning models using\nonly a single classifier.

The\ndecision forest consists of a fixed number of decision tree classifiers, which\nhave been shown to offer better classification performance than a single\nclassifier in some datasets. In particular, the decision forest differs\nsubstantially from traditional random forests as it is stochastic,\ndifferentiable, and capable of using the back-propagation to update and learn\nfeature representations in neural network.

Computing the information\ntransmission rate or the information encoded in the temporal characteristics of\nthese signals, requires the mutual information between the input and output\nsignals as a function of time, i.e. between the input and output trajectories.\nYet, this is notoriously difficult because of the high-dimensional nature of\nthe trajectory space, and all existing techniques require approximations. We\npresent an exact Monte Carlo technique called Path Weight Sampling (PWS) that,\nfor the first time, makes it possible to compute the mutual information between\ninput and output trajectories for any stochastic system that is described by a\nmaster equation. The principal idea is to use the master equation to evaluate\nthe exact conditional probability of an individual output trajectory for a\ngiven input trajectory, and average this via Monte Carlo sampling in trajectory\nspace to obtain the mutual information. We present three variants of PWS, which\nall generate the trajectories using the standard stochastic simulation\nalgorithm. While Direct PWS is a brute-force method, Rosenbluth-Rosenbluth PWS\nexploits the analogy between signal trajectory sampling and polymer sampling,\nand Thermodynamic Integration PWS is based on a reversible work calculation in\ntrajectory space. PWS also makes it possible to compute the mutual information\nbetween input and output trajectories for systems with hidden internal states\nas well as systems with feedback from output to input. Applying PWS to the\nbacterial chemotaxis system, consisting of 173 coupled chemical reactions,\ndemonstrates not only that the scheme is highly efficient, but also that the\nappropriate measure for quantifying information transmission via time-varying\nsignals is indeed the information transmission rate.",

To\novercome the curse of dimensionality of PF, the block PF (BPF) inserts a\nblocking step to partition the state space into several subspaces or blocks of\nsmaller dimension so that the correction and resampling steps can be performed\nindependently on each subspace. Using blocks of small size reduces the variance\nof the filtering distribution estimate, but in turn the correlation between\nblocks is broken and a bias is introduced.\nWhen the dependence relationships between state variables are unknown, it is\nnot obvious to decide how to split the state space into blocks and a\nsignificant error overhead may arise from a poor choice of partitioning. In\nthis paper, we formulate the partitioning problem in the BPF as a clustering\nproblem and we propose a state space partitioning method based on spectral\nclustering (SC). We design a generalized BPF algorithm that contains two new\nsteps: (i) estimation of the state vector correlation matrix from predicted\nparticles, (ii) SC using this estimate as the similarity matrix to determine an\nappropriate partition. In addition, a constraint is imposed on the maximal\ncluster size to prevent SC from providing too large blocks.

    "title": "Manoeuvre detection in Low Earth Orbit with Radar Data",
    "abstract": "This work outlines and assesses several methods for the detection of\nmanoeuvres in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) from surveillance radar data. To be able to\ndetect manoeuvres, the main starting assumption is that the object under\nanalysis has an orbit known with a sufficient degree of precision. Based on the\nprecise (a posteriori) orbit and radar data, several manoeuvre detection\nmethods are presented; one is based on unscented Kalman filtering, whereas two\nothers algorithms are based on reachability analysis of the state, which\ncorrelates its prediction set with the next track from the radar. The filtering\nalgorithm can be extended for several radar tracks, whereas the\nreachability-based methods are more precise in detecting manoeuvres. Then, to\ninherit the best properties of both classes of algorithms, a manoeuvre\ndetection filter that combines both concepts is finally presented. Manoeuvre\ndetection results are presented first for simulated scenarios -- for validation\nand calibration purposes -- and later for real data. Radar information comes\nfrom the Spanish Space Surveillance Radar (S3TSR), with real manoeuvre\ninformation and high-quality ephemerides. The results show promise, taking into\naccount that a single surveillance radar is the only source of data, obtaining\nmanoeuvre detection rates of more than 50% and false positive rates of less\nthan 10%.",

    "abstract": "Good generalization performance on high-dimensional data crucially hinges on\na simple structure of the ground truth and a corresponding strong inductive\nbias of the estimator. Even though this intuition is valid for regularized\nmodels, in this paper we caution against a strong inductive bias for\ninterpolation in the presence of noise: Our results suggest that, while a\nstronger inductive bias encourages a simpler structure that is more aligned\nwith the ground truth, it also increases the detrimental effect of noise.\nSpecifically, for both linear regression and classification with a sparse\nground truth, we prove that minimum $\\ell_p$-norm and maximum $\\ell_p$-margin\ninterpolators achieve fast polynomial rates up to order $1/n$ for $p > 1$\ncompared to a logarithmic rate for $p = 1$. Finally, we provide experimental\nevidence that this trade-off may also play a crucial role in understanding\nnon-linear interpolating models used in practice.",

    "abstract": "Differential privacy provides a theoretical framework for processing a\ndataset about $n$ users, in a way that the output reveals a minimal information\nabout any single user. Such notion of privacy is usually ensured by\nnoise-adding mechanisms and amplified by several processes, including\nsubsampling, shuffling, iteration, mixing and diffusion. In this work, we\nprovide privacy amplification bounds for quantum and quantum-inspired\nalgorithms. In particular, we show for the first time, that algorithms running\non quantum encoding of a classical dataset or the outcomes of quantum-inspired\nclassical sampling, amplify differential privacy. Moreover, we prove that a\nquantum version of differential privacy is amplified by the composition of\nquantum channels, provided that they satisfy some mixing conditions.",
