    "title": "SUPERNOVA: Automating Test Selection and Defect Prevention in AAA Video  Games Using Risk Based Testing and Machine Learning",
    "abstract": "Testing video games is an increasingly difficult task as traditional methods\nfail to scale with growing software systems. Manual testing is a very\nlabor-intensive process, and therefore quickly becomes cost prohibitive. Using\nscripts for automated testing is affordable, however scripts are ineffective in\nnon-deterministic environments, and knowing when to run each test is another\nproblem altogether. The modern game's complexity, scope, and player\nexpectations are rapidly increasing where quality control is a big portion of\nthe production cost and delivery risk. Reducing this risk and making production\nhappen is a big challenge for the industry currently. To keep production costs\nrealistic up-to and after release, we are focusing on preventive quality\nassurance tactics alongside testing and data analysis automation. We present\nSUPERNOVA (Selection of tests and Universal defect Prevention in External\nRepositories for Novel Objective Verification of software Anomalies), a system\nresponsible for test selection and defect prevention while also functioning as\nan automation hub. By integrating data analysis functionality with machine and\ndeep learning capability, SUPERNOVA assists quality assurance testers in\nfinding bugs and developers in reducing defects, which improves stability\nduring the production cycle and keeps testing costs under control. The direct\nimpact of this has been observed to be a reduction in 55% or more testing hours\nfor an undisclosed sports game title that has shipped, which was using these\ntest selection optimizations. Furthermore, using risk scores generated by a\nsemi-supervised machine learning model, we are able to detect with 71%\nprecision and 77% recall the probability of a change-list being bug inducing,\nand provide a detailed breakdown of this inference to developers. These efforts\nimprove workflow and reduce testing hours required on game titles in\ndevelopment.",

    "abstract": "The ability to grasp objects is an essential skill that enables many robotic\nmanipulation tasks. Recent works have studied point cloud-based methods for\nobject grasping by starting from simulated datasets and have shown promising\nperformance in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, many of them still strongly\nrely on ad-hoc geometric heuristics to generate grasp candidates, which fail to\ngeneralize to objects with significantly different shapes with respect to those\nobserved during training. Moreover, these methods are generally inefficient\nwith respect to the number of training samples and the time needed during\ndeployment. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end learning solution to\ngenerate 6-DOF parallel-jaw grasps starting from the partial view of the\nobject. Our Learning to Grasp (L2G) method takes as input object point clouds\nand is guided by a principled multi-task optimization objective that generates\na diverse set of grasps combining contact point sampling, grasp regression, and\ngrasp evaluation. With a thorough experimental analysis, we show the\neffectiveness of the proposed method as well as its robustness and\ngeneralization abilities.",

Experiments were performed with a pre-trained multilingual BERT as\nwell as with a pair of monolingual BERT models.

It\nwas demonstrated that such transformation helps to prevent mismatching issue\nand shown that this approach gives better results than using embeddings of the\nmultilingual model.

    "abstract": "Most of the current techniques for face recognition require the presence of a\nfull face of the person to be recognized, and this situation is difficult to\nachieve in practice, the required person may appear with a part of his face,\nwhich requires prediction of the part that did not appear. Most of the current\nforecasting processes are done by what is known as image interpolation, which\ndoes not give reliable results, especially if the missing part is large. In\nthis work, we adopted the process of stitching the face by completing the\nmissing part with the flipping of the part shown in the picture, depending on\nthe fact that the human face is characterized by symmetry in most cases. To\ncreate a complete model, two facial recognition methods were used to prove the\nefficiency of the algorithm. The selected face recognition algorithms that are\napplied here are Eigenfaces and geometrical methods. Image stitching is the\nprocess during which distinctive photographic images are combined to make a\ncomplete scene or a high-resolution image. Several images are integrated to\nform a wide-angle panoramic image. The quality of the image stitching is\ndetermined by calculating the similarity among the stitched image and original\nimages and by the presence of the seam lines through the stitched images. The\nEigenfaces approach utilizes PCA calculation to reduce the feature vector\ndimensions. It provides an effective approach for discovering the\nlower-dimensional space. In addition, to enable the proposed algorithm to\nrecognize the face, it also ensures a fast and effective way of classifying\nfaces. The phase of feature extraction is followed by the classifier phase.",

It is challenging to reliably match a ground image to\nthe correct satellite image since the images have significant viewpoint\ndifferences. Existing works have demonstrated localization in constrained\nscenarios over small areas but have not demonstrated wider-scale localization.\nOur approach, called Wide-Area Geolocalization (WAG), combines a neural network\nwith a particle filter to achieve global position estimates for agents moving\nin GPS-denied environments, scaling efficiently to city-scale regions. WAG\nintroduces a trinomial loss function for a Siamese network to robustly match\nnon-centered image pairs and thus enables the generation of a smaller satellite\nimage database by coarsely discretizing the search area. A modified particle\nfilter weighting scheme is also presented to improve localization accuracy and\nconvergence. Taken together, WAG's network training and particle filter\nweighting approach achieves city-scale position estimation accuracies on the\norder of 20 meters, a 98% reduction compared to a baseline training and\nweighting approach. Applied to a smaller-scale testing area, WAG reduces the\nfinal position estimation error by 64% compared to a state-of-the-art baseline\nfrom the literature.

    "abstract": "Constructing a diverse repertoire of manipulation skills in a scalable\nfashion remains an unsolved challenge in robotics. One way to address this\nchallenge is with unstructured human play, where humans operate freely in an\nenvironment to reach unspecified goals. Play is a simple and cheap method for\ncollecting diverse user demonstrations with broad state and goal coverage over\nan environment. Due to this diverse coverage, existing approaches for learning\nfrom play are more robust to online policy deviations from the offline data\ndistribution. However, these methods often struggle to learn under scene\nvariation and on challenging manipulation primitives, due in part to improperly\nassociating complex behaviors to the scene changes they induce. Our insight is\nthat an object-centric view of play data can help link human behaviors and the\nresulting changes in the environment, and thus improve multi-task policy\nlearning. In this work, we construct a latent space to model object affordances\n-- properties of an object that define its uses -- in the environment, and then\nlearn a policy to achieve the desired affordances. By modeling and predicting\nthe desired affordance across variable horizon tasks, our method, Predicting\nLatent Affordances Through Object-Centric Play (PLATO), outperforms existing\nmethods on complex manipulation tasks in both 2D and 3D object manipulation\nsimulation environments for diverse types of interactions.

    "abstract": "Tangle is a distributed ledger technology that stores data as a directed\nacyclic graph (DAG). Unlike blockchain, Tangle does not require dedicated\nminers for its operation. This makes Tangle suitable for Internet of Things\n(IoT) applications. To prevent congestion and spamming, distributed ledgers\nhave a built-in transaction rate control mechanism. This is typically achieved\nby increasing or decreasing the proof of work (PoW) difficulty level;\nunfortunately, this simplistic mechanism gives an unfair advantage to users\nwith high computational power. This paper proposes a principal-agent problem\n(PAP) framework from microeconomics to control the transaction rate in Tangle.\nWith users as the agents and the transaction rate controller as the principal,\nwe design a truth-telling mechanism to assign PoW difficulty levels to agents\nas a function of their computational power. The solution of the PAP is achieved\nby compensating a higher PoW difficulty level with a larger weight/reputation\nfor the transaction. The solution of PAP is obtained by solving a mixed-integer\noptimization problem. Moreover, we show that the decision variables have useful\nstructures: the optimal solution of the PAP increases with the computational\npower of the agents. We also show that the optimal PoW increases with the\nnumber of agents. The structural result reduces the search space of the\nmixed-integer program and enables efficient computation of the optimal\nmechanism. Finally, via numerical examples, we illustrate the transaction rate\ncontrol mechanism and study its impact on the dynamics of Tangle.",

In this paper, we tackle this problem by\nattempting to select a balanced labeled dataset for SSL that would result in an\nunbiased model. Unfortunately, acquiring a balanced labeled dataset from a\nclass imbalanced distribution in one shot is challenging. We propose BASIL\n(Balanced Active Semi-supervIsed Learning), a novel algorithm that optimizes\nthe submodular mutual information (SMI) functions in a per-class fashion to\ngradually select a balanced dataset in an active learning loop. Importantly,\nour technique can be efficiently used to improve the performance of any SSL\nmethod. Our experiments on Path-MNIST and Organ-MNIST medical datasets for a\nwide array of SSL methods show the effectiveness of Basil. Furthermore, we\nobserve that Basil outperforms the state-of-the-art diversity and uncertainty\nbased active learning methods since the SMI functions select a more balanced\ndataset.",

However, LiDAR's diverging point pattern with increasing distance\nresults in a non-uniform sampled point cloud ill-suited to discretized\nvolumetric feature extraction. Current methods either rely on voxelized point\nclouds or use inefficient farthest point sampling to mitigate detrimental\neffects caused by density variation but largely ignore point density as a\nfeature and its predictable relationship with distance from the LiDAR sensor.\nOur proposed solution, Point Density-Aware Voxel network (PDV), is an\nend-to-end two stage LiDAR 3D object detection architecture that is designed to\naccount for these point density variations. PDV efficiently localizes voxel\nfeatures from the 3D sparse convolution backbone through voxel point centroids.\nThe spatially localized voxel features are then aggregated through a\ndensity-aware RoI grid pooling module using kernel density estimation (KDE) and\nself-attention with point density positional encoding. Finally, we exploit\nLiDAR's point density to distance relationship to refine our final bounding box\nconfidences.

A prominent way\nto utilize the unlabeled data is by consistency training which commonly uses a\nteacher-student network, where a teacher guides a student segmentation. The\npredictions of unlabeled data are not reliable, therefore, uncertainty-aware\nmethods have been proposed to gradually learn from meaningful and reliable\npredictions. Uncertainty estimation, however, relies on multiple inferences\nfrom model predictions that need to be computed for each training step, which\nis computationally expensive. This work proposes a novel method to estimate the\npixel-level uncertainty by leveraging the labeling representation of\nsegmentation masks. On the one hand, a labeling representation is learnt to\nrepresent the available segmentation masks. The learnt labeling representation\nis used to map the prediction of the segmentation into a set of plausible\nmasks. Such a reconstructed segmentation mask aids in estimating the\npixel-level uncertainty guiding the segmentation network. The proposed method\nestimates the uncertainty with a single inference from the labeling\nrepresentation, thereby reducing the total computation. We evaluate our method\non the 3D segmentation of left atrium in MRI, and we show that our uncertainty\nestimates from our labeling representation improve the segmentation accuracy\nover state-of-the-art methods.",

To\nmitigate that laborious task, automatic tools have been developed where the\nmajority of solutions are supervised techniques.

    "abstract": "Novel Internet-of-Things (IoT) access technologies are emerging as part of\nthe next generation cellular networks. These technologies are specifically\noriented towards energy-limited IoT devices that are scattered far away from\ntheir serving base station. One of the key methods of achieving deep coverage\nis via repeated transmissions of data. However, repetition leads to higher\nenergy consumption and reduces the device battery-lifetime. Thus, a trade-off\nbetween coverage and energy consumption exists and requires careful\ninvestigation. This paper evaluates the effects of transmission repetition on\nenhancing the probability of coverage and the cost of the incurred energy.\nUsing an empirical repetition profile based on traffic load and device distance\nfrom the base station, we derive the coverage probability and energy profile\nmodels for IoT links that utilize two different diversity combining techniques.\nIn particular, we focus on two common diversity combining that are; (i)\nSelection Combining (SC), and (ii) Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC). We utilize\ntools from stochastic geometry to formulate an analytic framework that compares\nthese two combining methods. This framework can aid network designers in\njointly maximizing the network coverage while minimizing the energy expenditure\nof devices.",

    "abstract": "Through Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), a global coverage connecting areas\nwith minimal or no terrestrial services is envisaged using satellite and\nair-borne platforms. However, one of the challenges to delivering NTN\ncommunications is the increased levels of path-loss, relative to typical\nterrestrial scenarios, due to the vast communication distance towards satellite\nplatforms. Typically, cellular IoT technologies adopt frame repetitions where\nmany redundant data transmissions are included to enhance its success rate.\nThis can be also extended to satellite links to counter the effect of long\ndistance communications on the link budget. In this paper, we put forth an\nanalytic framework that captures the repetition behavior based on the\nprobability of line-of-sight (LoS), as it heavily influences the propagation\nconditions. We analyze the coverage performance in terms of the frame success\nrate, which allows us to tune the repetitions behavior to suit a given\nsatellite admittance region. Furthermore, we obtain an optimal global average\nsuccess rate by considering the availability of satellites.

    "abstract": "Continual learning, also known as lifelong learning, is an emerging research\ntopic that has been attracting increasing interest in the field of machine\nlearning. With human activity recognition (HAR) playing a key role in enabling\nnumerous real-world applications, an essential step towards the long-term\ndeployment of such recognition systems is to extend the activity model to\ndynamically adapt to changes in people's everyday behavior. Current research in\ncontinual learning applied to HAR domain is still under-explored with\nresearchers exploring existing methods developed for computer vision in HAR.\nMoreover, analysis has so far focused on task-incremental or class-incremental\nlearning paradigms where task boundaries are known. This impedes the\napplicability of such methods for real-world systems since data is presented in\na randomly streaming fashion. To push this field forward, we build on recent\nadvances in the area of continual machine learning and design a lifelong\nadaptive learning framework using Prototypical Networks, LAPNet-HAR, that\nprocesses sensor-based data streams in a task-free data-incremental fashion and\nmitigates catastrophic forgetting using experience replay and continual\nprototype adaptation. Online learning is further facilitated using contrastive\nloss to enforce inter-class separation. LAPNet-HAR is evaluated on 5 publicly\navailable activity datasets in terms of the framework's ability to acquire new\ninformation while preserving previous knowledge. Our extensive empirical\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of LAPNet-HAR in task-free continual\nlearning and uncover useful insights for future challenges.",

    "abstract": "LiDAR-based localization and mapping is one of the core components in many\nmodern robotic systems due to the direct integration of range and geometry,\nallowing for precise motion estimation and generation of high quality maps in\nreal-time. Yet, as a consequence of insufficient environmental constraints\npresent in the scene, this dependence on geometry can result in localization\nfailure, happening in self-symmetric surroundings such as tunnels. This work\naddresses precisely this issue by proposing a neural network-based estimation\napproach for detecting (non-)localizability during robot operation. Special\nattention is given to the localizability of scan-to-scan registration, as it is\na crucial component in many LiDAR odometry estimation pipelines. In contrast to\nprevious, mostly traditional detection approaches, the proposed method enables\nearly detection of failure by estimating the localizability on raw sensor\nmeasurements without evaluating the underlying registration optimization.\nMoreover, previous approaches remain limited in their ability to generalize\nacross environments and sensor types, as heuristic-tuning of degeneracy\ndetection thresholds is required. The proposed approach avoids this problem by\nlearning from a corpus of different environments, allowing the network to\nfunction over various scenarios. Furthermore, the network is trained\nexclusively on simulated data, avoiding arduous data collection in challenging\nand degenerate, often hard-to-access, environments. The presented method is\ntested during field experiments conducted across challenging environments and\non two different sensor types without any modifications.

    "abstract": "The training phases of Deep neural network~(DNN) consumes enormous processing\ntime and energy. Compression techniques utilizing the sparsity of DNNs can\neffectively accelerate the inference phase of DNNs. However, it is hardly used\nin the training phase because the training phase involves dense\nmatrix-multiplication using General-Purpose Computation on Graphics Processors\n(GPGPU), which endorse the regular and structural data layout. In this paper,\nwe first propose the Approximate Random Dropout that replaces the conventional\nrandom dropout of neurons and synapses with a regular and online generated\nrow-based or tile-based dropout patterns to eliminate the unnecessary\ncomputation and data access for the multilayer perceptron~(MLP) and long\nshort-term memory~(LSTM).

Objective: The goal of this study was to develop and\nanalyze novel biomarkers that can help predict the development and progression\nof DAT. Methods: We used feature selection and ensemble learning classifier to\ndevelop an image/genotype-based DAT score that represents a subject's\nlikelihood of developing DAT in the future. Three feature types were used: MRI\nonly, genetic only, and combined multimodal data. We used a novel data\nstratification method to better represent different stages of DAT. Using a\npre-defined 0.5 threshold on DAT scores, we predicted whether or not a subject\nwould develop DAT in the future. Results: Our results on Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database showed that dementia scores using\ngenetic data could better predict future DAT progression for currently normal\ncontrol subjects (Accuracy=0.857) compared to MRI (Accuracy=0.143), while MRI\ncan better characterize subjects with stable mild cognitive impairment\n(Accuracy=0.614) compared to genetics (Accuracy=0.356). Combining MRI and\ngenetic data showed improved classification performance in the remaining\nstratified groups. Conclusion: MRI and genetic data can contribute to DAT\nprediction in different ways. MRI data reflects anatomical changes in the\nbrain, while genetic data can detect the risk of DAT progression prior to the\nsymptomatic onset.

Many recent\napproaches have also extended U-Net with more complex building blocks, which\ntypically increase the number of network parameters considerably. Such\ncomplexity makes the inference stage highly inefficient for clinical\napplications. Towards an effective yet economic segmentation network design, in\nthis work, we propose backward skip connections that bring decoded features\nback to the encoder. Our design can be jointly adopted with forward skip\nconnections in any encoder-decoder architecture forming a recurrence structure\nwithout introducing extra parameters. With the backward skip connections, we\npropose a U-Net based network family, namely Bi-directional O-shape networks,\nwhich set new benchmarks on multiple public medical imaging segmentation\ndatasets. On the other hand, with the most plain architecture (BiO-Net),\nnetwork computations inevitably increase along with the pre-set recurrence\ntime. We have thus studied the deficiency bottleneck of such recurrent design\nand propose a novel two-phase Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm,\nnamely BiX-NAS, to search for the best multi-scale bi-directional skip\nconnections. The ineffective skip connections are then discarded to reduce\ncomputational costs and speed up network inference. The finally searched\nBiX-Net yields the least network complexity and outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art counterparts by large margins.

However,\nstate-of-the-art optimization-based monocular VO methods suffer from the scale\ninconsistency problem for long-term predictions. Deep learning has recently\nbeen introduced to address this issue by leveraging stereo sequences or\nground-truth motions in the training dataset. However, it comes at an\nadditional cost for data collection, and such training data may not be\navailable in all datasets. In this work, we propose VRVO, a novel framework for\nretrieving the absolute scale from virtual data that can be easily obtained\nfrom modern simulation environments, whereas in the real domain no stereo or\nground-truth data are required in either the training or inference phases.\nSpecifically, we first train a scale-aware disparity network using both\nmonocular real images and stereo virtual data. The virtual-to-real domain gap\nis bridged by using an adversarial training strategy to map images from both\ndomains into a shared feature space. The resulting scale-consistent disparities\nare then integrated with a direct VO system by constructing a virtual stereo\nobjective that ensures the scale consistency over long trajectories.\nAdditionally, to address the suboptimality issue caused by the separate\noptimization backend and the learning process, we further propose a mutual\nreinforcement pipeline that allows bidirectional information flow between\nlearning and optimization, which boosts the robustness and accuracy of each\nother.

    "abstract": "Partial scan is a common approach for accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(MRI) data acquisition. However, it is challenging to accurately reconstruct\nimages from partial scan data (i.e., incomplete k-space matrices). Most\nstate-of-the-art reconstruction methods apply U-Net (a classical\nencoder-decoder form of convolutional neural network) or cascaded U-Nets in\nimage domain and/or k-space domain. These methods have great advantages over\ntraditional methods where deep learning is not involved in. Nevertheless, these\nmethods have following problems: (1) Directly applying U-Net in k-space domain\nis not optimal for extracting features in k-space domain; (2) Classical\nimage-domain oriented U-Net is heavy-weight and hence is inefficient to be\ncascaded many times for yielding good reconstruction accuracy; (3) Classical\nimage-domain oriented U-Net does not fully make use information of encoder\nnetwork for extracting features in decoder network; and (4) Existing methods\nare ineffective in simultaneously extracting and fusing features in image\ndomain and its dual k-space domain. To tackle these problems, we propose in\nthis paper (1) an image-domain encoder-decoder sub-network called V-Net which\nis more light-weight for cascading and effective in fully utilizing features in\nthe encoder for decoding, (2) a k-space domain sub-network called K-Net which\nis more suitable for extracting hierarchical features in k-space domain, and\n(3) a dual-domain reconstruction network where V-Nets and K-Nets are parallelly\nand effectively combined and cascaded. The effectiveness of KV-Net is\ndemonstrated on the challenging fastMRI dataset where large-scale raw k-space\ntraining data are available and ground truth of test data is not released.",

    "abstract": "In virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environments, the remote display\nprotocol has a big responsibility to transmit video data from a data\ncenter-hosted desktop to the endpoint. The protocol must ensure a high level of\nclient perceived end-to-end quality of service (QoS) under heavy work load\nconditions. Each remote display protocol works differently depending on the\nnetwork and which applications are being delivered. In healthcare applications,\ndoctors and nurses can use mobile devices directly to monitor patients.\nMoreover, the ability to implement tasks requiring high consumption of CPU and\nother resources is applicable to a variety of applications including research\nand cloud gaming. Such computer games and complex processes will run on\npowerful cloud servers and the screen contents will be transmitted to the\nclient. TO enable such applications, remote display technology requires further\nenhancements to meet more stringent requirements on bandwidth and QoS, an to\nallow realtime operation. In this paper, we present an architecture including\nflexible QoS control to improve the user quality of experience (QoE). The QoS\ncontrol is developed based on linear regression modeling using historical\nnetwork data. Additionally, the architecture includes a novel compression\nalgorithm of 2D images, designed to guarantee the best image quality and to\nreduce video delay; this algorithm is based on k-means clustering and can\nsatisfy the requirements of realtime onboard processing.

    "abstract": "Despite plenty of efforts focusing on improving the domain adaptation ability\n(DA) under unsupervised or few-shot semi-supervised settings, recently the\nsolution of active learning started to attract more attention due to its\nsuitability in transferring model in a more practical way with limited\nannotation resource on target data. Nevertheless, most active learning methods\nare not inherently designed to handle domain gap between data distribution, on\nthe other hand, some active domain adaptation methods (ADA) usually requires\ncomplicated query functions, which is vulnerable to overfitting. In this work,\nwe propose a concise but effective ADA method called\nSelect-by-Distinctive-Margin (SDM), which consists of a maximum margin loss and\na margin sampling algorithm for data selection. We provide theoretical analysis\nto show that SDM works like a Support Vector Machine, storing hard examples\naround decision boundaries and exploiting them to find informative and\ntransferable data. In addition, we propose two variants of our method, one is\ndesigned to adaptively adjust the gradient from margin loss, the other boosts\nthe selectivity of margin sampling by taking the gradient direction into\naccount. We benchmark SDM with standard active learning setting, demonstrating\nour algorithm achieves competitive results with good data scalability.

    "abstract": "Recently, post-training quantization (PTQ) has driven much attention to\nproduce efficient neural networks without long-time retraining. Despite its low\ncost, current PTQ works tend to fail under the extremely low-bit setting. In\nthis study, we pioneeringly confirm that properly incorporating activation\nquantization into the PTQ reconstruction benefits the final accuracy. To deeply\nunderstand the inherent reason, a theoretical framework is established,\nindicating that the flatness of the optimized low-bit model on calibration and\ntest data is crucial. Based on the conclusion, a simple yet effective approach\ndubbed as QDROP is proposed, which randomly drops the quantization of\nactivations during PTQ. Extensive experiments on various tasks including\ncomputer vision (image classification, object detection) and natural language\nprocessing (text classification and question answering) prove its superiority.\nWith QDROP, the limit of PTQ is pushed to the 2-bit activation for the first\ntime and the accuracy boost can be up to 51.49%. Without bells and whistles,\nQDROP establishes a new state of the art for PTQ.

    "abstract": "Entity alignment (EA) merges knowledge graphs (KGs) by identifying the\nequivalent entities in different graphs, which can effectively enrich knowledge\nrepresentations of KGs. However, in practice, different KGs often include\ndangling entities whose counterparts cannot be found in the other graph, which\nlimits the performance of EA methods. To improve EA with dangling entities, we\npropose an unsupervised method called Semi-constraint Optimal Transport for\nEntity Alignment in Dangling cases (SoTead). Our main idea is to model the\nentity alignment between two KGs as an optimal transport problem from one KG's\nentities to the others. First, we set pseudo entity pairs between KGs based on\npretrained word embeddings. Then, we conduct contrastive metric learning to\nobtain the transport cost between each entity pair. Finally, we introduce a\nvirtual entity for each KG to \"align\" the dangling entities from the other KGs,\nwhich relaxes the optimization constraints and leads to a semi-constraint\noptimal transport. In the experimental part, we first show the superiority of\nSoTead on a commonly-used entity alignment dataset. Besides, to analyze the\nability for dangling entity detection with other baselines, we construct a\nmedical cross-lingual knowledge graph dataset, MedED, where our SoTead also\nreaches state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Long scan time in phase encoding for forming complete K-space\nmatrices is a critical drawback of MRI, making patients uncomfortable and\nwasting important time for diagnosing emergent diseases. This paper aims to\nreducing the scan time by actively and sequentially selecting partial phases in\na short time so that a slice can be accurately reconstructed from the resultant\nslice-specific incomplete K-space matrix. Methods: A transformer based deep\nreinforcement learning framework is proposed for actively determining a\nsequence of partial phases according to reconstruction-quality based Q-value (a\nfunction of reward), where the reward is the improvement degree of\nreconstructed image quality. The Q-value is efficiently predicted from binary\nphase-indicator vectors, incomplete K-space matrices and their corresponding\nundersampled images with a light-weight transformer so that the sequential\ninformation of phases and global relationship in images can be used. The\ninverse Fourier transform is employed for efficiently computing the\nundersampled images and hence gaining the rewards of selecting phases. Results:\nExperimental results on the fastMRI dataset with original K-space data\naccessible demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy superiorities of proposed\nmethod. Compared with the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning based method\nproposed by Pineda et al., the proposed method is roughly 150 times faster and\nachieves significant improvement in reconstruction accuracy. Conclusions: We\nhave proposed a light-weight transformer based deep reinforcement learning\nframework for generating high-quality slice-specific trajectory consisting of a\nsmall number of phases. The proposed method, called TITLE (Transformer Involved\nTrajectory LEarning), has remarkable superiority in phase-encode selection\nefficiency and image reconstruction accuracy.",

Federated learning enables privacy-preserving\ndecentralized training which has several properties beneficial for camera-based\nsensing. We develop the first mobile federated learning camera-based sensing\nsystem and show that it can perform competitively with traditional\nstate-of-the-art supervised approaches.

The\nVCG redistribution mechanisms are efficient (the agents who value the resources\nthe most will be allocated), strategy-proof (the agents have no incentives to\nlie about their valuations), and weakly budget-balanced (no deficits).\nWe focus on the VCG redistribution mechanisms for the classic public project\nproblem, where a group of agents needs to decide whether or not to build a\nnon-excludable public project. We design mechanisms via neural networks with\ntwo welfare-maximizing objectives: optimal in the worst case and optimal in\nexpectation. Previous studies showed two worst-case optimal mechanisms for 3\nagents, but worst-case optimal mechanisms have not been identified for more\nthan 3 agents. For maximizing expected welfare, there are no existing results.\nWe use neural networks to design VCG redistribution mechanisms. Neural\nnetworks have been used to design the redistribution mechanisms for multi-unit\nauctions with unit demand. We show that for the public project problem, the\npreviously proposed neural networks, which led to optimal/near-optimal\nmechanisms for multi-unit auctions with unit demand, perform abysmally for the\npublic project problem.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose and analyze a new stochastic homogenization method\nfor diffusion equations with random and fast oscillatory coefficients. In the\nproposed method, the homogenized solutions are sought through a two-stage\nprocedure. In the first stage, the original oscillatory diffusion equation is\napproximated, for each fixed random sample w, by a spatially homogenized\ndiffusion equation with piecewise constant coefficients, resulting a random\ndiffusion equation. In the second stage, the resulted random diffusion equation\nis approximated and computed by using an efficient multi-modes Monte Carlo\nmethod which only requires to solve a diffusion equation with a constant\ndiffusion coefficient and a random right-hand side. The main advantage of the\nproposed method is that it separates the computational difficulty caused by the\nspatial fast oscillation of the solution and that caused by the randomness of\nthe solution, so they can be overcome separately using different strategies.\nThe convergence of the solution of the spatially homogenized equation (from the\nfirst stage) to the solution of the original random diffusion equation is\nestablished and the optimal rate of convergence is also obtained for the\nproposed multi-modes Monte Carlo method. Numerical experiments on some\nbenchmark test problems for random composite materials are also presented to\ngauge the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed two-stage stochastic\nhomogenization method.",

In the realm of financial decision making, a particularly\nsuccessful approach is the prize-linked savings account: individuals are\nincentivized to make deposits by tying deposits to a periodic lottery that\nawards bonuses to the savers. Although these lotteries have been very effective\nin motivating savers across the globe, they are a one-size-fits-all solution.\nWe investigate whether customized bonuses can be more effective. We formalize a\ndelayed-gratification task as a Markov decision problem and characterize\nindividuals as rational agents subject to temporal discounting, a cost\nassociated with effort, and fluctuations in willpower. Our theory is able to\nexplain key behavioral findings in intertemporal choice. We created an online\ndelayed-gratification game in which the player scores points by selecting a\nqueue to wait in and then performing a series of actions to advance to the\nfront.

    "abstract": "Co-salient object detection, with the target of detecting co-existed salient\nobjects among a group of images, is gaining popularity. Recent works use the\nattention mechanism or extra information to aggregate common co-salient\nfeatures, leading to incomplete even incorrect responses for target objects. In\nthis paper, we aim to mine comprehensive co-salient features with democracy and\nreduce background interference without introducing any extra information. To\nachieve this, we design a democratic prototype generation module to generate\ndemocratic response maps, covering sufficient co-salient regions and thereby\ninvolving more shared attributes of co-salient objects. Then a comprehensive\nprototype based on the response maps can be generated as a guide for final\nprediction. To suppress the noisy background information in the prototype, we\npropose a self-contrastive learning module, where both positive and negative\npairs are formed without relying on additional classification information.\nBesides, we also design a democratic feature enhancement module to further\nstrengthen the co-salient features by readjusting attention values. Extensive\nexperiments show that our model obtains better performance than previous\nstate-of-the-art methods, especially on challenging real-world cases (e.g., for\nCoCA, we obtain a gain of 2.0% for MAE, 5.4% for maximum F-measure, 2.3% for\nmaximum E-measure, and 3.7% for S-measure) under the same settings.

We evaluate state-of-the-art simulators applied to both Bitcoin\nand Ethereum and find that they suffer from low performance and scalability\nwhich are significant limitations. To build a more general and faster\nblockchain simulator, we extend an existing blockchain simulator, i.e.\nBlockSim. We add a network module integrated with a network topology generation\nalgorithm and a block propagation algorithm to generate a realistic blockchain\nnetwork and simulate the block propagation efficiently. We design a binary\ntransaction pool structure and migrate BlockSim from Python to C++ so that\nbitwise operations can be used to accelerate the simulation and reduce memory\nusage. Moreover, we modularize the simulator based on five primary blockchain\nprocesses. Significant blockchain elements including consensus protocols (PoW\nand PoS), information propagation algorithms (Gossip) and finalization rules\n(Longest rule and GHOST rule) are implemented in individual modules and can be\ncombined flexibly to simulate different types of blockchains. Experiments\ndemonstrate that the new simulator reduces the simulation time by an order of\nmagnitude and improves scalability, enabling us to simulate more than ten\nthousand nodes, roughly the size of the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.

Due to the advantage that appropriate function\napproximators can help mitigate the sample complexity burden in modern\nreinforcement learning problems, existing endeavors usually enforce powerful\nfunction representation models (e.g. neural networks) to learn the optimal\npolicies. However, a precise understanding of the statistical limits with\nfunction representations, remains elusive, even when such a representation is\nlinear.\nTowards this goal, we study the statistical limits of offline reinforcement\nlearning with linear model representations. To derive the tight offline\nlearning bound, we design the variance-aware pessimistic value iteration\n(VAPVI), which adopts the conditional variance information of the value\nfunction for time-inhomogeneous episodic linear Markov decision processes\n(MDPs). VAPVI leverages estimated variances of the value functions to reweight\nthe Bellman residuals in the least-square pessimistic value iteration and\nprovides improved offline learning bounds over the best-known existing results\n(whereas the Bellman residuals are equally weighted by design). More\nimportantly, our learning bounds are expressed in terms of system quantities,\nwhich provide natural instance-dependent characterizations that previous\nresults are short of.

It allows to lower the complexity of the network by\nintroducing sparsity in the weights. Because taking advantage of sparse\nmatrices is still challenging, pruning is often performed in a structured way,\ni.e. removing entire convolution filters in the case of ConvNets, according to\na chosen pruning criteria. Common pruning criteria, such as l1-norm or\nmovement, usually do not consider the individual utility of filters, which may\nlead to: (1) the removal of filters exhibiting rare, thus important and\ndiscriminative behaviour, and (2) the retaining of filters with redundant\ninformation.

Unfortunately, in this work, we show that learning invariant features\nunder this circumstance is fundamentally impossible without further inductive\nbiases or additional information. Then, we propose a framework to jointly learn\nenvironment partition and invariant representation, assisted by additional\nauxiliary information. We derive sufficient and necessary conditions for our\nframework to provably identify invariant features under a fairly general\nsetting. Experimental results on both synthetic and real world datasets\nvalidate our analysis and demonstrate an improved performance of the proposed\nframework over existing methods. Finally, our results also raise the need of\nmaking the role of inductive biases more explicit in future works, when\nconsidering learning invariant models without environment partition.",

    "abstract": "The open intent detection problem is presented in this paper, which aims to\nidentify known intents and detect open intent in natural language\nunderstanding. Current methods have two core challenges. On the one hand, the\nexisting methods have limitations in learning robust representations to detect\nthe open intent without any prior knowledge. On the other hand, there lacks an\neffective approach to learning the specific and compact decision boundary to\ndistinguish the known intents and the open intent. This paper introduces an\noriginal pipeline framework, DA-ADB, to address these issues, which\nsuccessively learns discriminative intent features with distance-aware strategy\nand appropriate decision boundaries adaptive to the feature space for open\nintent detection. The proposed method first leverages distance information to\nenhance the distinguishing capability of the intent representations. Then, it\nobtains discriminative decision boundaries adaptive to the known intent feature\nspace by balancing both the empirical and open space risks. Extensive\nexperiments show the effectiveness of distance-aware and boundary learning\nstrategies. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves\nsubstantial improvements on three benchmark intent datasets. It also yields\nrobust performance with different proportions of labeled data and known\ncategories.",

However,\nalgorithmic news curation has been hypothesized to create filter bubbles and to\nintensify users' selective exposure, potentially increasing their vulnerability\nto polarized opinions and fake news. In this paper, we show how information on\nnews items' stance and sentiment can be utilized to analyze and quantify the\nextent to which recommender systems suffer from biases. To that end, we have\nannotated a German news corpus on the topic of migration using stance detection\nand sentiment analysis. In an experimental evaluation with four different\nrecommender systems, our results show a slight tendency of all four models for\nrecommending articles with negative sentiments and stances against the topic of\nrefugees and migration. Moreover, we observed a positive correlation between\nthe sentiment and stance bias of the text-based recommenders and the\npreexisting user bias, which indicates that these systems amplify users'\nopinions and decrease the diversity of recommended news.

This solution manifold\ncannot be approximated properly by linear subspaces. To this end, nonlinear\napproaches for model order reduction of hyperbolic conservation laws are\nrequired. We propose a new method for nonlinear model order reduction that is\nespecially well-suited for hyperbolic equations with discontinuous solutions.\nThe approach is based on a space-time discretization and employs diffeomorphic\ntransformations of the underlying space-time domain to align the\ndiscontinuities. To derive a reduced model for the diffeomorphisms, the Lie\ngroup structure of the diffeomorphism group is used to associate\ndiffeomorphisms with corresponding velocity fields via the exponential map.

This involves information\nabout what types of objects are present, where they are, what their spatial\nextend is, and how they can be reached, i.e., information about free space is\nalso crucial. Semantic maps are a powerful instrument providing such\ninformation.

In this paper, we incorporate semantic information into efficient\noccupancy normal distribution transform (NDT) maps to enable real-time semantic\nmapping on mobile robots.

The proposed semantic NDT maps\ncan represent semantics to the same level of detail, while mapping is 2.7 to\n17.5 times faster.

Numerical results show\nthat the proposed DL approach achieves a 52% lower prediction error than the\ntraditional approach based on the Kalman filter (KF) in mean absolute errors.\nTo quantify impact of channel aging and prediction on precoding performance, we\nalso evaluate the performance degradation due to outdated and predicted channel\nstate information (CSI) compared to perfect CSI. Our simulations show that the\nproposed DL approach can reduce the performance loss due to channel aging by\n71% through adapting precoding vector to changes in radio channel while the\ntraditional KF approach only shows a 27% reduction.",

    "abstract": "The first two tasks of the CLEF 2019 ProtestNews events focused on\ndistinguishing between protest and non-protest related news articles and\nsentences in a binary classification task. Among the submissions, two well\nperforming models have been chosen in order to replace the existing word\nembeddings word2vec and FastTest with ELMo and DistilBERT. Unlike bag of words\nor earlier vector approaches, ELMo and DistilBERT represent words as a sequence\nof vectors by capturing the meaning based on contextual information in the\ntext. Without changing the architecture of the original models other than the\nword embeddings, the implementation of DistilBERT improved the performance\nmeasured on the F1-Score of 0.66 compared to the FastText implementation.\nDistilBERT also outperformed ELMo in both tasks and models. Cleaning the\ndatasets by removing stopwords and lemmatizing the words has been shown to make\nthe models more generalizable across different contexts when training on a\ndataset with Indian news articles and evaluating the models on a dataset with\nnews articles from China.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning has shown great potential in unsupervised sentence\nembedding tasks, e.g., SimCSE. However, We find that these existing solutions\nare heavily affected by superficial features like the length of sentences or\nsyntactic structures. In this paper, we propose a semantics-aware contrastive\nlearning framework for sentence embeddings, termed Pseudo-Token BERT (PT-BERT),\nwhich is able to exploit the pseudo-token space (i.e., latent semantic space)\nrepresentation of a sentence while eliminating the impact of superficial\nfeatures such as sentence length and syntax. Specifically, we introduce an\nadditional pseudo token embedding layer independent of the BERT encoder to map\neach sentence into a sequence of pseudo tokens in a fixed length. Leveraging\nthese pseudo sequences, we are able to construct same-length positive and\nnegative pairs based on the attention mechanism to perform contrastive\nlearning. In addition, we utilize both the gradient-updating and\nmomentum-updating encoders to encode instances while dynamically maintaining an\nadditional queue to store the representation of sentence embeddings, enhancing\nthe encoder's learning performance for negative examples. Experiments show that\nour model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on six standard semantic\ntextual similarity (STS) tasks. Furthermore, experiments on alignments and\nuniformity losses, as well as hard examples with different sentence lengths and\nsyntax, consistently verify the effectiveness of our method.",

    "title": "Multi-modal Graph Learning for Disease Prediction",
    "abstract": "Benefiting from the powerful expressive capability of graphs, graph-based\napproaches have been popularly applied to handle multi-modal medical data and\nachieved impressive performance in various biomedical applications. For disease\nprediction tasks, most existing graph-based methods tend to define the graph\nmanually based on specified modality (e.g., demographic information), and then\nintegrated other modalities to obtain the patient representation by Graph\nRepresentation Learning (GRL). However, constructing an appropriate graph in\nadvance is not a simple matter for these methods. Meanwhile, the complex\ncorrelation between modalities is ignored. These factors inevitably yield the\ninadequacy of providing sufficient information about the patient's condition\nfor a reliable diagnosis. To this end, we propose an end-to-end Multi-modal\nGraph Learning framework (MMGL) for disease prediction with multi-modality. To\neffectively exploit the rich information across multi-modality associated with\nthe disease, modality-aware representation learning is proposed to aggregate\nthe features of each modality by leveraging the correlation and complementarity\nbetween the modalities. Furthermore, instead of defining the graph manually,\nthe latent graph structure is captured through an effective way of adaptive\ngraph learning. It could be jointly optimized with the prediction model, thus\nrevealing the intrinsic connections among samples. Our model is also applicable\nto the scenario of inductive learning for those unseen data. An extensive group\nof experiments on two disease prediction tasks demonstrates that the proposed\nMMGL achieves more favorable performance.

This paper proposes Dual Rank-1 Tensor Attention Module (DRTAM), a\nnovel residual-attention-learning-guided attention module for feed-forward\nconvolutional neural networks. Given a 3D feature tensor map, DRTAM firstly\ngenerates three 2D feature descriptors along three axes. Then, using three\ndescriptors, DRTAM sequentially infers two rank-1 tensor attention maps, the\ninitial attention map and the complement attention map, combines and multiplied\nthem to the input feature map for adaptive feature refinement(see Fig.1(c)). To\ngenerate two attention maps, DRTAM introduces rank-1 tensor attention module\n(RTAM) and residual descriptors extraction module (RDEM): RTAM divides each 2D\nfeature descriptors into several chunks, and generate three factor vectors of a\nrank-1 tensor attention map by employing strip pooling on each chunk so that\nlocal and long-range contextual information can be captured along three\ndimension respectively; RDEM generates three 2D feature descriptors of the\nresidual feature to produce the complement attention map, using three factor\nvectors of the initial attention map and three descriptors of the input\nfeature.

    "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms can produce biased outcome/prediction, typically,\nagainst minorities and under-represented sub-populations. Therefore, fairness\nis emerging as an important requirement for the large scale application of\nmachine learning based technologies. The most commonly used fairness notions\n(e.g. statistical parity, equalized odds, predictive parity, etc.) are\nobservational and rely on mere correlation between variables. These notions\nfail to identify bias in case of statistical anomalies such as Simpson's or\nBerkson's paradoxes. Causality-based fairness notions (e.g. counterfactual\nfairness, no-proxy discrimination, etc.) are immune to such anomalies and hence\nmore reliable to assess fairness. The problem of causality-based fairness\nnotions, however, is that they are defined in terms of quantities (e.g. causal,\ncounterfactual, and path-specific effects) that are not always measurable. This\nis known as the identifiability problem and is the topic of a large body of\nwork in the causal inference literature. This paper is a compilation of the\nmajor identifiability results which are of particular relevance for machine\nlearning fairness. The results are illustrated using a large number of examples\nand causal graphs.

    "abstract": "Relational Keyword Search (R-KwS) systems enable naive/informal users to\nexplore and retrieve information from relational databases without knowing\nschema details or query languages. These systems take the keywords from the\ninput query, locate the elements of the target database that correspond to\nthese keywords, and look for ways to \"connect\" these elements using information\non referential integrity constraints, i.e., key/foreign key pairs. Although\nseveral such systems have been proposed in the literature, most of them only\nsupport queries whose keywords refer to the contents of the target database and\njust very few support queries in which keywords refer to elements of the\ndatabase schema. This paper proposes LATHE, a novel R-KwS designed to support\nsuch queries. To this end, in our work, we first generalize the well-known\nconcepts of Query Matches (QMs) and Candidate Joining Networks (CJNs) to handle\nkeywords referring to schema elements and propose new algorithms to generate\nthem. Then, we introduce an approach to automatically select the CJNs that are\nmore likely to represent the user intent when issuing a keyword query. This\napproach includes two major innovations: a ranking algorithm for selecting\nbetter QMs, yielding the generation of fewer but better CJNs, and an eager\nevaluation strategy for pruning void useless CJNs. We present a comprehensive\nset of experiments performed with query sets and datasets previously used in\nexperiments with state-of-the-art R-KwS systems and methods. Our results\nindicate that LATHE can handle a wider variety of keyword queries while\nremaining highly effective, even for large databases with intricate schemas.",

Utilizing volumetric domain\ndecomposition, the integral is computed over a union of regular boxes (lending\nthe scheme compatibility with adaptive box codes) and triangular regions (which\nmay be potentially curved near boundaries). Singular and near-singular\nquadrature is handled by converting integrals on volumetric regions to line\nintegrals bounding a reference volume cell using cell mappings and elements of\nthe Poincar\\'e lemma, followed by leveraging existing one-dimensional\nnear-singular and singular quadratures appropriate to the singular nature of\nthe kernel.

When trained using standard reinforcement and\nimitation learning methods on a suite of simulated robot manipulation tasks, we\nfind that these architectures achieve significantly higher success rates with\nless data. We also find these architectures enable broader and compositional\ngeneralization, producing policies that extrapolate to different numbers of\nentities than seen in training, and stitch together (i.e. compose) learned\nskills in novel ways.

    "abstract": "Traffic signal control is a significant part of the construction of\nintelligent transportation. An efficient traffic signal control strategy can\nreduce traffic congestion, improve urban road traffic efficiency and facilitate\npeople's lives. Existing reinforcement learning approaches for traffic signal\ncontrol mainly focus on learning through a separate neural network. Such an\nindependent neural network may fall into the local optimum of the training\nresults. Worse more, the collected data can only be sampled once, so the data\nutilization rate is low. Therefore, we propose the Random Ensemble Double DQN\nLight (RELight) model. It can dynamically learn traffic signal control\nstrategies through reinforcement learning and combine random ensemble learning\nto avoid falling into the local optimum to reach the optimal strategy.\nMoreover, we introduce the Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio to control the number of\ndata reuses to improve the problem of low data utilization. In addition, we\nhave conducted sufficient experiments on synthetic data and real-world data to\nprove that our proposed method can achieve better traffic signal control\neffects than the existing optimal methods.",

    "title": "Anti-Oversmoothing in Deep Vision Transformers via the Fourier Domain  Analysis: From Theory to Practice",
    "abstract": "Vision Transformer (ViT) has recently demonstrated promise in computer vision\nproblems. However, unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), it is known that\nthe performance of ViT saturates quickly with depth increasing, due to the\nobserved attention collapse or patch uniformity. Despite a couple of empirical\nsolutions, a rigorous framework studying on this scalability issue remains\nelusive. In this paper, we first establish a rigorous theory framework to\nanalyze ViT features from the Fourier spectrum domain. We show that the\nself-attention mechanism inherently amounts to a low-pass filter, which\nindicates when ViT scales up its depth, excessive low-pass filtering will cause\nfeature maps to only preserve their Direct-Current (DC) component. We then\npropose two straightforward yet effective techniques to mitigate the\nundesirable low-pass limitation. The first technique, termed AttnScale,\ndecomposes a self-attention block into low-pass and high-pass components, then\nrescales and combines these two filters to produce an all-pass self-attention\nmatrix. The second technique, termed FeatScale, re-weights feature maps on\nseparate frequency bands to amplify the high-frequency signals. Both techniques\nare efficient and hyperparameter-free, while effectively overcoming relevant\nViT training artifacts such as attention collapse and patch uniformity. By\nseamlessly plugging in our techniques to multiple ViT variants, we demonstrate\nthat they consistently help ViTs benefit from deeper architectures, bringing up\nto 1.1% performance gains \"for free\" (e.g., with little parameter overhead). We\npublicly release our codes and pre-trained models at\nhttps://github.com/VITA-Group/ViT-Anti-Oversmoothing.",

    "abstract": "Social media platforms can expose influential trends in many aspects of\neveryday life. However, the movements they represent can be contaminated by\ndisinformation. Social bots are one of the significant sources of\ndisinformation in social media. Social bots can pose serious cyber threats to\nsociety and public opinion. This research aims to develop machine learning\nmodels to detect bots based on the extracted user's profile from a Tweet's\ntext. Online users' profile shows the user's personal information, such as age,\ngender, education, and personality. In this work, the user's profile is\nconstructed based on the user's online posts. This work's main contribution is\nthree-fold: First, we aim to improve bot detection through machine learning\nmodels based on the user's personal information generated by the user's online\ncomments. When comparing two online posts, the similarity of personal\ninformation makes it difficult to differentiate a bot from a human user.\nHowever, this research turns personal information similarity among two online\nposts into an advantage for the new bot detection model. The new proposed model\nfor bot detection creates user profiles based on personal information such as\nage, personality, gender, education from users' online posts and introduces a\nmachine learning model to detect social bots with high prediction accuracy\nbased on personal information. Second, create a new public data set that shows\nthe user's profile for more than 6900 Twitter accounts in the Cresci 2017 data\nset.",

This requires, however, that the\nlinkage model can capture the exploitable structure of a problem. Usually, a\nsingle type of linkage structure is attempted to be captured using models such\nas a linkage tree. However, in practice, problems may exhibit multiple linkage\nstructures. This is for instance the case in multi-objective optimization when\nthe objectives have different linkage structures. This cannot be modelled\nsufficiently well when using linkage models that aim at capturing a single type\nof linkage structure, deteriorating the advantages brought by MBEAs. Therefore,\nhere, we introduce linkage kernels, whereby a linkage structure is learned for\neach solution over its local neighborhood. We implement linkage kernels into\nthe MBEA known as GOMEA that was previously found to be highly scalable when\nsolving various problems. We further introduce a novel benchmark function\ncalled Best-of-Traps (BoT) that has an adjustable degree of different linkage\nstructures.

However, the gait\nmotion planning of the quadruped robot is time-consuming. Animals in nature can\nprovide a large amount of gait information for robots to learn and imitate.\nCommon methods learn animal posture with a motion capture system or numerous\nmotion data points. In this paper, we propose a video imitation adaptation\nnetwork (VIAN) that can imitate the action of animals and adapt it to the robot\nfrom a few seconds of video. The deep learning model extracts key points during\nanimal motion from videos. The VIAN eliminates noise and extracts key\ninformation of motion with a motion adaptor, and then applies the extracted\nmovements function as the motion pattern into deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL). To ensure similarity between the learning result and the animal motion\nin the video, we introduce rewards that are based on the consistency of the\nmotion. DRL explores and learns to maintain balance from movement patterns from\nvideos, imitates the action of animals, and eventually, allows the model to\nlearn the gait or skills from short motion videos of different animals and to\ntransfer the motion pattern to the real robot.",

The proposed detection and correction strategies result in\nan improvement of these two evaluation metrics by 61.8% and 61.4% for contour1\nand by 67.8% and 28.4% for contour2. Traditional DTW distance, on the other\nhand, improves by 44.6% for contour1 and 4.0% for contour2.",

Assuming we have as input\na simplicial complex K that approximates the submanifold (such as the Cech\ncomplex or the Rips complex), we recast the reconstruction problem as a L1-norm\nminimization problem in which the optimization variable is a chain of K.\nProviding that K satisfies certain reasonable conditions, we prove that the\nconsidered minimization problem has a unique solution which triangulates the\nsubmanifold and coincides with the flat Delaunay complex introduced and studied\nin a companion paper. Since the objective is a weighted L1-norm and the\ncontraints are linear, the triangulation process can thus be implemented by\nlinear programming.",

Traditional approaches provide\nprecious information; however, they impose challenges to obtaining large-scale\ndata, making it hard to study worldwide patterns. Location-based social\nnetworks (LBSNs) can potentially mitigate such issues due to the relatively low\ncost of acquiring large amounts of behavioral data.

Thus, the present work investigates in which\ncountries the global tourism network measured with an LBSN agreeably reflects\nthe behavior estimated by the World Tourism Organization using traditional\nmethods. Although we could find exceptions, the results suggest that, for most\ncountries, LBSN data can satisfactorily represent the behavior studied.

Frequently, these tasks involve\narticulating objects such as opening or closing a valve.

When the automated fitting is incorrect, the operator can\niteratively intervene with corrections after which the system will refit the\nobject. We present an implementation of our fitting procedure and evaluate it\nwith a user study that shows that it can improve user performance, in measures\nof time on task and task load, ease of use, and usefulness compared to a manual\nregistration approach.

    "abstract": "Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) is a metric for quantifying the distance\nbetween two distributions of images. Given its status as a standard yardstick\nfor ranking models in data-driven generative modeling research, it seems\nimportant that the distance is computed from general, \"vision-related\"\nfeatures. But is it? We observe that FID is essentially a distance between sets\nof ImageNet class probabilities. We trace the reason to the fact that the\nstandard feature space, the penultimate \"pre-logit\" layer of a particular\nInception-V3 classifier network, is only one affine transform away from the\nlogits, i.e., ImageNet classes, and thus, the features are necessarily highly\nspecialized to them. This has unintuitive consequences for the metric's\nsensitivity. For example, when evaluating a model for human faces, we observe\nthat, on average, FID is actually very insensitive to the facial region, and\nthat the probabilities of classes like \"bow tie\" or \"seat belt\" play a much\nlarger role. Further, we show that FID can be significantly reduced -- without\nactually improving the quality of results -- by an attack that first generates\na slightly larger set of candidates, and then chooses a subset that happens to\nmatch the histogram of such \"fringe features\" in the real data. We then\ndemonstrate that this observation has practical relevance in case of ImageNet\npre-training of GANs, where a part of the observed FID improvement turns out\nnot to be real. Our results suggest caution against over-interpreting FID\nimprovements, and underline the need for distribution metrics that are more\nperceptually uniform.",

However, the relations between technical (formalised) and\nethical discourse on fairness are not always clear and productive. Arguing for\nan alternative perspective, we review existing fairness metrics and discuss\nsome common issues. For instance, the fairness of procedures and distributions\nis often formalised and discussed statically, disregarding both structural\npreconditions of the status quo and downstream effects of a given intervention.\nWe then introduce dynamic fairness modelling, a more comprehensive approach\nthat realigns formal fairness metrics with arguments from the ethical\ndiscourse. A dynamic fairness model incorporates (1) ethical goals, (2) formal\nmetrics to quantify decision procedures and outcomes and (3) mid-term or\nlong-term downstream effects. By contextualising these elements of\nfairness-related processes, dynamic fairness modelling explicates formerly\nlatent ethical aspects and thereby provides a helpful tool to navigate\ntrade-offs between different fairness interventions. To illustrate the\nframework, we discuss an example application -- the current European efforts to\nincrease the number of women on company boards, e.g. via quota solutions -- and\npresent early technical work that fits within our framework.",

However, the conventional\ndevice design wisdom is disconnected with system optimization. We report a\ndevice-system co-design methodology to optimize a free-space optical general\nmatrix multiplication (GEMM) hardware accelerator by engineering a spatially\nreconfigurable array made from chalcogenide phase change materials. With a\nhighly-parallelized hardware emulator constructed based on experimental\ninformation, we demonstrate the design of unit device by optimizing GEMM\ncalculation accuracy via reinforcement learning, including deep Q-learning\nneural network, Bayesian optimization, and their cascaded approach, which show\na clear correlation between system performance metrics and physical device\nspecifications. Furthermore, we employ physics-aware training approaches to\ndeploy optimized hardware to the tasks of image classification, materials\ndiscovery, and a closed-loop design of optical ML accelerators. The\ndemonstrated framework offers insights into the co-design of optoelectronic\ndevices and systems with reduced human-supervision and domain-knowledge\nbarriers.",

For the continuous entropy\nanalysis to hold and to ensure Galilean invariance in the divergence cleaning\ntechnique, the GLM-MHD system requires the use of non-conservative terms.\nTraditionally, entropy-stable DG discretizations have used a collocated nodal\nvariant of the DG method, also known as the discontinuous Galerkin spectral\nelement method (DGSEM) on Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) points. Recently, Chan\net al. (\"Efficient Entropy Stable Gauss Collocation Methods\".

Our main contribution is to\nextend the discretization technique of Chan et al. to the non-conservative\nGLM-MHD system.\nWe provide a numerical verification of the entropy behavior and convergence\nproperties of our novel scheme on 3D curvilinear meshes. Moreover, we test the\nrobustness and accuracy of our scheme with a magneto-hydrodynamic\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability problem.

    "title": "Active Evaluation: Efficient NLG Evaluation with Few Pairwise  Comparisons",
    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown the advantages of evaluating NLG systems using\npairwise comparisons as opposed to direct assessment. Given $k$ systems, a\nnaive approach for identifying the top-ranked system would be to uniformly\nobtain pairwise comparisons from all ${k \\choose 2}$ pairs of systems. However,\nthis can be very expensive as the number of human annotations required would\ngrow quadratically with $k$. In this work, we introduce Active Evaluation, a\nframework to efficiently identify the top-ranked system by actively choosing\nsystem pairs for comparison using dueling bandit algorithms. We perform\nextensive experiments with 13 dueling bandits algorithms on 13 NLG evaluation\ndatasets spanning 5 tasks and show that the number of human annotations can be\nreduced by 80%. To further reduce the number of human annotations, we propose\nmodel-based dueling bandit algorithms which combine automatic evaluation\nmetrics with human evaluations. Specifically, we eliminate sub-optimal systems\neven before the human annotation process and perform human evaluations only on\ntest examples where the automatic metric is highly uncertain. This reduces the\nnumber of human annotations required further by 89%. In effect, we show that\nidentifying the top-ranked system requires only a few hundred human\nannotations, which grow linearly with $k$. Lastly, we provide practical\nrecommendations and best practices to identify the top-ranked system\nefficiently. Our code has been made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/akashkm99/duelnlg",

    "abstract": "Among the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed within the\n2030 Agenda and adopted by all the United Nations member states, the 13$^{th}$\nSDG is a call for action to combat climate change for a better world. In this\nwork, we provide an overview of areas in which audio intelligence -- a powerful\nbut in this context so far hardly considered technology -- can contribute to\novercome climate-related challenges. We categorise potential computer audition\napplications according to the five elements of earth, water, air, fire, and\naether, proposed by the ancient Greeks in their five element theory; this\ncategorisation serves as a framework to discuss computer audition in relation\nto different ecological aspects. Earth and water are concerned with the early\ndetection of environmental changes and, thus, with the protection of humans and\nanimals, as well as the monitoring of land and aquatic organisms. Aerial audio\nis used to monitor and obtain information about bird and insect populations.\nFurthermore, acoustic measures can deliver relevant information for the\nmonitoring and forecasting of weather and other meteorological phenomena. The\nfourth considered element is fire. Due to the burning of fossil fuels, the\nresulting increase in CO$_2$ emissions and the associated rise in temperature,\nfire is used as a symbol for man-made climate change and in this context\nincludes the monitoring of noise pollution, machines, as well as the early\ndetection of wildfires. In all these areas, computer audition can help\ncounteract climate change. Aether then corresponds to the technology itself\nthat makes this possible. This work explores these areas and discusses\npotential applications, while positioning computer audition in relation to\nmethodological alternatives.",

Early methods mostly involved handcrafted priors\nincluding normalized sparsity, L0 gradients, dark channel priors, etc.\nRecently, deep neural networks have been used to learn various image priors but\ndo not guarantee to generalize. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that\nembeds a task-agnostic prior into a transformer. Our approach, named\nTask-Agnostic Prior Embedding (TAPE), consists of three stages, namely,\ntask-agnostic pre-training, task-agnostic fine-tuning, and task-specific\nfine-tuning, where the first one embeds prior knowledge about natural images\ninto the transformer and the latter two extracts the knowledge to assist\ndownstream image restoration. Experiments on various types of degradation\nvalidate the effectiveness of TAPE. The image restoration performance in terms\nof PSNR is improved by as much as 1.45 dB and even outperforms task-specific\nalgorithms. More importantly, TAPE shows the ability of disentangling\ngeneralized image priors from degraded images, which enjoys favorable transfer\nability to unknown downstream tasks.",

Most recent studies in visual reasoning are dedicated\nto improving the accuracy of predicted answers, and less attention is paid to\nexplaining the rationales behind the decisions. As a result, they commonly take\nadvantage of spurious biases instead of actually reasoning on the\nvisual-textual data, and have yet developed the capability to explain their\ndecision making by considering key information from both modalities. This paper\naims to close the gap from three distinct perspectives: first, we define a new\ntype of multi-modal explanations that explain the decisions by progressively\ntraversing the reasoning process and grounding keywords in the images. We\ndevelop a functional program to sequentially execute different reasoning steps\nand construct a new dataset with 1,040,830 multi-modal explanations. Second, we\nidentify the critical need to tightly couple important components across the\nvisual and textual modalities for explaining the decisions, and propose a novel\nexplanation generation method that explicitly models the pairwise\ncorrespondence between words and regions of interest. It improves the visual\ngrounding capability by a considerable margin, resulting in enhanced\ninterpretability and reasoning performance. Finally, with our new data and\nmethod, we perform extensive analyses to study the effectiveness of our\nexplanation under different settings, including multi-task learning and\ntransfer learning.

We show that adding a consistency loss,\nensuring that the predictions of the network are consistent over consecutive\ntraining epochs, is a simple yet effective method to train multi-label\nclassifiers in a weakly supervised setting. We further extend this approach\nspatially, by ensuring consistency of the spatial feature maps produced over\nconsecutive training epochs, maintaining per-class running-average heatmaps for\neach training image. We show that this spatial consistency loss further\nimproves the multi-label mAP of the classifiers. In addition, we show that this\nmethod overcomes shortcomings of the \"crop\" data-augmentation by recovering\ncorrect supervision signal even when most of the single ground truth object is\ncropped out of the input image by the data augmentation. We demonstrate gains\nof the consistency and spatial consistency losses over the binary cross-entropy\nbaseline, and over competing methods, on MS-COCO and Pascal VOC.

Also, the improved result\nholds for weighted vertex expansion, answering an open question by\nOlesker-Taylor and Zanetti. Building on this connection, we then develop a new\nspectral theory for vertex expansion. We discover that several interesting\ngeneralizations of Cheeger inequalities relating edge conductances and\neigenvalues have a close analog in relating vertex expansions and reweighted\neigenvalues. These include an analog of Trevisan's result on bipartiteness, an\nanalog of higher order Cheeger's inequality, and an analog of improved\nCheeger's inequality.\nFinally, inspired by this connection, we present negative evidence to the\n$0/1$-polytope edge expansion conjecture by Mihail and Vazirani. We construct\n$0/1$-polytopes whose graphs have very poor vertex expansion. This implies that\nthe fastest mixing time to the uniform distribution on the vertices of these\n$0/1$-polytopes is almost linear in the graph size.

Our\nexperiments show that even without default augmentations, we can learn an\naugmentation policy that achieves strong performance with that of previous\nworks. Extensive ablation studies show that the regularized gradient matching\nis an effective search method for data augmentation policies.

    "abstract": "This paper shows that self-supervised visual pre-training from real-world\nimages is effective for learning motor control tasks from pixels. We first\ntrain the visual representations by masked modeling of natural images. We then\nfreeze the visual encoder and train neural network controllers on top with\nreinforcement learning. We do not perform any task-specific fine-tuning of the\nencoder; the same visual representations are used for all motor control tasks.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first self-supervised model to\nexploit real-world images at scale for motor control. To accelerate progress in\nlearning from pixels, we contribute a benchmark suite of hand-designed tasks\nvarying in movements, scenes, and robots. Without relying on labels,\nstate-estimation, or expert demonstrations, we consistently outperform\nsupervised encoders by up to 80% absolute success rate, sometimes even matching\nthe oracle state performance. We also find that in-the-wild images, e.g., from\nYouTube or Egocentric videos, lead to better visual representations for various\nmanipulation tasks than ImageNet images.",

    "abstract": "Of theories for why large-scale machine learning models generalize despite\nbeing vastly overparameterized, which of their assumptions are needed to\ncapture the qualitative phenomena of generalization in the real world? On one\nhand, we find that most theoretical analyses fall short of capturing these\nqualitative phenomena even for kernel regression, when applied to kernels\nderived from large-scale neural networks (e.g., ResNet-50) and real data (e.g.,\nCIFAR-100). On the other hand, we find that the classical GCV estimator (Craven\nand Wahba, 1978) accurately predicts generalization risk even in such\noverparameterized settings. To bolster this empirical finding, we prove that\nthe GCV estimator converges to the generalization risk whenever a local random\nmatrix law holds. Finally, we apply this random matrix theory lens to explain\nwhy pretrained representations generalize better as well as what factors govern\nscaling laws for kernel regression. Our findings suggest that random matrix\ntheory, rather than just being a toy model, may be central to understanding the\nproperties of neural representations in practice.",

Glioblastomas appear as heterogeneous\nnecrotic masses with irregular peripheral enhancement, surrounded by vasogenic\nedema. The current standard of care includes surgical resection, radiotherapy\nand chemotherapy, which require accurate segmentation of brain tumor\nsubregions. For effective treatment planning, it is vital to identify the\nmethylation status of the promoter of Methylguanine Methyltransferase (MGMT), a\npositive prognostic factor for chemotherapy. However, current methods for brain\ntumor segmentation are tedious, subjective and not scalable, and current\ntechniques to determine the methylation status of MGMT promoter involve\nsurgically invasive procedures, which are expensive and time consuming. Hence\nthere is a pressing need to develop automated tools to segment brain tumors and\nnon-invasive methods to predict methylation status of MGMT promoter, to\nfacilitate better treatment planning and improve survival rate. I created an\nintegrated diagnostics solution powered by Artificial Intelligence to\nautomatically segment brain tumor subregions and predict MGMT promoter\nmethylation status, using brain MRI scans. My AI solution is proven on large\ndatasets with performance exceeding current standards and field tested with\ndata from teaching files of local neuroradiologists.

A core part of\ndigital healthcare twins is model-based data synthesis, which permits the\ngeneration of realistic medical signals without requiring to cope with the\nmodelling complexity of anatomical and biochemical phenomena producing them in\nreality. Unfortunately, algorithms for cardiac data synthesis have been so far\nscarcely studied in the literature. An important imaging modality in the\ncardiac examination is three-directional CINE multi-slice myocardial velocity\nmapping (3Dir MVM), which provides a quantitative assessment of cardiac motion\nin three orthogonal directions of the left ventricle. The long acquisition time\nand complex acquisition produce make it more urgent to produce synthetic\ndigital twins of this imaging modality. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep\nlearning (HDL) network, especially for synthetic 3Dir MVM data. Our algorithm\nis featured by a hybrid UNet and a Generative Adversarial Network with a\nforeground-background generation scheme.

Many deep neural network based methods have been proposed to tackle this\nchallenging problem without considering the image degradation model. However,\nthey largely rely on the training sets and often fail to handle images with\nunseen blur kernels during inference. Deep unfolding methods have also been\nproposed to perform BISR by utilizing the degradation model. Nonetheless, the\nexisting deep unfolding methods cannot explicitly solve the data term of the\nunfolding objective function, limiting their capability in blur kernel\nestimation.

The UDKE based BISR method can\njointly learn image and kernel priors in an end-to-end manner, and it can\neffectively exploit the information in both training data and image degradation\nmodel.

By\nperforming the pretext task of reconstructing the original image from only\npartial observations, the encoder, which is a ViT, is encouraged to aggregate\ncontextual information to infer content in masked image regions. We believe\nthat this context aggregation ability is also essential to the medical image\ndomain where each anatomical structure is functionally and mechanically\nconnected to other structures and regions. However, there is no ImageNet-scale\nmedical image dataset for pre-training. Thus, in this paper, we investigate a\nself pre-training paradigm with MAE for medical images, i.e., models are\npre-trained on the same target dataset. To validate the MAE self pre-training,\nwe consider three diverse medical image tasks including chest X-ray disease\nclassification, CT abdomen multi-organ segmentation and MRI brain tumor\nsegmentation. It turns out MAE self pre-training benefits all the tasks\nmarkedly. Specifically, the mAUC on lung disease classification is increased by\n9.4%. The average DSC on brain tumor segmentation is improved from 77.4% to\n78.9%. Most interestingly, on the small-scale multi-organ segmentation dataset\n(N=30), the average DSC improves from 78.8% to 83.5% and the HD95 is reduced by\n60%, indicating its effectiveness in limited data scenarios. The segmentation\nand classification results reveal the promising potential of MAE self\npre-training for medical image analysis.",

Adapting the source model to target data\ndistribution at test-time is an efficient solution for the data-shift problem.\nPrevious methods solve this by adapting the model to target distribution by\nusing techniques like entropy minimization or regularization. In these methods,\nthe models are still updated by back-propagation using an unsupervised loss on\ncomplete test data distribution. In real-world clinical settings, it makes more\nsense to adapt a model to a new test image on-the-fly and avoid model update\nduring inference due to privacy concerns and lack of computing resource at\ndeployment. To this end, we propose a new setting - On-the-Fly Adaptation which\nis zero-shot and episodic (i.e., the model is adapted to a single image at a\ntime and also does not perform any back-propagation during test-time). To\nachieve this, we propose a new framework called Adaptive UNet where each\nconvolutional block is equipped with an adaptive batch normalization layer to\nadapt the features with respect to a domain code. The domain code is generated\nusing a pre-trained encoder trained on a large corpus of medical images. During\ntest-time, the model takes in just the new test image and generates a domain\ncode to adapt the features of source model according to the test data. We\nvalidate the performance on both 2D and 3D data distribution shifts where we\nget a better performance compared to previous test-time adaptation methods.\nCode is available at https://github.com/jeya-maria-jose/On-The-Fly-Adaptation",

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 crisis, educational institutions worldwide shifted from\nface-to-face instruction to emergency remote teaching (ERT) modalities. In this\nforced and sudden transition, teachers and students did not have the\nopportunity to acquire the knowledge or skills necessary for online learning\nmodalities implemented through a learning management system (LMS). Therefore,\nundergraduate teachers tend to mainly use an LMS as an information repository\nand rarely promote virtual interactions among students, thus limiting the\nbenefits of collective intelligence for students. We analyzed data on 7,528\nundergraduate students and found that cooperative and consensus dynamics among\nuniversity students in discussion forums positively affect their final GPA,\nwith a steeper effect for students with low academic performance during high\nschool. These results hold above and beyond socioeconomic and other LMS\nactivity confounders. Furthermore, using natural language processing, we show\nthat first-year students with low academic performance during high school are\nexposed to more content-intensive posts in discussion forums, leading to\nsignificantly higher university GPAs than their low-performance peers in high\nschool. We expect these results to motivate higher education teachers worldwide\nto promote cooperative and consensus dynamics among students using tools such\nas forum discussions in their classes to reap the benefits of social learning\nand collective intelligence.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a data-dependent approximation of the forward\nkinematics map for certain types of animal motion models. It is assumed that\nmotions are supported on a low-dimensional, unknown configuration manifold $Q$\nthat is regularly embedded in high dimensional Euclidean space\n$X:=\\mathbb{R}^d$. This paper introduces a method to estimate forward\nkinematics from the unknown configuration submanifold $Q$ to an $n$-dimensional\nEuclidean space $Y:=\\mathbb{R}^n$ of observations. A known reproducing kernel\nHilbert space (RKHS) is defined over the ambient space $X$ in terms of a known\nkernel function, and computations are performed using the known kernel defined\non the ambient space $X$. Estimates are constructed using a certain\ndata-dependent approximation of the Koopman operator defined in terms of the\nknown kernel on $X$. However, the rate of convergence of approximations is\nstudied in the space of restrictions to the unknown manifold $Q$. Strong rates\nof convergence are derived in terms of the fill distance of samples in the\nunknown configuration manifold, provided that a novel regularity result holds\nfor the Koopman operator. Additionally, we show that the derived rates of\nconvergence can be applied in some cases to estimates generated by the extended\ndynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) method. We illustrate characteristics of the\nestimates for simulated data as well as samples collected during motion capture\nexperiments.",

Brain extraction is an essential first step in most\nneuroimaging pipelines; however, it can be challenging in the presence of\nsevere pathology and when dataset quality is highly variable. Convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) can improve accuracy and reduce operator time,\nfacilitating high throughput preclinical studies. As part of an ongoing\npreclinical stroke imaging study, we developed a deep-learning mouse brain\nextraction tool by using a U-net CNN. While previous studies have evaluated\nU-net architectures, we sought to evaluate their practical performance across\ndata types. We ask how performance is affected with data across: six imaging\ncenters, two time points after experimental stroke, and across four MRI\ncontrasts. We trained, validated, and tested a typical U-net model on 240\nmultimodal MRI datasets including quantitative multi-echo T2 and apparent\ndiffusivity coefficient (ADC) maps, and performed qualitative evaluation with a\nlarge preclinical stroke database (N=1,368). We describe the design and\ndevelopment of this system, and report our findings linking data\ncharacteristics to segmentation performance. We consistently found high\naccuracy and ability of the U-net architecture to generalize performance in a\nrange of 95-97% accuracy, with only modest reductions in performance based on\nlower fidelity imaging hardware and brain pathology.

In this work, we introduce a new method -- sparse\nHamiltonian flows -- that addresses all three of these challenges. The method\ninvolves first subsampling the data uniformly, and then optimizing a\nHamiltonian flow parametrized by coreset weights and including periodic\nmomentum quasi-refreshment steps. Theoretical results show that the method\nenables an exponential compression of the dataset in a representative model,\nand that the quasi-refreshment steps reduce the KL divergence to the target.\nReal and synthetic experiments demonstrate that sparse Hamiltonian flows\nprovide accurate posterior approximations with significantly reduced runtime\ncompared with competing dynamical-system-based inference methods.",

Previous studies have established several methods for\nCBCT segmentation using deep learning. However, the inherent resolution\ndiscrepancy of CBCT and the loss of occlusal and dentition information largely\nlimited its clinical applicability. Here, we present a Deep Dental Multimodal\nAnalysis (DDMA) framework consisting of a CBCT segmentation model, an intraoral\nscan (IOS) segmentation model (the most accurate digital dental model), and a\nfusion model to generate 3D fused crown-root-bone structures with high fidelity\nand accurate occlusal and dentition information. Our model was trained with a\nlarge-scale dataset with 503 CBCT and 28,559 IOS meshes manually annotated by\nexperienced human experts. For CBCT segmentation, we use a five-fold cross\nvalidation test, each with 50 CBCT, and our model achieves an average Dice\ncoefficient and IoU of 93.99% and 88.68%, respectively, significantly\noutperforming the baselines. For IOS segmentations, our model achieves an mIoU\nof 93.07% and 95.70% on the maxillary and mandible on a test set of 200 IOS\nmeshes, which are 1.77% and 3.52% higher than the state-of-art method. Our DDMA\nframework takes about 20 to 25 minutes to generate the fused 3D mesh model\nfollowing the sequential processing order, compared to over 5 hours by human\nexperts. Notably, our framework has been incorporated into a software by a\nclear aligner manufacturer, and real-world clinical cases demonstrate that our\nmodel can visualize crown-root-bone structures during the entire orthodontic\ntreatment and can predict risks like dehiscence and fenestration. These\nfindings demonstrate the potential of multi-modal deep learning to improve the\nquality of digital dental models and help dentists make better clinical\ndecisions.",

We show that this requires\naddressing three sources of invariance: shifts in time, space, and total\npopulation size (or mass/amplitude). Here we draw inspiration from dynamic time\nwarping (DTW), optimal transport (OT) theory and its unbalanced extension (UOT)\nto propose a criterion that can address all three issues. This proposal\nleverages a smooth formulation of DTW (Soft-DTW) that is shown to capture\ntemporal shifts, and UOT to handle both variations in space and size. Our\nproposed loss can be used to define spatio-temporal barycenters as Fr\\'echet\nmeans. Using Fenchel duality, we show how these barycenters can be computed\nefficiently, in parallel, via a novel variant of entropy-regularized debiased\nUOT. Experiments on handwritten letters and brain imaging data confirm our\ntheoretical findings and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed loss for\nspatio-temporal data.",

    "abstract": "Volumetric image compression has become an urgent task to effectively\ntransmit and store images produced in biological research and clinical\npractice. At present, the most commonly used volumetric image compression\nmethods are based on wavelet transform, such as JP3D. However, JP3D employs an\nideal, separable, global, and fixed wavelet basis to convert input images from\npixel domain to frequency domain, which seriously limits its performance. In\nthis paper, we first design a 3-D trained wavelet-like transform to enable\nsignal-dependent and non-separable transform. Then, an affine wavelet basis is\nintroduced to capture the various local correlations in different regions of\nvolumetric images. Furthermore, we embed the proposed wavelet-like transform to\nan end-to-end compression framework called aiWave to enable an adaptive\ncompression scheme for various datasets. Last but not least, we introduce the\nweight sharing strategies of the affine wavelet-like transform according to the\nvolumetric data characteristics in the axial direction to reduce the amount of\nparameters. The experimental results show that: 1) when cooperating our trained\n3-D affine wavelet-like transform with a simple factorized entropy module,\naiWave performs better than JP3D and is comparable in terms of encoding and\ndecoding complexities; 2) when adding a context module to further remove signal\nredundancy, aiWave can achieve a much better performance than HEVC.",

As such, existing\ninference methods tend to yield very noisy and underestimated OEF maps, while\noverestimating DBV.\nThis work describes a novel probabilistic machine learning approach that can\ninfer plausible distributions of OEF and DBV. Initially, we create a model that\nproduces informative voxelwise prior distribution based on synthetic training\ndata. Contrary to prior work, we model the joint distribution of OEF and DBV\nthrough a scaled multivariate logit-Normal distribution, which enables the\nvalues to be constrained within a plausible range. The prior distribution model\nis used to train an efficient amortized variational Bayesian inference model.\nThis model learns to infer OEF and DBV by predicting real image data, with few\ntraining data required, using the signal equations as a forward model.\nWe demonstrate that our approach enables the inference of smooth OEF and DBV\nmaps, with a physiologically plausible distribution that can be adapted through\nspecification of an informative prior distribution. Other benefits include\nmodel comparison (via the evidence lower bound) and uncertainty quantification\nfor identifying image artefacts. Results are demonstrated on a small study\ncomparing subjects undergoing hyperventilation and at rest.

The method is based on finding a\nsuitable representation of points by fuzzy affiliations with respect to\nlandmark points using the Scalable Probabilistic Approximation algorithm. This\nis followed by the construction of a linear mapping between these affiliations\nfor different variables and forward in time. This linear mapping can be\ndirectly interpreted in light of unidirectional dependencies and relevant\nproperties of it are quantified. These quantifications then serve as measures\nfor the influences between variables of the dynamics. The validity of the\nmethod is demonstrated with theoretical results and on several numerical\nexamples, including real-world basketball player movement.",

For a given\ngraph topology, these algorithms allow for the prediction of formed opinions.\nIn this work, we study the inverse problem. Given a social learning model and\nobservations of the evolution of beliefs over time, we aim at identifying the\nunderlying graph topology. The learned graph allows for the inference of\npairwise influence between agents, the overall influence agents have over the\nbehavior of the network, as well as the flow of information through the social\nnetwork. The proposed algorithm is online in nature and can adapt dynamically\nto changes in the graph topology or the true hypothesis.",

    "title": "ROOD-MRI: Benchmarking the robustness of deep learning segmentation  models to out-of-distribution and corrupted data in MRI",
    "abstract": "Deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) have moved to the forefront of medical\nimage analysis due to their success in classification, segmentation, and\ndetection challenges. A principal challenge in large-scale deployment of DNNs\nin neuroimage analysis is the potential for shifts in signal-to-noise ratio,\ncontrast, resolution, and presence of artifacts from site to site due to\nvariances in scanners and acquisition protocols. DNNs are famously susceptible\nto these distribution shifts in computer vision. Currently, there are no\nbenchmarking platforms or frameworks to assess the robustness of new and\nexisting models to specific distribution shifts in MRI, and accessible\nmulti-site benchmarking datasets are still scarce or task-specific. To address\nthese limitations, we propose ROOD-MRI: a platform for benchmarking the\nRobustness of DNNs to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, corruptions, and\nartifacts in MRI. The platform provides modules for generating benchmarking\ndatasets using transforms that model distribution shifts in MRI,\nimplementations of newly derived benchmarking metrics for image segmentation,\nand examples for using the methodology with new models and tasks. We apply our\nmethodology to hippocampus, ventricle, and white matter hyperintensity\nsegmentation in several large studies, providing the hippocampus dataset as a\npublicly available benchmark. By evaluating modern DNNs on these datasets, we\ndemonstrate that they are highly susceptible to distribution shifts and\ncorruptions in MRI. We show that while data augmentation strategies can\nsubstantially improve robustness to OOD data for anatomical segmentation tasks,\nmodern DNNs using augmentation still lack robustness in more challenging\nlesion-based segmentation tasks. We finally benchmark U-Nets and\ntransformer-based models, finding consistent differences in robustness to\nparticular classes of transforms across architectures.",

    "abstract": "Ultra-widefield (UWF) imaging is a promising modality that captures a larger\nretinal field of view compared to traditional fundus photography. Previous\nstudies showed that deep learning (DL) models are effective for detecting\nretinal disease in UWF images, but primarily considered individual diseases\nunder less-than-realistic conditions (excluding images with other diseases,\nartefacts, comorbidities, or borderline cases; and balancing healthy and\ndiseased images) and did not systematically investigate which regions of the\nUWF images are relevant for disease detection. We first improve on the state of\nthe field by proposing a DL model that can recognise multiple retinal diseases\nunder more realistic conditions. We then use global explainability methods to\nidentify which regions of the UWF images the model generally attends to. Our\nmodel performs very well, separating between healthy and diseased retinas with\nan area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9206 on an internal test set, and an AUC of\n0.9841 on a challenging, external test set. When diagnosing specific diseases,\nthe model attends to regions where we would expect those diseases to occur. We\nfurther identify the posterior pole as the most important region in a purely\ndata-driven fashion. Surprisingly, 10% of the image around the posterior pole\nis sufficient for achieving comparable performance to having the full images\navailable.",
