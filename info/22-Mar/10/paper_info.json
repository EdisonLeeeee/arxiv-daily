    "abstract": "Few-Shot Learning refers to the problem of learning the underlying pattern in\nthe data just from a few training samples. Requiring a large number of data\nsamples, many deep learning solutions suffer from data hunger and extensively\nhigh computation time and resources. Furthermore, data is often not available\ndue to not only the nature of the problem or privacy concerns but also the cost\nof data preparation. Data collection, preprocessing, and labeling are strenuous\nhuman tasks. Therefore, few-shot learning that could drastically reduce the\nturnaround time of building machine learning applications emerges as a low-cost\nsolution. This survey paper comprises a representative list of recently\nproposed few-shot learning algorithms. Given the learning dynamics and\ncharacteristics, the approaches to few-shot learning problems are discussed in\nthe perspectives of meta-learning, transfer learning, and hybrid approaches\n(i.e., different variations of the few-shot learning problem).",

    "abstract": "One of the most critical challenges in deep reinforcement learning is to\nmaintain the long-term exploration capability of the agent. To tackle this\nproblem, it has been recently proposed to provide intrinsic rewards for the\nagent to encourage exploration. However, most existing intrinsic reward-based\nmethods proposed in the literature fail to provide sustainable exploration\nincentives, a problem known as vanishing rewards. In addition, these\nconventional methods incur complex models and additional memory in their\nlearning procedures, resulting in high computational complexity and low\nrobustness. In this work, a novel intrinsic reward module based on the R\\'enyi\nentropy is proposed to provide high-quality intrinsic rewards. It is shown that\nthe proposed method actually generalizes the existing state entropy\nmaximization methods. In particular, a $k$-nearest neighbor estimator is\nintroduced for entropy estimation while a $k$-value search method is designed\nto guarantee the estimation accuracy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate\nthat the proposed R\\'enyi entropy-based method can achieve higher performance\nas compared to existing schemes.",

In this paper, we\npropose UENAS, an evolution-based NAS framework with a broader search space\nthat supports optimizing network architectures, pruning strategies, and\nhyperparameters simultaneously. To alleviate the huge search cost caused by the\nexpanded search space, three strategies are adopted: First, an adaptive pruning\nstrategy that iteratively trims the average model size in the population\nwithout compromising performance. Second, child networks share weights of\noverlapping layers with pre-trained parent networks to reduce the training\nepochs. Third, an online predictor scores the joint representations of\narchitecture, pruning strategy, and hyperparameters to filter out inferior\ncombos. By the proposed three strategies, the search efficiency is\nsignificantly improved and more well-performed compact networks with tailored\nhyper-parameters are derived.

    "abstract": "In Reinforcement Learning interpretability generally means to provide insight\ninto the agent's mechanisms such that its decisions are understandable by an\nexpert upon inspection. This definition, with the resulting methods from the\nliterature, may however fall short for online settings where the fluency of\ninteractions prohibits deep inspections of the decision-making algorithm. To\nsupport interpretability in online settings it is useful to borrow from the\nExplainable Planning literature methods that focus on the legibility of the\nagent, by making its intention easily discernable in an observer model. As we\npropose in this paper, injecting legible behavior inside an agent's policy\ndoesn't require modify components of its learning algorithm. Rather, the\nagent's optimal policy can be regularized for legibility by evaluating how the\npolicy may produce observations that would make an observer infer an incorrect\npolicy. In our formulation, the decision boundary introduced by legibility\nimpacts the states in which the agent's policy returns an action that has high\nlikelihood also in other policies. In these cases, a trade-off between such\naction, and legible/sub-optimal action is made.",

In the time-series classification problem, many\nresearchers typically use 1D convolutional neural networks (1DCNNs) based on\nthe SL approach with a single client to reduce the computational overhead at\nthe client-side while still preserving data privacy.

Existing\napproaches of MAS are largely based on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(MADRL). Although the Deep Neural Network (DNN) of MABRL is effective, the\ntraining time is long, and the parameters are difficult to trace. Recently,\nBroad Learning Systems (BLS) provided a selective way for learning in the deep\nneural networks by a flat network. Moreover, Broad Reinforcement Learning (BRL)\nextends BLS in Single Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (SADRL) problem with\npromising results. However, BRL does not focus on the intricate structures and\ninteraction of agents. Motivated by the feature of MADRL and the issue of BRL,\nwe propose a Multi-Agent Broad Reinforcement Learning (MABRL) framework to\nexplore the function of BLS in MAS. Firstly, unlike most existing MADRL\napproaches, which use a series of deep neural networks structures, we model\neach agent with broad networks.

The IDS was then tested and evaluated based on\nF-Measure (f1), as was the standard when evaluating imbalanced data. Two rounds\nof tests were performed, a partial dataset for minimizing bias, and the full\nBoT-IoT dataset for exploring big data and ML capabilities in a security\nsetting. For the partial dataset, the Random Forest algorithm had the highest\nperformance for binary classification at an average f1 measure of 99.7%, as\nwell as 99.6% for main category classification, and an 88.5% f1 measure for sub\ncategory classification.

The dependency in this model arises when tying the travelling\ntime of the \"thief\" to the weight of the knapsack. However, other forms of\ndependency as well as combinations of dependencies should be considered for\ninvestigation, as they are often found in complex real-world problems. Our goal\nis to study the impact of different forms of dependency in the TTP using a\nsimple local search algorithm. To achieve this, we use Local Optima Networks, a\ntechnique for analysing the fitness landscape.",

    "abstract": "Since data is often stored in different sources, it needs to be integrated to\ngather a global view that is required in order to create value and derive\nknowledge from it. A critical step in data integration is schema matching which\naims to find semantic correspondences between elements of two schemata. In\norder to reduce the manual effort involved in schema matching, many solutions\nfor the automatic determination of schema correspondences have already been\ndeveloped.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end approach for schema matching\nbased on neural embeddings. The main idea is to use a two-step approach\nconsisting of a table matching step followed by an attribute matching step. In\nboth steps we use embeddings on different levels either representing the whole\ntable or single attributes. Our results show that our approach is able to\ndetermine correspondences in a robust and reliable way and compared to\ntraditional schema matching approaches can find non-trivial correspondences.",

    "abstract": "Accurate emotion classification for online reviews is vital for business\norganizations to gain deeper insights into markets. Although deep learning has\nbeen successfully implemented in this area, accuracy and processing time are\nstill major problems preventing it from reaching its full potential. This paper\nproposes an Enhanced Leaky Rectified Linear Unit activation and Weighted Loss\n(ELReLUWL) algorithm for enhanced text emotion classification and faster\nparameter convergence speed. This algorithm includes the definition of the\ninflection point and the slope for inputs on the left side of the inflection\npoint to avoid gradient saturation. It also considers the weight of samples\nbelonging to each class to compensate for the influence of data imbalance.\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with the proposed algorithm to\nincrease the classification accuracy and decrease the processing time by\neliminating the gradient saturation problem and minimizing the negative effect\nof data imbalance, demonstrated on a binary sentiment problem. The results show\nthat the proposed solution achieves better classification performance in\ndifferent data scenarios and different review types. The proposed model takes\nless convergence time to achieve model optimization with seven epochs against\nthe current convergence time of 11.5 epochs on average. The proposed solution\nimproves accuracy and reduces the processing time of text emotion\nclassification. The solution provides an average class accuracy of 96.63%\nagainst a current average accuracy of 91.56%. It also provides a processing\ntime of 23.3 milliseconds compared to the current average processing time of\n33.2 milliseconds. Finally, this study solves the issues of gradient saturation\nand data imbalance. It enhances overall average class accuracy and decreases\nprocessing time.",

    "abstract": "Code quality remains an abstract concept that fails to get traction at the\nbusiness level. Consequently, software companies keep trading code quality for\ntime-to-market and new features. The resulting technical debt is estimated to\nwaste up to 42% of developers' time. At the same time, there is a global\nshortage of software developers, meaning that developer productivity is key to\nsoftware businesses. Our overall mission is to make code quality a business\nconcern, not just a technical aspect. Our first goal is to understand how code\nquality impacts 1) the number of reported defects, 2) the time to resolve\nissues, and 3) the predictability of resolving issues on time. We analyze 39\nproprietary production codebases from a variety of domains using the CodeScene\ntool based on a combination of source code analysis, version-control mining,\nand issue information from Jira. By analyzing activity in 30,737 files, we find\nthat low quality code contains 15 times more defects than high quality code.\nFurthermore, resolving issues in low quality code takes on average 124% more\ntime in development. Finally, we report that issue resolutions in low quality\ncode involve higher uncertainty manifested as 9 times longer maximum cycle\ntimes. This study provides evidence that code quality cannot be dismissed as a\ntechnical concern. With 15 times fewer defects, twice the development speed,\nand substantially more predictable issue resolution times, the business\nadvantage of high quality code should be unmistakably clear.",

    "abstract": "A framework is proposed for generative models as a basis for digital twins or\nmirrors of structures. The proposal is based on the premise that deterministic\nmodels cannot account for the uncertainty present in most structural modelling\napplications. Two different types of generative models are considered here. The\nfirst is a physics-based model based on the stochastic finite element (SFE)\nmethod, which is widely used when modelling structures that have material and\nloading uncertainties imposed. Such models can be calibrated according to data\nfrom the structure and would be expected to outperform any other model if the\nmodelling accurately captures the true underlying physics of the structure. The\npotential use of SFE models as digital mirrors is illustrated via application\nto a linear structure with stochastic material properties. For situations where\nthe physical formulation of such models does not suffice, a data-driven\nframework is proposed, using machine learning and conditional generative\nadversarial networks (cGANs). The latter algorithm is used to learn the\ndistribution of the quantity of interest in a structure with material\nnonlinearities and uncertainties. For the examples considered in this work, the\ndata-driven cGANs model outperform the physics-based approach. Finally, an\nexample is shown where the two methods are coupled such that a hybrid model\napproach is demonstrated.",

Existing technologies, such as AutoML, make it\neasier to design and train models automatically, but there is a lack of a\nsimilar level of capabilities to extract data-centric insights. Manual\nstratification of tabular data per a feature (e.g., gender) is limited to scale\nup for higher feature dimension, which could be addressed using automatic\ndiscovery of divergent subgroups. Nonetheless, these automatic discovery\ntechniques often search across potentially exponential combinations of features\nthat could be simplified using a preceding feature selection step. Existing\nfeature selection techniques for tabular data often involve fitting a\nparticular model in order to select important features. However, such\nmodel-based selection is prone to model-bias and spurious correlations in\naddition to requiring extra resource to design, fine-tune and train a model. In\nthis paper, we propose a model-free and sparsity-based automatic feature\nselection (SAFS) framework to facilitate automatic discovery of divergent\nsubgroups. Different from filter-based selection techniques, we exploit the\nsparsity of objective measures among feature values to rank and select\nfeatures. We validated SAFS across two publicly available datasets (MIMIC-III\nand Allstate Claims) and compared it with six existing feature selection\nmethods. SAFS achieves a reduction of feature selection time by a factor of 81x\nand 104x, averaged cross the existing methods in the MIMIC-III and Claims\ndatasets respectively. SAFS-selected features are also shown to achieve\ncompetitive detection performance, e.g., 18.3% of features selected by SAFS in\nthe Claims dataset detected divergent samples similar to those detected by\nusing the whole features with a Jaccard similarity of 0.95 but with a 16x\nreduction in detection time.",

Different from most prevalent black-box attacks that make\nuse of substitute models or gradient estimation, this paper proposes a\ngradient-free attack by using a concept of evolutionary art to generate\nadversarial examples that iteratively evolves a set of overlapping transparent\nshapes. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we attack three\nstate-of-the-art image classification models trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset in\na targeted manner. We conduct a parameter study outlining the impact the number\nand type of shapes have on the proposed attack's performance.

Next, we quantify these risks, enabling drone operators\nto assess privacy risks when planning delivery routes. We then evaluate the\nimpacts of various factors (e.g., drone capacity) on privacy and consider the\ntrade-offs between privacy and delivery wait times.

It consists of a set of\npatches, optimized to generalize across different models, and readily\napplicable to ImageNet data after preprocessing them with affine\ntransformations. This process enables an approximate yet faster robustness\nevaluation, leveraging the transferability of adversarial perturbations. We\nshowcase the usefulness of this dataset by testing the effectiveness of the\ncomputed patches against 127 models.

To date, such an integration is typically\nconducted by human physicians (and panels of experts), which can be subjective\nand semi-quantitative. Recent advances in multi-modal deep learning, however,\nhave opened a door to leverage such a process to a more objective and\nquantitative manner. Unfortunately, the prior arts of using four modalities on\nbrain cancer survival prediction are limited by a \"complete modalities\" setting\n(i.e., with all modalities available). Thus, there are still open questions on\nhow to effectively predict brain cancer survival from the incomplete\nradiological, pathological, genomic, and demographic data (e.g., one or more\nmodalities might not be collected for a patient). For instance, should we use\nboth complete and incomplete data, and more importantly, how to use those data?\nTo answer the preceding questions, we generalize the multi-modal learning on\ncross-department multi-modal data to a missing data setting. Our contribution\nis three-fold: 1) We introduce optimal multi-modal learning with missing data\n(MMD) pipeline with optimized hardware consumption and computational\nefficiency; 2) We extend multi-modal learning on radiological, pathological,\ngenomic, and demographic data into missing data scenarios; 3) a large-scale\npublic dataset (with 962 patients) is collected to systematically evaluate\nglioma tumor survival prediction using four modalities.

At a certain time, to forecast a reasonable future\ntrajectory, each agent needs to pay attention to the interactions with only a\nsmall group of most relevant agents instead of unnecessarily paying attention\nto all the other agents. However, existing attention modeling works ignore that\nhuman attention in driving does not change rapidly, and may introduce\nfluctuating attention across time steps. In this paper, we formulate an\nattention model for multi-agent interactions based on a total variation\ntemporal smoothness prior and propose a trajectory prediction architecture that\nleverages the knowledge of these attended interactions.

However, the estimators,\noften trained with out-of-domain data, can suffer performance degradation as\ndeployed in novel environments. To address the problem, we present a\nSLAM-supported self-training procedure to autonomously improve robot object\npose estimation ability during navigation. Combining the network predictions\nwith robot odometry, we can build a consistent object-level environment map via\npose graph optimization (PGO). Exploiting the state estimates from PGO, we\npseudo-label robot-collected RGB images to fine-tune the pose estimators.\nUnfortunately, it is difficult to model the uncertainty of the estimator\npredictions. The unmodeled uncertainty in the data used for PGO can result in\nlow-quality object pose estimates. An automatic covariance tuning method is\ndeveloped for robust PGO by allowing the measurement uncertainty models to\nchange as part of the optimization process. The formulation permits a\nstraightforward alternating minimization procedure that re-scales covariances\nanalytically and component-wise, enabling more flexible noise modeling for\nlearning-based measurements. We test our method with the deep object pose\nestimator (DOPE) on the YCB video dataset and in real-world robot experiments.\nThe method can achieve significant performance gain in pose estimation, and in\nreturn facilitates the success of object SLAM.",

An additional metric is used to\nevaluate the performance by detecting test utterances with high labelling\nuncertainty. This removes a major limitation that emotion classification\nsystems only consider utterances with majority labels.Furthermore, a\nfrequentist approach is studied to leverage the continuous-valued \"soft\" labels\nobtained by averaging the one-hot labels.

    "abstract": "Human perceptual studies are the gold standard for the evaluation of many\nresearch tasks in machine learning, linguistics, and psychology. However, these\nstudies require significant time and cost to perform. As a result, many\nresearchers use objective measures that can correlate poorly with human\nevaluation. When subjective evaluations are performed, they are often not\nreported with sufficient detail to ensure reproducibility. We propose\nReproducible Subjective Evaluation (ReSEval), an open-source framework for\nquickly deploying crowdsourced subjective evaluations directly from Python.\nReSEval lets researchers launch A/B, ABX, Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and MUltiple\nStimuli with Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA) tests on audio, image, text,\nor video data from a command-line interface or using one line of Python, making\nit as easy to run as objective evaluation. With ReSEval, researchers can\nreproduce each other's subjective evaluations by sharing a configuration file\nand the audio, image, text, or video files.",

Recent advances in representation learning give rise to developments\nin distance-based OOD detection, where testing samples are detected as OOD if\nthey are relatively far away from the centroids or prototypes of\nin-distribution (ID) classes. However, prior methods directly take\noff-the-shelf loss functions that suffice for classifying ID samples, but are\nnot optimally designed for OOD detection. In this paper, we propose CIDER, a\nsimple and effective representation learning framework by exploiting\nhyperspherical embeddings for OOD detection. CIDER jointly optimizes two losses\nto promote strong ID-OOD separability: (1) a dispersion loss that promotes\nlarge angular distances among different class prototypes, and (2) a compactness\nloss that encourages samples to be close to their class prototypes. We show\nthat CIDER is effective under various settings and establishes state-of-the-art\nperformance.

While the concept of cooperation is well\nknown, the development of a robust and efficient cooperative trajectory\nplanning method is still a challenge. One aspect of this challenge is the\nuncertainty surrounding the state of the environment due to limited sensor\naccuracy. This uncertainty can be represented by a Partially Observable Markov\nDecision Process. Our work addresses this problem by extending an existing\ncooperative trajectory planning approach based on Monte Carlo Tree Search for\ncontinuous action spaces. It does so by explicitly modeling uncertainties in\nthe form of a root belief state, from which start states for trees are sampled.\nAfter the trees have been constructed with Monte Carlo Tree Search, their\nresults are aggregated into return distributions using kernel regression. For\nthe final selection, we apply two risk metrics, namely a Lower Confidence Bound\nand a Conditional Value at Risk.

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a local Fourier analysis for multigrid methods with\ncoarsening by a factor of three for the staggered finite-difference method\napplied to the Stokes equations. In [21], local Fourier analysis has been\napplied to a mass-based Braess-Sarazin relaxation, a mass-based $\\sigma$-Uzawa\nrelaxation, and a mass-based distributive relaxation, with standard coarsening\non staggered grids for the Stokes equations. Here, we consider multigrid\nmethods with coarsening by three for these relaxation schemes. We derive\ntheoretically optimal smoothing factors for this coarsening strategy. The\noptimal smoothing factors of coarsening by three are nearly equal to those\nobtained from standard coarsening. Thus, coarsening by three is superior\ncomputationally. Moreover, coarsening by three generates a nested hierarchy of\ngrids, which simplifies and unifies the construction of grid-transfer\noperators.",

    "abstract": "Action recognition from videos, i.e., classifying a video into one of the\npre-defined action types, has been a popular topic in the communities of\nartificial intelligence, multimedia, and signal processing. However, existing\nmethods usually consider an input video as a whole and learn models, e.g.,\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with coarse video-level class labels.\nThese methods can only output an action class for the video, but cannot provide\nfine-grained and explainable cues to answer why the video shows a specific\naction. Therefore, researchers start to focus on a new task, Part-level Action\nParsing (PAP), which aims to not only predict the video-level action but also\nrecognize the frame-level fine-grained actions or interactions of body parts\nfor each person in the video. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine\nframework for this challenging task. In particular, our framework first\npredicts the video-level class of the input video, then localizes the body\nparts and predicts the part-level action. Moreover, to balance the accuracy and\ncomputation in part-level action parsing, we propose to recognize the\npart-level actions by segment-level features. Furthermore, to overcome the\nambiguity of body parts, we propose a pose-guided positional embedding method\nto accurately localize body parts. Through comprehensive experiments on a\nlarge-scale dataset, i.e., Kinetics-TPS, our framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing methods over a 31.10% ROC\nscore.",

    "abstract": "We present a conceptually simple self-supervised method for saliency\ndetection. Our method generates and uses pseudo-ground truth labels for\ntraining. The generated pseudo-GT labels don't require any kind of human\nannotations (e.g., pixel-wise labels or weak labels like scribbles). Recent\nworks show that features extracted from classification tasks provide important\nsaliency cues like structure and semantic information of salient objects in the\nimage. Our method, called 3SD, exploits this idea by adding a branch for a\nself-supervised classification task in parallel with salient object detection,\nto obtain class activation maps (CAM maps). These CAM maps along with the edges\nof the input image are used to generate the pseudo-GT saliency maps to train\nour 3SD network. Specifically, we propose a contrastive learning-based training\non multiple image patches for the classification task. We show the multi-patch\nclassification with contrastive loss improves the quality of the CAM maps\ncompared to naive classification on the entire image. Experiments on six\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that without any labels, our 3SD method\noutperforms all existing weakly supervised and unsupervised methods, and its\nperformance is on par with the fully-supervised methods.

Previous work on\nmulti-agent transfer learning accommodate teams of different sizes, heavily\nrelying on the generalization ability of neural networks for adapting to unseen\ntasks. We believe that the relationship among tasks provides the key\ninformation for policy adaptation.

We demonstrate that the task\nrepresentation can capture the relationship among tasks, and can generalize to\nunseen tasks.

In this paper, we\npropose an energy sharing mechanism to address the above challenges. It takes\ninto account network constraints and fairness among prosumers.

The improved energy sharing\nmechanism with price regulation can guarantee existence and uniqueness of a\nsocially near-optimal market equilibrium. Some advantageous properties are\nproven, such as individual rationality of prosumers, an elegant structure of\nsharing prices, and the tendency towards social optimum with an increasing\nnumber of prosumers.

    "abstract": "Active learning can play an important role in low-resource settings (i.e.,\nwhere annotated data is scarce), by selecting which instances may be more\nworthy to annotate. Most active learning approaches for Machine Translation\nassume the existence of a pool of sentences in a source language, and rely on\nhuman annotators to provide translations or post-edits, which can still be\ncostly. In this paper, we assume a real world human-in-the-loop scenario in\nwhich: (i) the source sentences may not be readily available, but instead\narrive in a stream; (ii) the automatic translations receive feedback in the\nform of a rating, instead of a correct/edited translation, since the\nhuman-in-the-loop might be a user looking for a translation, but not be able to\nprovide one. To tackle the challenge of deciding whether each incoming pair\nsource-translations is worthy to query for human feedback, we resort to a\nnumber of stream-based active learning query strategies. Moreover, since we not\nknow in advance which query strategy will be the most adequate for a certain\nlanguage pair and set of Machine Translation models, we propose to dynamically\ncombine multiple strategies using prediction with expert advice. Our\nexperiments show that using active learning allows to converge to the best\nMachine Translation systems with fewer human interactions.

Current quantitative causal models rely on one or more\nassumptions: (1) the climate drivers persistently generate conflict, (2) the\ncausal mechanisms have a linear relationship with the conflict generation\nparameter, and/or (3) there is sufficient data to inform the prior\ndistribution. Yet, we know conflict drivers often excite a social\ntransformation process which leads to violence (e.g., drought forces\nagricultural producers to join urban militia), but further climate effects do\nnot necessarily contribute to further violence. Therefore, not only is this\nbifurcation relationship highly non-linear, there is also often a lack of data\nto support prior assumptions for high resolution modeling. Here, we aim to\novercome the aforementioned causal modeling challenges by proposing a neural\nforward-intensity Poisson process (NFIPP) model. The NFIPP is designed to\ncapture the potential non-linear causal mechanism in climate induced political\nviolence, whilst being robust to sparse and timing-uncertain data. Our results\nspan 20 recent years and reveal an excitation-based causal link between extreme\nclimate events and political violence across diverse countries.

    "abstract": "The energy dissipation law and the maximum bound principle (MBP) are two\nimportant physical features of the well-known Allen-Cahn equation. While some\ncommonly-used first-order time stepping schemes have turned out to preserve\nunconditionally both energy dissipation law and MBP for the equation,\nrestrictions on the time step size are still needed for existing second-order\nor even higher-order schemes in order to have such simultaneous preservation.\nIn this paper, we develop and analyze novel first- and second-order linear\nnumerical schemes for a class of Allen-Cahn type gradient flows. Our schemes\ncombine the generalized scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach and the\nexponential time integrator with a stabilization term, while the standard\ncentral difference stencil is used for discretization of the spatial\ndifferential operator. We not only prove their unconditional preservation of\nthe energy dissipation law and the MBP in the discrete setting, but also derive\ntheir optimal temporal error estimates under fixed spatial mesh. Numerical\nexperiments are also carried out to demonstrate the properties and performance\nof the proposed schemes.",

    "title": "Metric Entropy Duality and the Sample Complexity of Outcome  Indistinguishability",
    "abstract": "We give the first sample complexity characterizations for outcome\nindistinguishability, a theoretical framework of machine learning recently\nintroduced by Dwork, Kim, Reingold, Rothblum, and Yona (STOC 2021). In outcome\nindistinguishability, the goal of the learner is to output a predictor that\ncannot be distinguished from the target predictor by a class $D$ of\ndistinguishers examining the outcomes generated according to the predictors'\npredictions.\nIn the distribution-specific and realizable setting where the learner is\ngiven the data distribution together with a predictor class $P$ containing the\ntarget predictor, we show that the sample complexity of outcome\nindistinguishability is characterized by the metric entropy of $P$ w.r.t. the\ndual Minkowski norm defined by $D$, and equivalently by the metric entropy of\n$D$ w.r.t. the dual Minkowski norm defined by $P$. This equivalence makes an\nintriguing connection to the long-standing metric entropy duality conjecture in\nconvex geometry. Our sample complexity characterization implies a variant of\nmetric entropy duality, which we show is nearly tight. In the distribution-free\nsetting, we focus on the case considered by Dwork et al. where $P$ contains all\npossible predictors, hence the sample complexity only depends on $D$. In this\nsetting, we show that the sample complexity of outcome indistinguishability is\ncharacterized by the fat-shattering dimension of $D$.\nWe also show a strong sample complexity separation between realizable and\nagnostic outcome indistinguishability in both the distribution-free and the\ndistribution-specific settings. This is in contrast to distribution-free (resp.\ndistribution-specific) PAC learning where the sample complexity in both the\nrealizable and the agnostic settings can be characterized by the VC dimension\n(resp. metric entropy).",

    "title": "Fast Road Segmentation via Uncertainty-aware Symmetric Network",
    "abstract": "The high performance of RGB-D based road segmentation methods contrasts with\ntheir rare application in commercial autonomous driving, which is owing to two\nreasons: 1) the prior methods cannot achieve high inference speed and high\naccuracy in both ways; 2) the different properties of RGB and depth data are\nnot well-exploited, limiting the reliability of predicted road. In this paper,\nbased on the evidence theory, an uncertainty-aware symmetric network (USNet) is\nproposed to achieve a trade-off between speed and accuracy by fully fusing RGB\nand depth data. Firstly, cross-modal feature fusion operations, which are\nindispensable in the prior RGB-D based methods, are abandoned. We instead\nseparately adopt two light-weight subnetworks to learn road representations\nfrom RGB and depth inputs. The light-weight structure guarantees the real-time\ninference of our method. Moreover, a multiscale evidence collection (MEC)\nmodule is designed to collect evidence in multiple scales for each modality,\nwhich provides sufficient evidence for pixel class determination. Finally, in\nuncertainty-aware fusion (UAF) module, the uncertainty of each modality is\nperceived to guide the fusion of the two subnetworks. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy with real-time\ninference speed of 43+ FPS.

    "abstract": "The performance of monocular depth estimation generally depends on the amount\nof parameters and computational cost. It leads to a large accuracy contrast\nbetween light-weight networks and heavy-weight networks, which limits their\napplication in the real world. In this paper, we model the majority of accuracy\ncontrast between them as the difference of depth distribution, which we call\n\"Distribution drift\". To this end, a distribution alignment network (DANet) is\nproposed. We firstly design a pyramid scene transformer (PST) module to capture\ninter-region interaction in multiple scales. By perceiving the difference of\ndepth features between every two regions, DANet tends to predict a reasonable\nscene structure, which fits the shape of distribution to ground truth. Then, we\npropose a local-global optimization (LGO) scheme to realize the supervision of\nglobal range of scene depth. Thanks to the alignment of depth distribution\nshape and scene depth range, DANet sharply alleviates the distribution drift,\nand achieves a comparable performance with prior heavy-weight methods, but uses\nonly 1% floating-point operations per second (FLOPs) of them. The experiments\non two datasets, namely the widely used NYUDv2 dataset and the more challenging\niBims-1 dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

    "abstract": "Autonomous navigation of ground robots has been widely used in indoor\nstructured 2D environments, but there are still many challenges in outdoor 3D\nunstructured environments, especially in rough, uneven terrains. This paper\nproposed a plane-fitting based uneven terrain navigation framework (PUTN) to\nsolve this problem. The implementation of PUTN is divided into three steps.\nFirst, based on Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), an improved sample-based\nalgorithm called Plane Fitting RRT* (PF-RRT*) is proposed to obtain a sparse\ntrajectory. Each sampling point corresponds to a custom traversability index\nand a fitted plane on the point cloud. These planes are connected in series to\nform a traversable strip. Second, Gaussian Process Regression is used to\ngenerate traversability of the dense trajectory interpolated from the sparse\ntrajectory, and the sampling tree is used as the training set. Finally, local\nplanning is performed using nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). By\nadding the traversability index and uncertainty to the cost function, and\nadding obstacles generated by the real-time point cloud to the constraint\nfunction, a safe motion planning algorithm with smooth speed and strong\nrobustness is available.

Under the co-pilot\nassignment strategy, we derive the minimum-mean-square error (MMSE) channel\nstate information (CSI) estimation for unicast and multicast users. Given the\nacquired CSI, the closed-form expressions for downlink achievable rates with\nmaximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF) and MMSE beamforming are\nderived. Based on these expressions, we propose an efficient power allocation\nscheme by solving a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) between\nmaximizing the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) of multicast users and\nmaximizing the average SE of unicast users with non-dominated sorting genetic\nalgorithm II (NSGA-II).

    "abstract": "Current stereo matching techniques are challenged by restricted searching\nspace, occluded regions, and sheer size. While single image depth estimation is\nspared from these challenges and can achieve satisfactory results with the\nextracted monocular cues, the lack of stereoscopic relationship renders the\nmonocular prediction less reliable on its own, especially in highly dynamic or\ncluttered environments. To address these issues in both scenarios, we present\nan optic-chiasm-inspired self-supervised binocular depth estimation method,\nwherein vision transformer (ViT) with a gated positional cross-attention (GPCA)\nlayer is designed to enable feature-sensitive pattern retrieval between views\nwhile retaining the extensive context information aggregated through\nself-attentions.

    "abstract": "Video-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (VUDA) methods improve the\nrobustness of video models, enabling them to be applied to action recognition\ntasks across different environments. However, these methods require constant\naccess to source data during the adaptation process. Yet in many real-world\napplications, subjects and scenes in the source video domain should be\nirrelevant to those in the target video domain. With the increasing emphasis on\ndata privacy, such methods that require source data access would raise serious\nprivacy issues. Therefore, to cope with such concern, a more practical domain\nadaptation scenario is formulated as the Source-Free Video-based Domain\nAdaptation (SFVDA). Though there are a few methods for Source-Free Domain\nAdaptation (SFDA) on image data, these methods yield degenerating performance\nin SFVDA due to the multi-modality nature of videos, with the existence of\nadditional temporal features. In this paper, we propose a novel Attentive\nTemporal Consistent Network (ATCoN) to address SFVDA by learning temporal\nconsistency, guaranteed by two novel consistency objectives, namely feature\nconsistency and source prediction consistency, performed across local temporal\nfeatures.

Now, semi-supervised learning has achieved\ngreat success in training with few annotations.

In this paper we propose an active self-semi-supervised\ntraining framework that bootstraps semi-supervised models with good prior\npseudo-labels, where the priors are obtained by label propagation over\nself-supervised features. Because the accuracy of the prior is not only\naffected by the quality of features, but also by the selection of the labeled\nsamples.

Consequently, our framework can greatly improve the\nperformance of models with few annotations and greatly reduce the training\ntime. Experiments on three semi-supervised learning benchmarks demonstrate\neffectiveness.

LUV uses\ntransparent, ultraviolet-fluorescent paint with programmable ultraviolet LEDs\nto collect paired images of a scene in standard lighting and UV lighting to\nautonomously extract segmentation masks and keypoints via color segmentation.\nWe apply LUV to a suite of diverse robot perception tasks to evaluate its\nlabeling quality, flexibility, and data collection rate. Results suggest that\nLUV is 180-2500 times faster than a human labeler across the tasks. We show\nthat LUV provides labels consistent with human annotations on unpainted test\nimages.

    "abstract": "Vision transformer (ViT) has achieved competitive accuracy on a variety of\ncomputer vision applications, but its computational cost impedes the deployment\non resource-limited mobile devices.\nWe explore the sparsity in ViT and observe that informative patches and heads\nare sufficient for accurate image recognition.\nIn this paper, we propose a cascade pruning framework named CP-ViT by\npredicting sparsity in ViT models progressively and dynamically to reduce\ncomputational redundancy while minimizing the accuracy loss. Specifically, we\ndefine the cumulative score to reserve the informative patches and heads across\nthe ViT model for better accuracy. We also propose the dynamic pruning ratio\nadjustment technique based on layer-aware attention range. CP-ViT has great\ngeneral applicability for practical deployment, which can be applied to a wide\nrange of ViT models and can achieve superior accuracy with or without\nfine-tuning.\nExtensive experiments on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with various\npre-trained models have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of\nCP-ViT. By progressively pruning 50\\% patches, our CP-ViT method reduces over\n40\\% FLOPs while maintaining accuracy loss within 1\\%.",

    "abstract": "In stream-based active learning, the learning procedure typically has access\nto a stream of unlabeled data instances and must decide for each instance\nwhether to label it and use it for training or to discard it. There are\nnumerous active learning strategies which try to minimize the number of labeled\nsamples required for training in this setting by identifying and retaining the\nmost informative data samples. Most of these schemes are rule-based and rely on\nthe notion of uncertainty, which captures how small the distance of a data\nsample is from the classifier's decision boundary. Recently, there have been\nsome attempts to learn optimal selection strategies directly from the data, but\nmany of them are still lacking generality for several reasons: 1) They focus on\nspecific classification setups, 2) They rely on rule-based metrics, 3) They\nrequire offline pre-training of the active learner on related tasks. In this\nwork we address the above limitations and present an online stream-based meta\nactive learning method which learns on the fly an informativeness measure\ndirectly from the data, and is applicable to a general class of classification\nproblems without any need for pretraining of the active learner on related\ntasks. The method is based on reinforcement learning and combines episodic\npolicy search and a contextual bandits approach which are used to train the\nactive learner in conjunction with training of the model. We demonstrate on\nseveral real datasets that this method learns to select training samples more\nefficiently than existing state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Power distribution systems are becoming much more active with increased\npenetration of distributed energy resources (DERs). Because of the intermittent\noutputs from DERs, the stability of distribution systems under large\ndisturbances and time-varying conditions is becoming a key concern for\npractical operations. However, the transmission lines in distribution systems\nare called \"lossy\" in the sense that the resistances are comparable to\nreactances., There is a lack of a good Lyapunov function to be used for systems\nwith lossy lines, making the transient stability a much harder problem that\nremains open even for simplified models.\nThis paper proposes a novel equilibrium-independent transient stability\nanalysis of distribution systems with lossy lines. We certify network-level\nstability by breaking the network into subsystems, where a tunable model for\nlossy transmission lines is designed to explicitly tradeoff between the control\neffort and the stability region. By looking at the equilibrium-independent\npassivity of each subsystem, the network stability is certified through a\ndiagonal stability property of the interconnection matrix. This allows the\nanalysis scale to large networked systems with time-varying equilibriums. The\nproposed method gracefully extrapolates between lossless and lossy systems, and\nprovides a simple yet effective approach to optimize control efforts with\nguaranteed stability regions.

However, fine-tuning is usually computationally expensive due to\nthe ever-growing size of pretrained models. More importantly, it may cause\nover-fitting on source domain and compromise their generalization ability as\nshown in recent works. Generally, pretrained models possess some level of\ngeneralization ability and can achieve decent performance regarding specific\ndomains and samples. However, the generalization performance of pretrained\nmodels could vary significantly over different test domains even samples, which\nraises challenges for us to best leverage pretrained models in DG tasks.

It first trains a linear label space adapter\nupon fixed pretrained models, which transforms the outputs of the pretrained\nmodel to the label space of the target domain.

Among all the threat models, no-box attacks\nare the most practical but extremely challenging since they neither rely on any\nknowledge of the target model or similar substitute model, nor access the\ndataset for training a new substitute model. Although a recent method has\nattempted such an attack in a loose sense, its performance is not good enough\nand computational overhead of training is expensive. In this paper, we move a\nstep forward and show the existence of a \\textbf{training-free} adversarial\nperturbation under the no-box threat model, which can be successfully used to\nattack different DNNs in real-time. Motivated by our observation that\nhigh-frequency component (HFC) domains in low-level features and plays a\ncrucial role in classification, we attack an image mainly by manipulating its\nfrequency components. Specifically, the perturbation is manipulated by\nsuppression of the original HFC and adding of noisy HFC. We empirically and\nexperimentally analyze the requirements of effective noisy HFC and show that it\nshould be regionally homogeneous, repeating and dense. Extensive experiments on\nthe ImageNet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed no-box\nmethod.

It exploits the ability of deep learning techniques to\nreliably detect objects regardless of viewing conditions. Previous works have\nalso shown that abstracting the geometry of a scene of objects by an ellipsoid\ncloud allows to compute the camera pose accurately enough for various\napplication needs. Though promising, these approaches use the ellipses fitted\nto the detection bounding boxes as an approximation of the imaged objects.

Experiments prove that the\naccuracy of the computed pose significantly increases thanks to our method.\nThis is achieved with very little effort in terms of training data acquisition\n- a few hundred calibrated images of which only three need manual object\nannotation.

    "abstract": "The Lip-field approach is a new way to regularize softening material models.\nIt has already been tested in 1D quasistatic and 2D quasistatic: this paper\nextends it to 1D dynamics, on the challenging problem of dynamic fragmentation.\nThe Lip-field approach formulates the mechanical problem to be solved as an\noptimization problem, where the incremental potential to be minimized is the\nnon-regularized one. Spurious localization is prevented by imposing a Lipschitz\nconstraint on the damage field. The displacement and damage field at each time\nstep are obtained by a staggered algorithm, that is the displacement field is\ncomputed for a fixed damage field, then the damage field is computed for a\nfixed displacement field. Indeed, these two problems are convex, which is not\nthe case of the global problem where the displacement and damage fields are\nsought at the same time. The incremental potential is obtained by equivalence\nwith a cohesive zone model, which makes material parameters calibration simple.\nA non-regularized local damage equivalent to a cohesive zone model is also\nproposed. It is used as a reference for the Lip-field approach, without the\nneed to implement displacement jumps.\nThese approaches are applied to the brittle fragmentation of a 1D bar with\nrandomly perturbed material properties to accelerate spatial convergence. Both\nexplicit and implicit dynamic implementations are compared. Favorable\ncomparison to several analytical, numerical and experimental references serves\nto validate the modeling approach.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of face recognition models\nagainst physical adversarial patches, which raises security concerns about the\ndeployed face recognition systems. However, it is still challenging to ensure\nthe reproducibility for most attack algorithms under complex physical\nconditions, which leads to the lack of a systematic evaluation of the existing\nmethods. It is therefore imperative to develop a framework that can enable a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the vulnerability of face recognition in the\nphysical world. To this end, we propose to simulate the complex transformations\nof faces in the physical world via 3D-face modeling, which serves as a digital\ncounterpart of physical faces. The generic framework allows us to control\ndifferent face variations and physical conditions to conduct reproducible\nevaluations comprehensively. With this digital simulator, we further propose a\nFace3DAdv method considering the 3D face transformations and realistic physical\nvariations. Extensive experiments validate that Face3DAdv can significantly\nimprove the effectiveness of diverse physically realizable adversarial patches\nin both simulated and physical environments, against various white-box and\nblack-box face recognition models.",

    "abstract": "Methods for upwinding the potential vorticity in a finite element\ndiscretisation of the rotating shallow water equations are studied. These\ninclude the well-known anticipated potential vorticity method (APVM),\nstreamwise upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method, and a recent approach where\nthe trial functions are evaluated downstream within the reference element. In\nall cases the upwinding scheme conserves both potential vorticity and energy,\nsince the antisymmetric structure of the equations is preserved. The APVM leads\nto a symmetric definite correction to the potential enstrophy that is\ndissipative and inconsistent, resulting in a turbulent state where the\npotential enstrophy is more strongly damped than for the other schemes. While\nthe SUPG scheme is widely known to be consistent, since it modifies the test\nfunctions only, the downwinded trial function formulation results in the\nadvection of downwind corrections. Results of the SUPG and downwinded trial\nfunction schemes are very similar in terms of both potential enstrophy\nconservation and turbulent spectra. The main difference between these schemes\nis in the energy conservation and residual errors. If just two nonlinear\niterations are applied then the energy conservation errors are greatly improved\nfor the downwinded trial function formulation, reflecting a smaller residual\nerror than for the SUPG scheme.\nWe also present a formulation by which potential enstrophy is exactly\nconserved in time. The application of the APVM with exact temporal conservation\nof potential enstrophy yields conservation errors that are significantly\nsmaller than those of the SUPG or downwinded trial function formulations using\na potential enstrophy dissipating time discretisation. Exact conservation of\nthe potential enstrophy in time allows for stable simulation in the absence of\ndissipation, despite the uncontrolled aliasing of grid scale turbulence.",

    "abstract": "People always desire an embodied agent that can perform a task by\nunderstanding language instruction. Moreover, they also want to monitor and\nexpect agents to understand commands the way they expected. But, how to build\nsuch an embodied agent is still unclear. Recently, people can explore this\nproblem with the Vision-and-Language Interaction benchmark ALFRED, which\nrequires an agent to perform complicated daily household tasks following\nnatural language instructions in unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose LEBP\n-- Language Expectation and Binding Policy Module to tackle the ALFRED. The\nLEBP contains a two-stream process: 1) It first conducts a language expectation\nmodule to generate an expectation describing how to perform tasks by\nunderstanding the language instruction. The expectation consists of a sequence\nof sub-steps for the task (e.g., Pick an apple). The expectation allows people\nto access and check the understanding results of instructions before the agent\ntakes actual actions, in case the task might go wrong. 2) Then, it uses the\nbinding policy module to bind sub-steps in expectation to actual actions to\nspecific scenarios. Actual actions include navigation and object manipulation.\nExperimental results suggest our approach achieves comparable performance to\ncurrently published SOTA methods and can avoid large decay from seen scenarios\nto unseen scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Learning text classifiers based on pre-trained language models has become the\nstandard practice in natural language processing applications. Unfortunately,\ntraining large neural language models, such as transformers, from scratch is\nvery costly and requires a vast amount of training data, which might not be\navailable in the application domain of interest. Moreover, in many real-world\nscenarios, classes are uncovered as more data is seen, calling for\nclass-incremental modelling approaches. In this work we devise a method to\nperform text classification using pre-trained models on a sequence of\nclassification tasks provided in sequence. We formalize the problem as a\ncontinual learning problem where the algorithm learns new tasks without\nperformance degradation on the previous ones and without re-training the model\nfrom scratch. We empirically demonstrate that our method requires significantly\nless model parameters compared to other state of the art methods and that it is\nsignificantly faster at inference time. The tight control on the number of\nmodel parameters, and so the memory, is not only improving efficiency. It is\nmaking possible the usage of the algorithm in real-world applications where\ndeploying a solution with a constantly increasing memory consumption is just\nunrealistic. While our method suffers little forgetting, it retains a\npredictive performance on-par with state of the art but less memory efficient\nmethods.",

    "title": "Reliable IoT Firmware Updates: A Large-scale Mesh Network Performance  Investigation",
    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) networks require regular firmware updates to ensure\nenhanced security and stability. As we move towards methodologies of codifying\nsecurity and policy decisions and exchanging them over IoT large-scale\ndeployments (security-as-a-code), these demands should be considered a routine\noperation. However, rolling out firmware updates to large-scale networks\npresents a crucial challenge for constrained wireless environments with large\nnumbers of IoT devices. This paper initially investigates how the current\nstate-of-the-art protocols operate in such adverse conditions by measuring\nvarious Quality-of-Service (QoS) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the\nshared wireless medium. We later discuss how Concurrent Transmissions (CT) can\nextend the scalability of IoT protocols and ensure reliable firmware roll-outs\nover large geographical areas. Measuring KPIs such as the mesh join time, the\nthroughput, and the number of nodes forming a network, we provide great insight\ninto how an IoT environment will behave under a large-scale firmware roll-out.\nFinally, we conducted our performance investigation over the UMBRELLA platform,\na real-world IoT testbed deployed in Bristol, UK. This ensures our findings\nrepresent a realistic IoT scenario and meet the strict QoS requirements of\ntoday's IoT applications.",

    "title": "The Cross-evaluation of Machine Learning-based Network Intrusion  Detection Systems",
    "abstract": "Enhancing Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) with supervised Machine\nLearning (ML) is tough. ML-NIDS must be trained and evaluated, operations\nrequiring data where benign and malicious samples are clearly labelled. Such\nlabels demand costly expert knowledge, resulting in a lack of real deployments,\nas well as on papers always relying on the same outdated data. The situation\nimproved recently, as some efforts disclosed their labelled datasets. However,\nmost past works used such datasets just as a 'yet another' testbed, overlooking\nthe added potential provided by such availability.\nIn contrast, we promote using such existing labelled data to cross-evaluate\nML-NIDS. Such approach received only limited attention and, due to its\ncomplexity, requires a dedicated treatment. We hence propose the first\ncross-evaluation model. Our model highlights the broader range of realistic\nuse-cases that can be assessed via cross-evaluations, allowing the discovery of\nstill unknown qualities of state-of-the-art ML-NIDS. For instance, their\ndetection surface can be extended--at no additional labelling cost. However,\nconducting such cross-evaluations is challenging. Hence, we propose the first\nframework, XeNIDS, for reliable cross-evaluations based on Network Flows. By\nusing XeNIDS on six well-known datasets, we demonstrate the concealed\npotential, but also the risks, of cross-evaluations of ML-NIDS.",

In the computer vision area,\nmany researches focus on co-segmentation (CoS), co-saliency detection (CoSD)\nand video salient object detection (VSOD) to discover the co-occurrent objects.\nHowever, previous approaches design different networks on these similar tasks\nseparately, and they are difficult to apply to each other, which lowers the\nupper bound of the transferability of deep learning frameworks. Besides, they\nfail to take full advantage of the cues among inter- and intra-feature within a\ngroup of images. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework to tackle\nthese issues, term as UFO (Unified Framework for Co-Object Segmentation).\nSpecifically, we first introduce a transformer block, which views the image\nfeature as a patch token and then captures their long-range dependencies\nthrough the self-attention mechanism. This can help the network to excavate the\npatch structured similarities among the relevant objects. Furthermore, we\npropose an intra-MLP learning module to produce self-mask to enhance the\nnetwork to avoid partial activation.

Although\nvarious deep learning (DL) models for IR tasks have been investigated in the\nAEC domain, it is still unclear how domain corpora and domain-specific\npretrained DL models can improve performance in various IR tasks. To this end,\nthis work systematically explores the impacts of domain corpora and various\ntransfer learning techniques on the performance of DL models for IR tasks and\nproposes a pretrained domain-specific language model for the AEC domain.

Finally, several widely used DL models for IR tasks are\nfurther trained and tested based on various configurations and pretrained\nmodels. The result shows that domain corpora have opposite effects on\ntraditional word embedding models for text classification and named entity\nrecognition tasks but can further improve the performance of BERT-based models\nin all tasks. Meanwhile, BERT-based models dramatically outperform traditional\nmethods in all IR tasks, with maximum improvements of 5.4% and 10.1% in the F1\nscore, respectively. This research contributes to the body of knowledge in two\nways: 1) demonstrating the advantages of domain corpora and pretrained DL\nmodels and 2) opening the first domain-specific dataset and pretrained language\nmodel for the AEC domain, to the best of our knowledge. Thus, this work sheds\nlight on the adoption and application of pretrained models in the AEC domain.",

Research into the applications of aircraft\ndata is essential in improving safety, reducing operational costs, and\ndeveloping the next frontier of aerial technology. Having an outlier detection\nsystem that can accurately identify anomalous behaviour in aircraft is crucial\nfor these reasons. This paper proposes a system incorporating a Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) Deep Learning Autoencoder based method with a novel dynamic\nthresholding algorithm and weighted loss function for anomaly detection of a\nUAV dataset, in order to contribute to the ongoing efforts that leverage\ninnovations in machine learning and data analysis within the aviation industry.\nThe dynamic thresholding and weighted loss functions showed promising\nimprovements to the standard static thresholding method, both in\naccuracy-related performance metrics and in speed of true fault detection.",

    "abstract": "The demand to process vast amounts of data generated from state-of-the-art\nhigh resolution cameras has motivated novel energy-efficient on-device AI\nsolutions. Visual data in such cameras are usually captured in the form of\nanalog voltages by a sensor pixel array, and then converted to the digital\ndomain for subsequent AI processing using analog-to-digital converters (ADC).\nRecent research has tried to take advantage of massively parallel low-power\nanalog/digital computing in the form of near- and in-sensor processing, in\nwhich the AI computation is performed partly in the periphery of the pixel\narray and partly in a separate on-board CPU/accelerator. Unfortunately,\nhigh-resolution input images still need to be streamed between the camera and\nthe AI processing unit, frame by frame, causing energy, bandwidth, and security\nbottlenecks. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel\nProcessing-in-Pixel-in-memory (P2M) paradigm, that customizes the pixel array\nby adding support for analog multi-channel, multi-bit convolution and ReLU\n(Rectified Linear Units). Our solution includes a holistic algorithm-circuit\nco-design approach and the resulting P2M paradigm can be used as a drop-in\nreplacement for embedding memory-intensive first few layers of convolutional\nneural network (CNN) models within foundry-manufacturable CMOS image sensor\nplatforms. Our experimental results indicate that P2M reduces data transfer\nbandwidth from sensors and analog to digital conversions by ~21x, and the\nenergy-delay product (EDP) incurred in processing a MobileNetV2 model on a\nTinyML use case for visual wake words dataset (VWW) by up to ~11x compared to\nstandard near-processing or in-sensor implementations, without any significant\ndrop in test accuracy.",

Prior efforts to\nparallelize GRU have largely focused on conventional parallelization strategies\nsuch as data-parallel and model-parallel training algorithms. However, when the\ngiven sequences are very long, existing approaches are still inevitably\nperformance limited in terms of training time. In this paper, we present a\nnovel parallel training scheme (called parallel-in-time) for GRU based on a\nmultigrid reduction in time (MGRIT) solver. MGRIT partitions a sequence into\nmultiple shorter sub-sequences and trains the sub-sequences on different\nprocessors in parallel. The key to achieving speedup is a hierarchical\ncorrection of the hidden state to accelerate end-to-end communication in both\nthe forward and backward propagation phases of gradient descent. Experimental\nresults on the HMDB51 dataset, where each video is an image sequence,\ndemonstrate that the new parallel training scheme achieves up to 6.5$\\times$\nspeedup over a serial approach.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a deep learning framework to design distributed\ncompression strategies in which distributed agents need to compress\nhigh-dimensional observations of a source, then send the compressed bits via\nbandwidth limited links to a fusion center for source reconstruction. Further,\nwe require the compression strategy to be progressive so that it can adapt to\nthe varying link bandwidths between the agents and the fusion center. Moreover,\nto ensure scalability, we investigate strategies that depend only on the local\nchannel state information (CSI) at each agent. Toward this end, we use a\ndata-driven approach in which the progressive linear combination and uniform\nquantization strategy at each agent are trained as a function of its local CSI.\nTo deal with the challenges of modeling the quantization operations (which\nalways produce zero gradients in the training of neural networks), we propose a\nnovel approach of exploiting the statistics of the batch training data to set\nthe dynamic ranges of the uniform quantizers. Numerically, we show that the\nproposed distributed estimation strategy designed with only local CSI can\nsignificantly reduce the signaling overhead and can achieve a lower\nmean-squared error distortion for source reconstruction than state-of-the-art\ndesigns that require global CSI at comparable overall communication cost.",

Car following is a prime function in autonomous\ndriving. Car following based on reinforcement learning has received attention\nin recent years with the goal of learning and achieving performance levels\ncomparable to humans. However, most existing RL methods model car following as\na unilateral problem, sensing only the vehicle ahead. Recent literature,\nhowever, Wang and Horn [16] has shown that bilateral car following that\nconsiders the vehicle ahead and the vehicle behind exhibits better system\nstability. In this paper we hypothesize that this bilateral car following can\nbe learned using RL, while learning other goals such as efficiency\nmaximisation, jerk minimization, and safety rewards leading to a learned model\nthat outperforms human driving.\nWe propose and introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for\ncar following control by integrating bilateral information into both state and\nreward function based on the bilateral control model (BCM) for car following\ncontrol. Furthermore, we use a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning\nframework to generate the corresponding control action for each agent.

Recently, soft robotic hands, a new trend has emerged, aiming to make\nthe design adequately complex and affordable while requiring much less effort\nto control. In the first part of this article, we will lay out several\nprominent designs in this direction and their applications in real world\nscenarios. Having a suitable hardware simplified the complexity of software\ndesigning. However, manually controlling the hand for one task requires a\nsignificantly large amount of time and effort and doing it repeatedly is\nunsurprisingly tedious. Therefore, in the second part, we will show some recent\ntechniques for soft hand autonomous control. We start by briefly discussing the\nanalytic methods that mainly exploit the hand dynamic information. Then,\ndata-driven approaches will be our main focus. It is the trending research\ntopic for soft hand grasping in recent years as it has shown a high performance\nwhen dealing with a large number of various objects.",

We believe, they can help gaining an overview over similar-minded\ngroups and could support the prevention of fake-news distribution. The first\nmethod uses a new approach to create a network based on retweet relationships\nbetween users and the most retweeted users, the so-called influencers. The\nsecond method extracts hashtags from users posts to create a \"user feature\nvector\" which is then clustered, using a consensus matrix based on previous\nwork, to identify groups using the same language. With both approaches it was\npossible to identify clusters that seem to fit groups of different public\nopinions in Germany.

Second, SHAP, a\nframework for Explainable Artificial Intelligence, is employed to capture the\nmost important features in explaining clearance patterns both at the national\nand state levels.\nResults: At the national level, XGBoost demonstrates to achieve the best\nperformance overall.

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of future human positions is an essential task for modern\nvideo-surveillance systems. Current state-of-the-art models usually rely on a\n\"history\" of past tracked locations (e.g., 3 to 5 seconds) to predict a\nplausible sequence of future locations (e.g., up to the next 5 seconds). We\nfeel that this common schema neglects critical traits of realistic\napplications: as the collection of input trajectories involves machine\nperception (i.e., detection and tracking), incorrect detection and\nfragmentation errors may accumulate in crowded scenes, leading to tracking\ndrifts. On this account, the model would be fed with corrupted and noisy input\ndata, thus fatally affecting its prediction performance.\nIn this regard, we focus on delivering accurate predictions when only few\ninput observations are used, thus potentially lowering the risks associated\nwith automatic perception. To this end, we conceive a novel distillation\nstrategy that allows a knowledge transfer from a teacher network to a student\none, the latter fed with fewer observations (just two ones). We show that a\nproperly defined teacher supervision allows a student network to perform\ncomparably to state-of-the-art approaches that demand more observations.\nBesides, extensive experiments on common trajectory forecasting datasets\nhighlight that our student network better generalizes to unseen scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Black-box policy optimization is a class of reinforcement learning algorithms\nthat explores and updates the policies at the parameter level. This class of\nalgorithms is widely applied in robotics with movement primitives or\nnon-differentiable policies. Furthermore, these approaches are particularly\nrelevant where exploration at the action level could cause actuator damage or\nother safety issues. However, Black-box optimization does not scale well with\nthe increasing dimensionality of the policy, leading to high demand for\nsamples, which are expensive to obtain in real-world systems. In many practical\napplications, policy parameters do not contribute equally to the return.\nIdentifying the most relevant parameters allows to narrow down the exploration\nand speed up the learning. Furthermore, updating only the effective parameters\nrequires fewer samples, improving the scalability of the method. We present a\nnovel method to prioritize the exploration of effective parameters and cope\nwith full covariance matrix updates. Our algorithm learns faster than recent\napproaches and requires fewer samples to achieve state-of-the-art results. To\nselect the effective parameters, we consider both the Pearson correlation\ncoefficient and the Mutual Information.

Existing deep learning approaches for\n6D pose estimation typically rely on the assumption of availability of 3D\nobject models and 6D pose annotations. However, precise annotation of 6D poses\nin real data is intricate, time-consuming and not scalable, while synthetic\ndata scales well but lacks realism. To avoid these problems, we present a\nweakly-supervised reconstruction-based pipeline, named NeRF-Pose, which needs\nonly 2D object segmentation and known relative camera poses during training.\nFollowing the first-reconstruct-then-regress idea, we first reconstruct the\nobjects from multiple views in the form of an implicit neural representation.\nThen, we train a pose regression network to predict pixel-wise 2D-3D\ncorrespondences between images and the reconstructed model.

In the meanwhile, it greatly outperforms the competitors\nin the recent Open Catalyst Challenge, which is a competition track on NeurIPS\n2021 workshop, and aims to model the catalyst-adsorbate reaction system with\nadvanced AI models.

    "abstract": "The coordination of prosumer-owned, behind-the-meter distributed energy\nresources (DER) can be achieved using a multiperiod, distributed optimal power\nflow (DOPF), which satisfies network constraints and preserves the privacy of\nprosumers. To solve the problem in a distributed fashion, it is decomposed and\nsolved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which may\nrequire many iterations between prosumers and the central entity (i.e., an\naggregator). Furthermore, the computational burden is shared among the agents\nwith different processing capacities. Therefore, computational constraints and\ncommunication requirements may make the DOPF infeasible or impractical. In this\npaper, part of the DOPF (some of the prosumer subproblems) is executed on a\nRaspberry Pi-based hardware prototype, which emulates a low processing power,\nedge computing device. Four important aspects are analyzed using test cases of\ndifferent complexities. The first is the computation cost of executing the\nsubproblems in the edge computing device. The second is the algorithm operation\non congested electrical networks, which impacts the convergence speed of DOPF\nsolutions. Third, the precision of the computed solution, including the\ntrade-off between solution quality and the number of iterations, is examined.\nFourth, the communication requirements for implementation across different\ncommunication networks are investigated.

In this work, we\npropose CMX, a vision-transformer-based cross-modal fusion framework for RGB-X\nsemantic segmentation. To generalize to different sensing modalities\nencompassing various uncertainties, we consider that comprehensive cross-modal\ninteractions should be provided. CMX is built with two streams to extract\nfeatures from RGB images and the complementary modality (X-modality).

In practice, inverter reactive power control\nis increasingly required by grid connection codes, which often unfairly curtail\nPV generation of prosumers towards the end of low-voltage feeders. Similarly,\noptimization-based DER coordination methods that aim solely for\ntechnically-efficient DER coordination do not consider the distribution of PV\ncurtailment across customers. To address these concerns, we develop a tractable\nmulti-objective DOPF method for optimal DER coordination that (i) curtails PV\ngeneration fairly across prosumers, and (ii) incorporates a standard\npiecewise-linear volt-var control reactive power control function without using\ninteger variables. Three equity principles representing different\ninterpretations of fairness are implemented in our coordination method; namely,\negalitarian, proportional and uniform dynamic PV curtailment redistribution.\nThe performance of our approach is demonstrated on low-voltage distribution\nfeeders of different sizes (5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 prosumers) using two network\ntopologies: line topology without lateral spurs and tree topology with lateral\nspurs. Each network considers three levels of PV penetration, giving 30 test\nsystems in total. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nDOPF method for fair DER coordination: PV curtailment is equitably distributed\namong prosumers with a computational burden on par with conventional DOPF\napproaches. Moreover, different fairness methods result in different patterns\nof curtailment, which a regulator may choose between.",

Due to the combinatorial nature of this\nsetting, we need to go beyond the standard techniques in robust machine\nlearning to address this problem. We consider a binary classification scenario\nwhere $d$ noisy data samples of the true label are provided to us after\nadversarial perturbations. We introduce a classification method which employs a\nnonlinear component called truncation, and show in an asymptotic scenario, as\nlong as the adversary is restricted to perturb no more than $\\sqrt{d}$ data\nsamples, we can almost achieve the optimal classification error in the absence\nof the adversary, i.e. we can completely neutralize adversary's effect.\nSurprisingly, we observe a phase transition in the sense that using a converse\nargument, we show that if the adversary can perturb more than $\\sqrt{d}$\ncoordinates, no classifier can do better than a random guess.",

We examine the loss formulation and empirically show that\nour method significantly reduces the number of parameters transferred to and\noptimized by the client devices, while performing on par with the standard full\nsoftmax method.

To this end, we (i) exhaustively evaluate common meta-learning\ntechniques on these tasks, and (ii) quantitatively analyze the effect of\nvarious deep learning techniques commonly used in recent meta-learning\nalgorithms in order to strengthen the generalization capability: data\naugmentation, domain randomization, task augmentation and meta-regularization.\nFinally, we (iii) provide some insights and practical recommendations for\ntraining meta-learning algorithms on vision regression tasks. \\emph{Second}, we\npropose the addition of functional contrastive learning (FCL) over the task\nrepresentations in Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs) and train in an\nend-to-end fashion. The experimental results show that the results of prior\nwork are misleading as a consequence of a poor choice of the loss function as\nwell as too small meta-training sets. Specifically, we find that CNPs\noutperform MAML on most tasks without fine-tuning. Furthermore, we observe that\nnaive task augmentation without a tailored design results in underfitting.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have recently been shown to generate high quality images from\ntexts. However, existing methods struggle to create high fidelity full-body\nimages, especially multiple people. A person's pose has a high degree of\nfreedom that is difficult to describe using words only; this creates errors in\nthe generated image, such as incorrect body proportions and pose. We propose a\npose-guided text-to-image model, using pose as an additional input constraint.\nUsing the proposed Keypoint Pose Encoding (KPE) to encode human pose into low\ndimensional representation, our model can generate novel multi-person images\naccurately representing the pose and text descriptions provided, with minimal\nerrors. We demonstrate that KPE is invariant to changes in the target image\ndomain and image resolution; we show results on the Deepfashion dataset and\ncreate a new multi-person Deepfashion dataset to demonstrate the\nmulti-capabilities of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Accelerators like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been increasingly\ndeployed in modern data centers because of their compute capabilities and\nmemory bandwidth. These accelerators have traditionally relied on the\n\"application host code\" and the OS running on the CPU to orchestrate their\naccess to the data storage devices. CPU orchestration of storage data accesses\nworks well for classic GPU applications, like dense neural network training,\nwhere data access patterns are predefined, regular, dense, and independent of\nthe data values, enabling the CPU to partition the storage data into\ncoarse-grain chunks and coordinate the storage device accesses and data\ntransfers to the accelerators. Unfortunately, such a CPU-centric strategy\ncauses excessive CPU-GPU synchronization overhead and/or I/O traffic\namplification, diminishing the effective storage bandwidth for emerging\napplications with fine-grain data-dependent access patterns like graph and data\nanalytics, recommender systems, and graph neural networks. In this work, we\nmake a case for enabling GPUs to orchestrate high-throughput, fine-grain\naccesses into NVMe Solid State Drives (SSDs) in a new system architecture\ncalled BaM. BaM mitigates the I/O traffic amplification by enabling the GPU\nthreads to read or write small amounts of data on-demand, as determined by the\ncompute. We show that (1) the BaM infrastructure software running on GPUs can\nidentify and communicate the fine-grain accesses at a sufficiently high rate to\nfully utilize the underlying storage devices, (2) even with consumer-grade\nSSDs, a BaM system can support application performance that is competitive\nagainst a much more expensive DRAM-only solution, and (3) the reduction in I/O\namplification can yield significant performance benefit.",

    "abstract": "For sufficiently wide ranges of applied control signals (control voltages),\nMEMS and piezoelectric Deformable Mirrors (DMs), exhibit nonlinear behavior.\nThe nonlinear behavior manifests itself in nonlinear actuator couplings,\nnonlinear actuator deformation characteristics, and in the case of\npiezoelectric DMs, hysteresis. Furthermore, in a number of situations, DM\nbehavior can change over time, and this requires a procedure for updating the\nDM models on the basis of the observed data. If not properly modeled and if not\ntaken into account when designing control algorithms, nonlinearities, and\ntime-varying DM behavior, can significantly degrade the achievable closed-loop\nperformance of Adaptive Optics (AO) systems. Widely used approaches for DM\ncontrol are based on pre-estimated linear time-invariant DM models in the form\nof influence matrices. Often, these models are not being updated during system\noperation. Consequently, when the nonlinear DM behavior is excited by control\nsignals with wide operating ranges, or when the DM behavior changes over time,\nthe state-of-the-art DM control approaches relying upon linear control methods,\nmight not be able to produce a satisfactory closed-loop performance of an AO\nsystem. Motivated by these key facts, we present a novel method for data-driven\nDM control. Our approach combines a simple open-loop control method with a\nrecursive least squares method for dynamically updating the DM model. The DM\nmodel is constantly being updated on the basis of the dynamically changing DM\noperating points. That is, the proposed method updates both the control actions\nand the DM model during the system operation. We experimentally verify this\napproach on a Boston Micromachines MEMS DM with 140 actuators.

Mainly health care industry contains many data\nconsisting of patient and disease-related information. By using the machine\nlearning technique, we can look for hidden data patterns to predict various\ndiseases. Recently CVDs, or cardiovascular disease, have become a leading cause\nof death around the world. The number of death due to CVDs is frightening. That\nis why many researchers are trying their best to design a predictive model that\ncan save many lives using the data mining model. In this research, some fusion\nmodels have been constructed to diagnose CVDs along with its severity. Machine\nlearning(ML) algorithms like artificial neural network, SVM, logistic\nregression, decision tree, random forest, and AdaBoost have been applied to the\nheart disease dataset to predict disease. Randomoversampler was implemented\nbecause of the class imbalance in multiclass classification. To improve the\nperformance of classification, a weighted score fusion approach was taken. At\nfirst, the models were trained. After training, two algorithms' decision was\ncombined using a weighted sum rule. A total of three fusion models have been\ndeveloped from the six ML algorithms. The results were promising in the\nperformance parameter. The proposed approach has been experimented with\ndifferent test training ratios for binary and multiclass classification\nproblems, and for both of them, the fusion models performed well. The highest\naccuracy for multiclass classification was found as 75%, and it was 95% for\nbinary.

    "abstract": "For robots to be effectively deployed in novel environments and tasks, they\nmust be able to understand the feedback expressed by humans during\nintervention. This can either correct undesirable behavior or indicate\nadditional preferences. Existing methods either require repeated episodes of\ninteractions or assume prior known reward features, which is data-inefficient\nand can hardly transfer to new tasks. We relax these assumptions by describing\nhuman tasks in terms of object-centric sub-tasks and interpreting physical\ninterventions in relation to specific objects. Our method, Object Preference\nAdaptation (OPA), is composed of two key stages: 1) pre-training a base policy\nto produce a wide variety of behaviors, and 2) online-updating only certain\nweights in the model according to human feedback. The key to our fast, yet\nsimple adaptation is that general interaction dynamics between agents and\nobjects are fixed, and only object-specific preferences are updated. Our\nadaptation occurs online, requires only one human intervention (one-shot), and\nproduces new behaviors never seen during training. Trained on cheap synthetic\ndata instead of expensive human demonstrations, our policy demonstrates\nimpressive adaptation to human perturbations on challenging, realistic tasks in\nour user study.

    "abstract": "Data-driven model predictive control has two key advantages over model-free\nmethods: a potential for improved sample efficiency through model learning, and\nbetter performance as computational budget for planning increases. However, it\nis both costly to plan over long horizons and challenging to obtain an accurate\nmodel of the environment. In this work, we combine the strengths of model-free\nand model-based methods. We use a learned task-oriented latent dynamics model\nfor local trajectory optimization over a short horizon, and use a learned\nterminal value function to estimate long-term return, both of which are learned\njointly by temporal difference learning.

    "title": "Quantum cryptography with classical communication: parallel remote state  preparation for copy-protection, verification, and more",
    "abstract": "Quantum mechanical effects have enabled the construction of cryptographic\nprimitives that are impossible classically. For example, quantum\ncopy-protection allows for a program to be encoded in a quantum state in such a\nway that the program can be evaluated, but not copied. Many of these\ncryptographic primitives are two-party protocols, where one party, Bob, has\nfull quantum computational capabilities, and the other party, Alice, is only\nrequired to send random BB84 states to Bob. In this work, we show how such\nprotocols can generically be converted to ones where Alice is fully classical,\nassuming that Bob cannot efficiently solve the LWE problem. In particular, this\nmeans that all communication between (classical) Alice and (quantum) Bob is\nclassical, yet they can still make use of cryptographic primitives that would\nbe impossible if both parties were classical. We apply this conversion\nprocedure to obtain quantum cryptographic protocols with classical\ncommunication for unclonable encryption, copy-protection, computing on\nencrypted data, and verifiable blind delegated computation. The key technical\ningredient for our result is a protocol for classically-instructed parallel\nremote state preparation of BB84 states. This is a multi-round protocol between\n(classical) Alice and (quantum polynomial-time) Bob that allows Alice to\ncertify that Bob must have prepared $n$ uniformly random BB84 states (up to a\nchange of basis on his space). Furthermore, Alice knows which specific BB84\nstates Bob has prepared, while Bob himself does not. Hence, the situation at\nthe end of this protocol is (almost) equivalent to one where Alice sent $n$\nrandom BB84 states to Bob. This allows us to replace the step of preparing and\nsending BB84 states in existing protocols by our remote-state preparation\nprotocol in a generic and modular way.",

In an exploratory analysis, it is common to perform one\ncomputation on a collection of events, then view the results (often with\nhistograms) to decide what to try next. Awkward Array is a Scikit-HEP Python\npackage that enables data analysis with array-at-a-time operations to implement\ncuts as slices, combinatorics as composable functions, etc. However, most C++\nHEP libraries, such as FastJet, have an imperative, one-particle-at-a-time\ninterface, which would be inefficient in Python and goes against the grain of\nthe array-at-a-time logic of scientific Python. Therefore, we developed\nfastjet, a pip-installable Python package that provides FastJet C++ binaries,\nthe classic (particle-at-a-time) Python interface, and the new array-oriented\ninterface for use with Awkward Array.\nThe new interface streamlines interoperability with scientific Python\nsoftware beyond HEP, such as machine learning. In one case, adopting this\nlibrary along with other array-oriented tools accelerated HEP analysis code by\na factor of 20. It was designed to be easily integrated with libraries in the\nScikit-HEP ecosystem, including Uproot (file I/O), hist (histogramming), Vector\n(Lorentz vectors), and Coffea (high-level glue). We discuss the design of the\nfastjet Python library, integrating the classic interface with the array\noriented interface and with the Vector library for Lorentz vector operations.\nThe new interface was developed as open source.",

    "abstract": "Navigation bronchoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure in which doctors\npass a bronchoscope into a subject's airways to sample the target pulmonary\nlesion. A three-dimensional (3D) airway roadmap reconstructed from Computer\nTomography (CT) scans is a prerequisite for this procedure, especially when the\ntarget is distally located. Therefore, an accurate and efficient airway\nsegmentation algorithm is essential to reduce bronchoscopists' burden of\npre-procedural airway identification as well as patients' discomfort during the\nprolonged procedure. However, airway segmentation remains a challenging task\nbecause of the intrinsic complex tree-like structure, imbalanced sizes of\nairway branches, potential domain shifts of CT scans, and few available labeled\nimages. To address these problems, we present a deep learning-based pipeline,\ndenoted as NaviAirway, which finds finer bronchioles through four major novel\ncomponents - feature extractor modules in model architecture design, a\nbronchiole-sensitive loss function, a human-vision-inspired iterative training\nstrategy, and a semi-supervised learning framework to utilize unlabeled CT\nimages. Experimental results showed that NaviAirway outperformed existing\nmethods, particularly in identification of higher generation bronchioles and\nrobustness to new CT scans. On average, NaviAirway takes five minutes to\nsegment the CT scans of one patient on a GPU-embedded computer. Moreover, we\npropose two new metrics to complement conventional ones for a more\ncomprehensive and fairer evaluation of deep learning-based airway segmentation\napproaches.

    "abstract": "Skull stripping is a crucial prerequisite step in the analysis of brain\nmagnetic resonance (MR) images. Although many excellent works or tools have\nbeen proposed, they suffer from low generalization capability. For instance,\nthe model trained on a dataset with specific imaging parameters (source domain)\ncannot be well applied to other datasets with different imaging parameters\n(target domain). Especially, for the lifespan datasets, the model trained on an\nadult dataset is not applicable to an infant dataset due to the large domain\ndifference. To address this issue, numerous domain adaptation (DA) methods have\nbeen proposed to align the extracted features between the source and target\ndomains, requiring concurrent access to the input images of both domains.\nUnfortunately, it is problematic to share the images due to privacy. In this\npaper, we design a source-free domain adaptation framework (SDAF) for\nmulti-site and lifespan skull stripping that can accomplish domain adaptation\nwithout access to source domain images. Our method only needs to share the\nsource labels as shape dictionaries and the weights trained on the source data,\nwithout disclosing private information from source domain subjects. To deal\nwith the domain shift between multi-site lifespan datasets, we take advantage\nof the brain shape prior which is invariant to imaging parameters and ages.\nExperiments demonstrate that our framework can significantly outperform the\nstate-of-the-art methods on multi-site lifespan datasets.",

Indeed, the process of hashing\nconverts large data entries into compact binary arrays or hashes, enabling\nlarge-scale search operations at a very fast rate.

Our solution takes the two options and learns to\ndynamically alternate between them through the denoising process. Our proposed\nsolution is general and can be applied to any existing diffusion model. As we\nshow, when applied to various SOTA architectures, our solution immediately\nimproves their generation quality, with negligible added complexity and\nparameters.

    "abstract": "Multi-scale architectures have shown effectiveness in a variety of tasks\nincluding single image denoising, thanks to appealing cross-scale\ncomplementarity. However, existing methods treat different scale features\nequally without considering their scale-specific characteristics, i.e., the\nwithin-scale characteristics are ignored. In this paper, we reveal this missing\npiece for multi-scale architecture design and accordingly propose a novel\nMulti-Scale Adaptive Network (MSANet) for single image denoising. To be\nspecific, MSANet simultaneously embraces the within-scale characteristics and\nthe cross-scale complementarity thanks to three novel neural blocks, i.e.,\nadaptive feature block (AFeB), adaptive multi-scale block (AMB), and adaptive\nfusion block (AFuB). In brief, AFeB is designed to adaptively select details\nand filter noises, which is highly expected for fine-grained features. AMB\ncould enlarge the receptive field and aggregate the multi-scale information,\nwhich is designed to satisfy the demands of both fine- and coarse-grained\nfeatures. AFuB devotes to adaptively sampling and transferring the features\nfrom one scale to another scale, which is used to fuse the features with\nvarying characteristics from coarse to fine. Extensive experiments on both\nthree real and six synthetic noisy image datasets show the superiority of\nMSANet compared with 12 methods.",

    "title": "MICDIR: Multi-scale Inverse-consistent Deformable Image Registration  using UNetMSS with Self-Constructing Graph Latent",
    "abstract": "Image registration is the process of bringing different images into a common\ncoordinate system - a technique widely used in various applications of computer\nvision, such as remote sensing, image retrieval, and most commonly in medical\nimaging. Deep Learning based techniques have been applied successfully to\ntackle various complex medical image processing problems, including medical\nimage registration. Over the years, several image registration techniques have\nbeen proposed using deep learning. Deformable image registration techniques\nsuch as Voxelmorph have been successful in capturing finer changes and\nproviding smoother deformations. However, Voxelmorph, as well as ICNet and\nFIRE, do not explicitly encode global dependencies (i.e. the overall anatomical\nview of the supplied image) and therefore can not track large deformations. In\norder to tackle the aforementioned problems, this paper extends the Voxelmorph\napproach in three different ways. To improve the performance in case of small\nas well as large deformations, supervision of the model at different\nresolutions have been integrated using a multi-scale UNet. To support the\nnetwork to learn and encode the minute structural co-relations of the given\nimage-pairs, a self-constructing graph network (SCGNet) has been used as the\nlatent of the multi-scale UNet - which can improve the learning process of the\nmodel and help the model to generalise better. And finally, to make the\ndeformations inverse-consistent, cycle consistency loss has been employed. On\nthe task of registration of brain MRIs, the proposed method achieved\nsignificant improvements over ANTs and VoxelMorph, obtaining a Dice score of\n0.8013$\\pm$0.0243 for intramodal and 0.6211$\\pm$0.0309 for intermodal, while\nVoxelMorph achieved 0.7747$\\pm$0.0260 and 0.6071$\\pm$0.0510, respectively.",

However, this classifier has not been\nsuccessfully implemented into sleep stage classification systems due to high\ncomplexity and low accuracy of classification. The aim of this research is to\nincrease the accuracy and reduce the learning time of Convolutional Neural\nNetwork Classifier. Methodology: The proposed system used a modified Orthogonal\nConvolutional Neural Network and a modified Adam optimisation technique to\nimprove the sleep stage classification accuracy and reduce the gradient\nsaturation problem that occurs due to sigmoid activation function. The proposed\nsystem uses Leaky Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) instead of sigmoid activation\nfunction as an activation function. Results: The proposed system called\nEnhanced Sleep Stage Classification system (ESSC) used six different databases\nfor training and testing the proposed model on the different sleep stages.\nThese databases are University College Dublin database (UCD), Beth Israel\nDeaconess Medical Center MIT database (MIT-BIH), Sleep European Data Format\n(EDF), Sleep EDF Extended, Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS), and Sleep\nHeart Health Study (SHHS). Our results show that the gradient saturation\nproblem does not exist anymore. The modified Adam optimiser helps to reduce the\nnoise which in turn result in faster convergence time.

This paper presents a deep learning method to\ngenerate probabilistic forecasts of day-ahead net-load at 15-min resolution, at\nvarious solar penetration levels. Our proposed deep-learning based architecture\nutilizes the dimensional reduction, from a higher-dimensional input to a\nlower-dimensional latent space, via a convolutional Autoencoder (AE). The\nextracted features from AE are then utilized to generate probability\ndistributions across the latent space, by passing the features through a\nkernel-embedded Perron-Frobenius (kPF) operator.

Subspaces have been shown to\nprovide useful, robust representations for datasets of images, videos and more.\nSince subspaces correspond to points on a Grassmann manifold, one is led to\nconsider the idea of a subspace prototype for a Grassmann-valued dataset. While\na number of different subspace prototypes have been described, the calculation\nof some of these prototypes has proven to be computationally expensive while\nother prototypes are affected by outliers and produce highly imperfect\nclustering on noisy data. This work proposes a new subspace prototype, the flag\nmedian, and introduces the FlagIRLS algorithm for its calculation.

To efficiently solve the\n\"separable\" MILP combinatorial problems, decomposition, and coordination\nSurrogate \"Level-Based\" Lagrangian Relaxation method is developed. The new\nmethod efficiently exploits the underlying geometric-convergence potential -\nthe best convergence theoretically possible - inherent to Polyak's step-sizing\nformula in the dual space without the need to know the optimal dual value\nrequired for convergence. Unlike all the previous methods to obtain \"level\"\nestimates of the optimal dual value by adjusting hyperparameters, the key novel\nidea to obtain \"level\" value is through a hyper-parameter-free optimization: a\nnovel \"multiplier-convergence-feasibility\" Linear Programming constraint\nsatisfaction problem needs to be solved, from which, in conjunction with the\nPolyak's formula, the sought-for \"level\" estimate is inferred. Testing results\nfor medium- and large-scale instances of standard Generalized Assignment\nProblems from OR-library demonstrate that 1. \"level\" estimates generally\ndecrease and the dual values increase faster than those obtained by using other\nexisting methods, 2. the new method is computationally efficient in terms of\nthe quality of solutions (for several large-scale cases, optimal solutions are\nobtained) and in terms of the CPU time, 3. the new method is robust with\nrespect to the choice of initial parameters such as step-sizes and multipliers.\nMoreover, the procedure to estimate the \"level\" value is independent of\nlinearity and separability of the problem, and thus the new method also paves\nthe way for efficient resolution of general Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP)\nproblems.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) for design is a relatively new but active area\nof research across many disciplines. Surprisingly when it comes to designing\ndetectors with AI this is an area at its infancy. The Electron Ion Collider is\nthe ultimate machine to study the strong force. The EIC is a large-scale\nexperiment with an integrated detector that extends for about $\\pm$35 meters to\ninclude the central, far-forward, and far-backward regions. The design of the\ncentral detector is made by multiple sub-detectors, each in principle\ncharacterized by a multidimensional design space and multiple design criteria\nalso called objectives. Simulations with Geant4 are typically compute\nintensive, and the optimization of the detector design may include\nnon-differentiable terms as well as noisy objectives. In this context, AI can\noffer state of the art solutions to solve complex combinatorial problems in an\nefficient way. In particular, one of the proto-collaborations, ECCE, has\nexplored during the detector proposal the possibility of using multi-objective\noptimization to design the tracking system of the EIC detector. This document\nprovides an overview of these techniques and recent progress made during the\nEIC detector proposal.

    "abstract": "For an integer linear optimization (ILO) problem, persistency of its linear\noptimization (LO) relaxation is a property that for every optimal solution of\nthe relaxation that assigns integer values to some variables, there exists an\noptimal solution of the ILO problem in which these variables retain the same\nvalues. Although persistency has been used to develop heuristic, approximation,\nand fixed-parameter algorithms for special cases of ILO, its applicability\nremains unknown in the literature. In this paper we reveal a maximal subclass\nof ILO such that its LO relaxation has persistency. Specifically, we show that\nthe LO relaxation of ILO on unit-two-variable-per-inequality (UTVPI) systems\nhas persistency and is (in a certain sense) maximal among such ILO. Our\npersistency result generalizes the results of Nemhauser and Trotter, Hochbaum\net al., and Fiorini et al. Even more, we propose a stronger property called\n\\emph{neighborhood persistency} and show that the LO relaxation of ILO on UTVPI\nsystems in general has this property. Using this stronger result, we obtain a\nfixed-parameter algorithm (where the parameter is the solution size) and\nanother proof of two-approximability for ILO on UTVPI systems where objective\nfunctions and variables are non-negative.",

    "abstract": "A large-scale labeled dataset is a key factor for the success of supervised\ndeep learning in computer vision. However, a limited number of annotated data\nis very common, especially in ophthalmic image analysis, since manual\nannotation is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Self-supervised learning\n(SSL) methods bring huge opportunities for better utilizing unlabeled data, as\nthey do not need massive annotations. With an attempt to use as many as\npossible unlabeled ophthalmic images, it is necessary to break the dimension\nbarrier, simultaneously making use of both 2D and 3D images. In this paper, we\npropose a universal self-supervised Transformer framework, named Uni4Eye, to\ndiscover the inherent image property and capture domain-specific feature\nembedding in ophthalmic images. Uni4Eye can serve as a global feature\nextractor, which builds its basis on a Masked Image Modeling task with a Vision\nTransformer (ViT) architecture. We employ a Unified Patch Embedding module to\nreplace the origin patch embedding module in ViT for jointly processing both 2D\nand 3D input images. Besides, we design a dual-branch multitask decoder module\nto simultaneously perform two reconstruction tasks on the input image and its\ngradient map, delivering discriminative representations for better convergence.\nWe evaluate the performance of our pre-trained Uni4Eye encoder by fine-tuning\nit on six downstream ophthalmic image classification tasks.

The deterministic Hadamard basis\nhas become an alternative choice due to its orthogonality and structural\ncharacteristics. There is evidence that sorting the Hadamard basis is\nbeneficial to further reduce the sampling rate, thus many orderings have\nemerged, but their relations remain unclear and lack a unified theory. Given\nthis, here we specially propose a concept named selection history, which can\nrecord the Hadamard spatial folding process, and build a model based on it to\nreveal the formation mechanisms of different orderings and to deduce the mutual\nconversion relationship among them. Then, a weight ordering of the Hadamard\nbasis is proposed. Both numerical simulation and experimental results have\ndemonstrated that with this weight sort technique, the sampling rate,\nreconstruction time and matrix memory consumption are greatly reduced in\ncomparison to traditional sorting methods. Therefore, we believe that this\nmethod may pave the way for real-time single-pixel imaging.",

    "abstract": "Multi-task learning for molecular property prediction is becoming\nincreasingly important in drug discovery. However, in contrast to other\ndomains, the performance of multi-task learning in drug discovery is still not\nsatisfying as the number of labeled data for each task is too limited, which\ncalls for additional data to complement the data scarcity. In this paper, we\nstudy multi-task learning for molecular property prediction in a novel setting,\nwhere a relation graph between tasks is available. We first construct a dataset\nincluding around 400 tasks as well as a task relation graph. Then to better\nutilize such relation graph, we propose a method called SGNN-EBM to\nsystematically investigate the structured task modeling from two perspectives.\n(1) In the \\emph{latent} space, we model the task representations by applying a\nstate graph neural network (SGNN) on the relation graph. (2) In the\n\\emph{output} space, we employ structured prediction with the energy-based\nmodel (EBM), which can be efficiently trained through noise-contrastive\nestimation (NCE) approach. Empirical results justify the effectiveness of\nSGNN-EBM. Code is available on https://github.com/chao1224/SGNN-EBM.",

    "abstract": "Data representativity is crucial when drawing inference from data through\nmachine learning models. Scholars have increased focus on unraveling the bias\nand fairness in the models, also in relation to inherent biases in the input\ndata. However, limited work exists on the representativity of samples\n(datasets) for appropriate inference in AI systems. This paper analyzes data\nrepresentativity in scientific literature related to AI and sampling, and gives\na brief overview of statistical sampling methodology from disciplines like\nsampling of physical materials, experimental design, survey analysis, and\nobservational studies. Different notions of a 'representative sample' exist in\npast and present literature. In particular, the contrast between the notion of\na representative sample in the sense of coverage of the input space, versus a\nrepresentative sample as a miniature of the target population is of relevance\nwhen building AI systems. Using empirical demonstrations on US Census data, we\ndemonstrate that the first is useful for providing equality and demographic\nparity, and is more robust to distribution shifts, whereas the latter notion is\nuseful in situations where the purpose is to make historical inference or draw\ninference about the underlying population in general, or make better\npredictions for the majority in the underlying population. We propose a\nframework of questions for creating and documenting data, with data\nrepresentativity in mind, as an addition to existing datasheets for datasets.\nFinally, we will also like to call for caution of implicit, in addition to\nexplicit, use of a notion of data representativeness without specific\nclarification.",

Previous evidence shows\nthat the brain network generated from diffusion MRI promises to classify\ndementia using deep learning.

In this study, we develop a self-supervised\ncontrastive learning approach to generate structural brain networks from\nroutine anatomical MRI under the guidance of diffusion MRI. The generated brain\nnetworks are applied to train a learning framework for predicting the MCI-to-AD\nconversion. Instead of directly modelling the AD brain networks, we train a\ngraph encoder and a variational autoencoder to model the healthy ageing\ntrajectories from brain networks of healthy controls. To predict the MCI-to-AD\nconversion, we further design a recurrent neural networks based approach to\nmodel the longitudinal deviation of patients' brain networks from the healthy\nageing trajectory.

Due to quantum channels' destructive nature, a fundamental\nproblem in quantum information theory is how well we can retrieve information\nfrom noisy quantum states. In this work, we introduce a systematic framework to\nquantitatively study this problem. First, we prove that classical information\ncan be retrieved if and only if the querying observable is in the image of the\nwhole observable space under the channel's adjoint. Second, we further define\nthe dimension of the evolved observable space as the quantum channel's\neffective shadow dimension that quantifies the information recoverability of\nthe channel. This quantity can be computed as the rank of a matrix derived from\nthe channel's Kraus operators, and it induces the shadow destructivity as a\nmeasure with meaningful properties. Third, we resolve the minimum cost of\nretrieving a piece of shadow information from the required number of copies of\na noisy state. We in particular show that the optimal cost and the\ncorresponding protocol are efficiently computable by semidefinite programming.\nAs applications, we derive the ultimate limits on shadow retrieving costs for\ngeneralized amplitude damping channels and mixed Pauli channels and employ the\ncorresponding protocol to mitigate errors in tasks of ground state energy\nestimation.",

By adding a differentiable optical forward model\ninto the modeling framework, we change the data-driven modeling space from the\npixels to the wavefront. The proposed model relies on efficient automatic\ndifferentiation technology as well as modern stochastic first-order\noptimization techniques recently developed by the thriving machine-learning\ncommunity. Our framework paves the way to building powerful models that are\nphysically motivated and do not require special calibration data. This paper\ndemonstrates the WaveDiff model on a simplified setting of a space telescope.\nThe proposed framework represents a performance breakthrough with respect to\nexisting data-driven approaches. The pixel reconstruction errors decrease\n6-fold at observation resolution and 44-fold for a 3x super-resolution. The\nellipticity errors are reduced by a factor of at least 20 and the size error by\na factor of more than 250. By only using noisy broad-band in-focus\nobservations, we successfully capture the PSF chromatic variations due to\ndiffraction.",

    "abstract": "Systems are commonly monitored for health and security through collection and\nstreaming of multivariate time series. Advances in time series forecasting due\nto adoption of multilayer recurrent neural network architectures make it\npossible to forecast in high-dimensional time series, and identify and classify\nnovelties early, based on subtle changes in the trends. However, mainstream\napproaches to multi-variate time series predictions do not handle well cases\nwhen the ongoing forecast must include uncertainty, nor they are robust to\nmissing data. We introduce a new architecture for time series monitoring based\non combination of state-of-the-art methods of forecasting in high-dimensional\ntime series with full probabilistic handling of uncertainty. We demonstrate\nadvantage of the architecture for time series forecasting and novelty\ndetection, in particular with partially missing data, and empirically evaluate\nand compare the architecture to state-of-the-art approaches on a real-world\ndata set.",

    "title": "Why Interpretable Causal Inference is Important for High-Stakes Decision  Making for Critically Ill Patients and How To Do It",
    "abstract": "Many fundamental problems affecting the care of critically ill patients lead\nto similar analytical challenges: physicians cannot easily estimate the effects\nof at-risk medical conditions or treatments because the causal effects of\nmedical conditions and drugs are entangled. They also cannot easily perform\nstudies: there are not enough high-quality data for high-dimensional\nobservational causal inference, and RCTs often cannot ethically be conducted.\nHowever, mechanistic knowledge is available, including how drugs are absorbed\ninto the body, and the combination of this knowledge with the limited data\ncould potentially suffice -- if we knew how to combine them. In this work, we\npresent a framework for interpretable estimation of causal effects for\ncritically ill patients under exactly these complex conditions: interactions\nbetween drugs and observations over time, patient data sets that are not large,\nand mechanistic knowledge that can substitute for lack of data. We apply this\nframework to an extremely important problem affecting critically ill patients,\nnamely the effect of seizures and other potentially harmful electrical events\nin the brain (called epileptiform activity -- EA) on outcomes. Given the high\nstakes involved and the high noise in the data, interpretability is critical\nfor troubleshooting such complex problems. Interpretability of our matched\ngroups allowed neurologists to perform chart reviews to verify the quality of\nour causal analysis. For instance, our work indicates that a patient who\nexperiences a high level of seizure-like activity (75% high EA burden) and is\nuntreated for a six-hour window, has, on average, a 16.7% increased chance of\nadverse outcomes such as severe brain damage, lifetime disability, or death. We\nfind that patients with mild but long-lasting EA (average EA burden >= 50%)\nhave their risk of an adverse outcome increased by 11.2%.",
