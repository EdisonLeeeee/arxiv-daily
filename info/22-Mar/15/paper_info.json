    "abstract": "For humans, our \"senses of touch\" have always been necessary for our ability\nto precisely and efficiently manipulate objects of all shapes in any\nenvironment, but until recently, not many works have been done to fully\nunderstand haptic feedback. This work proposed a novel method for getting a\nbetter shape descriptor than existing methods for classifying an object from\nmultiple tactile data collected from a tactile glove. It focuses on improving\nprevious works on object classification using tactile data. The major problem\nfor object classification from multiple tactile data is to find a good way to\naggregate features extracted from multiple tactile images. We propose a novel\nmethod, dubbed as Tactile-ViewGCN, that hierarchically aggregate tactile\nfeatures considering relations among different features by using Graph\nConvolutional Network. Our model outperforms previous methods on the STAG\ndataset with an accuracy of 81.82%.",

    "title": "When classifying grammatical role, BERT doesn't care about word order...  except when it matters",
    "abstract": "Because meaning can often be inferred from lexical semantics alone, word\norder is often a redundant cue in natural language. For example, the words\nchopped, chef, and onion are more likely used to convey \"The chef chopped the\nonion,\" not \"The onion chopped the chef.\" Recent work has shown large language\nmodels to be surprisingly word order invariant, but crucially has largely\nconsidered natural prototypical inputs, where compositional meaning mostly\nmatches lexical expectations. To overcome this confound, we probe grammatical\nrole representation in English BERT and GPT-2, on instances where lexical\nexpectations are not sufficient, and word order knowledge is necessary for\ncorrect classification. Such non-prototypical instances are naturally occurring\nEnglish sentences with inanimate subjects or animate objects, or sentences\nwhere we systematically swap the arguments to make sentences like \"The onion\nchopped the chef\". We find that, while early layer embeddings are largely\nlexical, word order is in fact crucial in defining the later-layer\nrepresentations of words in semantically non-prototypical positions. Our\nexperiments isolate the effect of word order on the contextualization process,\nand highlight how models use context in the uncommon, but critical, instances\nwhere it matters.",

    "title": "Staged Training for Transformer Language Models",
    "abstract": "The current standard approach to scaling transformer language models trains\neach model size from a different random initialization. As an alternative, we\nconsider a staged training setup that begins with a small model and\nincrementally increases the amount of compute used for training by applying a\n\"growth operator\" to increase the model depth and width. By initializing each\nstage with the output of the previous one, the training process effectively\nre-uses the compute from prior stages and becomes more efficient. Our growth\noperators each take as input the entire training state (including model\nparameters, optimizer state, learning rate schedule, etc.) and output a new\ntraining state from which training continues. We identify two important\nproperties of these growth operators, namely that they preserve both the loss\nand the \"training dynamics\" after applying the operator. While the\nloss-preserving property has been discussed previously, to the best of our\nknowledge this work is the first to identify the importance of preserving the\ntraining dynamics (the rate of decrease of the loss during training). To find\nthe optimal schedule for stages, we use the scaling laws from (Kaplan et al.,\n2020) to find a precise schedule that gives the most compute saving by starting\na new stage when training efficiency starts decreasing. We empirically validate\nour growth operators and staged training for autoregressive language models,\nshowing up to 22% compute savings compared to a strong baseline trained from\nscratch.

One of the major reasons for this gap is the difficulty in\ncollecting sufficient amounts of annotated relations and attributes for\ntraining these systems. While some attributes and relations are abundant, the\ndistribution in the natural world and existing datasets is long tailed. In this\npaper, we address this problem by introducing a novel incremental active\nlearning framework that asks for attributes and relations in visual scenes.\nWhile conventional active learning methods ask for labels of specific examples,\nwe flip this framing to allow agents to ask for examples from specific\ncategories. Using this framing, we introduce an active sampling method that\nasks for examples from the tail of the data distribution and show that it\noutperforms classical active learning methods on Visual Genome.",

Many programming abstractions (e.g.,\nconcurrent objects, transactional memory, etc) simplify matters, but still\ninvolve intricate engineering. We argue that some difficulty of multicore\nprogramming can be meliorated through a declarative programming style in which\nprogrammers directly express the independence of fragments of sequential\nprograms.\nIn our proposed paradigm, programmers write programs in a familiar,\nsequential manner, with the added ability to explicitly express the conditions\nunder which code fragments commute. Putting such commutativity conditions into\nsource code offers a new entry point to exploit the known connection between\ncommutativity and parallelism. We give sequential and concurrent semantics for\ncommute statements, as well as a correctness condition called scoped\nserializability and discuss how it can be enforced when combined with\ncommutativity conditions.\nWe next describe a technique for automatically synthesizing commute\nconditions directly from source code via a new reduction to commutativity of\nobject methods. We implemented our work in a new language called Veracity,\nimplemented in Multicore OCaml and on top of Servois and the libcuckoo\nconcurrent hashtable. We provide the first benchmarks programs with commute\nblocks.

We study two\nMedAI systems: mediKanren (disease independent) and CancerMine\n(Disease-specific), which use research literature as primary data input from\nthe research repository PubMed, PubMed derived database SemMedDB, and NIH\ntranslational Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Our study has a three-pronged focus: (1)\nidentifying the PPP in PubMed; (2) verifying the PPP in SemMedDB and the KGs;\n(3) demonstrating the existing vulnerability of PPP traversing to the MedAI\noutput. Our contribution lies in identifying the existing PPP in the MedAI\ninputs and demonstrating how predatory science can jeopardize the credibility\nof MedAI solutions, making their real-life deployment questionable.",

    "abstract": "Despite growing calls for participation in AI design, there are to date few\nempirical studies of what these processes look like and how they can be\nstructured for meaningful engagement with domain experts. In this paper, we\nexamine a notable yet understudied AI design process in the legal domain that\ntook place over a decade ago, the impact of which still informs legal\nautomation efforts today. Specifically, we examine the design and evaluation\nactivities that took place from 2006 to 2011 within the TeXT Retrieval\nConference's (TREC) Legal Track, a computational research venue hosted by the\nNational Institute of Standards and Technologies. The Legal Track of TREC is\nnotable in the history of AI research and practice because it relied on a range\nof participatory approaches to facilitate the design and evaluation of new\ncomputational techniques--in this case, for automating attorney document review\nfor civil litigation matters. Drawing on archival research and interviews with\ncoordinators of the Legal Track of TREC, our analysis reveals how an\ninteractive simulation methodology allowed computer scientists and lawyers to\nbecome co-designers and helped bridge the chasm between computational research\nand real-world, high-stakes litigation practice. In analyzing this case from\nthe recent past, our aim is to empirically ground contemporary critiques of AI\ndevelopment and evaluation and the calls for greater participation as a means\nto address them.",

    "abstract": "Pressure ulcers are a challenge for patients and healthcare professionals. In\nthe UK, 700,000 people are affected by pressure ulcers each year. Treating them\ncosts the National Health Service {\\pounds}3.8 million every day. Their\netiology is complex and multifactorial. However, evidence has shown a strong\nlink between old age, disease-related sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy eating\nhabits. Pressure ulcers are caused by direct skin contact with a bed or chair\nwithout frequent position changes. Urinary and faecal incontinence, diabetes,\nand injuries that restrict body position and nutrition are also known risk\nfactors. Guidelines and treatments exist but their implementation and success\nvary across different healthcare settings. This is primarily because healthcare\npractitioners have a) minimal experience in dealing with pressure ulcers, and\nb) a general lack of understanding of pressure ulcer treatments. Poorly\nmanaged, pressure ulcers lead to severe pain, poor quality of life, and\nsignificant healthcare costs. In this paper, we report the findings of a\nclinical trial conducted by Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust that evaluated the\nperformance of a faster region-based convolutional neural network and mobile\nplatform that categorised and documented pressure ulcers. The neural network\nclassifies category I, II, III, and IV pressure ulcers, deep tissue injuries,\nand unstageable pressure ulcers. Photographs of pressure ulcers taken by\ndistrict nurses are transmitted over 4/5G communications to an inferencing\nserver for classification. Classified images are stored and reviewed to assess\nthe model's predictions and relevance as a tool for clinical decision making\nand standardised reporting.

    "abstract": "While deep learning surpasses human-level performance in narrow and specific\nvision tasks, it is fragile and over-confident in classification. For example,\nminor transformations in perspective, illumination, or object deformation in\nthe image space can result in drastically different labeling, which is\nespecially transparent via adversarial perturbations. On the other hand, human\nvisual perception is orders of magnitude more robust to changes in the input\nstimulus. But unfortunately, we are far from fully understanding and\nintegrating the underlying mechanisms that result in such robust perception. In\nthis work, we introduce a novel method of incorporating temporal dynamics into\nstatic image understanding. We describe a neuro-inspired method that decomposes\na single image into a series of coarse-to-fine images that simulates how\nbiological vision integrates information over time. Next, we demonstrate how\nour novel visual perception framework can utilize this information \"over time\"\nusing a biologically plausible algorithm with recurrent units, and as a result,\nsignificantly improving its accuracy and robustness over standard CNNs. We also\ncompare our proposed approach with state-of-the-art models and explicitly\nquantify our adversarial robustness properties through multiple ablation\nstudies.

    "abstract": "Link-adaptation (LA) is one of the most important aspects of wireless\ncommunications where the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) used by the\ntransmitter is adapted to the channel conditions in order to meet a certain\ntarget error-rate. In a single-user SISO (SU-SISO) system, LA is performed by\ncomputing the post-equalization signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) at\nthe receiver. The same technique can be employed in multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO)\nreceivers that use linear detectors. Another important use of post-equalization\nSINR is for physical layer (PHY) abstraction, where several PHY blocks like the\nchannel encoder, the detector, and the channel decoder are replaced by an\nabstraction model in order to speed up system-level simulations. This is\nachieved by mapping the post-equalization SINR to a codeword error rate (CER)\nor a block error rate (BLER). However, for MU-MIMO systems with non-linear\nreceivers, like those that use variants of the sphere-decoder algorithm, there\nis no known equivalent of post-equalization SINR which makes both LA and PHY\nabstraction extremely challenging. This important issue is addressed in this\ntwo-part paper. A metric called the bit-metric decoding rate (BMDR) of a\ndetector for a set of channel realizations is presented in this part. BMDR is\nthe proposed equivalent of post-equalization SINR for arbitrary detectors.\nSince BMDR does not have a closed form expression that would enable its\ninstantaneous calculation, a machine-learning approach to predict it is\npresented. The second part describes the algorithms to perform LA, detector\nselection, and PHY abstraction using BMDR for MU-MIMO systems with arbitrary\ndetectors. Extensive simulation results corroborating the claims are presented.",

To tackle these\nproblems, we construct reduced basis/ multiscale ansatz functions defined in\nspace that can be combined with time stepping schemes within model order\nreduction or multiscale methods. To that end, we propose to perform several\nsimulations of the PDE for few time steps in parallel starting at different,\nrandomly drawn start points, prescribing random initial conditions; applying a\nsingular value decomposition to a subset of the so obtained snapshots yields\nthe reduced basis/ multiscale ansatz functions. This facilitates constructing\nthe reduced basis/ multiscale ansatz functions in an embarrassingly parallel\nmanner. In detail, we suggest using a data-dependent probability distribution\nbased on the data functions of the PDE to select the start points. Each local\nin time simulation of the PDE with random initial conditions approximates a\nlocal approximation space in one time point that is optimal in the sense of\nKolmogorov. The derivation of these optimal local approximation spaces which\nare spanned by the left singular vectors of a compact transfer operator that\nmaps arbitrary initial conditions to the solution of the PDE in a later point\nof time, is one other main contribution of this paper. By solving the PDE\nlocally in time with random initial conditions, we construct local ansatz\nspaces in time that converge provably at a quasi-optimal rate and allow for\nlocal error control.

Second, due to\ntheir worst-case nature, the existing upper bound analysis fails to adapt to\neasier problem instances within the function class. Our work takes steps to\naddress both these issues. First, we derive \\emph{instance-dependent} regret\nlower bounds for algorithms with uniformly~(over the function class) vanishing\nnormalized cumulative regret.

As a result, the generated images usually contain\nartifacts or the filled pixels differ greatly from the ground truth.\nImage-level predictive filtering is a widely used image restoration technique,\npredicting suitable kernels adaptively according to different input scenes.\nInspired by this inherent advantage, we explore the possibility of addressing\nimage inpainting as a filtering task. To this end, we first study the\nadvantages and challenges of image-level predictive filtering for image\ninpainting: the method can preserve local structures and avoid artifacts but\nfails to fill large missing areas. Then, we propose semantic filtering by\nconducting filtering on the deep feature level, which fills the missing\nsemantic information but fails to recover the details. To address the issues\nwhile adopting the respective advantages, we propose a novel filtering\ntechnique, i.e., Multilevel Interactive Siamese Filtering (MISF), which\ncontains two branches: kernel prediction branch (KPB) and semantic & image\nfiltering branch (SIFB). These two branches are interactively linked: SIFB\nprovides multi-level features for KPB while KPB predicts dynamic kernels for\nSIFB. As a result, the final method takes the advantage of effective semantic &\nimage-level filling for high-fidelity inpainting. We validate our method on\nthree challenging datasets, i.e., Dunhuang, Places2, and CelebA. Our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines on four metrics, i.e., L1, PSNR, SSIM,\nand LPIPS.

    "abstract": "Entity alignment is to find identical entities in different knowledge graphs.\nAlthough embedding-based entity alignment has recently achieved remarkable\nprogress, training data insufficiency remains a critical challenge.\nConventional semi-supervised methods also suffer from the incorrect entity\nalignment in newly proposed training data. To resolve these issues, we design\nan iterative cycle-teaching framework for semi-supervised entity alignment. The\nkey idea is to train multiple entity alignment models (called aligners)\nsimultaneously and let each aligner iteratively teach its successor the\nproposed new entity alignment. We propose a diversity-aware alignment selection\nmethod to choose reliable entity alignment for each aligner. We also design a\nconflict resolution mechanism to resolve the alignment conflict when combining\nthe new alignment of an aligner and that from its teacher. Besides, considering\nthe influence of cycle-teaching order, we elaborately design a strategy to\narrange the optimal order that can maximize the overall performance of multiple\naligners. The cycle-teaching process can break the limitations of each model's\nlearning capability and reduce the noise in new training data, leading to\nimproved performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed cycle-teaching framework, which significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art models when the training data is insufficient\nand the new entity alignment has much noise.",

Existing approaches to leverage the benefits of IRS involve a\nresource-intensive channel estimation step followed by a computationally\nexpensive algorithm to optimize the reflection coefficients at the IRS. In this\nwork, we present and analyze several alternative schemes, where the phase\nconfiguration of the IRS is randomized and multi-user diversity is exploited to\nopportunistically select the best user at each point in time for data\ntransmission. We show that the throughput of an IRS assisted opportunistic\nsystem asymptotically converges to the optimal beamforming-based throughput\nunder fair allocation of resources, as the number of users gets large. Further,\nfor all the proposed schemes, we derive the scaling law of the throughput in\nterms of the number of users and IRS elements, as the number of users gets\nlarge. We also introduce schemes that enhance the rate of convergence of the\nopportunistic rate to the beamforming rate as the number of users is increased.\nFollowing this, we extend the setup to wideband channels via an orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system and discuss two opportunistic\nschemes in an IRS assisted setting that elucidate the superior performance that\nIRS aided systems can offer over conventional systems at very low\nimplementation cost and complexity.",

However, due to a tremendous\namount of parameters, state-of-the-art GANs usually suffer from low efficiency\nand bulky memory usage. To tackle this challenge, firstly, this paper\ninvestigates GANs performance from a frequency perspective. The results show\nthat GANs, especially small GANs lack the ability to generate high-quality high\nfrequency information. To address this problem, we propose a novel knowledge\ndistillation method referred to as wavelet knowledge distillation. Instead of\ndirectly distilling the generated images of teachers, wavelet knowledge\ndistillation first decomposes the images into different frequency bands with\ndiscrete wavelet transformation and then only distills the high frequency\nbands. As a result, the student GAN can pay more attention to its learning on\nhigh frequency bands. Experiments demonstrate that our method leads to 7.08\ntimes compression and 6.80 times acceleration on CycleGAN with almost no\nperformance drop. Additionally, we have studied the relation between\ndiscriminators and generators which shows that the compression of\ndiscriminators can promote the performance of compressed generators.",

When each individual autonomous\nvehicle is originally self-interest, we can not assume that all agents would\ncooperate naturally during the training process. In this work, we propose to\nreallocate the system's total reward efficiently to motivate stable cooperation\namong autonomous vehicles. We formally define and quantify how to reallocate\nthe system's total reward to each agent under the proposed transferable utility\ngame, such that communication-based cooperation among multi-agents increases\nthe system's total reward. We prove that Shapley value-based reward\nreallocation of MARL locates in the core if the transferable utility game is a\nconvex game. Hence, the cooperation is stable and efficient and the agents\nshould stay in the coalition or the cooperating group. We then propose a\ncooperative policy learning algorithm with Shapley value reward reallocation.\nIn experiments, compared with several literature algorithms, we show the\nimprovement of the mean episode system reward of CAV systems using our proposed\nalgorithm.",

    "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have gained increasing popularity as they are\ncommonly believed to own higher modeling capacity and representation\nflexibility, than traditional convolutional networks. However, it is\nquestionable whether such potential has been fully unleashed in practice, as\nthe learned ViTs often suffer from over-smoothening, yielding likely redundant\nmodels. Recent works made preliminary attempts to identify and alleviate such\nredundancy, e.g., via regularizing embedding similarity or re-injecting\nconvolution-like structures. However, a \"head-to-toe assessment\" regarding the\nextent of redundancy in ViTs, and how much we could gain by thoroughly\nmitigating such, has been absent for this field. This paper, for the first\ntime, systematically studies the ubiquitous existence of redundancy at all\nthree levels: patch embedding, attention map, and weight space. In view of\nthem, we advocate a principle of diversity for training ViTs, by presenting\ncorresponding regularizers that encourage the representation diversity and\ncoverage at each of those levels, that enabling capturing more discriminative\ninformation. Extensive experiments on ImageNet with a number of ViT backbones\nvalidate the effectiveness of our proposals, largely eliminating the observed\nViT redundancy and significantly boosting the model generalization. For\nexample, our diversified DeiT obtains 0.70%~1.76% accuracy boosts on ImageNet\nwith highly reduced similarity. Our codes are fully available in\nhttps://github.com/VITA-Group/Diverse-ViT.",

Moreover, as AUs are\ndynamic processes, the utilization of global temporal information is important\nbut has been gravely ignored in the literature.

    "abstract": "Translating visual data into natural language is essential for machines to\nunderstand the world and interact with humans. In this work, a comprehensive\nstudy is conducted on video paragraph captioning, with the goal to generate\nparagraph-level descriptions for a given video. However, current researches\nmainly focus on detecting objective facts, ignoring the needs to establish the\nlogical associations between sentences and to discover more accurate emotions\nrelated to video contents. Such a problem impairs fluent and abundant\nexpressions of predicted captions, which are far below human language tandards.\nTo solve this problem, we propose to construct a large-scale emotion and logic\ndriven multilingual dataset for this task. This dataset is named EMVPC\n(standing for \"Emotional Video Paragraph Captioning\") and contains 53\nwidely-used emotions in daily life, 376 common scenes corresponding to these\nemotions, 10,291 high-quality videos and 20,582 elaborated paragraph captions\nwith English and Chinese versions. Relevant emotion categories, scene labels,\nemotion word labels and logic word labels are also provided in this new\ndataset. The proposed EMVPC dataset intends to provide full-fledged video\nparagraph captioning in terms of rich emotions, coherent logic and elaborate\nexpressions, which can also benefit other tasks in vision-language fields.\nFurthermore, a comprehensive study is conducted through experiments on existing\nbenchmark video paragraph captioning datasets and the proposed EMVPC. The\nstateof-the-art schemes from different visual captioning tasks are compared in\nterms of 15 popular metrics, and their detailed objective as well as subjective\nresults are summarized. Finally, remaining problems and future directions of\nvideo paragraph captioning are also discussed. The unique perspective of this\nwork is expected to boost further development in video paragraph captioning\nresearch.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is expected to revolutionize the existing\nintegrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system and promise a more flexible\njoint design. Nevertheless, the existing works on ISAC mainly focus on\nexploring the performance of both functionalities simultaneously during the\nentire considered period, which may ignore the practical asymmetric sensing and\ncommunication requirements. In particular, always forcing sensing along with\ncommunication may make it is harder to balance between these two\nfunctionalities due to shared spectrum resources and limited transmit power. To\naddress this issue, we propose a new integrated periodic sensing and\ncommunication mechanism for the UAV-enabled ISAC system to provide a more\nflexible trade-off between two integrated functionalities. Specifically, the\nsystem achievable rate is maximized via jointly optimizing UAV trajectory, user\nassociation, target sensing selection, and transmit beamforming, while meeting\nthe sensing frequency and beam pattern gain requirement for the given targets.\nDespite that this problem is highly non-convex and involves closely coupled\ninteger variables, we derive the closed-form optimal beamforming vector to\ndramatically reduce the complexity of beamforming design, and present a tight\nlower bound of the achievable rate to facilitate UAV trajectory design. Based\non the above results, we propose a penalty-based algorithm to efficiently solve\nthe considered problem. The optimal achievable rate and the optimal UAV\nlocation are analyzed under a special case of infinity number of antennas.\nFurthermore, we prove the structural symmetry between the optimal solutions in\ndifferent ISAC frames without location constraints and propose an efficient\nalgorithm for solving the problem with location constraints.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models tend to underperform in the presence of domain shifts.\nDomain transfer has recently emerged as a promising approach wherein images\nexhibiting a domain shift are transformed into other domains for augmentation\nor adaptation. However, with the absence of paired and annotated images, most\ndomain transfer methods mainly rely on adversarial networks and weak cycle\nconsistency, which could result in incomplete domain transfer or poor adherence\nto the original image content. In this paper, we introduce MDT-Net to address\nthe limitations above through a multi-domain transfer model based on perceptual\nsupervision. Specifically, our model consists of an encoder-decoder network,\nwhich aims to preserve anatomical structures, and multiple domain-specific\ntransfer modules, which guide the domain transition through feature\ntransformation. During the inference, MDT-Net can directly transfer images from\nthe source domain to multiple target domains at one time without any reference\nimage. To demonstrate the performance of MDT-Net, we evaluate it on RETOUCH\ndataset, comprising OCT scans from three different scanner devices (domains),\nfor multi-domain transfer. We also take the transformed results as additional\ntraining images for fluid segmentation in OCT scans in the tasks of domain\nadaptation and data augmentation. Experimental results show that MDT-Net can\noutperform other domain transfer models qualitatively and quantitatively.\nFurthermore, the significant improvement in dice scores over multiple\nsegmentation models also demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our\nproposed method.",

    "abstract": "Website fingerprinting attack (WFA) aims to deanonymize the website a user is\nvisiting through anonymous networks channels (e.g., Tor). Despite of remarkable\nprogress in the past years, most existing methods make implicitly a couple of\nartificial assumptions that (1) only a single website (i.e., single-tab) is\nvisited each time, and (2) website fingerprinting data are pre-trimmed into a\nsingle trace per website manually. In reality, a user often open multiple tabs\nfor multiple websites spontaneously. Indeed, this multi-tab WFA (MT-WFA)\nsetting has been studied in a few recent works, but all of them still fail to\nfully respect the real-world situations. In particular, the overlapping\nchallenge between website fingerprinting has never been investigated in depth.\nIn this work, we redefine the problem of MT-WFA as detecting multiple monitored\ntraces, given a natural untrimmed traffic data including monitored traces,\nunmonitored traces, and potentially unconstrained overlapping between them.\nThis eliminates the above assumptions, going beyond the conventional single\nwebsite fingerprint classification perspective taken by all previous WFA\nmethods. To tackle this realistic MT-WFA problem, we formulate a novel Website\nFingerprint Detection (WFD) model capable of detecting accurately the start and\nend points of all the monitored traces and classifying them jointly, given\nlong, untrimmed raw traffic data. WFD is end-to-end, with the trace\nlocalization and website classification integrated in a single unified\npipeline. To enable quantitative evaluation in our MT-WFA setting, we introduce\nnew performance metrics. Extensive experiments on several newly constructed\nbenchmarks show that our WFD outperforms the state-of-the-art alternative\nmethods in both accuracy and efficiency by a large margin, even with a very\nsmall training set.

For joint understanding of\nregions and expressions, existing REC works typically target on modeling the\ncross-modal relevance in each region-expression pair within each single image.\nIn this paper, we explore a new but general REC-related problem, named\nGroup-based REC, where the regions and expressions can come from different\nsubject-related images (images in the same group), e.g., sets of photo albums\nor video frames. Different from REC, Group-based REC involves differentiated\ncross-modal relevances within each group and across different groups, which,\nhowever, are neglected in the existing one-line paradigm. To this end, we\npropose a novel relevance-guided multi-group self-paced learning schema (termed\nRMSL), where the within-group region-expression pairs are adaptively assigned\nwith different priorities according to their cross-modal relevances, and the\nbias of the group priority is balanced via an across-group relevance constraint\nsimultaneously. In particular, based on the visual and textual semantic\nfeatures, RMSL conducts an adaptive learning cycle upon triplet ranking, where\n(1) the target-negative region-expression pairs with low within-group\nrelevances are used preferentially in model training to distinguish the primary\nsemantics of the target objects, and (2) an across-group relevance\nregularization is integrated into model training to balance the bias of group\npriority.

    "abstract": "Currently, for crowd counting, the fully supervised methods via density map\nestimation are the mainstream research directions. However, such methods need\nlocation-level annotation of persons in an image, which is time-consuming and\nlaborious. Therefore, the weakly supervised method just relying upon the\ncount-level annotation is urgently needed. Since CNN is not suitable for\nmodeling the global context and the interactions between image patches, crowd\ncounting with weakly supervised learning via CNN generally can not show good\nperformance. The weakly supervised model via Transformer was sequentially\nproposed to model the global context and learn contrast features. However, the\ntransformer directly partitions the crowd images into a series of tokens, which\nmay not be a good choice due to each pedestrian being an independent\nindividual, and the parameter number of the network is very large. Hence, we\npropose a Joint CNN and Transformer Network (JCTNet) via weakly supervised\nlearning for crowd counting in this paper. JCTNet consists of three parts: CNN\nfeature extraction module (CFM), Transformer feature extraction module (TFM),\nand counting regression module (CRM). In particular, the CFM extracts crowd\nsemantic information features, then sends their patch partitions to TRM for\nmodeling global context, and CRM is used to predict the number of people.\nExtensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that JCTNet can\neffectively focus on the crowd regions and obtain superior weakly supervised\ncounting performance on five mainstream datasets. The number of parameters of\nthe model can be reduced by about 67%~73% compared with the pure Transformer\nworks. We also tried to explain the phenomenon that a model constrained only by\ncount-level annotations can still focus on the crowd regions.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted for semi-supervised\nlearning on graphs. A recent study shows that the graph random neural network\n(GRAND) model can generate state-of-the-art performance for this problem.\nHowever, it is difficult for GRAND to handle large-scale graphs since its\neffectiveness relies on computationally expensive data augmentation procedures.\nIn this work, we present a scalable and high-performance GNN framework GRAND+\nfor semi-supervised graph learning. To address the above issue, we develop a\ngeneralized forward push (GFPush) algorithm in GRAND+ to pre-compute a general\npropagation matrix and employ it to perform graph data augmentation in a\nmini-batch manner. We show that both the low time and space complexities of\nGFPush enable GRAND+ to efficiently scale to large graphs. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a confidence-aware consistency loss into the model optimization of\nGRAND+, facilitating GRAND+'s generalization superiority. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on seven public datasets of different sizes. The results\ndemonstrate that GRAND+ 1) is able to scale to large graphs and costs less\nrunning time than existing scalable GNNs, and 2) can offer consistent accuracy\nimprovements over both full-batch and scalable GNNs across all datasets.",

Recently,\ngraph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art methods for\nsession-based recommendation. However, we find that there exist two limitations\nin these methods. One is the item transition relations are not fully exploited\nsince the relations are not explicitly modeled. Another is the long-range\ndependencies between items can not be captured effectively due to the\nlimitation of GNNs. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel approach\nfor session-based recommendation, called Transition Relation Aware\nSelf-Attention (TRASA). Specifically, TRASA first converts the session to a\ngraph and then encodes the shortest path between items through the gated\nrecurrent unit as their transition relation. Then, to capture the long-range\ndependencies, TRASA utilizes the self-attention mechanism to build the direct\nconnection between any two items without going through intermediate ones. Also,\nthe transition relations are incorporated explicitly when computing the\nattention scores. Extensive experiments on three real-word datasets demonstrate\nthat TRASA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods consistently.",

Recent work has shown that a continuous representation\nof an image and learning its implicit function enable almost limitless\nupscaling. However, the detailed approach, predicting values (depths) for\nneighbor pixels in the input and then linearly interpolating them, does not\nbest fit the LiDAR range images since it does not fill the unmeasured details\nbut creates a new image with regression in a high-dimensional space.

    "title": "Automatically Distilling Storyboard with Rich Features for Android Apps",
    "abstract": "Before developing a new mobile app, the development team usually endeavors\npainstaking efforts to review many existing apps with similar purposes. The\nreview process is crucial in the sense that it reduces market risks and\nprovides inspirations for app development. However, manual exploration of\nhundreds of existing apps by different roles (e.g., product manager, UI/UX\ndesigner, developer, and tester) can be ineffective.\nFollowing the conception of storyboard in movie production, we propose a\nsystem, named StoryDistiller, to automatically generate the storyboards for\nAndroid apps with rich features through reverse engineering, and assist\ndifferent roles to review and analyze apps effectively and efficiently.\nSpecifically, we (1) propose a hybrid method to extract a relatively complete\nActivity transition graph (ATG), that is, it first extracts the ATG of Android\napps through static analysis method first, and further leverages dynamic\ncomponent exploration to augment ATG; (2) extract the required inter-component\ncommunication (ICC) data of each target Activity by leveraging static data-flow\nanalysis and renders UI pages dynamically by using app instrumentation together\nwith the extracted required ICC data; (3) obtain rich features including\ncomprehensive ATG with rendered UI pages, semantic activity names,\ncorresponding logic and layout code, etc. (4) implement the storyboard\nvisualization as a web service with the rendered UI pages and the corresponding\nrich features. Our experiments unveil that StoryDistiller is effective and\nindeed useful to assist app exploration and review. We also conduct a\ncomprehensive comparison study to demonstrate better performance over IC3,\nGator, Stoat, and StoryDroid.",

    "abstract": "Many video instance segmentation (VIS) methods partition a video sequence\ninto individual frames to detect and segment objects frame by frame. However,\nsuch a frame-in frame-out (FiFo) pipeline is ineffective to exploit the\ntemporal information. Based on the fact that adjacent frames in a short clip\nare highly coherent in content, we propose to extend the one-stage FiFo\nframework to a clip-in clip-out (CiCo) one, which performs VIS clip by clip.\nSpecifically, we stack FPN features of all frames in a short video clip to\nbuild a spatio-temporal feature cube, and replace the 2D conv layers in the\nprediction heads and the mask branch with 3D conv layers, forming clip-level\nprediction heads (CPH) and clip-level mask heads (CMH). Then the clip-level\nmasks of an instance can be generated by feeding its box-level predictions from\nCPH and clip-level features from CMH into a small fully convolutional network.\nA clip-level segmentation loss is proposed to ensure that the generated\ninstance masks are temporally coherent in the clip. The proposed CiCo strategy\nis free of inter-frame alignment, and can be easily embedded into existing FiFo\nbased VIS approaches. To validate the generality and effectiveness of our CiCo\nstrategy, we apply it to two representative FiFo methods, Yolact\n\\cite{bolya2019yolact} and CondInst \\cite{tian2020conditional}, resulting in\ntwo new one-stage VIS models, namely CiCo-Yolact and CiCo-CondInst, which\nachieve 37.1/37.3\\%, 35.2/35.4\\% and 17.2/18.0\\% mask AP using the ResNet50\nbackbone, and 41.8/41.4\\%, 38.0/38.9\\% and 18.0/18.2\\% mask AP using the Swin\nTransformer tiny backbone on YouTube-VIS 2019, 2021 and OVIS valid sets,\nrespectively, recording new state-of-the-arts.

Motivated by this trend, researchers have conducted\nempirical studies by using the inaccessibility issue rate of each page (i.e.,\nscreen level) to represent the characteristics of mobile app accessibility.\nHowever, there still lacks an empirical investigation directly focusing on the\nissues themselves (i.e., issue level) to unveil more fine-grained findings, due\nto the lack of an effective issue detection method and a relatively\ncomprehensive dataset of issues.\nTo fill in this literature gap, we first propose an automated app page\nexploration tool, named Xbot, to facilitate app accessibility testing and\nautomatically collect accessibility issues by leveraging the instrumentation\ntechnique and static program analysis. Owing to the relatively high activity\ncoverage (around 80%) achieved by Xbot when exploring apps, Xbot achieves\nbetter performance on accessibility issue collection than existing testing\ntools such as Google Monkey. With Xbot, we are able to collect a relatively\ncomprehensive accessibility issue dataset and finally collect 86,767 issues\nfrom 2,270 unique apps including both closed-source and open-source apps, based\non which we further carry out an empirical study from the perspective of\naccessibility issues themselves to investigate novel characteristics of\naccessibility issues. Specifically, we extensively investigate these issues by\nchecking 1) the overall severity of issues with multiple criteria, 2) the\nin-depth relation between issue types and app categories, GUI component types,\n3) the frequent issue patterns quantitatively, and 4) the fixing status of\naccessibility issues.",

To enable bidirectional information\nflow between saliency and depth branches, a novel multi-task feature fusion\n(MFF) module is integrated into our DFTR.

Although existing methods achieve satisfying\nperformance, they are mostly based on CNN and specialized for a single domain\nsay associated with a particular anatomical region. In this work, we propose a\nuniversal model for multi-domain landmark detection by taking advantage of\ntransformer for modeling long dependencies and develop a domain-adaptive\ntransformer model, named as DATR, which is trained on multiple mixed datasets\nfrom different anatomies and capable of detecting landmarks of any image from\nthose anatomies. The proposed DATR exhibits three primary features: (i) It is\nthe first universal model which introduces transformer as an encoder for\nmulti-anatomy landmark detection; (ii) We design a domain-adaptive transformer\nfor anatomy-aware landmark detection, which can be effectively extended to any\nother transformer network; (iii) Following previous studies, we employ a\nlight-weighted guidance network, which encourages the transformer network to\ndetect more accurate landmarks. We carry out experiments on three widely used\nX-ray datasets for landmark detection, which have 1,588 images and 62 landmarks\nin total, including three different anatomies (head, hand, and chest).\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed DATR achieves\nstate-of-the-art performances by most metrics and behaves much better than any\nprevious convolution-based models.

In this paper, we\npropose Graph Mechanics Network (GMN) which is combinatorially efficient,\nequivariant and constraint-aware. The core of GMN is that it represents, by\ngeneralized coordinates, the forward kinematics information (positions and\nvelocities) of a structural object. In this manner, the geometrical constraints\nare implicitly and naturally encoded in the forward kinematics. Moreover, to\nallow equivariant message passing in GMN, we have developed a general form of\northogonality-equivariant functions, given that the dynamics of constrained\nsystems are more complicated than the unconstrained counterparts.\nTheoretically, the proposed equivariant formulation is proved to be universally\nexpressive under certain conditions.

    "abstract": "Rolling shutter (RS) distortion can be interpreted as the result of picking a\nrow of pixels from instant global shutter (GS) frames over time during the\nexposure of the RS camera. This means that the information of each instant GS\nframe is partially, yet sequentially, embedded into the row-dependent\ndistortion. Inspired by this fact, we address the challenging task of reversing\nthis process, i.e., extracting undistorted GS frames from images suffering from\nRS distortion. However, since RS distortion is coupled with other factors such\nas readout settings and the relative velocity of scene elements to the camera,\nmodels that only exploit the geometric correlation between temporally adjacent\nimages suffer from poor generality in processing data with different readout\nsettings and dynamic scenes with both camera motion and object motion. In this\npaper, instead of two consecutive frames, we propose to exploit a pair of\nimages captured by dual RS cameras with reversed RS directions for this highly\nchallenging task. Grounded on the symmetric and complementary nature of dual\nreversed distortion, we develop a novel end-to-end model, IFED, to generate\ndual optical flow sequence through iterative learning of the velocity field\nduring the RS time. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IFED is\nsuperior to naive cascade schemes, as well as the state-of-the-art which\nutilizes adjacent RS images. Most importantly, although it is trained on a\nsynthetic dataset, IFED is shown to be effective at retrieving GS frame\nsequences from real-world RS distorted images of dynamic scenes.",

Based on this\ntechnique we present two models for discrete and continuous prediction in\nspace. We demonstrate the performance using two high-dimensional fluid problems\nof Burgers' equation and Flow Past Cylinder for discrete model and using Allen\nCahn equation and Convection-diffusion equations for continuous model. We show\nthe models are also robust to noise in measurements.",

To broaden the 3D applicability from 3D-aware image\ngeneration to 3D-controllable object generation, we propose the factorized\nrepresentations which are view-independent and light-disentangled, and training\nschemes with randomly sampled light conditions.

In addition, we show that our approach improves the\nquality of the generated geometry via visualization and quantitative\ncomparison.

    "abstract": "Echocardiography is widely used to clinical practice for diagnosis and\ntreatment, e.g., on the common congenital heart defects. The traditional manual\nmanipulation is error-prone due to the staff shortage, excess workload, and\nless experience, leading to the urgent requirement of an automated\ncomputer-aided reporting system to lighten the workload of ultrasonologists\nconsiderably and assist them in decision making. Despite some recent successful\nattempts in automatical medical report generation, they are trapped in the\nultrasound report generation, which involves unstructured-view images and\ntopic-related descriptions. To this end, we investigate the task of the\nunstructured-view topic-related ultrasound report generation, and propose a\nnovel factored attention and embedding model (termed FAE-Gen). The proposed\nFAE-Gen mainly consists of two modules, i.e., view-guided factored attention\nand topic-oriented factored embedding, which 1) capture the homogeneous and\nheterogeneous morphological characteristic across different views, and 2)\ngenerate the descriptions with different syntactic patterns and different\nemphatic contents for different topics.

    "abstract": "The jigsaw puzzle problem (JPP) is a well-known research problem, which has\nbeen studied for many years. Solving this problem typically involves a\ntwo-stage scheme, consisting of the computation of a pairwise piece\ncompatibility measure (CM), coupled with a subsequent puzzle reconstruction\nalgorithm. Many effective CMs, which apply a simple distance measure, based\nmerely on the information along the piece edges, have been proposed. However,\nthe practicality of these classical methods is rather doubtful for problem\ninstances harder than pure synthetic images. Specifically, these methods tend\nto break down in more realistic scenarios involving, e.g., monochromatic\npuzzles, eroded boundaries due to piece degradation over long time periods,\nmissing pieces, etc. To overcome this significant deficiency, a few deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN)-based CMs have been recently introduced.\nDespite their promising accuracy, these models are very computationally\nintensive. Twin Embedding Networks (TEN), to represent a piece with respect to\nits boundary in a latent embedding space. Combining this latent representation\nwith a simple distance measure, we then demonstrate a superior performance, in\nterms of accuracy, of our newly proposed pairwise CM, compared to that of\nvarious classical methods, for the problem domain of eroded tile boundaries, a\ntestbed for a number of real-world JPP variants. Furthermore, we also\ndemonstrate that TEN is faster by a few orders of magnitude, on average, than\nthe recent NN models, i.e., it is as fast as the classical methods. In this\nregard, the paper makes a significant first attempt at bridging the gap between\nthe relatively low accuracy (of classical methods) and the intensive\ncomputational complexity (of NN models), for practical, real-world puzzle-like\nproblems.",

    "abstract": "Joint source channel coding (JSCC) has attracted increasing attentions due to\nits robustness and high efficiency. However, the existing research on JSCC\nmainly focuses on minimizing the distortion between the transmitted and\nreceived information, while limiting the required data rate. Therefore, even\nthough the transmitted information is well recovered, the transmitted bits may\nbe far more than the minimal threshold according to the rate-distortion (RD)\ntheory. In this paper, we propose an adaptive Information Bottleneck (IB)\nguided JSCC (AIB-JSCC), which aims at achieving the theoretically maximal\ncompression ratio for a given reconstruction quality. In particular, we first\nderive a mathematically tractable form of loss function for AIB-JSCC. To keep a\nbetter tradeoff between compression and reconstruction quality, we further\npropose an adaptive algorithm that adjusts hyperparameter beta of the proposed\nloss function dynamically according to the distortion during training.\nExperiment results show that AIB-JSCC can significantly reduce the required\namount of the transmitted data and improve the reconstruction quality and\ndownstream artificial-intelligent task performance.",

    "abstract": "Recent concerns that machine learning (ML) may be facing a reproducibility\nand replication crisis suggest that some published claims in ML research cannot\nbe taken at face value. These concerns inspire analogies to the replication\ncrisis affecting the social and medical sciences, as well as calls for greater\nintegration of statistical approaches to causal inference and predictive\nmodeling. A deeper understanding of what reproducibility concerns in research\nin supervised ML have in common with the replication crisis in experimental\nscience can put the new concerns in perspective, and help researchers avoid\n\"the worst of both worlds\" that can emerge when ML researchers begin borrowing\nmethodologies from explanatory modeling without understanding their\nlimitations, and vice versa. We contribute a comparative analysis of concerns\nabout inductive learning that arise in different stages of the modeling\npipeline in causal attribution as exemplified in psychology versus predictive\nmodeling as exemplified by ML. We identify themes that re-occur in reform\ndiscussions like overreliance on asymptotic theory and non-credible beliefs\nabout real-world data generating processes. We argue that in both fields,\nclaims from learning are implied to generalize outside the specific environment\nstudied (e.g., the input dataset or subject sample, modeling implementation,\netc.) but are often impossible to refute due to forms of underspecification. In\nparticular, many errors being acknowledged in ML expose cracks in long-held\nbeliefs that optimizing predictive accuracy using huge datasets absolves one\nfrom having to make assumptions about the underlying data generating process.\nWe conclude by discussing rhetorical risks like error misdiagnosis that arise\nin times of methodological uncertainty.",

Understanding the\njob arrival rate is crucial for accurately predicting future changes in cloud\nworkloads and proactively provisioning and de-provisioning VMs for hosting the\napplications. However, developing a model that accurately predicts cloud\nworkload changes is extremely challenging due to the dynamic nature of cloud\nworkloads. Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) models have been developed for cloud\nworkload prediction. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art LSTM model leverages\nrecurrences to predict, which naturally adds complexity and increases the\ninference overhead as input sequences grow longer.

Vulnerabilities of such libraries result in irreparable\nconsequences. However, the characteristics of software security vulnerabilities\nhave not been well studied. In this paper, to bridge this gap, we take the\nfirst step towards characterizing and understanding the security\nvulnerabilities of five well-known ML libraries, including Tensorflow, PyTorch,\nSickit-learn, Pandas, and Numpy. To do so, in total, we collected 596\nsecurity-related commits to exploring five major factors: 1) vulnerability\ntypes, 2) root causes, 3) symptoms, 4) fixing patterns, and 5) fixing efforts\nof security vulnerabilities in ML libraries.

Despite their phenomenal performance in a wide\nvariety of applications, deep neural networks are prone to forgetting their\npreviously learned information upon learning new ones. This phenomenon is\ncalled \"catastrophic forgetting\" and is deeply rooted in the\nstability-plasticity dilemma. Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in deep neural\nnetworks has become an active field of research in recent years. In particular,\ngradient projection-based methods have recently shown exceptional performance\nat overcoming catastrophic forgetting. This paper proposes two\nbiologically-inspired mechanisms based on sparsity and heterogeneous dropout\nthat significantly increase a continual learner's performance over a long\nsequence of tasks. Our proposed approach builds on the Gradient Projection\nMemory (GPM) framework. We leverage K-winner activations in each layer of a\nneural network to enforce layer-wise sparse activations for each task, together\nwith a between-task heterogeneous dropout that encourages the network to use\nnon-overlapping activation patterns between different tasks. In addition, we\nintroduce Continual Swiss Roll as a lightweight and interpretable -- yet\nchallenging -- synthetic benchmark for continual learning. Lastly, we provide\nan in-depth analysis of our proposed method and demonstrate a significant\nperformance boost on various benchmark continual learning problems.",

    "abstract": "While gerrymandering has been widely suspected in Georgia for years, it has\nbeen difficult to quantify. Using historic voting data, we compare the Georgia\ncongressional redistricting plan enacted in 2021 with a large collection of\nrandomly generated non-partisan maps. We find that the 2021 plan will likely be\nhighly non-responsive to changing opinions of the electorate. The enacted map\nis structured so that it will reliably elect nine Republicans and five\nDemocrats over a wide range of studied voting patterns. In contrast, for the\nnon-partisan maps in our ensemble, only 0.12% of the plans behave similarly to\nthe enacted plan over the seventeen elections considered between 2016-2020. We\nfind the major cause of the non-responsive nature of the 2021 map is that it\npolarizes voters across the more competitive districts. Specifically, there are\nfive districts that would be significantly more competitive under maps with our\nnon-partisan considerations but have been shifted to become more Republican;\nsimilarly, there are three districts that have more Democratic voters than is\ntypical.\nUtilizing a combination of our ensemble statistics and spatial analysis, we\nfind evidence that the heavily Democratic 4th, 5th and 13th Congressional\nDistricts and the heavily Republican 9th District contain an unrepresentatively\nlarge number of Democrats. The consolidation or packing of Democratic voters in\nthe 4th, 5th, and 13th Districts creates significant numbers of wasted votes\nand dilutes their voting power. Furthermore, based on comparisons with the\npreviously enacted 2011 map and the ensemble of plans, we find that a\nsignificant number of Democratic voters have been added to the solidly\nRepublican 9th District, replacing Republican voters who have been moved to the\n6th and 10th Districts. This redrawing substantially weakens, or cracks, the\npotential influence of Democratic votes in these districts.",

    "abstract": "The automotive mmWave radar plays a key role in advanced driver assistance\nsystems (ADAS) and autonomous driving. Deep learning-based instance\nsegmentation enables real-time object identification from the radar detection\npoints. In the conventional training process, accurate annotation is the key.\nHowever, high-quality annotations of radar detection points are challenging to\nachieve due to their ambiguity and sparsity. To address this issue, we propose\na contrastive learning approach for implementing radar detection points-based\ninstance segmentation. We define the positive and negative samples according to\nthe ground-truth label, apply the contrastive loss to train the model first,\nand then perform training for the following downstream task. In addition, these\ntwo steps can be merged into one, and pseudo labels can be generated for the\nunlabeled data to improve the performance further. Thus, there are four\ndifferent training settings for our method. Experiments show that when the\nground-truth information is only available for 5% of the training data, our\nmethod still achieves a comparable performance to the approach trained in a\nsupervised manner with 100% ground-truth information.",

    "abstract": "In a model inversion attack, an adversary attempts to reconstruct the data\nrecords, used to train a target model, using only the model's output. In\nlaunching a contemporary model inversion attack, the strategies discussed are\ngenerally based on either predicted confidence score vectors, i.e., black-box\nattacks, or the parameters of a target model, i.e., white-box attacks. However,\nin the real world, model owners usually only give out the predicted labels; the\nconfidence score vectors and model parameters are hidden as a defense mechanism\nto prevent such attacks. Unfortunately, we have found a model inversion method\nthat can reconstruct the input data records based only on the output labels. We\nbelieve this is the attack that requires the least information to succeed and,\ntherefore, has the best applicability. The key idea is to exploit the error\nrate of the target model to compute the median distance from a set of data\nrecords to the decision boundary of the target model. The distance, then, is\nused to generate confidence score vectors which are adopted to train an attack\nmodel to reconstruct the data records. The experimental results show that\nhighly recognizable data records can be reconstructed with far less information\nthan existing methods.",

Although it has been extensively\nstudied within the context of mesh-based numerical techniques, such as the\nfinite element method (FEM), the research activity within the Smoothed Particle\nHydrodynamics (SPH) community remains scarce. SPH is a particle based method,\nideal to simulate fracture scenarios that involve extreme deformations.\nHowever, to model fracture, SPH researchers have mostly relied on ad-hoc\nempirical local damage models, cohesive zone approaches, or pseudo-spring\nmodels, which come with a set of drawbacks and limitations. On the other hand,\nphase field models of brittle fracture have recently gained popularity in\nacademic circles and provide significant improvements compared to previous\napproaches. These improvements include the derivation from fundamental fracture\ntheories, the introduction of non-locality, and the ability to model multiple\ncrack initiation, propagation, branching, and coalescence, in situations where\nno prior knowledge of the crack paths is available. Nevertheless, phase field\nmodeling has not been combined with SPH for fracture simulations. In this\nproof-of-concept paper we develop and implement a phase field model of brittle\nfracture within the context of SPH.

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks have been extensively studied in recent years since they\ncan identify the vulnerability of deep learning models before deployed. In this\npaper, we consider the black-box adversarial setting, where the adversary needs\nto craft adversarial examples without access to the gradients of a target\nmodel. Previous methods attempted to approximate the true gradient either by\nusing the transfer gradient of a surrogate white-box model or based on the\nfeedback of model queries. However, the existing methods inevitably suffer from\nlow attack success rates or poor query efficiency since it is difficult to\nestimate the gradient in a high-dimensional input space with limited\ninformation. To address these problems and improve black-box attacks, we\npropose two prior-guided random gradient-free (PRGF) algorithms based on biased\nsampling and gradient averaging, respectively. Our methods can take the\nadvantage of a transfer-based prior given by the gradient of a surrogate model\nand the query information simultaneously. Through theoretical analyses, the\ntransfer-based prior is appropriately integrated with model queries by an\noptimal coefficient in each method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in\ncomparison with the alternative state-of-the-arts, both of our methods require\nmuch fewer queries to attack black-box models with higher success rates.",

This study establishes a methodological\nframework to quantify the extent, timing, and spatial variation of hurricane\npreparedness at the CBG level using high-resolution location intelligence data.\nAnonymized cell phone data on visits to POIs for each CBG before 2017 Hurricane\nHarvey were used to examine hurricane preparedness. Four categories of POI,\ngrocery stores, gas stations, pharmacies and home improvement stores, were\nidentified as having close relationship with hurricane preparedness, and the\ndaily number of visits from each CBG to these four categories of POIs were\ncalculated during preparation period. Two metrics, extent of preparedness and\nproactivity, were calculated based on the daily visit percentage change\ncompared to the baseline period. The results show that peak visits to\npharmacies often occurred in the early stage, whereas the peak of visits to gas\nstations happened closer to landfall. The spatial and temporal patterns of\nvisits to grocery stores and home improvement stores were quite similar.\nHowever, correlation analysis demonstrates that extent of preparedness and\nproactivity are independent of each other. Combined with synchronous evacuation\ndata, CBGs were divided into four clusters in terms of extent of preparedness\nand evacuation rate. The clusters with low preparedness and low evacuation rate\nwere identified as hotspots of vulnerability for shelter-in-place households\nthat would need urgent attention during response.

    "abstract": "Transfer learning is an important approach that produces pre-trained teacher\nmodels which can be used to quickly build specialized student models. However,\nrecent research on transfer learning has found that it is vulnerable to various\nattacks, e.g., misclassification and backdoor attacks. However, it is still not\nclear whether transfer learning is vulnerable to model inversion attacks.\nLaunching a model inversion attack against transfer learning scheme is\nchallenging. Not only does the student model hide its structural parameters,\nbut it is also inaccessible to the adversary. Hence, when targeting a student\nmodel, both the white-box and black-box versions of existing model inversion\nattacks fail. White-box attacks fail as they need the target model's\nparameters. Black-box attacks fail as they depend on making repeated queries of\nthe target model. However, they may not mean that transfer learning models are\nimpervious to model inversion attacks. Hence, with this paper, we initiate\nresearch into model inversion attacks against transfer learning schemes with\ntwo novel attack methods. Both are black-box attacks, suiting different\nsituations, that do not rely on queries to the target student model. In the\nfirst method, the adversary has the data samples that share the same\ndistribution as the training set of the teacher model. In the second method,\nthe adversary does not have any such samples. Experiments show that highly\nrecognizable data records can be recovered with both of these methods. This\nmeans that even if a model is an inaccessible black-box, it can still be\ninverted.",

We empirically show that a high average accuracy not\nnecessarily means a high worst-case accuracy.

In turn, we devise two strategies from the\nbias-variance tradeoff perspective to implicitly reach this goal: a simple yet\neffective stability regularization (SR) loss together with model ensemble to\nreduce variance during fine-tuning, and an adaptability calibration mechanism\nto reduce the bias. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed strategies, which outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art methods with a significant margin in terms of not only\naverage, but also worst-case accuracy.",

    "title": "CVFNet: Real-time 3D Object Detection by Learning Cross View Features",
    "abstract": "In recent years 3D object detection from LiDAR point clouds has made great\nprogress thanks to the development of deep learning technologies. Although\nvoxel or point based methods are popular in 3D object detection, they usually\ninvolve time-consuming operations such as 3D convolutions on voxels or ball\nquery among points, making the resulting network inappropriate for time\ncritical applications. On the other hand, 2D view-based methods feature high\ncomputing efficiency while usually obtaining inferior performance than the\nvoxel or point based methods. In this work, we present a real-time view-based\nsingle stage 3D object detector, namely CVFNet to fulfill this task. To\nstrengthen the cross-view feature learning under the condition of demanding\nefficiency, our framework extracts the features of different views and fuses\nthem in an efficient progressive way. We first propose a novel Point-Range\nfeature fusion module that deeply integrates point and range view features in\nmultiple stages. Then, a special Slice Pillar is designed to well maintain the\n3D geometry when transforming the obtained deep point-view features into bird's\neye view. To better balance the ratio of samples, a sparse pillar detection\nhead is presented to focus the detection on the nonempty grids. We conduct\nexperiments on the popular KITTI and NuScenes benchmark, and state-of-the-art\nperformances are achieved in terms of both accuracy and speed.",

    "abstract": "In high-stake scenarios like medical treatment and auto-piloting, it's risky\nor even infeasible to collect online experimental data to train the agent.\nSimulation-based training can alleviate this issue, but may suffer from its\ninherent mismatches from the simulator and real environment. It is therefore\nimperative to utilize the simulator to learn a robust policy for the real-world\ndeployment. In this work, we consider policy learning for Robust Markov\nDecision Processes (RMDP), where the agent tries to seek a robust policy with\nrespect to unexpected perturbations on the environments. Specifically, we focus\non the setting where the training environment can be characterized as a\ngenerative model and a constrained perturbation can be added to the model\nduring testing. Our goal is to identify a near-optimal robust policy for the\nperturbed testing environment, which introduces additional technical\ndifficulties as we need to simultaneously estimate the training environment\nuncertainty from samples and find the worst-case perturbation for testing. To\nsolve this issue, we propose a generic method which formalizes the perturbation\nas an opponent to obtain a two-player zero-sum game, and further show that the\nNash Equilibrium corresponds to the robust policy. We prove that, with a\npolynomial number of samples from the generative model, our algorithm can find\na near-optimal robust policy with a high probability. Our method is able to\ndeal with general perturbations under some mild assumptions and can also be\nextended to more complex problems like robust partial observable Markov\ndecision process, thanks to the game-theoretical formulation.",

    "abstract": "Recently, generative steganography that transforms secret information to a\ngenerated image has been a promising technique to resist steganalysis\ndetection. However, due to the inefficiency and irreversibility of the\nsecret-to-image transformation, it is hard to find a good trade-off between the\ninformation hiding capacity and extraction accuracy. To address this issue, we\npropose a secret-to-image reversible transformation (S2IRT) scheme for\ngenerative steganography. The proposed S2IRT scheme is based on a generative\nmodel, i.e., Glow model, which enables a bijective-mapping between latent space\nwith multivariate Gaussian distribution and image space with a complex\ndistribution. In the process of S2I transformation, guided by a given secret\nmessage, we construct a latent vector and then map it to a generated image by\nthe Glow model, so that the secret message is finally transformed to the\ngenerated image. Owing to good efficiency and reversibility of S2IRT scheme,\nthe proposed steganographic approach achieves both high hiding capacity and\naccurate extraction of secret message from generated image. Furthermore, a\nseparate encoding-based S2IRT (SE-S2IRT) scheme is also proposed to improve the\nrobustness to common image attacks. The experiments demonstrate the proposed\nsteganographic approaches can achieve high hiding capacity (up to 4 bpp) and\naccurate information extraction (almost 100% accuracy rate) simultaneously,\nwhile maintaining desirable anti-detectability and imperceptibility.",

Nevertheless, dense 3D geometry annotations are\nprohibitively costly for videos and are typically not available for this video\ngeneration task. In this paper, we first introduce a self-supervised geometry\nlearning method to automatically recover the dense 3D geometry (i.e.depth) from\nthe face videos without the requirement of any expensive 3D annotation data.\nBased on the learned dense depth maps, we further propose to leverage them to\nestimate sparse facial keypoints that capture the critical movement of the\nhuman head. In a more dense way, the depth is also utilized to learn 3D-aware\ncross-modal (i.e. appearance and depth) attention to guide the generation of\nmotion fields for warping source image representations.

To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a deep\nlearning (DL) scheme to improve the 1-bit compressed sensing-based superimposed\nCSI feedback. On the user side, the downlink CSI is compressed with the 1-bit\nCS technique, superimposed on the uplink user data sequences (UL-US), and then\nsent back to the base station (BS). At the BS, based on the model-driven\napproach and assisted by the superimposition-interference cancellation\ntechnology, a multi-task detection network is first constructed for detecting\nboth the UL-US and downlink CSI.

We evaluate ALDI++\nagainst a statistical threshold, variational auto-encoder, and the original\nALDI as baselines in classifying discords and energy forecasting scenarios. Our\nresults demonstrate that while the classification performance improvement over\nthe original method is marginal, ALDI++ helps achieve the best forecasting\nerror improving 6% over the winning's team approach with six times less\ncomputation time.",

In this paper,\nwe explore the impact of adaptive bit rates on semantic coding (SC) under\nvarious channel conditions. First, we propose two progressive semantic hybrid\nautomatic repeat request (HARQ) schemes, both of which exploit the incremental\nknowledge (IK) obtained from the retransmission, to further reduce the semantic\nerror in the transmission process. We then design a novel semantic encoding\nsolution with multi-bit rate selection. In this solution, the transmitter\nemploys a policy network to decide the appropriate coding rate, so as to ensure\nthe correct information delivery at the cost of minimal bits. Besides, we\ndesign two specific denoisers to reduce the semantic errors encountered in the\ntransmission process according to the semantic characteristics of context and\nSNR. Finally, a novel end-to-end semantic communication framework is proposed\nby effectively combining the aforementioned methods.

    "abstract": "In this work, we revisit the semi-supervised learning (SSL) problem from a\nnew perspective of explicitly reducing empirical distribution mismatch between\nlabeled and unlabeled samples. Benefited from this new perspective, we first\npropose a new deep semi-supervised learning framework called Semi-supervised\nLearning by Empirical Distribution Alignment (SLEDA), in which existing\ntechnologies from the domain adaptation community can be readily used to\naddress the semi-supervised learning problem through reducing the empirical\ndistribution distance between labeled and unlabeled data. Based on this\nframework, we also develop a new theoretical generalization bound for the\nresearch community to better understand the semi-supervised learning problem,\nin which we show the generalization error of semi-supervised learning can be\neffectively bounded by minimizing the training error on labeled data and the\nempirical distribution distance between labeled and unlabeled data. Building\nupon our new framework and the theoretical bound, we develop a simple and\neffective deep semi-supervised learning method called Augmented Distribution\nAlignment Network (ADA-Net) by simultaneously adopting the well-established\nadversarial training strategy from the domain adaptation community and a simple\nsample interpolation strategy for data augmentation. Additionally, we\nincorporate both strategies in our ADA-Net into two exiting SSL methods to\nfurther improve their generalization capability, which indicates that our new\nframework provides a complementary solution for solving the SSL problem. Our\ncomprehensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets SVHN and CIFAR-10\nfor the semi-supervised image recognition task and another two benchmark\ndatasets ModelNet40 and ShapeNet55 for the semi-supervised point cloud\nrecognition task demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework for\nSSL.",

It has opened up meeting an extensive\nlist of real life applications such as measuring air pollution level, road\ntraffic information, and so on. In literature this is known as \\emph{mobile\ncrowdsourcing} or \\emph{mobile crowdsensing}. In this paper, the discussed\nset-up consists of multiple task requesters (or task providers) and multiple\nIoT devices (as \\emph{task executors}), where each of the task providers is\nhaving multiple homogeneous sensing tasks. Each of the task requesters report\nbid along with the number of homogeneous sensing tasks to the platform. On the\nother side, we have multiple IoT devices that reports the \\emph{ask} (charge\nfor imparting its services) and the number of sensing tasks that it can\nexecute. The valuations of task requesters and IoT devices are \\emph{private}\ninformation, and both might act \\emph{strategically}. One assumption that is\nmade in this paper is that the bids and asks of the agents (\\emph{task\nproviders} and \\emph{IoT devices}) follow \\emph{decreasing marginal returns}\ncriteria. In this paper, a truthful mechanism is proposed for allocating the\nIoT devices to the sensing tasks carried by task requesters, that also keeps\ninto account the quality of IoT devices.

    "abstract": "Recently, automatic video captioning has attracted increasing attention,\nwhere the core challenge lies in capturing the key semantic items, like objects\nand actions as well as their spatial-temporal correlations from the redundant\nframes and semantic content. To this end, existing works select either the key\nvideo clips in a global level~(across multi frames), or key regions within each\nframe, which, however, neglect the hierarchical order, i.e., key frames first\nand key regions latter. In this paper, we propose a novel joint-hierarchical\nattention model for video captioning, which embeds the key clips, the key\nframes and the key regions jointly into the captioning model in a hierarchical\nmanner. Such a joint-hierarchical attention model first conducts a global\nselection to identify key frames, followed by a Gumbel sampling operation to\nidentify further key regions based on the key frames, achieving an accurate\nglobal-to-local feature representation to guide the captioning.

Existing methods\ntend to formulate the TAGV task with a visual span-based question answering\n(QA) approach by matching the visual frame span queried by the text question.\nHowever, due to the weak correlations and huge gaps in semantics in features\nbetween the textual question and visual answer, existing methods adopting\nvisual span predictor fail to perform well in the TAGV task.

Specifically, the context query attention is utilized to\nperform cross-modal modeling between the textual and visual features.

    "abstract": "Training deep neural networks (DNNs) is a computationally expensive job,\nwhich can take weeks or months even with high performance GPUs. As a remedy for\nthis challenge, community has started exploring the use of more efficient data\nrepresentations in the training process, e.g., block floating point (BFP).\nHowever, prior work on BFP-based DNN accelerators rely on a specific BFP\nrepresentation making them less versatile. This paper builds upon an\nalgorithmic observation that we can accelerate the training by leveraging\nmultiple BFP precisions without compromising the finally achieved accuracy.\nBacked up by this algorithmic opportunity, we develop a flexible DNN training\naccelerator, dubbed FlexBlock, which supports three different BFP precision\nmodes, possibly different among activation, weight, and gradient tensors. While\nseveral prior works proposed such multi-precision support for DNN accelerators,\nnot only do they focus only on the inference, but also their core utilization\nis suboptimal at a fixed precision and specific layer types when the training\nis considered. Instead, FlexBlock is designed in such a way that high core\nutilization is achievable for i) various layer types, and ii) three BFP\nprecisions by mapping data in a hierarchical manner to its compute units. We\nevaluate the effectiveness of FlexBlock architecture using well-known DNNs on\nCIFAR, ImageNet and WMT14 datasets. As a result, training in FlexBlock\nsignificantly improves the training speed by 1.5~5.3x and the energy efficiency\nby 2.4~7.0x on average compared to other training accelerators and incurs\nmarginal accuracy loss compared to full-precision training.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in image segmentation is classifying object boundaries.\nRecent efforts propose to refine the segmentation result with boundary masks.\nHowever, models are still prone to misclassifying boundary pixels even when\nthey correctly capture the object contours. In such cases, even a perfect\nboundary map is unhelpful for segmentation refinement. In this paper, we argue\nthat assigning proper prior weights to error-prone pixels such as object\nboundaries can significantly improve the segmentation quality. Specifically, we\npresent the \\textit{pixel null model} (PNM), a prior model that weights each\npixel according to its probability of being correctly classified by a random\nsegmenter. Empirical analysis shows that PNM captures the misclassification\ndistribution of different state-of-the-art (SOTA) segmenters. Extensive\nexperiments on semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation tasks over three\ndatasets (Cityscapes, ADE20K, MS COCO) confirm that PNM consistently improves\nthe segmentation quality of most SOTA methods (including the vision\ntransformers) and outperforms boundary-based methods by a large margin. We also\nobserve that the widely-used mean IoU (mIoU) metric is insensitive to\nboundaries of different sharpness.

The basic idea\nwas to provide more electrical assistance to cyclists in areas of high air\npollution to reduce the cyclist ventilation rate and thereby the amount of air\npollutants inhaled. This presents an interesting control challenge due to the\nhuman-in-the-loop characteristics and the potential for impactful real life\napplications.

    "abstract": "Along with the proliferation of digital data collected using sensor\ntechnologies and a boost of computing power, Deep Learning (DL) based\napproaches have drawn enormous attention in the past decade due to their\nimpressive performance in extracting complex relations from raw data and\nrepresenting valuable information. Meanwhile, though, rooted in its notorious\nblack-box nature, the appreciation of DL has been highly debated due to the\nlack of interpretability. On the one hand, DL only utilizes statistical\nfeatures contained in raw data while ignoring human knowledge of the underlying\nsystem, which results in both data inefficiency and trust issues; on the other\nhand, a trained DL model does not provide to researchers any extra insight\nabout the underlying system beyond its output, which, however, is the essence\nof most fields of science, e.g. physics and economics.\nThis thesis addresses the issue of interpretability in general information\nmodeling and endeavors to ease the problem from two scopes. Firstly, a\nproblem-oriented perspective is applied to incorporate knowledge into modeling\npractice, where interesting mathematical properties emerge naturally which cast\nconstraints on modeling. Secondly, given a trained model, various methods could\nbe applied to extract further insights about the underlying system. These two\npathways are termed as guided model design and secondary measurements.\nRemarkably, a novel scheme emerges for the modeling practice in statistical\nlearning: Algebraic Learning (AgLr). Instead of being restricted to the\ndiscussion of any specific model, AgLr starts from idiosyncrasies of a learning\ntask itself and studies the structure of a legitimate model class. This novel\nscheme demonstrates the noteworthy value of abstract algebra for general AI,\nwhich has been overlooked in recent progress, and could shed further light on\ninterpretable information modeling.",

    "abstract": "The last seventy years have witnessed the transition of communication from\nShannon's theoretical concept to current high-efficient practical systems.\nClassical communication systems address the capability-deficiency issue mainly\nby module-stacking and technique-densification with ever-increasing complexity.\nIn such a traditional viewpoint, classical source coding only uses explicit\nprobabilistic models to compress data, which ignores the meaning of transmitted\nsource messages. Also, the channel coding and transmission does not identify\nthe source content. In this sense, state-of-the-art communication systems work\nmerely at the technical level as summarized by Weaver. Unlike the traditional\nsystem design philosophy, this article proposes a new route to boost the system\ncapabilities towards intelligence-endogenous and primitive-concise\ncommunications. The communication paradigm upgrades to the semantic level,\nwhich is radically different since all the key techniques imply the use of\nmeanings of transmitted data, thus deeply changing the design of the\ncommunication system. This paradigm shifting unveils a promising direction due\nto its ability to offer the identical quality of service with much lower data\ntransmission requirement. Different from other similar works, this article\nconstitutes a brief tutorial on the framework of semantic communications, its\ngain analyzed from the information theory perspective, a method to calculate\nthe semantic compression bound, and an exemplary use case of semantic\ncommunications.",

    "abstract": "Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are an essential defense for\ncomputer networks and the hosts within them. Machine learning (ML) nowadays\npredominantly serves as the basis for NIDS decision making, where models are\ntuned to reduce false alarms, increase detection rates, and detect known and\nunknown attacks. At the same time, ML models have been found to be vulnerable\nto adversarial examples that undermine the downstream task. In this work, we\nask the practical question of whether real-world ML-based NIDS can be\ncircumvented by crafted adversarial flows, and if so, how can they be created.\nWe develop the generative adversarial network (GAN)-based attack algorithm\nNIDSGAN and evaluate its effectiveness against realistic ML-based NIDS. Two\nmain challenges arise for generating adversarial network traffic flows: (1) the\nnetwork features must obey the constraints of the domain (i.e., represent\nrealistic network behavior), and (2) the adversary must learn the decision\nbehavior of the target NIDS without knowing its model internals (e.g.,\narchitecture and meta-parameters) and training data. Despite these challenges,\nthe NIDSGAN algorithm generates highly realistic adversarial traffic flows that\nevade ML-based NIDS. We evaluate our attack algorithm against two\nstate-of-the-art DNN-based NIDS in whitebox, blackbox, and restricted-blackbox\nthreat models and achieve success rates which are on average 99%, 85%, and 70%,\nrespectively. We also show that our attack algorithm can evade NIDS based on\nclassical ML models including logistic regression, SVM, decision trees and\nKNNs, with a success rate of 70% on average. Our results demonstrate that\ndeploying ML-based NIDS without careful defensive strategies against\nadversarial flows may (and arguably likely will) lead to future compromises.",

    "abstract": "Recently, transformer-based methods have demonstrated impressive results in\nvarious vision tasks, including image super-resolution (SR), by exploiting the\nself-attention (SA) for feature extraction. However, the computation of SA in\nmost existing transformer based models is very expensive, while some employed\noperations may be redundant for the SR task. This limits the range of SA\ncomputation and consequently the SR performance. In this work, we propose an\nefficient long-range attention network (ELAN) for image SR. Specifically, we\nfirst employ shift convolution (shift-conv) to effectively extract the image\nlocal structural information while maintaining the same level of complexity as\n1x1 convolution, then propose a group-wise multi-scale self-attention (GMSA)\nmodule, which calculates SA on non-overlapped groups of features using\ndifferent window sizes to exploit the long-range image dependency. A highly\nefficient long-range attention block (ELAB) is then built by simply cascading\ntwo shift-conv with a GMSA module, which is further accelerated by using a\nshared attention mechanism. Without bells and whistles, our ELAN follows a\nfairly simple design by sequentially cascading the ELABs. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that ELAN obtains even better results against the transformer-based\nSR models but with significantly less complexity.

    "abstract": "In this paper we revisit large kernel design in modern convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs), which is often neglected in the past few years. Inspired by\nrecent advances of vision transformers (ViTs), we point out that using a few\nlarge kernels instead of a stack of small convolutions could be a more powerful\nparadigm. We therefore summarize 5 guidelines, e.g., applying re-parameterized\nlarge depth-wise convolutions, to design efficient high-performance\nlarge-kernel CNNs. Following the guidelines, we propose RepLKNet, a pure CNN\narchitecture whose kernel size is as large as 31x31. RepLKNet greatly bridges\nthe performance gap between CNNs and ViTs, e.g., achieving comparable or better\nresults than Swin Transformer on ImageNet and downstream tasks, while the\nlatency of RepLKNet is much lower. Moreover, RepLKNet also shows feasible\nscalability to big data and large models, obtaining 87.8% top-1 accuracy on\nImageNet and 56.0%} mIoU on ADE20K. At last, our study further suggests\nlarge-kernel CNNs share several nice properties with ViTs, e.g., much larger\neffective receptive fields than conventional CNNs, and higher shape bias rather\nthan texture bias.

    "abstract": "We study differentially private (DP) federated learning (FL) with non-convex\nloss functions and heterogeneous (non-i.i.d.) client data in the absence of a\ntrusted server, both with and without a secure \"shuffler\" to anonymize client\nreports. We propose novel algorithms that satisfy local differential privacy\n(LDP) at the client level and shuffle differential privacy (SDP) for three\nclasses of Lipschitz continuous loss functions: First, we consider losses\nsatisfying the Proximal Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality, which is an\nextension of the classical PL condition to the constrained setting. Prior works\nstudying DP PL optimization only consider the unconstrained problem with\nLipschitz loss functions, which rules out many interesting practical losses,\nsuch as strongly convex, least squares, and regularized logistic regression.\nHowever, by analyzing the proximal PL scenario, we permit such losses which are\nLipschitz on a restricted parameter domain. We propose LDP and SDP algorithms\nthat nearly attain the optimal strongly convex, homogeneous (i.i.d.) rates.\nSecond, we provide the first DP algorithms for non-convex/non-smooth loss\nfunctions. Third, we specialize our analysis to smooth, unconstrained\nnon-convex FL. Our bounds improve on the state-of-the-art, even in the special\ncase of a single client, and match the non-private lower bound in certain\npractical parameter regimes. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm\nyields better accuracy than baselines for most privacy levels.",

    "abstract": "The number and intensity of forest fires in the United States have been\nsteadily increasing and causing massive economic and ecological damage.\nOverhead transmission and distribution lines are typically disconnected\npreemptively near fires, a practice that causes high social cost. Deployment of\nPhasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and their ability for synchronized real-time\nmeasurement of voltage and current inspire the here proposed method for the\njust-in-time disconnection of overhead lines at the ignition or approach of\nfires. PMUs can detect ambient temperature changes caused by fires through the\nchange of line resistance. An ambient temperature model at the vicinity of a\nfire seat and the dynamic heat exchange model of the IEEE 738 dynamic line\nrating standard for bare overhead conductors are used in MATLAB Simulink to\nassess the performance of the proposed control method.

In contrast, this paper proves a weak completeness result for\nthe fragment without action iteration, and a strong completeness result for the\nfragment without action iteration and common knowledge. Our work involves a\ndetour into term rewriting theory. The argument uses modal filtration, and thus\nwe obtain the finite model property and hence decidability. We also give a\ntranslation of our largest language into PDL, thereby obtaining a second proof\nof decidability. The paper closes with some results on expressive power. These\nare mostly concerned with comparing the action-iteration-free language with\nmodal logic augmented by transitive closure operators.

Furthermore, weather and illumination capture conditions or\nocclusions may affect these footages due to the race staff and other runners.\nTo address this challenging task, we have tracked and codified the\nparticipant's running gait at some RPs and removed the context intending to\nensure a runner-of-interest proper evaluation.

For the analyses of both stationary and\nmobile storage markets, we use the public registrations of the German Federal\nNetwork Agency and the Federal Motor Transport Authority, our own databases\nfrom the monitoring of subsidy programs, and bilateral exchange with large\ncompanies. In comparison to 2020, the market for home storage systems (HSS)\ngrew by 50% in terms of battery energy in 2021 and is by far the largest\nstationary storage market in Germany. We estimate that about 145,000 HSS (1.27\nGWh / 0.73 GW) were installed solely in 2021. The average specific price for a\nmedium-sized HSS was about 1,000 EUR/kWh in 2021, showing a price decrease of\n8% from 2020 to 2021. The emerging market for industrial storage systems (ISS)\ngrew by 15% in 2021, with a total of 900 ISS (0.06 GWh / 0.03 GW) installed,\nalthough industrial PV installations decreased. The market growth for\nlarge-scale storage systems (LSS) remains on a relatively low level with 11 LSS\n(0.03 GWh / 0.04 GW) commissioned. The market for battery electric vehicles\n(EV) doubled in 2021 and new registrations raised to 680,000 EV (22.45 GWh /\n31.18 GW). The public charging infrastructure could not follow this growth and\ngrew linearly with about 11,700 new installations to 50,000 charging points,\nmost of which are up to 22 kW.

The $d$-claw vertex deletion\nproblem, $d$-CLAW-VD, asks for a given graph $G$ and an integer $k$ if one can\ndelete at most $k$ vertices from $G$ such that the resulting graph has no\n$d$-claw as an induced subgraph. Thus, 1-CLAW-VD and 2-CLAW-VD are just the\nfamous VERTEX COVER problem and the CLUSTER VERTEX DELETION problem,\nrespectively. In this paper, we strengthen a hardness result in [M. Yannakakis,\nNode-Deletion Problems on Bipartite Graphs, SIAM J. Comput. (1981)], by showing\nthat CLUSTER VERTEX DELETION remains NP-complete when restricted to bipartite\ngraphs of maximum degree 3. Moreover, for every $d\\ge 3$, we show that\n$d$-CLAW-VD is NP-complete even when restricted to bipartite graphs of maximum\ndegree $d$. These hardness results are optimal with respect to degree\nconstraint. By extending the hardness result in [F.

On the\npositive side, we prove that $d$-CLAW-VD is polynomially solvable on what we\ncall $d$-block graphs, a class properly contains all block graphs. This result\nextends the polynomial-time algorithm in [Y. Cao et al., Vertex deletion\nproblems on chordal graphs, Theor. Comput. Sci.

    "abstract": "As machine learning (ML) models are increasingly being deployed in\nhigh-stakes applications, there has been growing interest in providing recourse\nto individuals adversely impacted by model predictions (e.g., an applicant\nwhose loan has been denied). To this end, several post hoc techniques have been\nproposed in recent literature. These techniques generate recourses under the\nassumption that the affected individuals will implement the prescribed\nrecourses exactly. However, recent studies suggest that individuals often\nimplement recourses in a noisy and inconsistent manner - e.g., raising their\nsalary by \\$505 if the prescribed recourse suggested an increase of \\$500.\nMotivated by this, we introduce and study the problem of recourse invalidation\nin the face of noisy human responses. More specifically, we theoretically and\nempirically analyze the behavior of state-of-the-art algorithms, and\ndemonstrate that the recourses generated by these algorithms are very likely to\nbe invalidated if small changes are made to them. We further propose a novel\nframework, EXPECTing noisy responses (EXPECT), which addresses the\naforementioned problem by explicitly minimizing the probability of recourse\ninvalidation in the face of noisy responses.

    "abstract": "Convolution is conventionally defined as a linear operation on functions of\none or more variables which commutes with shifts. Group convolution generalizes\nthe concept to linear operations on functions of group elements representing\nmore general geometric transformations and which commute with those\ntransformations. Since similarity transformation is the most general geometric\ntransformation on images that preserves shape, the group convolution that is\nequivariant to similarity transformation is the most general shape preserving\nlinear operator. Because similarity transformations have four free parameters,\ngroup convolutions are defined on four-dimensional, joint orientation-scale\nspaces. Although prior work on equivariant linear operators has been limited to\ndiscrete groups, the similarity group is continuous. In this paper, we describe\nlinear operators on discrete representations that are equivariant to continuous\nsimilarity transformation. This is achieved by using a basis of functions that\nis it joint shiftable-twistable-scalable. These it pinwheel functions use\nFourier series in the orientation dimension and Laplace transform in the\nlog-scale dimension to form a basis of spatially localized functions that can\nbe continuously interpolated in position, orientation and scale. Although this\nresult is potentially significant with respect to visual computation generally,\nwe present an initial demonstration of its utility by using it to compute a\nshape equivariant distribution of closed contours traced by particles\nundergoing Brownian motion in velocity. The contours are constrained by sets of\npoints and line endings representing well known bistable illusory contour\ninducing patterns.",

    "abstract": "Because the magnitude of inner products with its basis functions are\ninvariant to rotation and scale change, the Fourier-Mellin transform has long\nbeen used as a component in Euclidean invariant 2D shape recognition systems.\nYet Fourier-Mellin transform magnitudes are only invariant to rotation and\nscale changes about a known center point, and full Euclidean invariant shape\nrecognition is not possible except when this center point can be consistently\nand accurately identified. In this paper, we describe a system where a\nFourier-Mellin transform is computed at every point in the image. The spatial\nsupport of the Fourier-Mellin basis functions is made local by multiplying them\nwith a polynomial envelope. Significantly, the magnitudes of convolutions with\nthese complex filters at isolated points are not (by themselves) used as\nfeatures for Euclidean invariant shape recognition because reliable\ndiscrimination would require filters with spatial support large enough to fully\nencompass the shapes. Instead, we rely on the fact that normalized histograms\nof magnitudes are fully Euclidean invariant. We demonstrate a system based on\nthe VLAD machine learning method that performs Euclidean invariant recognition\nof 2D shapes and requires an order of magnitude less training data than\ncomparable methods based on convolutional neural networks.",

Detection of sentences that contain sensitive\ninformation in documents can help organisations prevent the leakage of valuable\nconfidential information. This is especially challenging when such sentences\ncontain a substantial amount of information or are paraphrased versions of\nknown sensitive content.

In this paper, we wish to explore whether pre-trained\ntransformer models are well suited to detect complex sensitive information.\nPre-trained transformers are typically trained on an enormous amount of text\nand therefore readily learn grammar, structure and other linguistic features,\nmaking them particularly attractive for this task.

We study the Local\nSGD method, where agents perform a number of local stochastic gradient steps\nand occasionally communicate with a central node to improve their local\noptimization tasks. We analyze the effect of local steps on the convergence\nrate and the communication complexity of Local SGD. Existing literature assumes\na fixed number of local steps across all communication rounds.

    "abstract": "In many personalized recommendation scenarios, the generalization ability of\na target task can be improved via learning with additional auxiliary tasks\nalongside this target task on a multi-task network. However, this method often\nsuffers from a serious optimization imbalance problem. On the one hand, one or\nmore auxiliary tasks might have a larger influence than the target task and\neven dominate the network weights, resulting in worse recommendation accuracy\nfor the target task. On the other hand, the influence of one or more auxiliary\ntasks might be too weak to assist the target task. More challenging is that\nthis imbalance dynamically changes throughout the training process and varies\nacross the parts of the same network. We propose a new method: MetaBalance to\nbalance auxiliary losses via directly manipulating their gradients w.r.t the\nshared parameters in the multi-task network. Specifically, in each training\niteration and adaptively for each part of the network, the gradient of an\nauxiliary loss is carefully reduced or enlarged to have a closer magnitude to\nthe gradient of the target loss, preventing auxiliary tasks from being so\nstrong that dominate the target task or too weak to help the target task.\nMoreover, the proximity between the gradient magnitudes can be flexibly\nadjusted to adapt MetaBalance to different scenarios.

Therefore, the objective of this work\nis to adopt metamorphic testing to examine the reliability of the selected\ndeepfake detection model, and how the transformation of input variation places\ninfluence on the output.

We construct\ngraphs that are robust to uncertainties in linking browsing histories to\ndevices. Moreover, we adapt random walk with restart to compute similarity\nscores between devices based on the graphs. GraphTrack leverages the similarity\nscores to perform cross-device tracking. GraphTrack does not require labeled\ndevice pairs and can incorporate them if available. We evaluate GraphTrack on\ntwo real-world datasets, i.e., a publicly available mobile-desktop tracking\ndataset (around 100 users) and a multiple-device tracking dataset (154K users)\nwe collected. Our results show that GraphTrack substantially outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art on both datasets.",

    "abstract": "Embedded devices are ubiquitous. However, preliminary evidence shows that\nattack mitigations protecting our desktops/servers/phones are missing in\nembedded devices, posing a significant threat to embedded security. To this\nend, this paper presents an in-depth study on the adoption of common attack\nmitigations on embedded devices. Precisely, it measures the presence of\nstandard mitigations against memory corruptions in over 10k Linux-based\nfirmware of deployed embedded devices.\nThe study reveals that embedded devices largely omit both user-space and\nkernel-level attack mitigations. The adoption rates on embedded devices are\nmultiple times lower than their desktop counterparts. An equally important\nobservation is that the situation is not improving over time. Without changing\nthe current practices, the attack mitigations will remain missing, which may\nbecome a bigger threat in the upcoming IoT era.\nThroughout follow-up analyses, we further inferred a set of factors possibly\ncontributing to the absence of attack mitigations. The exemplary ones include\nmassive reuse of non-protected software, lateness in upgrading outdated\nkernels, and restrictions imposed by automated building tools. We envision\nthese will turn into insights towards improving the adoption of attack\nmitigations on embedded devices in the future.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is one of the prominent tasks of\ntransfer learning, and it provides an effective approach to mitigate the\ndistribution shift between the labeled source domain and the unlabeled target\ndomain. Prior works mainly focus on aligning the marginal distributions or the\nestimated class-conditional distributions. However, the joint dependency among\nthe feature and the label is crucial for the adaptation task and is not fully\nexploited. To address this problem, we propose the Bures Joint Distribution\nAlignment (BJDA) algorithm which directly models the joint distribution shift\nbased on the optimal transport theory in the infinite-dimensional kernel\nspaces. Specifically, we propose a novel alignment loss term that minimizes the\nkernel Bures-Wasserstein distance between the joint distributions. Technically,\nBJDA can effectively capture the nonlinear structures underlying the data. In\naddition, we introduce a dynamic margin in contrastive learning phase to\nflexibly characterize the class separability and improve the discriminative\nability of representations. It also avoids the cross-validation procedure to\ndetermine the margin parameter in traditional triplet loss based methods.\nExtensive experiments show that BJDA is very effective for the UDA tasks, as it\noutperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in most experimental settings. In\nparticular, BJDA improves the average accuracy of UDA tasks by 2.8% on\nAdaptiope, 1.4% on Office-Caltech10, and 1.1% on ImageCLEF-DA.",

    "abstract": "Mix-based augmentation has been proven fundamental to the generalization of\ndeep vision models. However, current augmentations only mix samples at the\ncurrent data batch during training, which ignores the possible knowledge\naccumulated in the learning history. In this paper, we propose a recursive\nmixed-sample learning paradigm, termed \"RecursiveMix\" (RM), by exploring a\nnovel training strategy that leverages the historical input-prediction-label\ntriplets. More specifically, we iteratively resize the input image batch from\nthe previous iteration and paste it into the current batch while their labels\nare fused proportionally to the area of the operated patches. Further, a\nconsistency loss is introduced to align the identical image semantics across\nthe iterations, which helps the learning of scale-invariant feature\nrepresentations. Based on ResNet-50, RM largely improves classification\naccuracy by $\\sim$3.2\\% on CIFAR100 and $\\sim$2.8\\% on ImageNet with negligible\nextra computation/storage costs. In the downstream object detection task, the\nRM pretrained model outperforms the baseline by 2.1 AP points and surpasses\nCutMix by 1.4 AP points under the ATSS detector on COCO.

This restriction can be due to different manufacturers\nin the former case, and people wearing more or less measurement devices in the\nlatter (ii) We are not allowed to store or re-access data from a task once it\nhas been observed at the task level. This may be due to privacy considerations\nin the case of people, or legal restrictions placed by machine owners.\nNevertheless, we would like to (a) improve performance on subsequent tasks\nusing experience from completed tasks as well as (b) continue to perform better\non past tasks, e.g., update the model and improve predictions on even the first\nmachine after learning from subsequently observed ones. We note that existing\ncontinual learning methods do not take into account variability in input\ndimensions arising due to different subsets of sensors being available across\ntasks, and struggle to adapt to such variable input dimensions (VID) tasks.

The question of whether interactivity helps with\nnatural inference tasks has been a topic of active research. We settle this\nquestion in the affirmative for the prototypical problems of high-dimensional\nsparse mean estimation and compressive sensing, by demonstrating a gap between\ninteractive and noninteractive protocols. We further establish that the gap\nincreases when we have more structured sparsity: for block sparsity this gap\ncan be as large as polynomial in the dimensionality. Thus, the more structured\nthe sparsity is, the greater is the advantage of interaction.

    "title": "TSR-DSAW: Table Structure Recognition via Deep Spatial Association of  Words",
    "abstract": "Existing methods for Table Structure Recognition (TSR) from camera-captured\nor scanned documents perform poorly on complex tables consisting of nested rows\n/ columns, multi-line texts and missing cell data. This is because current\ndata-driven methods work by simply training deep models on large volumes of\ndata and fail to generalize when an unseen table structure is encountered. In\nthis paper, we propose to train a deep network to capture the spatial\nassociations between different word pairs present in the table image for\nunravelling the table structure. We present an end-to-end pipeline, named\nTSR-DSAW: TSR via Deep Spatial Association of Words, which outputs a digital\nrepresentation of a table image in a structured format such as HTML. Given a\ntable image as input, the proposed method begins with the detection of all the\nwords present in the image using a text-detection network like CRAFT which is\nfollowed by the generation of word-pairs using dynamic programming. These\nword-pairs are highlighted in individual images and subsequently, fed into a\nDenseNet-121 classifier trained to capture spatial associations such as\nsame-row, same-column, same-cell or none. Finally, we perform post-processing\non the classifier output to generate the table structure in HTML format. We\nevaluate our TSR-DSAW pipeline on two public table-image datasets -- PubTabNet\nand ICDAR 2013, and demonstrate improvement over previous methods such as\nTableNet and DeepDeSRT.",

    "abstract": "The recently developed DEtection TRansformer (DETR) establishes a new object\ndetection paradigm by eliminating a series of hand-crafted components. However,\nDETR suffers from extremely slow convergence, which increases the training cost\nsignificantly. We observe that the slow convergence is largely attributed to\nthe complication in matching object queries with target features in different\nfeature embedding spaces. This paper presents SAM-DETR, a\nSemantic-Aligned-Matching DETR that greatly accelerates DETR's convergence\nwithout sacrificing its accuracy. SAM-DETR addresses the convergence issue from\ntwo perspectives. First, it projects object queries into the same embedding\nspace as encoded image features, where the matching can be accomplished\nefficiently with aligned semantics. Second, it explicitly searches salient\npoints with the most discriminative features for semantic-aligned matching,\nwhich further speeds up the convergence and boosts detection accuracy as well.\nBeing like a plug and play, SAM-DETR complements existing convergence solutions\nwell yet only introduces slight computational overhead. Extensive experiments\nshow that the proposed SAM-DETR achieves superior convergence as well as\ncompetitive detection accuracy.

In this\npaper, we exploit the domain information present in computed tomography (CT)\nscans and propose a robust universal lesion detection (ULD) network that can\ndetect lesions across all organs of the body by training on a single dataset,\nDeepLesion. We analyze CT-slices of varying intensities, generated using\nheuristically determined Hounsfield Unit(HU) windows that individually\nhighlight different organs and are given as inputs to the deep network. The\nfeatures obtained from the multiple intensity images are fused using a novel\nconvolution augmented multi-head self-attention module and subsequently, passed\nto a Region Proposal Network (RPN) for lesion detection. In addition, we\nobserved that traditional anchor boxes used in RPN for natural images are not\nsuitable for lesion sizes often found in medical images. Therefore, we propose\nto use lesion-specific anchor sizes and ratios in the RPN for improving the\ndetection performance. We use self-supervision to initialize weights of our\nnetwork on the DeepLesion dataset to further imbibe domain knowledge. Our\nproposed Domain Knowledge augmented Multi-head Attention based Universal Lesion\nDetection Network DMKA-ULD produces refined and precise bounding boxes around\nlesions across different organs. We evaluate the efficacy of our network on the\npublicly available DeepLesion dataset which comprises of approximately 32K CT\nscans with annotated lesions across all organs of the body.

    "abstract": "Modern autonomous vehicles (AVs) often rely on vision, LIDAR, and even\nradar-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) frameworks for precise\nlocalization and navigation. However, modern SLAM frameworks often lead to\nunacceptably high levels of drift (i.e., localization error) when AVs observe\nfew visually distinct features or encounter occlusions due to dynamic\nobstacles. This paper argues that minimizing drift must be a key desiderata in\nAV motion planning, which requires an AV to take active control decisions to\nmove towards feature-rich regions while also minimizing conventional control\ncost. To do so, we first introduce a novel data-driven perception module that\nobserves LIDAR point clouds and estimates which features/regions an AV must\nnavigate towards for drift minimization. Then, we introduce an interpretable\nmodel predictive controller (MPC) that moves an AV toward such feature-rich\nregions while avoiding visual occlusions and gracefully trading off drift and\ncontrol cost. Our experiments on challenging, dynamic scenarios in the\nstate-of-the-art CARLA simulator indicate our method reduces drift up to 76.76%\ncompared to benchmark approaches.",

    "abstract": "Despite the success, the process of fine-tuning large-scale PLMs brings\nprohibitive adaptation costs. In fact, fine-tuning all the parameters of a\ncolossal model and retaining separate instances for different tasks are\npractically infeasible. This necessitates a new branch of research focusing on\nthe parameter-efficient adaptation of PLMs, dubbed as delta tuning in this\npaper. In contrast with the standard fine-tuning, delta tuning only fine-tunes\na small portion of the model parameters while keeping the rest untouched,\nlargely reducing both the computation and storage costs. Recent studies have\ndemonstrated that a series of delta tuning methods with distinct tuned\nparameter selection could achieve performance on a par with full-parameter\nfine-tuning, suggesting a new promising way of stimulating large-scale PLMs. In\nthis paper, we first formally describe the problem of delta tuning and then\ncomprehensively review recent delta tuning approaches.

In order to realize this hierarchical learning pattern, this paper,\nfor the first time, formulates the HML framework using the new Concept\nReconstruction (CR) and Model Reconstruction (MR) constraints.

    "abstract": "Coverage guided fuzzing (CGF) is an effective testing technique which has\ndetected hundreds of thousands of bugs from various software applications. It\nfocuses on maximizing code coverage to reveal more bugs during fuzzing.\nHowever, a higher coverage does not necessarily imply a better fault detection\ncapability. Triggering a bug involves not only exercising the specific program\npath but also reaching interesting program states in that path. In this paper,\nwe use mutation testing to improve CGF in detecting bugs. We use mutation\nscores as feedback to guide fuzzing towards detecting bugs rather than just\ncovering code. To evaluate our approach, we conduct a well-designed experiment\non 5 benchmarks. We choose the state-of-the-art fuzzing technique Zest as\nbaseline and construct two modified techniques on it using our approach. The\nexperimental results show that our approach can improve CGF in both code\ncoverage and bug detection.",

    "abstract": "Continuous subgraph matching (CSM) algorithms find the occurrences of a given\npattern on a stream of data graphs online. A number of incremental CSM\nalgorithms have been proposed. However, a systematical study on these\nalgorithms is missing to identify their advantages and disadvantages on a wide\nrange of workloads. Therefore, we first propose to model CSM as incremental\nview maintenance (IVM) to capture the design space of existing algorithms.\nThen, we implement six representative CSM algorithms, including IncIsoMatch,\nSJ-Tree, Graphflow, IEDyn, TurboFlux, and SymBi, in a common framework based on\nIVM. We further conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the overall\nperformance of competing algorithms as well as study the effectiveness of\nindividual techniques to pinpoint the key factors leading to the performance\ndifferences. We obtain the following new insights into the performance: (1)\nexisting algorithms start the search from an edge in the query graph that maps\nto an updated data edge, potentially leading to many invalid partial results;\n(2) all matching orders are based on simple heuristics, which appear\nineffective at times; (3) index updates dominate the query time on some\nqueries; and (4) the algorithm with constant delay enumeration bears\nsignificant index update cost. Consequently, no algorithm dominates the others\nin all cases. Therefore, we give a few recommendations based on our experiment\nresults. In particular, the SymBi index is useful for sparse queries or long\nrunning queries. The matching orders of IEDyn and TurboFlux work well on tree\nqueries, those of Graphflow on dense queries or when both query and data graphs\nare sparse, and otherwise, we recommend SymBi's matching orders.",

    "abstract": "Learning with few labeled data has been a longstanding problem in the\ncomputer vision and machine learning research community. In this paper, we\nintroduced a new semi-supervised learning framework, SimMatch, which\nsimultaneously considers semantic similarity and instance similarity. In\nSimMatch, the consistency regularization will be applied on both semantic-level\nand instance-level. The different augmented views of the same instance are\nencouraged to have the same class prediction and similar similarity\nrelationship respected to other instances. Next, we instantiated a labeled\nmemory buffer to fully leverage the ground truth labels on instance-level and\nbridge the gaps between the semantic and instance similarities. Finally, we\nproposed the \\textit{unfolding} and \\textit{aggregation} operation which allows\nthese two similarities be isomorphically transformed with each other. In this\nway, the semantic and instance pseudo-labels can be mutually propagated to\ngenerate more high-quality and reliable matching targets. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that SimMatch improves the performance of\nsemi-supervised learning tasks across different benchmark datasets and\ndifferent settings. Notably, with 400 epochs of training, SimMatch achieves\n67.2\\%, and 74.4\\% Top-1 Accuracy with 1\\% and 10\\% labeled examples on\nImageNet, which significantly outperforms the baseline methods and is better\nthan previous semi-supervised learning frameworks.

    "abstract": "Affective computing plays a key role in human-computer interactions,\nentertainment, teaching, safe driving, and multimedia integration. Major\nbreakthroughs have been made recently in the areas of affective computing\n(i.e., emotion recognition and sentiment analysis). Affective computing is\nrealized based on unimodal or multimodal data, primarily consisting of physical\ninformation (e.g., textual, audio, and visual data) and physiological signals\n(e.g., EEG and ECG signals). Physical-based affect recognition caters to more\nresearchers due to multiple public databases. However, it is hard to reveal\none's inner emotion hidden purposely from facial expressions, audio tones, body\ngestures, etc. Physiological signals can generate more precise and reliable\nemotional results; yet, the difficulty in acquiring physiological signals also\nhinders their practical application. Thus, the fusion of physical information\nand physiological signals can provide useful features of emotional states and\nlead to higher accuracy. Instead of focusing on one specific field of affective\nanalysis, we systematically review recent advances in the affective computing,\nand taxonomize unimodal affect recognition as well as multimodal affective\nanalysis. Firstly, we introduce two typical emotion models followed by commonly\nused databases for affective computing. Next, we survey and taxonomize\nstate-of-the-art unimodal affect recognition and multimodal affective analysis\nin terms of their detailed architectures and performances. Finally, we discuss\nsome important aspects on affective computing and their applications and\nconclude this review with an indication of the most promising future\ndirections, such as the establishment of baseline dataset, fusion strategies\nfor multimodal affective analysis, and unsupervised learning models.",

This implies that these models do not\nlearn to recognise speech from scratch without prior knowledge and explicit\nsupervision. Visually grounded speech models learn to recognise speech without\nprior knowledge by exploiting statistical dependencies between spoken and\nvisual input. While it has previously been shown that visually grounded speech\nmodels learn to recognise the presence of words in the input, we explicitly\ninvestigate such a model as a model of human speech recognition.\nMethods: We investigate the time-course of word recognition as simulated by\nthe model using a gating paradigm to test whether its recognition is affected\nby well-known word-competition effects in human speech processing. We\nfurthermore investigate whether vector quantisation, a technique for discrete\nrepresentation learning, aids the model in the discovery and recognition of\nwords.\nResults/Conclusion: Our experiments show that the model is able to recognise\nnouns in isolation and even learns to properly differentiate between plural and\nsingular nouns. We also find that recognition is influenced by word competition\nfrom the word-initial cohort and neighbourhood density, mirroring word\ncompetition effects in human speech comprehension. Lastly, we find no evidence\nthat vector quantisation is helpful in discovering and recognising words. Our\ngating experiments even show that the vector quantised model requires more of\nthe input sequence for correct recognition.",

Current methods handle incremental learning\nretrospectively by making the updated model similar to the old one.

Forward compatibility\nrequires future new classes to be easily incorporated into the current model\nbased on the current stage data, and we seek to realize it by reserving\nembedding space for future new classes. In detail, we assign virtual prototypes\nto squeeze the embedding of known classes and reserve for new ones. Besides, we\nforecast possible new classes and prepare for the updating process. The virtual\nprototypes allow the model to accept possible updates in the future, which act\nas proxies scattered among embedding space to build a stronger classifier\nduring inference.

Yet, using JS increases bandwidth and battery\nconsumption as scripts need to be downloaded and processed by the browser.\nPlus, client-side JS may expose visitors to security vulnerabilities such as\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS).This paper introduces a new server-side plugin,\ncalled JSRehab, that automatically rewrites common web interface components by\nalternatives that do not require any JavaScript (JS). The main objective of\nJSRehab is to drastically reduce-and ultimately remove-the inclusion of JS in a\nweb page to improve its responsiveness and consume less resources. We report on\nour implementation of JS-Rehab for Bootstrap, the most popular UI framework by\nfar, and evaluate it on a corpus of 100 webpages. We show through manual\nvalidation that it is indeed possible to lower the dependencies of pages on JS\nwhile keeping intact its interactivity and accessibility. We observe that\nJSRehab brings energy savings of at least 5 % for the majority of web pages on\nthe tested devices, while introducing a median on-the-wire overhead of only 5 %\nto the HTML payload.",

The\nstate-of-the-art graph-based encoder has been successfully used in this task\nbut does not model the question syntax well. In this paper, we propose\nS$^2$SQL, injecting Syntax to question-Schema graph encoder for Text-to-SQL\nparsers, which effectively leverages the syntactic dependency information of\nquestions in text-to-SQL to improve the performance. We also employ the\ndecoupling constraint to induce diverse relational edge embedding, which\nfurther improves the network's performance.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) holds promise in leveraging large amounts of\nunlabeled data. However, the success of popular SSL methods has limited on\nsingle-centric-object images like those in ImageNet and ignores the correlation\namong the scene and instances, as well as the semantic difference of instances\nin the scene. To address the above problems, we propose a Unified\nSelf-supervised Visual Pre-training (UniVIP), a novel self-supervised framework\nto learn versatile visual representations on either single-centric-object or\nnon-iconic dataset. The framework takes into account the representation\nlearning at three levels: 1) the similarity of scene-scene, 2) the correlation\nof scene-instance, 3) the discrimination of instance-instance. During the\nlearning, we adopt the optimal transport algorithm to automatically measure the\ndiscrimination of instances. Massive experiments show that UniVIP pre-trained\non non-iconic COCO achieves state-of-the-art transfer performance on a variety\nof downstream tasks, such as image classification, semi-supervised learning,\nobject detection and segmentation. Furthermore, our method can also exploit\nsingle-centric-object dataset such as ImageNet and outperforms BYOL by 2.5%\nwith the same pre-training epochs in linear probing, and surpass current\nself-supervised object detection methods on COCO dataset, demonstrating its\nuniversality and potential.",

    "abstract": "We study two-player concurrent stochastic games on finite graphs, with\nB\\\"uchi and co-B\\\"uchi objectives. The goal of the first player is to maximize\nthe probability of satisfying the given objective. Following Martin's\ndeterminacy theorem for Blackwell games, we know that such games have a value.\nNatural questions are then: does there exist an optimal strategy, that is, a\nstrategy achieving the value of the game? what is the memory required for\nplaying (almost-)optimally? The situation is rather simple to describe for\nturn-based games, where positional pure strategies suffice to play optimally in\ngames with parity objectives. Concurrency makes the situation intricate and\nheterogeneous. For most {\\omega}-regular objectives, there do indeed not exist\noptimal strategies in general. For some objectives (that we will mention),\ninfinite memory might also be required for playing optimally or\nalmost-optimally. We also provide characterizations of local interactions of\nthe players to ensure positionality of (almost-)optimal strategies for B\\\"uchi\nand co-B\\\"uchi objectives. This characterization relies on properties of game\nforms underpinning the formalism for defining local interactions of the two\nplayers.

    "abstract": "Real noisy-clean pairs on a large scale are costly and difficult to obtain.\nMeanwhile, supervised denoisers trained on synthetic data perform poorly in\npractice. Self-supervised denoisers, which learn only from single noisy images,\nsolve the data collection problem. However, self-supervised denoising methods,\nespecially blindspot-driven ones, suffer sizable information loss during input\nor network design. The absence of valuable information dramatically reduces the\nupper bound of denoising performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet\nefficient approach called Blind2Unblind to overcome the information loss in\nblindspot-driven denoising methods. First, we introduce a global-aware mask\nmapper that enables global perception and accelerates training. The mask mapper\nsamples all pixels at blind spots on denoised volumes and maps them to the same\nchannel, allowing the loss function to optimize all blind spots at once.\nSecond, we propose a re-visible loss to train the denoising network and make\nblind spots visible. The denoiser can learn directly from raw noise images\nwithout losing information or being trapped in identity mapping. We also\ntheoretically analyze the convergence of the re-visible loss. Extensive\nexperiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior\nperformance of our approach compared to previous work.

First,\nunder arbitrary switching rules, the stability analysis must be generally\ncarried out with respect to a compact set with non-empty interior rather than\nto a singleton. We provide a novel proof technique for existence and outer\napproximation of attractive invariant sets of a switched affine system, under\nthe hypothesis of global uniform stability of its linearization. On the other\nhand, considering dwell-time switching signals, forward invariant sets need not\nexist for this class of switched systems, even for stable ones. Hence, more\ngeneral notions of stability/boundedness are introduced and studied,\nhighlighting the relations of these concepts to the uniform stability of the\nlinear part of the system under the same class of dwell-time switching signals.\nThese results reveal the main differences and specificities of switched affine\nsystems with respect to linear ones, providing a first step for the analysis of\nswitched systems composed by subsystems not sharing the same equilibrium.\nNumerical methods based on linear matrix inequalities and sum-of-squares\nprogramming are presented and illustrate the developed theory.",

Namely, the Jacobian of an imaginary hyperelliptic curve defined over\n$\\mathbb{F}_q$ acts on a subset of isomorphism classes of Drinfeld modules. We\ndescribe an algorithm to compute the group action efficiently. This is a\nfunction field analog of the Couveignes-Rostovtsev-Stolbunov group action. Our\nproof-of-concept C++/NTL implementation only requires a fraction of a second on\na standard computer. Also, we state a conjecture - supported by experiments -\nwhich implies that the current fastest algorithm to solve its inverse problem\nruns in exponential time. This action is therefore a promising candidate for\nthe construction of \\emph{Hard Homogeneous Spaces}, which are the building\nblocks of several post-quantum cryptographic protocols. This demonstrates the\nrelevance of using imaginary hyperelliptic curves and Drinfeld modules as an\nalternative to the standard setting of imaginary quadratic number fields and\nelliptic curves for isogeny-based cryptographic applications. Moreover, our\nfunction field setting enables the use of Kedlaya's algorithm and its variants\nfor computing the order of the group in polynomial time when $q$ is fixed. No\nsuch polynomial-time algorithm for imaginary quadratic number fields is known.\nFor $q=2$ and parameters similar to CSIDH-512, we compute this order more than\n8500 times faster than the record computation for CSIDH-512 by Beullens,\nKleinjung and Vercauteren.",

This kind of study is also motivated by\ncomputational purposes for the solution of the related large linear systems\nusing the (preconditioned) MINRES algorithm. Here we complement the spectral\nstudy with more results holding both asymptotically and for a fixed dimension\n$n$, and with regard to eigenvalues and singular values: the final target is\nthe design of ad hoc procedures for the computation of the related spectra via\nmatrix-less algorithms, with a cost being linear in the number of computed\neigenvalues. We emphasize that the challenge of the case of non-monotone\ngenerating functions is considered in this note, for which the previous\nmatrix-less algorithms fail.

    "abstract": "Starting from 2021, the International Maritime Organization significantly\ntightened the $\\text{NO}_\\text{x}$ emission requirements for ships entering the\nBaltic and North Sea waters. Since all methods currently used for the ships'\ncompliance monitoring are costly and require proximity to the ship, the\nperformance of a global and continuous monitoring of the emission standards'\nfulfillment has been impossible up to now. A promising approach is the use of\nremote sensing with the recently launched TROPOMI/S5P satellite. Due to its\nunprecedentedly high spatial resolution, it allows for the visual distinction\nof $\\text{NO}_\\text{2}$ plumes of individual ships. To successfully deploy a\ncompliance monitoring system that is based on TROPOMI data, an automated\nprocedure for the attribution of $\\text{NO}_\\text{2}$ to individual ships has\nto be developed. However, due to the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio,\ninterference with the signal from other - often stronger - sources, and the\nabsence of ground truth, the task is very challenging.\nIn this study, we present an automated method for segmentation of plumes\nproduced by individual ships using TROPOMI satellite data - a first step\ntowards the automated procedure for global ship compliance monitoring. We\ndevelop a multivariate plume segmentation method based on various ships',\nwind's and spatial properties. For this, we propose to automatically define a\nregion of interest - a ship sector that we normalize with respect to scale and\norientation. We create a dataset, where each pixel has a label for belonging to\nthe respective ship plume or not. We train five linear and nonlinear\nclassifiers. The results show a significant improvement over the\nthreshold-based baselines. Moreover, the aggregated $\\text{NO}_\\text{2}$ levels\nof the segmented plumes show high correlation with the theoretically derived\nmeasure of ship's emission potential.",

However, there is\nstill a very limited understanding of the different mobility patterns among\nscholars with various socio-demographic characteristics. The aim of this study\nis twofold. First, we investigate to what extent individual factors associate\nwith the mobility of researchers. Second, we explore the relationship between\nmobility and scientific activity and impact. For this purpose, we used a\nbibliometric approach to track the mobility of authors. To compare the\nscientific outcomes of researchers, we considered the number of publications\nand received citations as indicators, as well as the number of unique\nco-authors in all their publications. We also analysed the co-authorship\nnetwork of researchers and compared centrality measures of mobile and\nnon-mobile researchers. Results show that researchers from North America and\nSub-Saharan Africa, particularly female ones, have the lowest, respectively,\nhighest tendency towards international mobility. Having international\nco-authors increases the probability of international movement. Our findings\nuncover gender inequality in international mobility across scientific fields\nand countries. Across genders, researchers in the Physical sciences have the\nmost and in the Social sciences the least rate of mobility. We observed more\nmobility for Social scientists at the advanced career stage, while researchers\nin other fields prefer to move at earlier career stages. Also, we found a\npositive correlation between mobility and scientific outcomes, but no apparent\ndifference between females and males. Comparing the centrality of mobile and\nnon-mobile researchers in the co-authorship networks reveals a higher social\ncapital advantage for mobile researchers.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning between different views of the data achieves outstanding\nsuccess in the field of self-supervised representation learning and the learned\nrepresentations are useful in broad downstream tasks. Since all supervision\ninformation for one view comes from the other view, contrastive learning\napproximately obtains the minimal sufficient representation which contains the\nshared information and eliminates the non-shared information between views.\nConsidering the diversity of the downstream tasks, it cannot be guaranteed that\nall task-relevant information is shared between views. Therefore, we assume the\nnon-shared task-relevant information cannot be ignored and theoretically prove\nthat the minimal sufficient representation in contrastive learning is not\nsufficient for the downstream tasks, which causes performance degradation. This\nreveals a new problem that the contrastive learning models have the risk of\nover-fitting to the shared information between views. To alleviate this\nproblem, we propose to increase the mutual information between the\nrepresentation and input as regularization to approximately introduce more\ntask-relevant information, since we cannot utilize any downstream task\ninformation during training. Extensive experiments verify the rationality of\nour analysis and the effectiveness of our method.

    "abstract": "The promise of active learning (AL) is to reduce labelling costs by selecting\nthe most valuable examples to annotate from a pool of unlabelled data.\nIdentifying these examples is especially challenging with high-dimensional data\n(e.g. images, videos) and in low-data regimes. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel method for batch AL called ALFA-Mix. We identify unlabelled instances\nwith sufficiently-distinct features by seeking inconsistencies in predictions\nresulting from interventions on their representations. We construct\ninterpolations between representations of labelled and unlabelled instances\nthen examine the predicted labels. We show that inconsistencies in these\npredictions help discovering features that the model is unable to recognise in\nthe unlabelled instances. We derive an efficient implementation based on a\nclosed-form solution to the optimal interpolation causing changes in\npredictions. Our method outperforms all recent AL approaches in 30 different\nsettings on 12 benchmarks of images, videos, and non-visual data. The\nimprovements are especially significant in low-data regimes and on self-trained\nvision transformers, where ALFA-Mix outperforms the state-of-the-art in 59% and\n43% of the experiments respectively.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Spiking Neural Networks (ASNNs) promise greater information\nprocessing efficiency because of discrete event-based (i.e., spike)\ncomputation. Several Machine Learning (ML) applications use biologically\ninspired plasticity mechanisms as unsupervised learning techniques to increase\nthe robustness of ASNNs while preserving efficiency. Spike Time Dependent\nPlasticity (STDP) and Intrinsic Plasticity (IP) (i.e., dynamic spiking\nthreshold adaptation) are two such mechanisms that have been combined to form\nan ensemble learning method. However, it is not clear how this ensemble\nlearning should be regulated based on spiking activity. Moreover, previous\nstudies have attempted threshold based synaptic pruning following STDP, to\nincrease inference efficiency at the cost of performance in ASNNs. However,\nthis type of structural adaptation, that employs individual weight mechanisms,\ndoes not consider spiking activity for pruning which is a better representation\nof input stimuli. We envisaged that plasticity-based spike-regulation and\nspike-based pruning will result in ASSNs that perform better in low resource\nsituations. In this paper, a novel ensemble learning method based on entropy\nand network activation is introduced, which is amalgamated with a spike-rate\nneuron pruning technique, operated exclusively using spiking activity. Two\nelectroencephalography (EEG) datasets are used as the input for classification\nexperiments with a three-layer feed forward ASNN trained using one-pass\nlearning.

    "abstract": "The few-shot learning ability of vision transformers (ViTs) is rarely\ninvestigated though heavily desired. In this work, we empirically find that\nwith the same few-shot learning frameworks, e.g., Meta-Baseline, replacing the\nwidely used CNN feature extractor with a ViT model often severely impairs\nfew-shot classification performance. Moreover, our empirical study shows that\nin the absence of inductive bias, ViTs often learn the dependencies among input\ntokens slowly under few-shot learning regime where only a few labeled training\ndata are available, which largely contributes to the above performance\ndegradation. To alleviate this issue, for the first time, we propose a simple\nyet effective few-shot training framework for ViTs, namely Self-promoted\nsUpervisioN (SUN). Specifically, besides the conventional global supervision\nfor global semantic learning, SUN further pretrains the ViT on the few-shot\nlearning dataset and then uses it to generate individual location-specific\nsupervision for guiding each patch token. This location-specific supervision\ntells the ViT which patch tokens are similar or dissimilar and thus accelerates\ntoken dependency learning. Moreover, it models the local semantics in each\npatch token to improve the object grounding and recognition capability which\nhelps learn generalizable patterns. To improve the quality of location-specific\nsupervision, we further propose two techniques:~1) background patch filtration\nto filtrate background patches out and assign them into an extra background\nclass; and 2) spatial-consistent augmentation to introduce sufficient diversity\nfor data augmentation while keeping the accuracy of the generated local\nsupervisions. Experimental results show that SUN using ViTs significantly\nsurpasses other few-shot learning frameworks with ViTs and is the first one\nthat achieves higher performance than those CNN state-of-the-arts.",

For large\npublishers, simultaneously selling impressions through both guaranteed\ncontracts and in-house RTB has become a popular choice. Generally speaking, a\npublisher needs to derive an impression allocation strategy between guaranteed\ncontracts and RTB to maximize its overall outcome (e.g., revenue and/or\nimpression quality). However, deriving the optimal strategy is not a trivial\ntask, e.g., the strategy should encourage incentive compatibility in RTB and\ntackle common challenges in real-world applications such as unstable traffic\npatterns (e.g., impression volume and bid landscape changing). In this paper,\nwe formulate impression allocation as an auction problem where each guaranteed\ncontract submits virtual bids for individual impressions. With this\nformulation, we derive the optimal bidding functions for the guaranteed\ncontracts, which result in the optimal impression allocation. In order to\naddress the unstable traffic pattern challenge and achieve the optimal overall\noutcome, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning method to adjust the\nbids from each guaranteed contract, which is simple, converging efficiently and\nscalable.

    "abstract": "The knowledge of the users' electricity consumption pattern is an important\ncoordinating mechanism between the utility company and the electricity\nconsumers in terms of key decision makings. The load decomposition is therefore\ncrucial to reveal the underlying relationship between the load consumption and\nits characteristics. However, load decomposition is conventionally performed on\nthe residential and commercial loads, and adequate consideration has not been\ngiven to the high-energy-consuming industrial loads leading to inefficient\nresults. This paper thus focuses on the load decomposition of the industrial\npark loads (IPL). The commonly used parameters in a conventional method are\nhowever inapplicable in high-energy-consuming industrial loads. Therefore, a\nmore robust approach is developed comprising a three-algorithm model to achieve\nthis goal on the IPL. First, the improved variational mode decomposition (IVMD)\nalgorithm is introduced to denoise the training data of the IPL and improve its\nstability. Secondly, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and simple\nrecurrent units (SRU) joint algorithms are used to achieve a non-intrusive and\nnon-invasive decomposition process of the IPL using a double-layer deep\nlearning network based on the IPL characteristics. Specifically, CNN is used to\nextract the IPL data characteristics while the improved long and short-term\nmemory (LSTM) network, SRU, is adopted to develop the decomposition model and\nfurther train the load data. Through the robust decomposition process, the\nunderlying relationship in the load consumption is extracted. The results\nobtained from the numerical examples show that this approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art in the conventional decomposition process.",

    "abstract": "The energy market relies on forecasting capabilities of both demand and power\ngeneration that need to be kept in dynamic balance. Today, when it comes to\nrenewable energy generation, such decisions are increasingly made in a\nliberalized electricity market environment, where future power generation must\nbe offered through contracts and auction mechanisms, hence based on forecasts.\nThe increased share of highly intermittent power generation from renewable\nenergy sources increases the uncertainty about the expected future power\ngeneration.

This\nwork first presents important concepts and approaches concerning probabilistic\nforecasts with deep learning.

Hence, for\ncity planners, the crucial question is where to place charging stations so that\nthey reach a large utilization. Here, we hypothesize that the utilization of EV\ncharging stations is driven by the proximity to points-of-interest (POIs), as\nEV owners have a certain limited willingness to walk between charging stations\nand POIs. To address our research question, we propose the use of web mining:\nwe characterize the influence of different POIs from OpenStreetMap on the\nutilization of charging stations. For this, we present a tailored interpretable\nmodel that takes into account the full spatial distributions of both the POIs\nand the charging stations. This allows us then to estimate the distance and\nmagnitude of the influence of different POI types. We evaluate our model with\ndata from approx. 300 charging stations and 4,000 POIs in Amsterdam,\nNetherlands. Our model achieves a superior performance over state-of-the-art\nbaselines and, on top of that, is able to offer an unmatched level of\ninterpretability. To the best of our knowledge, no previous paper has\nquantified the POI influence on charging station utilization from real-world\nusage data by estimating the spatial proximity in which POIs are relevant. As\nsuch, our findings help city planners in identifying effective locations for\ncharging stations.",

    "abstract": "Data science and informatics tools are developing at a blistering rate, but\ntheir users often lack the educational background or resources to efficiently\napply the methods to their research. Training resources often deprecate because\ntheir maintenance is not prioritized by funding, giving teams little time to\ndevote to such endeavors. Our group has developed Open-source Tools for\nTraining Resources (OTTR) to offer greater efficiency and flexibility for\ncreating and maintaining online course content. OTTR empowers creators to\ncustomize their work and allows for a simple workflow to publish using multiple\nplatforms. OTTR allows content creators to publish material to multiple massive\nonline learner communities using familiar rendering mechanics. OTTR allows the\nincorporation of pedagogical practices like formative and summative assessments\nin the form of multiple choice questions and fill in the blank problems that\nare automatically graded. No local installation of any software is required to\nbegin creating content with OTTR. Thus far, 15 courses have been created with\nOTTR repository template. By using the OTTR system, the maintenance workload\nfor updating these courses across platforms has been drastically reduced.",

However,\nexisting neural-based GEC models mainly aim at improving accuracy, and their\ninterpretability has not been explored. A promising approach for improving\ninterpretability is an example-based method, which uses similar retrieved\nexamples to generate corrections. In addition, examples are beneficial in\nlanguage learning, helping learners understand the basis of grammatically\nincorrect/correct texts and improve their confidence in writing. Therefore, we\nhypothesize that incorporating an example-based method into GEC can improve\ninterpretability as well as support language learners.

The examples consist of pairs of\ncorrect and incorrect sentences similar to a given input and its predicted\ncorrection.

The principle\nof IGM is demonstrated by the stability analysis method of the discrete system,\nand the parameter selection strategy of the IGM is analyzed in detail by\nsimulation. The advantages of the controller design method are verified by\ncomparative flight tests of nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) and INDI. The\nexperimental results show that the average trajectory tracking error of INDI is\nonly 58.3% of that of NDI under the same wind speed.

    "abstract": "Human activity detection from digital videos presents many challenges to the\ncomputer vision and image processing communities. Recently, many methods have\nbeen developed to detect human activities with varying degree of success. Yet,\nthe general human activity detection problem remains very challenging,\nespecially when the methods need to work 'in the wild' (e.g., without having\nprecise control over the imaging geometry). The thesis explores phase-based\nsolutions for (i) detecting faces, (ii) back of the heads, (iii) joint\ndetection of faces and back of the heads, and (iv) whether the head is looking\nto the left or the right, using standard video cameras without any control on\nthe imaging geometry. The proposed phase-based approach is based on the\ndevelopment of simple and robust methods that rely on the use of Amplitude\nModulation- Frequency Modulation (AM-FM) models. The approach is validated\nusing video frames extracted from the Advancing Out-of-school Learning in\nMathematics and Engineering (AOLME) project. The dataset consisted of 13,265\nimages from ten students looking at the camera, and 6,122 images from five\nstudents looking away from the camera. For the students facing the camera, the\nmethod was able to correctly classify 97.1% of them looking to the left and\n95.9% of them looking to the right. For the students facing the back of the\ncamera, the method was able to correctly classify 87.6% of them looking to the\nleft and 93.3% of them looking to the right.

    "abstract": "In the problem of semialgebraic range searching, we are to preprocess a set\nof points in $\\mathbb{R}^D$ such that the subset of points inside a\nsemialgebraic region described by $O(1)$ polynomial inequalities of degree\n$\\Delta$ can be found efficiently.\nRelatively recently, several major advances were made on this problem. Using\nalgebraic techniques, \"near-linear space\" structures [AMS13,MP15] with almost\noptimal query time of $Q(n)=O(n^{1-1/Delta+o(1)})$ were obtained. For \"fast\nquery\" structures (i.e., when $Q(n)=n^{o(1)}$), it was conjectured that a\nstructure with space $S(n) = O(n^{D+o(1)})$ is possible. The conjecture was\nrefuted recently by Afshani and Cheng [AC21]. In the plane, they proved that\n$S(n) = \\Omega(n^{\\Delta+1 - o(1)}/Q(n)^{(\\Delta+3)\\Delta/2})$ which shows\n$\\Omega(n^{\\Delta+1-o(1)})$ space is needed for $Q(n) = n^{o(1)}$. While this\nrefutes the conjecture, it still leaves a number of unresolved issues: the\nlower bound only works in 2D and for fast queries, and neither the exponent of\n$n$ or $Q(n)$ seem to be tight even for $D=2$, as the current upper bound is\n$S(n) = O(n^{\\boldsymbol{m}+o(1)}/Q(n)^{(\\boldsymbol{m}-1)D/(D-1)})$ where\n$\\boldsymbol{m}=\\binom{D+\\Delta}{D}-1 = \\Omega(\\Delta^D)$ is the maximum number\nof parameters to define a monic degree-$\\Delta$ $D$-variate polynomial, for any\n$D=O(1)$.\nIn this paper, we resolve two of the issues: we prove a lower bound in\n$D$-dimensions and show that when $Q(n)=n^{o(1)}+O(k)$,\n$S(n)=\\Omega(n^{\\boldsymbol{m}-o(1)})$, which is almost tight as far as the\nexponent of $n$ is considered in the pointer machine model. When considering\nthe exponent of $Q(n)$, we show that the analysis in [AC21] is tight for $D=2$,\nby presenting matching upper bounds for uniform random point sets. This shows\neither the existing upper bounds can be improved or a new fundamentally\ndifferent input set is needed to get a better lower bound.",

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction has gained great attention and significant progress has\nbeen made in recent years. However, most works rely on a key assumption that\neach video is successfully preprocessed by detection and tracking algorithms\nand the complete observed trajectory is always available. However, in complex\nreal-world environments, we often encounter miss-detection of target agents\n(e.g., pedestrian, vehicles) caused by the bad image conditions, such as the\nocclusion by other agents. In this paper, we address the problem of trajectory\nprediction from incomplete observed trajectory due to miss-detection, where the\nobserved trajectory includes several missing data points. We introduce a\ntwo-block RNN model that approximates the inference steps of the Bayesian\nfiltering framework and seeks the optimal estimation of the hidden state when\nmiss-detection occurs. The model uses two RNNs depending on the detection\nresult. One RNN approximates the inference step of the Bayesian filter with the\nnew measurement when the detection succeeds, while the other does the\napproximation when the detection fails. Our experiments show that the proposed\nmodel improves the prediction accuracy compared to the three baseline\nimputation methods on publicly available datasets: ETH and UCY ($9\\%$ and $7\\%$\nimprovement on the ADE and FDE metrics). We also show that our proposed method\ncan achieve better prediction compared to the baselines when there is no\nmiss-detection.",

    "abstract": "An actuator is a device that converts electricity into another form of\nenergy, typically physical movement. They are absolutely essential for any\nsystem that needs to impact or modify the physical world, and are used in\nmillions of systems of all sizes, all over the world, from cars and spacecraft\nto factory control systems and critical infrastructure. An actuator is a \"dumb\ndevice\" that is entirely controlled by the surrounding electronics, e.g., a\nmicrocontroller, and thus cannot authenticate its control signals or do any\nother form of processing. The problem we look at in this paper is how the wires\nthat connect an actuator to its control electronics can act like antennas,\npicking up electromagnetic signals from the environment. This makes it possible\nfor a remote attacker to wirelessly inject signals (energy) into these wires to\nbypass the controller and directly control the actuator.\nTo detect such attacks, we propose a novel detection method that allows the\nmicrocontroller to monitor the control signal and detect attacks as a deviation\nfrom the intended value. We have managed to do this without requiring the\nmicrocontroller to sample the signal at a high rate or run any signal\nprocessing. That makes our defense mechanism practical and easy to integrate\ninto existing systems. Our method is general and applies to any type of\nactuator (provided a few basic assumptions are met), and can deal with\nadversaries with arbitrarily high transmission power. We implement our\ndetection method on two different practical systems to show its generality,\neffectiveness, and robustness.",

    "abstract": "Optimizing compilers are mainly equipped to optimize control flow. The\noptimization of data structures is left to the programmer and it is the\nprogrammer's responsibility to design the data structures to suit the target\nhardware. Very specific data structures are required to exploit certain\nhardware features, such as cache line size, address alignment, vector width,\nand memory hierarchy specifics. Because optimizing compilers do not target data\nstructures, these features are explicitly encoded in program specifications.\nThis leads to convoluted programs that obscure the essence of the computation\nfrom the compiler, in turn causing compiler analysis techniques to break down\nand hampering compiler optimizations from being applied.\nTo solve this problem, we propose to move towards the specification of\nprograms without explicitly specifying the data structure. The compiler will\nautomatically generate actual data structures and executable code starting from\nthis specification. In this paper, we introduce a compiler-based framework to\nsupport this automatic generation of data structures, allowing the compiler to\ngo beyond the optimization of solely control flow and also target the way data\nis organized and accessed. As a case study of the effectiveness of this\nframework, we present a detailed description and experimental results of the\napplication of the proposed techniques to automatically generate data\nstructures for sparse matrix computations. We show that this way sparse data\nstructures can be generated that were up till now only specified by hand and\nthat automatically instantiated routines and corresponding data structures can\nbe found that outperform implementations of three existing sparse algebra\nlibraries.",

    "abstract": "Cross-modality interaction is a critical component in Text-Video Retrieval\n(TVR), yet there has been little examination of how different influencing\nfactors for computing interaction affect performance. This paper first studies\nthe interaction paradigm in depth, where we find that its computation can be\nsplit into two terms, the interaction contents at different granularity and the\nmatching function to distinguish pairs with the same semantics. We also observe\nthat the single-vector representation and implicit intensive function\nsubstantially hinder the optimization. Based on these findings, we propose a\ndisentangled framework to capture a sequential and hierarchical representation.\nFirstly, considering the natural sequential structure in both text and video\ninputs, a Weighted Token-wise Interaction (WTI) module is performed to decouple\nthe content and adaptively exploit the pair-wise correlations. This interaction\ncan form a better disentangled manifold for sequential inputs.

    "title": "RCL: Recurrent Continuous Localization for Temporal Action Detection",
    "abstract": "Temporal representation is the cornerstone of modern action detection\ntechniques. State-of-the-art methods mostly rely on a dense anchoring scheme,\nwhere anchors are sampled uniformly over the temporal domain with a discretized\ngrid, and then regress the accurate boundaries. In this paper, we revisit this\nfoundational stage and introduce Recurrent Continuous Localization (RCL), which\nlearns a fully continuous anchoring representation. Specifically, the proposed\nrepresentation builds upon an explicit model conditioned with video embeddings\nand temporal coordinates, which ensure the capability of detecting segments\nwith arbitrary length. To optimize the continuous representation, we develop an\neffective scale-invariant sampling strategy and recurrently refine the\nprediction in subsequent iterations. Our continuous anchoring scheme is fully\ndifferentiable, allowing to be seamlessly integrated into existing detectors,\ne.g., BMN and G-TAD. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that\nour continuous representation steadily surpasses other discretized counterparts\nby ~2% mAP. As a result, RCL achieves 52.92% mAP@0.5 on THUMOS14 and 37.65% mAP\non ActivtiyNet v1.3, outperforming all existing single-model detectors.",

    "abstract": "Structural health monitoring (SHM) has been an active research area for the\nlast three decades, and has accumulated a number of critical advances over that\nperiod, as can be seen in the literature. However, SHM is still facing\nchallenges because of the paucity of damage-state data, operational and\nenvironmental fluctuations, repeatability issues, and changes in boundary\nconditions. These issues present as inconsistencies in the captured features\nand can have a huge impact on the practical implementation, but more\ncritically, on the generalisation of the technology. Population-based SHM has\nbeen designed to address some of these concerns by modelling and transferring\nmissing information using data collected from groups of similar structures.\nIn this work, vibration data were collected from four healthy,\nnominally-identical, full-scale composite helicopter blades. Manufacturing\ndifferences (e.g., slight differences in geometry and/or material properties),\namong the blades presented as variability in their structural dynamics, which\ncan be very problematic for SHM based on machine learning from vibration data.\nThis work aims to address this variability by defining a general model for the\nfrequency response functions of the blades, called a form, using mixtures of\nGaussian processes.",

In this paper, we propose an architecture called Efficiently\nlead Inductive biases to ViT (EIT), which can effectively lead the inductive\nbiases to both phases of ViT. In the Patches Projection phase, a convolutional\nmax-pooling structure is used to produce overlapping patches. In the\nTransformer Encoder phase, we design a novel inductive bias introduction\nstructure called decreasing convolution, which is introduced parallel to the\nmulti-headed attention module, by which the embedding's different channels are\nprocessed respectively. In four popular small-scale datasets, compared with\nViT, EIT has an accuracy improvement of 12.6% on average with fewer parameters\nand FLOPs. Compared with ResNet, EIT exhibits higher accuracy with only 17.7%\nparameters and fewer FLOPs. Finally, ablation studies show that the EIT is\nefficient and does not require position embedding.

    "abstract": "Real-world scientific or engineering applications often involve mathematical\nmodeling of complex uncertain systems with a large number of unknown\nparameters. The complexity of such systems, and the enormous uncertainties\ntherein, typically make accurate model identification from the available data\ninfeasible. In such cases, it is desirable to represent the model uncertainty\nin a Bayesian paradigm, based on which we can design robust operators that\nmaintain the best overall performance across all possible models and design\noptimal experiments that can effectively reduce uncertainty to maximally\nenhance the performance of such operators. While objective-based uncertainty\nquantification (objective-UQ) based on MOCU (mean objective cost of\nuncertainty) has been shown to provide effective means for quantifying and\nhandling uncertainty in complex systems, a major drawback has been the high\ncomputational cost of estimating MOCU. In this work, we demonstrate for the\nfirst time that one can design accurate surrogate models for efficient\nobjective-UQ via MOCU based on a data-driven approach. We adopt a neural\nmessage passing model for surrogate modeling, which incorporates a novel\naxiomatic constraint loss that penalizes an increase in the estimated system\nuncertainty. As an illustrative example, we consider the optimal experimental\ndesign (OED) problem for uncertain Kuramoto models, where the goal is to\npredict the experiments that can most effectively enhance the robust\nsynchronization performance through uncertainty reduction. Through quantitative\nperformance assessment, we show that our proposed approach can accelerate\nMOCU-based OED by four to five orders of magnitude, virtually without any\nvisible loss of performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art. The\nproposed approach can be applied to general OED tasks, beyond the Kuramoto\nmodel.",

However, due to limitations inherent in the\ncollection process, RWE often lacks key features of patients, particularly when\nthese features cannot be directly encoded using data standards such as ICD-10.\nHere we propose a novel data-driven statistical machine learning approach,\nnamed Feature Imputation via Local Likelihood (FILL), designed to infer missing\nfeatures by exploiting feature similarity between patients. We test our method\nusing a particularly challenging problem: differentiating heart failure\npatients with reduced versus preserved ejection fraction (HFrEF and HFpEF\nrespectively). The complexity of the task stems from three aspects: the two\nshare many common characteristics and treatments, only part of the relevant\ndiagnoses may have been recorded, and the information on ejection fraction is\noften missing from RWE datasets. Despite these difficulties, our method is\nshown to be capable of inferring heart failure patients with HFpEF with a\nprecision above 80% when considering multiple scenarios across two RWE datasets\ncontaining 11,950 and 10,051 heart failure patients. This is an improvement\nwhen compared to classical approaches such as logistic regression and random\nforest which were only able to achieve a precision < 73%. Finally, this\napproach allows us to analyse which features are commonly associated with HFpEF\npatients. For example, we found that specific diagnostic codes for atrial\nfibrillation and personal history of long-term use of anticoagulants are often\nkey in identifying HFpEF patients.",

While translation scholars are\naware about the importance of having a reliable way to conduct the TQA process,\nit seems that there is limited literature facing the issue of reliability with\na quantitative approach. Here we consider the TQA as a complex process,\nconsidering it from the physics of complex systems point of view, and we face\nthe reliability issue with a Bayesian approach. Using a dataset of translation\nquality evaluations, in an error annotation setting, entirely produced by the\nLanguage Service Provider Translated Srl, we build two Bayesian models that\nparameterise the features involved in the TQA process, namely the translation\ndifficulty, the characteristics of the translators involved in producing the\ntranslation and assessing its quality (reviewers). After validating the models\nin an unsupervised setting, showing that it is possible to get meaningful\ninsights about translators even with just one review per translation job, we\nextract information about the translators and reviewers and we show that\nreviewers reliability cannot be taken for granted even if they are expert\ntranslators: the translator's expertise could induce also a cognitive bias when\nreviewing a translation produced by another translator. The most expert\ntranslators, though, show the highest level of consistency, both in the task of\ntranslating and in the one of assessing translation quality.",

This\nnotion has predominantly been studied for a fixed predictive model, sometimes\nunder different classification thresholds, striving to identify and eradicate\nits undesirable behaviour.

The requirement of\nsupporting both latency-sensitive and compute-intensive IoT tasks necessitates\nservice resilience, especially for the broker nodes in typical broker-worker\ndeployment designs. Existing fault-tolerance or resilience schemes often lack\nrobustness and generalization capability in non-stationary workload settings.\nThis is typically due to the expensive periodic fine-tuning of models required\nto adapt them in dynamic scenarios. To address this, we present a confidence\naware resilience model, CAROL, that utilizes a memory-efficient generative\nneural network to predict the Quality of Service (QoS) for a future state and a\nconfidence score for each prediction. Thus, whenever a broker fails, we quickly\nrecover the system by executing a local-search over the broker-worker topology\nspace and optimize future QoS. The confidence score enables us to keep track of\nthe prediction performance and run parsimonious neural network fine-tuning to\navoid excessive overheads, further improving the QoS of the system. Experiments\non a Raspberry-Pi based edge testbed with IoT benchmark applications show that\nCAROL outperforms state-of-the-art resilience schemes by reducing the energy\nconsumption, deadline violation rates and resilience overheads by up to 16, 17\nand 36 percent, respectively.",

To that end, we present Adversarial Knowledge\nDistillation (AKD), a new framework to improve a model's robust performance,\nconsisting on adversarially training a student on a mixture of the original\nlabels and the teacher outputs. Through carefully controlled ablation studies,\nwe show that using early-stopping, model ensembles and weak adversarial\ntraining are key techniques to maximize performance of the student, and show\nthat these insights generalize across different robust distillation techniques.\nFinally, we provide insights on the effect of robust knowledge distillation on\nthe dynamics of the student network, and show that AKD mostly improves the\ncalibration of the network and modify its training dynamics on samples that the\nmodel finds difficult to learn, or even memorize.",

    "abstract": "Recent segmentation methods, such as OCR and CPNet, utilizing \"class level\"\ninformation in addition to pixel features, have achieved notable success for\nboosting the accuracy of existing network modules. However, the extracted\nclass-level information was simply concatenated to pixel features, without\nexplicitly being exploited for better pixel representation learning. Moreover,\nthese approaches learn soft class centers based on coarse mask prediction,\nwhich is prone to error accumulation. In this paper, aiming to use class level\ninformation more effectively, we propose a universal Class-Aware Regularization\n(CAR) approach to optimize the intra-class variance and inter-class distance\nduring feature learning, motivated by the fact that humans can recognize an\nobject by itself no matter which other objects it appears with. Three novel\nloss functions are proposed. The first loss function encourages more compact\nclass representations within each class, the second directly maximizes the\ndistance between different class centers, and the third further pushes the\ndistance between inter-class centers and pixels. Furthermore, the class center\nin our approach is directly generated from ground truth instead of from the\nerror-prone coarse prediction. Our method can be easily applied to most\nexisting segmentation models during training, including OCR and CPNet, and can\nlargely improve their accuracy at no additional inference overhead. Extensive\nexperiments and ablation studies conducted on multiple benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed CAR can boost the accuracy of all baseline models\nby up to 2.23% mIOU with superior generalization ability.

Notably, deep learning can overcome many issues of\nmonocular vision, such as perceptual aliasing, low-textured areas, scale-drift,\nand degenerate motions. Also, concerning supervised learning, we can fully\nleverage video streams data without the need for depth or motion labels.\nHowever, in this work, we note that rotational motion can limit the accuracy of\nthe unsupervised pose networks more than the translational component.\nTherefore, we present RAUM-VO, an approach based on a model-free epipolar\nconstraint for frame-to-frame motion estimation (F2F) to adjust the rotation\nduring training and online inference. To this end, we match 2D keypoints\nbetween consecutive frames using pre-trained deep networks, Superpoint and\nSuperglue, while training a network for depth and pose estimation using an\nunsupervised training protocol.

The second principle, on the other hand, allows for the value\nfunction to be represented as a composition of multiple utility functions. This\ncan be leveraged for various purposes, e.g. dealing with highly varying reward\nscales, incorporating a priori knowledge about the sources of reward, and\nensemble learning. Combining the two principles yields a general blueprint for\ninstantiating convergent algorithms by orchestrating diverse mapping functions\nover multiple reward channels. This blueprint generalizes and subsumes\nalgorithms such as Q-Learning, Log Q-Learning, and Q-Decompose. In addition,\nour convergence proof for this general class relaxes certain required\nassumptions in some of these algorithms.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of finding optimal correlated equilibria of various\nsorts: normal-form coarse correlated equilibrium (NFCCE), extensive-form coarse\ncorrelated equilibrium (EFCCE), and extensive-form correlated equilibrium\n(EFCE). This is NP-hard in the general case and has been studied in special\ncases, most notably triangle-free games, which include all two-player games\nwith public chance moves. However, the general case is not well understood, and\nalgorithms usually scale poorly. First, we introduce the correlation DAG, a\nrepresentation of the space of correlated strategies whose size is dependent on\nthe specific solution concept. It extends the team belief DAG of Zhang et al.\nto general-sum games. For each of the three solution concepts, its size depends\nexponentially only on a parameter related to the game's information structure.\nWe also prove a fundamental complexity gap: while our size bounds for NFCCE are\nsimilar to those achieved in the case of team games by Zhang et al., this is\nimpossible to achieve for the other two concepts under standard complexity\nassumptions. Second, we propose a two-sided column generation approach to\ncompute optimal correlated strategies. Our algorithm improves upon the\none-sided approach of Farina et al. by means of a new decomposition of\ncorrelated strategies which allows players to re-optimize their sequence-form\nstrategies with respect to correlation plans which were previously added to the\nsupport. Our techniques outperform the prior state of the art for computing\noptimal general-sum correlated equilibria. For team games, the two-sided column\ngeneration approach vastly outperforms standard column generation approaches,\nmaking it the state of the art algorithm when the parameter is large. Along the\nway we also introduce two new benchmark games: a trick-taking game that\nemulates the endgame phase of the card game bridge, and a ride-sharing game.",

Qubits exploit the quantum physics\nproprieties to increase the parallelism and speed of computation.\nUnfortunately, besides being intrinsically noisy, qubits have also been shown\nto be highly susceptible to external sources of faults, such as ionizing\nradiation. The latest discoveries highlight a much higher radiation sensitivity\nof qubits than traditional transistors and identify a much more complex fault\nmodel than bit-flip. We propose a framework to identify the quantum circuits\nsensitivity to radiation-induced faults and the probability for a fault in a\nqubit to propagate to the output. Based on the latest studies and radiation\nexperiments performed on real quantum machines, we model the transient faults\nin a qubit as a phase shift with a parametrized magnitude. Additionally, our\nframework can inject multiple qubit faults, tuning the phase shift magnitude\nbased on the proximity of the qubit to the particle strike location. As we show\nin the paper, the proposed fault injector is highly flexible, and it can be\nused on both quantum circuit simulators and real quantum machines. We report\nthe finding of more than 285M injections on the Qiskit simulator and 53K\ninjections on real IBM machines. We consider three quantum algorithms and\nidentify the faults and qubits that are more likely to impact the output.

However, existing works\nfocus on parsing either the objects (e.g. cars and pedestrians) or scenes (e.g.\ntrees and buildings) from the LiDAR sensor. In this work, we address the task\nof LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, which aims to parse both objects and\nscenes in a unified manner. As one of the first endeavors towards this new\nchallenging task, we propose the Dynamic Shifting Network (DS-Net), which\nserves as an effective panoptic segmentation framework in the point cloud\nrealm. In particular, DS-Net has three appealing properties: 1) Strong backbone\ndesign. DS-Net adopts the cylinder convolution that is specifically designed\nfor LiDAR point clouds. 2) Dynamic Shifting for complex point distributions. We\nobserve that commonly-used clustering algorithms are incapable of handling\ncomplex autonomous driving scenes with non-uniform point cloud distributions\nand varying instance sizes. Thus, we present an efficient learnable clustering\nmodule, dynamic shifting, which adapts kernel functions on the fly for\ndifferent instances. 3) Extension to 4D prediction. Furthermore, we extend\nDS-Net to 4D panoptic LiDAR segmentation by the temporally unified instance\nclustering on aligned LiDAR frames. To comprehensively evaluate the performance\nof LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, we construct and curate benchmarks from\ntwo large-scale autonomous driving LiDAR datasets, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DS-Net achieves superior\naccuracies over current state-of-the-art methods in both tasks.

We focused on\nhomepages and vaccine pages in 49 states. For this study, we used the automated\nAChecker tool to assess conformance to the WCAG 2.0 guidelines at A, AA and AAA\nlevels of conformance, and conformance with the Section 508c standard. We also\nmanually rated, on a scale 0 (none) to 3 (highest), the specific accessibility\nfeatures, if any, that web developers had included on the pages. We found that\naccessibility violations were prevalent across states but to varying degrees\nfor a specific accessibility criterion.

    "abstract": "When dealing with binary classification of data with only one labeled class\ndata scientists employ two main approaches, namely One-Class (OC)\nclassification and Positive Unlabeled (PU) learning. The former only learns\nfrom labeled positive data, whereas the latter also utilizes unlabeled data to\nimprove the overall performance. Since PU learning utilizes more data, we might\nbe prone to think that when unlabeled data is available, the go-to algorithms\nshould always come from the PU group. However, we find that this is not always\nthe case if unlabeled data is unreliable, i.e. contains limited or biased\nlatent negative data. We perform an extensive experimental study of a wide list\nof state-of-the-art OC and PU algorithms in various scenarios as far as\nunlabeled data reliability is concerned. Furthermore, we propose PU\nmodifications of state-of-the-art OC algorithms that are robust to unreliable\nunlabeled data, as well as a guideline to similarly modify other OC algorithms.\nOur main practical recommendation is to use state-of-the-art PU algorithms when\nunlabeled data is reliable and to use the proposed modifications of\nstate-of-the-art OC algorithms otherwise. Additionally, we outline procedures\nto distinguish the cases of reliable and unreliable unlabeled data using\nstatistical tests.",

    "abstract": "The olive oil sector produces a substantial impact in the Mediterranean's\neconomy and lifestyle. Many studies exist which try to optimize the different\nsteps in the olive oil's production process. One of the main challenges for\nolive oil producers is the ability to asses and control the quality during the\nproduction cycle. For this purpose, several parameters need to be determined,\nsuch as the acidity, the UV absorption or the ethyl esters content. To achieve\nthis, samples must be sent to an approved laboratory for chemical analysis.\nThis approach is expensive and cannot be performed very frequently, making\nquality control of olive oil a real challenge. This work explores a new\napproach based on fluorescence spectroscopy and artificial intelligence\n(namely, 1-D convolutional neural networks) to predict the five chemical\nquality indicators of olive oil (acidity, peroxide value, UV spectroscopic\nparameters $K_{270}$ and $K_{232}$, and ethyl esters) from simple fluorescence\nspectra. Fluorescence spectroscopy is a very attractive optical technique since\nit does not require sample preparation, is non destructive, and, as shown in\nthis work, can be easily implemented in small and cost-effective sensors. The\nresults indicate that the proposed approach gives exceptional results in the\nquality determination and would make the continuous quality control of olive\noil during and after the production process a reality. Additionally, this novel\nmethodology presents potential applications as a support for quality\nspecifications of olive oil, as defined by the European regulation.",

Accounting for frequency stability\nrequirements and allocating proper spinning reserves, therefore becomes a topic\nof pivotal importance in the long-term planning and operational management of\npower systems.

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with only image-level\nsupervision is a challenging task. Most existing methods exploit Class\nActivation Maps (CAM) to generate pixel-level pseudo labels for supervised\ntraining. However, due to the local receptive field of Convolution Neural\nNetworks (CNN), CAM applied to CNNs often suffers from partial activation --\nhighlighting the most discriminative part instead of the entire object area. In\norder to capture both local features and global representations, the Conformer\nhas been proposed to combine a visual transformer branch with a CNN branch. In\nthis paper, we propose TransCAM, a Conformer-based solution to WSSS that\nexplicitly leverages the attention weights from the transformer branch of the\nConformer to refine the CAM generated from the CNN branch. TransCAM is\nmotivated by our observation that attention weights from shallow transformer\nblocks are able to capture low-level spatial feature similarities while\nattention weights from deep transformer blocks capture high-level semantic\ncontext. Despite its simplicity, TransCAM achieves a new state-of-the-art\nperformance of 69.3% and 69.6% on the respective PASCAL VOC 2012 validation and\ntest sets, showing the effectiveness of transformer attention-based refinement\nof CAM for WSSS.",

Some methods proposed the adaptation of CNNs to ultra-wide\nFoV images by learning deformable kernels.

FisheyeHDK is a hybrid CNN\narchitecture combining hyperbolic and Euclidean convolution layers for\npositions and features learning. First, we provide an intuition of hyperbolic\nspace for wide FoV images. Using synthetic distortion profiles, we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach.

    "abstract": "Pre-trained Transformer-based language models have become a key building\nblock for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. While these models are\nextremely accurate, they can be too large and computationally intensive to run\non standard deployments. A variety of compression methods, including\ndistillation, quantization, structured and unstructured pruning are known to be\napplicable to decrease model size and increase inference speed. In this\ncontext, this paper's contributions are two-fold. We begin with an in-depth\nstudy of the accuracy-compression trade-off for unstructured weight pruning in\nthe context of BERT models, and introduce Optimal BERT Surgeon (O-BERT-S), an\nefficient and accurate weight pruning method based on approximate second-order\ninformation, which we show to yield state-of-the-art results in terms of the\ncompression/accuracy trade-off. Specifically, Optimal BERT Surgeon extends\nexisting work on second-order pruning by allowing for pruning blocks of\nweights, and by being applicable at BERT scale. Second, we investigate the\nimpact of this pruning method when compounding compression approaches for\nTransformer-based models, which allows us to combine state-of-the-art\nstructured and unstructured pruning together with quantization, in order to\nobtain highly compressed, but accurate models. The resulting compression\nframework is powerful, yet general and efficient: we apply it to both the\nfine-tuning and pre-training stages of language tasks, to obtain\nstate-of-the-art results on the accuracy-compression trade-off with relatively\nsimple compression recipes. For example, we obtain 10x model size compression\nwith < 1% relative drop in accuracy to the dense BERT-base, 10x end-to-end\nCPU-inference speedup with < 2% relative drop in accuracy, and 29x inference\nspeedups with < 7.5% relative accuracy drop.",

Compared to\nother recent developments in the literature, the presented approach has the\nsignificant advantage of tracking the position and orientation of a railway\nvehicle using inertial sensors only, excluding global position sensors (GNSS or\ntotal station) and also excluding global orientation sensors (magnetometers or\ninclinometers). The algorithm is based on a kinematic model of the relative\nmotion of the body with respect to the track. This kinematic model is used as\nthe system equations of a Kalman filter algorithm that includes in the state\nvector the coordinates used to define the position and orientation of the body.\nTwo different Kalman filter approaches are described. In the first one, the\nposition and orientation are calculated independently. In the second one, both\nposition and orientation are calculated as a coupled problem. Crucial to the\nsuccess of the results of the Kalman filters is the use of the correct\ncovariance matrices associated with the system process and the measurements.\nThe calculated trajectory and orientation are applied in this research to the\nproblem of track geometry measurement. A scale track with known design geometry\nand irregularities is used to conduct experiments for tuning and evaluating the\nquality of the output of the algorithm. Results show that the developed\nalgorithm is accurate enough for this application.

    "abstract": "We study fair allocation of indivisible goods and chores among agents with\n\\emph{lexicographic} preferences -- a subclass of additive valuations. In sharp\ncontrast to the goods-only setting, we show that an allocation satisfying\n\\emph{envy-freeness up to any item} (EFX) could fail to exist for a mixture of\n\\emph{objective} goods and chores. To our knowledge, this negative result\nprovides the \\emph{first} counterexample for EFX over (any subdomain of)\nadditive valuations. To complement this non-existence result, we identify a\nclass of instances with (possibly subjective) mixed items where an EFX and\nPareto optimal allocation always exists and can be efficiently computed. When\nthe fairness requirement is relaxed to \\emph{maximin share} (MMS), we show\npositive existence and computation for \\emph{any} mixed instance. More broadly,\nour work examines the existence and computation of fair and efficient\nallocations both for mixed items as well as chores-only instances, and\nhighlights the additional difficulty of these problems vis-{\\`a}-vis their\ngoods-only counterparts.",

    "title": "On Cyclic Solutions to the Min-Max Latency Multi-Robot Patrolling  Problem",
    "abstract": "We consider the following surveillance problem: Given a set $P$ of $n$ sites\nin a metric space and a set of $k$ robots with the same maximum speed, compute\na patrol schedule of minimum latency for the robots. Here a patrol schedule\nspecifies for each robot an infinite sequence of sites to visit (in the given\norder) and the latency $L$ of a schedule is the maximum latency of any site,\nwhere the latency of a site $s$ is the supremum of the lengths of the time\nintervals between consecutive visits to $s$. When $k=1$ the problem is\nequivalent to the travelling salesman problem (TSP) and thus it is NP-hard. We\nhave two main results. We consider cyclic solutions in which the set of sites\nmust be partitioned into $\\ell$ groups, for some~$\\ell \\leq k$, and each group\nis assigned a subset of the robots that move along the travelling salesman tour\nof the group at equal distance from each other. Our first main result is that\napproximating the optimal latency of the class of cyclic solutions can be\nreduced to approximating the optimal travelling salesman tour on some input,\nwith only a $1+\\varepsilon$ factor loss in the approximation factor and an\n$O\\left(\\left( k/\\varepsilon \\right)^k\\right)$ factor loss in the runtime, for\nany $\\varepsilon >0$. Our second main result shows that an optimal cyclic\nsolution is a $2(1-1/k)$-approximation of the overall optimal solution. Note\nthat for $k=2$ this implies that an optimal cyclic solution is optimal overall.\nThe results have a number of consequences. For the Euclidean version of the\nproblem, for instance, combining our results with known results on Euclidean\nTSP, yields a PTAS for approximating an optimal cyclic solution, and it yields\na $(2(1-1/k)+\\varepsilon)$-approximation of the optimal unrestricted solution.\nIf the conjecture mentioned above is true, then our algorithm is actually a\nPTAS for the general problem in the Euclidean setting.",

    "abstract": "Providing natural language instructions in prompts is a useful new paradigm\nfor improving task performance of large language models in a zero-shot setting.\nRecent work has aimed to improve such prompts via manual rewriting or\ngradient-based tuning. However, manual rewriting is time-consuming and requires\nsubjective interpretation, while gradient-based tuning can be extremely\ncomputationally demanding for large models and requires full access to model\nweights, which may not be available for API-based models. In this work, we\nintroduce Gradient-free Instructional Prompt Search (GrIPS), a gradient-free,\nedit-based search approach for improving task instructions for large language\nmodels. GrIPS takes in instructions designed for humans and automatically\nreturns an improved, edited prompt, while allowing for API-based tuning. The\ninstructions in our search are iteratively edited using four operations\n(delete, add, swap, paraphrase) on text at the phrase-level. With InstructGPT\nmodels, GrIPS improves the average task performance by up to 4.30 percentage\npoints on eight classification tasks from the Natural-Instructions dataset. We\nsee improvements for both instruction-only prompts and for k-shot\nexample+instruction prompts. Notably, GrIPS outperforms manual rewriting\nfollowing the guidelines in Mishra et al. (2022) and also outperforms purely\nexample-based prompts while controlling for the available compute and data\nbudget. Lastly, we provide qualitative analysis of the edited instructions\nacross several scales of GPT models. Our code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/archiki/GrIPS",

Currently, the\nfluid-based sensors have struck the right balance of anthropomorphic sizes and\nshapes and accuracy of tactile response measurement. However, this design is\nplagued by a low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) due to the fluid based sensing\nmechanism \"damping\" the measurement values that are hard to model. To this end,\nwe present a spatio-temporal gradient representation on the data obtained from\nfluid-based tactile sensors, which is inspired from neuromorphic principles of\nevent based sensing. We present a novel algorithm (GradTac) that converts\ndiscrete data points from spatial tactile sensors into spatio-temporal surfaces\nand tracks tactile contours across these surfaces. Processing the tactile data\nusing the proposed spatio-temporal domain is robust, makes it less susceptible\nto the inherent noise from the fluid based sensors, and allows accurate\ntracking of regions of touch as compared to using the raw data. We successfully\nevaluate and demonstrate the efficacy of GradTac on many real-world experiments\nperformed using the Shadow Dexterous Hand, equipped with the BioTac SP sensors.\nSpecifically, we use it for tracking tactile input across the sensor's surface,\nmeasuring relative forces, detecting linear and rotational slip, and for edge\ntracking.

Recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) trained on natural images have\nbeen proposed as compelling models of human vision based on reports that they\nlearn internal representations similar to the primate ventral visual stream and\nshow similar patterns of errors in object classification tasks. That is, DNNs\noften perform well on brain and behavioral benchmarks. Here we compared human\nand DNN responses in discrimination judgments that assess a range of Gestalt\norganization principles (Pomerantz et al., 1977; Pomerantz and Portillo, 2011).\nAmongst the DNNs tested we selected models that perform well on the Brain-Score\nbenchmark (Schrimpf et al., 2018). We found that network trained on natural\nimages exhibited sensitivity to shapes at the last stage of classification,\nwhich in some cases matched humans responses. When shape familiarity was\ncontrolled for (by using dot patterns that would not resemble shapes) we found\nthe networks were insensitive to the standard Gestalt principles of proximity,\norientation, and linearity, which have been shown to have a strong and robust\neffect on humans.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a microscopic agent-based pedestrian behavior model\nIntend-Wait-Cross. The model is comprised of rules representing behaviors of\npedestrians as a series of decisions that depend on their individual\ncharacteristics (e.g. demographics, walking speed, law obedience) and\nenvironmental conditions (e.g. traffic flow, road structure). The model's main\nfocus is on generating realistic crossing decision-model, which incorporates an\nimproved formulation of time-to-collision (TTC) computation accounting for\ncontext, vehicle dynamics, and perceptual noise.\nOur model generates a diverse population of agents acting in a highly\nconfigurable environment. All model components, including individual\ncharacteristics of pedestrians, types of decisions they make, and environmental\nfactors, are motivated by studies on pedestrian traffic behavior. Model\nparameters are calibrated using a combination of naturalistic driving data and\nestimates from the literature to maximize the realism of the simulated\nbehaviors. A number of experiments validate various aspects of the model, such\nas pedestrian crossing patterns, and individual characteristics of pedestrians.",

    "abstract": "We apply state-of-the-art computational geometry methods to the problem of\nreconstructing a time-varying sea surface from tide gauge records. Our work\nbuilds on a recent article by Nitzke et al.~(Computers \\& Geosciences,\n157:104920, 2021) who have suggested to learn a triangulation $D$ of a given\nset of tide gauge stations. The objective is to minimize the misfit of the\npiecewise linear surface induced by $D$ to a reference surface that has been\nacquired with satellite altimetry. The authors restricted their search to\nk-order Delaunay ($k$-OD) triangulations and used an integer linear program in\norder to solve the resulting optimization problem.\nIn geometric terms, the input to our problem consists of two sets of points\nin $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with elevations: a set $\\mathcal{S}$ that is to be\ntriangulated, and a set $\\mathcal{R}$ of reference points. Intuitively, we\ndefine the error of a triangulation as the average vertical distance of a point\nin $\\mathcal{R}$ to the triangulated surface that is obtained by interpolating\nelevations of $\\mathcal{S}$ linearly in each triangle. Our goal is to find the\ntriangulation of $\\mathcal{S}$ that has minimum error with respect to\n$\\mathcal{R}$.\nIn our work, we prove that the minimum-error triangulation problem is NP-hard\nand cannot be approximated within any multiplicative factor in polynomial time\nunless $P=NP$. At the same time we show that the problem instances that occur\nin our application (considering sea level data from several hundreds of tide\ngauge stations worldwide) can be solved relatively fast using dynamic\nprogramming when restricted to $k$-OD triangulations for $k\\le 7$. In\nparticular, instances for which the number of connected components of the\nso-called $k$-OD fixed-edge graph is small can be solved within few seconds.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) framework that can\nexploit both short-term dynamics and long-term temporal consistency to detect\ncamouflaged objects from video frames. An essential property of camouflaged\nobjects is that they usually exhibit patterns similar to the background and\nthus make them hard to identify from still images. Therefore, effectively\nhandling temporal dynamics in videos becomes the key for the VCOD task as the\ncamouflaged objects will be noticeable when they move. However, current VCOD\nmethods often leverage homography or optical flows to represent motions, where\nthe detection error may accumulate from both the motion estimation error and\nthe segmentation error. On the other hand, our method unifies motion estimation\nand object segmentation within a single optimization framework. Specifically,\nwe build a dense correlation volume to implicitly capture motions between\nneighbouring frames and utilize the final segmentation supervision to optimize\nthe implicit motion estimation and segmentation jointly. Furthermore, to\nenforce temporal consistency within a video sequence, we jointly utilize a\nspatio-temporal transformer to refine the short-term predictions. Extensive\nexperiments on VCOD benchmarks demonstrate the architectural effectiveness of\nour approach. We also provide a large-scale VCOD dataset named MoCA-Mask with\npixel-level handcrafted ground-truth masks and construct a comprehensive VCOD\nbenchmark with previous methods to facilitate research in this direction.\nDataset Link: https://xueliancheng.github.io/SLT-Net-project.",

    "abstract": "We propose a method for identifying an ectopic activation in the heart\nnon-invasively. Ectopic activity in the heart can trigger deadly arrhythmias.\nThe localization of the ectopic foci or earliest activation sites (EASs) is\ntherefore a critical information for cardiologists in deciding the optimal\ntreatment. In this work, we formulate the identification problem as a global\noptimization problem, by minimizing the mismatch between the ECG predicted by a\ncardiac model, when paced at a given EAS, and the observed ECG during the\nectopic activity. Our cardiac model amounts at solving an anisotropic eikonal\nequation for cardiac activation and the forward bidomain model in the torso\nwith the lead field approach for computing the ECG. We build a Gaussian process\nsurrogate model of the loss function on the heart surface to perform Bayesian\noptimization. In this procedure, we iteratively evaluate the loss function\nfollowing the lower confidence bound criterion, which combines exploring the\nsurface with exploitation of the minimum region. We also extend this framework\nto incorporate multiple levels of fidelity of the model. We show that our\nprocedure converges to the minimum only after $11.7\\pm10.4$ iterations (20\nindependent runs) for the single-fidelity case and $3.5\\pm1.7$ iterations for\nthe multi-fidelity case.

    "abstract": "In recent years, various vendors have made quantum software frameworks\navailable. Yet with vendor-specific frameworks, code portability seems at risk,\nespecially in a field where hardware and software libraries have not yet\nreached a consolidated state, and even foundational aspects of the technologies\nare still in flux. Accordingly, the development of vendor-independent quantum\nprogramming languages and frameworks is often suggested. This follows the\nestablished architectural pattern of introducing additional levels of\nabstraction into software stacks, thereby piling on layers of abstraction. Yet\nsoftware architecture also provides seemingly less abstract alternatives,\nnamely to focus on hardware-specific formulations of problems that peel off\nunnecessary layers. In this article, we quantitatively and experimentally\nexplore these strategic alternatives, and compare popular quantum frameworks\nfrom the software implementation perspective. We find that for several\nspecific, yet generalisable problems, the mathematical formulation of the\nproblem to be solved is not just sufficiently abstract and serves as precise\ndescription, but is likewise concrete enough to allow for deriving\nframework-specific implementations with little effort. Additionally, we argue,\nbased on analysing dozens of existing quantum codes, that porting between\nframeworks is actually low-effort, since the quantum- and framework-specific\nportions are very manageable in terms of size, commonly in the order of mere\nhundreds of lines of code. Given the current state-of-the-art in quantum\nprogramming practice, this leads us to argue in favour of peeling off\nunnecessary abstraction levels.",

Lacking prior knowledge of true anomalies is the\nmain reason for the limited application of previous anomaly detection methods,\nespecially in the medical image analysis realm. In this work, we propose a\none-shot anomaly detection framework, namely LesionPaste, that utilizes true\nanomalies from a single annotated sample and synthesizes artificial anomalous\nsamples for anomaly detection. First, a lesion bank is constructed by applying\naugmentation to randomly selected lesion patches.

Finally, a classification network is\ntrained using the synthetic abnormal samples and the true normal data.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on two publicly-available medical image\ndatasets with different types of abnormalities. On both datasets, our proposed\nLesionPaste largely outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised and\nsemi-supervised anomaly detection methods, and is on a par with the\nfully-supervised counterpart.

In this work, deep learning (DL)-based conditional\ninpainting is proposed to restore anatomically correct image information of\nartifact-affected areas. The restoration approach consists of a two-stage\nprocess: DL-based detection of common interpolation (INT) and double structure\n(DS) artifacts, followed by conditional inpainting applied to the artifact\nareas. In this context, conditional refers to a guidance of the inpainting\nprocess by patient-specific image data to ensure anatomically reliable results.\nEvaluation is based on 65 in-house 4D CT data sets of lung cancer patients (48\nwith only slight artifacts, 17 with pronounced artifacts) and the publicly\navailable DIRLab 4D CT data (independent external test set). Automated artifact\ndetection revealed a ROC-AUC of 0.99 for INT and 0.97 for DS artifacts\n(in-house data). The proposed inpainting method decreased the average root mean\nsquared error (RMSE) by 60% (DS) and 42% (INT) for the in-house evaluation data\n(simulated artifacts for the slight artifact data; original data were\nconsidered as ground truth for RMSE computation). For the external DIR-Lab\ndata, the RMSE decreased by 65% and 36%, respectively. Applied to the\npronounced artifact data group, on average 68% of the detectable artifacts were\nremoved. The results highlight the potential of DL-based inpainting for the\nrestoration of artifact-affected 4D CT data.

    "abstract": "The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is one of the most widely used statistical\nmodels for sequential data analysis, and it has been successfully applied in a\nlarge variety of domains. One of the key reasons for this versatility is the\nability of HMMs to deal with missing data. However, standard HMM learning\nalgorithms rely crucially on the assumption that the positions of the missing\nobservations within the observation sequence are known. In some situations\nwhere such assumptions are not feasible, a number of special algorithms have\nbeen developed. Currently, these algorithms rely strongly on specific\nstructural assumptions of the underlying chain, such as acyclicity, and are not\napplicable in the general case. In particular, there are numerous domains\nwithin medicine and computational biology, where the missing observation\nlocations are unknown and acyclicity assumptions do not hold, thus presenting a\nbarrier for the application of HMMs in those fields. In this paper we consider\na general problem of learning HMMs from data with unknown missing observation\nlocations (i.e., only the order of the non-missing observations are known).

    "title": "Change Detection from Synthetic Aperture Radar Images via Dual Path  Denoising Network",
    "abstract": "Benefited from the rapid and sustainable development of synthetic aperture\nradar (SAR) sensors, change detection from SAR images has received increasing\nattentions over the past few years. Existing unsupervised deep learning-based\nmethods have made great efforts to exploit robust feature representations, but\nthey consume much time to optimize parameters. Besides, these methods use\nclustering to obtain pseudo-labels for training, and the pseudo-labeled samples\noften involve errors, which can be considered as \"label noise\". To address\nthese issues, we propose a Dual Path Denoising Network (DPDNet) for SAR image\nchange detection. In particular, we introduce the random label propagation to\nclean the label noise involved in preclassification. We also propose the\ndistinctive patch convolution for feature representation learning to reduce the\ntime consumption. Specifically, the attention mechanism is used to select\ndistinctive pixels in the feature maps, and patches around these pixels are\nselected as convolution kernels. Consequently, the DPDNet does not require a\ngreat number of training samples for parameter optimization, and its\ncomputational efficiency is greatly enhanced. Extensive experiments have been\nconducted on five SAR datasets to verify the proposed DPDNet. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art\nmethods in change detection results.",

    "abstract": "One of the essential elements in implementing a closed-loop irrigation system\nis soil moisture estimation based on a limited number of available sensors. One\nassociated problem is the determination of the optimal locations to install the\nsensors such that good soil moisture estimation can be obtained. In our\nprevious work, the modal degree of observability was employed to address the\nproblem of optimal sensor placement for soil moisture estimation of\nagro-hydrological systems. It was demonstrated that the optimally placed\nsensors can improve the soil moisture estimation performance. However, it is\nunclear whether the optimal sensor placement can significantly improve the soil\nmoisture estimation performance in actual applications. In this work, we\ninvestigate the impact of sensor placement in soil moisture estimation for an\nactual agricultural field in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. In an experiment on\nthe studied field, 42 soil moisture sensors were installed at different depths\nto collect the soil moisture measurements for one growing season. A\nthree-dimensional agro-hydrological model with heterogeneous soil parameters of\nthe studied field is developed. The modal degree of observability is applied to\nthe three-dimensional system to determine the optimal sensor locations. The\nextended Kalman filter (EKF) is chosen as the data assimilation tool to\nestimate the soil moisture content of the studied field. Soil moisture\nestimation results for different scenarios are obtained and analyzed to\ninvestigate the effects of sensor placement on the performance of soil moisture\nestimation in the actual applications.",

Since group\ninteractions are common in social, biological, and technological systems,\nhigher-order networks have recently led to important new discoveries across\nmany fields of research. We here review these works, focusing in particular on\nthe novel aspects of the dynamics that emerges on higher-order networks.

Furthermore, there are studies that indicate that the Empty Pack Surveys\n(EPS) ordered by the TTCs are oversized. The novelty of this study is that, in\naddition to detecting the anomalies analyzed in the EPSs, there are provinces\nin which cigarette sales are higher than reasonable values, something that the\nTTCs ignore. This study analyzed simultaneously, firstly, if the EPSs\nestablished in each of the 47 Spanish provinces were fulfilled. Second,\nanomalies observed in provinces where sales exceed expected values are\nmeasured. To achieve the objective of the paper, provincial data on cigarette\nsales, price and GDP per capita are used. These data are modeled with machine\nlearning techniques widely used to detect anomalies in other areas. The results\nreveal that the provinces in which sales below reasonable values are observed\n(as detected by the EPSs) present a clear geographical pattern. Furthermore,\nthe values provided by the EPSs in Spain, as indicated in the previous\nliterature, are slightly oversized. Finally, there are regions bordering other\ncountries or with a high tourist influence in which the observed sales are\nhigher than the expected values.",

While recent machine learning methods for MRI reconstruction\nand analysis have shown promise for reducing this burden, these techniques are\nprimarily validated with imperfect image quality metrics, which are discordant\nwith clinically-relevant measures that ultimately hamper clinical deployment\nand clinician trust. To mitigate this challenge, we present the Stanford Knee\nMRI with Multi-Task Evaluation (SKM-TEA) dataset, a collection of quantitative\nknee MRI (qMRI) scans that enables end-to-end, clinically-relevant evaluation\nof MRI reconstruction and analysis tools. This 1.6TB dataset consists of\nraw-data measurements of ~25,000 slices (155 patients) of anonymized patient\nMRI scans, the corresponding scanner-generated DICOM images, manual\nsegmentations of four tissues, and bounding box annotations for sixteen\nclinically relevant pathologies. We provide a framework for using qMRI\nparameter maps, along with image reconstructions and dense image labels, for\nmeasuring the quality of qMRI biomarker estimates extracted from MRI\nreconstruction, segmentation, and detection techniques. Finally, we use this\nframework to benchmark state-of-the-art baselines on this dataset.

    "title": "Topological EEG Nonlinear Dynamics Analysis for Emotion Recognition",
    "abstract": "Emotional recognition through exploring the electroencephalography (EEG)\ncharacteristics has been widely performed in recent studies. Nonlinear analysis\nand feature extraction methods for understanding the complex dynamical\nphenomena are associated with the EEG patterns of different emotions. The phase\nspace reconstruction is a typical nonlinear technique to reveal the dynamics of\nthe brain neural system. Recently, the topological data analysis (TDA) scheme\nhas been used to explore the properties of space, which provides a powerful\ntool to think over the phase space. In this work, we proposed a topological EEG\nnonlinear dynamics analysis approach using the phase space reconstruction (PSR)\ntechnique to convert EEG time series into phase space, and the persistent\nhomology tool explores the topological properties of the phase space. We\nperform the topological analysis of EEG signals in different rhythm bands to\nbuild emotion feature vectors, which shows high distinguishing ability. We\nevaluate the approach with two well-known benchmark datasets, the DEAP and\nDREAMER datasets. The recognition results achieved accuracies of 99.37% and\n99.35% in arousal and valence classification tasks with DEAP, and 99.96%,\n99.93%, and 99.95% in arousal, valence, and dominance classifications tasks\nwith DREAMER, respectively. The performances are supposed to be outperformed\ncurrent state-of-art approaches in DREAMER (improved by 1% to 10% depends on\ntemporal length), while comparable to other related works evaluated in DEAP.\nThe proposed work is the first investigation in the emotion recognition\noriented EEG topological feature analysis, which brought a novel insight into\nthe brain neural system nonlinear dynamics analysis and feature extraction.",

    "abstract": "Contrast-enhanced T1 (T1ce) is one of the most essential magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) modalities for diagnosing and analyzing brain tumors, especially\ngliomas. In clinical practice, common MRI modalities such as T1, T2, and fluid\nattenuation inversion recovery are relatively easy to access while T1ce is more\nchallenging considering the additional cost and potential risk of allergies to\nthe contrast agent. Therefore, it is of great clinical necessity to develop a\nmethod to synthesize T1ce from other common modalities. Current paired image\ntranslation methods typically have the issue of requiring a large amount of\npaired data and do not focus on specific regions of interest, e.g., the tumor\nregion, in the synthesization process. To address these issues, we propose a\nDifficulty-perceived common-to-T1ce Semi-Supervised multimodal MRI Synthesis\nnetwork (DS3-Net), involving both paired and unpaired data together with\ndual-level knowledge distillation. DS3-Net predicts a difficulty map to\nprogressively promote the synthesis task. Specifically, a pixelwise constraint\nand a patchwise contrastive constraint are guided by the predicted difficulty\nmap. Through extensive experiments on the publiclyavailable BraTS2020 dataset,\nDS3-Net outperforms its supervised counterpart in each respect. Furthermore,\nwith only 5% paired data, the proposed DS3-Net achieves competitive performance\nwith state-of-theart image translation methods utilizing 100% paired data,\ndelivering an average SSIM of 0.8947 and an average PSNR of 23.60.",

    "abstract": "The Gaussian Process Convolution Model (GPCM; Tobar et al., 2015a) is a model\nfor signals with complex spectral structure. A significant limitation of the\nGPCM is that it assumes a rapidly decaying spectrum: it can only model smooth\nsignals. Moreover, inference in the GPCM currently requires (1) a mean-field\nassumption, resulting in poorly calibrated uncertainties, and (2) a tedious\nvariational optimisation of large covariance matrices. We redesign the GPCM\nmodel to induce a richer distribution over the spectrum with relaxed\nassumptions about smoothness: the Causal Gaussian Process Convolution Model\n(CGPCM) introduces a causality assumption into the GPCM, and the Rough Gaussian\nProcess Convolution Model (RGPCM) can be interpreted as a Bayesian\nnonparametric generalisation of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We\nalso propose a more effective variational inference scheme, going beyond the\nmean-field assumption: we design a Gibbs sampler which directly samples from\nthe optimal variational solution, circumventing any variational optimisation\nentirely. The proposed variations of the GPCM are validated in experiments on\nsynthetic and real-world data, showing promising results.",

AR is expected to be generally adopted in\ntwo to three years in higher education and four to five years in K to 12.\nApplying AR technology in the education sector especially in STEM subjects, can\nresult in having a smart campus. In adopting a SMART Campus strategy, education\npractitioners must address many intrinsic issues in science, technology,\nengineering, and mathematics (STEM) research. For example, in physics, there\nare expensive or insufficient laboratory systems, system faults, and difficulty\nsimulating other experimental circumstances. In technology, many schools do not\nhave enough computers. In engineering, there are only a few instructors who are\nknowledgeable in computer aided design (CAD). In mathematics, few teachers\nincorporate technology into their lessons often because they believe it is\nstill better to teach through the traditional methods. Hence, In this paper we\ndiscuss how AR is being used now in different learning areas in STEM to open\nnew doors to researchers and teachers as they transition their schools into\nSMART campuses with the use of AR apps. Aligned with this, a suggested\nframework for school administrators and policymakers is proposed based on a\nreview of the positive benefits of different AR apps.",

The ability to classify such\nmanifolds is of interest, as object recognition and other computational tasks\nrequire a response that is insensitive to variability within a manifold. Linear\nclassification of object manifolds was previously studied for max-margin\nclassifiers. Soft-margin classifiers are a larger class of algorithms and\nprovide an additional regularization parameter used in applications to optimize\nperformance outside the training set by balancing between making fewer training\nerrors and learning more robust classifiers. Here we develop a mean-field\ntheory describing the behavior of soft-margin classifiers applied to object\nmanifolds. Analyzing manifolds with increasing complexity, from points through\nspheres to general manifolds, a mean-field theory describes the expected value\nof the linear classifier's norm, as well as the distribution of fields and\nslack variables. By analyzing the robustness of the learned classification to\nnoise, we can predict the probability of classification errors and their\ndependence on regularization, demonstrating a finite optimal choice. The theory\ndescribes a previously unknown phase transition, corresponding to the\ndisappearance of a non-trivial solution, thus providing a soft version of the\nwell-known classification capacity of max-margin classifiers.",

    "title": "A Supervised Learning Approach to Rankability",
    "abstract": "The rankability of data is a recently proposed problem that considers the\nability of a dataset, represented as a graph, to produce a meaningful ranking\nof the items it contains. To study this concept, a number of rankability\nmeasures have recently been proposed, based on comparisons to a complete\ndominance graph via combinatorial and linear algebraic methods. In this paper,\nwe review these measures and highlight some questions to which they give rise\nbefore going on to propose new methods to assess rankability, which are\namenable to efficient estimation. Finally, we compare these measures by\napplying them to both synthetic and real-life sports data.",
