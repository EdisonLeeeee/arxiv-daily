    "abstract": "The large availability of datasets fosters the use of \\acrshort{ml} and\n\\acrshort{ai} technologies to gather insights, study trends, and predict unseen\nbehaviours out of the world of data. Today, gathering and integrating data from\ndifferent sources is mainly a manual activity that requires the knowledge of\nexpert users at an high cost in terms of both time and money. It is, therefore,\nnecessary to make the process of gathering and linking data from many different\nsources affordable to make datasets ready to perform the desired analysis. In\nthis work, we propose the development of a comprehensive framework, named\nSemTUI, to make the enrichment process flexible, complete, and effective\nthrough the use of semantics. The approach is to promote fast integration of\nexternal services to perform enrichment tasks such as reconciliation and\nextension; and to provide users with a graphical interface to support\nadditional tasks, such as refinement to correct ambiguous results provided by\nautomatic enrichment algorithms. A task-driven user evaluation proved SemTUI to\nbe understandable, usable, and capable of achieving table enrichment with\nlittle effort and time with user tests that involved people with different\nskills and experiences.",

    "title": "Human Gait Analysis using Gait Energy Image",
    "abstract": "Gait recognition is one of the most recent emerging techniques of human\nbiometric which can be used for security based purposes having unobtrusive\nlearning method. In comparison with other bio-metrics gait analysis has some\nspecial security features. Most of the biometric technique uses sequential\ntemplate based component analysis for recognition. Comparing with those\nmethods, we proposed a developed technique for gait identification using the\nfeature Gait Energy Image (GEI). GEI representation of gait contains all\ninformation of each image in one gait cycle and requires less storage and low\nprocessing speed. As only one image is enough to store the necessary\ninformation in GEI feature recognition process is very easier than any other\nfeature for gait recognition. Gait recognition has some limitations in\nrecognition process like viewing angle variation, walking speed, clothes,\ncarrying load etc. Our proposed method in the paper compares the recognition\nperformance with template based feature extraction which needs to process each\nframe in the cycle. We use GEI which gives relatively all information about all\nthe frames in the cycle and results in better performance than other feature of\ngait analysis.",

    "abstract": "Few-shot semantic segmentation aims at recognizing the object regions of\nunseen categories with only a few annotated examples as supervision. The key to\nfew-shot segmentation is to establish a robust semantic relationship between\nthe support and query images and to prevent overfitting. In this paper, we\npropose an effective Multi-similarity Hyperrelation Network (MSHNet) to tackle\nthe few-shot semantic segmentation problem. In MSHNet, we propose a new\nGenerative Prototype Similarity (GPS), which together with cosine similarity\ncan establish a strong semantic relation between the support and query images.\nThe locally generated prototype similarity based on global feature is logically\ncomplementary to the global cosine similarity based on local feature, and the\nrelationship between the query image and the supported image can be expressed\nmore comprehensively by using the two similarities simultaneously. In addition,\nwe propose a Symmetric Merging Block (SMB) in MSHNet to efficiently merge\nmulti-layer, multi-shot and multi-similarity hyperrelational features. MSHNet\nis built on the basis of similarity rather than specific category features,\nwhich can achieve more general unity and effectively reduce overfitting.

A recent study FedE first proposes an FL framework that shares\nentity embeddings of KGs across all clients.

Specifically, the known entity embedding can be used to infer\nwhether a specific relation between two entities exists in a private client.

    "abstract": "In recent years, providing incentives to human users for attracting their\nattention and engagement has been widely adopted in many applications. To\neffectively incentivize users, most incentive mechanisms determine incentive\nvalues based on users' individual attributes, such as preferences. These\napproaches could be ineffective when such information is unavailable.\nMeanwhile, due to the budget limitation, the number of users who can be\nincentivized is also restricted. In this light, we intend to utilize social\ninfluence among users to maximize the incentivization. By directly\nincentivizing influential users in the social network, their followers and\nfriends could be indirectly incentivized with fewer incentives or no incentive.\nHowever, it is difficult to identify influential users beforehand in the social\nnetwork, as the influence strength between each pair of users is typically\nunknown. In this work, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning-based\nframework, named Geometric Actor-Critic (GAC), to discover effective incentive\nallocation policies under limited budgets. More specifically, the proposed\napproach can extract information from a high-level network representation for\nlearning effective incentive allocation policies. The proposed GAC only\nrequires the topology of the social network and does not rely on any prior\ninformation about users' attributes. We use three real-world social network\ndatasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed GAC. The experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

However, naively applying\ntransformers to spectrograms is suboptimal.

In our proposal, the student\nlearns the variations in the teacher's intermediate features over time. We\ndemonstrate that these temporal variations can be effectively distilled due to\nthe temporal redundancies within video frames. During inference, both teacher\nand student cooperate for providing predictions: the former by providing\ninitial representations extracted only on the key-frame, and the latter by\niteratively estimating and applying deltas for the successive frames. Moreover,\nwe consider various design choices to learn optimal student architectures\nincluding an end-to-end learnable architecture search. By extensive experiments\non a wide range of architectures, including the most efficient ones, we\ndemonstrate that delta distillation sets a new state of the art in terms of\naccuracy vs. efficiency trade-off for semantic segmentation and object\ndetection in videos.

    "title": "Prioritized Variable-length Test Cases Generation for Finite State  Machines",
    "abstract": "Model-based Testing (MBT) is an effective approach for testing when parts of\na system-under-test have the characteristics of a finite state machine (FSM).\nDespite various strategies in the literature on this topic, little work exists\nto handle special testing situations. More specifically, when concurrently: (1)\nthe test paths can start and end only in defined states of the FSM, (2) a\nprioritization mechanism that requires only defined states and transitions of\nthe FSM to be visited by test cases is required, and (3) the test paths must be\nin a given length range, not necessarily of explicit uniform length. This paper\npresents a test generation strategy that satisfies all these requirements. A\nconcurrent combination of these requirements is highly practical for real\nindustrial testing. Six variants of possible algorithms to implement this\nstrategy are described. Using a mixture of 180 problem instances from real\nautomotive and defense projects and artificially generated FSMs, all variants\nare compared with a baseline strategy based on an established N-switch coverage\nconcept modification. Various properties of the generated test paths and their\npotential to activate fictional defects defined in FSMs are evaluated. The\npresented strategy outperforms the baseline in most problem configurations. Out\nof the six analyzed variants, three give the best results even though a\nuniversal best performer is hard to identify. Depending on the application of\nthe FSM, the strategy and evaluation presented in this paper are applicable\nboth in testing functional and non-functional software requirements.",

An ideal multivariate spatial clustering should consider both\nspatial contiguity and aspatial attributes. Existing spatial clustering\napproaches may face challenges for discovering repeated geographic patterns\nwith spatial contiguity maintained. In this paper, we propose a Spatial\nToeplitz Inverse Covariance-Based Clustering (STICC) method that considers both\nattributes and spatial relationships of geographic objects for multivariate\nspatial clustering. A subregion is created for each geographic object serving\nas the basic unit when performing clustering. A Markov random field is then\nconstructed to characterize the attribute dependencies of subregions. Using a\nspatial consistency strategy, nearby objects are encouraged to belong to the\nsame cluster. To test the performance of the proposed STICC algorithm, we apply\nit in two use cases. The comparison results with several baseline methods show\nthat the STICC outperforms others significantly in terms of adjusted rand index\nand macro-F1 score. Join count statistics is also calculated and shows that the\nspatial contiguity is well preserved by STICC.

    "abstract": "Remote memory techniques for datacenter applications have recently gained a\ngreat deal of popularity. Existing remote memory techniques focus on the\nefficiency of a single application setting only. However, when multiple\napplications co-run on a remote-memory system, significant interference could\noccur, resulting in unexpected slowdowns even if the same amounts of physical\nresources are granted to each application. This slowdown stems from massive\nsharing in applications' swap data paths. Canvas is a redesigned swap system\nthat fully isolates swap paths for remote-memory applications. Canvas allows\neach application to possess its dedicated swap partition, swap cache,\nprefetcher, and RDMA bandwidth. Swap isolation lays a foundation for adaptive\noptimization techniques based on each application's own access patterns and\nneeds. We develop three such techniques: (1) adaptive swap entry allocation,\n(2) semantics-aware prefetching, and (3) two-dimensional RDMA scheduling. A\nthorough evaluation with a set of widely-deployed applications demonstrates\nthat Canvas minimizes performance variation and dramatically reduces\nperformance degradation.",

Our paper provides a roadmap for\nsuccessful projects utilizing IGT data: (1) It is essential to define which NLP\ntasks can be accomplished with the given IGT data and how these will benefit\nthe speech community.

    "abstract": "Effective and efficient planning in continuous state and action spaces is\nfundamentally hard, even when the transition model is deterministic and known.\nOne way to alleviate this challenge is to perform bilevel planning with\nabstractions, where a high-level search for abstract plans is used to guide\nplanning in the original transition space. In this paper, we develop a novel\nframework for learning state and action abstractions that are explicitly\noptimized for both effective (successful) and efficient (fast) bilevel\nplanning. Given demonstrations of tasks in an environment, our data-efficient\napproach learns relational, neuro-symbolic abstractions that generalize over\nobject identities and numbers. The symbolic components resemble the STRIPS\npredicates and operators found in AI planning, and the neural components refine\nthe abstractions into actions that can be executed in the environment.\nExperimentally, we show across four robotic planning environments that our\nlearned abstractions are able to quickly solve held-out tasks of longer\nhorizons than were seen in the demonstrations, and can even outperform the\nefficiency of abstractions that we manually specified. We also find that as the\nplanner configuration varies, the learned abstractions adapt accordingly,\nindicating that our abstraction learning method is both \"task-aware\" and\n\"planner-aware.\" Code: https://tinyurl.com/predicators-release",

Model-based reinforcement\nlearning (MBRL) is one paradigm which relies on the iterative learning and\nprediction of state-action transitions to solve a task.

These\n\"one-step\" predictions are known to become inaccurate over longer horizons of\ncomposed prediction - called the compounding error problem. Given the\nprevalence of the compounding error problem in MBRL and related fields of\ndata-driven control, we set out to understand the properties of and conditions\ncausing these long-horizon errors. In this paper, we explore the effects of\nsubcomponents of a control problem on long term prediction error: including\nchoosing a system, collecting data, and training a model.

    "abstract": "Local feature matching is a computationally intensive task at the subpixel\nlevel. While detector-based methods coupled with feature descriptors struggle\nin low-texture scenes, CNN-based methods with a sequential extract-to-match\npipeline, fail to make use of the matching capacity of the encoder and tend to\noverburden the decoder for matching. In contrast, we propose a novel\nhierarchical extract-and-match transformer, termed as MatchFormer. Inside each\nstage of the hierarchical encoder, we interleave self-attention for feature\nextraction and cross-attention for feature matching, enabling a human-intuitive\nextract-and-match scheme. Such a match-aware encoder releases the overloaded\ndecoder and makes the model highly efficient. Further, combining self- and\ncross-attention on multi-scale features in a hierarchical architecture improves\nmatching robustness, particularly in low-texture indoor scenes or with less\noutdoor training data. Thanks to such a strategy, MatchFormer is a multi-win\nsolution in efficiency, robustness, and precision. Compared to the previous\nbest method in indoor pose estimation, our lite MatchFormer has only 45%\nGFLOPs, yet achieves a +1.3% precision gain and a 41% running speed boost. The\nlarge MatchFormer reaches state-of-the-art on four different benchmarks,\nincluding indoor pose estimation (ScanNet), outdoor pose estimation\n(MegaDepth), homography estimation and image matching (HPatch), and visual\nlocalization (InLoc).

Our work alleviates\nthis from a novel perspective, by exploring rich semantic contexts\nsynergistically among abundant weakly-labeled training data for network\nlearning and inference. In particular, we propose regional semantic contrast\nand aggregation (RCA) . RCA is equipped with a regional memory bank to store\nmassive, diverse object patterns appearing in training data, which acts as\nstrong support for exploration of dataset-level semantic structure.\nParticularly, we propose i) semantic contrast to drive network learning by\ncontrasting massive categorical object regions, leading to a more holistic\nobject pattern understanding, and ii) semantic aggregation to gather diverse\nrelational contexts in the memory to enrich semantic representations. In this\nmanner, RCA earns a strong capability of fine-grained semantic understanding,\nand eventually establishes new state-of-the-art results on two popular\nbenchmarks, i.e., PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO 2014.",

    "abstract": "Identifying stress levels can provide valuable data for mental health\nanalytics as well as labels for annotation systems. Although much research has\nbeen conducted into stress detection models using heart rate variability at a\nhigher cost of data collection, there is a lack of research on the potential of\nusing low-resolution Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals from consumer-grade\nwearable devices to identify stress patterns. In this paper, we concentrate on\nperforming statistical analyses on the stress detection capability of two\npopular approaches of training stress detection models with stress-related\nbiometric signals: user-dependent and user-independent models. Our research\nmanages to show that user-dependent models are statistically more accurate for\nstress detection. In terms of effectiveness assessment, the balanced accuracy\n(BA) metric is employed to evaluate the capability of distinguishing stress and\nnon-stress conditions of the models trained on either low-resolution or\nhigh-resolution Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals. The results from the\nexperiment show that training the model with (comparatively low-cost)\nlow-resolution EDA signal does not affect the stress detection accuracy of the\nmodel significantly compared to using a high-resolution EDA signal. Our\nresearch results demonstrate the potential of attaching the user-dependent\nstress detection model trained on personal low-resolution EDA signal recorded\nto collect data in daily life to provide users with personal stress level\ninsight and analysis.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study a new latency optimization problem for\nBlockchain-based federated learning (BFL) in multi-server edge computing. In\nthis system model, distributed mobile devices (MDs) communicate with a set of\nedge servers (ESs) to handle both machine learning (ML) model training and\nblock mining simultaneously. To assist the ML model training for\nresource-constrained MDs, we develop an offloading strategy that enables MDs to\ntransmit their data to one of the associated ESs. We then propose a new\ndecentralized ML model aggregation solution at the edge layer based on a\nconsensus mechanism to build a global ML model via peer-to-peer (P2P)-based\nBlockchain communications. We then formulate latency-aware BFL as an\noptimization aiming to minimize the system latency via joint consideration of\nthe data offloading decisions, MDs' transmit power, channel bandwidth\nallocation for MDs' data offloading, MDs' computational allocation, and hash\npower allocation. To address the mixed action space of discrete offloading and\ncontinuous allocation variables, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning\nscheme with a holistic design of a parameterized advantage actor critic (A2C)\nalgorithm. Additionally, we theoretically characterize the convergence\nproperties of the proposed BFL system in terms of the aggregation delay,\nmini-batch size, and number of P2P communication rounds.

However, predictions of DNNs are easily manipulated with\nimperceptible adversarial perturbations, which impedes the further deployment\nof DNNs and may result in profound security and privacy implications. By\nincorporating adversarial samples into the training data pool, adversarial\ntraining is the strongest principled strategy against various adversarial\nattacks among all sorts of defense methods. Recent works mainly focus on\ndeveloping new loss functions or regularizers, attempting to find the unique\noptimal point in the weight space. But none of them taps the potentials of\nclassifiers obtained from standard adversarial training, especially states on\nthe searching trajectory of training. In this work, we are dedicated to the\nweight states of models through the training process and devise a simple but\npowerful \\emph{Self-Ensemble Adversarial Training} (SEAT) method for yielding a\nrobust classifier by averaging weights of history models. This considerably\nimproves the robustness of the target model against several well known\nadversarial attacks, even merely utilizing the naive cross-entropy loss to\nsupervise. We also discuss the relationship between the ensemble of predictions\nfrom different adversarially trained models and the prediction of\nweight-ensembled models, as well as provide theoretical and empirical evidence\nthat the proposed self-ensemble method provides a smoother loss landscape and\nbetter robustness than both individual models and the ensemble of predictions\nfrom different classifiers.

    "abstract": "Learning a dense 3D model with fine-scale details from a single facial image\nis highly challenging and ill-posed. To address this problem, many approaches\nfit smooth geometries through facial prior while learning details as additional\ndisplacement maps or personalized basis. However, these techniques typically\nrequire vast datasets of paired multi-view data or 3D scans, whereas such\ndatasets are scarce and expensive. To alleviate heavy data dependency, we\npresent a robust texture-guided geometric detail recovery approach using only a\nsingle in-the-wild facial image. More specifically, our method combines\nhigh-quality texture completion with the powerful expressiveness of implicit\nsurfaces. Initially, we inpaint occluded facial parts, generate complete\ntextures, and build an accurate multi-view dataset of the same subject. In\norder to estimate the detailed geometry, we define an implicit signed distance\nfunction and employ a physically-based implicit renderer to reconstruct fine\ngeometric details from the generated multi-view images. Our method not only\nrecovers accurate facial details but also decomposes normals, albedos, and\nshading parts in a self-supervised way. Finally, we register the implicit shape\ndetails to a 3D Morphable Model template, which can be used in traditional\nmodeling and rendering pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed approach can reconstruct impressive facial details from a single\nimage, especially when compared with state-of-the-art methods trained on large\ndatasets.",

    "abstract": "Learning discriminative representation from the complex spatio-temporal\ndynamic space is essential for video recognition. On top of those stylized\nspatio-temporal computational units, further refining the learnt feature with\naxial contexts is demonstrated to be promising in achieving this goal. However,\nprevious works generally focus on utilizing a single kind of contexts to\ncalibrate entire feature channels and could hardly apply to deal with diverse\nvideo activities. The problem can be tackled by using pair-wise spatio-temporal\nattentions to recompute feature response with cross-axis contexts at the\nexpense of heavy computations. In this paper, we propose an efficient feature\nrefinement method that decomposes the feature channels into several groups and\nseparately refines them with different axial contexts in parallel. We refer\nthis lightweight feature calibration as group contextualization (GC).\nSpecifically, we design a family of efficient element-wise calibrators, i.e.,\nECal-G/S/T/L, where their axial contexts are information dynamics aggregated\nfrom other axes either globally or locally, to contextualize feature channel\ngroups. The GC module can be densely plugged into each residual layer of the\noff-the-shelf video networks. With little computational overhead, consistent\nimprovement is observed when plugging in GC on different networks. By utilizing\ncalibrators to embed feature with four different kinds of contexts in parallel,\nthe learnt representation is expected to be more resilient to diverse types of\nactivities. On videos with rich temporal variations, empirically GC can boost\nthe performance of 2D-CNN (e.g., TSN and TSM) to a level comparable to the\nstate-of-the-art video networks.

    "abstract": "Detecting objects from LiDAR point clouds is of tremendous significance in\nautonomous driving. In spite of good progress, accurate and reliable 3D\ndetection is yet to be achieved due to the sparsity and irregularity of LiDAR\npoint clouds. Among existing strategies, multi-view methods have shown great\npromise by leveraging the more comprehensive information from both bird's eye\nview (BEV) and range view (RV). These multi-view methods either refine the\nproposals predicted from single view via fused features, or fuse the features\nwithout considering the global spatial context; their performance is limited\nconsequently. In this paper, we propose to adaptively fuse multi-view features\nin a global spatial context via Dual Cross-VIew SpaTial Attention (VISTA). The\nproposed VISTA is a novel plug-and-play fusion module, wherein the multi-layer\nperceptron widely adopted in standard attention modules is replaced with a\nconvolutional one. Thanks to the learned attention mechanism, VISTA can produce\nfused features of high quality for prediction of proposals. We decouple the\nclassification and regression tasks in VISTA, and an additional constraint of\nattention variance is applied that enables the attention module to focus on\nspecific targets instead of generic points. We conduct thorough experiments on\nthe benchmarks of nuScenes and Waymo; results confirm the efficacy of our\ndesigns.

Many existing studies learn the syntactic and semantic knowledge\nof code snippets from their token sequences and Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).\nThey use the learned code representations as input to code summarization\nmodels, which can accordingly generate summaries describing source code.\nTraditional models traverse ASTs as sequences or split ASTs into paths as\ninput. However, the former loses the structural properties of ASTs, and the\nlatter destroys the overall structure of ASTs. Therefore, comprehensively\ncapturing the structural features of ASTs in learning code representations for\nsource code summarization remains a challenging problem to be solved. In this\npaper, we propose M2TS, a Multi-scale Multi-modal approach based on Transformer\nfor source code Summarization. M2TS uses a multi-scale AST feature extraction\nmethod, which can extract the structures of ASTs more completely and accurately\nat multiple local and global levels.

    "abstract": "Automatic evaluation metrics are essential for the rapid development of\nopen-domain dialogue systems as they facilitate hyper-parameter tuning and\ncomparison between models. Although recently proposed trainable\nconversation-level metrics have shown encouraging results, the quality of the\nmetrics is strongly dependent on the quality of training data. Prior works\nmainly resort to heuristic text-level manipulations (e.g. utterances shuffling)\nto bootstrap incoherent conversations (negative examples) from coherent\ndialogues (positive examples). Such approaches are insufficient to\nappropriately reflect the incoherence that occurs in interactions between\nadvanced dialogue models and humans. To tackle this problem, we propose DEAM, a\nDialogue coherence Evaluation metric that relies on Abstract Meaning\nRepresentation (AMR) to apply semantic-level Manipulations for incoherent\n(negative) data generation. AMRs naturally facilitate the injection of various\ntypes of incoherence sources, such as coreference inconsistency, irrelevancy,\ncontradictions, and decrease engagement, at the semantic level, thus resulting\nin more natural incoherent samples. Our experiments show that DEAM achieves\nhigher correlations with human judgments compared to baseline methods on\nseveral dialog datasets by significant margins. We also show that DEAM can\ndistinguish between coherent and incoherent dialogues generated by baseline\nmanipulations, whereas those baseline models cannot detect incoherent examples\ngenerated by DEAM.

In the second stage, each agent takes an action based on\nthe information provided by his selected IS. There is a rational Bayesian\npersuader who controls one IS and aims to influence the agents' actions to\ninduce her desired dynamic equilibria by solely crafting the information\nstructure of her IS.

Our approach and system DEFORM, a Deep Learning (DL) based RX\nbeamforming achieves significant gain for multi antenna RF receivers while\nbeing agnostic to the transmitted signal features (e.g., modulation or\nbandwidth). It is well known that combining coherent RF signals from multiple\nantennas results in a beamforming gain proportional to the number of receiving\nelements. However in practice, this approach heavily relies on explicit channel\nestimation techniques, which are link specific and require significant\ncommunication overhead to be transmitted to the receiver. DEFORM addresses this\nchallenge by leveraging Convolutional Neural Network to estimate the channel\ncharacteristics in particular the relative phase to antenna elements. It is\nspecifically designed to address the unique features of wireless signals\ncomplex samples, such as the ambiguous $2\\pi$ phase discontinuity and the high\nsensitivity of the link Bit Error Rate. The channel prediction is subsequently\nused in the Maximum Ratio Combining algorithm to achieve an optimal combination\nof the received signals. While being trained on a fixed, basic RF settings, we\nshow that DEFORM DL model is universal, achieving up to 3 dB of SNR gain for a\ntwo antenna receiver in extensive experiments demonstrating various settings of\nmodulations, bandwidths, and channels. The universality of DEFORM is\ndemonstrated through joint beamforming relaying of LoRa (Chirp Spread Spectrum\nmodulation) and ZigBee signals, achieving significant improvements to Packet\nLoss/Delivery Rates relatively to conventional Amplify and Forward (LoRa PLR\nreduced by 23 times and ZigBee PDR increased by 8 times).",

Existing LA methods mostly focus on the design of pos weighting\nfunction, while the neg weight is directly derived from the pos weight. Such a\nmechanism limits the learning capacity of detectors. In this paper, we explore\na new weighting paradigm, termed dual weighting (DW), to specify pos and neg\nweights separately. We first identify the key influential factors of pos/neg\nweights by analyzing the evaluation metrics in object detection, and then\ndesign the pos and neg weighting functions based on them. Specifically, the pos\nweight of a sample is determined by the consistency degree between its\nclassification and localization scores, while the neg weight is decomposed into\ntwo terms: the probability that it is a neg sample and its importance\nconditioned on being a neg sample. Such a weighting strategy offers greater\nflexibility to distinguish between important and less important samples,\nresulting in a more effective object detector.

To better understand the role of blockchain in the metaverse, we\naim to provide an extensive survey on the applications of blockchain for the\nmetaverse. We first present a preliminary to blockchain and the metaverse and\nhighlight the motivations behind the use of blockchain for the metaverse. Next,\nwe extensively discuss blockchain-based methods for the metaverse from\ntechnical perspectives, such as data acquisition, data storage, data sharing,\ndata interoperability, and data privacy preservation. For each perspective, we\nfirst discuss the technical challenges of the metaverse and then highlight how\nblockchain can help. Moreover, we investigate the impact of blockchain on\nkey-enabling technologies in the metaverse, including Internet-of-Things,\ndigital twins, multi-sensory and immersive applications, artificial\nintelligence, and big data. We also present some major projects to showcase the\nrole of blockchain in metaverse applications and services. Finally, we present\nsome promising directions to drive further research innovations and\ndevelopments towards the use of blockchain in the metaverse in the future.",

    "title": "Do Deep Networks Transfer Invariances Across Classes?",
    "abstract": "To generalize well, classifiers must learn to be invariant to nuisance\ntransformations that do not alter an input's class. Many problems have\n\"class-agnostic\" nuisance transformations that apply similarly to all classes,\nsuch as lighting and background changes for image classification. Neural\nnetworks can learn these invariances given sufficient data, but many real-world\ndatasets are heavily class imbalanced and contain only a few examples for most\nof the classes. We therefore pose the question: how well do neural networks\ntransfer class-agnostic invariances learned from the large classes to the small\nones? Through careful experimentation, we observe that invariance to\nclass-agnostic transformations is still heavily dependent on class size, with\nthe networks being much less invariant on smaller classes. This result holds\neven when using data balancing techniques, and suggests poor invariance\ntransfer across classes. Our results provide one explanation for why\nclassifiers generalize poorly on unbalanced and long-tailed distributions.\nBased on this analysis, we show how a generative approach for learning the\nnuisance transformations can help transfer invariances across classes and\nimprove performance on a set of imbalanced image classification benchmarks.\nSource code for our experiments is available at\nhttps://github.com/AllanYangZhou/generative-invariance-transfer.",

    "title": "Towards non-independence of modular additions in searching differential  trails of ARX ciphers: new automatic methods with application to SPECK and  Chaskey",
    "abstract": "ARX-based ciphers, constructed by the modular addition, rotation and XOR\noperations, have been receiving a lot of attention in the design of lightweight\nsymmetric ciphers. For their differential cryptanalysis, most automatic search\nmethods of differential trails adopt the assumption of independence of modulo\nadditions. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold when the trail\nincludes consecutive modular additions (CMAs). It has already been found that\nin this case some differential trails searched by automatic methods before are\nactually impossible, but the study is not in depth yet, for example, few effort\nhas been paid to exploiting the root causes of non-independence between CMAs\nand accurate calculation of probabilities of the valid trails. In this paper,\nwe devote to solving these two problems. By examing the differential equations\nof single and consecutive modular additions, we find that the influence of\nnon-independence can be described by relationships between constraints on the\nintermediate state of two additions. Specifically, constraints of the first\naddition can make some of its output bits non-uniform, and when they meet the\nconstraints of the second addition, the differential probability of the whole\nCMA may be different from the value calculated under the independence\nassumption. As a result, we can build SAT models to verify the validity of a\ngiven differential trail of ARX ciphers and #SAT models to calculate the exact\nprobabilities of the differential propagation through CMAs in the trail,\npromising a more accurate evaluation of probability of the trail. Our automic\nmethods and searching tools are applied to search related-key differential\ntrails of SPECK and Chaskey including CMAs in the key schedule and the round\nfunction respectively.",

    "abstract": "Domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to learn a model with the\nsupervision of source domain data, and produce satisfactory dense predictions\non unlabeled target domain. One popular solution to this challenging task is\nself-training, which selects high-scoring predictions on target samples as\npseudo labels for training. However, the produced pseudo labels often contain\nmuch noise because the model is biased to source domain as well as majority\ncategories. To address the above issues, we propose to directly explore the\nintrinsic pixel distributions of target domain data, instead of heavily relying\non the source domain. Specifically, we simultaneously cluster pixels and\nrectify pseudo labels with the obtained cluster assignments. This process is\ndone in an online fashion so that pseudo labels could co-evolve with the\nsegmentation model without extra training rounds. To overcome the class\nimbalance problem on long-tailed categories, we employ a distribution alignment\ntechnique to enforce the marginal class distribution of cluster assignments to\nbe close to that of pseudo labels. The proposed method, namely Class-balanced\nPixel-level Self-Labeling (CPSL), improves the segmentation performance on\ntarget domain over state-of-the-arts by a large margin, especially on\nlong-tailed categories.",

    "abstract": "In simulation sciences, it is desirable to capture the real-world problem\nfeatures as accurately as possible. Methods popular for scientific simulations\nsuch as the finite element method (FEM) and finite volume method (FVM) use\npiecewise polynomials to approximate various characteristics of a problem, such\nas the concentration profile and the temperature distribution across the\ndomain. Polynomials are prone to creating artifacts such as Gibbs oscillations\nwhile capturing a complex profile. An efficient and accurate approach must be\napplied to deal with such inconsistencies in order to obtain accurate\nsimulations. This often entails dealing with negative values for the\nconcentration of chemicals, exceeding a percentage value over 100, and other\nsuch problems. We consider these inconsistencies in the context of partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs). We propose an innovative filter based on convex\noptimization to deal with the inconsistencies observed in polynomial-based\nsimulations. In two or three spatial dimensions, additional complexities are\ninvolved in solving the problems related to structure preservation. We present\nthe construction and application of a structure-preserving filter with a focus\non multidimensional PDEs. Methods used such as the Barycentric interpolation\nfor polynomial evaluation at arbitrary points in the domain and an optimized\nroot-finder to identify points of interest improve the filter efficiency,\nusability, and robustness. Lastly, we present numerical experiments in 2D and\n3D using discontinuous Galerkin formulation and demonstrate the filter's\nefficacy to preserve the desired structure. As a real-world application,\nimplementation of the mathematical biology model involving platelet aggregation\nand blood coagulation has been reviewed and the issues around FEM\nimplementation of the model are resolved by applying the proposed\nstructure-preserving filter.",

From the perspective of neural network pruning,\nwe propose a novel end-to-end sparse adversarial attack method, namely\nAutoAdversary, which can find the most important pixels automatically by\nintegrating the pixel selection into the adversarial attack. Specifically, our\nmethod utilizes a trainable neural network to generate a binary mask for the\npixel selection.

    "abstract": "Video frame interpolation (VFI) aims to improve the temporal resolution of a\nvideo sequence. Most of the existing deep learning based VFI methods adopt\noff-the-shelf optical flow algorithms to estimate the bidirectional flows and\ninterpolate the missing frames accordingly. Though having achieved a great\nsuccess, these methods require much human experience to tune the bidirectional\nflows and often generate unpleasant results when the estimated flows are not\naccurate. In this work, we rethink the VFI problem and formulate it as a\ncontinuous image transition (CIT) task, whose key issue is to transition an\nimage from one space to another space continuously. More specifically, we learn\nto implicitly decouple the images into a translatable flow space and a\nnon-translatable feature space. The former depicts the translatable states\nbetween the given images, while the later aims to reconstruct the intermediate\nfeatures that cannot be directly translated. In this way, we can easily perform\nimage interpolation in the flow space and intermediate image synthesis in the\nfeature space, obtaining a CIT model. The proposed space decoupled learning\n(SDL) approach is simple to implement, while it provides an effective framework\nto a variety of CIT problems beyond VFI, such as style transfer and image\nmorphing. Our extensive experiments on a variety of CIT tasks demonstrate the\nsuperiority of SDL to existing methods. The source code and models can be found\nat \\url{https://github.com/yangxy/SDL}.",

Previous\nalgorithms mostly adopt 3D CNNs to learn video representation, struggling to\ncapture long-term context and easily suffering from visual-linguistic\nmisalignment. In light of this, we present Locater (local-global context aware\nTransformer), which augments the Transformer architecture with a finite memory\nso as to query the entire video with the language expression in an efficient\nmanner. The memory is designed to involve two components -- one for\npersistently preserving global video content, and one for dynamically gathering\nlocal temporal context and segmentation history. Based on the memorized\nlocal-global context and the particular content of each frame, Locater\nholistically and flexibly comprehends the expression as an adaptive query\nvector for each frame. The vector is used to query the corresponding frame for\nmask generation. The memory also allows Locater to process videos with linear\ntime complexity and constant size memory, while Transformer-style\nself-attention computation scales quadratically with sequence length. To\nthoroughly examine the visual grounding capability of LVS models, we contribute\na new LVS dataset, A2D-S+, which is built upon A2D-S dataset but poses\nincreased challenges in disambiguating among similar objects. Experiments on\nthree LVS datasets and our A2D-S+ show that Locater outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-arts.

Through this framework, feature discrimination\nbetween foreground and background is largely improved, facilitating learning of\nthe class-agnostic mask segmentation model. Exhaustive experiments on the COCO\ndataset demonstrate the superiority of our method, which outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-arts.",

Existing\ntechniques for the source attribution of synthetic images identify subtle\nintrinsic fingerprints using multiclass classification neural nets limited in\nfunctionality and scalability. Hence, we redefine the deepfake detection and\nsource attribution problems as a series of related binary classification tasks.\nWe leverage transfer learning to rapidly adapt forgery detection networks for\nmultiple independent attribution problems, by proposing a semi-decentralized\nmodular design to solve them simultaneously and efficiently. Class activation\nmapping is also demonstrated as an effective means of feature localization for\nmodel interpretation. Our models are determined via experimentation to be\ncompetitive with current benchmarks, and capable of decent performance on human\nportraits in ideal conditions. Decentralized fingerprint-based attribution is\nfound to retain validity in the presence of novel sources, but is more\nsusceptible to type II errors that intensify with image perturbations and\nattributive uncertainty.

Many multi-modal methods are proposed to alleviate this issue,\nwhile different representations of images and point clouds make it difficult to\nfuse them, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present a\nnovel multi-modal framework SFD (Sparse Fuse Dense), which utilizes pseudo\npoint clouds generated from depth completion to tackle the issues mentioned\nabove. Different from prior works, we propose a new RoI fusion strategy 3D-GAF\n(3D Grid-wise Attentive Fusion) to make fuller use of information from\ndifferent types of point clouds. Specifically, 3D-GAF fuses 3D RoI features\nfrom the couple of point clouds in a grid-wise attentive way, which is more\nfine-grained and more precise. In addition, we propose a SynAugment\n(Synchronized Augmentation) to enable our multi-modal framework to utilize all\ndata augmentation approaches tailored to LiDAR-only methods. Lastly, we\ncustomize an effective and efficient feature extractor CPConv (Color Point\nConvolution) for pseudo point clouds. It can explore 2D image features and 3D\ngeometric features of pseudo point clouds simultaneously.

    "abstract": "Classically, the mechanical response of materials is described through\nconstitutive models, often in the form of constrained ordinary differential\nequations. These models have a very limited number of parameters, yet, they are\nextremely efficient in reproducing complex responses observed in experiments.\nAdditionally, in their discretized form, they are computationally very\nefficient, often resulting in a simple algebraic relation, and therefore they\nhave been extensively used within large-scale explicit and implicit finite\nelement models. However, it is very challenging to formulate new constitutive\nmodels, particularly for materials with complex microstructures such as\ncomposites. A recent trend in constitutive modeling leverages complex neural\nnetwork architectures to construct complex material responses where a\nconstitutive model does not yet exist. Whilst very accurate, they suffer from\ntwo deficiencies. First, they are interpolation models and often do poorly in\nextrapolation. Second, due to their complex architecture and numerous\nparameters, they are inefficient to be used as a constitutive model within a\nlarge-scale finite element model. In this study, we propose a novel approach\nbased on the physics-informed learning machines for the characterization and\ndiscovery of constitutive models. Unlike data-driven constitutive models, we\nleverage foundations of elastoplasticity theory as regularization terms in the\ntotal loss function to find parametric constitutive models that are also\ntheoretically sound.

In this paper, we present AdIoTack, a system that\nhighlights vulnerabilities of decision trees against adversarial attacks,\nhelping cybersecurity teams quantify and refine the resilience of their trained\nmodels for monitoring IoT networks. To assess the model for the worst-case\nscenario, AdIoTack performs white-box adversarial learning to launch successful\nvolumetric attacks that decision tree ensemble models cannot flag. Our first\ncontribution is to develop a white-box algorithm that takes a trained decision\ntree ensemble model and the profile of an intended network-based attack on a\nvictim class as inputs. It then automatically generates recipes that specify\ncertain packets on top of the indented attack packets (less than 15% overhead)\nthat together can bypass the inference model unnoticed. We ensure that the\ngenerated attack instances are feasible for launching on IP networks and\neffective in their volumetric impact. Our second contribution develops a method\nto monitor the network behavior of connected devices actively, inject\nadversarial traffic (when feasible) on behalf of a victim IoT device, and\nsuccessfully launch the intended attack. Our third contribution prototypes\nAdIoTack and validates its efficacy on a testbed consisting of a handful of\nreal IoT devices monitored by a trained inference model.

(2) Fine-tuning the weights of the attention layers is sufficient to\nadapt vision transformers to a higher resolution and to other classification\ntasks.

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is one of the promising approaches for\nintroducing robots into complicated environments. The recent remarkable\nprogress of DRL stands on regularization of policy, which allows the policy to\nimprove stably and efficiently. A popular method, so-called proximal policy\noptimization (PPO), and its variants constrain density ratio of the latest and\nbaseline policies when the density ratio exceeds a given threshold. This\nthreshold can be designed relatively intuitively, and in fact its recommended\nvalue range has been suggested. However, the density ratio is asymmetric for\nits center, and the possible error scale from its center, which should be close\nto the threshold, would depend on how the baseline policy is given. In order to\nmaximize the values of regularization of policy, this paper proposes a new PPO\nderived using relative Pearson (RPE) divergence, therefore so-called PPO-RPE,\nto design the threshold adaptively. In PPO-RPE, the relative density ratio,\nwhich can be formed with symmetry, replaces the raw density ratio. Thanks to\nthis symmetry, its error scale from center can easily be estimated, hence, the\nthreshold can be adapted for the estimated error scale. From three simple\nbenchmark simulations, the importance of algorithm-dependent threshold design\nis revealed. By simulating additional four locomotion tasks, it is verified\nthat the proposed method statistically contributes to task accomplishment by\nappropriately restricting the policy updates.",

    "abstract": "This work digs into a root question in human perception: can face geometry be\ngleaned from one's voices? Previous works that study this question only adopt\ndevelopments in image synthesis and convert voices into face images to show\ncorrelations, but working on the image domain unavoidably involves predicting\nattributes that voices cannot hint, including facial textures, hairstyles, and\nbackgrounds. We instead investigate the ability to reconstruct 3D faces to\nconcentrate on only geometry, which is much more physiologically grounded. We\npropose our analysis framework, Cross-Modal Perceptionist, under both\nsupervised and unsupervised learning. First, we construct a dataset,\nVoxceleb-3D, which extends Voxceleb and includes paired voices and face meshes,\nmaking supervised learning possible. Second, we use a knowledge distillation\nmechanism to study whether face geometry can still be gleaned from voices\nwithout paired voices and 3D face data under limited availability of 3D face\nscans. We break down the core question into four parts and perform visual and\nnumerical analyses as responses to the core question. Our findings echo those\nin physiology and neuroscience about the correlation between voices and facial\nstructures.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised speech recognition models require considerable labeled\ntraining data for learning high-fidelity representations for Automatic Speech\nRecognition (ASR), which hinders their application to low-resource languages.\nWe consider the task of identifying an optimal subset of training data to\nfine-tune self-supervised speech models for ASR. We make a surprising\nobservation that active learning strategies for sampling harder-to-learn\nexamples do not perform better than random subset selection for fine-tuning\nself-supervised ASR. We then present the COWERAGE algorithm for better subset\nselection in self-supervised ASR which is based on our finding that ensuring\nthe coverage of examples based on training WER in the early training epochs\nleads to better generalization performance. Extensive experiments on the\nwav2vec 2.0 model and TIMIT dataset show the effectiveness of COWERAGE, with up\nto 27% absolute WER improvement over active learning methods. We also report\nthe connection between training WER and the phonemic cover and demonstrate that\nour algorithm ensures inclusion of phonemically diverse examples.",

The dominant paradigms rely on\npurely CNN-based architectures which often fail in incorporating relations of\nlong-range lane points and global contexts induced by surrounding objects\n(e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). Inspired by recent advances of the transformer\nencoder-decoder architecture in various vision tasks, we move forwards to\ndesign a new end-to-end Laneformer architecture that revolutionizes the\nconventional transformers into better capturing the shape and semantic\ncharacteristics of lanes, with minimal overhead in latency. First, coupling\nwith deformable pixel-wise self-attention in the encoder, Laneformer presents\ntwo new row and column self-attention operations to efficiently mine point\ncontext along with the lane shapes.

    "abstract": "To perform adversarial attacks in the physical world, many studies have\nproposed adversarial camouflage, a method to hide a target object by applying\ncamouflage patterns on 3D object surfaces. For obtaining optimal physical\nadversarial camouflage, previous studies have utilized the so-called neural\nrenderer, as it supports differentiability. However, existing neural renderers\ncannot fully represent various real-world transformations due to a lack of\ncontrol of scene parameters compared to the legacy photo-realistic renderers.\nIn this paper, we propose the Differentiable Transformation Attack (DTA), a\nframework for generating a robust physical adversarial pattern on a target\nobject to camouflage it against object detection models with a wide range of\ntransformations. It utilizes our novel Differentiable Transformation Network\n(DTN), which learns the expected transformation of a rendered object when the\ntexture is changed while preserving the original properties of the target\nobject. Using our attack framework, an adversary can gain both the advantages\nof the legacy photo-realistic renderers including various physical-world\ntransformations and the benefit of white-box access by offering\ndifferentiability. Our experiments show that our camouflaged 3D vehicles can\nsuccessfully evade state-of-the-art object detection models in the\nphoto-realistic environment (i.e., CARLA on Unreal Engine).

This is\ndone by embedding a clear path action (beep) into the RL framework, and the\nproposed navigation policy leads the robot to finish tasks efficiently and\nsafely.

    "abstract": "Camouflage is a common visual phenomenon, which refers to hiding the\nforeground objects into the background images, making them briefly invisible to\nthe human eye. Previous work has typically been implemented by an iterative\noptimization process. However, these methods struggle in 1) efficiently\ngenerating camouflage images using foreground and background with arbitrary\nstructure; 2) camouflaging foreground objects to regions with multiple\nappearances (e.g. the junction of the vegetation and the mountains), which\nlimit their practical application. To address these problems, this paper\nproposes a novel Location-free Camouflage Generation Network (LCG-Net) that\nfuse high-level features of foreground and background image, and generate\nresult by one inference. Specifically, a Position-aligned Structure Fusion\n(PSF) module is devised to guide structure feature fusion based on the\npoint-to-point structure similarity of foreground and background, and introduce\nlocal appearance features point-by-point. To retain the necessary identifiable\nfeatures, a new immerse loss is adopted under our pipeline, while a background\npatch appearance loss is utilized to ensure that the hidden objects look\ncontinuous and natural at regions with multiple appearances. Experiments show\nthat our method has results as satisfactory as state-of-the-art in the\nsingle-appearance regions and are less likely to be completely invisible, but\nfar exceed the quality of the state-of-the-art in the multi-appearance regions.\nMoreover, our method is hundreds of times faster than previous methods.\nBenefitting from the unique advantages of our method, we provide some\ndownstream applications for camouflage generation, which show its potential.\nThe related code and dataset will be released at\nhttps://github.com/Tale17/LCG-Net.",

Its goal is to recover dense panoramic depths from raw\nsparse ones and panoramic RGB images. To deal with the PDC task, we train a\ndeep network that takes both depth and image as inputs for the dense panoramic\ndepth recovery.

To address\nthis problem, we propose a simple yet effective approach termed M{^3}PT:\nmulti-modal masked pre-training. Specifically, during pre-training, we\nsimultaneously cover up patches of the panoramic RGB image and sparse depth by\nshared random mask, then reconstruct the sparse depth in the masked regions. To\nour best knowledge, it is the first time that we show the effectiveness of\nmasked pre-training in a multi-modal vision task, instead of the single-modal\ntask resolved by masked autoencoders (MAE).

In this interdisciplinary work, a joint endeavor of\ncomputer scientists, ethicists, and scholars in Science & Technology Studies,\nwe investigate and evaluate opportunities and risks involved in using Visual\nanalytics approaches for communication analysis in intelligence applications in\nparticular. We introduce, at first, the common technological systems used in\ncommunication analysis, further discussing the domain-specific ethical\nimplications, tensions, and risks involved. We then make the case of how\ntailored Visual Analytics approaches may reduce and mitigate the described\nproblems, both theoretically and through practical examples. We show that\nfinding Visual Analytics design solutions for ethical issues is not a mere\noptimization task, but balancing out and negotiating these trade-offs has, as\nwe argue, to be an integral aspect of the system design process from the\noutset.",

    "abstract": "This work aims to derive a data-independent finite-sample error bound for the\nleast-squares (LS) estimation error of switched linear systems when the state\nand the switching signal are measured. While the existing finite-sample bounds\nfor linear system identification extend to the problem under consideration, the\nGramian of the switched system, an essential term in the error bound, depends\non the measured switching signal. Therefore, data-independent bounds on the\nspectrum of the Gramian are developed for globally asymptotically and\nmarginally stable switched systems when the switching is arbitrary or subject\nto an average dwell time constraint. Combining the bounds on the spectrum of\nthe Gramian and the preliminary error bound extended from linear system\nidentification leads to the error bound for the LS estimate of the switched\nsystem.",

    "abstract": "Gender bias is largely recognized as a problematic phenomenon affecting\nlanguage technologies, with recent studies underscoring that it might surface\ndifferently across languages. However, most of current evaluation practices\nadopt a word-level focus on a narrow set of occupational nouns under synthetic\nconditions. Such protocols overlook key features of grammatical gender\nlanguages, which are characterized by morphosyntactic chains of gender\nagreement, marked on a variety of lexical items and parts-of-speech (POS). To\novercome this limitation, we enrich the natural, gender-sensitive MuST-SHE\ncorpus (Bentivogli et al., 2020) with two new linguistic annotation layers (POS\nand agreement chains), and explore to what extent different lexical categories\nand agreement phenomena are impacted by gender skews. Focusing on speech\ntranslation, we conduct a multifaceted evaluation on three language directions\n(English-French/Italian/Spanish), with models trained on varying amounts of\ndata and different word segmentation techniques. By shedding light on model\nbehaviours, gender bias, and its detection at several levels of granularity,\nour findings emphasize the value of dedicated analyses beyond aggregated\noverall results.",

    "abstract": "Soft electronic skins are one of the means to turn an industrial manipulator\ninto a collaborative robot. For manipulators that are already fit for physical\nhuman-robot collaboration, soft skins can make them safer. In this work, we\nstudy the after impact behavior of two collaborative manipulators (UR10e and\nKUKA LBR iiwa) and one classical industrial manipulator (KUKA Cybertech), in\nthe presence or absence of an industrial protective skin (AIRSKIN). In\naddition, we isolate the effects of the passive padding and the active\ncontribution of the sensor to robot reaction. We present a total of 2250\ncollision measurements and study the impact force, contact duration, clamping\nforce, and impulse. The dataset is publicly available. We summarize our results\nas follows. For transient collisions, the passive skin properties lowered the\nimpact forces by about 40 %. During quasi-static contact, the effect of skin\ncovers -- active or passive -- cannot be isolated from the collision detection\nand reaction by the collaborative robots. Important effects of the stop\ncategories triggered by the active protective skin were found. We\nsystematically compare the different settings and the empirically established\nsafe velocities with prescriptions by the ISO/TS 15066. In some cases, up to\nthe quadruple of the ISO/TS 15066 prescribed velocity can comply with the\nimpact force limits and thus be considered safe. We propose an extension of the\nformulas relating impact force and permissible velocity that take into account\nthe stiffness and compressible thickness of the protective cover, leading to\nbetter predictions of the collision forces. At the same time, this work\nemphasizes the need for in situ measurements as all the factors we studied --\npresence of active/passive skin, safety stop settings, robot collision\nreaction, impact direction, and, of course, velocity -- have effects on the\nforce evolution after impact.",

We mitigate the conflict by imposing\nboundedness on both the data types, reducing from R^3 to Z^3 when needed, and\nthe motion and environment models, reducing the set of allowed local actions\nand global paths.

For\ngraph cut based spectral clustering, it is common to model real-valued data\ninto graph by modeling pairwise similarities using kernel function.

For\nproblems where using multi-way similarities are more suitable than pairwise\nones, it is natural to model as a hypergraph, which is generalization of a\ngraph.

Given the task's complexity, best\nresults have typically been reported for systems focusing on specific settings,\ne.g. instrument-specific systems tend to yield improved results over\ninstrument-agnostic methods. Similarly, higher accuracy can be obtained when\nonly estimating frame-wise $f_0$ values and neglecting the harder note event\ndetection. Despite their high accuracy, such specialized systems often cannot\nbe deployed in the real-world. Storage and network constraints prohibit the use\nof multiple specialized models, while memory and run-time constraints limit\ntheir complexity. In this paper, we propose a lightweight neural network for\nmusical instrument transcription, which supports polyphonic outputs and\ngeneralizes to a wide variety of instruments (including vocals). Our model is\ntrained to jointly predict frame-wise onsets, multipitch and note activations,\nand we experimentally show that this multi-output structure improves the\nresulting frame-level note accuracy. Despite its simplicity, benchmark results\nshow our system's note estimation to be substantially better than a comparable\nbaseline, and its frame-level accuracy to be only marginally below those of\nspecialized state-of-the-art AMT systems.

Their feedback was used to fine-tune the value of an\neffort threshold, above which developers can be considered as full-time.\nWith the help of the over 1,000 questionnaires received, we were able to\ndetermine, for every project in our sample, the threshold of commits that\nseparates full-time from non-full-time developers.%, and that minimizes the\ntype I and type II errors. We finally offer guidelines and a tool to apply our\nmodel to FOSS projects that use a version control system.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of regulatory data minimization obligations is to limit personal\ndata to the absolute minimum necessary for a given context. Beyond the initial\ndata collection, storage, and processing, data minimization is also required\nfor subsequent data releases, as it is the case when data are provided using\nquery-capable Web APIs. Data-providing Web APIs, however, typically lack\nsophisticated data minimization features, leaving the task open to manual and\nall too often missing implementations. In this paper, we address the problem of\ndata minimization for data-providing, query-capable Web APIs. Based on a\ncareful analysis of functional and non-functional requirements, we introduce\nJanus, an easy-to-use, highly configurable solution for implementing legally\ncompliant data minimization in GraphQL Web APIs. Janus provides a rich set of\ninformation reduction functionalities that can be configured for different\nclient roles accessing the API. We present a technical proof-of-concept along\nwith experimental measurements that indicate reasonable overheads. Janus is\nthus a practical solution for implementing GraphQL APIs in line with the\nregulatory principle of data minimization.",

    "abstract": "Massively multilingual sentence representations are trained on large corpora\nof uncurated data, with a very imbalanced proportion of languages included in\nthe training. This may cause the models to grasp cultural values including\nmoral judgments from the high-resource languages and impose them on the\nlow-resource languages. The lack of data in certain languages can also lead to\ndeveloping random and thus potentially harmful beliefs. Both these issues can\nnegatively influence zero-shot cross-lingual model transfer and potentially\nlead to harmful outcomes. Therefore, we aim to (1) detect and quantify these\nissues by comparing different models in different languages, (2) develop\nmethods for improving undesirable properties of the models. Our initial\nexperiments using the multilingual model XLM-R show that indeed multilingual\nLMs capture moral norms, even with potentially higher human-agreement than\nmonolingual ones.

Human has the\nability that transform the various exocentric interactions to invariant\negocentric affordance so as to counter the impact of interactive diversity. To\nempower an agent with such ability, this paper proposes a task of affordance\ngrounding from exocentric view, i.e., given exocentric human-object interaction\nand egocentric object images, learning the affordance knowledge of the object\nand transferring it to the egocentric image using only the affordance label as\nsupervision. To this end, we devise a cross-view knowledge transfer framework\nthat extracts affordance-specific features from exocentric interactions and\nenhances the perception of affordance regions by preserving affordance\ncorrelation. Specifically, an Affordance Invariance Mining module is devised to\nextract specific clues by minimizing the intra-class differences originated\nfrom interaction habits in exocentric images. Besides, an Affordance\nCo-relation Preserving strategy is presented to perceive and localize\naffordance by aligning the co-relation matrix of predicted results between the\ntwo views. Particularly, an affordance grounding dataset named AGD20K is\nconstructed by collecting and labeling over 20K images from 36 affordance\ncategories.

However, in\npractical implementation, the annealing process cannot be arbitrarily slow and\nhence, it may deviate from the expected stationary Boltzmann distribution and\nbecome trapped in a local energy minimum. To overcome this problem, this paper\nproposes a heuristic search algorithm by expanding search space from a Markov\nchain to a recursive depth limited tree based on SA, where the parent and child\nnodes represent the current and future spin states. At each iteration, the\nalgorithm will select the best near-optimal solution within the feasible search\nspace by exploring along the tree in the sense of `look ahead'. Furthermore,\nmotivated by coherent Ising machine (CIM), we relax the discrete representation\nof spin states to continuous representation with a regularization term and\nutilize the reduced dynamics of the oscillators to explore the surrounding\nneighborhood of the selected tree nodes. We tested our algorithm on a\nrepresentative NP-hard problem (MAX-CUT) to illustrate the effectiveness of\nthis algorithm compared to semi-definite programming (SDP), SA, and simulated\nCIM.

Thus, we do not incorporate any additional costs\nduring training or we do not decrease the performance on non-attacked inputs.\nWe validate our approach on a variety of datasets (MNIST, Fashion MNIST, Color\nMNIST, CelebA) and VAE configurations ($\\beta$-VAE, NVAE, TC-VAE) and show that\nit consistently improves the model robustness to adversarial attacks.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning with differential privacy, i.e. private federated learning\n(PFL), makes it possible to train models on private data distributed across\nusers' devices without harming privacy. PFL is efficient for models, such as\nneural networks, that have a fixed number of parameters, and thus a\nfixed-dimensional gradient vector. Such models include neural-net language\nmodels, but not tokenizers, the topic of this work. Training a tokenizer\nrequires frequencies of words from an unlimited vocabulary, and existing\nmethods for finding an unlimited vocabulary need a separate privacy budget.\nA workaround is to train the tokenizer on publicly available data. However,\nin this paper we first show that a tokenizer trained on mismatched data results\nin worse model performance compared to a privacy-violating \"oracle\" tokenizer\nthat accesses user data, with perplexity increasing by 20%. We also show that\nsub-word tokenizers are better suited to the federated context than word-level\nones, since they can encode new words, though with more tokens per word.\nSecond, we propose a novel method to obtain a tokenizer without using any\nadditional privacy budget. During private federated learning of the language\nmodel, we sample from the model, train a new tokenizer on the sampled\nsequences, and update the model embeddings. We then continue private federated\nlearning, and obtain performance within 1% of the \"oracle\" tokenizer. Since\nthis process trains the tokenizer only indirectly on private data, we can use\nthe \"postprocessing guarantee\" of differential privacy and thus use no\nadditional privacy budget.",

The dialogue state tracking (DST) module in the\nmedical dialogue system which interprets utterances into the machine-readable\nstructure for downstream tasks is particularly challenging. Firstly, the states\nneed to be able to represent compound entities such as symptoms with their body\npart or diseases with degrees of severity to provide enough information for\ndecision support. Secondly, these named entities in the utterance might be\ndiscontinuous and scattered across sentences and speakers. These also make it\ndifficult to annotate a large corpus which is essential for most methods.\nTherefore, we first define a multi-hierarchical state structure. We annotate\nand publish a medical dialogue dataset in Chinese. To the best of our\nknowledge, there are no publicly available ones before. Then we propose a\nPrompt-based Generative Approach which can generate slot values with\nmulti-hierarchies incrementally using a top-down approach.

    "abstract": "Environmental disturbances, such as sensor data noises, various lighting\nconditions, challenging weathers and external adversarial perturbations, are\ninevitable in real self-driving applications. Existing researches and testings\nhave shown that they can severely influence the vehicles perception ability and\nperformance, one of the main issue is the false positive detection, i.e., the\nghost object which is not real existed or occurs in the wrong position (such as\na non-existent vehicle). Traditional navigation methods tend to avoid every\ndetected objects for safety, however, avoiding a ghost object may lead the\nvehicle into a even more dangerous situation, such as a sudden break on the\nhighway. Considering the various disturbance types, it is difficult to address\nthis issue at the perceptual aspect. A potential solution is to detect the\nghost through relation learning among the whole scenario and develop an\nintegrated end-to-end navigation system. Our underlying logic is that the\nbehavior of all vehicles in the scene is influenced by their neighbors, and\nnormal vehicles behave in a logical way, while ghost vehicles do not. By\nlearning the spatio-temporal relation among surrounding vehicles, an\ninformation reliability representation is learned for each detected vehicle and\nthen a robot navigation network is developed. In contrast to existing works, we\nencourage the network to learn how to represent the reliability and how to\naggregate all the information with uncertainties by itself, thus increasing the\nefficiency and generalizability. To the best of the authors knowledge, this\npaper provides the first work on using graph relation learning to achieve\nend-to-end robust navigation in the presence of ghost vehicles.

Compared with fluent text generation,\ndisfluent text generation has not been widely explored. To generate more\nhuman-like texts, we addressed disfluent text generation. The usage of\ndisfluency, such as FPs, rephrases, and word fragments, differs from speaker to\nspeaker, and thus, the generation of personalized FPs is required. However, it\nis difficult to predict them because of the sparsity of position and the\nfrequency difference between more and less frequently used FPs. Moreover, it is\nsometimes difficult to adapt FP prediction models to each speaker because of\nthe large variation of the tendency within each speaker. To address these\nissues, we propose a method to build group-dependent prediction models by\ngrouping speakers on the basis of their tendency to use FPs. This method does\nnot require a large amount of data and time to train each speaker model. We\nfurther introduce a loss function and a word embedding model suitable for FP\nprediction. Our experimental results demonstrate that group-dependent models\ncan predict FPs with higher scores than a non-personalized one and the\nintroduced loss function and word embedding model improve the prediction\nperformance.",

To address this, we expand\nthe notion of proportionality, by proposing a quantitative framework which\nevaluates a budget aggregation mechanism according to its worst-case distance\nfrom the proportional allocation. Crucially, this is defined for every\npreference profile. We study this measure on the class of moving phantom\nmechanisms, and we provide approximation guarantees. For two projects, we show\nthat the Uniform Phantom mechanism is the optimal among all truthful\nmechanisms.

Because of its biochemical\ncharacteristics, synthetic DNA molecules are now considered as serious\ncandidates for this new kind of storage. This paper presents some results on\nlossy image compression methods based on convolutional autoencoders adapted to\nDNA data storage.\nThe model architectures presented here have been designed to efficiently\ncompress images, encode them into a quaternary code, and finally store them\ninto synthetic DNA molecules. This work also aims at making the compression\nmodels better fit the problematics that we encounter when storing data into\nDNA, namely the fact that the DNA writing, storing and reading methods are\nerror prone processes. The main take away of this kind of compressive\nautoencoder is our quantization and the robustness to substitution errors\nthanks to the noise model that we use during training.",

    "abstract": "Task-oriented personal assistants enable people to interact with a host of\ndevices and services using natural language. One of the challenges of making\nneural dialogue systems available to more users is the lack of training data\nfor all but a few languages. Zero-shot methods try to solve this issue by\nacquiring task knowledge in a high-resource language such as English with the\naim of transferring it to the low-resource language(s). To this end, we\nintroduce CrossAligner, the principal method of a variety of effective\napproaches for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer based on learning alignment\nfrom unlabelled parallel data. We present a quantitative analysis of individual\nmethods as well as their weighted combinations, several of which exceed\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) scores as evaluated across nine languages, fifteen test\nsets and three benchmark multilingual datasets. A detailed qualitative error\nanalysis of the best methods shows that our fine-tuned language models can\nzero-shot transfer the task knowledge better than anticipated.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we unify popular non-rigid registration methods for point sets\nand surfaces under our general framework, GiNGR. GiNGR builds upon Gaussian\nProcess Morphable Models (GPMM) and hence separates modeling the deformation\nprior from model adaptation for registration. In addition, it provides\nexplainable hyperparameters, multi-resolution registration, trivial inclusion\nof expert annotation, and the ability to use and combine analytical and\nstatistical deformation priors. But more importantly, the reformulation allows\nfor a direct comparison of registration methods. Instead of using a general\nsolver in the optimization step, we show how Gaussian process regression (GPR)\niteratively can warp a reference onto a target, leading to smooth deformations\nfollowing the prior for any dense, sparse, or partial estimated correspondences\nin a principled way. We show how the popular CPD and ICP algorithms can be\ndirectly explained with GiNGR. Furthermore, we show how existing algorithms in\nthe GiNGR framework can perform probabilistic registration to obtain a\ndistribution of different registrations instead of a single best registration.\nThis can be used to analyze the uncertainty e.g. when registering partial\nobservations. GiNGR is publicly available and fully modular to allow for\ndomain-specific prior construction.",

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral images of a scene or object are a rich data source, often\nencoding a hundred or more spectral bands of reflectance at each pixel. Despite\nbeing very high-dimensional, these images typically encode latent\nlow-dimensional structure that can be exploited for material discrimination.\nHowever, due to an inherent trade-off between spectral and spatial resolution,\nmany hyperspectral images are generated at a coarse spatial scale, and single\npixels may correspond to spatial regions containing multiple materials. This\narticle introduces the \\emph{Diffusion and Volume maximization-based Image\nClustering} (\\emph{D-VIC}) algorithm for unsupervised material discrimination.\nD-VIC locates cluster modes -- high-density, high-purity pixels in the\nhyperspectral image that are far in diffusion distance (a data-dependent\ndistance metric) from other high-density, high-purity pixels -- and assigns\nthese pixels unique labels, as these points are meant to exemplify underlying\nmaterial structure. Non-modal pixels are labeled according to their diffusion\ndistance nearest neighbor of higher density and purity that is already labeled.\nBy directly incorporating pixel purity into its modal and non-modal labeling,\nD-VIC upweights pixels that correspond to a spatial region containing just a\nsingle material, yielding more interpretable clusterings. D-VIC is shown to\noutperform baseline and comparable state-of-the-art methods in extensive\nnumerical experiments on a range of hyperspectral images, implying that it is\nwell-equipped for material discrimination and clustering of these data.",

    "title": "Elastica Models for Color Image Regularization",
    "abstract": "One classical approach to regularize color is to tream them as two\ndimensional surfaces embedded in a five dimensional spatial-chromatic space. In\nthis case, a natural regularization term arises as the image surface area.\nChoosing the chromatic coordinates as dominating over the spatial ones, the\nimage spatial coordinates could be thought of as a paramterization of the image\nsurface manifold in a three dimensional color space. Minimizing the area of the\nimage manifold leads to the Beltrami flow or mean curvature flow of the image\nsurface in the 3D color space, while minimizing the elastica of the image\nsurface yields an additional interesting regularization. Recently, the authors\nproposed a color elastica model, which minimizes both the surface area and\nelastica of the image manifold. In this paper, we propose to modify the color\nelastica and introduce two new models for color image regularization. The\nrevised measures are motivated by the relations between the color elastica\nmodel, Euler's elastica model and the total variation model for gray level\nimages. Compared to our previous color elastica model, the new models are\ndirect extensions of Euler's elastica model to color images. The proposed\nmodels are nonlinear and challenging to minimize. To overcome this difficulty,\ntwo operator-splitting methods are suggested. Specifically, nonlinearities are\ndecoupled by introducing new vector- and matrix-valued variables. Then, the\nminimization problems are converted to solving initial value problems which are\ntime-discretized by operator splitting. Each subproblem, after splitting\neither, has a closed-form solution or can be solved efficiently. The\neffectiveness and advantages of the proposed models are demonstrated by\ncomprehensive experiments. The benefits of incorporating the elastica of the\nimage surface as regularization terms compared to common alternatives are\nempirically validated.",

    "abstract": "Retrieving accurate semantic information in challenging high dynamic range\n(HDR) and high-speed conditions remains an open challenge for image-based\nalgorithms due to severe image degradations. Event cameras promise to address\nthese challenges since they feature a much higher dynamic range and are\nresilient to motion blur. Nonetheless, semantic segmentation with event cameras\nis still in its infancy which is chiefly due to the novelty of the sensor, and\nthe lack of high-quality, labeled datasets. In this work, we introduce ESS,\nwhich tackles this problem by directly transferring the semantic segmentation\ntask from existing labeled image datasets to unlabeled events via unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (UDA). Compared to existing UDA methods, our approach aligns\nrecurrent, motion-invariant event embeddings with image embeddings. For this\nreason, our method neither requires video data nor per-pixel alignment between\nimages and events and, crucially, does not need to hallucinate motion from\nstill images. Additionally, to spur further research in event-based semantic\nsegmentation, we introduce DSEC-Semantic, the first large-scale event-based\ndataset with fine-grained labels. We show that using image labels alone, ESS\noutperforms existing UDA approaches, and when combined with event labels, it\neven outperforms state-of-the-art supervised approaches on both DDD17 and\nDSEC-Semantic.

However, it is important to acknowledge that speakers and the\ncontent they produce and require, vary not just by language, but also by\nculture. Although language and culture are tightly linked, there are important\ndifferences. Analogous to cross-lingual and multilingual NLP, cross-cultural\nand multicultural NLP considers these differences in order to better serve\nusers of NLP systems. We propose a principled framework to frame these efforts,\nand survey existing and potential strategies.",

However, it often\nsuffers from severe class-bias problem while exploring the unlabelled images,\nlargely due to the clear pixel-wise class imbalance in the labelled images.\nThis paper presents an unbiased subclass regularization network (USRN) that\nalleviates the class imbalance issue by learning class-unbiased segmentation\nfrom balanced subclass distributions. We build the balanced subclass\ndistributions by clustering pixels of each original class into multiple\nsubclasses of similar sizes, which provide class-balanced pseudo supervision to\nregularize the class-biased segmentation. In addition, we design an\nentropy-based gate mechanism to coordinate learning between the original\nclasses and the clustered subclasses which facilitates subclass regularization\neffectively by suppressing unconfident subclass predictions.

    "abstract": "Recently, many collaborative representation-based (CR) algorithms have been\nproposed for hyperspectral anomaly detection. CR-based detectors approximate\nthe image by a linear combination of background dictionaries and the\ncoefficient matrix, and derive the detection map by utilizing recovery\nresiduals. However, these CR-based detectors are often established on the\npremise of precise background features and strong image representation, which\nare very difficult to obtain. In addition, pursuing the coefficient matrix\nreinforced by the general $l_2$-min is very time consuming. To address these\nissues, a nonnegative-constrained joint collaborative representation model is\nproposed in this paper for the hyperspectral anomaly detection task. To extract\nreliable samples, a union dictionary consisting of background and anomaly\nsub-dictionaries is designed, where the background sub-dictionary is obtained\nat the superpixel level and the anomaly sub-dictionary is extracted by the\npre-detection process. And the coefficient matrix is jointly optimized by the\nFrobenius norm regularization with a nonnegative constraint and a sum-to-one\nconstraint. After the optimization process, the abnormal information is finally\nderived by calculating the residuals that exclude the assumed background\ninformation. To conduct comparable experiments, the proposed\nnonnegative-constrained joint collaborative representation (NJCR) model and its\nkernel version (KNJCR) are tested in four HSI data sets and achieve superior\nresults compared with other state-of-the-art detectors.",

    "abstract": "The generalization mystery in deep learning is the following: Why do\nover-parameterized neural networks trained with gradient descent (GD)\ngeneralize well on real datasets even though they are capable of fitting random\ndatasets of comparable size? Furthermore, from among all solutions that fit the\ntraining data, how does GD find one that generalizes well (when such a\nwell-generalizing solution exists)?\nWe argue that the answer to both questions lies in the interaction of the\ngradients of different examples during training. Intuitively, if the\nper-example gradients are well-aligned, that is, if they are coherent, then one\nmay expect GD to be (algorithmically) stable, and hence generalize well. We\nformalize this argument with an easy to compute and interpretable metric for\ncoherence, and show that the metric takes on very different values on real and\nrandom datasets for several common vision networks. The theory also explains a\nnumber of other phenomena in deep learning, such as why some examples are\nreliably learned earlier than others, why early stopping works, and why it is\npossible to learn from noisy labels. Moreover, since the theory provides a\ncausal explanation of how GD finds a well-generalizing solution when one\nexists, it motivates a class of simple modifications to GD that attenuate\nmemorization and improve generalization.\nGeneralization in deep learning is an extremely broad phenomenon, and\ntherefore, it requires an equally general explanation. We conclude with a\nsurvey of alternative lines of attack on this problem, and argue that the\nproposed approach is the most viable one on this basis.",

The two major\nclasses of MET alterations are gene amplification and exon 14 deletion, both of\nwhich are therapeutic targets and detectable using existing molecular assays.\nHowever, existing tests are limited by their consumption of valuable tissue,\ncost and complexity that prevent widespread use. MET alterations could have an\neffect on cell morphology, and quantifying these associations could open new\navenues for research and development of morphology-based screening tools. Using\nH&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs), we investigated the association of\ndistinct cell-morphological features with MET amplifications and MET exon 14\ndeletions. We found that cell shape, color, grayscale intensity and\ntexture-based features from both tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor cells\ndistinguished MET wild-type from MET amplified or MET exon 14 deletion cases.\nThe association of individual cell features with MET alterations suggested a\npredictive model could distinguish MET wild-type from MET amplification or MET\nexon 14 deletion. We therefore developed an L1-penalized logistic regression\nmodel, achieving a mean Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve\n(ROC-AUC) of 0.77 +/- 0.05sd in cross-validation and 0.77 on an independent\nholdout test set.

Our study demonstrates that\nMET alterations result in a detectable morphological signal in tumor cells and\nlymphocytes. These results suggest that development of low-cost predictive\nmodels based on H&E-stained WSIs may improve screening for MET altered tumors.",

I.e., a preprocessing\nroutine that in polynomial time outputs an equivalent instance of size\n$t^{O(1)}$. However, this proof is non-constructive, meaning that this proof\ndoes not yield an explicit bound on the kernel size. The $\\{K_4\\}$-Minor Cover\nproblem is the simplest variant of the $\\mathcal{F}$-Minor Cover problem with\nan unknown kernel size.\nTo develop a constructive kernelization algorithm, we present a new method to\ndecompose graphs into near-protrusions, such that near-protrusions in this new\ndecomposition can be reduced using elementary reduction rules. Our method\nextends the `approximation and tidying' framework by van Bevern et al.\n[Algorithmica 2012] to provide guarantees stronger than those provided by both\nthis framework and a regular protrusion decomposition. Furthermore, we provide\nextensions of the elementary reduction rules used by the $\\{K_4,\nK_{2,3}\\}$-Minor Cover kernelization algorithm introduced by Donkers et al.\n[IPEC 2021].\nUsing the new decomposition method and reduction rules, we obtain a kernel\nconsisting of $O(t^{41})$ vertices, which is the first constructive kernel.\nThis kernel is a step towards more concrete kernelization bounds for the\n$\\mathcal{F}$-Minor Cover problem where $\\mathcal{F}$ contains a planar graph,\nand our decomposition provides a potential direction to achieve these new\nbounds.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of audio source separation where the goal is\nto isolate a target audio signal (say Alice's speech) from a mixture of\nmultiple interfering signals (e.g., when many people are talking). This problem\nhas gained renewed interest mainly due to the significant growth in voice\ncontrolled devices, including robots in homes, offices, and other public\nfacilities. Although a rich body of work exists on the core topic of source\nseparation, we find that robotic motion of the microphone -- say the robot's\nhead -- is a complementary opportunity to past approaches. Briefly, we show\nthat rotating the microphone array to the correct orientation can produce\ndesired aliasing between two interferers, causing the two interferers to pose\nas one. In other words, a mixture of K signals becomes a mixture of (K-1), a\nmathematically concrete gain. We show that the gain translates well to practice\nprovided two mobility-related challenges can be mitigated. This paper is\nfocused on mitigating these challenges and demonstrating the end-to-end\nperformance on a fully functional prototype. We believe that our Rotational\nSource Separation module RoSS could be plugged into actual robot heads, or into\nother devices (like Amazon Show) that are also capable of rotation.",

    "abstract": "Onboard localization capabilities for planetary rovers to date have used\nrelative navigation, by integrating combinations of wheel odometry, visual\nodometry, and inertial measurements during each drive to track position\nrelative to the start of each drive. At the end of each drive, a\nground-in-the-loop (GITL) interaction is used to get a position update from\nhuman operators in a more global reference frame, by matching images or local\nmaps from onboard the rover to orbital reconnaissance images or maps of a large\nregion around the rover's current position. Autonomous rover drives are limited\nin distance so that accumulated relative navigation error does not risk the\npossibility of the rover driving into hazards known from orbital images.\nHowever, several rover mission concepts have recently been studied that require\nmuch longer drives between GITL cycles, particularly for the Moon. These\nconcepts require greater autonomy to minimize GITL cycles to enable such large\nrange; onboard global localization is a key element of such autonomy. Multiple\ntechniques have been studied in the past for onboard rover global localization,\nbut a satisfactory solution has not yet emerged. For the Moon, the ubiquitous\ncraters offer a new possibility, which involves mapping craters from orbit,\nthen recognizing crater landmarks with cameras and-or a lidar onboard the\nrover. This approach is applicable everywhere on the Moon, does not require\nhigh resolution stereo imaging from orbit as some other approaches do, and has\npotential to enable position knowledge with order of 5 to 10 m accuracy at all\ntimes. This paper describes our technical approach to crater-based lunar rover\nlocalization and presents initial results on crater detection using 3D point\ncloud data from onboard lidar or stereo cameras, as well as using shading cues\nin monocular onboard imagery.",

They potentially offer\nhigher energy efficiency and computational speed when compared to their\nelectronic counterparts. By utilizing tunable phase shifters, one can adjust\nthe output of each of MZIs in order to enable emulation of arbitrary\nmatrix-vector multiplication. These phase shifters are central to the\nprogrammability of ONNs, but they require large footprint and are relatively\nslow.

Instead of modulating phase,\ngain/loss contrasts across the array are adjusted as a means to train the\nnetwork. We demonstrate that PT symmetric optical neural networks (PT-ONN) are\nadequately expressive by performing the digit-recognition task on the modified\nnational institute of standard and technology (MNIST) dataset. Compared to\nconventional ONNs, the PT-ONN achieves a comparable accuracy (67% vs. 71%)\nwhile circumventing the problems associated with changing phase.

    "abstract": "In classical cosmological analysis of large scale structure surveys with 2-pt\nfunctions, the parameter measurement precision is limited by several key\ndegeneracies within the cosmology and astrophysics sectors. For cosmic shear,\nclustering amplitude $\\sigma_8$ and matter density $\\Omega_m$ roughly follow\nthe $S_8=\\sigma_8(\\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$ relation. In turn, $S_8$ is highly\ncorrelated with the intrinsic galaxy alignment amplitude $A_{\\rm{IA}}$. For\ngalaxy clustering, the bias $b_g$ is degenerate with both $\\sigma_8$ and\n$\\Omega_m$, as well as the stochasticity $r_g$. Moreover, the redshift\nevolution of IA and bias can cause further parameter confusion. A tomographic\n2-pt probe combination can partially lift these degeneracies. In this work we\ndemonstrate that a deep learning analysis of combined probes of weak\ngravitational lensing and galaxy clustering, which we call DeepLSS, can\neffectively break these degeneracies and yield significantly more precise\nconstraints on $\\sigma_8$, $\\Omega_m$, $A_{\\rm{IA}}$, $b_g$, $r_g$, and IA\nredshift evolution parameter $\\eta_{\\rm{IA}}$. The most significant gains are\nin the IA sector: the precision of $A_{\\rm{IA}}$ is increased by approximately\n8x and is almost perfectly decorrelated from $S_8$. Galaxy bias $b_g$ is\nimproved by 1.5x, stochasticity $r_g$ by 3x, and the redshift evolution\n$\\eta_{\\rm{IA}}$ and $\\eta_b$ by 1.6x. Breaking these degeneracies leads to a\nsignificant gain in constraining power for $\\sigma_8$ and $\\Omega_m$, with the\nfigure of merit improved by 15x. We give an intuitive explanation for the\norigin of this information gain using sensitivity maps. These results indicate\nthat the fully numerical, map-based forward modeling approach to cosmological\ninference with machine learning may play an important role in upcoming LSS\nsurveys.

In this work, we argue that data compression mechanisms\nand entropy quantizers should be co-designed with the sensing goal,\nspecifically for machine-consumed data. To this end, we propose a novel deep\nlearning-based framework for compressing and quantizing the observations of\ncorrelated sensors. Instead of maximizing the reconstruction fidelity, our\nobjective is to compress the sensor observations in a way that maximizes the\naccuracy of the inferred decision (i.e., sensing goal) at the FC.

We show here that under the assumption of the existence of a\nFourier-like Hilbert basis for the kernel of the Ruelle operator there exists\ngeodesics paths. When $T=\\sigma$ and $M=\\{0,1\\}^\\mathbb{N}$ such basis exists.\nIn a different direction, we also consider the KL-divergence\n$D_{KL}(\\mu_1,\\mu_2)$ for a pair of equilibrium probabilities.

This minimization problem is a dynamical\nversion of the main issues considered in information projections.

Here we consider an extended model in which the\ncompression of the job processing times is allowed. The compression is\naccomplished at the cost of involving additional emerging resources, whose use,\nhowever, yields some cost. With a given upper limit $U$ on the total allowable\ncost, one wishes to minimize the maximum job lateness. This setting is\nrealistic in practice because by completing some emerging jobs earlier using\nsome available resources, the objective function value might be decreased. In\nparticular, for minimizing the maximum job lateness, shortening the processing\ntime of specific jobs turns out to be very helpful. Although the generalized\nproblem remains strongly NP-hard and is considerably more complicated than the\ngeneric non-compressible version, given a \"sufficient amount\" of additional\nresources, it might be possible to solve the problem optimally. In particular,\nwe establish the compression rate for some specific jobs and develop an\nalgorithm that obtains an optimal solution for the processing times reduced in\nthis way.

Then, a change\nof ordering algorithm, such as \\textsf{Sparse-FGLM}, designed by Faug\\`ere and\nMou, is used to find a Gr\\\"obner basis of the same ideal but with respect to a\nlexicographic ordering. The complexity of this latter step, in terms of\narithmetic operations, is $O(mD^2)$, where $D$ is the degree of the ideal and\n$m$ is the number of non-trivial columns of a certain $D \\times D$ matrix.\nWhile asymptotic estimates are known for $m$ for generic polynomial systems,\nthus far, the complexity of \\textsf{Sparse-FGLM} was unknown for determinantal\nsystems.\nBy assuming Fr\\\"oberg's conjecture we expand the work of Moreno-Soc\\'ias by\ndetailing the structure of the DRL staircase in the determinantal setting. Then\nwe study the asymptotics of the quantity $m$ by relating it to the coefficients\nof these Hilbert series. Consequently, we arrive at a new bound on the\ncomplexity of the \\textsf{Sparse-FGLM} algorithm for generic determinantal\nsystems and for generic critical point systems. We consider the ideal in the\npolynomial ring $\\mathbb{K}[x_1, \\dots, x_n]$, where $\\mathbb{K}$ is some\ninfinite field, generated by $p$ generic polynomials of degree $d$ and the\nmaximal minors of a $p \\times (n-1)$ polynomial matrix with generic entries of\ndegree $d-1$. Then for the case $d=2$ and for $n \\gg p$ we give an exact\nformula for $m$ in terms of $n$ and $p$. Moreover, for $d \\geq 3$, we give an\nasymptotic formula, as $n \\to \\infty$, for $m$ in terms of $n,p$ and $d$.",

    "abstract": "A fluid-structure interaction model in a port-Hamiltonian representation is\nderived for a classical guitar. We combine the laws of continuum mechanics for\nsolids and fluids within a unified port-Hamiltonian (pH) modeling approach by\nadapting the discretized equations on second-order level in order to obtain a\ndamped multi-physics model. The high-dimensionality of the resulting system is\nreduced by model order reduction. The article focuses on pH-systems in\ndifferent state transformations, a variety of basis generation techniques as\nwell as structure-preserving model order reduction approaches that are\nindependent from the projection basis. As main contribution a thorough\ncomparison of these method combinations is conducted. In contrast to typical\nfrequency-based simulations in acoustics, transient time simulations of the\nsystem are presented. The approach is embedded into a straightforward workflow\nof sophisticated commercial software modeling and flexible in-house software\nfor multi-physics coupling and model order reduction.",
