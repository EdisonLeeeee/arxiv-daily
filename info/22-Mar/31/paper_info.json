    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are de facto node classification models in graph\nstructured data. However, during testing-time, these algorithms assume no data\nshift, i.e., $\\Pr_\\text{train}(X,Y) = \\Pr_\\text{test}(X,Y)$. Domain adaption\nmethods can be adopted for data shift, yet most of them are designed to only\nencourage similar feature distribution between source and target data.\nConditional shift on classes can still affect such adaption. Fortunately, graph\nyields graph homophily across different data distributions. In response, we\npropose Shift-Robust Node Classification (SRNC) to address these limitations.\nWe introduce an unsupervised cluster GNN on target graph to group the similar\nnodes by graph homophily. An adversarial loss with label information on source\ngraph is used upon clustering objective. Then a shift-robust classifier is\noptimized on training graph and adversarial samples on target graph, which are\ngenerated by cluster GNN. We conduct experiments on both open-set shift and\nrepresentation-shift, which demonstrates the superior accuracy of SRNC on\ngeneralizing to test graph with data shift. SRNC is consistently better than\nprevious SoTA domain adaption algorithm on graph that progressively use model\npredictions on target graph for training.",

    "abstract": "Thyroid cancer is a common endocrine carcinoma that occurs in the thyroid\ngland. Much effort has been invested in improving its diagnosis, and\nthyroidectomy remains the primary treatment method. A successful operation\nwithout unnecessary side injuries relies on an accurate preoperative diagnosis.\nCurrent human assessment of thyroid nodule malignancy is prone to errors and\nmay not guarantee an accurate preoperative diagnosis. This study proposed a\nmachine framework to predict thyroid nodule malignancy based on a novel\nclinical dataset we collected. The 10-fold cross-validation, bootstrap\nanalysis, and permutation predictor importance were applied to estimate and\ninterpret the model performance under uncertainty. The comparison between model\nprediction and expert assessment shows the advantage of our framework over\nhuman judgment in predicting thyroid nodule malignancy. Our method is accurate,\ninterpretable, and thus useable as additional evidence in the preoperative\ndiagnosis for thyroid cancer.",

Silicon photonic integrated chips\n(PICs), by employing coherent interactions in Mach-Zehnder interferometers, are\npromising accelerators offering record low power consumption and ultra-fast\nmatrix multiplication. Such photonic accelerators, however, suffer from phase\nuncertainty due to fabrication errors and crosstalk effects that inhibit the\ndevelopment of high-density implementations. In this work, we present a\nBayesian learning framework for such photonic accelerators. In addition to the\nconventional log-likelihood optimization path, two novel training schemes are\nderived, namely a regularized version and a fully Bayesian learning scheme.\nThey are applied on a photonic neural network with 512 phase shifters targeting\nthe MNIST dataset. The new schemes, when combined with a pre-characterization\nstage that provides the passive offsets, are able to dramatically decrease the\noperational power of the PIC beyond 70%, with just a slight loss in\nclassification accuracy. The full Bayesian scheme, apart from this energy\nreduction, returns information with respect to the sensitivity of the phase\nshifters. This information is used to de-activate 31% of the phase actuators\nand, thus, significantly simplify the driving system.",

    "abstract": "Emotion is an experience associated with a particular pattern of\nphysiological activity along with different physiological, behavioral and\ncognitive changes. One behavioral change is facial expression, which has been\nstudied extensively over the past few decades. Facial behavior varies with a\nperson's emotion according to differences in terms of culture, personality,\nage, context, and environment. In recent years, physiological activities have\nbeen used to study emotional responses. A typical signal is the\nelectroencephalogram (EEG), which measures brain activity. Most of existing\nEEG-based emotion analysis has overlooked the role of facial expression\nchanges. There exits little research on the relationship between facial\nbehavior and brain signals due to the lack of dataset measuring both EEG and\nfacial action signals simultaneously. To address this problem, we propose to\ndevelop a new database by collecting facial expressions, action units, and EEGs\nsimultaneously. We recorded the EEGs and face videos of both posed facial\nactions and spontaneous expressions from 29 participants with different ages,\ngenders, ethnic backgrounds. Differing from existing approaches, we designed a\nprotocol to capture the EEG signals by evoking participants' individual action\nunits explicitly. We also investigated the relation between the EEG signals and\nfacial action units. As a baseline, the database has been evaluated through the\nexperiments on both posed and spontaneous emotion recognition with images\nalone, EEG alone, and EEG fused with images, respectively. The database will be\nreleased to the research community to advance the state of the art for\nautomatic emotion recognition.",

Heatmap-based Regression\n(HBR) and Coordinate-based Regression (CBR) are among the two mainly used\nmethods for face alignment. CBR methods require less computer memory, though\ntheir performance is less than HBR methods. In this paper, we propose an\nAdaptive Coordinate-based Regression (ACR) loss to improve the accuracy of CBR\nfor face alignment. Inspired by the Active Shape Model (ASM), we generate\nSmooth-Face objects, a set of facial landmark points with less variations\ncompared to the ground truth landmark points. We then introduce a method to\nestimate the level of difficulty in predicting each landmark point for the\nnetwork by comparing the distribution of the ground truth landmark points and\nthe corresponding Smooth-Face objects. Our proposed ACR Loss can adaptively\nmodify its curvature and the influence of the loss based on the difficulty\nlevel of predicting each landmark point in a face. Accordingly, the ACR Loss\nguides the network toward challenging points than easier points, which improves\nthe accuracy of the face alignment task.

This hashing reduces the\nnumber of unique representations that must be stored in the embedding table;\nthus decreasing its size.

We experiment with this technique on a production model and find that\na mapping informed by the combination of access frequency and a learned low\ndimension embedding is the most effective.

In such a system, a NN controller\nprocesses images from a camera to guide the aircraft while approaching the\nrunway. A central challenge for the safety and liveness verification of\nvision-based closed-loop systems is the lack of mathematical models that\ncaptures the relation between the system states (e.g., position of the\naircraft) and the images processed by the vision-based NN controller. Another\nchallenge is the limited abilities of state-of-the-art NN model checkers. Such\nmodel checkers can reason only about simple input-output robustness properties\nof neural networks. This limitation creates a gap between the NN model checker\nabilities and the need to verify a closed-loop system while considering the\naircraft dynamics, the perception components, and the NN controller. To this\nend, this paper presents NNLander-VeriF, a framework to verify vision-based NN\ncontrollers used for autonomous landing. NNLander-VeriF addresses the\nchallenges above by exploiting geometric models of perspective cameras to\nobtain a mathematical model that captures the relation between the aircraft\nstates and the inputs to the NN controller. By converting this model into a NN\n(with manually assigned weights) and composing it with the NN controller, one\ncan capture the relation between aircraft states and control actions using one\naugmented NN. Such an augmented NN model leads to a natural encoding of the\nclosed-loop verification into several NN robustness queries, which\nstate-of-the-art NN model checkers can handle. Finally, we evaluate our\nframework to formally verify the properties of a trained NN and we show its\nefficiency.",

We developed a solution, dubbed neural inertial\nlocalization (NILoc) which 1) uses a neural inertial navigation technique to\nturn inertial sensor history to a sequence of velocity vectors; then 2) employs\na transformer-based neural architecture to find the device location from the\nsequence of velocities. We only use an IMU sensor, which is energy efficient\nand privacy preserving compared to WiFi, cameras, and other data sources. Our\napproach is significantly faster and achieves competitive results even compared\nwith state-of-the-art methods that require a floorplan and run 20 to 30 times\nslower.

    "abstract": "Restless bandits are an important class of problems with applications in\nrecommender systems, active learning, revenue management and other areas. We\nconsider infinite-horizon discounted restless bandits with many arms where a\nfixed proportion of arms may be pulled in each period and where arms share a\nfinite state space. Although an average-case-optimal policy can be computed via\nstochastic dynamic programming, the computation required grows exponentially\nwith the number of arms $N$. Thus, it is important to find scalable policies\nthat can be computed efficiently for large $N$ and that are near optimal in\nthis regime, in the sense that the optimality gap (i.e. the loss of expected\nperformance against an optimal policy) per arm vanishes for large $N$. However,\nthe most popular approach, the Whittle index, requires a hard-to-verify\nindexability condition to be well-defined and another hard-to-verify condition\nto guarantee a $o(N)$ optimality gap. We present a method resolving these\ndifficulties. By replacing a global Lagrange multiplier used by the Whittle\nindex with a sequence of Lagrangian multipliers, one per time period up to a\nfinite truncation point, we derive a class of policies, called fluid-balance\npolicies, that have a $O(\\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap. Unlike the Whittle index,\nfluid-balance policies do not require indexability to be well-defined and their\n$O(\\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap bound holds universally without sufficient\nconditions. We also demonstrate empirically that fluid-balance policies provide\nstate-of-the-art performance on specific problems.",

    "abstract": "Despite the progress in legged robotic locomotion, autonomous navigation in\nunknown environments remains an open problem. Ideally, the navigation system\nutilizes the full potential of the robots' locomotion capabilities while\noperating within safety limits under uncertainty. The robot must sense and\nanalyze the traversability of the surrounding terrain, which depends on the\nhardware, locomotion control, and terrain properties. It may contain\ninformation about the risk, energy, or time consumption needed to traverse the\nterrain. To avoid hand-crafted traversability cost functions we propose to\ncollect traversability information about the robot and locomotion policy by\nsimulating the traversal over randomly generated terrains using a physics\nsimulator. Thousand of robots are simulated in parallel controlled by the same\nlocomotion policy used in reality to acquire 57 years of real-world locomotion\nexperience equivalent. For deployment on the real robot, a sparse convolutional\nnetwork is trained to predict the simulated traversability cost, which is\ntailored to the deployed locomotion policy, from an entirely geometric\nrepresentation of the environment in the form of a 3D voxel-occupancy map. This\nrepresentation avoids the need for commonly used elevation maps, which are\nerror-prone in the presence of overhanging obstacles and multi-floor or\nlow-ceiling scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed traversability\nprediction network is demonstrated for path planning for the legged robot\nANYmal in various indoor and natural environments.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has remarkably advanced in the last few years, supported by\nlarge labeled data sets. These data sets are precious yet scarce because of the\ntime-consuming labeling procedures, discouraging researchers from producing\nthem. This scarcity is especially true in dentistry, where deep learning\napplications are still in an embryonic stage. Motivated by this background, we\naddress in this study the construction of a public data set of dental panoramic\nradiographs. Our objects of interest are the teeth, which are segmented and\nnumbered, as they are the primary targets for dentists when screening a\npanoramic radiograph. We benefited from the human-in-the-loop (HITL) concept to\nexpedite the labeling procedure, using predictions from deep neural networks as\nprovisional labels, later verified by human annotators. All the gathering and\nlabeling procedures of this novel data set is thoroughly analyzed. The results\nwere consistent and behaved as expected: At each HITL iteration, the model\npredictions improved. Our results demonstrated a 51% labeling time reduction\nusing HITL, saving us more than 390 continuous working hours. In a novel online\nplatform, called OdontoAI, created to work as task central for this novel data\nset, we released 4,000 images, from which 2,000 have their labels publicly\navailable for model fitting. The labels of the other 2,000 images are private\nand used for model evaluation considering instance and semantic segmentation\nand numbering. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest-scale publicly\navailable data set for panoramic radiographs, and the OdontoAI is the first\nplatform of its kind in dentistry.",

Existing work focuses on improving NICG model accuracy while\nefficiency is less explored. However, many real-world applications require\nreal-time feedback, which highly relies on the efficiency of NICG models.\nRecent research observed that the efficiency of NICG models could vary for\ndifferent inputs. This observation brings in a new attack surface of NICG\nmodels, i.e., An adversary might be able to slightly change inputs to cause the\nNICG models to consume more computational resources. To further understand such\nefficiency-oriented threats, we propose a new attack approach, NICGSlowDown, to\nevaluate the efficiency robustness of NICG models. Our experimental results\nshow that NICGSlowDown can generate images with human-unnoticeable\nperturbations that will increase the NICG model latency up to 483.86%.

We show that even perfect\nestimates of the mean effort will not lead to an expectation of zero estimation\nbias when applying the frequently used bias measure: (actual effort - estimated\neffort)/actual effort. This measure will instead reward under-estimates of the\nmean effort. We also provide examples of bias measures that match estimates of\nthe mean and the median effort, and argue that there are, in general, no\npractical bias measures for estimates of the most likely effort.

Therefore, much of the recent\nattention has shifted towards semi and (or) weakly supervised learning.\nGenerating an effective form of supervision with little annotations still poses\nmajor challenges in crowded scenes. However, since it is easy to observe a\nscene from multiple cameras, we propose to impose multi-view geometrical\nconstraints by means of a differentiable triangulation and to use it as form of\nself-supervision during training when no labels are available. We therefore\ntrain a 2D pose estimator in such a way that its predictions correspond to the\nre-projection of the triangulated 3D one and train an auxiliary network on them\nto produce the final 3D poses. We complement the triangulation with a weighting\nmechanism that nullify the impact of noisy predictions caused by self-occlusion\nor occlusion from other subjects. Our experimental results on Human3.6M and\nMPI-INF-3DHP substantiate the significance of our weighting strategy where we\nobtain state-of-the-art results in the semi and weakly supervised learning\nsetup.

    "abstract": "Image manipulation detection algorithms are often trained to discriminate\nbetween images manipulated with particular Generative Models (GMs) and\ngenuine/real images, yet generalize poorly to images manipulated with GMs\nunseen in the training. Conventional detection algorithms receive an input\nimage passively. By contrast, we propose a proactive scheme to image\nmanipulation detection. Our key enabling technique is to estimate a set of\ntemplates which when added onto the real image would lead to more accurate\nmanipulation detection. That is, a template protected real image, and its\nmanipulated version, is better discriminated compared to the original real\nimage vs. its manipulated one. These templates are estimated using certain\nconstraints based on the desired properties of templates. For image\nmanipulation detection, our proposed approach outperforms the prior work by an\naverage precision of 16% for CycleGAN and 32% for GauGAN. Our approach is\ngeneralizable to a variety of GMs showing an improvement over prior work by an\naverage precision of 10% averaged across 12 GMs. Our code is available at\nhttps://www.github.com/vishal3477/proactive_IMD.",

    "abstract": "In classification problems, supervised machine-learning methods outperform\ntraditional algorithms, thanks to the ability of neural networks to learn\ncomplex patterns. However, in two-class classification tasks like anomaly or\nfraud detection, unsupervised methods could do even better, because their\nprediction is not limited to previously learned types of anomalies. An\nintuitive approach of anomaly detection can be based on the distances from the\ncenters of mass of the two respective classes. Autoencoders, although trained\nwithout supervision, can also detect anomalies: considering the center of mass\nof the normal points, reconstructions have now radii, with largest radii most\nlikely indicating anomalous points. Of course, radii-based classification were\nalready possible without interposing an autoencoder. In any space, radial\nclassification can be operated, to some extent. In order to outperform it, we\nproceed to radial deformations of data (i.e. centric compression or expansions\nof axes) and autoencoder training. Any autoencoder that makes use of a data\ncenter is here baptized a centric autoencoder (cAE). A special type is the cAE\ntrained with a uniformly compressed dataset, named the centripetal autoencoder\n(cpAE). The new concept is studied here in relation with a schematic artificial\ndataset, and the derived methods show consistent score improvements. But tested\non real banking data, our radial deformation supervised algorithms alone still\nperform better that cAEs, as expected from most supervised methods;\nnonetheless, in hybrid approaches, cAEs can be combined with a radial\ndeformation of space, improving its classification score. We expect that\ncentric autoencoders will become irreplaceable objects in anomaly live\ndetection based on geometry, thanks to their ability to stem naturally on\ngeometrical algorithms and to their native capability of detecting unknown\nanomaly types.",

We show that the existence of such barrier\nfunctions implies invariance in a coherent risk sense. Furthermore, we\nformulate conditions based on finite-time RCBFs to guarantee finite-time\nreachability to a desired set in the coherent risk. Conditions for\nrisk-sensitive safety and finite-time reachability of sets composed of Boolean\ncompositions of multiple RCBF are also formulated.

The problems are discretized\nby a spatially adaptive high-order meshless method, the generalized moving\nleast squares (GMLS) with adaptive $h$-refinement. In Stokes limit, solid\nkinematics can be dominated by the singularities governing the lubrication\neffects. Resolving those singularities with adaptive $h$-refinement can lead to\nan ill-conditioned linear system of equations. For constructing the\ninterpolation and restriction operators - the key ingredients of the multigrid\npreconditioner, we utilize the geometric information of hierarchical sets of\nGMLS nodes generated in adaptive $h$-refinement. We build decoupled smoothers\nthrough physics-based splitting and then combine them via a multiplicative\noverlapping Schwarz approach. Through numerical examples with the inclusion of\ndifferent numbers and shapes of solid bodies, we demonstrate the performance\nand assess the scalability of the designed preconditioner. As the total degrees\nof freedom and the number of solid bodies $N_s$ increase, the proposed\nmonolithic geometric multigrid preconditioner can ensure convergence and good\nscalability when using the Krylov iterative method for solving the linear\nsystems of equations generated from the spatially adaptive GMLS discretization.\nMore specifically, for a fixed number of solid bodies, as the discretization\nresolution is incrementally refined, the number of iterations of the linear\nsolver can be maintained at the same level, indicating nearly linear\nscalability of our preconditioner with respect to the total degrees of freedom.\nWhen $N_s$ increases, the number of iterations is nearly proportional to\n$\\sqrt{N_s}$, implying the sublinear optimality with respect to the number of\nsolid bodies.",

Images are synthesized by rendering the volumes from a given camera.\nThese models can disentangle the 3D scene from the camera viewpoint in any\ngenerated image. However, most models do not disentangle other factors of image\nformation, such as geometry and appearance. In this paper, we design a 3D GAN\nwhich can learn a disentangled model of objects, just from monocular\nobservations. Our model can disentangle the geometry and appearance variations\nin the scene, i.e., we can independently sample from the geometry and\nappearance spaces of the generative model. This is achieved using a novel\nnon-rigid deformable scene formulation. A 3D volume which represents an object\ninstance is computed as a non-rigidly deformed canonical 3D volume. Our method\nlearns the canonical volume, as well as its deformations, jointly during\ntraining. This formulation also helps us improve the disentanglement between\nthe 3D scene and the camera viewpoints using a novel pose regularization loss\ndefined on the 3D deformation field. In addition, we further model the inverse\ndeformations, enabling the computation of dense correspondences between images\ngenerated by our model.

More\nspecifically, (i) 73% of private transactions hide trading activity or\nre-distribute miner rewards, and 87.6% of MEV collection is accomplished with\nprivately submitted transactions, (ii) our algorithm finds more than $6M worth\nof MEV profit in a period of 12 days, two thirds of which go directly to\nminers, and (iii) MEV represents 9.2% of miners' profit from transaction fees.\nFurthermore, in those 12 days, we also identify four blocks that contain\nenough MEV profits to make time-bandit forking attacks economically viable for\nlarge miners, undermining the security and stability of Ethereum as a whole.",

    "abstract": "Recently, increasing attention has been devoted to the graph few-shot\nlearning problem, where the target novel classes only contain a few labeled\nnodes. Among many existing endeavors, episodic meta-learning has become the\nmost prevailing paradigm, and its episodic emulation of the test environment is\nbelieved to equip the graph neural network models with adaptability to novel\nnode classes. However, in the image domain, recent results have shown that\nfeature reuse is more likely to be the key of meta-learning to few-shot\nextrapolation. Based on such observation, in this work, we propose a simple\ntransductive fine-tuning based framework as a new paradigm for graph few-shot\nlearning. In the proposed paradigm, a graph encoder backbone is pretrained with\nbase classes, and a simple linear classifier is fine-tuned by the few labeled\nsamples and is tasked to classify the unlabeled ones. For pretraining, we\npropose a supervised contrastive learning framework with data augmentation\nstrategies specific for few-shot node classification to improve the\nextrapolation of a GNN encoder. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on\nthree benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior advantage of our framework\nover the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Tactile sensing typically involves active exploration of unknown surfaces and\nobjects, making it especially effective at processing the characteristics of\nmaterials and textures. A key property extracted by human tactile perception is\nsurface roughness, which relies on measuring vibratory signals using the\nmulti-layered fingertip structure. Existing robotic systems lack tactile\nsensors that are able to provide high dynamic sensing ranges, perceive material\nproperties, and maintain a low hardware cost. In this work, we introduce the\nreference design and fabrication procedure of a miniature and low-cost tactile\nsensor consisting of a biomimetic cutaneous structure, including the artificial\nfingerprint, dermis, epidermis, and an embedded magnet-sensor structure which\nserves as a mechanoreceptor for converting mechanical information to digital\nsignals. The presented sensor is capable of detecting high-resolution magnetic\nfield data through the Hall effect and creating high-dimensional time-frequency\ndomain features for material texture classification. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the effects of different superficial sensor fingerprint patterns\nfor classifying materials through both simulation and physical experimentation.\nAfter extracting time series and frequency domain features, we assess a\nk-nearest neighbors classifier for distinguishing between different materials.\nThe results from our experiments show that our biomimetic tactile sensors with\nfingerprint ridges can classify materials with more than 8% higher accuracy and\nlower variability than ridge-less sensors. These results, along with the low\ncost and customizability of our sensor, demonstrate high potential for lowering\nthe barrier to entry for a wide array of robotic applications, including\nmodel-less tactile sensing for texture classification, material inspection, and\nobject recognition.",

We observe that shadows are a powerful cue that\ncan constrain neural scene representations to learn SfS, and even outperform\nNeRF to reconstruct otherwise hidden geometry.

Much of the earlier work in representation\nlearning for reinforcement learning focused on designing fixed-basis\narchitectures to achieve properties thought to be desirable, such as\northogonality and sparsity. In contrast, the idea behind deep reinforcement\nlearning methods is that the agent designer should not encode representational\nproperties, but rather that the data stream should determine the properties of\nthe representation -- good representations emerge under appropriate training\nschemes. In this paper we bring these two perspectives together, empirically\ninvestigating the properties of representations that support transfer in\nreinforcement learning. This analysis allows us to provide novel hypotheses\nregarding impact of auxiliary tasks in end-to-end training of non-linear\nreinforcement learning methods. We introduce and measure six representational\nproperties over more than 25 thousand agent-task settings. We consider DQN\nagents with convolutional networks in a pixel-based navigation environment.

Previous works have\nconsidered cross-device FL for automatic speech recognition (ASR), however,\nthere are a few important challenges that have not been fully addressed. These\ninclude the lack of ground-truth ASR transcriptions, and the scarcity of\ncompute resource and network bandwidth on edge devices. In this paper, we\naddress these two challenges. First, we propose a federated learning system to\nsupport on-device ASR adaptation with full self-supervision, which uses\nself-labeling together with data augmentation and filtering techniques. The\nproposed system can improve a strong Emformer-Transducer based ASR model\npretrained on out-of-domain data, using in-domain audios without any\nground-truth transcriptions. Second, to reduce the training cost, we propose a\nself-restricted RNN Transducer (SR-RNN-T) loss, a new variant of\nalignment-restricted RNN-T that uses Viterbi forced-alignment from\nself-supervision. To further reduce the compute and network cost, we\nsystematically explore adapting only a subset of weights in the\nEmformer-Transducer.

    "abstract": "Motion planning methods for autonomous systems based on nonlinear programming\noffer great flexibility in incorporating various dynamics, objectives, and\nconstraints. One limitation of such tools is the difficulty of efficiently\nrepresenting obstacle avoidance conditions for non-trivial shapes. For example,\nit is possible to define collision avoidance constraints suitable for nonlinear\nprogramming solvers in the canonical setting of a circular robot navigating\naround M convex polytopes over N time steps. However, it requires introducing\n(2+L)MN additional constraints and LMN additional variables, with L being the\nnumber of halfplanes per polytope, leading to larger nonlinear programs with\nslower and less reliable solving time. In this paper, we overcome this issue by\nbuilding closed-form representations of the collision avoidance conditions by\nouter-approximating the Minkowski sum conditions for collision. Our solution\nrequires only MN constraints (and no additional variables), leading to a\nsmaller nonlinear program. On motion planning problems for an autonomous car\nand quadcopter in cluttered environments, we achieve speedups of 4.8x and 8.7x\nrespectively with significantly less variance in solve times and negligible\nimpact on performance arising from the use of outer approximations.",

    "abstract": "The further development of deep neural networks is hampered by the limited\nGPU memory resource. Therefore, the optimization of GPU memory resources is\nhighly demanded. Swapping and recomputation are commonly applied to make better\nuse of GPU memory in deep learning. However, as an emerging domain, several\nchallenges remain:1)The efficiency of recomputation is limited for both static\nand dynamic methods. 2)Swapping requires offloading parameters manually, which\nincurs a great time cost. 3) There is no such dynamic and fine-grained method\nthat involves tensor swapping together with tensor recomputation nowadays. To\nremedy the above issues, we propose a novel scheduler manager named\nDELTA(Dynamic tEnsor offLoad and recompuTAtion). To the best of our knowledge,\nwe are the first to make a reasonable dynamic runtime scheduler on the\ncombination of tensor swapping and tensor recomputation without user oversight.\nIn DELTA, we propose a filter algorithm to select the optimal tensors to be\nreleased out of GPU memory and present a director algorithm to select a proper\naction for each of these tensors. Furthermore, prefetching and overlapping are\ndeliberately considered to overcome the time cost caused by swapping and\nrecomputing tensors. Experimental results show that DELTA not only saves\n40%-70% of GPU memory, surpassing the state-of-the-art method to a great extent\nbut also gets comparable convergence results as the baseline with acceptable\ntime delay. Also, DELTA gains 2.04$\\times$ maximum batchsize when training\nResNet-50 and 2.25$\\times$ when training ResNet-101 compared with the baseline.\nBesides, comparisons between the swapping cost and recomputation cost in our\nexperiments demonstrate the importance of making a reasonable dynamic scheduler\non tensor swapping and tensor recomputation, which refutes the arguments in\nsome related work that swapping should be the first and best choice.",

As the size of machine\nlearning networks and workloads continues to increase, multi-GPU machines have\nemerged as an important platform offered on High Performance Computing and\ncloud data centers. As these machines are shared between multiple users, it\nbecomes increasingly important to protect applications against potential\nattacks. In this paper, we explore the vulnerability of Nvidia's DGX multi-GPU\nmachines to covert and side channel attacks. These machines consist of a number\nof discrete GPUs that are interconnected through a combination of custom\ninterconnect (NVLink) and PCIe connections. We reverse engineer the cache\nhierarchy and show that it is possible for an attacker on one GPU to cause\ncontention on the L2 cache of another GPU. We use this observation to first\ndevelop a covert channel attack across two GPUs, achieving the best bandwidth\nof 3.95 MB/s. We also develop a prime and probe attack on a remote GPU allowing\nan attacker to recover the cache hit and miss behavior of another workload.\nThis basic capability can be used in any number of side channel attacks: we\ndemonstrate a proof of concept attack that fingerprints the application running\non the remote GPU, with high accuracy.

    "abstract": "Learning and predicting the performance of a configurable software system\nhelps to provide better quality assurance.

Despite the\npresence of different encoding schemes, there is still little understanding of\nwhich is better and under what circumstances, as the community often relies on\nsome general beliefs that inform the decision in an ad-hoc manner. To bridge\nthis gap, in this paper, we empirically compared the widely used encoding\nschemes for software performance learning, namely label, scaled label, and\none-hot encoding. The study covers five systems, seven models, and three\nencoding schemes, leading to 105 cases of investigation.\nOur key findings reveal that: (1) conducting trial-and-error to find the best\nencoding scheme in a case by case manner can be rather expensive, requiring up\nto 400+ hours on some models and systems; (2) the one-hot encoding often leads\nto the most accurate results while the scaled label encoding is generally weak\non accuracy over different models; (3) conversely, the scaled label encoding\ntends to result in the fastest training time across the models/systems while\nthe one-hot encoding is the slowest; (4) for all models studied, label and\nscaled label encoding often lead to relatively less biased outcomes between\naccuracy and training time, but the paired model varies according to the\nsystem.\nWe discuss the actionable suggestions derived from our findings, hoping to\nprovide a better understanding of this topic for the community.

A\nmathematical description of the optimal performance possible (the smallest\npossible error of recovery) is known in the presence of a model class\nassumption. Under standard model class assumptions, it is shown in this paper\nthat a near optimal $\\hat f$ can be found by solving a certain discrete\nover-parameterized optimization problem with a penalty term.

Current black-box\nattacks need a large number of queries to succeed, resulting in high\ncomputational overhead in the process of attack. On the other hand, attacks\nwith restricted perturbations are ineffective against defenses such as\ndenoising or adversarial training. In this paper, we focus on unrestricted\nperturbations and propose StyleFool, a black-box video adversarial attack via\nstyle transfer to fool the video classification system. StyleFool first\nutilizes color theme proximity to select the best style image, which helps\navoid unnatural details in the stylized videos. Meanwhile, the target class\nconfidence is additionally considered in targeted attack to influence the\noutput distribution of the classifier by moving the stylized video closer to or\neven across the decision boundary. A gradient-free method is then employed to\nfurther optimize the adversarial perturbation. We carry out extensive\nexperiments to evaluate StyleFool on two standard datasets, UCF-101 and\nHMDB-51. The experimental results suggest that StyleFool outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art adversarial attacks in terms of both number of queries and\nrobustness against existing defenses. We identify that 50% of the stylized\nvideos in untargeted attack do not need any query since they can already fool\nthe video classification model.

    "title": "Meta-Sampler: Almost-Universal yet Task-Oriented Sampling for Point  Clouds",
    "abstract": "Sampling is a key operation in point-cloud task and acts to increase\ncomputational efficiency and tractability by discarding redundant points.\nUniversal sampling algorithms (e.g., Farthest Point Sampling) work without\nmodification across different tasks, models, and datasets, but by their very\nnature are agnostic about the downstream task/model. As such, they have no\nimplicit knowledge about which points would be best to keep and which to\nreject. Recent work has shown how task-specific point cloud sampling (e.g.,\nSampleNet) can be used to outperform traditional sampling approaches by\nlearning which points are more informative. However, these learnable samplers\nface two inherent issues: i) overfitting to a model rather than a task, and\n\\ii) requiring training of the sampling network from scratch, in addition to\nthe task network, somewhat countering the original objective of down-sampling\nto increase efficiency. In this work, we propose an almost-universal sampler,\nin our quest for a sampler that can learn to preserve the most useful points\nfor a particular task, yet be inexpensive to adapt to different tasks, models,\nor datasets. We first demonstrate how training over multiple models for the\nsame task (e.g., shape reconstruction) significantly outperforms the vanilla\nSampleNet in terms of accuracy by not overfitting the sample network to a\nparticular task network. Second, we show how we can train an almost-universal\nmeta-sampler across multiple tasks. This meta-sampler can then be rapidly\nfine-tuned when applied to different datasets, networks, or even different\ntasks, thus amortizing the initial cost of training.",

    "abstract": "Photonic accelerators have been intensively studied to provide enhanced\ninformation processing capability to benefit from the unique attributes of\nphysical processes. Recently, it has been reported that chaotically oscillating\nultrafast time series from a laser, called laser chaos, provides the ability to\nsolve multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems or decision-making problems at GHz\norder. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that the negatively correlated\ntime-domain structure of laser chaos contributes to the acceleration of\ndecision-making. However, the underlying mechanism of why decision-making is\naccelerated by correlated time series is unknown. In this paper, we demonstrate\na theoretical model to account for the acceleration of decision-making by\ncorrelated time sequence. We first confirm the effectiveness of the negative\nautocorrelation inherent in time series for solving two-armed bandit problems\nusing Fourier transform surrogate methods. We propose a theoretical model that\nconcerns the correlated time series subjected to the decision-making system and\nthe internal status of the system therein in a unified manner, inspired by\ncorrelated random walks. We demonstrate that the performance derived\nanalytically by the theory agrees well with the numerical simulations, which\nconfirms the validity of the proposed model and leads to optimal system design.\nThe present study paves the new way for the effectiveness of correlated time\nseries for decision-making, impacting artificial intelligence and other\napplications.",

To make\nthe CSI feedback overhead affordable for the evolution of MIMO technology\n(e.g., massive MIMO and ultra-massive MIMO), deep learning (DL) is introduced\nto deal with the CSI compression task. Based on the separation principle in\nexisting communication systems, DL based CSI compression is used as source\ncoding.

In this paper, we propose a deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC)\nbased framework for the CSI feedback task. In particular, the proposed method\ncan simultaneously learn from the CSI source and the wireless channel. Instead\nof truncating CSI via Fourier transform in the delay domain in existing\nmethods, we apply non-linear transform networks to compress the CSI.\nFurthermore, we adopt an SNR adaption mechanism to deal with the wireless\nchannel variations.

    "abstract": "Large rotating machines, e.g., compressors, steam turbines, gas turbines, are\ncritical equipment in many process industries such as energy, chemical, and\npower generation. Due to high rotating speed and tremendous momentum of the\nrotor, the centrifugal force may lead to flying apart of the rotor parts, which\nbrings a great threat to the operation safety. Early detection and prediction\nof potential failures could prevent the catastrophic plant downtime and\neconomic loss. In this paper, we divide the operational states of a rotating\nmachine into normal, risky, and high-risk ones based on the time to the moment\nof failure. Then a cascade classifying algorithm is proposed to predict the\nstates in two steps, first we judge whether the machine is in normal or\nabnormal condition; for time periods which are predicted as abnormal we further\nclassify them into risky or high-risk states. Moreover, traditional\nclassification model evaluation metrics, such as confusion matrix, true-false\naccuracy, are static and neglect the online prediction dynamics and uneven\nwrong-prediction prices. An Online Prediction Ability Index (OPAI) is proposed\nto select prediction models with consistent online predictions and smaller\nclose-to-downtime prediction errors.

Despite\nits promise, which has been demonstrated in both academic researches and\nindustrial tools, its effectiveness largely hinges on the availability of a\nlarge amount of high-quality training data.

    "abstract": "Variational auto-encoder(VAE) is an effective neural network architecture to\ndisentangle a speech utterance into speaker identity and linguistic content\nlatent embeddings, then generate an utterance for a target speaker from that of\na source speaker. This is possible by concatenating the identity embedding of\nthe target speaker and the content embedding of the source speaker uttering a\ndesired sentence. In this work, we found a suitable location of VAE's decoder\nto add a self-attention layer for incorporating non-local information in\ngenerating a converted utterance and hiding the source speaker's identity. In\nexperiments of zero-shot many-to-many voice conversion task on VCTK data set,\nthe self-attention layer enhances speaker classification accuracy on unseen\nspeakers by 27\\% while increasing the decoder parameter size by 12\\%. The voice\nquality of converted utterance degrades by merely 3\\% measured by the MOSNet\nscores. To reduce over-fitting and generalization error, we further applied a\nrelaxed group-wise splitting method in network training and achieved a gain of\nspeaker classification accuracy on unseen speakers by 46\\% while maintaining\nthe conversion voice quality in terms of MOSNet scores.

How to generate pseudo labels for\nunseen-class samples and how to use such usually noisy pseudo labels are two\ncritical issues in transductive learning. In this work, we introduce an\niterative co-training framework which contains two different base ZSL models\nand an exchanging module.

By such, our framework can gradually boost the ZSL performance by\nfully exploiting the potential complementarity of the two models'\nclassification capabilities. In addition, our co-training framework is also\napplied to the generalized ZSL (GZSL), in which a semantic-guided OOD detector\nis proposed to pick out the most likely unseen-class samples before class-level\nclassification to alleviate the bias problem in GZSL.

However, the time and space complexity grows\nexponentially with the number of qubits and easily exceeds the capability of a\nsingle machine.\nTherefore, we develop a distributed state vector simulator, $mpiQulacs$, that\nis optimized for large-scale simulation on A64FX-based cluster systems.

We evaluate weak and strong scaling of mpiQulacs with up to 36\nqubits on a new 64-node A64FX-based cluster system named $Todoroki$. By\ncomparing mpiQulacs with existing distributed state vector simulators, we show\nthat mpiQulacs achieves the highest performance for large-scale simulation on\ntens of nodes while sustaining a nearly ideal scalability.

    "abstract": "Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has recently gained much\nattention for its promise to train segmentation models only with image-level\nlabels. Existing WSSS methods commonly argue that the sparse coverage of CAM\nincurs the performance bottleneck of WSSS. This paper provides analytical and\nempirical evidence that the actual bottleneck may not be sparse coverage but a\nglobal thresholding scheme applied after CAM. Then, we show that this issue can\nbe mitigated by satisfying two conditions; 1) reducing the imbalance in the\nforeground activation and 2) increasing the gap between the foreground and the\nbackground activation. Based on these findings, we propose a novel activation\nmanipulation network with a per-pixel classification loss and a label\nconditioning module. Per-pixel classification naturally induces two-level\nactivation in activation maps, which can penalize the most discriminative\nparts, promote the less discriminative parts, and deactivate the background\nregions. Label conditioning imposes that the output label of pseudo-masks\nshould be any of true image-level labels; it penalizes the wrong activation\nassigned to non-target classes. Based on extensive analysis and evaluations, we\ndemonstrate that each component helps produce accurate pseudo-masks, achieving\nthe robustness against the choice of the global threshold. Finally, our model\nachieves state-of-the-art records on both PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014\ndatasets.",

Our method is based\non the observation that a good initial guess of the future poses is very\nhelpful in improving the forecasting accuracy. This motivates us to propose a\nnovel two-stage prediction framework, including an init-prediction network that\njust computes the good guess and then a formal-prediction network that predicts\nthe target future poses based on the guess. More importantly, we extend this\nidea further and design a multi-stage prediction framework where each stage\npredicts initial guess for the next stage, which brings more performance gain.\nTo fulfill the prediction task at each stage, we propose a network comprising\nSpatial Dense Graph Convolutional Networks (S-DGCN) and Temporal Dense Graph\nConvolutional Networks (T-DGCN). Alternatively executing the two networks helps\nextract spatiotemporal features over the global receptive field of the whole\npose sequence. All the above design choices cooperating together make our\nmethod outperform previous approaches by large margins: 6%-7% on Human3.6M,\n5%-10% on CMU-MoCap, and 13%-16% on 3DPW.",

To\nreduce the leading coefficient, Cenk and Hasan give a general approach reducing\nthe leading coefficient of $<2,2,2;7>$-algorithm to $5$ but increasing IO\ncomplexity. In 2017, Karstadt and Schwartz also reduce the leading coefficient\nof $<2,2,2;7>$-algorithm to $5$ by the Alternative Basis Matrix Multiplication\nmethod. Meanwhile, their method reduces the IO complexity and low-order\nmonomials in arithmetic complexity. In 2019, Beniamini and Schwartz generalize\nAlternative Basis Matrix Multiplication method reducing leading coefficient in\narithmetic complexity but increasing IO complexity. In this paper, we propose a\nnew matrix multiplication algorithm which reduces leading coefficient both in\narithmetic complexity and IO complexity. We apply our method to Strassen-like\nalgorithms improving arithmetic complexity and IO complexity (the comparison\nwith previous results are shown in Tables 1 and 2).

By contrast, a more realistic and challenging task is to separate a\nmixture in which the number of speakers is unknown. This paper formulates the\nspeech separation with the unknown number of speakers as a multi-pass source\nextraction problem and proposes a coarse-to-fine recursive speech separation\nmethod. This method comprises two stages, namely, recursive cue extraction and\ntarget speaker extraction. The recursive cue extraction stage determines how\nmany computational iterations need to be performed and outputs a coarse cue\nspeech by monitoring statistics in the mixture. As the number of recursive\niterations increases, the accumulation of distortion eventually comes into the\nextracted speech and reminder. Therefore, in the second stage, we use a target\nspeaker extraction network to extract a fine speech based on the coarse target\ncue and the original distortionless mixture. Experiments show that the proposed\nmethod archived state-of-the-art performance on the WSJ0 dataset with a\ndifferent number of speakers.

While it is well understood that cryptocurrencies are centralized, it\nis still unclear what the underlying causes are. This work aims to address this\ngap and examines some of the forces behind mining centralization.\nThe internals of cryptocurrency mining is very opaque and difficult to study\nsince it traditionally requires forming relationships with miners, who are\ntypically reticent to share internal information about their competitive\nadvantages. This work takes a different approach by combining large-scale\nstatistical techniques with publicly available blockchain data in order to\nanswer previously intractable questions.

    "title": "Pay Attention to Hidden States for Video Deblurring: Ping-Pong Recurrent  Neural Networks and Selective Non-Local Attention",
    "abstract": "Video deblurring models exploit information in the neighboring frames to\nremove blur caused by the motion of the camera and the objects. Recurrent\nNeural Networks~(RNNs) are often adopted to model the temporal dependency\nbetween frames via hidden states. When motion blur is strong, however, hidden\nstates are hard to deliver proper information due to the displacement between\ndifferent frames. While there have been attempts to update the hidden states,\nit is difficult to handle misaligned features beyond the receptive field of\nsimple modules. Thus, we propose 2 modules to supplement the RNN architecture\nfor video deblurring. First, we design Ping-Pong RNN~(PPRNN) that acts on\nupdating the hidden states by referring to the features from the current and\nthe previous time steps alternately. PPRNN gathers relevant information from\nthe both features in an iterative and balanced manner by utilizing its\nrecurrent architecture. Second, we use a Selective Non-Local Attention~(SNLA)\nmodule to additionally refine the hidden state by aligning it with the\npositional information from the input frame feature. The attention score is\nscaled by the relevance to the input feature to focus on the necessary\ninformation. By paying attention to hidden states with both modules, which have\nstrong synergy, our PAHS framework improves the representation powers of RNN\nstructures and achieves state-of-the-art deblurring performance on standard\nbenchmarks and real-world videos.",

    "title": "Learning (Local) Surrogate Loss Functions for Predict-Then-Optimize  Problems",
    "abstract": "Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) is a paradigm for tailoring a predictive\nmodel to a downstream optimisation task that uses its predictions, so that it\ncan perform better on that specific task. The main technical challenge\nassociated with DFL is that it requires being able to differentiate through\n$argmin$ operations to work. However, these $argmin$ optimisations are often\npiecewise constant and, as a result, naively differentiating through them would\nprovide uninformative gradients. Past work has largely focused on getting\naround this issue by handcrafting task-specific surrogates to the original\noptimisation problem that provide informative gradients when differentiated\nthrough. However, finding these surrogates can be challenging and the need to\nhandcraft surrogates for each new task limits the usability of DFL. In\naddition, even after applying these relaxation techniques, there are no\nguarantees that the resulting surrogates are convex and, as a result, training\na predictive model on them may lead to said model getting stuck in local\nminimas.\nIn this paper, we provide an approach to learn faithful task-specific\nsurrogates which (a) only requires access to a black-box oracle that can solve\nthe optimisation problem and is thus generalizable, and (b) can be convex by\nconstruction and so can be easily optimized over. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work on using learning to find good surrogates for DFL. We\nevaluate our approach on a budget allocation problem from the literature and\nfind that our approach outperforms even the hand-crafted (non-convex) surrogate\nloss proposed by the original paper. Taking a step back, we hope that the\ngenerality and simplicity of our approach will help lower the barrier\nassociated with implementing DFL-based solutions in practice. To that end, we\nare currently working on extending our experiments to more domains.",

To validate our\nidea, we crowdsource programs for cooking recipes and show that: (a) projecting\nthe image-recipe embeddings into programs leads to better cross-modal retrieval\nresults; (b) generating programs from images leads to better recognition\nresults compared to predicting raw cooking instructions; and (c) we can\ngenerate food images by manipulating programs via optimizing the latent code of\na GAN.

In this paper, we define explainability by\nthe interpretability of the explanations (through the widely-used XAI\nproperties parsimony and functional complexity) and the faithfulness of the\nexplainability model (through monotonicity and level of disagreement). The\nintroduced properties are analysed along the event, case, and control flow\nperspective that are typical of a process-based analysis.

Compared with\nlow-resolution videos, high-resolution videos contain richer appearance\n(spatial) information and more complex motion (temporal) information. In this\npaper, we propose a Spatiotemporal Residual Predictive Model (STRPM) for\nhigh-resolution video prediction. On the one hand, we propose a Spatiotemporal\nEncoding-Decoding Scheme to preserve more spatiotemporal information for\nhigh-resolution videos. In this way, the appearance details for each frame can\nbe greatly preserved. On the other hand, we design a Residual Predictive Memory\n(RPM) which focuses on modeling the spatiotemporal residual features (STRF)\nbetween previous and future frames instead of the whole frame, which can\ngreatly help capture the complex motion information in high-resolution videos.\nIn addition, the proposed RPM can supervise the spatial encoder and temporal\nencoder to extract different features in the spatial domain and the temporal\ndomain, respectively. Moreover, the proposed model is trained using generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) with a learned perceptual loss (LP-loss) to improve\nthe perceptual quality of the predictions.

    "abstract": "The crux of long-term tracking lies in the difficulty of tracking the target\nwith discontinuous moving caused by out-of-view or occlusion. Existing\nlong-term tracking methods follow two typical strategies. The first strategy\nemploys a local tracker to perform smooth tracking and uses another re-detector\nto detect the target when the target is lost. While it can exploit the temporal\ncontext like historical appearances and locations of the target, a potential\nlimitation of such strategy is that the local tracker tends to misidentify a\nnearby distractor as the target instead of activating the re-detector when the\nreal target is out of view. The other long-term tracking strategy tracks the\ntarget in the entire image globally instead of local tracking based on the\nprevious tracking results. Unfortunately, such global tracking strategy cannot\nleverage the temporal context effectively. In this work, we combine the\nadvantages of both strategies: tracking the target in a global view while\nexploiting the temporal context. Specifically, we perform global tracking via\nensemble of local trackers spreading the full image. The smooth moving of the\ntarget can be handled steadily by one local tracker. When the local tracker\naccidentally loses the target due to suddenly discontinuous moving, another\nlocal tracker close to the target is then activated and can readily take over\nthe tracking to locate the target. While the activated local tracker performs\ntracking locally by leveraging the temporal context, the ensemble of local\ntrackers renders our model the global view for tracking. Extensive experiments\non six datasets demonstrate that our method performs favorably against\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.",

Specifically, an active IRS is deployed to\nassist a multi-antenna access point (AP) to convey information and energy\nsimultaneously to multiple single-antenna information users (IUs) and energy\nusers (EUs). Two joint transmit and reflect beamforming optimization problems\nare investigated with different practical objectives.

To tackle these two\nproblems, we first rigorously prove that dedicated energy beams are not\nrequired for their corresponding semidefinite relaxation (SDR) reformulations\nand the SDR is tight for the first problem, thus greatly simplifying the AP\nprecoding design. Then, by capitalizing on the techniques of alternating\noptimization (AO), SDR, and successive convex approximation (SCA),\ncomputationally efficient algorithms are developed to obtain suboptimal\nsolutions of the resulting optimization problems.

However, currently researches on GCN models\nusually recursively aggregate the information from all the neighbors or\nrandomly sampled neighbor subsets, without explicitly identifying whether the\naggregated neighbors provide useful information during the graph convolution.\nIn this paper, we theoretically analyze the affection of the neighbor quality\nover GCN models' performance and propose the Neighbor Enhanced Graph\nConvolutional Network (NEGCN) framework to boost the performance of existing\nGCN models. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we at the first time propose\nthe concept of neighbor quality for both node classification and recommendation\ntasks in a general theoretical framework. Specifically, for node\nclassification, we propose three propositions to theoretically analyze how the\nneighbor quality affects the node classification performance of GCN models.\nSecond, based on the three proposed propositions, we introduce the graph\nrefinement process including specially designed neighbor evaluation methods to\nincrease the neighbor quality so as to boost both the node classification and\nrecommendation tasks. Third, we conduct extensive node classification and\nrecommendation experiments on several benchmark datasets. The experimental\nresults verify that our proposed NEGCN framework can significantly enhance the\nperformance for various typical GCN models on both node classification and\nrecommendation tasks.",

However, the\nnon-i.i.d and non-stationary nature of continual learning data, especially in\nthe online setting, amplify the discrepancy between training and testing in BN\nand hinder the performance of older tasks. In this work, we study the\ncross-task normalization effect of BN in online continual learning where BN\nnormalizes the testing data using moments biased towards the current task,\nresulting in higher catastrophic forgetting. This limitation motivates us to\npropose a simple yet effective method that we call Continual Normalization (CN)\nto facilitate training similar to BN while mitigating its negative effect.\nExtensive experiments on different continual learning algorithms and online\nscenarios show that CN is a direct replacement for BN and can provide\nsubstantial performance improvements.

    "abstract": "In step with the digitalization of transportation, we are witnessing a\ngrowing range of path-based smart-city applications, e.g., travel-time\nestimation and travel path ranking. A temporal path~(TP) that includes temporal\ninformation, e.g., departure time, into the path is of fundamental to enable\nsuch applications. In this setting, it is essential to learn generic temporal\npath representations~(TPRs) that consider spatial and temporal correlations\nsimultaneously and that can be used in different applications, i.e., downstream\ntasks. Existing methods fail to achieve the goal since (i) supervised methods\nrequire large amounts of task-specific labels when training and thus fail to\ngeneralize the obtained TPRs to other tasks; (ii) though unsupervised methods\ncan learn generic representations, they disregard the temporal aspect, leading\nto sub-optimal results. To contend with the limitations of existing solutions,\nwe propose a Weakly-Supervised Contrastive (WSC) learning model. We first\npropose a temporal path encoder that encodes both the spatial and temporal\ninformation of a temporal path into a TPR. To train the encoder, we introduce\nweak labels that are easy and inexpensive to obtain, and are relevant to\ndifferent tasks, e.g., temporal labels indicating peak vs. off-peak hour from\ndeparture times. Based on the weak labels, we construct meaningful positive and\nnegative temporal path samples by considering both spatial and temporal\ninformation, which facilities training the encoder using contrastive learning\nby pulling closer the positive samples' representations while pushing away the\nnegative samples' representations. To better guide the contrastive learning, we\npropose a learning strategy based on Curriculum Learning such that the learning\nperforms from easy to hard training instances. Experiments studies verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.",

To ease this problem, this paper targets on cutting down the\nexecution time of deep-learning-based compressors. Building\nhistory-dependencies sequentially (e.g., recurrent neural networks) is\nresponsible for long inference latency. Instead, we introduce transformer into\ndeep learning compressors to build history-dependencies in parallel. However,\nexisting transformer is too heavy in computation and incompatible to\ncompression tasks.\nThis paper proposes a fast general-purpose lossless compressor, TRACE, by\ndesigning a compression-friendly structure based on a single-layer transformer.\nWe first design a new metric to advise the selection part of compression model\nstructures. Byte-grouping and Shared-ffn schemes are further proposed to fully\nutilize the capacity of the single-layer transformer. These features allow\nTRACE to achieve competitive compression ratio and a much faster speed. In\naddition, we further accelerate the compression procedure by designing a\ncontroller to reduce the parameter updating overhead. Experiments show that\nTRACE achieves an overall $\\sim$3x speedup while keeps a comparable compression\nratio to the state-of-the-art compressors.

Due to the high level of dynamic\ncomplexity, modern neuron models have seldom been implemented in SNN practice.\nIn this study, we adopt the Phase Plane Analysis (PPA) technique, a technique\noften utilized in neurodynamics field, to integrate a recent neuron model,\nnamely, the Izhikevich neuron. Based on the findings in the advancement of\nneuroscience, the Izhikevich neuron model can be biologically plausible while\nmaintaining comparable computational cost with LIF neurons. By utilizing the\nadopted PPA, we have accomplished putting neurons built with the modified\nIzhikevich model into SNN practice, dubbed as the Standardized Izhikevich Tonic\n(SIT) neuron. For performance, we evaluate the suggested technique for image\nclassification tasks in self-built LIF-and-SIT-consisted SNNs, named Hybrid\nNeural Network (HNN) on static MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 datasets and\nneuromorphic N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128 Gesture datasets.

However, as a simplification of real-world problems,\nthe first-order random walk is poor at modeling higher-order structures in the\ndata. Recently, second-order random walk-based applications (e.g., Node2vec,\nSecond-order PageRank) have become attractive. Due to the complexity of the\nsecond-order random walk models and memory limitations, it is not scalable to\nrun second-order random walk-based applications on a single machine. Existing\ndisk-based graph systems are only friendly to the first-order random walk\nmodels and suffer from expensive disk I/Os when executing the second-order\nrandom walks. This paper introduces an I/O-efficient disk-based graph system\nfor the scalable second-order random walk of large graphs, called GraSorw.\nFirst, to eliminate massive light vertex I/Os, we develop a bi-block execution\nengine that converts random I/Os into sequential I/Os by applying a new\ntriangular bi-block scheduling strategy, the bucket-based walk management, and\nthe skewed walk storage. Second, to improve the I/O utilization, we design a\nlearning-based block loading model to leverage the advantages of the full-load\nand on-demand load methods. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on six\nlarge real datasets as well as several synthetic datasets.

The objective\nof the control is to optimally split the energy between the sources of the\npowertrain and achieve fuel consumption minimization. In contrast to existing\nworks, a fuel penalty is used to characterize more realistically SSS engine\nrestarts, to enable more realistic design and testing of control algorithms.\nThe paper first derives two important analytic results: a) analytic EM optimal\nsolutions of fundamental and commonly used series HEV frameworks, and b) proof\nof optimality of charge sustaining operation in series HEVs.

The decision parameters of the\ncontrol strategy are small in number and freely tunable. The overall control\nperformance can be fully optimized for different HEV parameters and driving\ncycles by a systematic tuning process, while also targeting charge sustaining\noperation. The performance of HPTS is evaluated and benchmarked against\nexisting methodologies, including dynamic programming (DP) and a recently\nproposed state-of-the-art heuristic strategy.

    "title": "Example-based Explanations with Adversarial Attacks for Respiratory  Sound Analysis",
    "abstract": "Respiratory sound classification is an important tool for remote screening of\nrespiratory-related diseases such as pneumonia, asthma, and COVID-19. To\nfacilitate the interpretability of classification results, especially ones\nbased on deep learning, many explanation methods have been proposed using\nprototypes. However, existing explanation techniques often assume that the data\nis non-biased and the prediction results can be explained by a set of\nprototypical examples. In this work, we develop a unified example-based\nexplanation method for selecting both representative data (prototypes) and\noutliers (criticisms). In particular, we propose a novel application of\nadversarial attacks to generate an explanation spectrum of data instances via\nan iterative fast gradient sign method. Such unified explanation can avoid\nover-generalisation and bias by allowing human experts to assess the model\nmistakes case by case. We performed a wide range of quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations to show that our approach generates effective and\nunderstandable explanation and is robust with many deep learning models",

    "abstract": "An important aspect of many particle accelerators is the constant evolution\nand frequent configuration changes that are needed to perform the experiments\nthey are designed for. This often leads to the design of configurable software\nthat can absorb these changes and perform the required control and protection\nactions. This design strategy minimizes the engineering and maintenance costs,\nbut it makes the software verification activities more challenging since safety\nproperties must be guaranteed for any of the possible configurations. Software\nmodel checking is a popular automated verification technique in many\nindustries. This verification method explores all possible combinations of the\nsystem model to guarantee its compliance with certain properties or\nspecification. This is a very appropriate technique for highly configurable\nsoftware, since there is usually an enormous amount of combinations to be\nchecked. This paper presents how PLCverif, a CERN model checking platform, has\nbeen applied to a highly configurable Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)\nprogram, the SPS Personnel Protection System (PPS). The benefits and challenges\nof this verification approach are also discussed.",

When using\nisogeometric analysis (IGA), it is possible to use such NURBS geometries for\nnumerical analysis directly. Analyzing fluid flows, however, requires complex\nthree-dimensional geometries to represent flow domains. Defining a\nparametrization of such volumetric domains using NURBS can be challenging and\nis still an ongoing topic in the IGA community. With the recently developed\nNURBS-enhanced finite element method (NEFEM), the favorable geometric\ncharacteristics of NURBS are used within a standard finite element method. This\nis achieved by enhancing the elements touching the boundary by using the NURBS\ngeometry itself. In the current work, a new variation of NEFEM is introduced,\nwhich is suitable for three-dimensional space-time finite element formulations.\nThe proposed method makes use of a new mapping which results in a non-Cartesian\nformulation suitable for fluid-structure interaction (FSI). This is\ndemonstrated by combining the method with an IGA formulation in a\nstrongly-coupled partitioned framework for solving FSI problems. The framework\nyields a fully spline-based representation of the fluid-structure interface\nthrough a single NURBS. The coupling conditions at the fluid-structure\ninterface are enforced through a Robin-Neumann type coupling scheme. This\nscheme is particularly useful when considering incompressible fluids in fully\nDirichlet-bounded and curved problems, as it satisfies the incompressibility\nconstraint on the fluid for each step within the coupling procedure. The\naccuracy and performance of the introduced spline-based space-time finite\nelement approach and its use within the proposed coupled FSI framework are\ndemonstrated using a series of two- and three-dimensional benchmark problems.",

    "abstract": "More and more learning apps like Duolingo are using some form of gamification\n(e.g., badges, points, and leaderboards) to enhance user learning. However,\nthey are not always successful. Gamification misuse is a phenomenon that occurs\nwhen users become too fixated on gamification and get distracted from learning.\nThis undesirable phenomenon wastes users' precious time and negatively impacts\ntheir learning performance. However, there has been little research in the\nliterature to understand gamification misuse and inform future gamification\ndesigns. Therefore, this paper aims to fill this knowledge gap by conducting\nthe first extensive qualitative research on gamification misuse in a popular\nlearning app called Duolingo. Duolingo is currently the world's most downloaded\nlearning app used to learn languages. This study consists of two phases: (I) a\ncontent analysis of data from Duolingo forums (from the past nine years) and\n(II) semi-structured interviews with 15 international Duolingo users. Our\nresearch contributes to the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Learning at\nScale (L@S) research communities in three ways: (1) elaborating the\nramifications of gamification misuse on user learning, well-being, and ethics,\n(2) identifying the most common reasons for gamification misuse (e.g.,\ncompetitiveness, overindulgence in playfulness, and herding), and (3) providing\ndesigners with practical suggestions to prevent (or mitigate) the occurrence of\ngamification misuse in their future designs of gamified learning apps.",

Importantly, we parameterize both\nmechanisms, giving placement officers precise control how to trade off family\nwelfare against overall employment success. Preliminary simulations on\nsynthetic data show that both mechanisms can significantly increase family\nwelfare even with only a small loss on the overall employment rate of refugees.",

    "abstract": "Mobile robot autonomy has made significant advances in recent years, with\nnavigation algorithms well developed and used commercially in certain\nwell-defined environments, such as warehouses. The common link in usage\nscenarios is that the environments in which the robots are utilized have a high\ndegree of certainty. Operating environments are often designed to be robot\nfriendly, for example augmented reality markers are strategically placed and\nthe ground is typically smooth, level, and clear of debris. For robots to be\nuseful in a wider range of environments, especially environments that are not\nsanitized for their use, robots must be able to handle uncertainty. This\nrequires a robot to incorporate new sensors and sources of information, and to\nbe able to use this information to make decisions regarding navigation and the\noverall mission. When using autonomous mobile robots in unstructured and poorly\ndefined environments, such as a natural disaster site or in a rural\nenvironment, ground condition is of critical importance and is a common cause\nof failure. Examples include loss of traction due to high levels of ground\nwater, hidden cavities, or material boundary failures. To evaluate a\nnon-contact sensing method to mitigate these risks, Frequency Modulated\nContinuous Wave (FMCW) radar is integrated with an Unmanned Ground Vehicle\n(UGV), representing a novel application of FMCW to detect new measurands for\nRobotic Autonomous Systems (RAS) navigation, informing on terrain integrity and\nadding to the state-of-the-art in sensing for optimized autonomous path\nplanning. In this paper, the FMCW is first evaluated in a desktop setting to\ndetermine its performance in anticipated ground conditions. The FMCW is then\nfixed to a UGV and the sensor system is tested and validated in a\nrepresentative environment containing regions with significant levels of ground\nwater saturation.",

Effective and\ntransparent machine learning on data streams is thus often challenging.\nHoeffding Trees have emerged as a state-of-the art for online predictive\nmodelling. They are easy to train and provide meaningful convergence guarantees\nunder a stationary process. Yet, at the same time, Hoeffding Trees often\nrequire heuristic and costly extensions to adjust to distributional change,\nwhich may considerably impair their interpretability. In this work, we revisit\nModel Trees for machine learning in evolving data streams. Model Trees are able\nto maintain more flexible and locally robust representations of the active data\nconcept, making them a natural fit for data stream applications. Our novel\nframework, called Dynamic Model Tree, satisfies desirable consistency and\nminimality properties. In experiments with synthetic and real-world tabular\nstreaming data sets, we show that the proposed framework can drastically reduce\nthe number of splits required by existing incremental decision trees. At the\nsame time, our framework often outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of\npredictive quality -- especially when concept drift is involved.

Although monocular full\nhuman motion capture technologies have made great progress in recent years,\nrecovering accurate and plausible arm twists and hand gestures from in-the-wild\nvideos still remains a challenge. To solve this problem, our solution is\nproposed based on the fact that arm poses and hand gestures are highly\ncorrelated in most real situations. To fully exploit arm-hand correlation as\nwell as inter-frame information, we carefully design a Spatial-Temporal\nParallel Arm-Hand Motion Transformer (PAHMT) to predict the arm and hand\ndynamics simultaneously. We also introduce new losses to encourage the\nestimations to be smooth and accurate. Besides, we collect a motion capture\ndataset including 200K frames of hand gestures and use this data to train our\nmodel. By integrating a 2D hand pose estimation model and a 3D human pose\nestimation model, the proposed method can produce plausible arm and hand\ndynamics from monocular video.

Recently, a series of contrastive representation learning\nmethods have achieved preeminent success. Particularly, SupCon outperformed the\ndominant methods based on cross-entropy loss in representation learning.\nHowever, we notice that there could be potential ethical risks in supervised\ncontrastive learning. In this paper, we for the first time analyze unfairness\ncaused by supervised contrastive learning and propose a new Fair Supervised\nContrastive Loss (FSCL) for fair visual representation learning. Inheriting the\nphilosophy of supervised contrastive learning, it encourages representation of\nthe same class to be closer to each other than that of different classes, while\nensuring fairness by penalizing the inclusion of sensitive attribute\ninformation in representation. In addition, we introduce a group-wise\nnormalization to diminish the disparities of intra-group compactness and\ninter-class separability between demographic groups that arouse unfair\nclassification. Through extensive experiments on CelebA and UTK Face, we\nvalidate that the proposed method significantly outperforms SupCon and existing\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of the trade-off between top-1 accuracy and\nfairness.

    "abstract": "This paper concerns the problem of multi-object tracking based on the\nmin-cost flow (MCF) formulation, which is conventionally studied as an instance\nof linear program. Given its computationally tractable inference, the success\nof MCF tracking largely relies on the learned cost function of underlying\nlinear program. Most previous studies focus on learning the cost function by\nonly taking into account two frames during training, therefore the learned cost\nfunction is sub-optimal for MCF where a multi-frame data association must be\nconsidered during inference. In order to address this problem, in this paper we\npropose a novel differentiable framework that ties training and inference\ntogether during learning by solving a bi-level optimization problem, where the\nlower-level solves a linear program and the upper-level contains a loss\nfunction that incorporates global tracking result. By back-propagating the loss\nthrough differentiable layers via gradient descent, the globally parameterized\ncost function is explicitly learned and regularized. With this approach, we are\nable to learn a better objective for global MCF tracking. As a result, we\nachieve competitive performances compared to the current state-of-the-art\nmethods on the popular multi-object tracking benchmarks such as MOT16, MOT17\nand MOT20.",

The evaluations\nconsider both an unsynchronized and a synchronized time division duplexing\n(TDD) deployment between the networks, as well as scenarios both with and\nwithout any macro eMBB traffic located inside the factory. The results show\nthat an unsynchronized deployment is possible if the isolation between the\nnetworks is sufficiently high, either as a result of a separation distance,\nwall loss or the use of separate frequencies for the networks. A synchronized\ndeployment will avoid the cross-link interference, but it will not resolve the\nproblems related to the closed access and the near-far interference. If the\nfactory contains eMBB traffic served by the overlaid macro cells, the\nperformance of both networks will suffer due to a high level of cross-link and\nnear-far interference.

    "abstract": "We propose an approach to modelling large-scale multi-agent dynamical systems\nallowing interactions among more than just pairs of agents using the theory of\nmean-field games and the notion of hypergraphons, which are obtained as limits\nof large hypergraphs. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work on\nmean field games on hypergraphs. Together with an extension to a multi-layer\nsetup, we obtain limiting descriptions for large systems of non-linear,\nweakly-interacting dynamical agents. On the theoretical side, we prove the\nwell-foundedness of the resulting hypergraphon mean field game, showing both\nexistence and approximate Nash properties. On the applied side, we extend\nnumerical and learning algorithms to compute the hypergraphon mean field\nequilibria. To verify our approach empirically, we consider an epidemic control\nproblem and a social rumor spreading model, where we give agents intrinsic\nmotivation to spread rumors to unaware agents.",

We believe that industry and academia need to learn together to\nproduce rigorous and relevant knowledge. In this study, we initiate a\ncollaboration between stakeholders from one case company, one research\ninstitute, and one university. To establish a common view of the problem\ndomain, we applied an interactive rapid review of the state of the art. Four\nresearchers from Lund University and RISE Research Institutes and four\npractitioners from Axis Communications reviewed a set of 180 primary studies on\nML testing. We developed a taxonomy for the communication around ML testing\nchallenges and results and identified a list of 12 review questions relevant\nfor Axis Communications. The three most important questions (data testing,\nmetrics for assessment, and test generation) were mapped to the literature, and\nan in-depth analysis of the 35 primary studies matching the most important\nquestion (data testing) was made. A final set of the five best matches were\nanalysed and we reflect on the criteria for applicability and relevance for the\nindustry. The taxonomies are helpful for communication but not final.\nFurthermore, there was no perfect match to the case company's investigated\nreview question (data testing). However, we extracted relevant approaches from\nthe five studies on a conceptual level to support later context-specific\nimprovements. We found the interactive rapid review approach useful for\ntriggering and aligning communication between the different stakeholders.",

It requires the\ncorrect sizing and the proper utilization of the different sources to guarantee\nthe economical feasibility and the reliability of the supply.

The proposed power management strategy\nguarantees the efficient exploitation of the power sources, which is one of the\nkey elements of the optimal sizing process, being naturally included in the\ndefinition of the energy cost functions. The effectiveness of the power control\nstrategy is validated by means of quasi-dynamic simulations on the complete\nmicrogrid model, where sources are defined by the optimal problem solution,\nwhile the cabling (size and length) and the main switchboards location reflect\nthe expected system layout.

    "abstract": "Segmenting or detecting objects in sparse Lidar point clouds are two\nimportant tasks in autonomous driving to allow a vehicle to act safely in its\n3D environment. The best performing methods in 3D semantic segmentation or\nobject detection rely on a large amount of annotated data. Yet annotating 3D\nLidar data for these tasks is tedious and costly. In this context, we propose a\nself-supervised pre-training method for 3D perception models that is tailored\nto autonomous driving data. Specifically, we leverage the availability of\nsynchronized and calibrated image and Lidar sensors in autonomous driving\nsetups for distilling self-supervised pre-trained image representations into 3D\nmodels. Hence, our method does not require any point cloud nor image\nannotations. The key ingredient of our method is the use of superpixels which\nare used to pool 3D point features and 2D pixel features in visually similar\nregions. We then train a 3D network on the self-supervised task of matching\nthese pooled point features with the corresponding pooled image pixel features.\nThe advantages of contrasting regions obtained by superpixels are that: (1)\ngrouping together pixels and points of visually coherent regions leads to a\nmore meaningful contrastive task that produces features well adapted to 3D\nsemantic segmentation and 3D object detection; (2) all the different regions\nhave the same weight in the contrastive loss regardless of the number of 3D\npoints sampled in these regions; (3) it mitigates the noise produced by\nincorrect matching of points and pixels due to occlusions between the different\nsensors. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving datasets demonstrate the\nability of our image-to-Lidar distillation strategy to produce 3D\nrepresentations that transfer well on semantic segmentation and object\ndetection tasks.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a simple yet universal network termed SeqTR for\nvisual grounding tasks, e.g., phrase localization, referring expression\ncomprehension (REC) and segmentation (RES). The canonical paradigms for visual\ngrounding often require substantial expertise in designing network\narchitectures and loss functions, making them hard to generalize across tasks.\nTo simplify and unify the modeling, we cast visual grounding as a point\nprediction problem conditioned on image and text inputs, where either the\nbounding box or binary mask is represented as a sequence of discrete coordinate\ntokens. Under this paradigm, visual grounding tasks are unified in our SeqTR\nnetwork without task-specific branches or heads, e.g., the convolutional mask\ndecoder for RES, which greatly reduces the complexity of multi-task modeling.\nIn addition, SeqTR also shares the same optimization objective for all tasks\nwith a simple cross-entropy loss, further reducing the complexity of deploying\nhand-crafted loss functions. Experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat the proposed SeqTR outperforms (or is on par with) the existing\nstate-of-the-arts, proving that a simple yet universal approach for visual\ngrounding is indeed feasible.",

    "abstract": "Non-autoregressive translation (NAT) models suffer from inferior translation\nquality due to removal of dependency on previous target tokens from inputs to\nthe decoder. In this paper, we propose a novel and general approach to enhance\nthe target dependency within the NAT decoder from two perspectives: decoder\ninput and decoder self-attention. First, we transform the initial decoder input\nfrom the source language space to the target language space through a novel\nattentive transformation process. The transformation reassembles the decoder\ninput based on target token embeddings and conditions the final output on the\ntarget-side information. Second, before NAT training, we introduce an effective\nforward-backward pre-training phase, implemented with different triangle\nattention masks. This pre-training phase enables the model to gradually learn\nbidirectional dependencies for the final NAT decoding process. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed approaches consistently improve highly\ncompetitive NAT models on four WMT translation directions by up to 1.88 BLEU\nscore, while overall maintaining inference latency comparable to other fully\nNAT models.",

    "abstract": "Multiple object tracking (MOT) is a significant task in achieving autonomous\ndriving. Traditional works attempt to complete this task, either based on point\nclouds (PC) collected by LiDAR, or based on images captured from cameras.\nHowever, relying on one single sensor is not robust enough, because it might\nfail during the tracking process. On the other hand, feature fusion from\nmultiple modalities contributes to the improvement of accuracy. As a result,\nnew techniques based on different sensors integrating features from multiple\nmodalities are being developed. Texture information from RGB cameras and 3D\nstructure information from Lidar have respective advantages under different\ncircumstances. However, it's not easy to achieve effective feature fusion\nbecause of completely distinct information modalities. Previous fusion methods\nusually fuse the top-level features after the backbones extract the features\nfrom different modalities. In this paper, we first introduce PointNet++ to\nobtain multi-scale deep representations of point cloud to make it adaptive to\nour proposed Interactive Feature Fusion between multi-scale features of images\nand point clouds. Specifically, through multi-scale interactive query and\nfusion between pixel-level and point-level features, our method, can obtain\nmore distinguishing features to improve the performance of multiple object\ntracking. Besides, we explore the effectiveness of pre-training on each single\nmodality and fine-tuning on the fusion-based model. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method can achieve good performance on the KITTI benchmark\nand outperform other approaches without using multi-scale feature fusion.\nMoreover, the ablation studies indicates the effectiveness of multi-scale\nfeature fusion and pre-training on single modality.",

Once abnormal KPI\nvalues are observed, root cause analysis (RCA) can be applied to identify the\nreasons for anomalies, so that we can troubleshoot quickly. Recently, several\nautomatic RCA techniques were proposed to localize the related dimensions (or a\ncombination of dimensions) to explain the anomalies. However, their analyses\nare limited to the data on the abnormal metric and ignore the data of other\nmetrics which may be also related to the anomalies, leading to imprecise or\neven incorrect root causes. To this end, we propose a cross-metric\nmulti-dimensional root cause analysis method, named CMMD, which consists of two\nkey components: 1) relationship modeling, which utilizes graph neural network\n(GNN) to model the unknown complex calculation among metrics and aggregation\nfunction among dimensions from historical data; 2) root cause localization,\nwhich adopts the genetic algorithm to efficiently and effectively dive into the\nraw data and localize the abnormal dimension(s) once the KPI anomalies are\ndetected.

Firstly, considering IB-VVC can be formulated as a\nsingle-period optimization problem, we formulate the IB-VVC as a one-step\nMarkov decision process rather than the standard Markov decision process, which\nsimplifies the DRL learning task. Then we design the one-step actor-critic DRL\nscheme which is a simplified version of recent DRL algorithms, and it avoids\nthe issue of Q value overestimation successfully. Furthermore, considering two\nobjectives of VVC: minimizing power loss and eliminating voltage violation, we\nutilize two critics to approximate the rewards of two objectives separately. It\nsimplifies the approximation tasks of each critic, and avoids the interaction\neffect between two objectives in the learning process of critic. The OSTC-DRL\napproach integrates the one-step actor-critic DRL scheme and the two-critic\ntechnology. Based on the OSTC-DRL, we design two centralized DRL algorithms.\nFurther, we extend the OSTC-DRL to multi-agent OSTC-DRL for decentralized\nIB-VVC and design two multi-agent DRL algorithms.

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end approach for detection\nand motion forecasting based on raw sensor measurement as opposed to ground\ntruth tracks. Instead of predicting the current frame locations and forecasting\nforward in time, we directly predict future object locations and backcast to\ndetermine where each trajectory began. Our approach not only improves overall\naccuracy compared to other modular or end-to-end baselines, it also prompts us\nto rethink the role of explicit tracking for embodied perception. Additionally,\nby linking future and current locations in a many-to-one manner, our approach\nis able to reason about multiple futures, a capability that was previously\nconsidered difficult for end-to-end approaches. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on the popular nuScenes dataset and demonstrate the empirical\neffectiveness of our approach. In addition, we investigate the appropriateness\nof reusing standard forecasting metrics for an end-to-end setup, and find a\nnumber of limitations which allow us to build simple baselines to game these\nmetrics.

    "abstract": "Limit cycle oscillations are phenomena arising in nonlinear dynamical systems\nand characterized by periodic, locally-stable, and self-sustained state\ntrajectories. Systems controlled in a closed loop along a periodic trajectory\ncan also be modelled as systems experiencing limit cycle behavior. The goal of\nthis work is to identify from data, the local dynamics around the limit cycle\nusing linear periodically parameter-varying models. Using a coordinate\ntransformation onto transversal surfaces, the dynamics are decomposed into two\nparts: one along the limit cycle, and one on the transversal surfaces. Then,\nthe model is identified from trajectory data using kernel-based methods with a\nperiodic kernel design. The kernel-based model is extended to also account for\nvariations in system parameters associated with different operating conditions.\nThe performance of the proposed identification method is demonstrated on a\nbenchmark nonlinear system and on a simplified airborne wind energy model. The\nmethod provides accurate model parameter estimation, compared to the analytical\nlinearization, and good prediction capability.",

Existing methods applied to such data often do not easily generalize\nto out-of-sample subjects. Instead, models must make predictions on test data\nthat may be drawn from a different distribution, a problem known as\n\\textit{zero-shot learning}. To address this challenge, we develop an\nend-to-end framework using a meta-learning approach, which enables the model to\nrapidly adapt to a new prediction task with limited training data for\nout-of-sample test data. We use three real-world small-scale human subjects\ndatasets (two randomized control studies and one observational study), for\nwhich we predict treatment outcomes for held-out treatment groups. Our model\nlearns the latent treatment effects of each intervention and, by design, can\nnaturally handle multi-task predictions. We show that our model performs the\nbest holistically for each held-out group and especially when the test group is\ndistinctly different from the training group. Our model has implications for\nimproved generalization of small-size human studies to the wider population.",

The key insight of Go-Explore was that\nsuccessful exploration requires an agent to first return to an interesting\nstate ('Go'), and only then explore into unknown terrain ('Explore'). We refer\nto such exploration after a goal is reached as 'post-exploration'. In this\npaper we present a systematic study of post-exploration, answering open\nquestions that the Go-Explore paper did not answer yet. First, we study the\nisolated potential of post-exploration, by turning it on and off within the\nsame algorithm. Subsequently, we introduce new methodology to adaptively decide\nwhen to post-explore and for how long to post-explore. Experiments on a range\nof MiniGrid environments show that post-exploration indeed boosts performance\n(with a bigger impact than tuning regular exploration parameters), and this\neffect is further enhanced by adaptively deciding when and for how long to\npost-explore. In short, our work identifies adaptive post-exploration as a\npromising direction for RL exploration research.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we delve into two key techniques in Semi-Supervised Object\nDetection (SSOD), namely pseudo labeling and consistency training. We observe\nthat these two techniques currently neglect some important properties of object\ndetection, hindering efficient learning on unlabeled data. Specifically, for\npseudo labeling, existing works only focus on the classification score yet fail\nto guarantee the localization precision of pseudo boxes; For consistency\ntraining, the widely adopted random-resize training only considers the\nlabel-level consistency but misses the feature-level one, which also plays an\nimportant role in ensuring the scale invariance. To address the problems\nincurred by noisy pseudo boxes, we design Noisy Pseudo box Learning (NPL) that\nincludes Prediction-guided Label Assignment (PLA) and Positive-proposal\nConsistency Voting (PCV). PLA relies on model predictions to assign labels and\nmakes it robust to even coarse pseudo boxes; while PCV leverages the regression\nconsistency of positive proposals to reflect the localization quality of pseudo\nboxes. Furthermore, in consistency training, we propose Multi-view\nScale-invariant Learning (MSL) that includes mechanisms of both label- and\nfeature-level consistency, where feature consistency is achieved by aligning\nshifted feature pyramids between two images with identical content but varied\nscales. On COCO benchmark, our method, termed PSEudo labeling and COnsistency\ntraining (PseCo), outperforms the SOTA (Soft Teacher) by 2.0, 1.8, 2.0 points\nunder 1%, 5%, and 10% labelling ratios, respectively. It also significantly\nimproves the learning efficiency for SSOD, e.g., PseCo halves the training time\nof the SOTA approach but achieves even better performance.",

However, due to the large amount of parameters and\ncomputational cost, it is rather difficult to apply these methods to multiple\nreal-time remote sensing applications such as on-board data preception on\ndrones and satellites. In this paper, we address this task by developing a\nlight-weight ConvNet named multi-stage duplex fusion network (MSDF-Net). The\nkey idea is to use parameters as little as possible while obtaining as strong\nas possible scene representation capability. To this end, a residual-dense\nduplex fusion strategy is developed to enhance the feature propagation while\nre-using parameters as much as possible, and is realized by our duplex fusion\nblock (DFblock). Specifically, our MSDF-Net consists of multi-stage structures\nwith DFblock. Moreover, duplex semantic aggregation (DSA) module is developed\nto mine the remote sensing scene information from extracted convolutional\nfeatures, which also contains two parallel branches for semantic description.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on three widely-used aerial scene\nclassification benchmarks, and reflect that our MSDF-Net can achieve a\ncompetitive performance against the recent state-of-art while reducing up to\n80% parameter numbers.

Additionally,\nwe have deployed both the hidden volume PDE and the steganographic file system\nat the block layer of the testbed and performed disk forensics to assess\npotential compromises on the raw NAND flash. Our experimental results confirm\nit is indeed possible for the adversary to compromise the block-layer PDE\nsystems by accessing the raw NAND flash in practice. We also discuss potential\nissues when performing such attacks in real world.",

A deep neural network is trained to predict\nthe traversability measures from the local heightmap and target speed. To\nproduce training data, we use an articulated vehicle with wheeled bogie\nsuspensions and procedurally generated terrains. We evaluate the model on\nlaser-scanned forest terrains, previously unseen by the model. The model\npredicts traversability with an accuracy of 90%. Predictions rely on features\nfrom the high-dimensional terrain data that surpass local roughness and slope\nrelative to the heading. Correlations show that the three traversability\nmeasures are complementary to each other. With an inference speed 3000 times\nfaster than the ground truth simulation and trivially parallelizable, the model\nis well suited for traversability analysis and optimal path planning over large\nareas.",

This study evaluated the functionality of the charging\nsystem for 657 EVSE (electric vehicle service equipment) CCS connectors\n(combined charging system) on all 181 open, public DCFC (direct current fast\nchargers) charging stations in the Greater Bay Area.

A random evaluation of 10% of the EVSEs, approximately 8\ndays after the first evaluation, demonstrated no overall change in\nfunctionality. This level of functionality appears to conflict with the 95 to\n98% uptime reported by the EV service providers (EVSPs) who operate the EV\ncharging stations.

    "abstract": "Capsule network (CapsNet) acts as a promising alternative to the typical\nconvolutional neural network, which is the dominant network to develop the\nremaining useful life (RUL) estimation models for mechanical equipment.\nAlthough CapsNet comes with an impressive ability to represent the entities'\nhierarchical relationships through a high-dimensional vector embedding, it\nfails to capture the long-term temporal correlation of run-to-failure time\nseries measured from degraded mechanical equipment. On the other hand, the\nslow-varying dynamics, which reveals the low-frequency information hidden in\nmechanical dynamical behaviour, is overlooked in the existing RUL estimation\nmodels, limiting the utmost ability of advanced networks. To address the\naforementioned concerns, we propose a Slow-varying Dynamics assisted Temporal\nCapsNet (SD-TemCapsNet) to simultaneously learn the slow-varying dynamics and\ntemporal dynamics from measurements for accurate RUL estimation. First, in\nlight of the sensitivity of fault evolution, slow-varying features are\ndecomposed from normal raw data to convey the low-frequency components\ncorresponding to the system dynamics. Next, the long short-term memory (LSTM)\nmechanism is introduced into CapsNet to capture the temporal correlation of\ntime series. To this end, experiments conducted on an aircraft engine and a\nmilling machine verify that the proposed SD-TemCapsNet outperforms the\nmainstream methods. In comparison with CapsNet, the estimation accuracy of the\naircraft engine with four different scenarios has been improved by 10.17%,\n24.97%, 3.25%, and 13.03% concerning the index root mean squared error,\nrespectively. Similarly, the estimation accuracy of the milling machine has\nbeen improved by 23.57% compared to LSTM and 19.54% compared to CapsNet.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac patterns are being used to obtain hard-to-forge biometric signatures\nand have led to high accuracy in state-of-the-art (SoA) identification\napplications. However, this performance is obtained under controlled scenarios\nwhere cardiac signals maintain a relatively uniform pattern, facilitating the\nidentification process. In this work, we analyze cardiac signals collected in\nmore realistic (uncontrolled) scenarios and show that their high signal\nvariability (i.e., irregularity) makes it harder to obtain stable and distinct\nuser features. Furthermore, SoA usually fails to identify specific groups of\nusers, rendering existing identification methods futile in uncontrolled\nscenarios. To solve these problems, we propose a framework with three novel\nproperties. First, we design an adaptive method that achieves stable and\ndistinct features by tailoring the filtering spectrum to each user. Second, we\nshow that users can have multiple cardiac morphologies, offering us a much\nbigger pool of cardiac signals and users compared to SoA. Third, we overcome\nother distortion effects present in authentication applications with a\nmulti-cluster approach and the Mahalanobis distance. Our evaluation shows that\nthe average balanced accuracy (BAC) of SoA drops from above 90% in controlled\nscenarios to 75% in uncontrolled ones, while our method maintains an average\nBAC above 90% in uncontrolled scenarios.",

The dataset\nis constructed using the ERA5 dataset as baseline and it consists of 2004\nannotated images. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset of its kind to be\npublicly released. The dataset is used to train a deep learning model to\nclassify the labeled images. Evaluated on an independent test set, the model\nyields an F-1 score of 0.95, indicating that polar lows can be consistently\ndetected from SAR images. Interpretability techniques applied to the deep\nlearning model reveal that atmospheric fronts and cyclonic eyes are key\nfeatures in the classification. Moreover, experimental results show that the\nmodel is accurate even if: (i) such features are significantly cropped due to\nthe limited swath width of the SAR, (ii) the features are partly covered by sea\nice and (iii) land is covering significant parts of the images. By evaluating\nthe model performance on multiple input image resolutions (pixel sizes of 500m,\n1km and 2km), it is found that higher resolution yield the best performance.\nThis emphasises the potential of using high resolution sensors like SAR for\ndetecting polar lows, as compared to conventionally used sensors such as\nscatterometers.",

    "title": "Surface Vision Transformers: Attention-Based Modelling applied to  Cortical Analysis",
    "abstract": "The extension of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to non-Euclidean\ngeometries has led to multiple frameworks for studying manifolds. Many of those\nmethods have shown design limitations resulting in poor modelling of long-range\nassociations, as the generalisation of convolutions to irregular surfaces is\nnon-trivial. Motivated by the success of attention-modelling in computer\nvision, we translate convolution-free vision transformer approaches to surface\ndata, to introduce a domain-agnostic architecture to study any surface data\nprojected onto a spherical manifold. Here, surface patching is achieved by\nrepresenting spherical data as a sequence of triangular patches, extracted from\na subdivided icosphere. A transformer model encodes the sequence of patches via\nsuccessive multi-head self-attention layers while preserving the sequence\nresolution. We validate the performance of the proposed Surface Vision\nTransformer (SiT) on the task of phenotype regression from cortical surface\nmetrics derived from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP).\nExperiments show that the SiT generally outperforms surface CNNs, while\nperforming comparably on registered and unregistered data. Analysis of\ntransformer attention maps offers strong potential to characterise subtle\ncognitive developmental patterns.",

    "abstract": "We propose 2D Piezoelectric FET (PeFET) based compute-enabled non-volatile\nmemory for ternary deep neural networks (DNNs). PeFETs consist of a material\nwith ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties coupled with Transition Metal\nDichalcogenide channel. We utilize (a) ferroelectricity to store binary bits\n(0/1) in the form of polarization (-P/+P) and (b) polarization dependent\npiezoelectricity to read the stored state by means of strain-induced bandgap\nchange in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide channel. The unique read mechanism of\nPeFETs enables us to expand the traditional association of +P (-P) with low\n(high) resistance states to their dual high (low) resistance depending on read\nvoltage. Specifically, we demonstrate that +P (-P) stored in PeFETs can be\ndynamically configured in (a) a low (high) resistance state for positive read\nvoltages and (b) their dual high (low) resistance states for negative read\nvoltages, without afflicting a read disturb. Such a feature, which we name as\nPolarization Preserved Piezoelectric Effect Reversal with Dual Voltage Polarity\n(PiER), is unique to PeFETs and has not been shown in hitherto explored\nmemories. We leverage PiER to propose a Strain-enabled Ternary Precision\nComputation-in-Memory (STeP-CiM) cell with capabilities of computing the scalar\nproduct of the stored weight and input, both of which are represented with\nsigned ternary precision. Further, using multi word-line assertion of STeP-CiM\ncells, we achieve massively parallel computation of dot products of signed\nternary inputs and weights. Our array level analysis shows 91% lower delay and\nimprovements of 15% and 91% in energy for in-memory multiply-and-accumulate\noperations compared to near-memory design approaches based on SRAM and PeFET\nrespectively. STeP-CiM exhibits upto 8.91x improvement in performance and 6.07x\naverage improvement in energy over SRAM/PeFET based near-memory design.",

    "abstract": "We consider the application of the factor graph framework for symbol\ndetection on linear inter-symbol interference channels. Based on the Ungerboeck\nobservation model, a detection algorithm with appealing complexity properties\ncan be derived. However, since the underlying factor graph contains cycles, the\nsum-product algorithm (SPA) yields a suboptimal algorithm. In this paper, we\ndevelop and evaluate efficient strategies to improve the performance of the\nfactor graph-based symbol detection by means of neural enhancement. In\nparticular, we consider neural belief propagation as an effective way to\nmitigate the effect of cycles within the factor graph. We also investigate the\napplication of factor node generalizations and pruning techniques. By applying\na generic preprocessor to the channel output, we propose a simple technique to\nvary the underlying factor graph in every SPA iteration. Using this dynamic\nfactor graph transition, we intend to preserve the extrinsic nature of the SPA\nmessages which is otherwise impaired due to cycles. Simulation results show\nthat the proposed methods can massively improve the detection performance, even\napproaching the maximum a posteriori performance for various transmission\nscenarios, while preserving a complexity which is linear in both the block\nlength and the channel memory.",

    "abstract": "The upsurge in wireless devices and real-time service demands force the move\nto a higher frequency spectrum. Millimetre-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz)\nbands combined with the beamforming technology offer significant performance\nenhancements for ultra-dense networks (UDNs). Unfortunately, shrinking cell\ncoverage and severe penetration loss experienced at higher spectrum render\nmobility management a critical issue in UDNs, especially optimizing beam\nblockages and frequent handover (HO). Mobility management challenges have\nbecome prevalent in city centres and urban areas. To address this, we propose a\nnovel mechanism driven by exploiting wireless signals and on-road surveillance\nsystems to intelligently predict possible blockages in advance and perform\ntimely HO. This paper employs computer vision (CV) to determine obstacles and\nusers' location and speed. In addition, this study introduces a new HO event,\ncalled block event {BLK}, defined by the presence of a blocking object and a\nuser moving towards the blocked area. Moreover, the multivariate regression\ntechnique predicts the remaining time until the user reaches the blocked area,\nhence determining best HO decision. Compared to typical wireless networks\nwithout blockage prediction, simulation results show that our BLK detection and\nPHO algorithm achieves 40\\% improvement in maintaining user connectivity and\nthe required quality of experience (QoE).",

    "abstract": "This paper is an introductory discussion on the cause of open source software\nvulnerabilities, their importance in the cybersecurity ecosystem, and a\nselection of detection methods. A recent application security report showed 44%\nof applications contain critical vulnerabilities in an open source component, a\nconcerning proportion. Most companies do not have a reliable way of being\ndirectly and promptly notified when zero-day vulnerabilities are found and then\nwhen patches are made available. This means attack vectors in open source exist\nlonger than necessary. Conventional approaches to vulnerability detection are\noutlined alongside some newer research trends. A conclusion is made that it may\nnot be possible to entirely replace expert human inspection of open source\nsoftware, although it can be effectively augmented with techniques such as\nmachine learning, IDE plug-ins and repository linking to make implementation\nand review less time intensive. Underpinning any technological advances should\nbe better knowledge at the human level. Development teams need trained, coached\nand improved so they can implement open source more securely, know what\nvulnerabilities to look for and how to handle them. It is the use of this\nblended approach to detection which is key.",

Regardless of which type of stakeholders are\nconsidered, most works in this area assess the efficacy of fairness\nintervention by evaluating a single fixed fairness criterion through the lens\nof a one-shot, static setting. Yet recommender systems constitute dynamical\nsystems with feedback loops from the recommendations to the underlying\npopulation distributions which could lead to unforeseen and adverse\nconsequences if not taken into account. In this paper, we study a connection\nrecommender system patterned after the systems employed by web-scale social\nnetworks and analyze the long-term effects of intervening on fairness in the\nrecommendations.

    "abstract": "Recent work by Lakshminarayanan and Singh [2020] provided a dual view for\nfully connected deep neural networks (DNNs) with rectified linear units (ReLU).\nIt was shown that (i) the information in the gates is analytically\ncharacterised by a kernel called the neural path kernel (NPK) and (ii) most\ncritical information is learnt in the gates, in that, given the learnt gates,\nthe weights can be retrained from scratch without significant loss in\nperformance. Using the dual view, in this paper, we rethink the conventional\ninterpretations of DNNs thereby explicitsing the implicit interpretability of\nDNNs. Towards this, we first show new theoretical properties namely rotational\ninvariance and ensemble structure of the NPK in the presence of convolutional\nlayers and skip connections respectively. Our theory leads to two surprising\nempirical results that challenge conventional wisdom: (i) the weights can be\ntrained even with a constant 1 input, (ii) the gating masks can be shuffled,\nwithout any significant loss in performance. These results motivate a novel\nclass of networks which we call deep linearly gated networks (DLGNs). DLGNs\nusing the phenomenon of dual lifting pave way to more direct and simpler\ninterpretation of DNNs as opposed to conventional interpretations. We show via\nextensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 that these DLGNs lead to much\nbetter interpretability-accuracy tradeoff.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning is expected to provide strong privacy guarantees, as only\ngradients or model parameters but no plain text training data is ever exchanged\neither between the clients or between the clients and the central server. In\nthis paper, we challenge this claim by introducing a simple but still very\neffective membership inference attack algorithm, which relies only on a single\ntraining step. In contrast to the popular honest-but-curious model, we\ninvestigate a framework with a dishonest central server. Our strategy is\napplicable to models with ReLU activations and uses the properties of this\nactivation function to achieve perfect accuracy. Empirical evaluation on visual\nclassification tasks with MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and CelebA datasets show\nthat our method provides perfect accuracy in identifying one sample in a\ntraining set with thousands of samples. Occasional failures of our method lead\nus to discover duplicate images in the CIFAR100 and CelebA datasets.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence, particularly through recent advancements in deep\nlearning, has achieved exceptional performances in many tasks in fields such as\nnatural language processing and computer vision. In addition to desirable\nevaluation metrics, a high level of interpretability is often required for\nthese models to be reliably utilized. Therefore, explanations that offer\ninsight into the process by which a model maps its inputs onto its outputs are\nmuch sought-after. Unfortunately, current black box nature of machine learning\nmodels is still an unresolved issue and this very nature prevents researchers\nfrom learning and providing explicative descriptions for a model's behavior and\nfinal predictions. In this work, we propose a novel framework utilizing\nAdversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning that can provide global explanations\nfor decisions made by a Reinforcement Learning model and capture intuitive\ntendencies that the model follows by summarizing the model's decision-making\nprocess.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has represented a challenge for higher education in\nterms to provide quality education despite the lockdown periods, the\ntransformation of the in-person classes to virtual classes, and the\ndemotivation and anxiety that are experimented by the students. Because the\nbasis of engineering is the experimentation through hands-on activities and\nlearning by doing, the lockdown periods and the temporary suspension of the\nin-person classes and laboratories have meant a problem for educators that try\nto teach and motivate the students despite the situation. In this context, this\nstudy presents an educational methodology based on Problem-Based Learning (PBL)\nand in-home laboratories in engineering. The methodology was carried out in two\nphases during 2020, in the academic programs of Industrial Engineering and\nTechnology in Electronics with (n=44) students. The in-home laboratories were\nsent to the students as part of \"kits\" with the devices needed in each subject.\nBesides, due to the difficulties in monitoring the learning process, the\nstudents made videos and blogs as a strategy to reinforce their learning and\nevidence the progress in the courses. The outcomes of the methodology show\nmainly the following points: (1) An improvement of the academic performance and\nlearning of the students in the courses. (2) A positive influence of the usage\nof in-home laboratories in motivation, self-efficacy, and reduction of anxiety.\n(3) Positive correlations between the usage of in-home laboratories, the blogs\nand videos, and the teacher's feedback for learning, motivation, and\nself-efficacy. Thus, these results evidence that other alternatives that gather\nthe cognitive and affective learning domains can emerge from engineering to\ndeal with the educational problems produced by the crisis periods.",

In Bayesian regression, we often use a Gaussian observation\nmodel, where we control the level of aleatoric uncertainty with a noise\nvariance parameter. By contrast, for Bayesian classification we use a\ncategorical distribution with no mechanism to represent our beliefs about\naleatoric uncertainty. Our work shows that explicitly accounting for aleatoric\nuncertainty significantly improves the performance of Bayesian neural networks.\nWe note that many standard benchmarks, such as CIFAR, have essentially no\naleatoric uncertainty. Moreover, we show data augmentation in approximate\ninference has the effect of softening the likelihood, leading to\nunderconfidence and profoundly misrepresenting our honest beliefs about\naleatoric uncertainty. Accordingly, we find that a cold posterior, tempered by\na power greater than one, often more honestly reflects our beliefs about\naleatoric uncertainty than no tempering -- providing an explicit link between\ndata augmentation and cold posteriors. We show that we can match or exceed the\nperformance of posterior tempering by using a Dirichlet observation model,\nwhere we explicitly control the level of aleatoric uncertainty, without any\nneed for tempering.",

However, the language customers use may vary from the\nlanguage vendors use on their e-commerce websites and product descriptions.\nThis situation can lead to possible misunderstandings in the social dialogue\nbetween customers, and incidental costs in the dialogue between customers and\nvendors. One possible reason for this difference is that words used by\ncustomers may have different meanings compared to those used by product\ndescription writers. We present a novel approach to measure this potential\nlexical-semantic gap for various e-commerce domains using an\ninformation-theoretical approach based on a large corpus of user reviews and\nproduct descriptions. Additionally, we use neural word embeddings to identify\nwords with the highest semantic drift between reviews and descriptions as a\ntool to construct a ground truth for the task.

The research is exploratory and we contribute empirical insights using\nsurvey-based and artefact-based approaches common in the field of\nHuman-Computer Interaction (HCI). In the former approach, we explore the key\nissues that may limit creative work on paid crowdsourcing platforms. In the\nlatter approach, we create computational artefacts to elicit authentic\nexperiences from both crowd workers and requesters of crowdsourced creative\nwork. The thesis contributes a classification of crowd workers into five\narchetypal profiles, based on the crowd workers' demographics, disposition, and\npreferences for creative work. We propose a three-part classification of\ncreative work on crowdsourcing platforms: creative tasks, creativity tests, and\ncreativity judgements (also referred to as creative feedback). The thesis\nfurther investigates the emerging research topic of how requesters can be\nsupported in interpreting and evaluating complex creative work.

    "abstract": "Audio signals are often stored and transmitted in compressed formats. Among\nthe many available audio compression schemes, MPEG-1 Audio Layer III (MP3) is\nvery popular and widely used. Since MP3 is lossy it leaves characteristic\ntraces in the compressed audio which can be used forensically to expose the\npast history of an audio file. In this paper, we consider the scenario of audio\nsignal manipulation done by temporal splicing of compressed and uncompressed\naudio signals. We propose a method to find the temporal location of the splices\nbased on transformer networks. Our method identifies which temporal portions of\na audio signal have undergone single or multiple compression at the temporal\nframe level, which is the smallest temporal unit of MP3 compression. We tested\nour method on a dataset of 486,743 MP3 audio clips. Our method achieved higher\nperformance and demonstrated robustness with respect to different MP3 data when\ncompared with existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus 2019 has brought severe challenges to social stability and public\nhealth worldwide. One effective way of curbing the epidemic is to require\npeople to wear masks in public places and monitor mask-wearing states by\nutilizing suitable automatic detectors. However, existing deep learning based\nmodels struggle to simultaneously achieve the requirements of both high\nprecision and real-time performance. To solve this problem, we propose an\nimproved lightweight face mask detector based on YOLOv5, which can achieve an\nexcellent balance of precision and speed. Firstly, a novel backbone\nShuffleCANet that combines ShuffleNetV2 network with Coordinate Attention\nmechanism is proposed as the backbone. Then we use BiFPN as the feature fusion\nneck. Furthermore, we replace the loss function of localization with -CIoU to\nobtain higher-quality anchors. Some valuable strategies such as data\naugmentation, adaptive image scaling, and anchor cluster operation are also\nutilized. Experimental results show the performance and effectiveness of the\nproposed model. On the basis of the original YOLOv5 model, our work increases\nthe inference speed by 28.3% while still improving the precision by 0.58% on\nthe AIZOO face mask dataset. It achieves a mean average precision of 95.2%,\nwhich is 4.4% higher than the baseline and is also more accurate compared with\nother existing models.",

    "abstract": "Traditional object detectors employ the dense paradigm of scanning over\nlocations and scales in an image. The recent query-based object detectors break\nthis convention by decoding image features with a set of learnable queries.\nHowever, this paradigm still suffers from slow convergence, limited\nperformance, and design complexity of extra networks between backbone and\ndecoder. In this paper, we find that the key to these issues is the\nadaptability of decoders for casting queries to varying objects. Accordingly,\nwe propose a fast-converging query-based detector, named AdaMixer, by improving\nthe adaptability of query-based decoding processes in two aspects. First, each\nquery adaptively samples features over space and scales based on estimated\noffsets, which allows AdaMixer to efficiently attend to the coherent regions of\nobjects. Then, we dynamically decode these sampled features with an adaptive\nMLP-Mixer under the guidance of each query. Thanks to these two critical\ndesigns, AdaMixer enjoys architectural simplicity without requiring dense\nattentional encoders or explicit pyramid networks. On the challenging MS COCO\nbenchmark, AdaMixer with ResNet-50 as the backbone, with 12 training epochs,\nreaches up to 45.0 AP on the validation set along with 27.9 APs in detecting\nsmall objects. With the longer training scheme, AdaMixer with ResNeXt-101-DCN\nand Swin-S reaches 49.5 and 51.3 AP. Our work sheds light on a simple,\naccurate, and fast converging architecture for query-based object detectors.\nThe code is made available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/AdaMixer",

The self-trained detector, termed as PromptDet,\nsignificantly improves the detection performance on categories for which manual\nannotations are unavailable or hard to obtain, e.g. rare categories.

    "abstract": "Recent advances show that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can\nsynthesize images with smooth variations along semantically meaningful latent\ndirections, such as pose, expression, layout, etc. While this indicates that\nGANs implicitly learn pixel-level correspondences across images, few studies\nexplored how to extract them explicitly. In this work, we introduce Coordinate\nGAN (CoordGAN), a structure-texture disentangled GAN that learns a dense\ncorrespondence map for each generated image. We represent the correspondence\nmaps of different images as warped coordinate frames transformed from a\ncanonical coordinate frame, i.e., the correspondence map, which describes the\nstructure (e.g., the shape of a face), is controlled via a transformation.\nHence, finding correspondences boils down to locating the same coordinate in\ndifferent correspondence maps. In CoordGAN, we sample a transformation to\nrepresent the structure of a synthesized instance, while an independent texture\nbranch is responsible for rendering appearance details orthogonal to the\nstructure. Our approach can also extract dense correspondence maps for real\nimages by adding an encoder on top of the generator. We quantitatively\ndemonstrate the quality of the learned dense correspondences through\nsegmentation mask transfer on multiple datasets.

    "title": "Large-Scale Pre-training for Person Re-identification with Noisy Labels",
    "abstract": "This paper aims to address the problem of pre-training for person\nre-identification (Re-ID) with noisy labels. To setup the pre-training task, we\napply a simple online multi-object tracking system on raw videos of an existing\nunlabeled Re-ID dataset \"LUPerson\" nd build the Noisy Labeled variant called\n\"LUPerson-NL\". Since theses ID labels automatically derived from tracklets\ninevitably contain noises, we develop a large-scale Pre-training framework\nutilizing Noisy Labels (PNL), which consists of three learning modules:\nsupervised Re-ID learning, prototype-based contrastive learning, and\nlabel-guided contrastive learning. In principle, joint learning of these three\nmodules not only clusters similar examples to one prototype, but also rectifies\nnoisy labels based on the prototype assignment. We demonstrate that learning\ndirectly from raw videos is a promising alternative for pre-training, which\nutilizes spatial and temporal correlations as weak supervision. This simple\npre-training task provides a scalable way to learn SOTA Re-ID representations\nfrom scratch on \"LUPerson-NL\" without bells and whistles. For example, by\napplying on the same supervised Re-ID method MGN, our pre-trained model\nimproves the mAP over the unsupervised pre-training counterpart by 5.7%, 2.2%,\n2.3% on CUHK03, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17 respectively. Under the small-scale or\nfew-shot setting, the performance gain is even more significant, suggesting a\nbetter transferability of the learned representation.

    "abstract": "We consider a resource-constrained IoT network, where multiple users make\non-demand requests to a cache-enabled edge node to send status updates about\nvarious random processes, each monitored by an energy harvesting sensor. The\nedge node serves users' requests by deciding whether to command the\ncorresponding sensor to send a fresh status update or retrieve the most\nrecently received measurement from the cache. Our objective is to find the best\nactions of the edge node to minimize the average age of information (AoI) of\nthe received measurements upon request, i.e., average on-demand AoI, subject to\nper-slot transmission and energy constraints. First, we derive a Markov\ndecision process model and propose an iterative algorithm that obtains an\noptimal policy. Then, we develop an asymptotically optimal low-complexity\nalgorithm -- termed relax-then-truncate -- and prove that it is optimal as the\nnumber of sensors goes to infinity. Simulation results illustrate that the\nproposed relax-then-truncate approach significantly reduces the average\non-demand AoI compared to a request-aware greedy (myopic) policy and also\ndepict that it performs close to the optimal solution even for moderate numbers\nof sensors.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how nonpairwise interactions alter dynamical processes in\nnetworks is of fundamental importance to the characterization and control of\nmany coupled systems. Recent discoveries of hyperedge-enhanced synchronization\nunder various settings raised speculations that such enhancements might be a\ngeneral phenomenon. Here, we demonstrate that even for simple systems such as\nKuramoto oscillators, the effects of higher-order interactions are highly\nrepresentation-dependent. Specifically, we show numerically and analytically\nthat hyperedges typically enhance synchronization in random hypergraphs, but\nhave the opposite effect in simplicial complexes. As an explanation, we\nidentify higher-order degree heterogeneity as the key structural determinant of\nsynchronization stability in systems with a fixed coupling budget. Our findings\nhighlight the importance of appropriate representations in describing\nhigher-order interactions. In particular, the choice of simplicial complexes or\nhypergraphs has significant ramifications and should not be purely motivated by\ntechnical conveniences.",

This paper presents a deep convolutional neural network to classify\nburn depth based on altered tissue morphology of burned skin manifested as\ntexture patterns in the ultrasound images. The network first learns a\nlow-dimensional manifold of the unburned skin images using an encoder-decoder\narchitecture that reconstructs it from ultrasound images of burned skin. The\nencoder is then re-trained to classify burn depths. The encoder-decoder network\nis trained using a dataset comprised of B-mode ultrasound images of unburned\nand burned ex vivo porcine skin samples. The classifier is developed using\nB-mode images of burned in situ skin samples obtained from freshly euthanized\npostmortem pigs. The performance metrics obtained from 20-fold cross-validation\nshow that the model can identify deep-partial thickness burns, which is the\nmost difficult to diagnose clinically, with 99% accuracy, 98% sensitivity, and\n100% specificity. The diagnostic accuracy of the classifier is further\nillustrated by the high area under the curve values of 0.99 and 0.95,\nrespectively, for the receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall\ncurves. A post hoc explanation indicates that the classifier activates the\ndiscriminative textural features in the B-mode images for burn classification.\nThe proposed model has the potential for clinical utility in assisting the\nclinical assessment of burn depths using a widely available clinical imaging\ndevice.",

The model fits\nthe data well both in and out of sample across the 50 states of the United\nStates, with comparable $R^2$ scores to state of the art ensemble predictions.\nIn contrast to recent models of epidemics, rather than assuming that\nindividuals directly control the contact rate which governs the spread of\ndisease, we assume that individuals control the rate at which they vary their\nnumber of interactions, i.e. they control the derivative of the contact rate.\nWe propose an implicit feedback law for this control input and verify that it\ncorrelates with policies taken throughout the pandemic. A key takeaway of the\ndynamical model is that the \"stable\" point of case counts is non-zero, i.e.\nCOVID-19 will not be eradicated under the current collection of policies and\nstrategies, and additional policies are needed to fully eradicate it quickly.\nHence, we suggest alternative implicit policies which focus on making\ninterventions (such as vaccinations and mobility restrictions) a function of\ncumulative case counts, for which our results suggest a better possibility of\neradicating COVID-19.",

One challenge\nof such end-to-end solutions is the scarcity of human-annotated phonemes on\nnatural L2 speech. In this work, we leverage unlabeled L2 speech via a\npseudo-labeling (PL) procedure and extend the fine-tuning approach based on\npre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) models. Specifically, we use Wav2vec\n2.0 as our SSL model, and fine-tune it using original labeled L2 speech samples\nplus the created pseudo-labeled L2 speech samples. Our pseudo labels are\ndynamic and are produced by an ensemble of the online model on-the-fly, which\nensures that our model is robust to pseudo label noise. We show that\nfine-tuning with pseudo labels gains a 5.35% phoneme error rate reduction and\n2.48% MDD F1 score improvement over a labeled-samples-only fine-tuning\nbaseline. The proposed PL method is also shown to outperform conventional\noffline PL methods.

However, conventional\ndiffractive neural networks cannot handle OAM modes with a varying spatial\ndistribution of polarization directions. Herein, we propose a polarized optical\ndeep diffractive neural network that is designed based on the concept of\nrectangular micro-structure meta-material. Our proposed polarized optical\ndiffractive neural network is trained to classify, generate, multiplex and\nde-multiplex polarized OAM beams.The simulation results show that our network\nframework can successfully classify 14 kinds of orthogonally polarized vortex\nbeams and de-multiplex the hybrid OAM beams into Gauss beams at two, three and\nfour spatial positions respectively. 6 polarized OAM beams with identical total\nintensity and 8 cylinder vector beams with different topology charges also have\nbeen classified effectively. Additionally, results reveal that the network can\ngenerate hybrid OAM beams with high quality and multiplex two polarized linear\nbeams into 8 kinds of cylinder vector beams.",

Using\nqualitative and quantitative tools, we find that both gender and phone class\ninformation are present in both types of models.

Some language\ninformation can also be retrieved from monolingual models, but it is more\ndiffused across all features. These patterns hold when analyses are carried on\nthe discrete units from a downstream clustering model.

    "abstract": "While phase-aware speech processing has been receiving increasing attention\nin recent years, most narrowband STFT approaches with frame lengths of about\n32ms show a rather modest impact of phase on overall performance. At the same\ntime, modern deep neural network (DNN)-based approaches, like Conv-TasNet, that\nimplicitly modify both magnitude and phase yield great performance on very\nshort frames (2ms). Motivated by this observation, in this paper we\nsystematically investigate the role of phase and magnitude in DNN-based speech\nenhancement for different frame lengths. The results show that a phase-aware\nDNN can take advantage of what previous studies concerning reconstruction of\nclean speech have shown: When using short frames, the phase spectrum becomes\nmore important while the importance of the magnitude spectrum decreases.\nFurthermore, our experiments show that when both magnitude and phase are\nestimated, shorter frames result in a considerably improved performance in a\nDNN with explicit phase estimation. Contrarily, in the phase-blind case, where\nonly magnitudes are processed, 32ms frames lead to the best performance. We\nconclude that DNN-based phase estimation benefits from the use of shorter\nframes and recommend a frame length of about 4ms for future phase-aware deep\nspeech enhancement methods.",

This paper proposes a novel two-stage robust generation dispatch\n(RGD) model, where the curtailment strategy is optimized in the pre-dispatch\nstage. The curtailment strategy will then influence the real-time renewable\npower output, resulting in a decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) set. In the\nre-dispatch stage, the controllable units adjust their outputs within the\nreserve capacities to maintain power balancing. To overcome the difficulty in\nsolving the RGD with DDU, an adaptive column-and-constraint generation (AC&CG)\nalgorithm is developed.

In most cases, such\ndetailed models require a significant amount of computing resources to run.\nOften this may not be afforded and less resource-intensive approaches are\ndesired. In this work, we demonstrate the applicability of Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GAN) as the basis for such fast-simulation models for the\ncase of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) at the MPD detector at the NICA\naccelerator complex. Our prototype GAN-based model of TPC works more than an\norder of magnitude faster compared to the detailed simulation without any\nnoticeable drop in the quality of the high-level reconstruction characteristics\nfor the generated data. Approaches with direct and indirect quality metrics\noptimization are compared.",

    "abstract": "JPEG is a popular image compression method widely used by individuals, data\ncenter, cloud storage and network filesystems. However, most recent progress on\nimage compression mainly focuses on uncompressed images while ignoring\ntrillions of already-existing JPEG images. To compress these JPEG images\nadequately and restore them back to JPEG format losslessly when needed, we\npropose a deep learning based JPEG recompression method that operates on DCT\ndomain and propose a Multi-Level Cross-Channel Entropy Model to compress the\nmost informative Y component. Experiments show that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance compared with traditional JPEG recompression\nmethods including Lepton, JPEG XL and CMIX. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first learned compression method that losslessly transcodes JPEG images\nto more storage-saving bitstreams.",

    "title": "The impact of using voxel-level segmentation metrics on evaluating  multifocal prostate cancer localisation",
    "abstract": "Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distance (HD) are widely used\nfor evaluating medical image segmentation. They have also been criticised, when\nreported alone, for their unclear or even misleading clinical interpretation.\nDSCs may also differ substantially from HDs, due to boundary smoothness or\nmultiple regions of interest (ROIs) within a subject. More importantly, either\nmetric can also have a nonlinear, non-monotonic relationship with outcomes\nbased on Type 1 and 2 errors, designed for specific clinical decisions that use\nthe resulting segmentation. Whilst cases causing disagreement between these\nmetrics are not difficult to postulate. This work first proposes a new\nasymmetric detection metric, adapting those used in object detection, for\nplanning prostate cancer procedures. The lesion-level metrics is then compared\nwith the voxel-level DSC and HD, whereas a 3D UNet is used for segmenting\nlesions from multiparametric MR (mpMR) images. Based on experimental results we\nreport pairwise agreement and correlation 1) between DSC and HD, and 2) between\nvoxel-level DSC and recall-controlled precision at lesion-level, with Cohen's\n[0.49, 0.61] and Pearson's [0.66, 0.76] (p-values}<0.001) at varying cut-offs.\nHowever, the differences in false-positives and false-negatives, between the\nactual errors and the perceived counterparts if DSC is used, can be as high as\n152 and 154, respectively, out of the 357 test set lesions. We therefore\ncarefully conclude that, despite of the significant correlations, voxel-level\nmetrics such as DSC can misrepresent lesion-level detection accuracy for\nevaluating localisation of multifocal prostate cancer and should be interpreted\nwith caution.",

Twenty-two physically active healthy men (age:\n22.89 +- 4.23 years; body mass: 70.74 +- 8.04 kg; height: 1.74 +- 0.76 m) were\nrecruited for the study. The reliability was evaluated by comparing\nmeasurements acquired by the Polar V800 in two identical testing sessions one\nweek apart. Validity was assessed by comparing measurements simultaneously\nobtained using a force platform (gold standard), high-speed camera and the\nPolar V800 during squat jump (SJ) and countermovement jump (CMJ) tests. In the\ntest-retest reliability, high intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were\nobserved (mean: 0.90, SJ and CMJ) in the Polar V800. There was no significant\nsystematic bias +- random errors (p > 0.05) between test-retest. Low\ncoefficients of variation (<5%) were detected in both jumps in the Polar V800.\nIn the validity assessment, similar jump height was detected among devices (p >\n0.05). There was almost perfect agreement between the Polar V800 compared to a\nforce platform for the SJ and CMJ tests (Mean ICCs = 0.95; no systematic bias\n+- random errors in SJ mean: -0.38 +- 2.10 cm, p > 0.05). Mean ICC between the\nPolar V800 versus high-speed camera was 0.91 for the SJ and CMJ tests, however,\na significant systematic bias +- random error (0.97 +- 2.60 cm; p = 0.01) was\ndetected in CMJ test. The Polar V800 offers valid, compared to force platform,\nand reliable information about vertical jump height performance in physically\nactive healthy young men.",

    "title": "Foveation-based Deep Video Compression without Motion Search",
    "abstract": "The requirements of much larger file sizes, different storage formats, and\nimmersive viewing conditions of VR pose significant challenges to the goals of\nacquiring, transmitting, compressing, and displaying high-quality VR content.\nAt the same time, the great potential of deep learning to advance progress on\nthe video compression problem has driven a significant research effort. Because\nof the high bandwidth requirements of VR, there has also been significant\ninterest in the use of space-variant, foveated compression protocols. We have\nintegrated these techniques to create an end-to-end deep learning video\ncompression framework. A feature of our new compression model is that it\ndispenses with the need for expensive search-based motion prediction\ncomputations. This is accomplished by exploiting statistical regularities\ninherent in video motion expressed by displaced frame differences. Foveation\nprotocols are desirable since only a small portion of a video viewed in VR may\nbe visible as a user gazes in any given direction. Moreover, even within a\ncurrent field of view (FOV), the resolution of retinal neurons rapidly\ndecreases with distance (eccentricity) from the projected point of gaze. In our\nlearning based approach, we implement foveation by introducing a Foveation\nGenerator Unit (FGU) that generates foveation masks which direct the allocation\nof bits, significantly increasing compression efficiency while making it\npossible to retain an impression of little to no additional visual loss given\nan appropriate viewing geometry. Our experiment results reveal that our new\ncompression model, which we call the Foveated MOtionless VIdeo Codec (Foveated\nMOVI-Codec), is able to efficiently compress videos without computing motion,\nwhile outperforming foveated version of both H.264 and H.265 on the widely used\nUVG dataset and on the HEVC Standard Class B Test Sequences.",

    "abstract": "In the problem of asymptotic binary i.i.d. state discrimination, the optimal\nasymptotics of the type I and the type II error probabilities is in general an\nexponential decrease to zero as a function of the number of samples; the set of\nachievable exponent pairs is characterized by the quantum Hoeffding bound\ntheorem. A super-exponential decrease for both types of error probabilities is\nonly possible in the trivial case when the two states are orthogonal, and hence\ncan be perfectly distinguished using only a single copy of the system.\nIn this paper we show that a qualitatively different behaviour can occur when\nthere is correlation between the samples. Namely, we use gauge-invariant and\ntranslation-invariant quasi-free states on the algebra of the canonical\nanti-commutation relations to exhibit pairs of states on an infinite spin chain\nwith the properties that a) all finite-size restrictions of the states have\ninvertible density operators, and b) the type I and the type II error\nprobabilities both decrease to zero at least with the speed $e^{-nc\\log n}$\nwith some positive constant $c$, i.e., with a super-exponential speed in the\nsample size $n$.",
