    "abstract": "Metasurfaces have received a lot of attentions recently due to their\nversatile capability in manipulating electromagnetic wave. Advanced designs to\nsatisfy multiple objectives with non-linear constraints have motivated\nresearchers in using machine learning (ML) techniques like deep learning (DL)\nfor accelerated design of metasurfaces. For metasurfaces, it is difficult to\nmake quantitative comparisons between different ML models without having a\ncommon and yet complex dataset used in many disciplines like image\nclassification. Many studies were directed to a relatively constrained datasets\nthat are limited to specified patterns or shapes in metasurfaces. In this\npaper, we present our SUTD polarized reflection of complex metasurfaces\n(SUTD-PRCM) dataset, which contains approximately 260,000 samples of complex\nmetasurfaces created from electromagnetic simulation, and it has been used to\nbenchmark our DL models. The metasurface patterns are divided into different\nclasses to facilitate different degree of complexity, which involves\nidentifying and exploiting the relationship between the patterns and the\nelectromagnetic responses that can be compared in using different DL models.\nWith the release of this SUTD-PRCM dataset, we hope that it will be useful for\nbenchmarking existing or future DL models developed in the ML community. We\nalso propose a classification problem that is less encountered and apply neural\narchitecture search to have a preliminary understanding of potential\nmodification to the neural architecture that will improve the prediction by DL\nmodels. Our finding shows that convolution stacking is not the dominant element\nof the neural architecture anymore, which implies that low-level features are\npreferred over the traditional deep hierarchical high-level features thus\nexplains why deep convolutional neural network based models are not performing\nwell in our dataset.",

    "abstract": "Multiscale modeling is an effective approach for investigating multiphysics\nsystems with largely disparate size features, where models with different\nresolutions or heterogeneous descriptions are coupled together for predicting\nthe system's response. The solver with lower fidelity (coarse) is responsible\nfor simulating domains with homogeneous features, whereas the expensive\nhigh-fidelity (fine) model describes microscopic features with refined\ndiscretization, often making the overall cost prohibitively high, especially\nfor time-dependent problems. In this work, we explore the idea of multiscale\nmodeling with machine learning and employ DeepONet, a neural operator, as an\nefficient surrogate of the expensive solver. DeepONet is trained offline using\ndata acquired from the fine solver for learning the underlying and possibly\nunknown fine-scale dynamics. It is then coupled with standard PDE solvers for\npredicting the multiscale systems with new boundary/initial conditions in the\ncoupling stage. The proposed framework significantly reduces the computational\ncost of multiscale simulations since the DeepONet inference cost is negligible,\nfacilitating readily the incorporation of a plurality of interface conditions\nand coupling schemes. We present various benchmarks to assess accuracy and\nspeedup, and in particular we develop a coupling algorithm for a time-dependent\nproblem, and we also demonstrate coupling of a continuum model (finite element\nmethods, FEM) with a neural operator representation of a particle system\n(Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics, SPH) for a uniaxial tension problem with\nhyperelastic material.

We demonstrate that the DMD computation is more robust than the\nexisting FFT based approach and requires 20 times fewer steps of the wave\nequation to accurately recover the clustering information and reduces the\nrelative error by orders of magnitude.

    "abstract": "The short-term passenger flow prediction of the urban rail transit system is\nof great significance for traffic operation and management. The emerging deep\nlearning-based models provide effective methods to improve prediction accuracy.\nHowever, most of the existing models mainly predict the passenger flow on\ngeneral weekdays, while few studies focus on predicting the holiday passenger\nflow, which can provide more significant information for operators because\ncongestions or accidents generally occur on holidays. To this end, we propose a\ndeep learning-based model named GCN-Transformer comprising graph conventional\nneural network (GCN) and Transformer for short-term passenger flow prediction\non holidays. The GCN is applied to extract the spatial features of passenger\nflows and the Transformer is applied to extract the temporal features of\npassenger flows. Moreover, in addition to the historical passenger flow data,\nsocial media data are also incorporated into the prediction model, which has\nbeen proven to have a potential correlation with the fluctuation of passenger\nflow. The GCN-Transformer is tested on two large-scale real-world datasets from\nNanning, China during the New Year holiday and is compared with several\nconventional prediction models. Results demonstrate its better robustness and\nadvantages among baseline methods, which provides overwhelming support for\npractical applications of short-term passenger flow prediction on holidays",

    "abstract": "Mean-Field Control (MFC) is a powerful tool to solve Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) problems. Recent studies have shown that MFC can\nwell-approximate MARL when the population size is large and the agents are\nexchangeable. Unfortunately, the presumption of exchangeability implies that\nall agents uniformly interact with one another which is not true in many\npractical scenarios. In this article, we relax the assumption of\nexchangeability and model the interaction between agents via an arbitrary\ndoubly stochastic matrix. As a result, in our framework, the mean-field `seen'\nby different agents are different. We prove that, if the reward of each agent\nis an affine function of the mean-field seen by that agent, then one can\napproximate such a non-uniform MARL problem via its associated MFC problem\nwithin an error of $e=\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}[\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{X}|} +\n\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{U}|}])$ where $N$ is the population size and $|\\mathcal{X}|$,\n$|\\mathcal{U}|$ are the sizes of state and action spaces respectively.

    "abstract": "Tensegrity robots, composed of rigid rods and flexible cables, are difficult\nto accurately model and control given the presence of complex dynamics and high\nnumber of DoFs. Differentiable physics engines have been recently proposed as a\ndata-driven approach for model identification of such complex robotic systems.\nThese engines are often executed at a high-frequency to achieve accurate\nsimulation. Ground truth trajectories for training differentiable engines,\nhowever, are not typically available at such high frequencies due to\nlimitations of real-world sensors. The present work focuses on this frequency\nmismatch, which impacts the modeling accuracy. We proposed a recurrent\nstructure for a differentiable physics engine of tensegrity robots, which can\nbe trained effectively even with low-frequency trajectories. To train this new\nrecurrent engine in a robust way, this work introduces relative to prior work:\n(i) a new implicit integration scheme, (ii) a progressive training pipeline,\nand (iii) a differentiable collision checker. A model of NASA's icosahedron\nSUPERballBot on MuJoCo is used as the ground truth system to collect training\ndata. Simulated experiments show that once the recurrent differentiable engine\nhas been trained given the low-frequency trajectories from MuJoCo, it is able\nto match the behavior of MuJoCo's system. The criterion for success is whether\na locomotion strategy learned using the differentiable engine can be\ntransferred back to the ground-truth system and result in a similar motion.\nNotably, the amount of ground truth data needed to train the differentiable\nengine, such that the policy is transferable to the ground truth system, is 1%\nof the data needed to train the policy directly on the ground-truth system.",

Compared to the local CC-OPF within a regional grid, the global\nCC-OPF of a multi-regional interconnected grid is able to coordinate across\ndifferent regions and therefore improve the economic efficiency when\nintegrating high percentage of wind power generation. In this global problem,\nhowever, multiple regional independent system operators (ISOs) participate in\nthe decision-making process, raising the need for distributed but coordinated\napproaches. Most notably, due to regulation restrictions, commercial interest,\nand data security, regional ISOs may refuse to share confidential information\nwith others, including generation cost, load data, system topologies, and line\nparameters. But this information is needed to build and solve the global CC-OPF\nspanning multiple areas. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a\ndistributed CC-OPF method with confidentiality preservation, which enables\nregional ISOs to determine the optimal dispatchable generations within their\nregions without disclosing confidential data.

Second, we\nreplace multiple learned fine-tuning steps by a single instance optimisation\nwith hand-crafted features and the Adam optimiser. Different to other related\nwork, including FlowNet or PDD-Net, our approach does not require a fully\ndiscretised architecture with correlation layer.

One of the key innovations is that the underlying\nvolumetric representation is completely explicit in contrast to neural\nnetwork-based (implicit) alternatives. We encode scenes explicitly using clear\nand understandable mappings of optimization variables to scene geometry and\ntheir outgoing surface radiance. We represent them using hierarchical\nvolumetric fields stored in a sparse voxel octree. Robustly reconstructing such\na volumetric scene model with millions of unknown variables from registered\nscene images only is a highly non-convex and complex optimization problem. To\nthis end, we employ stochastic gradient descent (Adam) which is steered by an\ninverse differentiable renderer.\nWe demonstrate that our method can reconstruct models of high quality that\nare comparable to state-of-the-art implicit methods. Importantly, we do not use\na sequential reconstruction pipeline where individual steps suffer from\nincomplete or unreliable information from previous stages, but start our\noptimizations from uniformed initial solutions with scene geometry and radiance\nthat is far off from the ground truth.

    "abstract": "Learning policies that effectually utilize language instructions in complex,\nmulti-task environments is an important problem in imitation learning. While it\nis possible to condition on the entire language instruction directly, such an\napproach could suffer from generalization issues. To encode complex\ninstructions into skills that can generalize to unseen instructions, we propose\nLearning Interpretable Skill Abstractions (LISA), a hierarchical imitation\nlearning framework that can learn diverse, interpretable skills from\nlanguage-conditioned demonstrations. LISA uses vector quantization to learn\ndiscrete skill codes that are highly correlated with language instructions and\nthe behavior of the learned policy. In navigation and robotic manipulation\nenvironments, LISA is able to outperform a strong non-hierarchical baseline in\nthe low data regime and compose learned skills to solve tasks containing unseen\nlong-range instructions. Our method demonstrates a more natural way to\ncondition on language in sequential decision-making problems and achieve\ninterpretable and controllable behavior with the learned skills.",

Yet,\nlittle is known about how post-hoc explanations and inherently faithful models\nperform in out-of-domain settings. In this paper, we conduct an extensive\nempirical study that examines: (1) the out-of-domain faithfulness of post-hoc\nexplanations, generated by five feature attribution methods; and (2) the\nout-of-domain performance of two inherently faithful models over six datasets.\nContrary to our expectations, results show that in many cases out-of-domain\npost-hoc explanation faithfulness measured by sufficiency and comprehensiveness\nis higher compared to in-domain. We find this misleading and suggest using a\nrandom baseline as a yardstick for evaluating post-hoc explanation\nfaithfulness.

Mouse\nretinal OCT images are often collected for longitudinal study of eye disease\nmodels such as uveitis, but their quality is often poor compared with human\nimaging. This paper presents a novel but efficient framework involving an\noptimal transport based graph matching (OT-GM) method for 3D mouse OCT image\nregistration. We first perform registration of fundus-like images obtained by\nprojecting all b-scans of a volume on a plane orthogonal to them, hereafter\nreferred to as the x-y plane. We introduce Adaptive Weighted Vessel Graph\nDescriptors (AWVGD) and 3D Cube Descriptors (CD) to identify the correspondence\nbetween nodes of graphs extracted from segmented vessels within the OCT\nprojection images. The AWVGD comprises scaling, translation and rotation, which\nare computationally efficient, whereas CD exploits 3D spatial and frequency\ndomain information. The OT-GM method subsequently performs the correct\nalignment in the x-y plane. Finally, registration along the direction\northogonal to the x-y plane (the z-direction) is guided by the segmentation of\ntwo important anatomical features peculiar to mouse b-scans, the Internal\nLimiting Membrane (ILM) and the hyaloid remnant (HR).

Deep models\ncan be used to initially localise various structures in the tissue and hence\nfacilitate the extraction of interpretable features for biomarker discovery.\nHowever, these models are typically trained for a single task and therefore\nscale poorly as we wish to adapt the model for an increasing number of\ndifferent tasks. Also, supervised deep learning models are very data hungry and\ntherefore rely on large amounts of training data to perform well. In this paper\nwe present a multi-task learning approach for segmentation and classification\nof nuclei, glands, lumen and different tissue regions that leverages data from\nmultiple independent data sources. While ensuring that our tasks are aligned by\nthe same tissue type and resolution, we enable simultaneous prediction with a\nsingle network.

In this paper, we\nshow that converting depth maps into pseudo-LiDAR signals, previously shown to\nbe useful for 3D object detection, is a better representation for camera\nlocalization tasks by projecting point clouds that can accurately determine\n6DOF camera pose. This is demonstrated by first comparing localization\naccuracies of a network operating exclusively on pseudo-LiDAR representations,\nwith networks operating exclusively on depth maps. We then propose FusionLoc, a\nnovel architecture that uses pseudo-LiDAR to regress a 6DOF camera pose.\nFusionLoc is a dual stream neural network, which aims to remedy common issues\nwith typical 2D CNNs operating on RGB-D images. The results from this\narchitecture are compared against various other state-of-the-art deep pose\nregression implementations using the 7 Scenes dataset.

To the best of\nour knowledge, the majority of state-of-the-art works neglects competitors.\nThis leads to a mismatch with the real world, where traffic generates\nconsiderable time losses. To bridge this gap, we propose a new framework to\noffline compute optimal strategies for the powertrain energy management\nconsidering competitors.

Despite their success, the high complexity of the\nattention mechanism hinders them from being applied to latency-sensitive tasks.\nTremendous efforts have been made to alleviate this problem, and many of them\nsuccessfully reduce the asymptotic complexity to linear. Nevertheless, most of\nthem fail to achieve practical speedup over the original full attention under\nmoderate sequence lengths and are unfriendly to finetuning. In this paper, we\npresent DFSS, an attention mechanism that dynamically prunes the full attention\nweight matrix to N:M fine-grained structured sparse pattern. We provide both\ntheoretical and empirical evidence that demonstrates DFSS is a good\napproximation of the full attention mechanism. We propose a dedicated CUDA\nkernel design that completely eliminates the dynamic pruning overhead and\nachieves speedups under arbitrary sequence length. We evaluate the 1:2 and 2:4\nsparsity under different configurations and achieve 1.27~ 1.89x speedups over\nthe full-attention mechanism. It only takes a couple of finetuning epochs from\nthe pretrained model to achieve on par accuracy with full attention mechanism\non tasks from various domains under different sequence lengths from 384 to\n4096.",

    "abstract": "We study a control problem for queueing systems where customers may return\nfor additional episodes of service after their initial service completion. At\neach service completion epoch, the decision maker can choose to reduce the\nprobability of return for the departing customer but at a cost that is convex\nincreasing in the amount of reduction in the return probability. Other costs\nare incurred as customers wait in the queue and every time they return for\nservice. Our primary motivation comes from post-discharge Quality Improvement\n(QI) interventions (e.g., follow up phone-calls, appointments) frequently used\nin a variety of healthcare settings to reduce unplanned hospital readmissions.\nOur objective is to understand how the cost of interventions should be balanced\nwith the reductions in congestion and service costs. To this end, we consider a\nfluid approximation of the queueing system and characterize the structure of\noptimal long-run average and bias-optimal transient control policies for the\nfluid model. Our structural results motivate the design of intuitive surge\nprotocols whereby different intensities of interventions (corresponding to\ndifferent levels of reduction in the return probability) are provided based on\nthe congestion in the system. Through extensive simulation experiments, we\nstudy the performance of the fluid policy for the stochastic system and\nidentify parameter regimes where it leads to significant cost savings compared\nto a fixed long-run average optimal policy that ignores holding costs and a\nsimple policy that uses the highest level of intervention whenever the queue is\nnon-empty. In particular, we find that in a parameter regime relevant to our\nmotivating application, dynamically adjusting the intensity of interventions\ncould result in up to 25.4% reduction in long-run average cost and 33.7% in\nfinite-horizon costs compared to the simple aggressive policy.",

In the course of our work on\nGNN infrastructure and open-source software at Google, we have sought to\ndevelop improved benchmarks that are robust, tunable, scalable,and\ngeneralizable.

Using GraphWorld, a user has\nfine-grained control over graph generator parameters, and can benchmark\narbitrary GNN models with built-in hyperparameter tuning. We present insights\nfrom GraphWorld experiments regarding the performance characteristics of tens\nof thousands of GNN models over millions of benchmark datasets. We further show\nthat GraphWorld efficiently explores regions of benchmark dataset space\nuncovered by standard benchmarks, revealing comparisons between models that\nhave not been historically obtainable.

    "abstract": "Both a good understanding of geometrical concepts and a broad familiarity\nwith objects lead to our excellent perception of moving objects. The human\nability to detect and segment moving objects works in the presence of multiple\nobjects, complex background geometry, motion of the observer and even\ncamouflage. How humans perceive moving objects so reliably is a longstanding\nresearch question in computer vision and borrows findings from related areas\nsuch as psychology, cognitive science and physics. One approach to the problem\nis to teach a deep network to model all of these effects. This contrasts with\nthe strategy used by human vision, where cognitive processes and body design\nare tightly coupled and each is responsible for certain aspects of correctly\nidentifying moving objects. Similarly from the computer vision perspective,\nthere is evidence that classical, geometry-based techniques are better suited\nto the \"motion-based\" parts of the problem, while deep networks are more\nsuitable for modeling appearance. In this work, we argue that the coupling of\ncamera rotation and camera translation can create complex motion fields that\nare difficult for a deep network to untangle directly. We present a novel\nprobabilistic model to estimate the camera's rotation given the motion field.\nWe then rectify the flow field to obtain a rotation-compensated motion field\nfor subsequent segmentation. This strategy of first estimating camera motion,\nand then allowing a network to learn the remaining parts of the problem, yields\nimproved results on the widely used DAVIS benchmark as well as the recently\npublished motion segmentation data set MoCA (Moving Camouflaged Animals).",

In a smart warehouse the main tasks consist of employing a fleet\nof automated picking and mobile robots that coordinate by picking up items from\na set of orders from the shelves and dropping them at the delivery stations.\nTwo aspects generally justify multi-robot task allocation complexity: (i)\nenvironmental aspects, such as multi-delivery stations and dispersed robots\n(since they remain in constant motion) and (ii) fleet heterogeneity, where\nrobots' traffic speed and capacity loads are different from each other. Despite\nthese properties have been widely researched in the literature, they usually\nare investigated separately. This work proposes a scalable and efficient task\nallocation algorithm for smart warehouses with multi-delivery stations and\nheterogeneous fleets. Our strategy employs a novel cost estimator, which\ncomputes costs as a function of the robots' variable characteristics and\ncapacity while they receive new tasks. For validating the strategy a series of\nexperiments is performed simulating the operation of smart warehouses with\nmultiple delivery stations and heteregenous fleets. The results show that our\nstrategy generates routes costing up to $33$\\% less than the routes generated\nby a state-of-the-art task allocation algorithm and $96$\\% faster in test\ninstances representing our target scenario.

    "abstract": "Transformers have emerged to be successful in a number of natural language\nprocessing and vision tasks, but their potential applications to medical\nimaging remain largely unexplored due to the unique difficulties of this field.\nIn this study, we present UTNetV2, a simple yet powerful backbone model that\ncombines the strengths of the convolutional neural network and Transformer for\nenhancing performance and efficiency in medical image segmentation. The\ncritical design of UTNetV2 includes three innovations: (1) We used a hybrid\nhierarchical architecture by introducing depthwise separable convolution to\nprojection and feed-forward network in the Transformer block, which brings\nlocal relationship modeling and desirable properties of CNNs (translation\ninvariance) to Transformer, thus eliminate the requirement of large-scale\npre-training. (2) We proposed efficient bidirectional attention (B-MHA) that\nreduces the quadratic computation complexity of self-attention to linear by\nintroducing an adaptively updated semantic map.

    "title": "Setting Fair Incentives to Maximize Improvement",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of helping agents improve by setting short-term\ngoals. Given a set of target skill levels, we assume each agent will try to\nimprove from their initial skill level to the closest target level within reach\nor do nothing if no target level is within reach. We consider two models: the\ncommon improvement capacity model, where agents have the same limit on how much\nthey can improve, and the individualized improvement capacity model, where\nagents have individualized limits. Our goal is to optimize the target levels\nfor social welfare and fairness objectives, where social welfare is defined as\nthe total amount of improvement, and fairness objectives are considered where\nthe agents belong to different underlying populations. A key technical\nchallenge of this problem is the non-monotonicity of social welfare in the set\nof target levels, i.e., adding a new target level may decrease the total amount\nof improvement as it may get easier for some agents to improve. This is\nespecially challenging when considering multiple groups because optimizing\ntarget levels in isolation for each group and outputting the union may result\nin arbitrarily low improvement for a group, failing the fairness objective.\nConsidering these properties, we provide algorithms for optimal and\nnear-optimal improvement for both social welfare and fairness objectives. These\nalgorithmic results work for both the common and individualized improvement\ncapacity models. Furthermore, we show a placement of target levels exists that\nis approximately optimal for the social welfare of each group. Unlike the\nalgorithmic results, this structural statement only holds in the common\nimprovement capacity model, and we show counterexamples in the individualized\nimprovement capacity model. Finally, we extend our algorithms to learning\nsettings where we have only sample access to the initial skill levels of\nagents.",

This paper proposes a\ndecomposition of the C-Index into a weighted harmonic mean of two quantities:\none for ranking observed events versus other observed events, and the other for\nranking observed events versus censored cases. This decomposition allows a more\nfine-grained analysis of the pros and cons of survival prediction methods. The\nutility of the decomposition is demonstrated using three benchmark survival\nanalysis models (Cox Proportional Hazard, Random Survival Forest, and Deep\nAdversarial Time-to-Event Network) together with a new variational generative\nneural-network-based method (SurVED), which is also proposed in this paper. The\ndemonstration is done on four publicly available datasets with varying\ncensoring levels. The analysis with the C-index decomposition shows that all\nmethods essentially perform equally well when the censoring level is high\nbecause of the dominance of the term measuring the ranking of events versus\ncensored cases. In contrast, some methods deteriorate when the censoring level\ndecreases because they do not rank the events versus other events well.",

    "abstract": "As a method of universal approximation deep neural networks (DNNs) are\ncapable of finding approximate solutions to problems posed with little more\nconstraints than a suitably-posed mathematical system and an objective\nfunction. Consequently, DNNs have considerably more flexibility in applications\nthan classical numerical methods. On the other hand they offer an uncontrolled\napproximation to the sought-after mathematical solution. This suggests that\nhybridization of classical numerical methods with DNN-based approximations may\nbe a desirable approach. In this work a DNN-based approximator inspired by the\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINNs) methodology is used to provide an\ninitial guess to a Newton's method iteration of a very-high order implicit\nRunge-Kutta (IRK) integration of a nonlinear system of ODEs, namely the Lorenz\nsystem. In the usual approach many explicit timesteps are needed to provide a\nguess to the implicit system's nonlinear solver, requiring enough work to make\nthe IRK method infeasible. The DNN-based approach described in this work\nenables large implicit time-steps to be taken to any desired degree of accuracy\nfor as much effort as it takes to converge the DNN solution to within a few\npercent accuracy.

Machine learning (ML) models form\nthe basis of many such AI systems.

    "abstract": "Increasing the explainability of deep neural networks (DNNs) requires\nevaluating whether they implement symbolic computation. One central symbolic\ncapacity is variable binding: linking an input value to an abstract variable\nheld in system-internal memory. Prior work on the computational abilities of\nDNNs has not resolved the question of whether their internal processes involve\nvariable binding. We argue that the reason for this is fundamental, inherent in\nthe way experiments in prior work were designed. We provide the first\nsystematic evaluation of the variable binding capacities of the\nstate-of-the-art Transformer networks BERT and RoBERTa. Our experiments are\ndesigned such that the model must generalize a rule across disjoint subsets of\nthe input vocabulary, and cannot rely on associative pattern matching alone.\nThe results show a clear discrepancy between classification and\nsequence-to-sequence tasks: BERT and RoBERTa can easily learn to copy or\nreverse strings even when trained on task-specific vocabularies that are\nswitched in the test set; but both models completely fail to generalize across\nvocabularies in similar sequence classification tasks. These findings indicate\nthat the effectiveness of Transformers in sequence modelling may lie in their\nextensive use of the input itself as an external \"memory\" rather than\nnetwork-internal symbolic operations involving variable binding. Therefore, we\npropose a novel direction for future work: augmenting the inputs available to\ncircumvent the lack of network-internal variable binding.",

Multi-Vehicle Pursuit games (MVP), a multi-vehicle cooperative\nability to capture mobile targets, is becoming a hot research topic gradually.\nAlthough there are some achievements in the field of MVP in the open space\nenvironment, the urban area brings complicated road structures and restricted\nmoving spaces as challenges to the resolution of MVP games. We define an\nObservation-constrained MVP (OMVP) problem in this paper and propose a\nTransformer-based Time and Team Reinforcement Learning scheme ($ \\text{T}^3\n$OMVP) to address the problem. First, a new multi-vehicle pursuit model is\nconstructed based on decentralized partially observed Markov decision processes\n(Dec-POMDP) to instantiate this problem. Second, by introducing and modifying\nthe transformer-based observation sequence, QMIX is redefined to adapt to the\ncomplicated road structure, restricted moving spaces and constrained\nobservations, so as to control vehicles to pursue the target combining the\nvehicle's observations. Third, a multi-intersection urban environment is built\nto verify the proposed scheme.

This is distinct from the general unsupervised contrastive learning\nthat assumes an image and its augmentations share a similar representation.\nSpecifically, relation graphs are constructed using the nearest neighbours to\nidentify existing similar samples, then the constructed inter-instance relation\ngraphs are transferred to the missing views to build graphs on the\ncorresponding missing data. Subsequently, two main components, within-view\ngraph contrastive learning (WGC) and cross-view graph consistency learning\n(CGC), are devised to maximize the mutual information of different views within\na cluster. The proposed approach elevates instance-level contrastive learning\nand missing data inference to the cluster-level, effectively mitigating the\nimpact of individual missing data on clustering.

There can also be loss of\ndiscriminative visual features due to poor lighting. In this paper, we present\na novel multimodal person detection architecture to address the mobile robot\nproblem of person detection under intraclass variations. We present a two-stage\ntraining approach using 1) a unique pretraining method we define as Temporal\nInvariant Multimodal Contrastive Learning (TimCLR), and 2) a Multimodal Faster\nR-CNN (MFRCNN) detector. TimCLR learns person representations that are\ninvariant under intraclass variations through unsupervised learning. Our\napproach is unique in that it generates image pairs from natural variations\nwithin multimodal image sequences, in addition to synthetic data augmentation,\nand contrasts crossmodal features to transfer invariances between different\nmodalities. These pretrained features are used by the MFRCNN detector for\nfinetuning and person detection from RGB-D images. Extensive experiments\nvalidate the performance of our DL architecture in both human-centered crowded\nand cluttered environments.

Frequently it is expensive to gather\nlabelled observations of data, making the usage of deep learning models not\nideal, as the model might over-fit data. In a semi-supervised setting,\nunlabelled data is used to improve the levels of accuracy and generalization of\na model with small labelled datasets.

This raises the risk of a\nsignificant distribution mismatch between the labelled and unlabelled datasets.\nSuch phenomena can cause a considerable performance hit to typical\nsemi-supervised deep learning frameworks, which often assume that both labelled\nand unlabelled datasets are drawn from similar distributions. Therefore, in\nthis paper we study the latest approaches for semi-supervised deep learning for\nimage recognition.

    "abstract": "Systematic techniques to improve quality of deep neural networks (DNNs) are\ncritical given the increasing demand for practical applications including\nsafety-critical ones. The key challenge comes from the little controllability\nin updating DNNs. Retraining to fix some behavior often has a destructive\nimpact on other behavior, causing regressions, i.e., the updated DNN fails with\ninputs correctly handled by the original one. This problem is crucial when\nengineers are required to investigate failures in intensive assurance\nactivities for safety or trust. Search-based repair techniques for DNNs have\npotentials to tackle this challenge by enabling localized updates only on\n\"responsible parameters\" inside the DNN. However, the potentials have not been\nexplored to realize sufficient controllability to suppress regressions in DNN\nrepair tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel DNN repair method that makes\nuse of the training history for judging which DNN parameters should be changed\nor not to suppress regressions. We implemented the method into a tool called\nNeuRecover and evaluated it with three datasets. Our method outperformed the\nexisting method by achieving often less than a quarter, even a tenth in some\ncases, number of regressions. Our method is especially effective when the\nrepair requirements are tight to fix specific failure types. In such cases, our\nmethod showed stably low rates (<2%) of regressions, which were in many cases a\ntenth of regressions caused by retraining.",

In many parameter settings used in practice this is a\nsignificant improvement over the $ O(n+k^2)$ computation cost that is achieved\nby the recent PI-RAPPOR algorithm (Feldman and Talwar; 2021). Our empirical\nevaluation shows a speedup of over 50x over PI-RAPPOR while using approximately\n75x less memory for practically relevant parameter settings.

In this study, we explore how the class\nimbalance problem affects 3DSS performance and whether the model can detect the\ncategory prediction correctness, or whether data is ID (in-distribution) or\nOOD. For these purposes, we conduct two experiments using three representative\n3DSS models and five trust scoring methods, and conduct both a confusion and\nfeature analysis of each class. Furthermore, a data augmentation method for the\n3D LiDAR dataset is proposed to create a new dataset based on SemanticKITTI and\nSemanticPOSS, called AugKITTI. We propose the wPre metric and TSD for a more\nin-depth analysis of the results, and follow are proposals with an insightful\ndiscussion. Based on the experimental results, we find that: (1) the classes\nare not only imbalanced in their data size but also in the basic properties of\neach semantic category. (2) The intraclass diversity and interclass ambiguity\nmake class learning difficult and greatly limit the models' performance,\ncreating the challenges of semantic and data gaps. (3) The trust scores are\nunreliable for classes whose features are confused with other classes. For 3DSS\nmodels, those misclassified ID classes and OODs may also be given high trust\nscores, making the 3DSS predictions unreliable, and leading to the challenges\nin judging 3DSS result trustworthiness.

    "title": "Specialized Accelerators and Compiler Flows: Replacing Accelerator APIs  with a Formal Software/Hardware Interface",
    "abstract": "Specialized accelerators are increasingly used to meet the power-performance\ngoals of emerging applications such as machine learning, image processing, and\ngraph analysis. Existing accelerator programming methodologies using APIs have\nseveral limitations: (1) The application code lacks portability to other\nplatforms and compiler frameworks; (2) the lack of integration of accelerator\ncode in the compiler limits useful optimizations such as instruction selection\nand operator fusion; and (3) the opacity of the accelerator function semantics\nlimits the ability to check the final code for correctness. The root of these\nlimitations is the lack of a formal software/hardware interface specification\nfor accelerators.\nIn this paper, we use the recently developed Instruction-Level Abstraction\n(ILA) for accelerators to serve this purpose, similar to how the Instruction\nSet Architecture (ISA) has been used as the software/hardware interface for\nprocessors. We propose a compiler flow termed D2A using the ILA and present a\nprototype that demonstrates this flow for deep learning (DL) applications. This\nprototype compiles programs from high-level domain-specific languages, e.g.,\nPyTorch and MxNet, to multiple target accelerators with no target-specific\nextensions to the application or compiler - thus demonstrating application\nportability. It includes compiler optimizations through instruction selection\nusing equality saturation-based flexible matching. Finally, we show checking\nthe correctness of the resulting code through formal verification of individual\nmatched operations and fully automated simulation-based validation of complete\napplications. The evaluation of the prototype compiler is based on six\ndifferent DL applications and three different accelerators. Overall, this\nmethodology lays the foundation for integrating accelerators in compiler flows\nusing a formal software/hardware interface.",

    "abstract": "As Smart Meters are collecting and transmitting household energy consumption\ndata to Retail Energy Providers (REP), the main challenge is to ensure the\neffective use of fine-grained consumer data while ensuring data privacy. In\nthis manuscript, we tackle this challenge for energy load consumption\nforecasting in regards to REPs which is essential to energy demand management,\nload switching and infrastructure development. Specifically, we note that\nexisting energy load forecasting is centralized, which are not scalable and\nmost importantly, vulnerable to data privacy threats. Besides, REPs are\nindividual market participants and liable to ensure the privacy of their own\ncustomers. To address this issue, we propose a novel horizontal\nprivacy-preserving federated learning framework for REPs energy load\nforecasting, namely FedREP. We consider a federated learning system consisting\nof a control centre and multiple retailers by enabling multiple REPs to build a\ncommon, robust machine learning model without sharing data, thus addressing\ncritical issues such as data privacy, data security and scalability. For\nforecasting, we use a state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural\nnetwork due to its ability to learn long term sequences of observations and\npromises of higher accuracy with time-series data while solving the vanishing\ngradient problem. Finally, we conduct extensive data-driven experiments using a\nreal energy consumption dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed federated learning framework can achieve sufficient performance in\nterms of MSE ranging between 0.3 to 0.4 and is relatively similar to that of a\ncentralized approach while preserving privacy and improving scalability.",

    "abstract": "Approximate Message Passing (AMP) is an efficient iterative\nparameter-estimation technique for certain high-dimensional linear systems with\nnon-Gaussian distributions, such as sparse systems. In AMP, a so-called Onsager\nterm is added to keep estimation errors approximately Gaussian. Orthogonal AMP\n(OAMP) does not require this Onsager term, relying instead on an\northogonalization procedure to keep the current errors uncorrelated with (i.e.,\northogonal to) past errors. In this paper, we show that the orthogonality in\nOAMP ensures that errors are \"asymptotically independently and identically\ndistributed Gaussian\" (AIIDG). This AIIDG property, which is essential for the\nattractive performance of OAMP, holds for separable functions. We present a\nprocedure to realize the required orthogonality for OAMP through Gram-Schmidt\northogonalization (GSO). We show that expectation propagation (EP), AMP, OAMP\nand some other algorithms can be unified under this orthogonality framework.\nThe simplicity and generality of OAMP provide efficient solutions for\nestimation problems beyond the classical linear models; related applications\nwill be discussed in a companion paper where new algorithms are developed for\nproblems with multiple constraints and multiple measurement variables.",

For\nexample, GTC was first used to encode an N-best list of pseudo-label sequences\ninto a graph for semi-supervised learning. In this paper, we propose an\nextension of GTC to model the posteriors of both labels and label transitions\nby a neural network, which can be applied to a wider range of tasks. As an\nexample application, we use the extended GTC (GTC-e) for the multi-speaker\nspeech recognition task. The transcriptions and speaker information of\nmulti-speaker speech are represented by a graph, where the speaker information\nis associated with the transitions and ASR outputs with the nodes. Using GTC-e,\nmulti-speaker ASR modelling becomes very similar to single-speaker ASR\nmodeling, in that tokens by multiple speakers are recognized as a single merged\nsequence in chronological order. For evaluation, we perform experiments on a\nsimulated multi-speaker speech dataset derived from LibriSpeech, obtaining\npromising results with performance close to classical benchmarks for the task.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental task underlying many important optimization problems, from\ninfluence maximization to sensor placement to content recommendation, is to\nselect the optimal group of $k$ items from a larger set. Submodularity has been\nvery effective in allowing approximation algorithms for such subset selection\nproblems. However, in several applications, we are interested not only in the\nelements of a set, but also the order in which they appear, breaking the\nassumption that all selected items receive equal consideration. One such\ncategory of applications involves the presentation of search results, product\nrecommendations, news articles, and other content, due to the well-documented\nphenomenon that humans pay greater attention to higher-ranked items. As a\nresult, optimization in content presentation for diversity, user coverage,\ncalibration, or other objectives more accurately represents a sequence\nselection problem, to which traditional submodularity approximation results no\nlonger apply. Although extensions of submodularity to sequences have been\nproposed, none is designed to model settings where items contribute based on\ntheir position in a ranked list, and hence they are not able to express these\ntypes of optimization problems. In this paper, we aim to address this modeling\ngap.\nHere, we propose a new formalism of ordered submodularity that captures these\nordering problems in content presentation, and more generally a category of\noptimization problems over ranked sequences in which different list positions\ncontribute differently to the objective function. We analyze the natural\nordered analogue of the greedy algorithm and show that it provides a\n$2$-approximation. We also show that this bound is tight, establishing that our\nnew framework is conceptually and quantitatively distinct from previous\nformalisms of set and sequence submodularity.",

Prior research has suggested that lonely\nindividuals are more likely to seek mental health help from an online social\nplatform (e.g., Reddit), a perceived comfortable environment for lonely people\nto seek mental health support through anonymous communication with a broad\nsocial network (Andy, 2021; Bonetti et al., 2010; Morahan-Martin et al., 2003).\nTherefore, this study aims to identify and analyze depression-related dialogues\non loneliness subreddits during the COVID-19 outbreak, with the impact on\ndepression-related infoveillance during the pandemic. With the collected data\nusing Reddit API, our study utilized logistic regression and topic modeling to\nclassify and examine depression related discussions on loneliness subreddits\nduring the outbreak. Our results reveal that lonely individuals engaging in\ndepression-related discussions are likely to be experiencing elevated risks of\nmental health problems and domestic issues, higher level of relationship\nseeking, and heightened need of social support. Furthermore, the results\nsuggest an increase in dog adoption as a coping behavior and challenges in the\nonline learning environment. Finally, returning users disclose and seek\ninformation on triggering factors of mental health problems, indicating the\nsignificance of peer-to-peer mental health support on loneliness subreddits.\nOur future work will clinically validate the current approach, which has\nimplications on designing surveillance system during the crisis.",

    "abstract": "In Azure, up to 25% of memory is stranded, i.e., it is leftover after the\nservers' cores have been rented to VMs. Memory disaggregation promises to\nreduce this stranding. However, making disaggregation practical for production\ncloud deployment remains challenging. For example, RDMA-based disaggregation\ninvolves too much overhead for common workloads and transparent latency\nmanagement is incompatible with virtualization acceleration. The emerging\nCompute Express Link (CXL) standard offers a low-overhead substrate to build\nmemory disaggregation while overcoming these challenges. This paper proposes a\nfirst-generation CXL-based disaggregation system that meets the requirements of\ncloud providers. Our system includes a memory pool controller, and\nprediction-based system software and distributed control plane designs. Its\npredictions of VM latency sensitivity and memory usage allow it to split\nworkloads across local and pooled memory while mitigating the higher pool\nlatency.\nOur analysis of production clusters shows that small pools of 8-32 sockets\nare sufficient to reduce stranding significantly. It also shows that about 50%\nof all VMs never touch 50% of their rented memory. In emulated experiments with\n150+ workloads, we show our pooling approach incurs a configurable performance\nloss between 1-5%. Finally, we show that disaggregation can achieve a 9-10%\nreduction in overall DRAM, which represents hundreds of millions of dollars in\ncost savings for a large cloud provider.",

    "title": "Improving Time Sensitivity for Question Answering over Temporal  Knowledge Graphs",
    "abstract": "Question answering over temporal knowledge graphs (KGs) efficiently uses\nfacts contained in a temporal KG, which records entity relations and when they\noccur in time, to answer natural language questions (e.g., \"Who was the\npresident of the US before Obama?\"). These questions often involve three\ntime-related challenges that previous work fail to adequately address: 1)\nquestions often do not specify exact timestamps of interest (e.g., \"Obama\"\ninstead of 2000); 2) subtle lexical differences in time relations (e.g.,\n\"before\" vs \"after\"); 3) off-the-shelf temporal KG embeddings that previous\nwork builds on ignore the temporal order of timestamps, which is crucial for\nanswering temporal-order related questions. In this paper, we propose a\ntime-sensitive question answering (TSQA) framework to tackle these problems.\nTSQA features a timestamp estimation module to infer the unwritten timestamp\nfrom the question. We also employ a time-sensitive KG encoder to inject\nordering information into the temporal KG embeddings that TSQA is based on.\nWith the help of techniques to reduce the search space for potential answers,\nTSQA significantly outperforms the previous state of the art on a new benchmark\nfor question answering over temporal KGs, especially achieving a 32% (absolute)\nerror reduction on complex questions that require multiple steps of reasoning\nover facts in the temporal KG.",

    "title": "Sentiment Word Aware Multimodal Refinement for Multimodal Sentiment  Analysis with ASR Errors",
    "abstract": "Multimodal sentiment analysis has attracted increasing attention and lots of\nmodels have been proposed. However, the performance of the state-of-the-art\nmodels decreases sharply when they are deployed in the real world. We find that\nthe main reason is that real-world applications can only access the text\noutputs by the automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, which may be with\nerrors because of the limitation of model capacity. Through further analysis of\nthe ASR outputs, we find that in some cases the sentiment words, the key\nsentiment elements in the textual modality, are recognized as other words,\nwhich makes the sentiment of the text change and hurts the performance of\nmultimodal sentiment models directly. To address this problem, we propose the\nsentiment word aware multimodal refinement model (SWRM), which can dynamically\nrefine the erroneous sentiment words by leveraging multimodal sentiment clues.\nSpecifically, we first use the sentiment word position detection module to\nobtain the most possible position of the sentiment word in the text and then\nutilize the multimodal sentiment word refinement module to dynamically refine\nthe sentiment word embeddings. The refined embeddings are taken as the textual\ninputs of the multimodal feature fusion module to predict the sentiment labels.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on the real-world datasets including\nMOSI-Speechbrain, MOSI-IBM, and MOSI-iFlytek and the results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our model, which surpasses the current state-of-the-art models\non three datasets. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted for other\nmultimodal feature fusion models easily. Data and code are available at\nhttps://github.com/albertwy/SWRM.",

We propose basis composition learning on single image filters to\nautomatically determine their optimal formulas. The feasibility is based on a\ntwo-step strategy: first, we build a set of filtered basis (FB) consisting of\napproximations under selected parameter configurations; second, a dual-branch\ncomposition module is proposed to learn how the candidates in FB are combined\nto better approximate the target image. Our method is simple yet effective in\npractice; it renders filters to be user-friendly and benefits fundamental\nlow-level vision problems including denoising, deraining and texture removal.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an appropriate\nbalance among the performance, time complexity and memory efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Owing to the fluctuant renewable generation and power demand, the energy\nsurplus or deficit in each nanogrid is embodied differently across time. To\nstimulate local renewable energy consumption and minimize the long-term energy\ncost, some issues still remain to be explored: when and how the energy demand\nand bidirectional trading prices are scheduled considering personal comfort\npreferences and environmental factors. For this purpose, the demand response\nand two-way pricing problems concurrently for nanogrids and a public monitoring\nentity (PME) are studied with exploiting the large potential thermal elastic\nability of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) units. Different\nfrom nanogrids, in terms of minimizing time-average costs, PME aims to set\nreasonable prices and optimize profits by trading with nanogrids and the main\ngrid bi-directionally. In particular, such bilevel energy management problem is\nformulated as a stochastic form in a long-term horizon. Since there are\nuncertain system parameters, time-coupled queue constraints and the interplay\nof bilevel decision-making, it is challenging to solve the formulated problems.\nTo this end, we derive a form of relaxation based on Lyapunov optimization\ntechnique to make the energy management problem tractable without forecasting\nthe related system parameters. The transaction between nanogrids and PME is\ncaptured by a one-leader and multi-follower Stackelberg game framework. Then,\ntheoretical analysis of the existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg equilibrium\n(SE) is developed based on the proposed game property.

Recursive\nTransformer based on Differentiable Trees (R2D2) makes it possible to scale to\nlarge language model pre-training even with complex tree encoder by introducing\na heuristic pruning method. However, the rule-based pruning approach suffers\nfrom local optimum and slow inference issues. In this paper, we fix those\nissues in a unified method. We propose to use a top-down parser as a\nmodel-based pruning method, which also enables parallel encoding during\ninference. Typically, our parser casts parsing as a split point scoring task,\nwhich first scores all split points for a given sentence, and then recursively\nsplits a span into two by picking a split point with the highest score in the\ncurrent span. The reverse order of the splits is considered as the order of\npruning in R2D2 encoder. Beside the bi-directional language model loss, we also\noptimize the parser by minimizing the KL distance between tree probabilities\nfrom parser and R2D2. Our experiments show that our Fast-R2D2 improves\nperformance significantly in grammar induction and achieves competitive results\nin downstream classification tasks.",

For the Chinese language, however,\nthere is no subword because each token is an atomic character. The meaning of a\nword in Chinese is different in that a word is a compositional unit consisting\nof multiple characters. Such difference motivates us to investigate whether WWM\nleads to better context understanding ability for Chinese BERT. To achieve\nthis, we introduce two probing tasks related to grammatical error correction\nand ask pretrained models to revise or insert tokens in a masked language\nmodeling manner. We construct a dataset including labels for 19,075 tokens in\n10,448 sentences. We train three Chinese BERT models with standard\ncharacter-level masking (CLM), WWM, and a combination of CLM and WWM,\nrespectively. Our major findings are as follows: First, when one character\nneeds to be inserted or replaced, the model trained with CLM performs the best.\nSecond, when more than one character needs to be handled, WWM is the key to\nbetter performance.

In this work, for the first time, we study\nadversarial samples that can fool state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning based\n6D pose estimation models. In particular, we propose a Unified 6D pose\nestimation Attack, namely U6DA, which can successfully attack all the three\nmain categories of models for 6D pose estimation.

Specifically, we explore a\ntransfer-based black-box attack to 6D pose estimation. By shifting the\nsegmentation attention map away from its original position, adversarial samples\nare crafted. We show that such adversarial samples are not only effective for\nthe direct 6D pose estimation models, but also able to attack the two-stage\nbased models regardless of their robust RANSAC modules. Extensive experiments\nwere conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our U6DA with large-scale\npublic benchmarks.

Traditional depression diagnostics commonly depends on\nrating with scales, which can be labor-intensive and subjective. In this\ncontext, Automatic Depression Detection (ADD) has been attracting more\nattention for its low cost and objectivity. ADD systems are able to detect\ndepression automatically from some medical records, like video sequences.\nHowever, it remains challenging to effectively extract depression-specific\ninformation from long sequences, thereby hindering a satisfying accuracy. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel ADD method via learning and fusing features from\nvisual cues. Specifically, we firstly construct Temporal Dilated Convolutional\nNetwork (TDCN), in which multiple Dilated Convolution Blocks (DCB) are designed\nand stacked, to learn the long-range temporal information from sequences. Then,\nthe Feature-Wise Attention (FWA) module is adopted to fuse different features\nextracted from TDCNs. The module learns to assign weights for the feature\nchannels, aiming to better incorporate different kinds of visual features and\nfurther enhance the detection accuracy.

To this end, we\npresent Temporal Perceiver, a general architecture with Transformers, offering\na unified solution to the detection of arbitrary generic boundaries. The core\ndesign is to introduce a small set of latent feature queries as anchors to\ncompress the redundant input into fixed dimension via cross-attention blocks.\nThanks to this fixed number of latent units, it reduces the quadratic\ncomplexity of attention operation to a linear form of input frames.\nSpecifically, to leverage the coherence structure of videos, we construct two\ntypes of latent feature queries: boundary queries and context queries, which\nhandle the semantic incoherence and coherence regions accordingly. Moreover, to\nguide the learning of latent feature queries, we propose an alignment loss on\ncross-attention to explicitly encourage the boundary queries to attend on the\ntop possible boundaries. Finally, we present a sparse detection head on the\ncompressed representations and directly output the final boundary detection\nresults without any post-processing module.

    "title": "Towards IID representation learning and its application on biomedical  data",
    "abstract": "Due to the heterogeneity of real-world data, the widely accepted independent\nand identically distributed (IID) assumption has been criticized in recent\nstudies on causality. In this paper, we argue that instead of being a\nquestionable assumption, IID is a fundamental task-relevant property that needs\nto be learned. Consider $k$ independent random vectors $\\mathsf{X}^{i = 1,\n\\ldots, k}$, we elaborate on how a variety of different causal questions can be\nreformulated to learning a task-relevant function $\\phi$ that induces IID among\n$\\mathsf{Z}^i := \\phi \\circ \\mathsf{X}^i$, which we term IID representation\nlearning.\nFor proof of concept, we examine the IID representation learning on\nOut-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization tasks. Concretely, by utilizing the\nrepresentation obtained via the learned function that induces IID, we conduct\nprediction of molecular characteristics (molecular prediction) on two\nbiomedical datasets with real-world distribution shifts introduced by a)\npreanalytical variation and b) sampling protocol. To enable reproducibility and\nfor comparison to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, this is done by\nfollowing the OOD benchmarking guidelines recommended from WILDS. Compared to\nthe SOTA baselines supported in WILDS, the results confirm the superior\nperformance of IID representation learning on OOD tasks.

    "abstract": "The development of mobile robot platforms for inspection has gained traction\nin recent years with the rapid advancement in hardware and software. However,\nconventional mobile robots are unable to address the challenge of operating in\nextreme environments where the robot is required to traverse narrow gaps in\nhighly cluttered areas with restricted access. This paper presents MIRRAX, a\nrobot that has been designed to meet these challenges with the capability of\nre-configuring itself to both access restricted environments through narrow\nports and navigate through tightly spaced obstacles. Controllers for the robot\nare detailed, along with an analysis on the controllability of the robot given\nthe use of Mecanum wheels in a variable configuration. Characterisation on the\nrobot's performance identified suitable configurations for operating in narrow\nenvironments. The minimum lateral footprint width achievable for stable\nconfiguration ($<2^\\text{o}$~roll) was 0.19~m. Experimental validation of the\nrobot's controllability shows good agreement with the theoretical analysis. A\nfurther series of experiments shows the feasibility of the robot in addressing\nthe challenges above: the capability to reconfigure itself for restricted entry\nthrough ports as small as 150mm diameter, and navigating through cluttered\nenvironments. The paper also presents results from a deployment in a Magnox\nfacility at the Sellafield nuclear site in the UK -- the first robot to ever do\nso, for remote inspection and mapping.",

For an efficient servicing of VR users,\nan efficient THz channel allocation solution becomes a necessity. Assuming that\nRIS component is the most critical one in enabling the service, we investigate\nthe impact of RIS hardware failure on channel allocation performance.

The SMDP-based model of the RIS system is formulated by defining\nthe state space, action space, reward model, and transition probability\ndistribution. We propose an optimal iterative algorithm for channel allocation\nthat decides the next action at each system state.

Considering that the performance of a neural network is\nclosely related to the size of the dataset, the lack of data limits the\nperformance improvement of the automated essay scoring model. In this paper, we\nproposed a method to increase the number of essay-score pairs using\nback-translation and score adjustment and applied it to the Automated Student\nAssessment Prize dataset for augmentation. We evaluated the effectiveness of\nthe augmented data using models from prior work.

Moreover, for a\nclass of population games with two actions and symmetric rewards a Lyapunov\nargument is employed to establish an evolutionary folk theorem that guarantees\nconvergence to the evolutionary stable states of the game. Numerical\nsimulations are provided to illustrate and corroborate our findings.",

Using these user groups, we\nevaluate four collaborative filtering-based algorithms with respect to\npopularity bias on the item and the user level. Our findings are three-fold:\nfirstly, we show that users with little interest into popular items tend to\nhave large user profiles and thus, are important data sources for multimedia\nrecommender systems.

In such situations, the preferences of\nexperts need to be taken into account.\nIn this paper, we introduce a data-efficient grasping pipeline (Latent Space\nGP Selector -- LGPS) that learns grasp preferences with only a few labels per\nobject (typically 1 to 4) and generalizes to new views of this object. Our\npipeline is based on learning a latent space of grasps with a dataset generated\nwith any state-of-the-art grasp generator (e.g., Dex-Net). This latent space is\nthen used as a low-dimensional input for a Gaussian process classifier that\nselects the preferred grasp among those proposed by the generator.\nThe results show that our method outperforms both GR-ConvNet and GG-CNN (two\nstate-of-the-art methods that are also based on labeled grasps) on the Cornell\ndataset, especially when only a few labels are used: only 80 labels are enough\nto correctly choose 80% of the grasps (885 scenes, 244 objects).

In this paper, we propose a self-supervised scheme named\nas CLIP-GEN for general text-to-image generation with the language-image priors\nextracted with a pre-trained CLIP model. In our approach, we only require a set\nof unlabeled images in the general domain to train a text-to-image generator.\nSpecifically, given an image without text labels, we first extract the\nembedding of the image in the united language-vision embedding space with the\nimage encoder of CLIP. Next, we convert the image into a sequence of discrete\ntokens in the VQGAN codebook space (the VQGAN model can be trained with the\nunlabeled image dataset in hand). Finally, we train an autoregressive\ntransformer that maps the image tokens from its unified language-vision\nrepresentation. Once trained, the transformer can generate coherent image\ntokens based on the text embedding extracted from the text encoder of CLIP upon\nan input text. Such a strategy enables us to train a strong and general\ntext-to-image generator with large text-free image dataset such as ImageNet.\nQualitative and quantitative evaluations verify that our method significantly\noutperforms optimization-based text-to-image methods in terms of image quality\nwhile not compromising the text-image matching.

Protection of data has\nproven to be essential, especially due to increased home Internet traffic\nduring the COVID pandemic. Citizens do not possess their own travel documents.\nThe European Commission aims to transition this governmental property towards\nself-sovereign identity, introducing many new opportunities. Citizens are\nlocked into banks with non-portable IBAN accounts and unsustainable legacy\nbanking infrastructures. Migration to all-digital low-fraud infrastructures and\nhealthier competitive ecosystems is essential. The overall challenge is to\nreturn the power to citizens and users again.

Although disentangling and understanding the correlations among\nspatial, temporal, and graph aspects have been a long-standing key topic in\nnetwork science, they typically rely on network processing hypothesized by\nhuman knowledge.

    "abstract": "Designing molecules with specific properties is a long-lasting research\nproblem and is central to advancing crucial domains such as drug discovery and\nmaterial science. Recent advances in deep graph generative models treat\nmolecule design as graph generation problems which provide new opportunities\ntoward the breakthrough of this long-lasting problem. Existing models, however,\nhave many shortcomings, including poor interpretability and controllability\ntoward desired molecular properties. This paper focuses on new methodologies\nfor molecule generation with interpretable and controllable deep generative\nmodels, by proposing new monotonically-regularized graph variational\nautoencoders. The proposed models learn to represent the molecules with latent\nvariables and then learn the correspondence between them and molecule\nproperties parameterized by polynomial functions. To further improve the\nintepretability and controllability of molecule generation towards desired\nproperties, we derive new objectives which further enforce monotonicity of the\nrelation between some latent variables and target molecule properties such as\ntoxicity and clogP. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the\nsuperiority of the proposed framework on accuracy, novelty, disentanglement,\nand control towards desired molecular properties.

    "abstract": "With the prevailing of mobility as a service (MaaS), it becomes increasingly\nimportant to manage multi-traffic modes simultaneously and cooperatively. As an\nimportant component of MaaS, short-term passenger flow prediction for\nmulti-traffic modes has thus been brought into focus. It is a challenging\nproblem because the spatiotemporal features of multi-traffic modes are\ncritically complex. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a multi-task\nlearning-based model, called Res-Transformer, for short-term passenger flow\nprediction of multi-traffic modes (subway, taxi, and bus). Each traffic mode is\ntreated as a single task in the model. The Res-Transformer consists of three\nparts: (1) several modified transformer layers comprising 2D convolutional\nneural networks (CNN) and multi-head attention mechanism, which helps to\nextract the spatial and temporal features of multi-traffic modes, (2) a\nresidual network architecture used to extract the inner pattern of different\ntraffic modes and enhance the passenger flow features of multi-traffic modes.\nThe Res-Transformer model is evaluated on two large-scale real-world datasets\nfrom Beijing, China. One is the region of a traffic hub and the other is the\nregion of a residential area. Experiments are conducted to compare the\nperformance of the proposed model with several state-of-the-art models to prove\nthe effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. This paper can give\ncritical insights into the short-tern passenger flow prediction for\nmulti-traffic modes.",

    "abstract": "The impact of the environment on graphene's properties such as strain, charge\ndensity, and dielectric environment can be evaluated by Raman spectroscopy.\nThese environmental interactions are not trivial to determine, since they\naffect the spectra in overlapping ways. Data preprocessing such as background\nsubtraction and peak fitting is typically used. Moreover, collected\nspectroscopic data vary due to different experimental setups and environments.\nSuch variations, artifacts, and environmental differences pose a challenge in\naccurate spectral analysis. In this work, we developed a deep learning model to\novercome the effects of such variations and classify graphene Raman spectra\naccording to different charge densities and dielectric environments. We\nconsider two approaches: deep learning models and machine learning algorithms\nto classify spectra with slightly different charge density or dielectric\nenvironment. These two approaches show similar success rates for high\nSignal-to-Noise data. However, deep learning models are less sensitive to\nnoise. To improve the accuracy and generalization of all models, we use data\naugmentation through additive noise and peak shifting. We demonstrated the\nspectra classification with 99% accuracy using a convolutional neural net (CNN)\nmodel. The CNN model is able to classify Raman spectra of graphene with\ndifferent charge doping levels and even subtle variation in the spectra between\ngraphene on SiO$_2$ and graphene on silanized SiO$_2$.

However, it is found that the unsupervised\nlearning of fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) is more challenging than\nGOC and person re-ID. In order to bridge the gap between unsupervised and\nsupervised learning for FGVC, we investigate the essential factors (including\nfeature extraction, clustering, and contrastive learning) for the performance\ngap between supervised and unsupervised FGVC. Furthermore, we propose a simple,\neffective, and practical method, termed as UFCL, to alleviate the gap. Three\nkey issues are concerned and improved: First, we introduce a robust and\npowerful backbone, ResNet50-IBN, which has an ability of domain adaptation when\nwe transfer ImageNet pre-trained models to FGVC tasks. Next, we propose to\nintroduce HDBSCAN instead of DBSCAN to do clustering, which can generate better\nclusters for adjacent categories with fewer hyper-parameters. Finally, we\npropose a weighted feature agent and its updating mechanism to do contrastive\nlearning by using the pseudo labels with inevitable noise, which can improve\nthe optimization process of learning the parameters of the network.

    "abstract": "Among the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed within the\n2030 Agenda and adopted by all the United Nations member states, the Fifth SDG\nis a call for action to turn Gender Equality into a fundamental human right and\nan essential foundation for a better world. It includes the eradication of all\ntypes of violence against women. Within this context, the UC3M4Safety research\nteam aims to develop Bindi. This is a cyber-physical system which includes\nembedded Artificial Intelligence algorithms, for user real-time monitoring\ntowards the detection of affective states, with the ultimate goal of achieving\nthe early detection of risk situations for women. On this basis, we make use of\nwearable affective computing including smart sensors, data encryption for\nsecure and accurate collection of presumed crime evidence, as well as the\nremote connection to protecting agents. Towards the development of such system,\nthe recordings of different laboratory and into-the-wild datasets are in\nprocess. These are contained within the UC3M4Safety Database. Thus, this paper\npresents and details the first release of WEMAC, a novel multi-modal dataset,\nwhich comprises a laboratory-based experiment for 47 women volunteers that were\nexposed to validated audio-visual stimuli to induce real emotions by using a\nvirtual reality headset while physiological, speech signals and self-reports\nwere acquired and collected. We believe this dataset will serve and assist\nresearch on multi-modal affective computing using physiological and speech\ninformation.",

BP algorithms make use of factor\ngraph representations, whose assignment to the problem of interest is not\nunique.

Whenever small and abundant loops in factor graphs are\nsystematically generated by constraints between variables in the original\nnetwork, our factor-graph assignment in BP complements other approaches.

In\nthis paper, we propose a decoupling-style multi-band fusion model to perform\nfull-band speech denoising and dereverberation. Instead of optimizing the\nfull-band speech by a single network structure, we decompose the full-band\ntarget into multi sub bands and then employ a multi-stage chain optimization\nstrategy to estimate clean spectrum stage by stage. Specifically, the low- (0-8\nkHz), middle- (8-16 kHz), and high-frequency (16-24 kHz) regions are mapped by\nthree separate sub-networks and are then fused to obtain the full-band clean\ntarget STFT spectrum.

What data extracted from software repositories\ncannot tell us, however, is how developers perceive flakiness: How prevalent is\ntest flakiness in developers' daily routine, how does it affect them, and most\nimportantly: What do they want us researchers to do about it? To answer these\nquestions, we surveyed 335 professional software developers and testers in\ndifferent domains. The survey respondents confirm that flaky tests are a common\nand serious problem, thus reinforcing ongoing research on flaky test detection.\nDevelopers are less worried about the computational costs caused by re-running\ntests and more about the loss of trust in the test outcomes. Therefore, they\nwould like to have IDE plugins to detect flaky code as well as better\nvisualizations of the problem, particularly dashboards showing test outcomes\nover time; they also wish for more training and information on flakiness.

However, predicting the future population is a\nchallenging task due to its complex spatiotemporal dependencies.

However, CNN merely\ncaptures spatial correlations by using a rectangle filter; it ignores urban\nenvironmental information such as distribution of railroads and location of\nPOI. Moreover, the importance of those kinds of information for population\nprediction differs in each region and is affected by contextual situations such\nas weather conditions and day of the week. To tackle this problem, we propose a\nnovel deep learning model called Attention-based Contextual Multi-View Graph\nConvolutional Networks (ACMV-GCNs).

    "abstract": "The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic prohibited radically the collocation\nand face-to-face interactions of participants in coding bootcamps and similar\nexperiences, which are key characteristics that help participants to advance\ntechnical work. Several specific issues are faced and need to be solved when\nrunning online coding camps, which can achieve the same level of positive\noutcomes for participants. One of such issues is how to keep the same level of\nfun that participants obtained through physical activities and interactions in\nthe face-to-face settings. In this paper, we report on our experience and\ninsights gained from designing and running a fully remote coding camp that\nexposes high school students to Agile-based Software Engineering practices to\nenhance their ability to develop high-quality software. To design the online\ncoding camp, we adapted the face-to-face version of the coding camp to keep the\nsame \"level of fun\", i.e., adaptations aimed at increasing communication,\nengaging participants, and introducing fun items to reduce fatigue due to\nprolonged computer use, while preserving the technical curriculum that enables\nstudents to attain the learning goals originally planned. The comparison with\nthe results of the face-to-face coding camp shows that we succeeded in keeping\nthe fun alive in the online edition, and the participants of online camp were\nable to produce the results at the same level of quality in terms of product\nand process as in the face-to-face edition. From our experience, we synthesize\nlessons learned, and we sketch some guidelines for educators.",

The CQFP\nsubproblem about optimizing the reflecting coefficients can be solved by the\ndomain and envelope shrinking algorithm (DES), providing the best SE\nperformance. Besides, a low-complexity method of gradient-based linearization\nwith domain (GLD) is proposed for obtaining a sub-optimal reflecting\ncoefficients for fast deployment. Considering the power consumption in the\npractical application of RIS-aided SSS, the EE performance of our proposed GLD\nmethod has significant gain over that of the SSS without RIS.

    "abstract": "Deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have been employed widely in\ncomputational creativity research. However, such models discourage\nout-of-distribution generation to avoid spurious sample generation, thereby\nlimiting their creativity. Thus, incorporating research on human creativity\ninto generative deep learning techniques presents an opportunity to make their\noutputs more compelling and human-like. As we see the emergence of generative\nmodels directed toward creativity research, a need for machine learning-based\nsurrogate metrics to characterize creative output from these models is\nimperative. We propose group-based subset scanning to identify, quantify, and\ncharacterize creative processes by detecting a subset of anomalous\nnode-activations in the hidden layers of the generative models. Our experiments\non the standard image benchmarks, and their \"creatively generated\" variants,\nreveal that the proposed subset scores distribution is more useful for\ndetecting creative processes in the activation space rather than the pixel\nspace. Further, we found that creative samples generate larger subsets of\nanomalies than normal or non-creative samples across datasets. The node\nactivations highlighted during the creative decoding process are different from\nthose responsible for the normal sample generation. Lastly, we assess if the\nimages from the subsets selected by our method were also found creative by\nhuman evaluators, presenting a link between creativity perception in humans and\nnode activations within deep neural nets.",

Recently, genetic programming (GP) has been used to evolve\ninterpretable DR mappings in the form of symbolic expressions. There exists a\nnumber of ways in which GP can be used to this end and no study exists that\nperforms a comparison.

With the surgence of deep learning and large-scale\npre-training techniques, various neural information retrieval models are\nproposed and they have demonstrated the power for improving search (especially,\nthe ranking) quality. All these existing search methods follow a common\nparadigm, i.e. index-retrieve-rerank, where they first build an index of all\ndocuments based on document terms (i.e., sparse inverted index) or\nrepresentation vectors (i.e., dense vector index), then retrieve and rerank\nretrieved documents based on similarity between the query and documents via\nranking models. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm of information\nretrieval with neither sparse nor dense index but only a model. Specifically,\nwe propose a pre-training model-based IR system called DynamicRetriever. As for\nthis system, the training stage embeds the token-level and document-level\ninformation (especially, document identifiers) of the corpus into the model\nparameters, then the inference stage directly generates document identifiers\nfor a given query. Compared with existing search methods, the model-based IR\nsystem has two advantages: i) it parameterizes the traditional static index\nwith a pre-training model, which converts the document semantic mapping into a\ndynamic and updatable process; ii) with separate document identifiers, it\ncaptures both the term-level and document-level information for each document.\nExtensive experiments conducted on the public search benchmark MS MARCO verify\nthe effectiveness and potential of our proposed new paradigm for information\nretrieval.",

It has been instrumental in increasing\nthe number of admissions for disadvantaged students at specialized high\nschools. However, our empirical analysis of the student-school matches shows\nthat about 950 in-group blocking pairs were created each year amongst the\ndisadvantaged group of students, impacting about 650 disadvantaged students.\nMoreover, we find that this program usually benefits lower-performing\ndisadvantaged students more than the top-performing ones, thus unintentionally\ncreating an incentive to under-perform.\nIn this work, we explore two affirmative action policies that can be used to\nminimally modify and improve the discovery program: minority reserve (MR) and\njoint-seat allocation (JSA). We show that (i) both MR and JSA result in no\nin-group blocking pairs, and (ii) JSA is weakly group strategy-proof, ensures\nthat at least one disadvantaged is not worse off, and when reservation quotas\nare carefully chosen then no disadvantaged student is worse-off. In the general\nsetting, we show that there is no clear winner in terms of the matchings\nprovided by DISC, JSA and MR, from the perspective of disadvantaged students.\nWe however characterize a condition for markets, that we term high\ncompetitiveness, where JSA dominates MR for disadvantaged students.

Search engines, social networks, content delivery and retail and\ne-commerce sites belong to this group of applications. An important element in\nthe architecture of data centers where these applications run is the\ncommunication infrastructure, commonly known as data center networks (DCNs). A\ncritical challenge DCNs have to address is the processing of the traffic of\ncloud applications, which due to its properties is essentially different to the\ntraffic of other Internet applications. In order to improve the responsiveness\nand throughput of applications, DCNs should be able to prioritize short flows\n(a few KB) over long flows (several MB). However, given the time and space\nvariations the traffic presents, the information about flow sizes is not\navailable in advance in order to plan the flow scheduling. In this paper, we\npresent an adaptable mechanism called Adaptable Workload-Agnostic Flow\nScheduling (AWAFS). It is an adaptable approach that can adjust in an agnostic\nway the scheduling configuration of DCN forwarding devices. This agnostic\nadjustment contributes to reduce the Flow Completion Time (FCT) of those short\nflows, representing around 85% of the traffic handled by cloud applications.\nOur evaluation results based on simulation show that AWAFS can reduce the\naverage FCT of short flows between 16.9% and 45.2% when compared to the best\nexisting agnostic non-adaptable solution, without inducing starvation on long\nflows. Indeed, it can provide improvements as high as 39% for long flows.\nAdditionally, AWAFS can improve the FCT for short flows in scenarios with high\nheterogeneity in the traffic present in the network, with a reduction up to 5%\nfor the average FCT and 15% for the tail FCT.",

    "abstract": "Despite superior performance in many situations, deep neural networks are\noften vulnerable to adversarial examples and distribution shifts, limiting\nmodel generalization ability in real-world applications. To alleviate these\nproblems, recent approaches leverage distributional robustness optimization\n(DRO) to find the most challenging distribution, and then minimize loss\nfunction over this most challenging distribution. Regardless of achieving some\nimprovements, these DRO approaches have some obvious limitations. First, they\npurely focus on local regularization to strengthen model robustness, missing a\nglobal regularization effect which is useful in many real-world applications\n(e.g., domain adaptation, domain generalization, and adversarial machine\nlearning). Second, the loss functions in the existing DRO approaches operate in\nonly the most challenging distribution, hence decouple with the original\ndistribution, leading to a restrictive modeling capability. In this paper, we\npropose a novel regularization technique, following the veins of\nWasserstein-based DRO framework. Specifically, we define a particular joint\ndistribution and Wasserstein-based uncertainty, allowing us to couple the\noriginal and most challenging distributions for enhancing modeling capability\nand applying both local and global regularizations. Empirical studies on\ndifferent learning problems demonstrate that our proposed approach\nsignificantly outperforms the existing regularization approaches in various\ndomains: semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation, domain generalization,\nand adversarial machine learning.",

In this work, we postulate that similar regularities can be found in\nother cognitive processes, such as those involving language production. In\norder to investigate this claim, we analyse a dataset containing tweets of a\nheterogeneous group of Twitter users (regular users and professional writers).\nLeveraging a methodology similar to the one used to uncover the\nwell-established social cognitive constraints, we find regularities at both the\nstructural and semantic level. At the former, we find that a concentric layered\nstructure (which we call ego network of words, in analogy to the ego network of\nsocial relationships) very well captures how individuals organise the words\nthey use. The size of the layers in this structure regularly grows\n(approximately 2-3 times with respect to the previous one) when moving\noutwards, and the two penultimate external layers consistently account for\napproximately 60% and 30% of the used words, irrespective of the number of the\ntotal number of layers of the user. For the semantic analysis, each ring of\neach ego network is described by a semantic profile, which captures the topics\nassociated with the words in the ring.

Viewpoint and appearance changes, such as due to weather and\nseasonal variations, make this task challenging. Currently, there is no\nuniversal VPR technique that can work in all types of environments, on a\nvariety of robotic platforms, and under a wide range of viewpoint and\nappearance changes. Recent work has shown the potential of combining different\nVPR methods intelligently by evaluating complementarity for some specific VPR\ndatasets to achieve better performance. This, however, requires ground truth\ninformation (correct matches) which is not available when a robot is deployed\nin a real-world scenario. Moreover, running multiple VPR techniques in parallel\nmay be prohibitive for resource-constrained embedded platforms. To overcome\nthese limitations, this paper presents a probabilistic complementarity based\nswitching VPR system, SwitchHit. Our proposed system consists of multiple VPR\ntechniques, however, it does not simply run all techniques at once, rather\npredicts the probability of correct match for an incoming query image and\ndynamically switches to another complementary technique if the probability of\ncorrectly matching the query is below a certain threshold. This innovative use\nof multiple VPR techniques allow our system to be more efficient and robust\nthan other combined VPR approaches employing brute force and running multiple\nVPR techniques at once. Thus making it more suitable for resource constrained\nembedded systems and achieving an overall superior performance from what any\nindividual VPR method in the system could have by achieved running\nindependently.",

Digital contact tracing has been\nproposed as an automated solution to scale up traditional contact tracing.\nHowever, the required penetration of contact tracing apps within a population\nto achieve a desired target in the control of the epidemic is currently under\ndiscussion within the research community. In order to understand the effects of\ndigital contact tracing, several mathematical models have been proposed. In\nthis article, we survey the main ones and we propose a compartmental SEIR model\nwith which it is possible, differently from the models in the related\nliterature, to derive closed-form conditions regarding the control of the\nepidemic as a function of the contact tracing apps penetration and the testing\nefficiency. Closed-form conditions are crucial for the understandability of\nmodels, and thus for decision makers (including digital contact tracing\ndesigners) to correctly assess the dependencies within the epidemic. With our\nmodel, we find that digital contact tracing alone can rarely tame an epidemic:\nfor unrestrained COVID-19, this would require a testing turnaround of around 1\nday and app uptake above 80% of the population, which are very difficult to\nachieve in practice.

Several alternatives based on both global and local\nprojection operators between spline spaces will be proposed. The appeal of the\napproach with respect to similar published methods is twofold: firstly, it\nexhibits high order convergence.

    "abstract": "Transformer language models that are trained on vast amounts of data have\nachieved remarkable success at various NLP benchmarks. Intriguingly, this\nsuccess is achieved by models that lack an explicit modeling of hierarchical\nsyntactic structures, which were hypothesized by decades of linguistic research\nto be necessary for good generalization. This naturally leaves a question: to\nwhat extent can we further improve the performance of Transformer language\nmodels, through an inductive bias that encourages the model to explain the data\nthrough the lens of recursive syntactic compositions? Although the benefits of\nmodeling recursive syntax have been shown at the small data and model scales,\nit remains an open question whether -- and to what extent -- a similar design\nprinciple is still beneficial in the case of powerful Transformer language\nmodels that work well at scale. To answer these questions, we introduce\nTransformer Grammars -- a novel class of Transformer language models that\ncombine: (i) the expressive power, scalability, and strong performance of\nTransformers, and (ii) recursive syntactic compositions, which here are\nimplemented through a special attention mask. We find that Transformer Grammars\noutperform various strong baselines on multiple syntax-sensitive language\nmodeling evaluation metrics, in addition to sentence-level language modeling\nperplexity. Nevertheless, we find that the recursive syntactic composition\nbottleneck harms perplexity on document-level modeling, providing evidence that\na different kind of memory mechanism -- that works independently of syntactic\nstructures -- plays an important role in the processing of long-form text.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the rise of quantum computers, existing public-key cryptosystems\nare expected to be replaced by post-quantum schemes in the next decade in\nbillions of devices. To facilitate the transition, NIST is running a\nstandardization process which is currently in its final Round. Only three\ndigital signature schemes are left in the competition, among which Dilithium\nand Falcon are the ones based on lattices. Classical fault attacks on signature\nschemes make use of pairs of faulty and correct signatures to recover the\nsecret key which only works on deterministic schemes. To counter such attacks,\nDilithium offers a randomized version which makes each signature unique, even\nwhen signing identical messages.\nIn this work, we introduce a novel Signature Correction Attack which not only\napplies to the deterministic version but also to the randomized version of\nDilithium and is effective even on constant-time implementations using AVX2\ninstructions. The Signature Correction Attack exploits the mathematical\nstructure of Dilithium to recover the secret key bits by using faulty\nsignatures and the public-key. It can work for any fault mechanism which can\ninduce single bit-flips. For demonstration, we are using Rowhammer induced\nfaults. Thus, our attack does not require any physical access or special\nprivileges, and hence could be also implemented on shared cloud servers. We\nperform a thorough classical and quantum security analysis of Dilithium and\nsuccessfully recover 1,851 bits out of 3,072 bits of secret key $s_1$ for\nsecurity level 2. The lattice strength against quantum attackers is reduced\nfrom $2^{128}$ to $2^{81}$ while the strength against classical attackers is\nreduced from $2^{141}$ to $2^{89}$. Hence, the Signature Correction Attack may\nbe employed to achieve a practical attack on Dilithium (security level 2) as\nproposed in Round 3 of the NIST post-quantum standardization process.",

    "abstract": "\"A generator is a parser of randomness.\" This perspective on generators for\nrandom data structures is well established as folklore in the programming\nlanguages community, but it has apparently never been formalized, nor have its\nconsequences been deeply explored.\nWe present free generators, which unify parsing and generation using a common\nstructure that makes the relationship between the two concepts precise. Free\ngenerators lead naturally to a proof that a large class of generators can be\nfactored into a parser plus a distribution over choice sequences. Further, free\ngenerators support a notion of derivative, analogous to familiar Brzozowski\nderivatives of formal languages, that allows analysis tools to \"preview\" the\neffect of a particular generator choice. This, in turn, gives rise to a novel\nalgorithm for generating data structures satisfying user-specified\npreconditions.",

    "title": "ONBRA: Rigorous Estimation of the Temporal Betweenness Centrality in  Temporal Networks",
    "abstract": "In network analysis, the betweenness centrality of a node informally captures\nthe fraction of shortest paths visiting that node. The computation of the\nbetweenness centrality measure is a fundamental task in the analysis of modern\nnetworks, enabling the identification of the most central nodes in such\nnetworks. Additionally to being massive, modern networks also contain\ninformation about the time at which their events occur. Such networks are often\ncalled temporal networks. The temporal information makes the study of the\nbetweenness centrality in temporal networks (i.e., temporal betweenness\ncentrality) much more challenging than in static networks (i.e., networks\nwithout temporal information). Moreover, the exact computation of the temporal\nbetweenness centrality is often impractical on even moderately-sized networks,\ngiven its extremely high computational cost. A natural approach to reduce such\ncomputational cost is to obtain high-quality estimates of the exact values of\nthe temporal betweenness centrality. In this work we present ONBRA, the first\nsampling-based approximation algorithm for estimating the temporal betweenness\ncentrality values of the nodes in a temporal network, providing rigorous\nprobabilistic guarantees on the quality of its output. ONBRA is able to compute\nthe estimates of the temporal betweenness centrality values under two different\noptimality criteria for the shortest paths of the temporal network. In\naddition, ONBRA outputs high-quality estimates with sharp theoretical\nguarantees leveraging on the \\emph{empirical Bernstein bound}, an advanced\nconcentration inequality. Finally, our experimental evaluation shows that ONBRA\nsignificantly reduces the computational resources required by the exact\ncomputation of the temporal betweenness centrality on several real world\nnetworks, while reporting high-quality estimates with rigorous guarantees.",

    "abstract": "This paper tackles the task of goal-conditioned dynamic manipulation of\ndeformable objects. This task is highly challenging due to its complex dynamics\n(introduced by object deformation and high-speed action) and strict task\nrequirements (defined by a precise goal specification). To address these\nchallenges, we present Iterative Residual Policy (IRP), a general learning\nframework applicable to repeatable tasks with complex dynamics. IRP learns an\nimplicit policy via residual dynamics -- instead of modeling the entire\ndynamical system and inferring actions from that model, IRP learns residual\ndynamics that predict the effects of delta action on the previously-observed\ntrajectory. When combined with adaptive action sampling, the system can quickly\noptimize its actions online to reach a specified goal. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of IRP on two tasks: whipping a rope to hit a target point and\nswinging a cloth to reach a target pose. Despite being trained only in\nsimulation on a fixed robot setup, IRP is able to efficiently generalize to\nnoisy real-world dynamics, new objects with unseen physical properties, and\neven different robot hardware embodiments, demonstrating its excellent\ngeneralization capability relative to alternative approaches.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the generalization problem of person\nre-identification (re-id), whose major challenge is the distribution shift on\nan unseen domain. As an important tool of regularizing the distribution, batch\nnormalization (BN) has been widely used in existing methods. However, they\nneglect that BN is severely biased to the training domain and inevitably\nsuffers the performance drop if directly generalized without being updated. To\ntackle this issue, we propose Batch Norm Test-time Adaption (BNTA), a novel\nre-id framework that applies the self-supervised strategy to update BN\nparameters adaptively. Specifically, BNTA quickly explores the domain-aware\ninformation within unlabeled target data before inference, and accordingly\nmodulates the feature distribution normalized by BN to adapt to the target\ndomain. This is accomplished by two designed self-supervised auxiliary tasks,\nnamely part positioning and part nearest neighbor matching, which help the\nmodel mine the domain-aware information with respect to the structure and\nidentity of body parts, respectively. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod, we conduct extensive experiments on three re-id datasets and confirm\nthe superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the optimal controller design problem against data\ninjection attacks on actuators for an uncertain control system. We consider\nattacks that aim at maximizing the attack impact while remaining stealthy in\nthe finite horizon. To this end, we use the Conditional Value-at-Risk to\ncharacterize the risk associated with the impact of attacks. The worst-case\nattack impact is characterized using the recently proposed output-to-output\n$\\ell_2$-gain (OOG). We formulate the design problem and observe that it is\nnon-convex and hard to solve. Using the framework of scenario-based\noptimization and a convex proxy for the OOG, we propose a convex optimization\nproblem that approximately solves the design problem with probabilistic\ncertificates. Finally, we illustrate the results through a numerical example.",

To achieve this balance, there exist a\nwide variety of methods. In particular, several methods based on optimization\nmodels have been recently proposed in the causal inference literature. While\nthese optimization-based methods empirically showed an improvement over a\nlimited number of other causal inference methods in their relative ability to\nbalance the distributions of covariates and to estimate causal effects, they\nhave not been thoroughly compared to each other and to other noteworthy causal\ninference methods.

In this work, we study\nthe set-covering location problem when both candidate locations and demand\npoints are continuous sets on a network. This variant has received little\nattention, and the scarce existing approaches have focused on particular cases,\nsuch as tree networks and integer covering radius. Here we study the general\nproblem and present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation (MILP) for\nnetworks with edges' lengths no greater than the covering radius. The model\ndoes not lose generality, as any edge not satisfying this condition can be\npartitioned into subedges of appropriate lengths without changing the problem.\nWe propose a preprocessing algorithm to reduce the size of the MILP, and devise\ntight big-$M$ constants and valid inequalities to strengthen our formulations.\nMoreover, a second MILP is proposed, which admits edges' lengths greater than\nthe covering radius. As opposed to existing formulations of the problem\n(including the first MILP proposed herein), the number of variables and\nconstraints of this second model does not depend on the lengths of the\nnetwork's edges. This second model represents a scalable approach that\nparticularly suits real-world networks, whose edges are usually greater than\nthe covering radius.

The first\none is based on sliding-mode theory and leads to local finite-time convergence\nof the tracking error and rejection of Lipschitz w.r.t. time perturbations. The\nsecond controller is based on LQR control and presents global exponential\nstability of the tracking error and rejection of Lipschitz w.r.t. states\nperturbations. Both controllers generate a continuous control signal,\nattenuating the chattering effect in the case of the sliding-mode algorithms.\nThe developed controllers are tested extensively and compared on the basis of\nnumerical simulations and experiments in the laboratory. The present work opens\nnew perspectives for the application of robust nonlinear control theory to\ncomplex geosystems, earthquakes and sustainable energy production.",

Different from least-squares-based\nalgorithms, such as the adaptive GSP Least Mean Squares (GLMS) algorithm and\nthe normalized GLMS (GNLMS) algorithm, the GNLMP algorithm has the ability to\nreconstruct a graph signal that is corrupted by non-Gaussian noise with\nheavy-tailed characteristics. Compared to the recently introduced adaptive GSP\nleast mean pth power (GLMP) algorithm, the GNLMP algorithm reduces the number\nof iterations to converge to a steady graph signal. The convergence condition\nof the GNLMP algorithm is derived, and the ability of the GNLMP algorithm to\nprocess multidimensional time-varying graph signals with multiple features is\ndemonstrated as well. Simulations show the performance of the GNLMP algorithm\nin estimating steady-state and time-varying graph signals is faster than GLMP\nand more robust in comparison to GLMS and GNLMS.",

    "abstract": "The increasing need of restoring high-resolution Hyper-Spectral (HS) images\nis determining a growing reliance on Computer Vision-based processing to\nenhance the clarity of the image content. HS images can, in fact, suffer from\ndegradation effects or artefacts caused by instrument limitations. This paper\nfocuses on a procedure aimed at reducing the degradation effects,\nfrequency-dependent blur and noise, in Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy\n(THz-TDS) images in reflection geometry. It describes the application of a\njoint deblurring and denoising approach that had been previously proved to be\neffective for the restoration of THz-TDS images in transmission geometry, but\nthat had never been tested in reflection modality. This mode is often the only\none that can be effectively used in most cases, for example when analyzing\nobjects that are either opaque in the THz range, or that cannot be displaced\nfrom their location (e.g., museums), such as those of cultural interest.\nCompared to transmission mode, reflection geometry introduces, however, further\ndistortion to THz data, neglected in existing literature. In this work, we\nsuccessfully implement image deblurring and denoising of both uniform-shape\nsamples (a contemporary 1 Euro cent coin and an inlaid pendant) and samples\nwith the uneven reliefs and corrosion products on the surface which make the\nanalysis of the object particularly complex (an ancient Roman silver coin). The\nstudy demonstrates the ability of image processing to restore data in the 0.25\n- 6 THz range, spanning over more than four octaves, and providing the\nfoundation for future analytical approaches of cultural heritage using the\nfar-infrared spectrum still not sufficiently investigated in literature.",

    "abstract": "An accurate diagnosis and profiling of tumour are critical to the best\ntreatment choices for cancer patients. In addition to the cancer type and its\naggressiveness, molecular heterogeneity also plays a vital role in treatment\nselection. MSI or MMR deficiency is one of the well-studied aberrations in\nterms of molecular changes. Colorectal cancer patients with MMR deficiency\nrespond well to immunotherapy, hence assessment of the relevant molecular\nmarkers can assist clinicians in making optimal treatment selections for\npatients. Immunohistochemistry is one of the ways for identifying these\nmolecular changes which requires additional sections of tumour tissue.\nIntroduction of automated methods that can predict MSI or MMR status from a\ntarget image without the need for additional sections can substantially reduce\nthe cost associated with it. In this work, we present our work on predicting\nMSI status in a two-stage process using a single target slide either stained\nwith CK818 or H\\&E. First, we train a multi-headed convolutional neural network\nmodel where each head is responsible for predicting one of the MMR protein\nexpressions. To this end, we perform registration of MMR slides to the target\nslide as a pre-processing step. In the second stage, statistical features\ncomputed from the MMR prediction maps are used for the final MSI prediction.\nOur results demonstrate that MSI classification can be improved on\nincorporating fine-grained MMR labels in comparison to the previous approaches\nin which coarse labels (MSI/MSS) are utilised.",

Most existing works treat the identification of each landmark as\na single task and typically do not make use of any clinical prior information.\nIn this paper, we present a novel method, named JOINED, for prior guided\nmulti-task learning for joint OD/OC segmentation and fovea detection. An\nauxiliary branch for distance prediction, in addition to a segmentation branch\nand a detection branch, is constructed to effectively utilize the distance\ninformation from each image pixel to landmarks of interest. Our proposed JOINED\npipeline consists of a coarse stage and a fine stage. At the coarse stage, we\nobtain the OD/OC coarse segmentation and the heatmap localization of fovea\nthrough a joint segmentation and detection module. Afterwards, we crop the\nregions of interest for subsequent fine processing and use predictions obtained\nat the coarse stage as additional information for better performance and faster\nconvergence. Experimental results reveal that our proposed JOINED outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art approaches on the publicly-available GAMMA, PALM, and\nREFUGE datasets of fundus images. Furthermore, JOINED ranked the 5th on the\nOD/OC segmentation and fovea detection tasks in the GAMMA challenge hosted by\nthe MICCAI2021 workshop OMIA8.",

The contribution of this work is to show that\nif a linear dynamical system has dimension (McMillan degree) $n$, then there\nalways exist $n$ states from which a stabilizing feedback controller can be\nconstructed, independent of the dimension of the representation of the observed\nstates and the number of inputs.

Our proposed\ntechnique achieved the best results of weighted F1-score of 99.1\\% and 74.7\\%\nfor seizure-wise and patient-wise classification respectively, thereby setting\nnew benchmark results for this dataset.",

    "abstract": "With the development of deep learning-based methods, automated classification\nof electrocardiograms (ECGs) has recently gained much attention. Although the\neffectiveness of deep neural networks has been encouraging, the lack of\ninformation given by the outputs restricts clinicians' reexamination. If the\nuncertainty estimation comes along with the classification results,\ncardiologists can pay more attention to \"uncertain\" cases. Our study aims to\nclassify ECGs with rejection based on data uncertainty and model uncertainty.\nWe perform experiments on a real-world 12-lead ECG dataset. First, we estimate\nuncertainties using the Monte Carlo dropout for each classification prediction,\nbased on our Bayesian neural network. Then, we accept predictions with\nuncertainty under a given threshold and provide \"uncertain\" cases for\nclinicians. Furthermore, we perform a simulation experiment using varying\nthresholds. Finally, with the help of a clinician, we conduct case studies to\nexplain the results of large uncertainties and incorrect predictions with small\nuncertainties. The results show that correct predictions are more likely to\nhave smaller uncertainties, and the performance on accepted predictions\nimproves as the accepting ratio decreases (i.e. more rejections). Case studies\nalso help explain why rejection can improve the performance. Our study helps\nneural networks produce more accurate results and provide information on\nuncertainties to better assist clinicians in the diagnosis process.

The most natural and leading strategy is to train a\nquantum machine learning model based on a quantum dataset. Although presence of\nmore training data results in better models, using too much data reduces the\nefficiency of training. In this work, we solve the problem on the minimum size\nof sufficient quantum datasets for learning a unitary transformation exactly,\nwhich reveals the power and limitation of quantum data. First, we prove that\nthe minimum size of dataset with pure states is $2^n$ for learning an $n$-qubit\nunitary transformation. To fully explore the capability of quantum data, we\nintroduce a quantum dataset consisting of $n+1$ mixed states that are\nsufficient for exact training. The main idea is to simplify the structure\nutilizing decoupling, which leads to an exponential improvement on the size\nover the datasets with pure states. Furthermore, we show that the size of\nquantum dataset with mixed states can be reduced to a constant, which yields an\noptimal quantum dataset for learning a unitary. We showcase the applications of\nour results in oracle compiling and Hamiltonian simulation. Notably, to\naccurately simulate a 3-qubit one-dimensional nearest-neighbor Heisenberg\nmodel, our circuit only uses $48$ elementary quantum gates, which is\nsignificantly less than $4320$ gates in the circuit constructed by the\nTrotter-Suzuki product formula.",

Although nonlinear optimization\nsuch as non-linear least squares (NLLS) is the most widespread method for model\nestimation, it suffers from local minima and high computational cost. Deep\nLearning approaches are steadily replacing NL fitting, but come with the\nlimitation that the model needs to be retrained for each acquisition protocol\nand noise level. The White Matter Tract Integrity (WMTI)-Watson model was\nproposed as an implementation of the Standard Model of diffusion in white\nmatter that estimates model parameters from the diffusion and kurtosis tensors\n(DKI). Here we proposed a deep learning approach based on the encoder-decoder\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) to increase the robustness and accelerate the\nparameter estimation of WMTI-Watson. We use an embedding approach to render the\nmodel insensitive to potential differences in distributions between training\ndata and experimental data. This RNN-based solver thus has the advantage of\nbeing highly efficient in computation and more readily translatable to other\ndatasets, irrespective of acquisition protocol and underlying parameter\ndistributions as long as DKI was pre-computed from the data. In this study, we\nevaluated the performance of NLLS, the RNN-based method and a multilayer\nperceptron (MLP) on synthetic and in vivo datasets of rat and human brain.

    "abstract": "Purpose: To develop a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) model for\nvisualizing deep neural network (DNN) behavior during multi-parametric MRI\n(mp-MRI) based glioma segmentation as a method to enhance deep learning\nexplainability. Methods: By hypothesizing that deep feature extraction can be\nmodeled as a spatiotemporally continuous process, we designed a novel deep\nlearning model, neural ODE, in which deep feature extraction was governed by an\nODE without explicit expression. The dynamics of 1) MR images after\ninteractions with DNN and 2) segmentation formation can be visualized after\nsolving ODE. An accumulative contribution curve (ACC) was designed to\nquantitatively evaluate the utilization of each MRI by DNN towards the final\nsegmentation results. The proposed neural ODE model was demonstrated using 369\nglioma patients with a 4-modality mp-MRI protocol: T1, contrast-enhanced T1\n(T1-Ce), T2, and FLAIR. Three neural ODE models were trained to segment\nenhancing tumor (ET), tumor core (TC), and whole tumor (WT). The key MR\nmodalities with significant utilization by DNN were identified based on ACC\nanalysis. Segmentation results by DNN using only the key MR modalities were\ncompared to the ones using all 4 MR modalities. Results: All neural ODE models\nsuccessfully illustrated image dynamics as expected. ACC analysis identified\nT1-Ce as the only key modality in ET and TC segmentations, while both FLAIR and\nT2 were key modalities in WT segmentation. Compared to the U-Net results using\nall 4 MR modalities, Dice coefficient of ET (0.784->0.775), TC (0.760->0.758),\nand WT (0.841->0.837) using the key modalities only had minimal differences\nwithout significance. Conclusion: The neural ODE model offers a new tool for\noptimizing the deep learning model inputs with enhanced explainability.

However, most of the existing methods only\nfocus on the luminance component of JND modelling and simply regard chrominance\ncomponents as scaled versions of luminance. In this paper, we propose a JND\nmodel to generate the JND by taking the characteristics of full RGB channels\ninto account, termed as the RGB-JND. To this end, an RGB-JND-NET is proposed,\nwhere the visual content in full RGB channels is used to extract features for\nJND generation. To supervise the JND generation, an adaptive image quality\nassessment combination (AIC) is developed. Besides, the RDB-JND-NET also takes\nthe visual attention into account by automatically mining the underlying\nrelationship between visual attention and the JND, which is further used to\nconstrain the JND spatial distribution. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first work on careful investigation of JND modelling for full-color space.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the RGB-JND-NET model outperforms the\nrelevant state-of-the-art JND models. Besides, the JND of the red and blue\nchannels are larger than that of the green one according to the experimental\nresults of the proposed model, which demonstrates that more changes can be\ntolerated in the red and blue channels, in line with the well-known fact that\nthe human visual system is more sensitive to the green channel in comparison\nwith the red and blue ones.",

    "title": "Multi-Task Multi-Scale Learning For Outcome Prediction in 3D PET Images",
    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Predicting patient response to treatment and\nsurvival in oncology is a prominent way towards precision medicine. To that\nend, radiomics was proposed as a field of study where images are used instead\nof invasive methods. The first step in radiomic analysis is the segmentation of\nthe lesion. However, this task is time consuming and can be physician\nsubjective. Automated tools based on supervised deep learning have made great\nprogress to assist physicians. However, they are data hungry, and annotated\ndata remains a major issue in the medical field where only a small subset of\nannotated images is available. Methods: In this work, we propose a multi-task\nlearning framework to predict patient's survival and response. We show that the\nencoder can leverage multiple tasks to extract meaningful and powerful features\nthat improve radiomics performance. We show also that subsidiary tasks serve as\nan inductive bias so that the model can better generalize. Results: Our model\nwas tested and validated for treatment response and survival in lung and\nesophageal cancers, with an area under the ROC curve of 77% and 71%\nrespectively, outperforming single task learning methods. Conclusions: We show\nthat, by using a multi-task learning approach, we can boost the performance of\nradiomic analysis by extracting rich information of intratumoral and\nperitumoral regions.",
