    "title": "Reactive Whole-Body Obstacle Avoidance for Collision-Free Human-Robot  Interaction with Topological Manifold Learning",
    "abstract": "Safe collaboration between human and robots in a common unstructured\nenvironment becomes increasingly critical with the emergence of Industry 4.0.\nHowever, to accomplish safe, robust, and autonomous collaboration with humans,\nmodern robotic systems must possess not only effective proximity perception but\nalso reactive obstacle avoidance. Unfortunately, for most robotic systems,\ntheir shared working environment with human operators may not always be static,\ninstead often dynamically varying and being constantly cluttered with\nunanticipated obstacles or hazards. In this paper, we present a novel\nmethodology of reactive whole-body obstacle avoidance methodology that\nsafeguards the human who enters the robot's workspace through achieving\nconflict-free human-robot interactions even in a dynamically constrained\nenvironment. Unlike existing Jacobian-type or geometric approaches, our\nproposed methodology leverages both topological manifold learning and latest\ndeep learning advances, therefore can not only be readily generalized into\nother unseen problem settings, but also achieve high computing efficiency with\nconcrete theoretical basis. Furthermore, in sharp contrast to the industrial\ncobot setting, our methodology allows a robotic arm to proactively avoid\nobstacles of arbitrary 3D shapes without direct contacting. To solidify our\nstudy, we implement and validate our methodology with a robotic platform\nconsisting of dual 6-DoF robotic arms with optimized proximity sensor\nplacement, both of which are capable of working collaboratively with different\nlevels of interference. Specifically, one arm will perform reactive whole-body\nobstacle avoidance while achieving its pre-determined objective, with the other\narm emulating the presence of a human collaborator with independent and\npotentially adversary movements.",

    "title": "A Stitch in Time Saves Nine: A Train-Time Regularizing Loss for Improved  Neural Network Calibration",
    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks ( DNN s) are known to make overconfident mistakes, which\nmakes their use problematic in safety-critical applications. State-of-the-art (\nSOTA ) calibration techniques improve on the confidence of predicted labels\nalone and leave the confidence of non-max classes (e.g. top-2, top-5)\nuncalibrated. Such calibration is not suitable for label refinement using\npost-processing. Further, most SOTA techniques learn a few hyper-parameters\npost-hoc, leaving out the scope for image, or pixel specific calibration. This\nmakes them unsuitable for calibration under domain shift, or for dense\nprediction tasks like semantic segmentation. In this paper, we argue for\nintervening at the train time itself, so as to directly produce calibrated DNN\nmodels. We propose a novel auxiliary loss function: Multi-class Difference in\nConfidence and Accuracy ( MDCA ), to achieve the same MDCA can be used in\nconjunction with other application/task-specific loss functions. We show that\ntraining with MDCA leads to better-calibrated models in terms of Expected\nCalibration Error ( ECE ), and Static Calibration Error ( SCE ) on image\nclassification, and segmentation tasks. We report ECE ( SCE ) score of 0.72\n(1.60) on the CIFAR 100 dataset, in comparison to 1.90 (1.71) by the SOTA.\nUnder domain shift, a ResNet-18 model trained on PACS dataset using MDCA gives\nan average ECE ( SCE ) score of 19.7 (9.7) across all domains, compared to 24.2\n(11.8) by the SOTA. For the segmentation task, we report a 2X reduction in\ncalibration error on PASCAL - VOC dataset in comparison to Focal Loss. Finally,\nMDCA training improves calibration even on imbalanced data, and for natural\nlanguage classification tasks. We have released the code here: code is\navailable at https://github.com/mdca-loss",

Given a natural language navigation instruction, a\nvisual agent interacts with a graph-based environment equipped with panorama\nimages and tries to follow the described route.

We focus on VLN in outdoor\nscenarios and find that in contrast to indoor VLN, most of the gain in outdoor\nVLN on unseen data is due to features like junction type embedding or heading\ndelta that are specific to the respective environment graph, while image\ninformation plays a very minor role in generalizing VLN to unseen outdoor\nareas.

    "abstract": "Learning from Demonstration (LfD) seeks to democratize robotics by enabling\ndiverse end-users to teach robots to perform a task by providing\ndemonstrations. However, most LfD techniques assume users provide optimal\ndemonstrations. This is not always the case in real applications where users\nare likely to provide demonstrations of varying quality, that may change with\nexpertise and other factors. Demonstration quality plays a crucial role in\nrobot learning and generalization. Hence, it is important to quantify the\nquality of the provided demonstrations before using them for robot learning. In\nthis paper, we propose quantifying the quality of the demonstrations based on\nhow well they perform in the learned task. We hypothesize that task performance\ncan give an indication of the generalization performance on similar tasks. The\nproposed approach is validated in a user study (N = 27). Users with different\nrobotics expertise levels were recruited to teach a PR2 robot a generic task\n(pressing a button) under different task constraints. They taught the robot in\ntwo sessions on two different days to capture their teaching behaviour across\nsessions. The task performance was utilized to classify the provided\ndemonstrations into high-quality and low-quality sets. The results show a\nsignificant Pearson correlation coefficient (R = 0.85, p < 0.0001) between the\ntask performance and generalization performance across all participants. We\nalso found that users clustered into two groups: Users who provided\nhigh-quality demonstrations from the first session, assigned to the\nfast-adapters group, and users who provided low-quality demonstrations in the\nfirst session and then improved with practice, assigned to the slow-adapters\ngroup. These results highlight the importance of quantifying demonstration\nquality, which can be indicative of the adaptation level of the user to the\ntask.",

    "abstract": "Recording fast motion in a high FPS (frame-per-second) requires expensive\nhigh-speed cameras. As an alternative, interpolating low-FPS videos from\ncommodity cameras has attracted significant attention. If only low-FPS videos\nare available, motion assumptions (linear or quadratic) are necessary to infer\nintermediate frames, which fail to model complex motions. Event camera, a new\ncamera with pixels producing events of brightness change at the temporal\nresolution of $\\mu s$ $(10^{-6}$ second $)$, is a game-changing device to\nenable video interpolation at the presence of arbitrarily complex motion. Since\nevent camera is a novel sensor, its potential has not been fulfilled due to the\nlack of processing algorithms. The pioneering work Time Lens introduced event\ncameras to video interpolation by designing optical devices to collect a large\namount of paired training data of high-speed frames and events, which is too\ncostly to scale. To fully unlock the potential of event cameras, this paper\nproposes a novel TimeReplayer algorithm to interpolate videos captured by\ncommodity cameras with events. It is trained in an unsupervised\ncycle-consistent style, canceling the necessity of high-speed training data and\nbringing the additional ability of video extrapolation.

    "abstract": "The need for a large amount of labeled data in the supervised setting has led\nrecent studies to utilize self-supervised learning to pre-train deep neural\nnetworks using unlabeled data. Many self-supervised training strategies have\nbeen investigated especially for medical datasets to leverage the information\navailable in the much fewer unlabeled data. One of the fundamental strategies\nin image-based self-supervision is context prediction. In this approach, a\nmodel is trained to reconstruct the contents of an arbitrary missing region of\nan image based on its surroundings.

    "abstract": "Battery energy storage systems can be used for peak demand reduction in power\nsystems, leading to significant economic benefits. Two practical challenges are\n1) accurately determining the peak load days and hours and 2) quantifying and\nreducing uncertainties associated with the forecast in probabilistic risk\nmeasures for dispatch decision-making. In this study, we develop a supervised\nmachine learning approach to generate 1) the probability of the next operation\nday containing the peak hour of the month and 2) the probability of an hour to\nbe the peak hour of the day. Guidance is provided on the preparation and\naugmentation of data as well as the selection of machine learning models and\ndecision-making thresholds. The proposed approach is applied to the Duke Energy\nProgress system and successfully captures 69 peak days out of 72 testing months\nwith a 3% exceedance probability threshold. On 90% of the peak days, the actual\npeak hour is among the 2 hours with the highest probabilities.",

    "abstract": "Research into influence campaigns on Twitter has mostly relied on identifying\nmalicious activities from tweets obtained via public APIs. These APIs provide\naccess to public tweets that have not been deleted. However, bad actors can\ndelete content strategically to manipulate the system. Unfortunately, estimates\nbased on publicly available Twitter data underestimate the true deletion\nvolume. Here, we provide the first exhaustive, large-scale analysis of\nanomalous deletion patterns involving more than a billion deletions by over 11\nmillion accounts. We find that a small fraction of accounts delete a large\nnumber of tweets daily. We also uncover two abusive behaviors that exploit\ndeletions. First, limits on tweet volume are circumvented, allowing certain\naccounts to flood the network with over 26 thousand daily tweets. Second,\ncoordinated networks of accounts engage in repetitive likes and unlikes of\ncontent that is eventually deleted, which can manipulate ranking algorithms.\nThese kinds of abuse can be exploited to amplify content and inflate\npopularity, while evading detection. Our study provides platforms and\nresearchers with new methods for identifying social media abuse.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a critical capability in\nautonomous navigation, but in order to scale SLAM to the setting of \"lifelong\"\nSLAM, particularly under memory or computation constraints, a robot must be\nable to determine what information should be retained and what can safely be\nforgotten. In graph-based SLAM, the number of edges (measurements) in a pose\ngraph determines both the memory requirements of storing a robot's observations\nand the computational expense of algorithms deployed for performing state\nestimation using those observations; both of which can grow unbounded during\nlong-term navigation. To address this, we propose a spectral approach for pose\ngraph sparsification which maximizes the algebraic connectivity of the\nsparsified measurement graphs, a key quantity which has been shown to control\nthe estimation error of pose graph SLAM solutions. Our algorithm, MAC (for\n\"maximizing algebraic connectivity\"), which is based on convex relaxation, is\nsimple and computationally inexpensive, and admits formal post hoc performance\nguarantees on the quality of the solutions it provides. In experiments on\nbenchmark pose-graph SLAM datasets, we show that our approach quickly produces\nhigh-quality sparsification results which retain the connectivity of the graph\nand, in turn, the quality of corresponding SLAM solutions, as compared to a\nbaseline approach which does not consider graph connectivity.",

    "abstract": "In 1982, Papadimitriou and Yannakakis introduced the Exact Matching (EM)\nproblem where given an edge colored graph, with colors red and blue, and an\ninteger $k$, the goal is to decided whether or not the graph contains a perfect\nmatching with exactly $k$ red edges. Although they conjectured it to be\n$\\textbf{NP}$-complete, soon after it was shown to be solvable in randomized\npolynomial time in the seminal work of Mulmuley et al. placing it in the\ncomplexity class $\\textbf{RP}$. Since then, all attempts at finding a\ndeterministic algorithm for EM have failed, thus leaving it as one of the few\nnatural combinatorial problems in $\\textbf{RP}$ but not known to be contained\nin $\\textbf{P}$, and making it an interesting instance for testing the\nhypothesis $\\textbf{RP}=\\textbf{P}$. Progress has been lacking even on very\nrestrictive classes of graphs despite the problem being quite well known as\nevidenced by the number of works citing it. In this paper we aim to gain more\ninsight into the problem by considering two directions of study. In the first\ndirection, we study EM on bipartite graphs with a relaxation of the color\nconstraint and provide an algorithm where the output is required to be a\nperfect matching with a number of red edges differing from $k$ by at most\n$k/2$. We also introduce an optimisation problem we call Top-k Perfect Matching\n(TkPM) that shares many similarities with EM. By virtue of being an\noptimization problem, it is more natural to approximate so we provide\napproximation algorithms for it. In the second direction, we look at the\nparameterized algorithms. Here we introduce new tools and FPT algorithms for\nthe study of EM and TkPM.",

    "abstract": "We consider the allocation of $m$ balls (jobs) into $n$ bins (servers). In\nthe Two-Choice process, for each of $m$ sequentially arriving balls, two\nrandomly chosen bins are sampled and the ball is placed in the least loaded\nbin. It is well-known that the maximum load is $m/n+\\log_2 \\log n + O(1)$\nw.h.p.\nBerenbrink, Czumaj, Englert, Friedetzky and Nagel (2012) introduced a\nparallel version of this process, where $m$ balls arrive in consecutive batches\nof size $b=n$ each. Balls within the same batch are allocated in parallel,\nusing the load information of the bins at the beginning of the batch. They\nproved that the gap of this process is $O(\\log n)$ with high probability.\nIn this work, we present a new analysis of this setting, which is based on\nexponential potential functions. This allows us to both simplify and generalize\nthe analysis of [BCE12] in different ways:\n$\\quad 1.$ Our analysis covers a broad class of processes. This includes not\nonly Two-Choice, but also processes with fewer bin samples like $(1+\\beta)$,\nprocesses which can only receive one bit of information from each bin sample\nand graphical allocation, where bins correspond to vertices in a graph.\n$\\quad 2.$ Balls may be of different weights, as long as their weights are\nindependent samples from a distribution satisfying a technical condition on its\nmoment generating function.\n$\\quad 3.$ For arbitrary batch sizes $b \\geq n$, we prove a gap of $O(b/n\n\\cdot \\log n)$. For any $b \\in [n , n^3]$, we improve this to $O(b/n + \\log n)$\nand show that it is tight for a family of processes. This implies the\nunexpected result that for e.g. $(1+\\beta)$ with constant $\\beta \\in (0, 1]$,\nthe gap is $\\Theta(\\log n)$ for all $b \\in [n,n \\log n]$.\nWe also conduct experiments which support our theoretical results, and even\nhint at a superiority of less powerful processes like $(1+\\beta)$ for large\nbatch sizes.",

We take a\ncloser look at important design choices of such methods, leading to several key\nimprovements and resulting in a more accurate and flexible framework, which we\ncall Sylph.

Contrary to\nwhat previous results have suggested, we show that with a carefully designed\nclass-conditional hypernetwork, finetune-free iFSD can be highly effective,\nespecially when a large number of base categories with abundant data are\navailable for meta-training, almost approaching alternatives that undergo\ntest-time-training. This result is even more significant considering its many\npractical advantages: (1) incrementally learning new classes in sequence\nwithout additional training, (2) detecting both novel and seen classes in a\nsingle pass, and (3) no forgetting of previously seen classes. We benchmark our\nmodel on both COCO and LVIS, reporting as high as $17\\%$ AP on the long-tail\nrare classes on LVIS, indicating the promise of hypernetwork-based iFSD.",

Graph-based data\nmodels elucidate the interconnectedness between core biomedical concepts,\nenable data structures to be easily updated, and support intuitive queries,\nvisualizations, and inference algorithms. However, knowledge discovery across\nthese \"knowledge graphs\" (KGs) has remained difficult. Data set heterogeneity\nand complexity; the proliferation of ad hoc data formats; poor compliance with\nguidelines on findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability;\nand, in particular, the lack of a universally-accepted, open-access model for\nstandardization across biomedical KGs has left the task of reconciling data\nsources to downstream consumers. Biolink Model is an open source data model\nthat can be used to formalize the relationships between data structures in\ntranslational science. It incorporates object-oriented classification and\ngraph-oriented features. The core of the model is a set of hierarchical,\ninterconnected classes (or categories) and relationships between them (or\npredicates), representing biomedical entities such as gene, disease, chemical,\nanatomical structure, and phenotype. The model provides class and edge\nattributes and associations that guide how entities should relate to one\nanother. Here, we highlight the need for a standardized data model for KGs,\ndescribe Biolink Model, and compare it with other models. We demonstrate the\nutility of Biolink Model in various initiatives, including the Biomedical Data\nTranslator Consortium and the Monarch Initiative, and show how it has supported\neasier integration and interoperability of biomedical KGs, bringing together\nknowledge from multiple sources and helping to realize the goals of\ntranslational science.",

This is a\nkey task in computational science and engineering, e.g., surrogate modelling in\nUQ where the function is the solution map of a parametric or stochastic PDE.\nYet, sparse polynomial approximation lacks a complete theory. On the one hand,\nthere is a well-developed theory of best $s$-term polynomial approximation,\nwhich asserts exponential or algebraic rates of convergence for holomorphic\nfunctions. On the other hand, there are increasingly mature methods such as\n(weighted) $\\ell^1$-minimization for computing such approximations. While the\nsample complexity of these methods has been analyzed in detail, the matter of\nwhether or not these methods achieve such rates is not well understood.\nFurthermore, these methods are not algorithms per se, since they involve exact\nminimizers of nonlinear optimization problems.\nThis paper closes these gaps. Specifically, we pose and answer the following\nquestion: are there robust, efficient algorithms for computing approximations\nto finite- or infinite-dimensional, holomorphic and Hilbert-valued functions\nfrom limited samples that achieve best $s$-term rates? We answer this in the\naffirmative by introducing algorithms and theoretical guarantees that assert\nexponential or algebraic rates of convergence, along with robustness to\nsampling, algorithmic, and physical discretization errors. We tackle both\nscalar- and Hilbert-valued functions, this being particularly relevant to\nparametric and stochastic PDEs.

We evaluate our approach by performing text completion on\ncanaries and demonstrate that by using the prefix (non-sensitive) tokens of the\ncanary, we can generate the full canary. As an example, our attack is able to\nreconstruct a four digit code in the training dataset of the NLU model with a\nprobability of 0.5 in its best configuration. As countermeasures, we identify\nseveral defense mechanisms that, when combined, effectively eliminate the risk\nof ModIvA in our experiments.",

    "title": "A Semi-Decoupled Approach to Fast and Optimal Hardware-Software  Co-Design of Neural Accelerators",
    "abstract": "In view of the performance limitations of fully-decoupled designs for neural\narchitectures and accelerators, hardware-software co-design has been emerging\nto fully reap the benefits of flexible design spaces and optimize neural\nnetwork performance. Nonetheless, such co-design also enlarges the total search\nspace to practically infinity and presents substantial challenges. While the\nprior studies have been focusing on improving the search efficiency (e.g., via\nreinforcement learning), they commonly rely on co-searches over the entire\narchitecture-accelerator design space. In this paper, we propose a\n\\emph{semi}-decoupled approach to reduce the size of the total design space by\norders of magnitude, yet without losing optimality. We first perform neural\narchitecture search to obtain a small set of optimal architectures for one\naccelerator candidate. Importantly, this is also the set of (close-to-)optimal\narchitectures for other accelerator designs based on the property that neural\narchitectures' ranking orders in terms of inference latency and energy\nconsumption on different accelerator designs are highly similar. Then, instead\nof considering all the possible architectures, we optimize the accelerator\ndesign only in combination with this small set of architectures, thus\nsignificantly reducing the total search cost. We validate our approach by\nconducting experiments on various architecture spaces for accelerator designs\nwith different dataflows. Our results highlight that we can obtain the optimal\ndesign by only navigating over the reduced search space. The source code of\nthis work is at \\url{https://github.com/Ren-Research/CoDesign}.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems play a significant role in information filtering and have\nbeen utilised in different scenarios, such as e-commerce and social media. With\nthe prosperity of deep learning, deep recommender systems show superior\nperformance by capturing non-linear information and item-user relationships.\nHowever, the design of deep recommender systems heavily relies on human\nexperiences and expert knowledge. To tackle this problem, Automated Machine\nLearning (AutoML) is introduced to automatically search for the proper\ncandidates for different parts of deep recommender systems. This survey\nperforms a comprehensive review of the literature in this field. Firstly, we\npropose an abstract concept for AutoML for deep recommender systems\n(AutoRecSys) that describes its building blocks and distinguishes it from\nconventional AutoML techniques and recommender systems. Secondly, we present a\ntaxonomy as a classification framework containing embedding dimension search,\nfeature interaction search, model design search and other components search.\nFurthermore, we put a particular emphasis on the search space and search\nstrategy, as they are the common thread to connect all methods within each\ncategory and enable practitioners to analyse and compare various approaches.\nFinally, we propose four future promising research directions that will lead\nthis line of research.",

    "title": "A Meta Survey of Quality Evaluation Criteria in Explanation Methods",
    "abstract": "Explanation methods and their evaluation have become a significant issue in\nexplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) due to the recent surge of opaque AI\nmodels in decision support systems (DSS). Since the most accurate AI models are\nopaque with low transparency and comprehensibility, explanations are essential\nfor bias detection and control of uncertainty. There are a plethora of criteria\nto choose from when evaluating explanation method quality. However, since\nexisting criteria focus on evaluating single explanation methods, it is not\nobvious how to compare the quality of different methods. This lack of consensus\ncreates a critical shortage of rigour in the field, although little is written\nabout comparative evaluations of explanation methods. In this paper, we have\nconducted a semi-systematic meta-survey over fifteen literature surveys\ncovering the evaluation of explainability to identify existing criteria usable\nfor comparative evaluations of explanation methods. The main contribution in\nthe paper is the suggestion to use appropriate trust as a criterion to measure\nthe outcome of the subjective evaluation criteria and consequently make\ncomparative evaluations possible. We also present a model of explanation\nquality aspects. In the model, criteria with similar definitions are grouped\nand related to three identified aspects of quality; model, explanation, and\nuser. We also notice four commonly accepted criteria (groups) in the\nliterature, covering all aspects of explanation quality: Performance,\nappropriate trust, explanation satisfaction, and fidelity. We suggest the model\nbe used as a chart for comparative evaluations to create more generalisable\nresearch in explanation quality.",

    "abstract": "The impression we make on others depends not only on what we say, but also,\nto a large extent, on how we say it. As a sub-branch of affective computing and\nsocial signal processing, impression recognition has proven critical in both\nhuman-human conversations and spoken dialogue systems. However, most research\nhas studied impressions only from the signals expressed by the emitter,\nignoring the response from the receiver. In this paper, we perform impression\nrecognition using a proposed cross-domain architecture on the dyadic IMPRESSION\ndataset. This improved architecture makes use of cross-domain attention and\nregularization. The cross-domain attention consists of intra- and\ninter-attention mechanisms, which capture intra- and inter-domain relatedness,\nrespectively. The cross-domain regularization includes knowledge distillation\nand similarity enhancement losses, which strengthen the feature connections\nbetween the emitter and receiver. The experimental evaluation verified the\neffectiveness of our approach. Our approach achieved a concordance correlation\ncoefficient of 0.770 in competence dimension and 0.748 in warmth dimension.",

Misestimation may cause tissue waste\nand increased laboratory costs. We developed an AI-augmented smart pathology\nreview system (SmartPath) to empower pathologists with quantitative metrics for\ndetermining tissue extraction parameters. Using digitized H&E-stained FFPE\nslides as inputs, SmartPath segments tumors, extracts cell-based features, and\nsuggests a macrodissection areas. To predict DNA yield per slide, the extracted\nfeatures are correlated with known DNA yields. Then, a pathologist-defined\ntarget yield divided by the predicted DNA yield/slide gives the number of\nslides to scrape. Following model development, an internal validation trial was\nconducted within the Tempus Labs molecular sequencing laboratory. We evaluated\nour system on 501 clinical colorectal cancer slides, where half received\nSmartPath-augmented review and half traditional pathologist review. The\nSmartPath cohort had 25% more DNA yields within a desired target range of\n100-2000ng. The SmartPath system recommended fewer slides to scrape for large\ntissue sections, saving tissue in these cases. Conversely, SmartPath\nrecommended more slides to scrape for samples with scant tissue sections,\nhelping prevent costly re-extraction due to insufficient extraction yield. A\nstatistical analysis was performed to measure the impact of covariates on the\nresults, offering insights on how to improve future applications of SmartPath.\nOverall, the study demonstrated that AI-augmented histopathologic review using\nSmartPath could decrease tissue waste, sequencing time, and laboratory costs by\noptimizing DNA yields and tumor purity.",

CE-FL considers\nthe heterogeneity of network elements in terms of communication/computation\nmodels and the proximity to one another. CE-FL further presumes a dynamic\nenvironment with online variation of data at the network devices which causes a\ndrift at the ML model performance. We model the processes taken during CE-FL,\nand conduct analytical convergence analysis of its ML model training. We then\nformulate network-aware CE-FL which aims to adaptively optimize all the network\nelements via tuning their contribution to the learning process, which turns out\nto be a non-convex mixed integer problem. Motivated by the large scale of the\nsystem, we propose a distributed optimization solver to break down the\ncomputation of the solution across the network elements. We finally demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our framework with the data collected from a real-world\ntestbed.",

    "abstract": "The task of Human-Object Interaction~(HOI) detection could be divided into\ntwo core problems, i.e., human-object association and interaction\nunderstanding. In this paper, we reveal and address the disadvantages of the\nconventional query-driven HOI detectors from the two aspects. For the\nassociation, previous two-branch methods suffer from complex and costly\npost-matching, while single-branch methods ignore the features distinction in\ndifferent tasks. We propose Guided-Embedding Network~(GEN) to attain a\ntwo-branch pipeline without post-matching. In GEN, we design an instance\ndecoder to detect humans and objects with two independent query sets and a\nposition Guided Embedding~(p-GE) to mark the human and object in the same\nposition as a pair. Besides, we design an interaction decoder to classify\ninteractions, where the interaction queries are made of instance Guided\nEmbeddings (i-GE) generated from the outputs of each instance decoder layer.\nFor the interaction understanding, previous methods suffer from long-tailed\ndistribution and zero-shot discovery. This paper proposes a Visual-Linguistic\nKnowledge Transfer (VLKT) training strategy to enhance interaction\nunderstanding by transferring knowledge from a visual-linguistic pre-trained\nmodel CLIP. In specific, we extract text embeddings for all labels with CLIP to\ninitialize the classifier and adopt a mimic loss to minimize the visual feature\ndistance between GEN and CLIP. As a result, GEN-VLKT outperforms the state of\nthe art by large margins on multiple datasets, e.g., +5.05 mAP on HICO-Det. The\nsource codes are available at https://github.com/YueLiao/gen-vlkt.",

    "abstract": "The interventional nature of recommendation has attracted increasing\nattention in recent years. It particularly motivates researchers to formulate\nlearning and evaluating recommendation as causal inference and data\nmissing-not-at-random problems. However, few take seriously the consequence of\nviolating the critical assumption of overlapping, which we prove can\nsignificantly threaten the validity and interpretation of the outcome. We find\na critical piece missing in the current understanding of information retrieval\n(IR) systems: as interventions, recommendation not only affects the already\nobserved data, but it also interferes with the target domain (distribution) of\ninterest. We then rephrase optimizing recommendation as finding an intervention\nthat best transports the patterns it learns from the observed domain to its\nintervention domain. Towards this end, we use domain transportation to\ncharacterize the learning-intervention mechanism of recommendation. We design a\nprincipled transportation-constraint risk minimization objective and convert it\nto a two-player minimax game. We prove the consistency, generalization, and\nexcessive risk bounds for the proposed objective, and elaborate how they\ncompare to the current results. Finally, we carry out extensive real-data and\nsemi-synthetic experiments to demonstrate the advantage of our approach, and\nlaunch online testing with a real-world IR system.",

This paper introduces a novel robust and adaptive\ncontrol synthesis methodology for a quadrotor robot's attitude and altitude\nstabilization.

The proposed controller does\nnot require any prior training. The performance of the designed controller is\ncompared with that of a fixed-gain SNI controller, a fuzzy-SNI controller, and\na conventional PID controller in a series of numerical simulations.\nFurthermore, the stability of the proposed controller and the adaptive laws are\nproofed using the NI theorem.",

This reality is not surprising: without handy\ntheoretical tools, we often lack principled knowledge of the pattern\nrecognition model's expressivity, optimization property, generalization\nguarantee, and our decision-making process has to rely on over-simplified\nassumptions and human judgments from time to time.\nTime is now to bring the community a systematic tutorial on how we\nsuccessfully adapt those tools and make significant progress in understanding,\ndesigning, and eventually productionize impactful IR systems.

In this study, we introduced a self-attention\nmechanism into the intersection recognition system as a method to capture the\nnon-local contexts behind the scenes. An intersection classification system\ncomprises two distinctive modules: (a) a first-person vision (FPV) module,\nwhich uses a short egocentric view sequence as the intersection is passed, and\n(b) a third-person vision (TPV) module, which uses a single view immediately\nbefore entering the intersection. The self-attention mechanism is effective in\nthe TPV module because most parts of the local pattern (e.g., road edges,\nbuildings, and sky) are similar to each other, and thus the use of a non-local\ncontext (e.g., the angle between two diagonal corners around an intersection)\nwould be effective. This study makes three major contributions. First, we\nproposed a self-attention-based approach for intersection classification using\nTPVs. Second, we presented a practical system in which a self-attention-based\nTPV module is combined with an FPV module to improve the overall recognition\nperformance.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems based on collaborative filtering play a vital role in\nmany E-commerce applications as they guide the user in finding their items of\ninterest based on the user's past transactions and feedback of other similar\ncustomers. Data Sparsity is one of the major drawbacks with collaborative\nfiltering technique arising due to the less number of transactions and feedback\ndata. In order to reduce the sparsity problem, techniques called transfer\nlearning/cross-domain recommendation has emerged. In transfer learning methods,\nthe data from other dense domain(s) (source) is considered in order to predict\nthe missing ratings in the sparse domain (target). In this paper, we come up\nwith a novel transfer learning approach for cross-domain recommendation,\nwherein the cluster-level rating pattern(codebook) of the source domain is\nobtained via a co-clustering technique. Thereafter we apply the Maximum Margin\nMatrix factorization (MMMF) technique on the codebook in order to learn the\nuser and item latent features of codebook. Prediction of the target rating\nmatrix is achieved by introducing these latent features in a novel way into the\noptimisation function. In the experiments we demonstrate that our model\nimproves the prediction accuracy of the target matrix on benchmark datasets.",

To boost the\ntransferability of depth estimation models, we propose an adversarial depth\nestimation task and train the model in the pipeline of meta-learning.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, airport detection in remote sensing images has attracted\nconsiderable attention due to its strategic role in civilian and military\nscopes. In particular, uncrewed and operated aerial vehicles must immediately\ndetect safe areas to land in emergencies. The previous schemes suffered from\nvarious aspects, including complicated backgrounds, scales, and shapes of the\nairport. Meanwhile, the rapid action and accuracy of the method are confronted\nwith significant concerns. Hence, this study proposes an effective scheme by\nextending YOLOV3 and ShearLet transform. In this way, MobileNet and ResNet18,\nwith fewer layers and parameters retrained on a similar dataset, are parallelly\ntrained as base networks. According to airport geometrical characteristics, the\nShearLet filters with different scales and directions are considered in the\nfirst convolution layers of ResNet18 as a visual attention mechanism. Besides,\nthe major extended in YOLOV3 concerns the detection Sub-Networks with novel\nstructures which boost object expression ability and training efficiency. In\naddition, novel augmentation and negative mining strategies are presented to\nsignificantly increase the localization phase's performance. The experimental\nresults on the DIOR dataset reveal that the framework reliably detects\ndifferent types of airports in a varied area and acquires robust results in\ncomplex scenes compared to traditional YOLOV3 and state-of-the-art schemes.",

In this work, we present a novel and efficient modeling that\nstarts from interpreting the image as a tessellation of learnable regions, each\nof which has flexible geometrics and carries homogeneous semantics. To model\nregion-wise context, we exploit Transformer to encode regions in a\nsequence-to-sequence manner by applying multi-layer self-attention on the\nregion embeddings, which serve as proxies of specific regions. Semantic\nsegmentation is now carried out as per-region prediction on top of the encoded\nregion embeddings using a single linear classifier, where a decoder is no\nlonger needed. The proposed RegProxy model discards the common Cartesian\nfeature layout and operates purely at region level.

    "title": "Adaptively Lighting up Facial Expression Crucial Regions via Local  Non-Local Joint Network",
    "abstract": "Facial expression recognition (FER) is still one challenging research due to\nthe small inter-class discrepancy in the facial expression data. In view of the\nsignificance of facial crucial regions for FER, many existing researches\nutilize the prior information from some annotated crucial points to improve the\nperformance of FER. However, it is complicated and time-consuming to manually\nannotate facial crucial points, especially for vast wild expression images.\nBased on this, a local non-local joint network is proposed to adaptively light\nup the facial crucial regions in feature learning of FER in this paper. In the\nproposed method, two parts are constructed based on facial local and non-local\ninformation respectively, where an ensemble of multiple local networks are\nproposed to extract local features corresponding to multiple facial local\nregions and a non-local attention network is addressed to explore the\nsignificance of each local region. Especially, the attention weights obtained\nby the non-local network is fed into the local part to achieve the interactive\nfeedback between the facial global and local information. Interestingly, the\nnon-local weights corresponding to local regions are gradually updated and\nhigher weights are given to more crucial regions. Moreover, U-Net is employed\nto extract the integrated features of deep semantic information and low\nhierarchical detail information of expression images. Finally, experimental\nresults illustrate that the proposed method achieves more competitive\nperformance compared with several state-of-the art methods on five benchmark\ndatasets. Noticeably, the analyses of the non-local weights corresponding to\nlocal regions demonstrate that the proposed method can automatically enhance\nsome crucial regions in the process of feature learning without any facial\nlandmark information.",

Recent\nstudies however show that neural networks (both shallow and deep) may be easily\nfooled by certain imperceptibly perturbed input samples called adversarial\nexamples. Such security vulnerability has resulted in a large body of research\nin recent years because real-world threats could be introduced due to vast\napplications of neural networks. To address the robustness issue to adversarial\nexamples particularly in pattern recognition, robust adversarial training has\nbecome one mainstream. Various ideas, methods, and applications have boomed in\nthe field. Yet, a deep understanding of adversarial training including\ncharacteristics, interpretations, theories, and connections among different\nmodels has still remained elusive. In this paper, we present a comprehensive\nsurvey trying to offer a systematic and structured investigation on robust\nadversarial training in pattern recognition. We start with fundamentals\nincluding definition, notations, and properties of adversarial examples. We\nthen introduce a unified theoretical framework for defending against\nadversarial samples - robust adversarial training with visualizations and\ninterpretations on why adversarial training can lead to model robustness.\nConnections will be also established between adversarial training and other\ntraditional learning theories. After that, we summarize, review, and discuss\nvarious methodologies with adversarial attack and defense/training algorithms\nin a structured way.

    "abstract": "Deep Implicit Function (DIF) has gained popularity as an efficient 3D shape\nrepresentation. To capture geometry details, current methods usually learn DIF\nusing local latent codes, which discretize the space into a regular 3D grid (or\noctree) and store local codes in grid points (or octree nodes). Given a query\npoint, the local feature is computed by interpolating its neighboring local\ncodes with their positions. However, the local codes are constrained at\ndiscrete and regular positions like grid points, which makes the code positions\ndifficult to be optimized and limits their representation ability. To solve\nthis problem, we propose to learn DIF with Dynamic Code Cloud, named DCC-DIF.\nOur method explicitly associates local codes with learnable position vectors,\nand the position vectors are continuous and can be dynamically optimized, which\nimproves the representation ability. In addition, we propose a novel code\nposition loss to optimize the code positions, which heuristically guides more\nlocal codes to be distributed around complex geometric details. In contrast to\nprevious methods, our DCC-DIF represents 3D shapes more efficiently with a\nsmall amount of local codes, and improves the reconstruction quality.\nExperiments demonstrate that DCC-DIF achieves better performance over previous\nmethods.

Second, we curate 104,412 English-Indic\ntransliteration pairs from Wikidata across these languages.

Specifically, we formulate a game theoretical resource\nallocation and task offloading problem (GTRATOP) that aims to maximize the\nsystem performance by jointly considering the incentive for cooperation,\ncompetition among vehicles, heterogeneity between VEC servers and vehicles, and\ninherent dynamic of VNs. Since the formulated GTRATOP is NP-hard, we propose an\nadaptive approach for resource allocation and task offloading in VEC networks\nby incorporating bargaining game and matching game, which is called\nBARGAIN-MATCH.

One of\nthe key quality aspects, generalization, is concerned with measuring the degree\nof overfitting of a process model w.r.t. an event log, since the recorded\nbehavior is just an example of the true behavior of the underlying business\nprocess. Existing generalization measures exhibit several shortcomings that\nseverely hinder their applicability in practice. For example, they assume the\nevent log fully fits the discovered process model, and cannot deal with large\nreal-life event logs and complex process models. More significantly, current\nmeasures neglect generalizations for clear patterns that demand a certain\nconstruct in the model. For example, a repeating sequence in an event log\nshould be generalized with a loop structure in the model. We address these\nshortcomings by proposing a framework of measures that generalize a set of\npatterns discovered from an event log with representative traces and check the\ncorresponding control-flow structures in the process model via their trace\nalignment. We instantiate the framework with a generalization measure that uses\ntandem repeats to identify repetitive patterns that are compared to the loop\nstructures and a concurrency oracle to identify concurrent patterns that are\ncompared to the parallel structures of the process model. In an extensive\nqualitative and quantitative evaluation using 74 log-model pairs using against\ntwo baseline generalization measures, we show that the proposed generalization\nmeasure consistently ranks process models that fulfil the observed patterns\nwith generalizing control-flow structures higher than those which do not, while\nthe baseline measures disregard those patterns. Further, we show that our\nmeasure can be efficiently computed for datasets two orders of magnitude larger\nthan the largest dataset the baseline generalization measures can handle.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from weak-generalization due to\nsparsely labeled data despite their promising results on various graph-based\ntasks. Data augmentation is a prevalent remedy to improve the generalization\nability of models in many domains. However, due to the non-Euclidean nature of\ndata space and the dependencies between samples, designing effective\naugmentation on graphs is challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework Metropolis-Hastings Data Augmentation (MH-Aug) that draws augmented\ngraphs from an explicit target distribution for semi-supervised learning.\nMH-Aug produces a sequence of augmented graphs from the target distribution\nenables flexible control of the strength and diversity of augmentation. Since\nthe direct sampling from the complex target distribution is challenging, we\nadopt the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to obtain the augmented samples. We\nalso propose a simple and effective semi-supervised learning strategy with\ngenerated samples from MH-Aug. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that\nMH-Aug can generate a sequence of samples according to the target distribution\nto significantly improve the performance of GNNs.",

    "title": "Self-Supervised Point Cloud Representation Learning with Occlusion  Auto-Encoder",
    "abstract": "Learning representations for point clouds is an important task in 3D computer\nvision, especially without manually annotated supervision. Previous methods\nusually take the common aid from auto-encoders to establish the\nself-supervision by reconstructing the input itself. However, the existing\nself-reconstruction based auto-encoders merely focus on the global shapes, and\nignore the hierarchical context between the local and global geometries, which\nis a crucial supervision for 3D representation learning. To resolve this issue,\nwe present a novel self-supervised point cloud representation learning\nframework, named 3D Occlusion Auto-Encoder (3D-OAE). Our key idea is to\nrandomly occlude some local patches of the input point cloud and establish the\nsupervision via recovering the occluded patches using the remaining visible\nones. Specifically, we design an encoder for learning the features of visible\nlocal patches, and a decoder for leveraging these features to predict the\noccluded patches. In contrast with previous methods, our 3D-OAE can remove a\nlarge proportion of patches and predict them only with a small number of\nvisible patches, which enable us to significantly accelerate training and yield\na nontrivial self-supervisory performance. The trained encoder can be further\ntransferred to various downstream tasks. We demonstrate our superior\nperformances over the state-of-the-art methods in different discriminant and\ngenerative applications under widely used benchmarks.",

The proposed algorithm is based on\nthe key observation that NIR edge features are more prominent in the hazy\nregions of the image than the RGB edge features in those same regions. To\ncombine the color and edge information, we introduce a haze-weight map which\nproportionately distributes the color and edge information during the fusion\nprocess. Because NIR images are, intrinsically, nearly haze-free, our work\nmakes no assumptions like existing works that rely on a scattering model and\nessentially designing a depth-independent method. This helps in minimizing\nartifacts and gives a more realistic sense to the restored haze-free image.\nExtensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm is both qualitatively\nand quantitatively better on several key metrics when compared to existing\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

A contrasting\napproach, distributed data analytics, where code and models for training and\ninference are distributed to the places where data is collected, has been\nboosted by two recent, ongoing developments: increased processing power and\nmemory capacity available in user devices at the edge of the network, such as\nsmartphones and home assistants; and increased sensitivity to the highly\nintrusive nature of many of these devices and services and the attendant\ndemands for improved privacy.

However,\napplying FL in practice is challenging due to the local devices' heterogeneous\nenergy, wireless channel conditions, and non-independently and identically\ndistributed (non-IID) data distributions. To cope with these issues, this paper\nproposes a novel learning framework by integrating FL and width-adjustable\nslimmable neural networks (SNN). Integrating FL with SNNs is challenging due to\ntime-varing channel conditions and data distributions. In addition, existing\nmulti-width SNN training algorithms are sensitive to the data distributions\nacross devices, which makes SNN ill-suited for FL. Motivated by this, we\npropose a communication and energy-efficient SNN-based FL (named SlimFL) that\njointly utilizes superposition coding (SC) for global model aggregation and\nsuperposition training (ST) for updating local models. By applying SC, SlimFL\nexchanges the superposition of multiple width configurations decoded as many\ntimes as possible for a given communication throughput. Leveraging ST, SlimFL\naligns the forward propagation of different width configurations while avoiding\ninter-width interference during backpropagation. We formally prove the\nconvergence of SlimFL.

In this paper, we propose a prompt-based framework,\nBridge-Prompt (Br-Prompt), to model the semantics across adjacent actions, so\nthat it simultaneously exploits both out-of-context and contextual information\nfrom a series of ordinal actions in instructional videos. More specifically, we\nreformulate the individual action labels as integrated text prompts for\nsupervision, which bridge the gap between individual action semantics. The\ngenerated text prompts are paired with corresponding video clips, and together\nco-train the text encoder and the video encoder via a contrastive approach. The\nlearned vision encoder has a stronger capability for ordinal-action-related\ndownstream tasks, e.g. action segmentation and human activity recognition. We\nevaluate the performances of our approach on several video datasets: Georgia\nTech Egocentric Activities (GTEA), 50Salads, and the Breakfast dataset.\nBr-Prompt achieves state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks.

Since data is always\nobtained in discrete-time, in this paper, we propose a purely data-driven\napproach for the design of a stabilizing feedback control law for a general\nclass of discrete-time control-affine non-linear systems. In particular, we use\nthe Koopman operator to lift a control-affine system to a higher-dimensional\nspace, where the control system's evolution is bilinear. We analyze the\ncontrollability of the lifted bilinear system and relate it to the\ncontrollability of the underlying non-linear system. We then leverage the\nconcept of Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) to design a state feedback law that\nstabilizes the origin.

Various works were proposed to employ\nprogressive local or global fusion, but the feature fusions are not rich enough\nfor modeling multi-scale context features. In this work, we focus on fusing\nmulti-scale features from Transformer-based backbones for semantic\nsegmentation, and propose a Feature Selective Transformer (FeSeFormer), which\naggregates features from all scales (or levels) for each query feature.\nSpecifically, we first propose a Scale-level Feature Selection (SFS) module,\nwhich can choose an informative subset from the whole multi-scale feature set\nfor each scale, where those features that are important for the current scale\n(or level) are selected and the redundant are discarded. Furthermore, we\npropose a Full-scale Feature Fusion (FFF) module, which can adaptively fuse\nfeatures of all scales for queries. Based on the proposed SFS and FFF modules,\nwe develop a Feature Selective Transformer (FeSeFormer), and evaluate our\nFeSeFormer on four challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks, including\nPASCAL Context, ADE20K, COCO-Stuff 10K, and Cityscapes, outperforming the\nstate-of-the-art.",

In this paper, we investigate the\nbehavior of no-regret learning in min-max games with dependent strategy sets,\nwhere the strategy of the first player constrains the behavior of the second.\nSuch games are best understood as sequential, i.e., min-max Stackelberg, games.\nWe consider two settings, one in which only the first player chooses their\nactions using a no-regret algorithm while the second player best responds, and\none in which both players use no-regret algorithms. For the former case, we\nshow that no-regret dynamics converge to a Stackelberg equilibrium. For the\nlatter case, we introduce a new type of regret, which we call Lagrangian\nregret, and show that if both players minimize their Lagrangian regrets, then\nplay converges to a Stackelberg equilibrium. We then observe that online mirror\ndescent (OMD) dynamics in these two settings correspond respectively to a known\nnested (i.e., sequential) gradient descent-ascent (GDA) algorithm and a new\nsimultaneous GDA-like algorithm, thereby establishing convergence of these\nalgorithms to Stackelberg equilibrium. Finally, we analyze the robustness of\nOMD dynamics to perturbations by investigating online min-max Stackelberg\ngames. We prove that OMD dynamics are robust for a large class of online\nmin-max games with independent strategy sets. In the dependent case, we\ndemonstrate the robustness of OMD dynamics experimentally by simulating them in\nonline Fisher markets, a canonical example of a min-max Stackelberg game with\ndependent strategy sets.",

Stringent guidelines and\nCOVID-19 screening measures such as temperature check and mask check at all\npublic places are helping reduce the spread of COVID-19. Visual inspections to\nensure these screening measures can be taxing and erroneous. Automated\ninspection ensures an effective and accurate screening. Traditional approaches\ninvolve identification of faces and masks from visual camera images followed by\nextraction of temperature values from thermal imaging cameras. Use of visual\nimaging as a primary modality limits these applications only for good-lighting\nconditions. The use of thermal imaging alone for these screening measures makes\nthe system invariant to illumination. However, lack of open source datasets is\nan issue to develop such systems. In this paper, we discuss our work on using\nmachine learning over thermal video streams for face and mask detection and\nsubsequent temperature screening in a passive non-invasive way that enables an\neffective automated COVID-19 screening method in public places. We open source\nour NTIC dataset that was used for training our models and was collected at 8\ndifferent locations.

    "abstract": "Databases for OLTP are often the backbone for applications such as hotel room\nor cinema ticket booking applications. However, developing a conversational\nagent (i.e., a chatbot-like interface) to allow end-users to interact with an\napplication using natural language requires both immense amounts of training\ndata and NLP expertise. This motivates CAT, which can be used to easily create\nconversational agents for transactional databases. The main idea is that, for a\ngiven OLTP database, CAT uses weak supervision to synthesize the required\ntraining data to train a state-of-the-art conversational agent, allowing users\nto interact with the OLTP database. Furthermore, CAT provides an out-of-the-box\nintegration of the resulting agent with the database. As a major difference to\nexisting conversational agents, agents synthesized by CAT are data-aware. This\nmeans that the agent decides which information should be requested from the\nuser based on the current data distributions in the database, which typically\nresults in markedly more efficient dialogues compared with non-data-aware\nagents. We publish the code for CAT as open source.",

    "abstract": "It has been well recognized that neural network based image classifiers are\neasily fooled by images with tiny perturbations crafted by an adversary. There\nhas been a vast volume of research to generate and defend such adversarial\nattacks. However, the following problem is left unexplored: How to\nreverse-engineer adversarial perturbations from an adversarial image? This\nleads to a new adversarial learning paradigm--Reverse Engineering of Deceptions\n(RED). If successful, RED allows us to estimate adversarial perturbations and\nrecover the original images. However, carefully crafted, tiny adversarial\nperturbations are difficult to recover by optimizing a unilateral RED\nobjective. For example, the pure image denoising method may overfit to\nminimizing the reconstruction error but hardly preserve the classification\nproperties of the true adversarial perturbations. To tackle this challenge, we\nformalize the RED problem and identify a set of principles crucial to the RED\napproach design. Particularly, we find that prediction alignment and proper\ndata augmentation (in terms of spatial transformations) are two criteria to\nachieve a generalizable RED approach. By integrating these RED principles with\nimage denoising, we propose a new Class-Discriminative Denoising based RED\nframework, termed CDD-RED. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\nof CDD-RED under different evaluation metrics (ranging from the pixel-level,\nprediction-level to the attribution-level alignment) and a variety of attack\ngeneration methods (e.g., FGSM, PGD, CW, AutoAttack, and adaptive attacks).",

In this paper, we investigate a multi-user\ncommunication system assisted by cooperative IRS devices with the capability of\nenergy harvesting. Aiming to maximize the long-term average achievable system\nrate, an optimization problem is formulated by jointly designing the transmit\nbeamforming at the base station (BS) and discrete phase shift beamforming at\nthe IRSs, with the constraints on transmit power, user data rate requirement\nand IRS energy buffer size. Considering time-varying channels and stochastic\narrivals of energy harvested by the IRSs, we first formulate the problem as a\nMarkov decision process (MDP) and then develop a novel multi-agent Q-mix (MAQ)\nframework with two layers to decouple the optimization parameters. The higher\nlayer is for optimizing phase shift resolutions, and the lower one is for phase\nshift beamforming and power allocation. Since the phase shift optimization is\nan integer programming problem with a large-scale action space, we improve MAQ\nby incorporating the Wolpertinger method, namely, MAQ-WP algorithm to achieve a\nsub-optimality with reduced dimensions of action space. In addition, as MAQ-WP\nis still of high complexity to achieve good performance, we propose a policy\ngradient-based MAQ algorithm, namely, MAQ-PG, by mapping the discrete phase\nshift actions into a continuous space at the cost of a slight performance loss.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed MAQ-WP and MAQ-PG algorithms\ncan converge faster and achieve data rate improvements of 10.7% and 8.8% over\nthe conventional multi-agent DDPG, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The lack of adversarial robustness has been recognized as an important issue\nfor state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models, e.g., deep neural networks\n(DNNs). Thereby, robustifying ML models against adversarial attacks is now a\nmajor focus of research. However, nearly all existing defense methods,\nparticularly for robust training, made the white-box assumption that the\ndefender has the access to the details of an ML model (or its surrogate\nalternatives if available), e.g., its architectures and parameters. Beyond\nexisting works, in this paper we aim to address the problem of black-box\ndefense: How to robustify a black-box model using just input queries and output\nfeedback? Such a problem arises in practical scenarios, where the owner of the\npredictive model is reluctant to share model information in order to preserve\nprivacy. To this end, we propose a general notion of defensive operation that\ncan be applied to black-box models, and design it through the lens of denoised\nsmoothing (DS), a first-order (FO) certified defense technique. To allow the\ndesign of merely using model queries, we further integrate DS with the\nzeroth-order (gradient-free) optimization. However, a direct implementation of\nzeroth-order (ZO) optimization suffers a high variance of gradient estimates,\nand thus leads to ineffective defense. To tackle this problem, we next propose\nto prepend an autoencoder (AE) to a given (black-box) model so that DS can be\ntrained using variance-reduced ZO optimization. We term the eventual defense as\nZO-AE-DS. In practice, we empirically show that ZO-AE- DS can achieve improved\naccuracy, certified robustness, and query complexity over existing baselines.\nAnd the effectiveness of our approach is justified under both image\nclassification and image reconstruction tasks.

However, existing methods often ignore the\ninherent relationships of different concepts (e.g., dog and cat both belong to\nanimals), and thus lose the chance to explain neurons responsible for\nhigher-level concepts (e.g., animal). In this paper, we study hierarchical\nconcepts inspired by the hierarchical cognition process of human beings. To\nthis end, we propose HIerarchical Neuron concepT explainer (HINT) to\neffectively build bidirectional associations between neurons and hierarchical\nconcepts in a low-cost and scalable manner. HINT enables us to systematically\nand quantitatively study whether and how the implicit hierarchical\nrelationships of concepts are embedded into neurons, such as identifying\ncollaborative neurons responsible to one concept and multimodal neurons for\ndifferent concepts, at different semantic levels from concrete concepts (e.g.,\ndog) to more abstract ones (e.g., animal).

    "abstract": "In the real open world, data tends to follow long-tailed class distributions,\nmotivating the well-studied long-tailed recognition (LTR) problem. Naive\ntraining produces models that are biased toward common classes in terms of\nhigher accuracy. The key to addressing LTR is to balance various aspects\nincluding data distribution, training losses, and gradients in learning. We\nexplore an orthogonal direction, weight balancing, motivated by the empirical\nobservation that the naively trained classifier has \"artificially\" larger\nweights in norm for common classes (because there exists abundant data to train\nthem, unlike the rare classes). We investigate three techniques to balance\nweights, L2-normalization, weight decay, and MaxNorm. We first point out that\nL2-normalization \"perfectly\" balances per-class weights to be unit norm, but\nsuch a hard constraint might prevent classes from learning better classifiers.\nIn contrast, weight decay penalizes larger weights more heavily and so learns\nsmall balanced weights; the MaxNorm constraint encourages growing small weights\nwithin a norm ball but caps all the weights by the radius. Our extensive study\nshows that both help learn balanced weights and greatly improve the LTR\naccuracy. Surprisingly, weight decay, although underexplored in LTR,\nsignificantly improves over prior work. Therefore, we adopt a two-stage\ntraining paradigm and propose a simple approach to LTR: (1) learning features\nusing the cross-entropy loss by tuning weight decay, and (2) learning\nclassifiers using class-balanced loss by tuning weight decay and MaxNorm. Our\napproach achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on five standard benchmarks,\nserving as a future baseline for long-tailed recognition.",

    "abstract": "The lack of resolution has a negative impact on the performance of\nimage-based biometrics. While many generic super-resolution methods have been\nproposed to restore low-resolution images, they usually aim to enhance their\nvisual appearance. However, a visual enhancement of biometric images does not\nnecessarily correlate with a better recognition performance. Reconstruction\napproaches need thus to incorporate specific information from the target\nbiometric modality to effectively improve recognition. This paper presents a\ncomprehensive survey of iris super-resolution approaches proposed in the\nliterature. We have also adapted an Eigen-patches reconstruction method based\non PCA Eigen-transformation of local image patches. The structure of the iris\nis exploited by building a patch-position dependent dictionary. In addition,\nimage patches are restored separately, having their own reconstruction weights.\nThis allows the solution to be locally optimized, helping to preserve local\ninformation. To evaluate the algorithm, we degraded high-resolution images from\nthe CASIA Interval V3 database. Different restorations were considered, with\n15x15 pixels being the smallest resolution. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis among the smallest resolutions employed in the literature. The framework is\ncomplemented with six public iris comparators, which were used to carry out\nbiometric verification and identification experiments. Experimental results\nshow that the proposed method significantly outperforms both bilinear and\nbicubic interpolation at very low-resolution. The performance of a number of\ncomparators attains an impressive Equal Error Rate as low as 5%, and a Top-1\naccuracy of 77-84% when considering iris images of only 15x15 pixels. These\nresults clearly demonstrate the benefit of using trained super-resolution\ntechniques to improve the quality of iris images prior to matching.",

However, it is still non-trivial to\ngeneralize these object detectors to the novel long-tailed object classes,\nwhich has only few labeled training samples. To this end, the Few-Shot Object\nDetection (FSOD) has been topical recently, as it mimics the humans' ability of\nlearning to learn, and intelligently transfers the learnt generic object\nknowledge from the common heavy-tailed, to the novel long-tailed object\nclasses.

To review these FSOD works, there are several insightful FSOD survey\narticles that systematically study and compare them as the groups of\nfine-tuning/transfer learning, and meta-learning methods. In contrast, we\ncompare these FSOD algorithms from the new perspective and taxonomy of their\ncontributions, i.e., data-oriented, model-oriented, and algorithm oriented\nones. Thus, an empirical study and comparison has been conducted on the recent\nachievements of FSOD.

However, our analysis indicates that the training objectives\nfor the classifier in these methods may lead to a serious score mismatch issue,\nwhich corresponds to the situation that the estimated scores deviate from the\ntrue ones. Such an issue causes the samples to be misled by the deviated scores\nduring the diffusion process, resulting in a degraded sampling quality.

Recent work mainly utilizes features in single or\nneighboring frames for constructing metric loss and empowering networks to\nextract representation of targets. Although this strategy is effective, it\nfails to fully exploit the information contained in a whole trajectory. To this\nend, we propose a strategy, namely multi-view trajectory contrastive learning,\nin which each trajectory is represented as a center vector. By maintaining all\nthe vectors in a dynamically updated memory bank, a trajectory-level\ncontrastive loss is devised to explore the inter-frame information in the whole\ntrajectories. Besides, in this strategy, each target is represented as multiple\nadaptively selected keypoints rather than a pre-defined anchor or center. This\ndesign allows the network to generate richer representation from multiple views\nof the same target, which can better characterize occluded objects.\nAdditionally, in the inference stage, a similarity-guided feature fusion\nstrategy is developed for further boosting the quality of the trajectory\nrepresentation.

We provide a constant-pass\nstreaming algorithm for $(1\\pm \\epsilon)$-approximating $\\# K_r$ in\n$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{m\\lambda^{r-2}}{\\epsilon^2\\cdot \\# K_r})$ space for any $r\\geq\n3$, in a graph $G$ with degeneracy $\\lambda$, where $K_r$ is a clique on $r$\nvertices. This resolves a conjecture by Bera and Seshadhri [PODS 2020]. More\ngenerally, our reduction relates the adaptivity of a query algorithm to the\npass complexity of a corresponding streaming algorithm, and it is applicable to\nall algorithms in standard sublinear-time graph query models, e.g., the\n(augmented) general model.",

In this paper, we propose a\nconceptual framework for data labeling and OneLabeler based on the conceptual\nframework to support easy building of labeling tools for diverse usage\nscenarios. The framework consists of common modules and states in labeling\ntools summarized through coding of existing tools. OneLabeler supports\nconfiguration and composition of common software modules through visual\nprogramming to build data labeling tools.

    "abstract": "Domain generalization (DG) is essentially an out-of-distribution problem,\naiming to generalize the knowledge learned from multiple source domains to an\nunseen target domain. The mainstream is to leverage statistical models to model\nthe dependence between data and labels, intending to learn representations\nindependent of domain. Nevertheless, the statistical models are superficial\ndescriptions of reality since they are only required to model dependence\ninstead of the intrinsic causal mechanism. When the dependence changes with the\ntarget distribution, the statistic models may fail to generalize. In this\nregard, we introduce a general structural causal model to formalize the DG\nproblem. Specifically, we assume that each input is constructed from a mix of\ncausal factors (whose relationship with the label is invariant across domains)\nand non-causal factors (category-independent), and only the former cause the\nclassification judgments. Our goal is to extract the causal factors from inputs\nand then reconstruct the invariant causal mechanisms. However, the theoretical\nidea is far from practical of DG since the required causal/non-causal factors\nare unobserved. We highlight that ideal causal factors should meet three basic\nproperties: separated from the non-causal ones, jointly independent, and\ncausally sufficient for the classification. Based on that, we propose a\nCausality Inspired Representation Learning (CIRL) algorithm that enforces the\nrepresentations to satisfy the above properties and then uses them to simulate\nthe causal factors, which yields improved generalization ability.

    "abstract": "With the widespread diffusion of smartphones, Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC),\nwhich aims to assign spatial tasks to mobile workers, has drawn increasing\nattention in both academia and industry. One of the major issues is how to best\nassign tasks to workers. Given a worker and a task, the worker will choose to\naccept the task based on her affinity towards the task, and the worker can\npropagate the information of the task to attract more workers to perform it.\nThese factors can be measured as worker-task influence. Since workers'\naffinities towards tasks are different and task issuers may ask workers who\nperformed tasks to propagate the information of tasks to attract more workers\nto perform them, it is important to analyze worker-task influence when making\nassignments. We propose and solve a novel influence-aware task assignment\nproblem in SC, where tasks are assigned to workers in a manner that achieves\nhigh worker-task influence. In particular, we aim to maximize the number of\nassigned tasks and worker-task influence. To solve the problem, we first\ndetermine workers' affinities towards tasks by identifying workers' historical\ntask-performing patterns. Next, a Historical Acceptance approach is developed\nto measure workers' willingness of performing a task, i.e., the probability of\nworkers visiting the location of the task when they are informed. Next, we\npropose a Random reverse reachable-based Propagation Optimization algorithm\nthat exploits reverse reachable sets to calculate the probability of workers\nbeing informed about tasks in a social network. Based on worker-task influence\nderived from the above three factors, we propose three influence-aware task\nassignment algorithms that aim to maximize the number of assigned tasks and\nworker-task influence.

Unlike the classical MIMO composed of discrete\nantennas, CAP-MIMO has a continuous antenna surface, which is expected to\ngenerate any current distribution (i.e., pattern) and induce controllable\nspatial electromagnetic waves. In this way, the information can be modulated on\nthe electromagnetic waves, which makes it promising to approach the ultimate\ncapacity of finite apertures. The pattern design for CAP-MIMO is the key factor\nto determine the communication performance, but it has not been well studied in\nthe literature.

    "title": "Safe Hierarchical Model Predictive Control and Planning for Autonomous  Systems",
    "abstract": "Planning and control for autonomous vehicles usually are hierarchical\nseparated. However, increasing performance demands and operating in highly\ndynamic environments requires an frequent re-evaluation of the planning and\ntight integration of control and planning to guarantee safety. We propose an\nintegrated hierarchical predictive control and planning approach to tackle this\nchallenge. Planner and controller are based on the repeated solution of moving\nhorizon optimal control problems. The planner can choose different low-layer\ncontroller modes for increased flexibility and performance instead of using a\nsingle controller with a large safety margin for collision avoidance under\nuncertainty. Planning is based on simplified system dynamics and safety, yet\nflexible operation is ensured by constraint tightening based on a mixed-integer\nlinear programming formulation. A cyclic horizon tube-based model predictive\ncontroller guarantees constraint satisfaction for different control modes and\ndisturbances. Examples of such modes are a slow-speed movement with high\nprecision and fast-speed movements with large uncertainty bounds. Allowing for\ndifferent control modes reduces the conservatism, while the hierarchical\ndecomposition of the problem reduces the computational cost and enables\nreal-time implementation. We derive conditions for recursive feasibility to\nensure constraint satisfaction and obstacle avoidance to guarantee safety and\nensure compatibility between the layers and modes. Simulation results\nillustrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed hierarchical\nstrategy.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive understanding of human-object interaction (HOI) requires\ndetecting not only a small portion of predefined HOI concepts (or categories)\nbut also other reasonable HOI concepts, while current approaches usually fail\nto explore a huge portion of unknown HOI concepts (i.e., unknown but reasonable\ncombinations of verbs and objects). In this paper, 1) we introduce a novel and\nchallenging task for a comprehensive HOI understanding, which is termed as HOI\nConcept Discovery; and 2) we devise a self-compositional learning framework (or\nSCL) for HOI concept discovery. Specifically, we maintain an online updated\nconcept confidence matrix during training: 1) we assign pseudo-labels for all\ncomposite HOI instances according to the concept confidence matrix for\nself-training; and 2) we update the concept confidence matrix using the\npredictions of all composite HOI instances. Therefore, the proposed method\nenables the learning on both known and unknown HOI concepts. We perform\nextensive experiments on several popular HOI datasets to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method for HOI concept discovery, object\naffordance recognition and HOI detection. For example, the proposed\nself-compositional learning framework significantly improves the performance of\n1) HOI concept discovery by over 10% on HICO-DET and over 3% on V-COCO,\nrespectively; 2) object affordance recognition by over 9% mAP on MS-COCO and\nHICO-DET; and 3) rare-first and non-rare-first unknown HOI detection relatively\nover 30% and 20%, respectively.

To\neffectively learn the AST hierarchy, we use contrastive learning to allow the\nnetwork to predict the AST node level and learn the hierarchical relationships\nbetween nodes in a self-supervised manner, which makes the representation\nvectors of nodes with greater differences in AST levels farther apart in the\nembedding space. By using such vectors, the structural similarities between\ncode snippets can be measured more precisely. In the learning process, a novel\nGNN (called Residual Self-attention Graph Neural Network, RSGNN) is designed,\nwhich enables HELoC to focus on embedding the local structure of an AST while\ncapturing its overall structure.

Therefore, much research has\nfocused on using DRs collaboratively by forming ensembles. In this paper, a\nnovel ensemble collaboration method for dynamic scheduling is proposed.

Based on these\nsimulations, it is determined which DR makes the best decision and that\ndecision is applied.

Its core is a\ndifferentiable optimisation layer that operates on a learned affinity graph.\nThe learned graph potentials make it possible to leverage rich contextual\ninformation from the guide image, while the explicit graph optimisation within\nthe architecture guarantees rigorous fidelity of the high-resolution target to\nthe low-resolution source. With the decision to employ the source as a\nconstraint rather than only as an input to the prediction, our method differs\nfrom state-of-the-art deep architectures for guided super-resolution, which\nproduce targets that, when downsampled, will only approximately reproduce the\nsource. This is not only theoretically appealing, but also produces crisper,\nmore natural-looking images. A key property of our method is that, although the\ngraph connectivity is restricted to the pixel lattice, the associated edge\npotentials are learned with a deep feature extractor and can encode rich\ncontext information over large receptive fields. By taking advantage of the\nsparse graph connectivity, it becomes possible to propagate gradients through\nthe optimisation layer and learn the edge potentials from data. We extensively\nevaluate our method on several datasets, and consistently outperform recent\nbaselines in terms of quantitative reconstruction errors, while also delivering\nvisually sharper outputs.

A natural way to solve this problem is to separate it into\ndetection and unsupervised re-identification (Re-ID) steps.

Key to our approach is the use of both global\nand local temporal constraints. The objective of the global constraint is to\nlearn consistent linear classifiers for novel classes across the image\nsequence, whereas the local constraint enforces the proportion of\nforeground/background regions in each frame to be coherent across a local\ntemporal window. These constraints act as spatiotemporal regularizers during\nthe transductive inference to increase temporal coherence and reduce\noverfitting on the few-shot support set.

When K is unknown, however, using model-selection\ncriteria to choose its optimal value might become computationally expensive,\nespecially in DL as the training process would have to be repeated numerous\ntimes. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an effective\ndeep-clustering method that does not require knowing the value of K as it\ninfers it during the learning. Using a split/merge framework, a dynamic\narchitecture that adapts to the changing K, and a novel loss, our proposed\nmethod outperforms existing nonparametric methods (both classical and deep\nones). While the very few existing deep nonparametric methods lack scalability,\nwe demonstrate ours by being the first to report the performance of such a\nmethod on ImageNet.

Then, building on the\nideas used for the case of one machine, we design a sublinear solution for any\nconstant number of machines: we describe a structure for Dynamic Interval\nScheduling on $m\\geq 2$ machines with amortized $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{1 -\n1/m})$ update time.\nWe complement the above results by considering Dynamic Weighted Interval\nScheduling on one machine, that is maintaining (the weight of) the maximum\nweight subset of pairwise disjoint intervals. We show an almost linear lower\nbound (conditioned on the hardness of Minimum Weight $k$-Clique) for the\nupdate/query time of any structure for this problem. Hence, in the weighted\ncase one should indeed seek approximate solutions.",

    "abstract": "The past year has witnessed a rapid development of masked image modeling\n(MIM). MIM is mostly built upon the vision transformers, which suggests that\nself-supervised visual representations can be done by masking input image parts\nwhile requiring the target model to recover the missing contents. MIM has\ndemonstrated promising results on downstream tasks, yet we are interested in\nwhether there exist other effective ways to `learn by recovering missing\ncontents'. In this paper, we investigate this topic by designing five other\nlearning objectives that follow the same procedure as MIM but degrade the input\nimage in different ways. With extensive experiments, we manage to summarize a\nfew design principles for token-based pre-training of vision transformers. In\nparticular, the best practice is obtained by keeping the original image style\nand enriching spatial masking with spatial misalignment -- this design achieves\nsuperior performance over MIM in a series of downstream recognition tasks\nwithout extra computational cost.

In this paper, we aim to utilize\nlow-confidence samples in a novel way with our proposed mutex-based consistency\nregularization, namely MutexMatch. Specifically, the high-confidence samples\nare required to exactly predict \"what it is\" by conventional True-Positive\nClassifier, while the low-confidence samples are employed to achieve a simpler\ngoal -- to predict with ease \"what it is not\" by True-Negative Classifier. In\nthis sense, we not only mitigate the pseudo-labeling errors but also make full\nuse of the low-confidence unlabeled data by consistency of dissimilarity\ndegree. MutexMatch achieves superior performance on multiple benchmark\ndatasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, STL-10, and mini-ImageNet. More\nimportantly, our method further shows superiority when the amount of labeled\ndata is scarce, e.g., 92.23% accuracy with only 20 labeled data on CIFAR-10.\nCode has been released at https://github.com/NJUyued/MutexMatch4SSL.",

    "abstract": "In light of the growing number of user privacy violations in centralized\nsocial networks, the need to define effective platforms for decentralized\nonline social networks (DOSNs) is deeply felt. Interesting solutions have been\nproposed in the past, which own the necessary mechanisms to allow users keeping\ncontrol over their personal information and setting the rules to regulate the\naccess of other users. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of this type of\nsolutions is severely reduced by the fact that different user communities with\na shared interest could be disconnected/separated from each other. This\ntranslates into a reduced ability in effectively spreading data of common\ninterest towards all interested users, as it currently happens in centralized\nsocial networks. In order to overcome the cited limitation, this paper proposes\na disruptive approach, which exploits the availability of a new class of\nInternet of Things (IoT) devices with autonomous social behaviors and cognitive\nabilities. Such devices can be leveraged as friendship intermediaries between\ndevices' owners who are connected to a DOSN platform and share the same\ninterest. We will demonstrate that clear advantages can be achieved in terms of\nincreased percentage of Interested Reachable Nodes (a specific measure of\nDelivery Ratio) in distributed social networks among humans, when enhanced with\nso called Mediator Objects adhering to the well-known social IoT (SIoT)\nparadigm.",

    "abstract": "Face anti-spoofing (FAS) plays a critical role in securing face recognition\nsystems from different presentation attacks. Previous works leverage auxiliary\npixel-level supervision and domain generalization approaches to address unseen\nspoof types. However, the local characteristics of image captures, i.e.,\ncapturing devices and presenting materials, are ignored in existing works and\nwe argue that such information is required for networks to discriminate between\nlive and spoof images. In this work, we propose PatchNet which reformulates\nface anti-spoofing as a fine-grained patch-type recognition problem. To be\nspecific, our framework recognizes the combination of capturing devices and\npresenting materials based on the patches cropped from non-distorted face\nimages. This reformulation can largely improve the data variation and enforce\nthe network to learn discriminative feature from local capture patterns. In\naddition, to further improve the generalization ability of the spoof feature,\nwe propose the novel Asymmetric Margin-based Classification Loss and\nSelf-supervised Similarity Loss to regularize the patch embedding space. Our\nexperimental results verify our assumption and show that the model is capable\nof recognizing unseen spoof types robustly by only looking at local regions.\nMoreover, the fine-grained and patch-level reformulation of FAS outperforms the\nexisting approaches on intra-dataset, cross-dataset, and domain generalization\nbenchmarks. Furthermore, our PatchNet framework can enable practical\napplications like Few-Shot Reference-based FAS and facilitate future\nexploration of spoof-related intrinsic cues.",

However, such hierarchical reasoning ability of human\nperception remains largely unexplored in current literature of semantic\nsegmentation. Existing work is often aware of flatten labels and predicts\ntarget classes exclusively for each pixel. In this paper, we instead address\nhierarchical semantic segmentation (HSS), which aims at structured, pixel-wise\ndescription of visual observation in terms of a class hierarchy. We devise\nHSSN, a general HSS framework that tackles two critical issues in this task: i)\nhow to efficiently adapt existing hierarchy-agnostic segmentation networks to\nthe HSS setting, and ii) how to leverage the hierarchy information to\nregularize HSS network learning. To address i), HSSN directly casts HSS as a\npixel-wise multi-label classification task, only bringing minimal architecture\nchange to current segmentation models. To solve ii), HSSN first explores\ninherent properties of the hierarchy as a training objective, which enforces\nsegmentation predictions to obey the hierarchy structure. Further, with\nhierarchy-induced margin constraints, HSSN reshapes the pixel embedding space,\nso as to generate well-structured pixel representations and improve\nsegmentation eventually.

    "abstract": "Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has rapidly progressed with the development of\nobject detection and re-identification. However, motion modeling, which\nfacilitates object association by forecasting short-term trajectories with past\nobservations, has been relatively under-explored in recent years. Current\nmotion models in MOT typically assume that the object motion is linear in a\nsmall time window and needs continuous observations, so these methods are\nsensitive to occlusions and non-linear motion and require high frame-rate\nvideos. In this work, we show that a simple motion model can obtain\nstate-of-the-art tracking performance without other cues like appearance. We\nemphasize the role of \"observation\" when recovering tracks from being lost and\nreducing the error accumulated by linear motion models during the lost period.\nWe thus name the proposed method as Observation-Centric SORT, OC-SORT for\nshort. It remains simple, online, and real-time but improves robustness over\nocclusion and non-linear motion. It achieves 63.2 and 62.1 HOTA on MOT17 and\nMOT20, respectively, surpassing all published methods. It also sets new states\nof the art on KITTI Pedestrian Tracking and DanceTrack where the object motion\nis highly non-linear.

    "abstract": "Given the massive growth in the volume of spatial data, there is a great need\nfor systems that can efficiently evaluate spatial queries over large data sets.\nThese queries are notoriously expensive using traditional database solutions.\nWhile faster response times can be attained through powerful clusters or\nservers with large main-memory, these options, due to cost and complexity, are\nout of reach to many data scientists and analysts making up the long tail.\nGraphics Processing Units (GPUs), which are now widely available even in\ncommodity desktops and laptops, provide a cost-effective alternative to support\nhigh-performance computing, opening up new opportunities to the efficient\nevaluation of spatial queries. While GPU-based approaches proposed in the\nliterature have shown great improvements in performance, they are tied to\nspecific GPU hardware and only handle specific queries over fixed geometry\ntypes.\nIn this paper we present SPADE, a GPU-powered spatial database engine that\nsupports a rich set of spatial queries. We discuss the challenges involved in\nattaining efficient query evaluation over large datasets as well as portability\nacross different GPU hardware, and how these are addressed in SPADE. We\nperformed a detailed experimental evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the\nsystem for wide range of queries and datasets, and report results which show\nthat SPADE is scalable and able to handle data larger than main-memory, and its\nperformance on a laptop is on par with that other systems that require clusters\nor large-memory servers.",

    "abstract": "While numerous studies have been conducted in the literature exploring\ndifferent types of machine learning approaches for search ranking, most of them\nare focused on specific pre-defined problems but only a few of them have\nstudied the ranking framework which can be applied in a commercial search\nengine in a scalable way. In the meantime, existing ranking models are often\noptimized for normalized discounted cumulative gains (NDCG) or online\nclick-through rate (CTR), and both types of machine learning models are built\nbased on the assumption that high-quality training data can be easily obtained\nand well applied to unseen cases. In practice at Facebook search, we observed\nthat our training data for ML models have certain issues. First, tail query\nintents are hardly covered in our human rating dataset. Second, search click\nlogs are often noisy and hard to clean up due to various reasons. To address\nthe above issues, in this paper, we propose a probabilistic intent based\nranking framework (short for piRank), which can: 1) provide a scalable\nframework to address various ranking issues for different query intents in a\ndivide-and-conquer way; 2) improve system development agility including\niteration speed and system debuggability; 3) combine both machine learning and\nempirical-based algorithmic methods in a systematic way.

    "abstract": "We investigate S-boxes defined by pairs of Orthogonal Cellular Automata\n(OCA), motivated by the fact that such CA always define bijective vectorial\nBoolean functions, and could thus be interesting for the design of block\nciphers. In particular, we perform an exhaustive search of all nonlinear OCA\npairs of diameter $d=4$ and $d=5$, which generate S-boxes of size $6\\times 6$\nand $8\\times 8$, respectively. Surprisingly, all these S-boxes turn out to be\nlinear, and thus they are not useful for the design of confusion layers in\nblock ciphers. However, a closer inspection of these S-boxes reveals a very\ninteresting structure. Indeed, we remark that the linear components space of\nthe OCA-based S-boxes found by our exhaustive search are themselves the kernels\nof linear CA, or, equivalently, \\emph{polynomial codes}. We finally classify\nthe polynomial codes of the S-boxes obtained in our exhaustive search and\nobserve that, in most cases, they actually correspond to the cyclic code with\ngenerator polynomial $X^{b}+1$, where $b=d-1$. Although these findings rule out\nthe possibility of using OCA to design good S-boxes in block ciphers, they give\nnonetheless some interesting insights for a theoretical characterization of\nnonlinear OCA pairs, which is still an open question in general.",

Recent works attempt to perform motion transfer\non arbitrary objects through unsupervised methods without using a priori\nknowledge. However, it remains a significant challenge for current unsupervised\nmethods when there is a large pose gap between the objects in the source and\ndriving images. In this paper, a new end-to-end unsupervised motion transfer\nframework is proposed to overcome such issue. Firstly, we propose thin-plate\nspline motion estimation to produce a more flexible optical flow, which warps\nthe feature maps of the source image to the feature domain of the driving\nimage. Secondly, in order to restore the missing regions more realistically, we\nleverage multi-resolution occlusion masks to achieve more effective feature\nfusion. Finally, additional auxiliary loss functions are designed to ensure\nthat there is a clear division of labor in the network modules, encouraging the\nnetwork to generate high-quality images. Our method can animate a variety of\nobjects, including talking faces, human bodies, and pixel animations.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method performs better on most benchmarks than\nthe state of the art with visible improvements in pose-related metrics.",

What are\nthe consequences of constructive separations? We build a case that\n\"constructiveness\" serves as a dividing line between many weak lower bounds we\nknow how to prove, and strong lower bounds against $P$, $ZPP$, and $BPP$. Put\nanother way, constructiveness is the opposite of a complexity barrier: it is a\nproperty we want lower bounds to have. Our results fall into three broad\ncategories.\n1. Our first set of results shows that, for many well-known lower bounds\nagainst streaming algorithms, one-tape Turing machines, and query complexity,\nas well as lower bounds for the Minimum Circuit Size Problem, making these\nlower bounds constructive would imply breakthrough separations ranging from\n$EXP \\neq BPP$ to even $P \\neq NP$.\n2. Our second set of results shows that for most major open problems in lower\nbounds against $P$, $ZPP$, and $BPP$, including $P \\neq NP$, $P \\neq PSPACE$,\n$P \\neq PP$, $ZPP \\neq EXP$, and $BPP \\neq NEXP$, any proof of the separation\nwould further imply a constructive separation.

Our third set of results shows that certain complexity separations cannot\nbe made constructive.

    "abstract": "Neural volume rendering has been proven to be a promising method for\nefficient and photo-realistic rendering of a human performer in free-view, a\ncritical task in many immersive VR/AR applications. However, existing\napproaches are severely limited by their high computational cost in the\nrendering process. To solve this problem, we propose the UV Volumes, an\napproach that can render an editable free-view video of a human performer in\nreal-time. It is achieved by removing the high-frequency (i.e., non-smooth)\nhuman textures from the 3D volume and encoding them into a 2D neural texture\nstack (NTS). The smooth UV volume allows us to employ a much smaller and\nshallower structure for 3D CNN and MLP, to obtain the density and texture\ncoordinates without losing image details. Meanwhile, the NTS only needs to be\nqueried once for each pixel in the UV image to retrieve its RGB value. For\neditability, the 3D CNN and MLP decoder can easily fit the function that maps\nthe input structured-and-posed latent codes to the relatively smooth densities\nand texture coordinates.

    "abstract": "Modern code review is a widely used technique employed in both industrial and\nopen-source projects to improve software quality, share knowledge, and ensure\nadherence to coding standards and guidelines. During code review, developers\nmay discuss refactoring activities before merging code changes in the code\nbase. To date, code review has been extensively studied to explore its general\nchallenges, best practices and outcomes, and socio-technical aspects. However,\nlittle is known about how refactoring is being reviewed and what developers\ncare about when they review refactored code. Hence, in this work, we present a\nquantitative and qualitative study to understand what are the main criteria\ndevelopers rely on to develop a decision about accepting or rejecting a\nsubmitted refactored code, and what makes this process challenging. Through a\ncase study of 11,010 refactoring and non-refactoring reviews spread across\nOpenStack open-source projects, we find that refactoring-related code reviews\ntake significantly longer to be resolved in terms of code review efforts.\nMoreover, upon performing a thematic analysis on a significant sample of the\nrefactoring code review discussions, we built a comprehensive taxonomy\nconsisting of 28 refactoring review criteria. We envision our findings\nreaffirming the necessity of developing accurate and efficient tools and\ntechniques that can assist developers in the review process in the presence of\nrefactorings.",

    "abstract": "In self-supervised learning, multi-granular features are heavily desired\nthough rarely investigated, as different downstream tasks (e.g., general and\nfine-grained classification) often require different or multi-granular\nfeatures, e.g.~fine- or coarse-grained one or their mixture. In this work, for\nthe first time, we propose an effective MUlti-Granular Self-supervised learning\n(Mugs) framework to explicitly learn multi-granular visual features. Mugs has\nthree complementary granular supervisions: 1) an instance discrimination\nsupervision (IDS), 2) a novel local-group discrimination supervision (LGDS),\nand 3) a group discrimination supervision (GDS). IDS distinguishes different\ninstances to learn instance-level fine-grained features. LGDS aggregates\nfeatures of an image and its neighbors into a local-group feature, and pulls\nlocal-group features from different crops of the same image together and push\nthem away for others. It provides complementary instance supervision to IDS via\nan extra alignment on local neighbors, and scatters different local-groups\nseparately to increase discriminability. Accordingly, it helps learn high-level\nfine-grained features at a local-group level. Finally, to prevent similar\nlocal-groups from being scattered randomly or far away, GDS brings similar\nsamples close and thus pulls similar local-groups together, capturing\ncoarse-grained features at a (semantic) group level. Consequently, Mugs can\ncapture three granular features that often enjoy higher generality on diverse\ndownstream tasks over single-granular features, e.g.~instance-level\nfine-grained features in contrastive learning. By only pretraining on\nImageNet-1K, Mugs sets new SoTA linear probing accuracy 82.1$\\%$ on ImageNet-1K\nand improves previous SoTA by $1.1\\%$.

Although object detection has a broad range of applications, mAP\nevaluates detectors in terms of the performance of ranked instance retrieval.\nSuch the assumption for the evaluation task does not suit some downstream\ntasks. To alleviate the gap between downstream tasks and the evaluation\nscenario, we propose Optimal Correction Cost (OC-cost), which assesses\ndetection accuracy at image level. OC-cost computes the cost of correcting\ndetections to ground truths as a measure of accuracy. The cost is obtained by\nsolving an optimal transportation problem between the detections and the ground\ntruths. Unlike mAP, OC-cost is designed to penalize false positive and false\nnegative detections properly, and every image in a dataset is treated equally.\nOur experimental result validates that OC-cost has better agreement with human\npreference than a ranking-based measure, i.e., mAP for a single image. We also\nshow that detectors' rankings by OC-cost are more consistent on different data\nsplits than mAP. Our goal is not to replace mAP with OC-cost but provide an\nadditional tool to evaluate detectors from another aspect.

    "abstract": "This paper probes intrinsic factors behind typical failure cases (e.g.\nspatial inconsistency and boundary confusion) produced by the existing\nstate-of-the-art method in face parsing. To tackle these problems, we propose a\nnovel Decoupled Multi-task Learning with Cyclical Self-Regulation (DML-CSR) for\nface parsing. Specifically, DML-CSR designs a multi-task model which comprises\nface parsing, binary edge, and category edge detection. These tasks only share\nlow-level encoder weights without high-level interactions between each other,\nenabling to decouple auxiliary modules from the whole network at the inference\nstage. To address spatial inconsistency, we develop a dynamic dual graph\nconvolutional network to capture global contextual information without using\nany extra pooling operation. To handle boundary confusion in both single and\nmultiple face scenarios, we exploit binary and category edge detection to\njointly obtain generic geometric structure and fine-grained semantic clues of\nhuman faces. Besides, to prevent noisy labels from degrading model\ngeneralization during training, cyclical self-regulation is proposed to\nself-ensemble several model instances to get a new model and the resulting\nmodel then is used to self-distill subsequent models, through alternating\niterations.

Firstly, we propose a second order spatial compatibility (SC^2)\nmeasure to compute the similarity between correspondences. It considers the\nglobal compatibility instead of local consistency, allowing for more\ndistinctive clustering between inliers and outliers at early stage. Based on\nthis measure, our registration pipeline employs a global spectral technique to\nfind some reliable seeds from the initial correspondences. Then we design a\ntwo-stage strategy to expand each seed to a consensus set based on the SC^2\nmeasure matrix. Finally, we feed each consensus set to a weighted SVD algorithm\nto generate a candidate rigid transformation and select the best model as the\nfinal result. Our method can guarantee to find a certain number of outlier-free\nconsensus sets using fewer samplings, making the model estimation more\nefficient and robust.

Based on this, some methods mainly adjust the weights of hard samples\nin training stage to improve the feature discrimination. However, these methods\noverlook the feature distribution property which may lead to better results\nsince the miss-classified hard samples may be corrected by using the\ndistribution metric. This paper proposes the hard samples guided optimal\ntransport (OT) loss for deep face representation, OTFace for short. OTFace aims\nto enhance the performance of hard samples by introducing the feature\ndistribution discrepancy while maintain the performance on easy samples.\nSpecifically, we embrace triplet scheme to indicate hard sample groups in one\nmini-batch during training. OT is then used to characterize the distribution\ndifferences of features from the high level convolutional layer. Finally, we\nintegrate the margin-based-softmax (e.g. ArcFace or AM-Softmax) and OT to guide\ndeep CNN learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on several benchmark\ndatabases. The quantitative results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed\nOTFace over state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper is a technical report to share our experience and findings\nbuilding a Korean and English bilingual multimodal model. While many of the\nmultimodal datasets focus on English and multilingual multimodal research uses\nmachine-translated texts, employing such machine-translated texts is limited to\ndescribing unique expressions, cultural information, and proper noun in\nlanguages other than English. In this work, we collect 1.1 billion image-text\npairs (708 million Korean and 476 million English) and train a bilingual\nmultimodal model named KELIP. We introduce simple yet effective training\nschemes, including MAE pre-training and multi-crop augmentation.

Moreover, we discuss\nmultimodal-related research questions: 1) strong augmentation-based methods can\ndistract the model from learning proper multimodal relations; 2) training\nmultimodal model without cross-lingual relation can learn the relation via\nvisual semantics; 3) our bilingual KELIP can capture cultural differences of\nvisual semantics for the same meaning of words; 4) a large-scale multimodal\nmodel can be used for multimodal feature analogy.

However, inducing language model rationale generation\ncurrently requires either constructing massive rationale datasets or\nsacrificing accuracy by using only few-shot inference. We propose a technique\nto iteratively leverage a small number of rationale examples and a large\ndataset without rationales, to bootstrap the ability to perform successively\nmore complex reasoning. This technique, the \"Self-Taught Reasoner\" (STaR),\nrelies on a simple loop: generate rationales to answer many questions, prompted\nwith a few rationale examples; if the generated answers are wrong, try again to\ngenerate a rationale given the correct answer; fine-tune on all the rationales\nthat ultimately yielded correct answers; repeat. We show that STaR\nsignificantly improves performance on multiple datasets compared to a model\nfine-tuned to directly predict final answers, and performs comparably to\nfine-tuning a 30$\\times$ larger state-of-the-art language model on\nCommensenseQA.

However, in some\nmulti-agent scenarios, the number of agents and the size of action set actually\nvary over time.

In this paper, we propose a new method\ncalled Unshaped Networks for Multi-Agent Systems (UNMAS) that adapts to the\nnumber and size changes in multi-agent systems. We propose the self-weighting\nmixing network to factorize the joint action-value. Its adaption to the change\nin agent number is attributed to the nonlinear mapping from each-agent Q value\nto the joint action-value with individual weights. Besides, in order to address\nthe change in action set, each agent constructs an individual action-value\nnetwork that is composed of two streams to evaluate the constant\nenvironment-oriented subset and the varying unit-oriented subset.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has shown impressive performance in semantic segmentation, but\nit is still unaffordable for resource-constrained mobile devices. While\noffloading computation tasks is promising, the high traffic demands overwhelm\nthe limited bandwidth. Existing compression algorithms are not fit for semantic\nsegmentation, as the lack of obvious and concentrated regions of interest\n(RoIs) forces the adoption of uniform compression strategies, leading to low\ncompression ratios or accuracy. This paper introduces STAC, a DNN-driven\ncompression scheme tailored for edge-assisted semantic video segmentation. STAC\nis the first to exploit DNN's gradients as spatial sensitivity metrics for\nspatial adaptive compression and achieves superior compression ratio and\naccuracy. Yet, it is challenging to adapt this content-customized compression\nto videos. Practical issues include varying spatial sensitivity and huge\nbandwidth consumption for compression strategy feedback and offloading. We\ntackle these issues through a spatiotemporal adaptive scheme, which (1) takes\npartial strategy generation operations offline to reduce communication load,\nand (2) propagates compression strategies and segmentation results across\nframes through dense optical flow, and adaptively offloads keyframes to\naccommodate video content. We implement STAC on a commodity mobile device.\nExperiments show that STAC can save up to 20.95% of bandwidth without losing\naccuracy, compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Equivariance has been a long-standing concern in various fields ranging from\ncomputer vision to physical modeling. Most previous methods struggle with\ngenerality, simplicity, and expressiveness -- some are designed ad hoc for\nspecific data types, some are too complex to be accessible, and some sacrifice\nflexible transformations. In this work, we propose a novel and simple framework\nto achieve equivariance for point cloud analysis based on the message passing\n(graph neural network) scheme. We find the equivariant property could be\nobtained by introducing an orientation for each point to decouple the relative\nposition for each point from the global pose of the entire point cloud.\nTherefore, we extend current message passing networks with a module that learns\norientations for each point. Before aggregating information from the neighbors\nof a point, the networks transforms the neighbors' coordinates based on the\npoint's learned orientations. We provide formal proofs to show the equivariance\nof the proposed framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed method\nis competitive on both point cloud analysis and physical modeling tasks.

    "abstract": "Mathematical reasoning recently has been shown as a hard challenge for neural\nsystems. Abilities including expression translation, logical reasoning, and\nmathematics knowledge acquiring appear to be essential to overcome the\nchallenge. This paper demonstrates that some abilities can be achieved through\nabductive combination with discrete systems that have been programmed with\nhuman knowledge. On a mathematical reasoning dataset, we adopt the recently\nproposed abductive learning framework, and propose the ABL-Sym algorithm that\ncombines the Transformer neural models with a symbolic mathematics library.\nABL-Sym shows 9.73% accuracy improvement on the interpolation tasks and 47.22%\naccuracy improvement on the extrapolation tasks, over the state-of-the-art\napproaches.

    "abstract": "This paper is about the old Wahba problem in its more general form, which we\ncall \"simultaneous search of rotation and correspondences\". In this\ngeneralization we need to find a rotation that best aligns two partially\noverlapping $3$D point sets, of sizes $m$ and $n$ respectively with $m\\geq n$.\nWe first propose a solver, $\\texttt{ARCS}$, that i) assumes noiseless point\nsets in general position, ii) requires only $2$ inliers, iii) uses $O(m\\log m)$\ntime and $O(m)$ space, and iv) can successfully solve the problem even with,\ne.g., $m,n\\sim 10^6$ in about $0.1$ seconds. We next robustify $\\texttt{ARCS}$\nto noise, for which we approximately solve consensus maximization problems\nusing ideas from robust subspace learning and interval stabbing. Thirdly, we\nrefine the approximately found consensus set by a Riemannian subgradient\ndescent approach over the space of unit quaternions, which we show converges\nglobally to an $\\varepsilon$-stationary point in $O(\\varepsilon^{-4})$\niterations, or locally to the ground-truth at a linear rate in the absence of\nnoise. We combine these algorithms into $\\texttt{ARCS+}$, to simultaneously\nsearch for rotations and correspondences. Experiments show that\n$\\texttt{ARCS+}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale datasets\nwith more than $10^6$ points with a $10^4$ time-speedup over alternative\nmethods. \\url{https://github.com/liangzu/ARCS}",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in vision Transformers (ViTs) have come with a voracious\nappetite for computing power, high-lighting the urgent need to develop\nefficient training methods for ViTs. Progressive learning, a training scheme\nwhere the model capacity grows progressively during training, has started\nshowing its ability in efficient training. In this paper, we take a practical\nstep towards efficient training of ViTs by customizing and automating\nprogressive learning. First, we develop a strong manual baseline for\nprogressive learning of ViTs, by introducing momentum growth (MoGrow) to bridge\nthe gap brought by model growth. Then, we propose automated progressive\nlearning (AutoProg), an efficient training scheme that aims to achieve lossless\nacceleration by automatically increasing the training overload on-the-fly; this\nis achieved by adaptively deciding whether, where and how much should the model\ngrow during progressive learning. Specifically, we first relax the optimization\nof the growth schedule to sub-network architecture optimization problem, then\npropose one-shot estimation of the sub-network performance via an elastic\nsupernet. The searching overhead is reduced to minimal by recycling the\nparameters of the supernet. Extensive experiments of efficient training on\nImageNet with two representative ViT models, DeiT and VOLO, demonstrate that\nAutoProg can accelerate ViTs training by up to 85.1% with no performance drop.\nCode: https://github.com/changlin31/AutoProg",

With the\nfocus on the correctness of RDTs (and rightly so), existing approaches to RDTs\nare less efficient compared to their sequential counterparts in terms of time\nand space complexity of local operations. This is unfortunate since RDTs are\noften used in a local-first setting where the local operations far outweigh\nremote communication.\nIn this paper, we present Peepul, a pragmatic approach to building and\nverifying efficient RDTs.

    "abstract": "In nodal based finite element method (FEM), degrees of freedom are associated\nwith the nodes of the element whereas, for edge FEM, degrees of freedom are\nassigned to the edges of the element. Edge element is constructed based on\nWhitney spaces. Nodal elements impose both tangential and normal continuity of\nvector or scalar fields across interface boundaries. But in edge elements only\ntangential continuity is imposed across interface boundaries, which is\nconsistent with electromagnetic field problems. Therefore, the required\ncontinuities in the electromagnetic analysis are directly obtained with edge\nelements, whereas in nodal elements they are attained through potential\nformulations. Hence, while using edge elements, field variables are directly\ncalculated, but with nodal elements, post-processing is required to obtain the\nfield variables from the potentials. Here, we present the finite element\nformulations with the edge element as well as with nodal elements. Thereafter,\nwe have demonstrated the relative performances of different nodal and edge\nelements through a series of examples. All possible complexities like curved\nboundaries, non-convex domains, sharp corners, non-homogeneous domains have\nbeen addressed in those examples. The robustness of edge elements in predicting\nthe singular eigen values for the domains with sharp edges and corners is\nevident in the analysis. A better coarse mesh accuracy has been observed for\nall the edge elements as compared to the respective nodal elements. Edge\nelements are also not susceptible to mesh distortion.",

    "abstract": "3D medical image segmentation methods have been successful, but their\ndependence on large amounts of voxel-level annotated data is a disadvantage\nthat needs to be addressed given the high cost to obtain such annotation.\nSemi-supervised learning (SSL) solve this issue by training models with a large\nunlabelled and a small labelled dataset. The most successful SSL approaches are\nbased on consistency learning that minimises the distance between model\nresponses obtained from perturbed views of the unlabelled data. These\nperturbations usually keep the spatial input context between views fairly\nconsistent, which may cause the model to learn segmentation patterns from the\nspatial input contexts instead of the segmented objects. In this paper, we\nintroduce the Translation Consistent Co-training (TraCoCo) which is a\nconsistency learning SSL method that perturbs the input data views by varying\ntheir spatial input context, allowing the model to learn segmentation patterns\nfrom visual objects. Furthermore, we propose the replacement of the commonly\nused mean squared error (MSE) semi-supervised loss by a new Cross-model\nconfident Binary Cross entropy (CBC) loss, which improves training convergence\nand keeps the robustness to co-training pseudo-labelling mistakes. We also\nextend CutMix augmentation to 3D SSL to further improve generalisation. Our\nTraCoCo shows state-of-the-art results for the Left Atrium (LA) and Brain Tumor\nSegmentation (BRaTS19) datasets with different backbones.

The considered distributed sum-preserving optimization solution\nfurther enables adding purposeful nonlinear constraints, for example,\nsign-based nonlinearities, to reach convergence in predefined-time or robust to\nimpulsive noise and disturbances in faulty environments. Moreover, convergence\ncan be achieved under minimal network connectivity requirements among the\nagents; thus, the solution is applicable over dynamic networks where the\nchannels come and go due to the agent's mobility and limited range.

    "abstract": "As RGB-D sensors become more affordable, using RGB-D images to obtain\nhigh-accuracy 6D pose estimation results becomes a better option.\nState-of-the-art approaches typically use different backbones to extract\nfeatures for RGB and depth images. They use a 2D CNN for RGB images and a\nper-pixel point cloud network for depth data, as well as a fusion network for\nfeature fusion. We find that the essential reason for using two independent\nbackbones is the \"projection breakdown\" problem. In the depth image plane, the\nprojected 3D structure of the physical world is preserved by the 1D depth value\nand its built-in 2D pixel coordinate (UV). Any spatial transformation that\nmodifies UV, such as resize, flip, crop, or pooling operations in the CNN\npipeline, breaks the binding between the pixel value and UV coordinate. As a\nconsequence, the 3D structure is no longer preserved by a modified depth image\nor feature. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method\ndenoted as Uni6D that explicitly takes the extra UV data along with RGB-D\nimages as input. Our method has a Unified CNN framework for 6D pose estimation\nwith a single CNN backbone. In particular, the architecture of our method is\nbased on Mask R-CNN with two extra heads, one named RT head for directly\npredicting 6D pose and the other named abc head for guiding the network to map\nthe visible points to their coordinates in the 3D model as an auxiliary module.\nThis end-to-end approach balances simplicity and accuracy, achieving comparable\naccuracy with state of the arts and 7.2x faster inference speed on the\nYCB-Video dataset.",

The\nobjective of this paper is to minimize the total transmit power at the Radcom\nBS by jointly optimizing the active beamformers, including communication\nbeamformers and radar beamformers, at the Radcom BS and the phase shifts at the\nIRS, subject to the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)\nrequired by communication users, the minimum SINR required by the radar, and\nthe cross-correlation pattern design. In particular, we consider two cases,\nnamely, case I and case II, based on the presence or absence of the radar\ncross-correlation design and the interference introduced by the IRS on the\nRadcom BS. For case I where the cross correlation design and the interference\nare not considered, we prove that the dedicated radar signals are not needed,\nwhich significantly reduces implementation complexity and simplifies algorithm\ndesign. Then, a penalty-based algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting\nnon-convex optimization problem.

To address this concern,\nmethods are proposed to make data unlearnable for deep learning models by\nadding a type of error-minimizing noise. However, such conferred unlearnability\nis found fragile to adversarial training. In this paper, we design new methods\nto generate robust unlearnable examples that are protected from adversarial\ntraining. We first find that the vanilla error-minimizing noise, which\nsuppresses the informative knowledge of data via minimizing the corresponding\ntraining loss, could not effectively minimize the adversarial training loss.\nThis explains the vulnerability of error-minimizing noise in adversarial\ntraining. Based on the observation, robust error-minimizing noise is then\nintroduced to reduce the adversarial training loss. Experiments show that the\nunlearnability brought by robust error-minimizing noise can effectively protect\ndata from adversarial training in various scenarios.

In this article we propose a\nnew lossless compression scheme for real-valued matrices which achieves\nefficient performance in terms of compression ratio and time for linear-algebra\noperations. Experiments show that, as a compressor, our tool is clearly\nsuperior to gzip and it is usually within 20% of xz in terms of compression\nratio. In addition, our compressed format supports matrix-vector\nmultiplications in time and space proportional to the size of the compressed\nrepresentation, unlike gzip and xz that require the full decompression of the\ncompressed matrix.

In\nthis paper, we propose a 3D vehicle localization network CenterLoc3D for\nroadside monocular cameras, which directly predicts centroid and eight vertexes\nin image space, and dimension of 3D bounding boxes without 2D detectors. In\norder to improve the precision of 3D vehicle localization, we propose a\nweighted-fusion module and a loss with spatial constraints embedding in\nCenterLoc3D. Firstly, the transformation matrix between 2D image space and 3D\nworld space is solved by camera calibration. Secondly, vehicle type, centroid,\neight vertexes and dimension of 3D vehicle bounding boxes are obtained by\nCenterLoc3D. Finally, centroid in 3D world space can be obtained by camera\ncalibration and CenterLoc3D for 3D vehicle localization. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first application of 3D vehicle localization for\nroadside monocular cameras.

    "title": "Pyramid Feature Alignment Network for Video Deblurring",
    "abstract": "Video deblurring remains a challenging task due to various causes of\nblurring. Traditional methods have considered how to utilize neighboring frames\nby the single-scale alignment for restoration. However, they typically suffer\nfrom misalignment caused by severe blur. In this work, we aim to better utilize\nneighboring frames with high efficient feature alignment. We propose a Pyramid\nFeature Alignment Network (PFAN) for video deblurring. First, the multi-scale\nfeature of blurry frames is extracted with the strategy of Structure-to-Detail\nDownsampling (SDD) before alignment. This downsampling strategy makes the edges\nsharper, which is helpful for alignment. Then we align the feature at each\nscale and reconstruct the image at the corresponding scale. This strategy\neffectively supervises the alignment at each scale, overcoming the problem of\npropagated errors from the above scales at the alignment stage. To better\nhandle the challenges of complex and large motions, instead of aligning\nfeatures at each scale separately, lower-scale motion information is used to\nguide the higher-scale motion estimation. Accordingly, a Cascade Guided\nDeformable Alignment (CGDA) is proposed to integrate coarse motion into\ndeformable convolution for finer and more accurate alignment. As demonstrated\nin extensive experiments, our proposed PFAN achieves superior performance with\ncompetitive speed compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Visual (image, video) quality assessments can be modelled by visual features\nin different domains, e.g., spatial, frequency, and temporal domains.\nPerceptual mechanisms in the human visual system (HVS) play a crucial role in\nthe generation of quality perception. This paper proposes a general framework\nfor no-reference visual quality assessment using efficient windowed transformer\narchitectures. A lightweight module for multi-stage channel attention is\nintegrated into the Swin (shifted window) Transformer. Such module can\nrepresent the appropriate perceptual mechanisms in image quality assessment\n(IQA) to build an accurate IQA model. Meanwhile, representative features for\nimage quality perception in the spatial and frequency domains can also be\nderived from the IQA model, which are then fed into another windowed\ntransformer architecture for video quality assessment (VQA). The VQA model\nefficiently reuses attention information across local windows to tackle the\nissue of expensive time and memory complexities of original transformer.\nExperimental results on both large-scale IQA and VQA databases demonstrate that\nthe proposed quality assessment models outperform other state-of-the-art models\nby large margins.

However, we argue that occluded regions have strong\ncorrelations with hands so that they can provide highly beneficial information\nfor complete 3D hand mesh estimation. Thus, in this work, we propose a novel 3D\nhand mesh estimation network HandOccNet, that can fully exploits the\ninformation at occluded regions as a secondary means to enhance image features\nand make it much richer. To this end, we design two successive\nTransformer-based modules, called feature injecting transformer (FIT) and self-\nenhancing transformer (SET). FIT injects hand information into occluded region\nby considering their correlation. SET refines the output of FIT by using a\nself-attention mechanism. By injecting the hand information to the occluded\nregion, our HandOccNet reaches the state-of-the-art performance on 3D hand mesh\nbenchmarks that contain challenging hand-object occlusions.

    "abstract": "Domain adaptation (DA) or domain generalization (DG) for face presentation\nattack detection (PAD) has attracted attention recently with its robustness\nagainst unseen attack scenarios. Existing DA/DG-based PAD methods, however,\nhave not yet fully explored the domain-specific style information that can\nprovide knowledge regarding attack styles (e.g., materials, background,\nillumination and resolution). In this paper, we introduce a novel Style-Guided\nDomain Adaptation (SGDA) framework for inference-time adaptive PAD.\nSpecifically, Style-Selective Normalization (SSN) is proposed to explore the\ndomain-specific style information within the high-order feature statistics. The\nproposed SSN enables the adaptation of the model to the target domain by\nreducing the style difference between the target and the source domains.\nMoreover, we carefully design Style-Aware Meta-Learning (SAML) to boost the\nadaptation ability, which simulates the inference-time adaptation with style\nselection process on virtual test domain. In contrast to previous domain\nadaptation approaches, our method does not require either additional auxiliary\nmodels (e.g., domain adaptors) or the unlabeled target domain during training,\nwhich makes our method more practical to PAD task. To verify our experiments,\nwe utilize the public datasets: MSU-MFSD, CASIA-FASD, OULU-NPU and Idiap\nREPLAYATTACK.

This potential mainly stems from the\ncapacity of task offloading and allocation at the network edge, which reduces\nthe delay and improves the quality of service. Despite the significant\npotential, optimizing the performance of a fog network is often challenging. In\nthe fog architecture, the computing nodes are heterogeneous smart devices with\ndistinct abilities and capacities, thereby, preferences. Besides, in an\nultra-dense fog network with random task arrival, centralized control results\nin excessive overhead, and therefore, it is not feasible. We study a\ndistributed task allocation problem in a heterogeneous fog computing network\nunder uncertainty. We formulate the problem as a social-concave game, where the\nplayers attempt to minimize their regret on the path to Nash equilibrium. To\nsolve the formulated problem, we develop two no-regret decision-making\nstrategies.

The other strategy,\nLipschitz Bandit with Initialization, is an EXP3 multi-armed bandit algorithm.\nWe establish a regret bound for both strategies and analyze their convergence\ncharacteristics.

    "abstract": "In Neural Architecture Search (NAS), reducing the cost of architecture\nevaluation remains one of the most crucial challenges. Among a plethora of\nefforts to bypass training of each candidate architecture to convergence for\nevaluation, the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) is emerging as a promising\ntheoretical framework that can be utilized to estimate the performance of a\nneural architecture at initialization. In this work, we revisit several\nat-initialization metrics that can be derived from the NTK and reveal their key\nshortcomings. Then, through the empirical analysis of the time evolution of\nNTK, we deduce that modern neural architectures exhibit highly non-linear\ncharacteristics, making the NTK-based metrics incapable of reliably estimating\nthe performance of an architecture without some amount of training. To take\nsuch non-linear characteristics into account, we introduce Label-Gradient\nAlignment (LGA), a novel NTK-based metric whose inherent formulation allows it\nto capture the large amount of non-linear advantage present in modern neural\narchitectures. With minimal amount of training, LGA obtains a meaningful level\nof rank correlation with the post-training test accuracy of an architecture.\nLastly, we demonstrate that LGA, complemented with few epochs of training,\nsuccessfully guides existing search algorithms to achieve competitive search\nperformances with significantly less search cost.

The framework\nexploits the MOCA-MAN interface to obtain intuitive and simplified human\ndemonstrations and Gaussian Mixture Model/Gaussian Mixture Regression to encode\nand generate the learned task requirements in terms of position, velocity, and\nforce profiles. Next, using the desired trajectories and force profiles\ngenerated by GMM/GMR, the impedance parameters of a Cartesian impedance\ncontroller are optimized online through a Quadratic Program augmented with an\nenergy tank to ensure the passivity of the controlled system. Two experiments\nare conducted to validate the framework, comparing our method with two\napproaches with constant stiffness (high and low). The results showed that the\nproposed method outperforms the other two cases in terms of trajectory tracking\nand generated interaction forces, even in the presence of disturbances such as\nunexpected end-effector collisions.",

    "abstract": "We propose and investigate a probabilistic model of sublinear-time\none-dimensional cellular automata. In particular, we modify the model of ACA\n(which are cellular automata that accept if and only if all cells\nsimultaneously accept) so that every cell changes its state not only dependent\non the states it sees in its neighborhood but also on an unbiased coin toss of\nits own. The resulting model is dubbed \\emph{probabilistic ACA} (PACA),\naccordingly. We consider both one- and two-sided error versions of the model\n(in the same spirit as the classical Turing machine classes $\\mathsf{RP}$ and\n$\\mathsf{BPP}$) and establish a separation between the classes of languages\nthey can recognize all the way up to $o(\\sqrt{n})$ time. We also prove that the\nderandomization of $T(n)$-time PACA (to polynomial-time deterministic cellular\nautomata) for various regimes of $T(n) = \\omega(\\log n)$ implies non-trivial\nderandomization results for the class $\\mathsf{RP}$ (e.g., $\\mathsf{P} =\n\\mathsf{RP}$). Last but not least, as our main contribution we give a full\ncharacterization of the constant-time PACA classes: For one-sided error, the\nclass is equal to that of the deterministic model; that is, we prove that\nconstant-time one-sided error PACA can be fully derandomized with only a\nconstant multiplicative overhead in time complexity. As for two-sided error, we\ncharacterize the respective class in terms of a linear threshold condition and\nprove that it lies in-between the class of strictly locally testable languages\n($\\mathsf{SLT}$) and that of locally threshold testable languages\n($\\mathsf{LTT}$) while being incomparable to the locally testable languages\n($\\mathsf{LT}$).",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose and analyze a set of fully non-stationary Anderson\nacceleration algorithms with dynamic window sizes and optimized damping.\nAlthough Anderson acceleration (AA) has been used for decades to speed up\nnonlinear solvers in many applications, most authors are simply using and\nanalyzing the stationary version of Anderson acceleration (sAA) with fixed\nwindow size and a constant damping factor. The behavior and potential of the\nnon-stationary version of Anderson acceleration methods remain an open\nquestion. Since most efficient linear solvers use composable algorithmic\ncomponents. Similar ideas can be used for AA to solve nonlinear systems. Thus\nin the present work, to develop non-stationary Anderson acceleration\nalgorithms, we first propose two systematic ways to dynamically alternate the\nwindow size $m$ by composition. One simple way to package sAA(m) with sAA(n) in\neach iteration is applying sAA(m) and sAA(n) separately and then average their\nresults. It is an additive composite combination. The other more important way\nis the multiplicative composite combination, which means we apply sAA(m) in the\nouter loop and apply sAA(n) in the inner loop. By doing this, significant gains\ncan be achieved. Secondly, to make AA to be a fully non-stationary algorithm,\nwe need to combine these strategies with our recent work on the non-stationary\nAnderson acceleration algorithm with optimized damping (AAoptD), which is\nanother important direction of producing non-stationary AA and nice performance\ngains have been observed. Moreover, we also investigate the rate of convergence\nof these non-stationary AA methods under suitable assumptions. Finally, our\nnumerical results show that some of these proposed non-stationary Anderson\nacceleration algorithms converge faster than the stationary sAA method and they\nmay significantly reduce the storage and time to find the solution in many\ncases.",

Recent research in cross-lingual representation learning has focused on\noffline mapping approaches due to their simplicity, computational efficacy, and\nability to work with minimal parallel resources. However, they crucially depend\non the assumption of embedding spaces being approximately isomorphic i.e.\nsharing similar geometric structure, which does not hold in practice, leading\nto poorer performance on low-resource and distant language pairs. In this\npaper, we introduce a framework to learn CLWEs, without assuming isometry, for\nlow-resource pairs via joint exploitation of a related higher-resource\nlanguage. In our work, we first pre-align the low-resource and related language\nembedding spaces using offline methods to mitigate the assumption of isometry.\nFollowing this, we use joint training methods to develops CLWEs for the related\nlanguage and the target embed-ding space. Finally, we remap the pre-aligned\nlow-resource space and the target space to generate the final CLWEs. We show\nconsistent gains over current methods in both quality and degree of\nisomorphism, as measured by bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) and eigenvalue\nsimilarity respectively, across several language pairs: {Nepali, Finnish,\nRomanian, Gujarati, Hungarian}-English.

One way to alleviate this problem is the\nuse of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). Nevertheless, due to the\nlarge number of passive reflecting elements on RIS, channel estimation turns\nout to be a challenging task. In this paper, we address the channel estimation\nfor RIS-aided mmWave communication systems based on a localization method. The\nproposed idea consists of exploiting the sparsity of the mmWave channel and the\ntopology of the RIS. In particular, we first propose the concept of reflecting\nunit set (RUS) to improve the flexibility of RIS. We then propose a novel\ncoplanar maximum likelihood-based (CML) 3D positioning method based on the RUS,\nand derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the positioning method.\nFurthermore, we develop an efficient positioning-based channel estimation\nscheme with low computational complexity. Compared to state-of-the-art methods,\nour proposed method requires less time-frequency resources in channel\nacquisition as the complexity is independent to the total size of the RIS but\ndepends on the size of the RUSs, which is only a small portion of the RIS.\nLarge performance gains are confirmed in simulations, which proves the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.",

Recent work \\citep{nakkiran2020distributional} has\nempirically observed that such networks behave as \"conditional samplers\" from\nthe noisy distribution. That is, they replicate the noise in the train data to\nunseen examples. We give a theoretical framework for studying this conditional\nsampling behavior in the context of learning theory. We relate the notion of\nsuch samplers to knowledge distillation, where a student network imitates the\noutputs of a teacher on unlabeled data. We show that samplers, while being bad\nclassifiers, can be good teachers. Concretely, we prove that distillation from\nsamplers is guaranteed to produce a student which approximates the Bayes\noptimal classifier.

Since the\nsurroundings of 3D objects are of high complexity, the separating of different\nobjects is very difficult. To address this challenging problem, we propose a\nnovel framework to group and refine the 3D instances. In practice, we first\nlearn an offset vector for each point and shift it to its predicted instance\ncenter. To better group these points, we propose a Hierarchical Point Grouping\nalgorithm to merge the centrally aggregated points progressively. All points\nare grouped into small clusters, which further gradually undergo another\nclustering procedure to merge into larger groups. These multi-scale groups are\nexploited for instance prediction, which is beneficial for predicting instances\nwith different scales. In addition, a novel MaskScoreNet is developed to\nproduce binary point masks of these groups for further refining the\nsegmentation results. Extensive experiments conducted on the ScanNetV2 and\nS3DIS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For\ninstance, our approach achieves a 66.4\\% mAP with the 0.5 IoU threshold on the\nScanNetV2 test set, which is 1.9\\% higher than the state-of-the-art method.",

    "abstract": "Due to their outstanding properties in challenging conditions, event cameras\nhave become indispensable in a wide range of applications, ranging from\nautomotive, computational photography, and SLAM. However, as further\nimprovements are made to the sensor design, modern event cameras are trending\ntoward higher and higher sensor resolutions, which result in higher bandwidth\nand computational requirements on downstream tasks. Despite this trend, the\nbenefits of using high-resolution event cameras to solve standard computer\nvision tasks are still not clear. In this work, we report the surprising\ndiscovery that, in low-illumination conditions and at high speeds,\nlow-resolution cameras can outperform high-resolution ones, while requiring a\nsignificantly lower bandwidth. We provide both empirical and theoretical\nevidence for this claim, which indicates that high-resolution event cameras\nexhibit higher per-pixel event rates, leading to higher temporal noise in\nlow-illumination conditions and at high speeds. As a result, in most cases,\nhigh-resolution event cameras show a lower task performance, compared to lower\nresolution sensors in these conditions. We empirically validate our findings\nacross several tasks, namely image reconstruction, optical flow estimation, and\ncamera pose tracking, both on synthetic and real data. We believe that these\nfindings will provide important guidelines for future trends in event camera\ndevelopment.",

Machine learning (ML) models,\ncombined with freely-available satellite imagery, can be used to produce\ncost-effective and high spatial-resolution crop maps. However, accessing ground\ntruth data for supervised learning is especially challenging in developing\ncountries due to factors such as smallholding and fragmented geography, which\noften results in a lack of crop type maps or even reliable cropland maps. Our\narea of interest for this study lies in Himachal Pradesh, India, where we aim\nat producing an open-access binary cropland map at 10-meter resolution for the\nKullu, Shimla, and Mandi districts. To this end, we developed an ML pipeline\nthat relies on Sentinel-2 satellite images time series.

We\ntrained and validated the models via spatial cross-validation to account for\nlocal spatial autocorrelation and selected the RF model due to overall\nrobustness and lower computational cost.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) aims at learning discriminative\nrepresentations for person retrieval from unlabeled data. Recent techniques\naccomplish this task by using pseudo-labels, but these labels are inherently\nnoisy and deteriorate the accuracy. To overcome this problem, several\npseudo-label refinement methods have been proposed, but they neglect the\nfine-grained local context essential for person re-ID. In this paper, we\npropose a novel Part-based Pseudo Label Refinement (PPLR) framework that\nreduces the label noise by employing the complementary relationship between\nglobal and part features. Specifically, we design a cross agreement score as\nthe similarity of k-nearest neighbors between feature spaces to exploit the\nreliable complementary relationship. Based on the cross agreement, we refine\npseudo-labels of global features by ensembling the predictions of part\nfeatures, which collectively alleviate the noise in global feature clustering.\nWe further refine pseudo-labels of part features by applying label smoothing\naccording to the suitability of given labels for each part. Thanks to the\nreliable complementary information provided by the cross agreement score, our\nPPLR effectively reduces the influence of noisy labels and learns\ndiscriminative representations with rich local contexts.

Payments via the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, use\npseudonymous addresses that have limited privacy and anonymity guarantees.\nResearch has shown that this pseudonymity can be broken, allowing users to be\ntracked using clustering and tagging heuristics. Such tracking allows crimes to\nbe investigated. If a user has coins stolen, investigators can track addresses\nto identify the destination of the coins. This, combined with an explosion in\nthe popularity of blockchain, has led to a vast increase in new coins and\nservices. These offer new features ranging from coins focused on increased\nanonymity to scams shrouded as smart contracts. In this study, we investigated\nthe extent to which transaction privacy has improved and whether users can\nstill be tracked in these new ecosystems. We began by analysing the\nprivacy-focused coin Zcash, a Bitcoin-forked cryptocurrency, that is considered\nto have strong anonymity properties due to its background in cryptographic\nresearch. We revealed that the user anonymity set can be considerably reduced\nusing heuristics based on usage patterns. Next, we analysed cross-chain\ntransactions collected from the exchange ShapeShift, revealing that users can\nbe tracked as they move across different ledgers. Finally, we present a\nmeasurement study on the smart-contract pyramid scheme Forsage, a scam that\ncycled $267 million USD (of Ethereum) within its first year, showing that at\nleast 88% of the participants in the scheme suffered a loss. The significance\nof this study is the revelation that users can be tracked in newer\ncryptocurrencies and services by using our new heuristics, which informs those\nconducting investigations and developing these technologies.",

    "abstract": "In this work a general framework is proposed to support the development of\nsoftware systems that are able to adapt their behaviour according to the\noperating environment changes. The proposed approach, named REPTILE, works in a\ncomplete proactive manner and relies on Deep Reinforcement Learning-based\nagents to react to events, referred as novelties, that can affect the expected\nbehaviour of the system. In our framework, two types of novelties are taken\ninto account: those related to the context/environment and those related to the\nphysical architecture itself. The framework, predicting those novelties before\ntheir occurrence, extracts time-changing models of the environment and uses a\nsuitable Markov Decision Process to deal with the real-time setting. Moreover,\nthe architecture of our RL agent evolves based on the possible actions that can\nbe taken.",

In this paper, we question to argue that\nthis setup by definition is not compatible with the inherent abstract and\nsubjective nature of sketches, i.e., the model might transfer well to new\ncategories, but will not understand sketches existing in different test-time\ndistribution as a result. We thus extend ZS-SBIR asking it to transfer to both\ncategories and sketch distributions. Our key contribution is a test-time\ntraining paradigm that can adapt using just one sketch. Since there is no\npaired photo, we make use of a sketch raster-vector reconstruction module as a\nself-supervised auxiliary task. To maintain the fidelity of the trained\ncross-modal joint embedding during test-time update, we design a novel\nmeta-learning based training paradigm to learn a separation between model\nupdates incurred by this auxiliary task from those off the primary objective of\ndiscriminative learning. Extensive experiments show our model to outperform\nstate of-the-arts, thanks to the proposed test-time adaption that not only\ntransfers to new categories but also accommodates to new sketching styles.",

The Breakthrough Starshot Program aims\nat eliminating this limitation by traveling to Alpha Centauri, which is 4.37\nlight-years away. Thus, it is only possible if a vehicle travels at a\nsubstantial fraction of the speed of light. The Breakthrough Starshot Program\ninitiatives to develop a proof-of-concept that is accelerating a sail to\nrelativistic speeds using a laser beam aimed at the sail. At this high speed,\nwhile a stable beam riding is one of the crucial concerns of this concept, the\ndynamic stability analysis of a sail is hardly present in the previous\nliterature. Furthermore, it is important to investigate the dynamic stability\nin the experiment before driving the sail to relativistic speeds. As a proof of\nconcept, we study the dynamic stability of the sail levitated at a certain\nheight by a laser beam. The sail's dynamics are modeled as a rigid body whose\nshape is parameterized by a sweep function. We estimate the region of\nattraction (ROA) for dynamic stability analysis using Lyapunov theory and\nSum-of-square (SOS) programming. The ROA confirms how much a levitated sail can\ntolerate the transverse and angular perturbations.

Conventional TTS converts\nphonemes or characters into discrete symbols and synthesizes a speech waveform\nfrom them, thus losing the visual features that the characters essentially\nhave. Therefore, our method synthesizes speech not from discrete symbols but\nfrom visual text. The proposed vTTS extracts visual features with a\nconvolutional neural network and then generates acoustic features with a\nnon-autoregressive model inspired by FastSpeech2. Experimental results show\nthat 1) vTTS is capable of generating speech with naturalness comparable to or\nbetter than a conventional TTS, 2) it can transfer emphasis and emotion\nattributes in visual text to speech without additional labels and\narchitectures, and 3) it can synthesize more natural and intelligible speech\nfrom unseen and rare characters than conventional TTS.",

This new area goes under the name of Learned Data\nStructures. The motivation for its study is a perceived change of paradigm in\nComputer Architectures that would favour the use of Graphics Processing Units\nand Tensor Processing Units over conventional Central Processing Units. In\nturn, that would favour the use of Neural Networks as building blocks of\nClassic Data Structures. Indeed, Learned Bloom Filters, which are one of the\nmain pillars of Learned Data Structures, make extensive use of Neural Networks\nto improve the performance of classic Filters. However, no use of Neural\nNetworks is reported in the realm of Learned Indexes, which is another main\npillar of that new area. In this contribution, we provide the first, and much\nneeded, comparative experimental analysis regarding the use of Neural Networks\nas building blocks of Learned Indexes. The results reported here highlight the\nneed for the design of very specialized Neural Networks tailored to Learned\nIndexes and it establishes a solid ground for those developments. Our findings,\nmethodologically important, are of interest to both Scientists and Engineers\nworking in Neural Networks Design and Implementation, in view also of the\nimportance of the application areas involved, e.g., Computer Networks and Data\nBases.",

    "title": "A Joint Cross-Attention Model for Audio-Visual Fusion in Dimensional  Emotion Recognition",
    "abstract": "Multimodal emotion recognition has recently gained much attention since it\ncan leverage diverse and complementary relationships over multiple modalities\n(e.g., audio, visual, biosignals, etc.), and can provide some robustness to\nnoisy modalities. Most state-of-the-art methods for audio-visual (A-V) fusion\nrely on recurrent networks or conventional attention mechanisms that do not\neffectively leverage the complementary nature of A-V modalities. In this paper,\nwe focus on dimensional emotion recognition based on the fusion of facial and\nvocal modalities extracted from videos. Specifically, we propose a joint\ncross-attention model that relies on the complementary relationships to extract\nthe salient features across A-V modalities, allowing for accurate prediction of\ncontinuous values of valence and arousal. The proposed fusion model efficiently\nleverages the inter-modal relationships, while reducing the heterogeneity\nbetween the features. In particular, it computes the cross-attention weights\nbased on correlation between the combined feature representation and individual\nmodalities. By deploying the combined A-V feature representation into the\ncross-attention module, the performance of our fusion module improves\nsignificantly over the vanilla cross-attention module. Experimental results on\nvalidation-set videos from the AffWild2 dataset indicate that our proposed A-V\nfusion model provides a cost-effective solution that can outperform\nstate-of-the-art approaches.

This paper presents a new online handwritten database of\n20 healthy subjects. The main goal was to study the influence of several\nphysical exercise stimuli in different handwritten tasks and to evaluate the\nrecovery after strenuous exercise. To this aim, they performed different\nhandwritten tasks before and after physical exercise as well as other\nmeasurements such as metabolic and mechanical fatigue assessment. Experimental\nresults showed that although a fast mechanical recovery happens and can be\nmeasured by lactate concentrations and mechanical fatigue, this is not the case\nwhen cognitive effort is required. Handwriting analysis revealed that\nstatistical differences exist on handwriting performance even after lactate\nconcentration and mechanical assessment recovery. Conclusions: This points out\na necessity of more recovering time in sport and professional activities than\nthose measured in classic ways.",

We first consider the\n$o(n)$-space regime and show that, when the input is a stream of all\n$\\binom{n}{2}$ entries of the metric, for any $\\alpha \\ge 2$, both MST and TSP\ncost can be $\\alpha$-approximated using $\\tilde{O}(n/\\alpha)$ space, and that\n$\\Omega(n/\\alpha^2)$ space is necessary for this task. Moreover, we show that\neven if the streaming algorithm is allowed $p$ passes over a metric stream, it\nstill requires $\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\sqrt{n/\\alpha p^2})$ space.\nWe next consider the semi-streaming regime, where computing even the exact\nMST cost is easy and the main challenge is to estimate TSP cost to within a\nfactor that is strictly better than $2$. We show that, if the input is a stream\nof all edges of the weighted graph that induces the underlying metric, for any\n$\\varepsilon > 0$, any one-pass $(2-\\varepsilon)$-approximation of TSP cost\nrequires $\\Omega(\\varepsilon^2 n^2)$ space; on the other hand, there is an\n$\\tilde{O}(n)$ space two-pass algorithm that approximates the TSP cost to\nwithin a factor of 1.96.\nFinally, we consider the query complexity of estimating metric TSP cost to\nwithin a factor that is strictly better than $2$, when the algorithm is given\naccess to a matrix that specifies pairwise distances between all points. For\nMST estimation in this model, it is known that a\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation is achievable with\n$\\tilde{O}(n/\\varepsilon^{O(1)})$ queries.

We call these potential items Rising Star,\nwhich implies their ability to rise from low-turnover items to best-sellers in\nthe future. Rising stars can be used to help with unfair recommendation in\ne-commerce platform, balance supply and demand to benefit the retailers and\nallocate marketing resources rationally. Although the study of rising star can\nbring great benefits, it also poses challenges to us. The sales trend of rising\nstar fluctuates sharply in the short-term and exhibits more contingency caused\nby some external events (e.g., COVID-19 caused increasing purchase of the face\nmask) than other items, which cannot be solved by existing sales prediction\nmethods. To address above challenges, in this paper, we observe that the\npresence of rising stars is closely correlated with the early diffusion of user\ninterest in social networks, which is validated in the case of Taocode (an\nintermediary that diffuses user interest in Taobao). Thus, we propose a novel\nframework, RiseNet, to incorporate the user interest diffusion process with the\nitem dynamic features to effectively predict rising stars. Specifically, we\nadopt a coupled mechanism to capture the dynamic interplay between items and\nuser interest, and a special designed GNN based framework to quantify user\ninterest.

    "title": "HDR Reconstruction from Bracketed Exposures and Events",
    "abstract": "Reconstruction of high-quality HDR images is at the core of modern\ncomputational photography. Significant progress has been made with multi-frame\nHDR reconstruction methods, producing high-resolution, rich and accurate color\nreconstructions with high-frequency details. However, they are still prone to\nfail in dynamic or largely over-exposed scenes, where frame misalignment often\nresults in visible ghosting artifacts. Recent approaches attempt to alleviate\nthis by utilizing an event-based camera (EBC), which measures only binary\nchanges of illuminations. Despite their desirable high temporal resolution and\ndynamic range characteristics, such approaches have not outperformed\ntraditional multi-frame reconstruction methods, mainly due to the lack of color\ninformation and low-resolution sensors. In this paper, we propose to leverage\nboth bracketed LDR images and simultaneously captured events to obtain the best\nof both worlds: high-quality RGB information from bracketed LDRs and\ncomplementary high frequency and dynamic range information from events. We\npresent a multi-modal end-to-end learning-based HDR imaging system that fuses\nbracketed images and event modalities in the feature domain using attention and\nmulti-scale spatial alignment modules. We propose a novel event-to-image\nfeature distillation module that learns to translate event features into the\nimage-feature space with self-supervision. Our framework exploits the higher\ntemporal resolution of events by sub-sampling the input event streams using a\nsliding window, enriching our combined feature representation. Our proposed\napproach surpasses SoTA multi-frame HDR reconstruction methods using synthetic\nand real events, with a 2dB and 1dB improvement in PSNR-L and PSNR-mu on the\nHdM HDR dataset, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Predictions of hydrologic variables across the entire water cycle have\nsignificant value for water resource management as well as downstream\napplications such as ecosystem and water quality modeling. Recently, purely\ndata-driven deep learning models like long short-term memory (LSTM) showed\nseemingly-insurmountable performance in modeling rainfall-runoff and other\ngeoscientific variables, yet they cannot predict unobserved physical variables\nand remain challenging to interpret. Here we show that differentiable,\nlearnable, process-based models (called {\\delta} models here) can approach the\nperformance level of LSTM for the intensively-observed variable (streamflow)\nwith regionalized parameterization. We use a simple hydrologic model HBV as the\nbackbone and use embedded neural networks, which can only be trained in a\ndifferentiable programming framework, to parameterize, replace, or enhance the\nprocess-based model modules. Without using an ensemble or post-processor,\n{\\delta} models can obtain a median Nash Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.715 for 671\nbasins across the USA for a particular forcing data, compared to 0.72 from a\nstate-of-the-art LSTM model with the same setup. Meanwhile, the resulting\nlearnable process-based models can be evaluated (and later, to be trained) by\nmultiple sources of observations, e.g., groundwater storage,\nevapotranspiration, surface runoff, and baseflow. Both simulated\nevapotranspiration and fraction of discharge from baseflow agreed decently with\nalternative estimates. The general framework can work with models with various\nprocess complexity and opens up the path for learning physics from big data.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning classifiers' capability is largely dependent on the scale of\navailable training data and limited by the model overfitting in data-scarce\nlearning tasks. To address this problem, this work proposes a novel framework\nof Meta Functional Learning (MFL) by meta-learning a generalisable functional\nmodel from data-rich tasks whilst simultaneously regularising knowledge\ntransfer to data-scarce tasks. The MFL computes meta-knowledge on functional\nregularisation generalisable to different learning tasks by which functional\ntraining on limited labelled data promotes more discriminative functions to be\nlearned. Based on this framework, we formulate three variants of MFL: MFL with\nPrototypes (MFL-P) which learns a functional by auxiliary prototypes, Composite\nMFL (ComMFL) that transfers knowledge from both functional space and\nrepresentational space, and MFL with Iterative Updates (MFL-IU) which improves\nknowledge transfer regularisation from MFL by progressively learning the\nfunctional regularisation in knowledge transfer. Moreover, we generalise these\nvariants for knowledge transfer regularisation from binary classifiers to\nmulti-class classifiers. Extensive experiments on two few-shot learning\nscenarios, Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL),\nshow that meta functional learning for knowledge transfer regularisation can\nimprove FSL classifiers.",

Relying on implicit workload characterizations such as the\npolyhedral model, analytical approaches often achieve problem-size-independent\nruntimes, but so far have been limited to idealized cache models.\nWe introduce a hybrid approach, warping cache simulation, that aims to\nachieve applicability to real-world cache models and problem-size-independent\nruntimes.

Objective: We\naim to characterize vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts written in\nSolidity, and unify existing classifications schemes. Method: We extracted 2143\nvulnerabilities from public coding platforms and popular vulnerability\ndatabases and categorized them using a card sorting approach.

This paper\npresents the first rigorous PP analysis of the central discontinuous Galerkin\n(CDG) methods and constructs arbitrarily high-order PP CDG schemes for ideal\nMHD. By the recently developed geometric quasilinearization (GQL) approach, our\nanalysis reveals that the PP property of standard CDG methods is closely\nrelated to a discrete DF condition, whose form was unknown and differs from the\nnon-central DG and finite volume cases in [K. Wu, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 2018].\nThis result lays the foundation for the design of our PP CDG schemes. In 1D\ncase, the discrete DF condition is naturally satisfied, and we prove the\nstandard CDG method is PP under a condition that can be enforced with a PP\nlimiter. However, in the multidimensional cases, the discrete DF condition is\nhighly nontrivial yet critical, and we prove the the standard CDG method, even\nwith the PP limiter, is not PP in general, as it fails to meet the discrete DF\ncondition. We address this issue by carefully analyzing the structure of the\ndiscrete divergence and then constructing new locally DF CDG schemes for\nGodunov's modified MHD equations with an additional source. The key point is to\nfind out the suitable discretization of the source term such that it exactly\noffsets all the terms in the discrete DF condition.

Specifically, we first\npropose a novel width-depth synchronous extension-based basis pursuit (WSEBP)\nalgorithm which solves the ML-CSC problem without the limitation of the number\nof iterations compared to the SOTA algorithms and maximizes the performance by\nan effective initialization in each layer.

From a geometric perspective, we obtain convergence bounds based\non the smallest transition probability and the radius of the data, whereas from\na spectral perspective, our bounds are based on the eigenspectrum of the\ndiffusion kernel. Our spectral results are of particular interest since most of\nthe literature on data diffusion is focused on homogeneous processes. From a\ntopological perspective, we show diffusion condensation generalizes\ncentroid-based hierarchical clustering. We use this perspective to obtain a\nbound based on the number of data points, independent of their location. To\nunderstand the evolution of the data geometry beyond convergence, we use\ntopological data analysis. We show that the condensation process itself defines\nan intrinsic diffusion homology. We use this intrinsic topology as well as an\nambient topology to study how the data changes over diffusion time. We\ndemonstrate both homologies in well-understood toy examples. Our work gives\ntheoretical insights into the convergence of diffusion condensation, and shows\nthat it provides a link between topological and geometric data analysis.",

    "abstract": "A promising direction for recovering the lost information in low-resolution\nheadshot images is utilizing a set of high-resolution exemplars from the same\nidentity. Complementary images in the reference set can improve the generated\nheadshot quality across many different views and poses. However, it is\nchallenging to make the best use of multiple exemplars: the quality and\nalignment of each exemplar cannot be guaranteed. Using low-quality and\nmismatched images as references will impair the output results. To overcome\nthese issues, we propose an efficient Headshot Image Super-Resolution with\nMultiple Exemplars network (HIME) method. Compared with previous methods, our\nnetwork can effectively handle the misalignment between the input and the\nreference without requiring facial priors and learn the aggregated reference\nset representation in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, to reconstruct more\ndetailed facial features, we propose a correlation loss that provides a rich\nrepresentation of the local texture in a controllable spatial range.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only has\nsignificantly fewer computation cost than recent exemplar-guided methods but\nalso achieves better qualitative and quantitative performance.",

The standard version of the game is\nplayed on a regular 8 x 8 chessboard by a single player, with only white\npieces, using the following rules: every move must capture a piece, no piece\nmay capture more than 2 times, and if there is a King on the board, it must be\nthe final piece. The goal is to clear the board, i.e, make a sequence of\ncaptures after which only one piece is left.\nWe generalize this game to unbounded boards with $n$ pieces, each of which\nhave a given number of captures that they are permitted to make. We show that\nGeneralized Solo Chess is NP-complete, even when it is played by only rooks\nthat have at most two captures remaining. It also turns out to be NP-complete\neven when every piece is a queen with exactly two captures remaining in the\ninitial configuration. In contrast, we show that solvable instances of\nGeneralized Solo Chess can be completely characterized when the game is: a)\nplayed by rooks on a one-dimensional board, and b) played by pawns with two\ncaptures left on a 2D board.\nInspired by Generalized Solo Chess, we also introduce the Graph Capture Game,\nwhich involves clearing a graph of tokens via captures along edges. This game\nsubsumes Generalized Solo Chess played by knights. We show that the Graph\nCapture Game is NP-complete for undirected graphs and DAGs.",

Temporal Graph Neural\nNetworks capture temporal information as well as structural and contextual\ninformation in the generated dynamic node embeddings. Researchers have shown\nthat these embeddings achieve state-of-the-art performance in many different\ntasks. In this work, we propose TGL, a unified framework for large-scale\noffline Temporal Graph Neural Network training where users can compose various\nTemporal Graph Neural Networks with simple configuration files. TGL comprises\nfive main components, a temporal sampler, a mailbox, a node memory module, a\nmemory updater, and a message passing engine. We design a Temporal-CSR data\nstructure and a parallel sampler to efficiently sample temporal neighbors to\nformtraining mini-batches. We propose a novel random chunk scheduling technique\nthat mitigates the problem of obsolete node memory when training with a large\nbatch size. To address the limitations of current TGNNs only being evaluated on\nsmall-scale datasets, we introduce two large-scale real-world datasets with 0.2\nand 1.3 billion temporal edges. We evaluate the performance of TGL on four\nsmall-scale datasets with a single GPU and the two large datasets with multiple\nGPUs for both link prediction and node classification tasks. We compare TGL\nwith the open-sourced code of five methods and show that TGL achieves similar\nor better accuracy with an average of 13x speedup.

    "abstract": "Spark SQL has been widely deployed in industry but it is challenging to tune\nits performance. Recent studies try to employ machine learning (ML) to solve\nthis problem, but suffer from two drawbacks. First, it takes a long time (high\noverhead) to collect training samples. Second, the optimal configuration for\none input data size of the same application might not be optimal for others.\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel Bayesian Optimization (BO) based\napproach named LOCAT to automatically tune the configurations of Spark SQL\napplications online. LOCAT innovates three techniques. The first technique,\nnamed QCSA, eliminates the configuration-insensitive queries by Query\nConfiguration Sensitivity Analysis (QCSA) when collecting training samples. The\nsecond technique, dubbed DAGP, is a Datasize-Aware Gaussian Process (DAGP)\nwhich models the performance of an application as a distribution of functions\nof configuration parameters as well as input data size. The third technique,\ncalled IICP, Identifies Important Configuration Parameters (IICP) with respect\nto performance and only tunes the important ones. As such, LOCAT can tune the\nconfigurations of a Spark SQL application with low overhead and adapt to\ndifferent input data sizes.\nWe employ Spark SQL applications from benchmark suites TPC-DS, TPC-H, and\nHiBench running on two significantly different clusters, a four-node ARM\ncluster and an eight-node x86 cluster, to evaluate LOCAT. The experimental\nresults on the ARM cluster show that LOCAT accelerates the optimization\nprocedures of the state-of-the-art approaches by at least 4.1x and up to 9.7x;\nmoreover, LOCAT improves the application performance by at least 1.9x and up to\n2.4x.

In addition, standard map functions are\ninsufficient to distribute their data-changing argument functions over all of\nthe structure present in elements of deep GADTs, even just deep ADTs or nested\ntypes. This paper develops an algorithm for detecting exactly which functions\nare mappable over data whose types are (deep) GADTs. The algorithm takes as\ninput a term t whose type is an instance of a deep GADT D and a function f to\nbe mapped over t. It detects a minimal possible shape of t as an element of D,\nand returns a minimal set of constraints f must satisfy to be mappable over t.\nThe crux of the algorithm is its ability to separate t's essential structure as\nan element of D -- i.e., the part of t that is essential for it to have the\nshape of an element of D -- from its incidental structure as an element of D --\ni.e., the part of t that is simply data in the positions of this shape. The\nalgorithm ensures that the constraints on f come only from t's essential\nstructure.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has made enormous progress and largely\nnarrowed the gap with the supervised ones, where the representation learning is\nmainly guided by a projection into an embedding space. During the projection,\ncurrent methods simply adopt uniform aggregation of pixels for embedding;\nhowever, this risks involving object-irrelevant nuisances and spatial\nmisalignment for different augmentations. In this paper, we present a new\napproach, Learning Where to Learn (LEWEL), to adaptively aggregate spatial\ninformation of features, so that the projected embeddings could be exactly\naligned and thus guide the feature learning better. Concretely, we reinterpret\nthe projection head in SSL as a per-pixel projection and predict a set of\nspatial alignment maps from the original features by this weight-sharing\nprojection head. A spectrum of aligned embeddings is thus obtained by\naggregating the features with spatial weighting according to these alignment\nmaps.

We discuss the implementation details of the\nalgorithm as well as compare it with both the previously available sequential\nversion of the ABCD model and with the parallel implementation of the standard\nand extensively used LFR generator. We show that ABCDe is more than ten times\nfaster and scales better than the parallel implementation of LFR provided in\nNetworKit. Moreover, the algorithm is not only faster but random graphs\ngenerated by ABCD have similar properties to the ones generated by the original\nLFR algorithm, while the parallelized NetworKit implementation of LFR produces\ngraphs that have noticeably different characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Modern object detectors have achieved impressive progress under the close-set\nsetup. However, open-set object detection (OSOD) remains challenging since\nobjects of unknown categories are often misclassified to existing known\nclasses. In this work, we propose to identify unknown objects by separating\nhigh/low-density regions in the latent space, based on the consensus that\nunknown objects are usually distributed in low-density latent regions. As\ntraditional threshold-based methods only maintain limited low-density regions,\nwhich cannot cover all unknown objects, we present a novel Open-set Detector\n(OpenDet) with expanded low-density regions. To this aim, we equip OpenDet with\ntwo learners, Contrastive Feature Learner (CFL) and Unknown Probability Learner\n(UPL). CFL performs instance-level contrastive learning to encourage compact\nfeatures of known classes, leaving more low-density regions for unknown\nclasses; UPL optimizes unknown probability based on the uncertainty of\npredictions, which further divides more low-density regions around the cluster\nof known classes. Thus, unknown objects in low-density regions can be easily\nidentified with the learned unknown probability. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method can significantly improve the OSOD performance,\ne.g., OpenDet reduces the Absolute Open-Set Errors by 25%-35% on six OSOD\nbenchmarks.

Imitation learning approaches such as adversarial motion\npriors aim to reduce this problem by encouraging a pre-defined motion style.

    "abstract": "Taxonomies have been widely used in various domains to underpin numerous\napplications. Specially, product taxonomies serve an essential role in the\ne-commerce domain for the recommendation, browsing, and query understanding.\nHowever, taxonomies need to constantly capture the newly emerged terms or\nconcepts in e-commerce platforms to keep up-to-date, which is expensive and\nlabor-intensive if it relies on manual maintenance and updates. Therefore, we\ntarget the taxonomy expansion task to attach new concepts to existing\ntaxonomies automatically. In this paper, we present a self-supervised and user\nbehavior-oriented product taxonomy expansion framework to append new concepts\ninto existing taxonomies. Our framework extracts hyponymy relations that\nconform to users' intentions and cognition. Specifically, i) to fully exploit\nuser behavioral information, we extract candidate hyponymy relations that match\nuser interests from query-click concepts; ii) to enhance the semantic\ninformation of new concepts and better detect hyponymy relations, we model\nconcepts and relations through both user-generated content and structural\ninformation in existing taxonomies and user click logs, by leveraging\nPre-trained Language Models and Graph Neural Network combined with Contrastive\nLearning; iii) to reduce the cost of dataset construction and overcome data\nskews, we construct a high-quality and balanced training dataset from existing\ntaxonomy with no supervision. Extensive experiments on real-world product\ntaxonomies in Meituan Platform, a leading Chinese vertical e-commerce platform\nto order take-out with more than 70 million daily active users, demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our proposed framework over state-of-the-art methods.

Temporal models in evolving networks are\ncrucial in many applications that need to analyze dynamic spread. For example,\na disease-spreading virus has varying transmissibility based on interactions\nbetween individuals occurring over time with different frequency, proximity,\nand venue population density. To capture such behaviors, we first develop the\nTemporal Independent Cascade (T-IC) model and propose a novel spread function,\nthat we prove to be submodular, with a hypergraph-based sampling strategy that\nefficiently utilizes dynamic propagation probabilities. We then introduce the\nnotion of 'reverse spread' using the proposed T-IC processes, and develop\nsolutions to identify both sentinel/detector nodes and highly susceptible\nnodes. The proven guarantees of approximation quality enable scalable analysis\nof highly granular temporal networks. Extensive experimental results on a\nvariety of real-world datasets show that the proposed approach significantly\noutperforms the alternatives in modeling both if and how spread occurs, by\nconsidering evolving network topology as well as granular contact/interaction\ninformation. Our approach has numerous applications, including its utility for\nthe vital challenge of monitoring disease spread.

In this paper, we introduce a novel method, detection prompt\n(DetPro), to learn continuous prompt representations for open-vocabulary object\ndetection based on the pre-trained vision-language model. Different from the\nprevious classification-oriented methods, DetPro has two highlights: 1) a\nbackground interpretation scheme to include the proposals in image background\ninto the prompt training; 2) a context grading scheme to separate proposals in\nimage foreground for tailored prompt training. We assemble DetPro with ViLD, a\nrecent state-of-the-art open-world object detector, and conduct experiments on\nthe LVIS as well as transfer learning on the Pascal VOC, COCO, Objects365\ndatasets. Experimental results show that our DetPro outperforms the baseline\nViLD in all settings, e.g., +3.4 APbox and +3.0 APmask improvements on the\nnovel classes of LVIS.

In many real-world\napplications, the LiDAR points used by mass-produced robots and vehicles\nusually have fewer beams than that in large-scale public datasets.

In each iteration, we first generate low-beam pseudo LiDAR by\ndownsampling the high-beam point clouds. Then the teacher-student framework is\nemployed to distill rich information from the data with more beams.

Our MIL\nmodels are not only able to predict whether flares occur within the next\n$\\sim$25 minutes with accuracies of around 90%, but are also able to explain\nwhich spectral profiles were particularly important for their bag-level\nprediction. This information can be used to highlight regions of interest in\nongoing IRIS observations in real-time and to identify candidates for typical\nflare precursor spectral profiles. We use k-means clustering to extract groups\nof spectral profiles that appear relevant for flare prediction. The recovered\ngroups show high intensity, triplet red wing emission and single-peaked h and k\nlines, as found by previous works. They seem to be related to small-scale\nexplosive events that have been reported to occur tens of minutes before a\nflare.",

It has two main steps which are linear\nreconstruction and linear embedding of points in the input space and embedding\nspace, respectively. In this work, we look at the linear reconstruction step\nfrom a stochastic perspective where it is assumed that every data point is\nconditioned on its linear reconstruction weights as latent factors. The\nstochastic linear reconstruction of LLE is solved using expectation\nmaximization. We show that there is a theoretical connection between three\nfundamental dimensionality reduction methods, i.e., LLE, factor analysis, and\nprobabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The stochastic linear\nreconstruction of LLE is formulated similar to the factor analysis and\nprobabilistic PCA. It is also explained why factor analysis and probabilistic\nPCA are linear and LLE is a nonlinear method.

    "abstract": "Considerable effort has been made recently in the development of heuristic\nquantum algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Meanwhile,\nthese problems have been studied extensively in classical computing for\ndecades. In this paper, we explore a natural approach to leveraging existing\nclassical techniques to enhance quantum optimization. Specifically, we run a\nclassical algorithm to find an approximate solution and then use a quantum\ncircuit to search its \"neighborhood\" for higher-quality solutions. We propose\nthe Classically-Boosted Quantum Optimization Algorithm (CBQOA) that is based on\nthis idea and can solve a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems,\nincluding all unconstrained problems and many important constrained problems\nsuch as Max Bisection, Maximum Independent Set, Minimum Vertex Cover, Portfolio\nOptimization, Traveling Salesperson and so on. A crucial component of this\nalgorithm is an efficiently-implementable continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW)\non a properly-constructed graph that connects the feasible solutions. CBQOA\nutilizes this CTQW and the output of an efficient classical procedure to create\na suitable superposition of the feasible solutions which is then processed in\ncertain way. This algorithm has the merits that it solves constrained problems\nwithout modifying their cost functions, confines the evolution of the quantum\nstate to the feasible subspace, and does not rely on efficient indexing of the\nfeasible solutions. We demonstrate the applications of CBQOA to Max 3SAT and\nMax Bisection, and provide empirical evidence that it outperforms previous\napproaches on these problems.",

    "abstract": "Recently there has been significant interest in measuring time-varying\nfunctional connectivity (TVC) between different brain regions using\nresting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. One way to\nassess the relationship between signals from different brain regions is to\nmeasure their phase synchronization (PS) across time. However, this requires\nthe \\textit{a priori} choice of type and cut-off frequencies for the bandpass\nfilter needed to perform the analysis. Here we explore alternative approaches\nbased on the use of various mode decomposition (MD) techniques that circumvent\nthis issue. These techniques allow for the data driven decomposition of signals\njointly into narrow-band components at different frequencies, thus fulfilling\nthe requirements needed to measure PS. We explore several variants of MD,\nincluding empirical mode decomposition (EMD), bivariate EMD (BEMD),\nnoise-assisted multivariate EMD (na-MEMD), and introduce the use of\nmultivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) in the context of estimating\ntime-varying PS. We contrast the approaches using a series of simulations and\napplication to rs-fMRI data. Our results show that MVMD outperforms other\nevaluated MD approaches, and further suggests that this approach can be used as\na tool to reliably investigate time-varying PS in rs-fMRI data.",

Compared with SR reconstruction using a single-contrast,\nmulti-contrast SR reconstruction is promising to yield SR images with higher\nquality by leveraging diverse yet complementary information embedded in\ndifferent imaging modalities. However, existing methods still have two\nshortcomings: (1) they neglect that the multi-contrast features at different\nscales contain different anatomical details and hence lack effective mechanisms\nto match and fuse these features for better reconstruction; and (2) they are\nstill deficient in capturing long-range dependencies, which are essential for\nthe regions with complicated anatomical structures. We propose a novel network\nto comprehensively address these problems by developing a set of innovative\nTransformer-empowered multi-scale contextual matching and aggregation\ntechniques; we call it McMRSR. Firstly, we tame transformers to model\nlong-range dependencies in both reference and target images. Then, a new\nmulti-scale contextual matching method is proposed to capture corresponding\ncontexts from reference features at different scales. Furthermore, we introduce\na multi-scale aggregation mechanism to gradually and interactively aggregate\nmulti-scale matched features for reconstructing the target SR MR image.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches and has great potential to be applied in clinical practice.

We expose this connection in\nthe setting of inquisitive logic with tensor disjunction discussed by Ciardelli\nand Barbero (2019}, but from an epistemic perspective. More specifically, we\ntranslate the propositional formulae of inquisitive logic with tensor into\nmodal formulae in a powerful epistemic language of \"knowing how\" following the\nproposal by Wang (2021). We give a complete axiomatization of the logic of our\nfull language based on Fine's axiomatization of S5 modal logic with\npropositional quantifiers. Finally, we generalize the tensor operator with\nparameters $k$ and $n$, which intuitively captures the epistemic situation that\none knows $n$ potential answers to $n$ questions and is sure $k$ answers of\nthem must be correct. The original tensor disjunction is the special case when\n$k=1$ and $n=2$. We show that the generalized tensor operators do not increase\nthe expressive power of our logic, the inquisitive logic, and propositional\ndependence logic, though most of these generalized tensors are not uniformly\ndefinable in these logics, except in our dynamic epistemic logic of knowing\nhow.",

For\nthe goal of strong artificial intelligence that can mimic human-level\nintelligence, AI systems would have the ability to adapt to ever-changing\nscenarios and learn new knowledge continuously without forgetting previously\nacquired knowledge. A phenomenon called catastrophic forgetting emerges when a\nmachine learning model is trained across multiple tasks. The model's\nperformance on previously learned tasks may drop dramatically during the\nlearning process of the newly seen task. Some continual learning strategies\nhave been proposed to address the catastrophic forgetting problem. Recently,\ncontinual learning has also been studied in the context of quantum machine\nlearning. By leveraging the elastic weight consolidation method, a single\nquantum classifier can perform multiple tasks after being trained consecutively\non those tasks. In this work, we incorporate the gradient episodic memory\nmethod to train a variational quantum classifier. The gradient of the current\ntask is projected to the closest gradient, avoiding the increase of the loss at\nprevious tasks, but allowing the decrease. We use six quantum state\nclassification tasks to benchmark this method. Numerical simulation results\nshow that better performance is obtained compared to the elastic weight\nconsolidation method.

    "title": "NUNet: Deep Learning for Non-Uniform Super-Resolution of Turbulent Flows",
    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are becoming increasingly popular for the\nreconstruction of high-resolution turbulent flows (aka super-resolution).\nHowever, current DL approaches perform spatially uniform super-resolution - a\nkey performance limiter for scalability of DL-based surrogates for\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).\nTo address the above challenge, we introduce NUNet, a deep learning-based\nadaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework for non-uniform super-resolution of\nturbulent flows. NUNet divides the input low-resolution flow field into\npatches, scores each patch, and predicts their target resolution. As a result,\nit outputs a spatially non-uniform flow field, adaptively refining regions of\nthe fluid domain to achieve the target accuracy. We train NUNet with\nReynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solutions from three different canonical\nflows, namely turbulent channel flow, flat plate, and flow around ellipses.\nNUNet shows remarkable discerning properties, refining areas with complex flow\nfeatures, such as near-wall domains and the wake region in flow around solid\nbodies, while leaving areas with smooth variations (such as the freestream) in\nthe low-precision range. Hence, NUNet demonstrates an excellent qualitative and\nquantitative alignment with the traditional OpenFOAM AMR solver. Moreover, it\nreaches the same convergence guarantees as the AMR solver while accelerating it\nby 3.2-5.5x, including unseen-during-training geometries and boundary\nconditions, demonstrating its generalization capacities. Due to NUNet's ability\nto super-resolve only regions of interest, it predicts the same target\n1024x1024 spatial resolution 7-28.5x faster than state-of-the-art DL methods\nand reduces the memory usage by 4.4-7.65x, showcasing improved scalability.",

    "abstract": "Privacy and security are major concerns when sharing and collecting speech\ndata for cloud services such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech\nemotion recognition (SER). Existing solutions for client-side privacy mainly\nfocus on voice conversion or voice modification to convert a raw utterance into\nanother one with similar content but different, or no, identity-related\ninformation. However, an alternative approach to share speech data under the\nform of privacy-preserving representations has been largely under-explored. To\nfill this gap, we propose a speech anonymization framework that provides formal\nprivacy guarantees via noise perturbation to a selected subset of the\nhigh-utility representations extracted using a pre-trained speech encoder. The\nsubset is chosen with a Transformer-based privacy-risk saliency estimator. We\nvalidate our framework on four tasks, namely, Automatic Speaker Verification\n(ASV), ASR, SER and Intent Classification (IC) for privacy and utility\nassessment. Experimental results show that our approach is able to achieve a\ncompetitive, or even better, utility compared to the baselines that use voice\nconversion and voice modification, providing the same level of privacy.\nMoreover, the easily-controlled amount of perturbation allows our framework to\nhave a flexible range of privacy-utility trade-offs without re-training any\ncomponents.",

Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer\nglobally, and its early diagnosis is pivotal for the complete elimination of\nmalignant tumors from the body. This research develops an Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) framework for supervised skin lesion segmentation employing\nthe deep learning approach. The proposed framework, called MFSNet (Multi-Focus\nSegmentation Network), uses differently scaled feature maps for computing the\nfinal segmentation mask using raw input RGB images of skin lesions.

In different stages of the network, convolution features and multi-scale\nmaps are used in two boundary attention (BA) modules and two reverse attention\n(RA) modules to generate the final segmentation output. MFSNet, when evaluated\non three publicly available datasets: $PH^2$, ISIC 2017, and HAM10000,\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, justifying the reliability of the\nframework.

    "abstract": "Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are an essential source of space radiation,\nwhich are hazards for humans in space, spacecraft, and technology in general.\nIn this paper we propose a deep learning method, specifically a bidirectional\nlong short-term memory (biLSTM) network, to predict if an active region (AR)\nwould produce an SEP event given that (i) the AR will produce an M- or X-class\nflare and a coronal mass ejection (CME) associated with the flare, or (ii) the\nAR will produce an M- or X-class flare regardless of whether or not the flare\nis associated with a CME. The data samples used in this study are collected\nfrom the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite's X-ray flare\ncatalogs provided by the National Centers for Environmental Information. We\nselect M- and X-class flares with identified ARs in the catalogs for the period\nbetween 2010 and 2021, and find the associations of flares, CMEs and SEPs in\nthe Space Weather Database of Notifications, Knowledge, Information during the\nsame period. Each data sample contains physical parameters collected from the\nHelioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory.\nExperimental results based on different performance metrics demonstrate that\nthe proposed biLSTM network is better than related machine learning algorithms\nfor the two SEP prediction tasks studied here. We also discuss extensions of\nour approach for probabilistic forecasting and calibration with empirical\nevaluation.",

    "abstract": "Challenging combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and\nengineering. Several quantum methods for optimization have recently been\ndeveloped, in different settings including both exact and approximate solvers.\nAddressing this field of research, this manuscript has three distinct purposes.\nFirst, we present an intuitive method for synthesizing and analyzing discrete\n(i.e., integer-based) optimization problems, wherein the problem and\ncorresponding algorithmic primitives are expressed using a discrete quantum\nintermediate representation (DQIR) that is encoding-independent. This compact\nrepresentation often allows for more efficient problem compilation, automated\nanalyses of different encoding choices, easier interpretability, more complex\nruntime procedures, and richer programmability, as compared to previous\napproaches, which we demonstrate with a number of examples. Second, we perform\nnumerical studies comparing several qubit encodings; the results exhibit a\nnumber of preliminary trends that help guide the choice of encoding for a\nparticular set of hardware and a particular problem and algorithm. Our study\nincludes problems related to graph coloring, the traveling salesperson problem,\nfactory/machine scheduling, financial portfolio rebalancing, and integer linear\nprogramming. Third, we design low-depth graph-derived partial mixers (GDPMs) up\nto 16-level quantum variables, demonstrating that compact (binary) encodings\nare more amenable to QAOA than previously understood. We expect this toolkit of\nprogramming abstractions and low-level building blocks to aid in designing\nquantum algorithms for discrete combinatorial problems.",

    "abstract": "The use of patent citation networks as research tools is becoming\nincreasingly commonplace in the field of innovation studies. However, these\nnetworks rarely consider the contexts in which these citations are generated\nand are generally restricted to a single jurisdiction. Here, we propose and\nexplore the use of a multilayer network framework that can naturally\nincorporate citation metadata and stretch across jurisdictions, allowing for a\ncomplete view of the global technological landscape that is accessible through\npatent data. Taking a conservative approach that links citation network layers\nthrough triadic patent families, we first observe that these layers contain\ncomplementary, rather than redundant, information about technological\nrelationships. To probe the nature of this complementarity, we extract network\ncommunities from both the multilayer network and analogous single-layer\nnetworks, then directly compare their technological composition with\nestablished technological similarity networks. We find that while technologies\nare more splintered across communities in the multilayer case, the extracted\ncommunities match much more closely the established networks. We conclude that\nby capturing citation context, a multilayer representation of patent citation\nnetworks is, conceptually and empirically, better able to capture the\nsignificant nuance that exists in real technological relationships when\ncompared to traditional, single-layer approaches. We suggest future avenues of\nresearch that take advantage of novel computational tools designed for use with\nmultilayer networks.",

Obtaining these measurements is highly\nsubjective, expertise-driven, and requires years of training experience,\nlimiting quality prenatal care for all pregnant mothers. In this study, we\npropose a deep learning (DL) approach to compute 3 key fetal brain biometry\nfrom the 2D USG images of the transcerebellar plane (TC) through the accurate\nand automated caliper placement (2 per biometry) by modeling it as a landmark\ndetection problem.

We performed multiple experiments\ndemonstrating the effect of the DL backbone, data augmentation,\ngeneralizability and benchmarked against a recent state-of-the-art approach\nthrough extensive clinical validation (DL vs. 7 experienced clinicians). For\nall cases, the mean errors in the placement of the individual caliper points\nand the computed biometry were comparable to error rates among clinicians.

Although the earlier\ndeveloped methods address the lack of data and specific annotations, the\ncurrent goal is to build a robust algorithm for clinical use, having a larger\npool of available data. With the larger datasets, the domain shift problem\narises, affecting the performance of methods on the unseen data. One of the\ncritical sources of domain shift in CT images is the difference in\nreconstruction kernels used to generate images from the raw data (sinograms).\nIn this paper, we show a decrease in the COVID-19 segmentation quality of the\nmodel trained on the smooth and tested on the sharp reconstruction kernels.\nFurthermore, we compare several domain adaptation approaches to tackle the\nproblem, such as task-specific augmentation and unsupervised adversarial\nlearning. Finally, we propose the unsupervised adaptation method, called\nF-Consistency, that outperforms the previous approaches. Our method exploits a\nset of unlabeled CT image pairs which differ only in reconstruction kernels\nwithin every pair. It enforces the similarity of the network hidden\nrepresentations (feature maps) by minimizing mean squared error (MSE) between\npaired feature maps. We show our method achieving 0.64 Dice Score on the test\ndataset with unseen sharp kernels, compared to the 0.56 Dice Score of the\nbaseline model. Moreover, F-Consistency scores 0.80 Dice Score between\npredictions on the paired images, which almost doubles the baseline score of\n0.46 and surpasses the other methods.

A coexistence transmission of 1.6 Tbps is achieved for the\nclassical channels simultaneously with a quantum channel over a 2 km-long\nHC-NANF with a total coexistence power of 0 dBm.

    "abstract": "The use of deep learning has successfully solved several problems in the\nfield of medical imaging. Deep learning has been applied to the CT denoising\nproblem successfully. However, the use of deep learning requires large amounts\nof data to train deep convolutional networks (CNNs). Moreover, due to large\nparameter count, such deep CNNs may cause unexpected results. In this study, we\nintroduce a novel CT denoising framework, which has interpretable behaviour,\nand provides useful results with limited data. We employ bilateral filtering in\nboth the projection and volume domains to remove noise. To account for\nnon-stationary noise, we tune the $\\sigma$ parameters of the volume for every\nprojection view, and for every volume pixel. The tuning is carried out by two\ndeep CNNs. Due to impracticality of labelling, the two deep CNNs are trained\nvia a Deep-Q reinforcement learning task. The reward for the task is generated\nby using a custom reward function represented by a neural network. Our\nexperiments were carried out on abdominal scans for the Mayo Clinic TCIA\ndataset, and the AAPM Low Dose CT Grand Challenge. Our denoising framework has\nexcellent denoising performance increasing the PSNR from 28.53 to 28.93, and\nincreasing the SSIM from 0.8952 to 0.9204. We outperform several\nstate-of-the-art deep CNNs, which have several orders of magnitude higher\nnumber of parameters (p-value (PSNR) = 0.000, p-value (SSIM) = 0.000). Our\nmethod does not introduce any blurring, which is introduced by MSE loss based\nmethods, or any deep learning artifacts, which are introduced by WGAN based\nmodels. Our ablation studies show that parameter tuning and using our reward\nnetwork results in the best possible results.",

In addition to\nsignal processing approaches, methods for SER now also use deep learning\ntechniques which provide transfer learning possibilities. However, generalizing\nover languages, corpora and recording conditions is still an open challenge. In\nthis work we address this gap by exploring loss functions that aid in\ntransferability, specifically to non-tonal languages. We propose a variational\nautoencoder (VAE) with KL annealing and a semi-supervised VAE to obtain more\nconsistent latent embedding distributions across data sets. To ensure\ntransferability, the distribution of the latent embedding should be similar\nacross non-tonal languages (data sets). We start by presenting a low-complexity\nSER based on a denoising-autoencoder, which achieves an unweighted\nclassification accuracy of over 52.09% for four-class emotion classification.\nThis performance is comparable to that of similar baseline methods. Following\nthis, we employ a VAE, the semi-supervised VAE and the VAE with KL annealing to\nobtain a more regularized latent space. We show that while the DAE has the\nhighest classification accuracy among the methods, the semi-supervised VAE has\na comparable classification accuracy and a more consistent latent embedding\ndistribution over data sets.",

    "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition~(SER) refers to the technique of inferring the\nemotional state of an individual from speech signals. SERs continue to garner\ninterest due to their wide applicability. Although the domain is mainly founded\non signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning, generalizing over\nlanguages continues to remain a challenge. However, developing generalizable\nand transferable models are critical due to a lack of sufficient resources in\nterms of data and labels for languages beyond the most commonly spoken ones. To\nimprove performance over languages, we propose a denoising autoencoder with\nsemi-supervision using a continuous metric loss based on either activation or\nvalence. The novelty of this work lies in our proposal of continuous metric\nlearning, which is among the first proposals on the topic to the best of our\nknowledge. Furthermore, to address the lack of activation and valence labels in\nthe transfer datasets, we annotate the signal samples with activation and\nvalence levels corresponding to a dimensional model of emotions, which were\nthen used to evaluate the quality of the embedding over the transfer datasets.\nWe show that the proposed semi-supervised model consistently outperforms the\nbaseline unsupervised method, which is a conventional denoising autoencoder, in\nterms of emotion classification accuracy as well as correlation with respect to\nthe dimensional variables. Further evaluation of classification accuracy with\nrespect to the reference, a BERT based speech representation model, shows that\nthe proposed method is comparable to the reference method in classifying\nspecific emotion classes at a much lower complexity.",

Using\npre-acquired data, we then train the model end-to-end for a task of interest.\nThe learnt design proposal can then be simplified by interpreting the learnt\noptical elements. As a first demonstration, based on the optical 4-$f$ system,\nwe present an all-optical quantitative phase microscope (QPM) design that\nrequires no computational post-reconstruction. A follow-up literature survey\nsuggested that the learnt architecture is similar to the generalized phase\nconcept developed two decades ago. We then incorporate the generalized phase\ncontrast concept to simplify the learning procedure. Furthermore, this physical\noptical setup is miniaturized using a diffractive deep neural network (D2NN).\nWe outperform the existing benchmark for all-optical phase-to-intensity\nconversion on multiple datasets, and ours is the first demonstration of its\nkind on D2NNs. The proposed differentiable microscopy framework supplements the\ncreative process of designing new optical systems and would perhaps lead to\nunconventional but better optical designs.",

    "abstract": "The trade-off between throughput and image quality is an inherent challenge\nin microscopy. To improve throughput, compressive imaging under-samples image\nsignals; the images are then computationally reconstructed by solving a\nregularized inverse problem. Compared to traditional regularizers, Deep\nLearning based methods have achieved greater success in compression and image\nquality. However, the information loss in the acquisition process sets the\ncompression bounds. Further improvement in compression, without compromising\nthe reconstruction quality is thus a challenge. In this work, we propose\ndifferentiable compressive fluorescence microscopy ($\\partial \\mu$) which\nincludes a realistic generalizable forward model with learnable-physical\nparameters (e.g. illumination patterns), and a novel physics-inspired inverse\nmodel. The cascaded model is end-to-end differentiable and can learn optimal\ncompressive sampling schemes through training data. With our model, we\nperformed thousands of numerical experiments on various compressive microscope\nconfigurations. Our results suggest that learned sampling outperforms widely\nused traditional compressive sampling schemes at higher compressions ($\\times\n100- 1000$) in terms of reconstruction quality. We further utilize our\nframework for Task Aware Compression. The experimental results show superior\nperformance on segmentation tasks even at extremely high compression ($\\times\n4096$).",
