    "title": "Are Evolutionary Algorithms Safe Optimizers?",
    "abstract": "We consider a type of constrained optimization problem, where the violation\nof a constraint leads to an irrevocable loss, such as breakage of a valuable\nexperimental resource/platform or loss of human life. Such problems are\nreferred to as safe optimization problems (SafeOPs). While SafeOPs have\nreceived attention in the machine learning community in recent years, there was\nlittle interest in the evolutionary computation (EC) community despite some\nearly attempts between 2009 and 2011. Moreover, there is a lack of acceptable\nguidelines on how to benchmark different algorithms for SafeOPs, an area where\nthe EC community has significant experience in. Driven by the need for more\nefficient algorithms and benchmark guidelines for SafeOPs, the objective of\nthis paper is to reignite the interest of this problem class in the EC\ncommunity. To achieve this we (i) provide a formal definition of SafeOPs and\ncontrast it to other types of optimization problems that the EC community is\nfamiliar with, (ii) investigate the impact of key SafeOP parameters on the\nperformance of selected safe optimization algorithms, (iii) benchmark EC\nagainst state-of-the-art safe optimization algorithms from the machine learning\ncommunity, and (iv) provide an open-source Python framework to replicate and\nextend our work.",

    "abstract": "We present a hybrid classical-quantum framework based on the Frank-Wolfe\nalgorithm, Q-FW, for solving quadratic, linearly-constrained, binary\noptimization problems on quantum annealers (QA). The computational premise of\nquantum computers has cultivated the re-design of various existing vision\nproblems into quantum-friendly forms. Experimental QA realizations can solve a\nparticular non-convex problem known as the quadratic unconstrained binary\noptimization (QUBO). Yet a naive-QUBO cannot take into account the restrictions\non the parameters. To introduce additional structure in the parameter space,\nresearchers have crafted ad-hoc solutions incorporating (linear) constraints in\nthe form of regularizers. However, this comes at the expense of a\nhyper-parameter, balancing the impact of regularization. To date, a true\nconstrained solver of quadratic binary optimization (QBO) problems has lacked.\nQ-FW first reformulates constrained-QBO as a copositive program (CP), then\nemploys Frank-Wolfe iterations to solve CP while satisfying linear (in)equality\nconstraints. This procedure unrolls the original constrained-QBO into a set of\nunconstrained QUBOs all of which are solved, in a sequel, on a QA. We use\nD-Wave Advantage QA to conduct synthetic and real experiments on two important\ncomputer vision problems, graph matching and permutation synchronization, which\ndemonstrate that our approach is effective in alleviating the need for an\nexplicit regularization coefficient.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms can perform well when trained on large datasets.\nWhile large organisations often have considerable data assets, it can be\ndifficult for these assets to be unified in a manner that makes training\npossible. Data is very often 'siloed' in different parts of the organisation,\nwith little to no access between silos. This fragmentation of data assets is\nespecially prevalent in heavily regulated industries like financial services or\nhealthcare. In this paper we propose a framework to enable asynchronous\ncollaborative training of machine learning models across data silos. This\nallows data science teams to collaboratively train a machine learning model,\nwithout sharing data with one another. Our proposed approach enhances\nconventional federated learning techniques to make them suitable for this\nasynchronous training in this intra-organisation, cross-silo setting.

    "abstract": "Transformer has brought great success to a wide range of natural language\nprocessing tasks. Nevertheless, the computational overhead of the vanilla\ntransformer scales quadratically with sequence length. Many efforts have been\nmade to develop more efficient transformer variants. A line of work (e.g.,\nLinformer) projects the input sequence into a low-rank space, achieving linear\ntime complexity. However, Linformer does not suit well for text generation\ntasks as the sequence length must be pre-specified. We propose MemSizer, an\napproach also projects the source sequence into lower dimension representation\nbut can take input with dynamic length, with a different perspective of the\nattention mechanism. MemSizer not only achieves the same linear time complexity\nbut also enjoys efficient recurrent-style autoregressive generation, which\nyields constant memory complexity and reduced computation at inference. We\ndemonstrate that MemSizer provides an improved tradeoff between efficiency and\naccuracy over the vanilla transformer and other linear variants in language\nmodeling and machine translation tasks, revealing a viable direction towards\nfurther inference efficiency improvement.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce two schemes to construct reusable garbled circuits\n(RGCs) in the semi-honest setting. Our completely reusable garbled circuit\n(CRGC) scheme allows the generator (party A) to construct and send an\nobfuscated boolean circuit along with an encoded input to the evaluator (Party\nB). In contrast to Yao's garbled circuit protocol, the evaluator can securely\nevaluate the same CRGC with an arbitrary number of inputs. As a tradeoff, CRGCs\ncome with predictable input bit leakage. We also propose a partially reusable\ngarbled circuit (PRGC) scheme that divides a circuit into reusable and\nnon-reusable sections. PRGCs do not leak input bits of the generator. We\nbenchmark our CRGC implementation against the state-of-the-art Yao's Garbled\nCircuit libraries EMP SH2PC and TinyGarble2. Using our framework, evaluating a\nCRGC is up to twenty times faster than evaluating an equivalent Yao's Garbled\nCircuit constructed by the two existing libraries. Our open-source library can\nconvert any C++ function to an RGC at approx. 80 million gates per second and\nrepeatedly evaluate a CRGC at approx. 350 million gates per second.\nAdditionally, a compressed CRGC is approx. 75% smaller in file size than the\nunobfuscated boolean circuit.",

In this paper, we address the problem of localizing in an indoor\nenvironment that changes and where prominent structures have no correspondence\nin the map built at a different point in time. To overcome the discrepancy\nbetween the map and the observed environment caused by such changes, we exploit\nhuman-readable localization cues to assist localization. These cues are readily\navailable in most facilities and can be detected using RGB camera images by\nutilizing text spotting. We integrate these cues into a Monte Carlo\nlocalization framework using a particle filter that operates on 2D LiDAR scans\nand camera data. By this, we provide a robust localization solution for\nenvironments with structural changes and dynamics by humans walking. We\nevaluate our localization framework on multiple challenging indoor scenarios in\nan office environment. The experiments suggest that our approach is robust to\nstructural changes and can run on an onboard computer.

These models\naccount for the mutual information between the (current) visual information and\nits estimated causes. However, they fail to consider the circular causality\nbetween perception and action. In other words, they do not consider where to\nsample next, given current beliefs. Here, we reclaim salience as an active\ninference process that relies on two basic principles: uncertainty minimisation\nand rhythmic scheduling. For this, we make a distinction between attention and\nsalience. Briefly, we associate attention with precision control, i.e., the\nconfidence with which beliefs can be updated given sampled sensory data, and\nsalience with uncertainty minimisation that underwrites the selection of future\nsensory data. Using this, we propose a new account of attention based on\nrhythmic precision-modulation and discuss its potential in robotics, providing\nnumerical experiments that showcase advantages of precision-modulation for\nstate and noise estimation, system identification and action selection for\ninformative path planning.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel scene flow method that captures 3D motions from point\nclouds without relying on ground-truth scene flow annotations. Due to the\nirregularity and sparsity of point clouds, it is expensive and time-consuming\nto acquire ground-truth scene flow annotations. Some state-of-the-art\napproaches train scene flow networks in a self-supervised learning manner via\napproximating pseudo scene flow labels from point clouds. However, these\nmethods fail to achieve the performance level of fully supervised methods, due\nto the limitations of point cloud such as sparsity and lacking color\ninformation. To provide an alternative, we propose a novel approach that\nutilizes monocular RGB images and point clouds to generate pseudo scene flow\nlabels for training scene flow networks. Our pseudo label generation module\ninfers pseudo scene labels for point clouds by jointly leveraging rich\nappearance information in monocular images and geometric information of point\nclouds. To further reduce the negative effect of noisy pseudo labels on the\ntraining, we propose a noisy-label-aware training scheme by exploiting the\ngeometric relations of points.

    "abstract": "Unified Virtual Memory (UVM) relieves the developers from the onus of\nmaintaining complex data structures and explicit data migration by enabling\non-demand data movement between CPU memory and GPU memory. However, on-demand\npaging soon becomes a performance bottleneck of UVM due to the high latency\ncaused by page table walks and data migration over interconnect. Prefetching is\nconsidered a promising solution to this problem given its ability to leverage\nthe locality of program memory access patterns. However, existing\nlocality-based prefetching schemes can not handle all the situations. %Data\nstructures like arrays tend to be stored in contiguous blocks, and accessed\nrepeatedly. An ideal prefetcher should not only look at narrow regions of the\nrequested address space but also capture global context to deliver a good\nprediction of the memory access pattern.\nThis paper proposes a novel approach for page prefetching for UVM through\ndeep learning. We first show that a powerful Transformer learning model can\nprovide high accuracy for UVM page prefetching. We then perform analysis to\ninterpret this Transformer model and derive several insights that allow us to\ndesign a simpler model to match the unconstrained model's accuracy with orders\nof magnitude lower cost. We evaluate this simplified model on a set of 11\nmemory-intensive benchmarks from popular benchmark suites.

    "abstract": "In recent years, human casualties and damage to resources caused by emergent\nincidents have become a serious problem worldwide. In this paper, we model the\nemergency decision-making problem and use Multi-agent System (MAS) to solve the\nproblem that the decision speed cannot keep up with the spreading speed. MAS\ncan play an important role in the automated execution of these tasks to reduce\nmission completion time. In this paper, we propose a P-MADDPG algorithm to\nsolve the emergency decision-making problem of emergent incidents, which\npredicts the nodes where an incident may occur in the next time by GRU model\nand makes decisions before the incident occurs, thus solving the problem that\nthe decision speed cannot keep up with the spreading speed. A simulation\nenvironment was established for realistic scenarios, and three scenarios were\nselected to test the performance of P-MADDPG in emergency decision-making\nproblems for emergent incidents: unmanned storage, factory assembly line, and\ncivil airport baggage transportation. Simulation results using the P-MADDPG\nalgorithm are compared with the greedy algorithm and the MADDPG algorithm, and\nthe final experimental results show that the P-MADDPG algorithm converges\nfaster and better than the other algorithms in scenarios of different sizes.\nThis shows that the P-MADDP algorithm is effective for emergency\ndecision-making in emergent incident.",

    "title": "A Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Caching Strategy for IoT Networks  with Transient Data",
    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has been continuously rising in the past few\nyears, and its potentials are now more apparent. However, transient data\ngeneration and limited energy resources are the major bottlenecks of these\nnetworks. Besides, minimum delay and other conventional quality of service\nmeasurements are still valid requirements to meet. An efficient caching policy\ncan help meet the standard quality of service requirements while bypassing IoT\nnetworks' specific limitations. Adopting deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nalgorithms enables us to develop an effective caching scheme without the need\nfor any prior knowledge or contextual information. In this work, we propose a\nDRL-based caching scheme that improves the cache hit rate and reduces energy\nconsumption of the IoT networks, in the meanwhile, taking data freshness and\nlimited lifetime of IoT data into account. To better capture the\nregional-different popularity distribution, we propose a hierarchical\narchitecture to deploy edge caching nodes in IoT networks. The results of\ncomprehensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms the\nwell-known conventional caching policies and an existing DRL-based solution in\nterms of cache hit rate and energy consumption of the IoT networks by\nconsiderable margins.",

    "abstract": "We study how the choice of visual perspective affects learning and\ngeneralization in the context of physical manipulation from raw sensor\nobservations. Compared with the more commonly used global third-person\nperspective, a hand-centric (eye-in-hand) perspective affords reduced\nobservability, but we find that it consistently improves training efficiency\nand out-of-distribution generalization. These benefits hold across a variety of\nlearning algorithms, experimental settings, and distribution shifts, and for\nboth simulated and real robot apparatuses. However, this is only the case when\nhand-centric observability is sufficient; otherwise, including a third-person\nperspective is necessary for learning, but also harms out-of-distribution\ngeneralization. To mitigate this, we propose to regularize the third-person\ninformation stream via a variational information bottleneck. On six\nrepresentative manipulation tasks with varying hand-centric observability\nadapted from the Meta-World benchmark, this results in a state-of-the-art\nreinforcement learning agent operating from both perspectives improving its\nout-of-distribution generalization on every task. While some practitioners have\nlong put cameras in the hands of robots, our work systematically analyzes the\nbenefits of doing so and provides simple and broadly applicable insights for\nimproving end-to-end learned vision-based robotic manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning have enabled optimization of deep reactive\npolicies (DRPs) for continuous MDP planning by encoding a parametric policy as\na deep neural network and exploiting automatic differentiation in an end-to-end\nmodel-based gradient descent framework. This approach has proven effective for\noptimizing DRPs in nonlinear continuous MDPs, but it requires a large number of\nsampled trajectories to learn effectively and can suffer from high variance in\nsolution quality. In this work, we revisit the overall model-based DRP\nobjective and instead take a minorization-maximization perspective to\niteratively optimize the DRP w.r.t. a locally tight lower-bounded objective.\nThis novel formulation of DRP learning as iterative lower bound optimization\n(ILBO) is particularly appealing because (i) each step is structurally easier\nto optimize than the overall objective, (ii) it guarantees a monotonically\nimproving objective under certain theoretical conditions, and (iii) it reuses\nsamples between iterations thus lowering sample complexity. Empirical\nevaluation confirms that ILBO is significantly more sample-efficient than the\nstate-of-the-art DRP planner and consistently produces better solution quality\nwith lower variance. We additionally demonstrate that ILBO generalizes well to\nnew problem instances (i.e., different initial states) without requiring\nretraining.",

    "title": "Revisiting Multi-Scale Feature Fusion for Semantic Segmentation",
    "abstract": "It is commonly believed that high internal resolution combined with expensive\noperations (e.g. atrous convolutions) are necessary for accurate semantic\nsegmentation, resulting in slow speed and large memory usage. In this paper, we\nquestion this belief and demonstrate that neither high internal resolution nor\natrous convolutions are necessary. Our intuition is that although segmentation\nis a dense per-pixel prediction task, the semantics of each pixel often depend\non both nearby neighbors and far-away context; therefore, a more powerful\nmulti-scale feature fusion network plays a critical role. Following this\nintuition, we revisit the conventional multi-scale feature space (typically\ncapped at P5) and extend it to a much richer space, up to P9, where the\nsmallest features are only 1/512 of the input size and thus have very large\nreceptive fields. To process such a rich feature space, we leverage the recent\nBiFPN to fuse the multi-scale features. Based on these insights, we develop a\nsimplified segmentation model, named ESeg, which has neither high internal\nresolution nor expensive atrous convolutions. Perhaps surprisingly, our simple\nmethod can achieve better accuracy with faster speed than prior art across\nmultiple datasets. In real-time settings, ESeg-Lite-S achieves 76.0% mIoU on\nCityScapes [12] at 189 FPS, outperforming FasterSeg [9] (73.1% mIoU at 170\nFPS). Our ESeg-Lite-L runs at 79 FPS and achieves 80.1% mIoU, largely closing\nthe gap between real-time and high-performance segmentation models.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning algorithms struggle on tasks with complex hierarchical\ndependency structures. Humans and other intelligent agents do not waste time\nassessing the utility of every high-level action in existence, but instead only\nconsider ones they deem possible in the first place. By focusing only on what\nis feasible, or \"afforded\", at the present moment, an agent can spend more time\nboth evaluating the utility of and acting on what matters. To this end, we\npresent Hierarchical Affordance Learning (HAL), a method that learns a model of\nhierarchical affordances in order to prune impossible subtasks for more\neffective learning. Existing works in hierarchical reinforcement learning\nprovide agents with structural representations of subtasks but are not\naffordance-aware, and by grounding our definition of hierarchical affordances\nin the present state, our approach is more flexible than the multitude of\napproaches that ground their subtask dependencies in a symbolic history. While\nthese logic-based methods often require complete knowledge of the subtask\nhierarchy, our approach is able to utilize incomplete and varying symbolic\nspecifications. Furthermore, we demonstrate that relative to\nnon-affordance-aware methods, HAL agents are better able to efficiently learn\ncomplex tasks, navigate environment stochasticity, and acquire diverse skills\nin the absence of extrinsic supervision -- all of which are hallmarks of human\nlearning.",

    "abstract": "As AI-enhanced technologies become common in a variety of domains, there is\nan increasing need to define and examine the trust that users have in such\ntechnologies. Given the progress in the development of AI, a correspondingly\nsophisticated understanding of trust in the technology is required. This paper\naddresses this need by explaining the role of trust on the intention to use AI\ntechnologies. Study 1 examined the role of trust in the use of AI voice\nassistants based on survey responses from college students. A path analysis\nconfirmed that trust had a significant effect on the intention to use AI, which\noperated through perceived usefulness and participants' attitude toward voice\nassistants. In study 2, using data from a representative sample of the U.S.\npopulation, different dimensions of trust were examined using exploratory\nfactor analysis, which yielded two dimensions: human-like trust and\nfunctionality trust. The results of the path analyses from Study 1 were\nreplicated in Study 2, confirming the indirect effect of trust and the effects\nof perceived usefulness, ease of use, and attitude on intention to use.\nFurther, both dimensions of trust shared a similar pattern of effects within\nthe model, with functionality-related trust exhibiting a greater total impact\non usage intention than human-like trust. Overall, the role of trust in the\nacceptance of AI technologies was significant across both studies. This\nresearch contributes to the advancement and application of the TAM in\nAI-related applications and offers a multidimensional measure of trust that can\nbe utilized in the future study of trustworthy AI.",

    "title": "RILI: Robustly Influencing Latent Intent",
    "abstract": "When robots interact with human partners, often these partners change their\nbehavior in response to the robot. On the one hand this is challenging because\nthe robot must learn to coordinate with a dynamic partner. But on the other\nhand -- if the robot understands these dynamics -- it can harness its own\nbehavior, influence the human, and guide the team towards effective\ncollaboration. Prior research enables robots to learn to influence other robots\nor simulated agents. In this paper we extend these learning approaches to now\ninfluence humans. What makes humans especially hard to influence is that -- not\nonly do humans react to the robot -- but the way a single user reacts to the\nrobot may change over time, and different humans will respond to the same robot\nbehavior in different ways. We therefore propose a robust approach that learns\nto influence changing partner dynamics. Our method first trains with a set of\npartners across repeated interactions, and learns to predict the current\npartner's behavior based on the previous states, actions, and rewards. Next, we\nrapidly adapt to new partners by sampling trajectories the robot learned with\nthe original partners, and then leveraging those existing behaviors to\ninfluence the new partner dynamics. We compare our resulting algorithm to\nstate-of-the-art baselines across simulated environments and a user study where\nthe robot and participants collaborate to build towers. We find that our\napproach outperforms the alternatives, even when the partner follows new or\nunexpected dynamics. Videos of the user study are available here:\nhttps://youtu.be/lYsWM8An18g",

    "abstract": "Unpaired image-to-image translation (I2I) is an ill-posed problem, as an\ninfinite number of translation functions can map the source domain distribution\nto the target distribution. Therefore, much effort has been put into designing\nsuitable constraints, e.g., cycle consistency (CycleGAN), geometry consistency\n(GCGAN), and contrastive learning-based constraints (CUTGAN), that help better\npose the problem. However, these well-known constraints have limitations: (1)\nthey are either too restrictive or too weak for specific I2I tasks; (2) these\nmethods result in content distortion when there is a significant spatial\nvariation between the source and target domains. This paper proposes a\nuniversal regularization technique called maximum spatial perturbation\nconsistency (MSPC), which enforces a spatial perturbation function (T ) and the\ntranslation operator (G) to be commutative (i.e., TG = GT ). In addition, we\nintroduce two adversarial training components for learning the spatial\nperturbation function. The first one lets T compete with G to achieve maximum\nperturbation. The second one lets G and T compete with discriminators to align\nthe spatial variations caused by the change of object size, object distortion,\nbackground interruptions, etc. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods on most I2I benchmarks. We also introduce a new benchmark, namely the\nfront face to profile face dataset, to emphasize the underlying challenges of\nI2I for real-world applications. We finally perform ablation experiments to\nstudy the sensitivity of our method to the severity of spatial perturbation and\nits effectiveness for distribution alignment.",

    "title": "Adversarial Training for Improving Model Robustness? Look at Both  Prediction and Interpretation",
    "abstract": "Neural language models show vulnerability to adversarial examples which are\nsemantically similar to their original counterparts with a few words replaced\nby their synonyms. A common way to improve model robustness is adversarial\ntraining which follows two steps-collecting adversarial examples by attacking a\ntarget model, and fine-tuning the model on the augmented dataset with these\nadversarial examples. The objective of traditional adversarial training is to\nmake a model produce the same correct predictions on an original/adversarial\nexample pair. However, the consistency between model decision-makings on two\nsimilar texts is ignored. We argue that a robust model should behave\nconsistently on original/adversarial example pairs, that is making the same\npredictions (what) based on the same reasons (how) which can be reflected by\nconsistent interpretations. In this work, we propose a novel feature-level\nadversarial training method named FLAT. FLAT aims at improving model robustness\nin terms of both predictions and interpretations. FLAT incorporates variational\nword masks in neural networks to learn global word importance and play as a\nbottleneck teaching the model to make predictions based on important words.\nFLAT explicitly shoots at the vulnerability problem caused by the mismatch\nbetween model understandings on the replaced words and their synonyms in\noriginal/adversarial example pairs by regularizing the corresponding global\nword importance scores. Experiments show the effectiveness of FLAT in improving\nthe robustness with respect to both predictions and interpretations of four\nneural network models (LSTM, CNN, BERT, and DeBERTa) to two adversarial attacks\non four text classification tasks. The models trained via FLAT also show better\nrobustness than baseline models on unforeseen adversarial examples across\ndifferent attacks.",

    "title": "The Challenges of Continuous Self-Supervised Learning",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) aims to eliminate one of the major bottlenecks\nin representation learning - the need for human annotations. As a result, SSL\nholds the promise to learn representations from data in-the-wild, i.e., without\nthe need for finite and static datasets. Instead, true SSL algorithms should be\nable to exploit the continuous stream of data being generated on the internet\nor by agents exploring their environments. But do traditional self-supervised\nlearning approaches work in this setup? In this work, we investigate this\nquestion by conducting experiments on the continuous self-supervised learning\nproblem. While learning in the wild, we expect to see a continuous (infinite)\nnon-IID data stream that follows a non-stationary distribution of visual\nconcepts. The goal is to learn a representation that can be robust, adaptive\nyet not forgetful of concepts seen in the past. We show that a direct\napplication of current methods to such continuous setup is 1) inefficient both\ncomputationally and in the amount of data required, 2) leads to inferior\nrepresentations due to temporal correlations (non-IID data) in some sources of\nstreaming data and 3) exhibits signs of catastrophic forgetting when trained on\nsources with non-stationary data distributions. We propose the use of replay\nbuffers as an approach to alleviate the issues of inefficiency and temporal\ncorrelations. We further propose a novel method to enhance the replay buffer by\nmaintaining the least redundant samples. Minimum redundancy (MinRed) buffers\nallow us to learn effective representations even in the most challenging\nstreaming scenarios composed of sequential visual data obtained from a single\nembodied agent, and alleviates the problem of catastrophic forgetting when\nlearning from data with non-stationary semantic distributions.",

    "abstract": "Memory bloat is an important source of inefficiency in complex production\nsoftware, especially in software written in managed languages such as Java.\nPrior approaches to this problem have focused on identifying objects that\noutlive their life span. Few studies have, however, looked into whether and to\nwhat extent myriad objects of the same type are identical. A quantitative\nassessment of identical objects with code-level attribution can assist\ndevelopers in refactoring code to eliminate object bloat, and favor reuse of\nexisting object(s). The result is reduced memory pressure, reduced allocation\nand garbage collection, enhanced data locality, and reduced re-computation, all\nof which result in superior performance.\nWe develop OJXPerf, a lightweight sampling-based profiler, which\nprobabilistically identifies identical objects. OJXPerf employs hardware\nperformance monitoring units (PMU) in conjunction with hardware debug registers\nto sample and compare field values of different objects of the same type\nallocated at the same calling context but potentially accessed at different\nprogram points. The result is a lightweight measurement, a combination of\nobject allocation contexts and usage contexts ordered by duplication frequency.\nThis class of duplicated objects is relatively easier to optimize. OJXPerf\nincurs 9% runtime and 6% memory overheads on average. We empirically show the\nbenefit of OJXPerf by using its profiles to instruct us to optimize a number of\nJava programs, including well-known benchmarks and real-world applications. The\nresults show a noticeable reduction in memory usage (up to 11%) and a\nsignificant speedup (up to 25%).",

In this work, we argue that image token masking is fundamentally\ndifferent from token masking in text, due to the amount and correlation of\ntokens in an image. In particular, to generate a challenging pretext task for\nMIM, we advocate a shift from random masking to informed masking. We develop\nand exhibit this idea in the context of distillation-based MIM, where a teacher\ntransformer encoder generates an attention map, which we use to guide masking\nfor the student encoder. We thus introduce a novel masking strategy, called\nattention-guided masking (AttMask), and we demonstrate its effectiveness over\nrandom masking for dense distillation-based MIM as well as plain\ndistillation-based self-supervised learning on classification tokens. We\nconfirm that AttMask accelerates the learning process and improves the\nperformance on a variety of downstream tasks.",

    "abstract": "Graph edge partitioning is an important preprocessing step to optimize\ndistributed computing jobs on graph-structured data. The edge set of a given\ngraph is split into $k$ equally-sized partitions, such that the replication of\nvertices across partitions is minimized. Out-of-core edge partitioning\nalgorithms are able to tackle the problem with low memory overhead. Exsisting\nout-of-core algorithms mainly work in a streaming manner and can be grouped\ninto two types. While \\emph{stateless} streaming edge partitioning is fast and\nyields low partitioning quality, stateful streaming edge partitioning yields\nbetter quality, but is expensive, as it requires a scoring function to be\nevaluated for every edge on every partition, leading to a time complexity of\n$\\mathcal{O}(|E|*k)$. In this paper, we propose 2PS-L, a novel out-of-core edge\npartitioning algorithm that builds upon the stateful streaming model, but\nachieves linear run-time (i.e., $\\mathcal{O}(|E|)$). 2PS-L consists of two\nphases. In the first phase, vertices are separated into clusters by a\nlightweight streaming clustering algorithm. In the second phase, the graph is\nre-streamed and vertex clustering from the first phase is exploited to reduce\nthe search space of graph partitioning to only two target partitions for every\nedge. Our evaluations show that 2PS-L can achieve better partitioning quality\nthan existing stateful streaming edge partitioners while having a much lower\nrun-time. As a consequence, the total run-time of partitioning and subsequent\ndistributed graph processing can be significantly reduced.",

However, existing algorithms face issues\nwith slow convergence and/or robustness of performance due to the considerable\nheterogeneity of data distribution, computation and communication capability at\nthe edge. In this work, we tackle both of these issues by focusing on the key\ncomponent of model aggregation in federated learning systems and studying\noptimal algorithms to perform this task. Particularly, we propose a contextual\naggregation scheme that achieves the optimal context-dependent bound on loss\nreduction in each round of optimization.

Our experimental results demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in convergence speed and robustness of the contextual\nversions compared to the original algorithms.

    "abstract": "Collaborative robots are expected to physically interact with humans in daily\nliving and workplace, including industrial and healthcare settings. A related\nkey enabling technology is tactile sensing, which currently requires addressing\nthe outstanding scientific challenge to simultaneously detect contact location\nand intensity by means of soft conformable artificial skins adapting over large\nareas to the complex curved geometries of robot embodiments. In this work, the\ndevelopment of a large-area sensitive soft skin with a curved geometry is\npresented, allowing for robot total-body coverage through modular patches. The\nbiomimetic skin consists of a soft polymeric matrix, resembling a human\nforearm, embedded with photonic Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) transducers, which\npartially mimics Ruffini mechanoreceptor functionality with diffuse,\noverlapping receptive fields. A Convolutional Neural Network deep learning\nalgorithm and a multigrid Neuron Integration Process were implemented to decode\nthe FBG sensor outputs for inferring contact force magnitude and localization\nthrough the skin surface. Results achieved 35 mN (IQR = 56 mN) and 3.2 mm (IQR\n= 2.3 mm) median errors, for force and localization predictions, respectively.\nDemonstrations with an anthropomorphic arm pave the way towards AI-based\nintegrated skins enabling safe human-robot cooperation via machine\nintelligence.",

    "abstract": "Neural program repair has achieved good results in a recent series of papers.\nYet, we observe that the related work fails to repair some bugs because of a\nlack of knowledge about 1) the program being repaired, and 2) the actual fault\nbeing repaired. In this paper, we solve both problems by changing the learning\nparadigm from supervised training to self-supervised training in an approach\ncalled SelfAPR. First, SelfAPR generates and constructs training samples by\nperturbing a previous version of the program being repaired, enforcing the\nneural model to capture project-specific knowledge. This is different from all\nthe existing work based on past commits. Second, SelfAPR extracts and encodes\ntest execution diagnostics into the input representation, steering the neural\nmodel to fix the specific kind of fault. This is different from the existing\nstudies that only consider static source code in the input. We implement\nSelfAPR and evaluate it in a systematic manner. We train SelfAPR with 253 411\ntraining samples obtained by perturbing 17 open-source projects. We evaluate\nSelfAPR on 818 bugs from Defects4J, SelfAPR correctly repairs 112 of them.",

    "abstract": "Increasingly larger and better Transformer models keep advancing\nstate-of-the-art accuracy and capability for Natural Language Processing\napplications. These models demand more computational power, storage, and\nenergy. Mokey reduces the footprint of state-of-the-art 32-bit or 16-bit\nfloating-point transformer models by quantizing all values to 4-bit indexes\ninto dictionaries of representative 16-bit fixed-point centroids. Mokey does\nnot need fine-tuning, an essential feature as often the training resources or\ndatasets are not available to many. Exploiting the range of values that\nnaturally occur in transformer models, Mokey selects centroid values to also\nfit an exponential curve. This unique feature enables Mokey to replace the bulk\nof the original multiply-accumulate operations with narrow 3b fixed-point\nadditions resulting in an area- and energy-efficient hardware accelerator\ndesign. Over a set of state-of-the-art transformer models, the Mokey\naccelerator delivers an order of magnitude improvements in energy efficiency\nover a Tensor Cores-based accelerator while improving performance by at least\n$4\\times$ and as much as $15\\times$ depending on the model and on-chip\nbuffering capacity.

    "abstract": "An oft-ignored challenge of real-world reinforcement learning is that the\nreal world does not pause when agents make learning updates. As standard\nsimulated environments do not address this real-time aspect of learning, most\navailable implementations of RL algorithms process environment interactions and\nlearning updates sequentially. As a consequence, when such implementations are\ndeployed in the real world, they may make decisions based on significantly\ndelayed observations and not act responsively. Asynchronous learning has been\nproposed to solve this issue, but no systematic comparison between sequential\nand asynchronous reinforcement learning was conducted using real-world\nenvironments. In this work, we set up two vision-based tasks with a robotic\narm, implement an asynchronous learning system that extends a previous\narchitecture, and compare sequential and asynchronous reinforcement learning\nacross different action cycle times, sensory data dimensions, and mini-batch\nsizes. Our experiments show that when the time cost of learning updates\nincreases, the action cycle time in sequential implementation could grow\nexcessively long, while the asynchronous implementation can always maintain an\nappropriate action cycle time. Consequently, when learning updates are\nexpensive, the performance of sequential learning diminishes and is\noutperformed by asynchronous learning by a substantial margin. Our system\nlearns in real-time to reach and track visual targets from pixels within two\nhours of experience and does so directly using real robots, learning completely\nfrom scratch.",

To\ndetect bugs in these games' models, human testers play the games repeatedly to\nexplore the game and find errors in the games. Such game play is exhaustive and\ntime consuming. Moreover, since robotics simulators depend on similar methods\nof model specification and debugging, the problem of finding errors in the\nmodel is of interest for the robotics community to ensure robot behaviors and\ninteractions are consistent in simulators. Previous methods have used\nreinforcement learning and search based methods including Rapidly-exploring\nRandom Trees (RRT) to explore a game's state-action space to find bugs.\nHowever, such search and exploration based methods are not efficient at\nexploring the state-action space without a pre-defined heuristic.

The other one considers ZSM as a complementary\nsystem for the standard 3GPP Management System. From these deployment options,\nsome key questions are identified on ZSM's interoperability with the existing\n3GPP Network Slicing systems.

Machine learning has emerged as viable approach to help\nsoftware developers generate automated unit tests.

Standard language modeling metrics\nsuch as perplexity quantify the performance of language models (LM) in\naggregate. As a result, we have relatively little understanding of whether\nneural LMs accurately estimate the probability of sequences in this heavy-tail\nof rare events. To address this gap, we develop a controlled evaluation scheme\nwhich uses generative models trained on natural data as artificial languages\nfrom which we can exactly compute sequence probabilities. Training LMs on\ngenerations from these artificial languages, we compare the sequence-level\nprobability estimates given by LMs to the true probabilities in the target\nlanguage.

In this paper, we propose\nDPar2, a fast and scalable PARAFAC2 decomposition method for irregular dense\ntensors. DPar2 achieves high efficiency by effectively compressing each slice\nmatrix of a given irregular tensor, careful reordering of computations with the\ncompression results, and exploiting the irregularity of the tensor. Extensive\nexperiments show that DPar2 is up to 6.0x faster than competitors on real-world\nirregular tensors while achieving comparable accuracy. In addition, DPar2 is\nscalable with respect to the tensor size and target rank.",

    "abstract": "Research has shown that most resources shared in articles (e.g., URLs to code\nor data) are not kept up to date and mostly disappear from the web after some\nyears (Zeng et al., 2019). Little is known about the factors that differentiate\nand predict the longevity of these resources. This article explores a range of\nexplanatory features related to the publication venue, authors, references, and\nwhere the resource is shared. We analyze an extensive repository of\npublications and, through web archival services, reconstruct how they looked at\ndifferent time points. We discover that the most important factors are related\nto where and how the resource is shared, and surprisingly little is explained\nby the author's reputation or prestige of the journal. By examining the places\nwhere long-lasting resources are shared, we suggest that it is critical to\ndisseminate and create standards with modern technologies. Finally, we discuss\nimplications for reproducibility and recognizing scientific datasets as\nfirst-class citizens.",

Therefore, it is important to\ncontrol the operation of the system to accurately grasp the operation status of\nthe system and find out the failure in time. The occurrence of system failure\nis a gradual process, and the occurrence of the current system failure may\ndepend on the previous state of the system, which is sequential.

In order to guide the technical personnel to troubleshoot and\nsolve related faults, in this paper, an industrial fault diagnosis system is\nimplemented based on the cubic DUCG theory.

Monocular camera re-localization refers to the task of estimating\nthe absolute camera pose from an instance image in a known environment, which\nhas been intensively studied for alternative localization in GPS-denied\nenvironments. In recent works, camera re-localization methods are trained via\nsupervised learning from pairs of camera images and camera poses. In contrast\nto previous works, we propose a completely unsupervised learning framework for\ncamera re-localization and depth estimation, requiring only monocular video\nsequences for training. In our framework, we train two networks that estimate\nthe scene coordinates using directions and the depth map from each image which\nare then combined to estimate the camera pose. The networks can be trained\nthrough the minimization of loss functions based on our loop closed view\nsynthesis. In experiments with the 7-scenes dataset, the proposed method\noutperformed the re-localization of the state-of-the-art visual SLAM,\nORB-SLAM3.

    "abstract": "Non-parallel data voice conversion (VC) have achieved considerable\nbreakthroughs recently through introducing bottleneck features (BNFs) extracted\nby the automatic speech recognition(ASR) model. However, selection of BNFs have\na significant impact on VC result. For example, when extracting BNFs from ASR\ntrained with Cross Entropy loss (CE-BNFs) and feeding into neural network to\ntrain a VC system, the timbre similarity of converted speech is significantly\ndegraded. If BNFs are extracted from ASR trained using Connectionist Temporal\nClassification loss (CTC-BNFs), the naturalness of the converted speech may\ndecrease. This phenomenon is caused by the difference of information contained\nin BNFs. In this paper, we proposed an any-to-one VC method using hybrid\nbottleneck features extracted from CTC-BNFs and CE-BNFs to complement each\nother advantages. Gradient reversal layer and instance normalization were used\nto extract prosody information from CE-BNFs and content information from\nCTC-BNFs. Auto-regressive decoder and Hifi-GAN vocoder were used to generate\nhigh-quality waveform. Experimental results show that our proposed method\nachieves higher similarity, naturalness, quality than baseline method and\nreveals the differences between the information contained in CE-BNFs and\nCTC-BNFs as well as the influence they have on the converted speech.",

In this paper, we present the\nDoubly Slimmable Transformer (DST), a general framework that can be seamlessly\nintegrated into arbitrary Transformer-based VQA models to train one single\nmodel once and obtain various slimmed submodels of different widths and depths.\nTaking two typical Transformer-based VQA approaches, i.e., MCAN and UNITER, as\nthe reference models, the obtained slimmable MCAN_DST and UNITER_DST models\noutperform the state-of-the-art methods trained independently on two benchmark\ndatasets.

    "abstract": "Recently, several Vision Transformer (ViT) based methods have been proposed\nfor Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC).These methods significantly\nsurpass existing CNN-based ones, demonstrating the effectiveness of ViT in FGVC\ntasks.However, there are some limitations when applying ViT directly to\nFGVC.First, ViT needs to split images into patches and calculate the attention\nof every pair, which may result in heavy redundant calculation and unsatisfying\nperformance when handling fine-grained images with complex background and small\nobjects.Second, a standard ViT only utilizes the class token in the final layer\nfor classification, which is not enough to extract comprehensive fine-grained\ninformation. To address these issues, we propose a novel ViT based fine-grained\nobject discriminator for FGVC tasks, ViT-FOD for short. Specifically, besides a\nViT backbone, it further introduces three novel components, i.e, Attention\nPatch Combination (APC), Critical Regions Filter (CRF), and Complementary\nTokens Integration (CTI). Thereinto, APC pieces informative patches from two\nimages to generate a new image so that the redundant calculation can be\nreduced. CRF emphasizes tokens corresponding to discriminative regions to\ngenerate a new class token for subtle feature learning. To extract\ncomprehensive information, CTI integrates complementary information captured by\nclass tokens in different ViT layers. We conduct comprehensive experiments on\nwidely used datasets and the results demonstrate that ViT-FOD is able to\nachieve state-of-the-art performance.",

Gaming videos, which are a relatively new type of UGC videos, are\ncreated when skilled gamers post videos of their gameplay. These kinds of\nscreenshots of UGC gameplay videos have become extremely popular on major\nstreaming platforms like YouTube and Twitch. Synthetically-generated gaming\ncontent presents challenges to existing VQA algorithms, including those based\non natural scene/video statistics models. Synthetically generated gaming\ncontent presents different statistical behavior than naturalistic videos.

However, little work has been\ndone on understanding the quality of UGC gaming videos, and how it can be\ncharacterized and predicted. Towards boosting the progress of gaming video VQA\nmodel development, we conducted a comprehensive study of subjective and\nobjective VQA models on UGC gaming videos. To do this, we created a novel UGC\ngaming video resource, called the LIVE-YouTube Gaming video quality\n(LIVE-YT-Gaming) database, comprised of 600 real UGC gaming videos. We\nconducted a subjective human study on this data, yielding 18,600 human quality\nratings recorded by 61 human subjects.

This issue is magnified when people are interacting with objects and\ninstruments, for example playing the violin. Standard approaches for\npostprocessing use interpolation and smoothing functions to filter noise and\nfill gaps, but they cannot model highly non-linear motion.

To accelerate\nfurther research in this domain, we also open-source MAPdat, a new multi-modal\ndataset of 3D violin playing motion with music. We perform a comparison of\ndifferent standard machine learning models and perform analysis on input\nmodalities, sampling techniques, and audio and motion features.

In this work we\npresent a sampling-based approach that allows us to tackle the challenges of\nlarge and high-dimensional search spaces. This is done by performing informed\nsampling in the high-dimensional continuous space and incorporating potential\ninformation gain along edges in the reward estimation. This method rapidly\ngenerates a global path that maximizes information gain for the given path\nbudget constraints. We discuss the details of our implementation for an example\nuse case of searching for multiple objects of interest in a large search space\nusing a fixed-wing UAV with a forward-facing camera.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel style transfer method to quickly create a new visual\nproduct with a nice appearance for industrial designers' reference. Given a\nsource product, a target product, and an art style image, our method produces a\nneural warping field that warps the source shape to imitate the geometric style\nof the target and a neural texture transformation network that transfers the\nartistic style to the warped source product. Our model, Industrial Style\nTransfer (InST), consists of large-scale geometric warping (LGW) and\ninterest-consistency texture transfer (ICTT). LGW aims to explore an\nunsupervised transformation between the shape masks of the source and target\nproducts for fitting large-scale shape warping. Furthermore, we introduce a\nmask smoothness regularization term to prevent the abrupt changes of the\ndetails of the source product. ICTT introduces an interest regularization term\nto maintain important contents of the warped product when it is stylized by\nusing the art style image. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that InST\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple visual product design tasks,\ne.g., companies' snail logos and classical bottles (please see Fig. 1). To the\nbest of our knowledge, we are the first to extend the neural style transfer\nmethod to create industrial product appearances. Project page:\n\\ulr{https://jcyang98.github.io/InST/home.html}.

With sharing, it is crucial that patients can control who can\naccess their data and when, and guarantee the security and privacy of their\ndata. In current literature, various system models, cryptographic techniques\nand access control mechanisms are proposed which requires patient's consent\nbefore sharing. However, they mostly focus on patient is available to authorize\nthe access of the EHR upon requested. This is impractical given that the\npatient may not always be in a good state to provide this authorization, eg,\nbeing unconscious and requires immediate medical attention. To address this\ngap, this paper proposes an efficient and secure protocol for the\npre-delegation of authorization to multi-party for the access of the EHR when\npatient is unavailable to do so.

    "abstract": "Multiple-instance learning (MIL) provides an effective way to tackle the\nvideo anomaly detection problem by modeling it as a weakly supervised problem\nas the labels are usually only available at the video level while missing for\nframes due to expensive labeling cost. We propose to conduct novel Bayesian\nnon-parametric submodular video partition (BN-SVP) to significantly improve MIL\nmodel training that can offer a highly reliable solution for robust anomaly\ndetection in practical settings that include outlier segments or multiple types\nof abnormal events. BN-SVP essentially performs dynamic non-parametric\nhierarchical clustering with an enhanced self-transition that groups segments\nin a video into temporally consistent and semantically coherent hidden states\nthat can be naturally interpreted as scenes. Each segment is assumed to be\ngenerated through a non-parametric mixture process that allows variations of\nsegments within the same scenes to accommodate the dynamic and noisy nature of\nmany real-world surveillance videos. The scene and mixture component assignment\nof BN-SVP also induces a pairwise similarity among segments, resulting in\nnon-parametric construction of a submodular set function. Integrating this\nfunction with an MIL loss effectively exposes the model to a diverse set of\npotentially positive instances to improve its training. A greedy algorithm is\ndeveloped to optimize the submodular function and support efficient model\ntraining. Our theoretical analysis ensures a strong performance guarantee of\nthe proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is\ndemonstrated over multiple real-world anomaly video datasets with robust\ndetection performance.",

Our method consists of two\nsuccessive stages, a coarse matching followed by a fine localization of the\nkeypoints' correspondences prediction.

Prior work modifies images either from low-level manipulation,\nsuch as image inpainting or through manual edits via paintbrushes and\nscribbles, or from high-level manipulation, employing deep generative networks\nto output an image conditioned on high-level semantic input. In this study, we\npropose Semantic Image Manipulation with Background-guided Internal Learning\n(SIMBIL), which combines high-level and low-level manipulation. Specifically,\nusers can edit an image at the semantic level by applying changes on a scene\ngraph. Then our model manipulates the image at the pixel level according to the\nmodified scene graph. There are two major advantages of our approach. First,\nhigh-level manipulation of scene graphs requires less manual effort from the\nuser compared to manipulating raw image pixels. Second, our low-level internal\nlearning approach is scalable to images of various sizes without reliance on\nexternal visual datasets for training. We outperform the state-of-the-art in a\nquantitative and qualitative evaluation on the CLEVR and Visual Genome\ndatasets.

    "abstract": "Purpose: A core component of advancing cancer treatment research is assessing\nresponse to therapy. Doing so by hand, for example as per RECIST or RANO\ncriteria, is tedious, time-consuming, and can miss important tumor response\ninformation; most notably, they exclude non-target lesions. We wish to assess\nchange in a holistic fashion that includes all lesions, obtaining simple,\ninformative, and automated assessments of tumor progression or regression. Due\nto often low patient enrolments in clinical trials, we wish to make response\nassessments with small training sets. Deep neuroevolution (DNE) can produce\nradiology artificial intelligence (AI) that performs well on small training\nsets. Here we use DNE for function approximation that predicts progression\nversus regression of metastatic brain disease.\nMethods: We analyzed 50 pairs of MRI contrast-enhanced images as our training\nset. Half of these pairs, separated in time, qualified as disease progression,\nwhile the other 25 images constituted regression. We trained the parameters of\na relatively small CNN via mutations that consisted of random CNN weight\nadjustments and mutation fitness. We then incorporated the best mutations into\nthe next generations CNN, repeating this process for approximately 50,000\ngenerations. We applied the CNNs to our training set, as well as a separate\ntesting set with the same class balance of 25 progression and 25 regression\nimages.\nResults: DNE achieved monotonic convergence to 100% training set accuracy.\nDNE also converged monotonically to 100% testing set accuracy.\nConclusion: DNE can accurately classify brain-metastatic disease progression\nversus regression. Future work will extend the input from 2D image slices to\nfull 3D volumes, and include the category of no change. We believe that an\napproach such as our could ultimately provide a useful adjunct to RANO/RECIST\nassessment.",

Most current work uses a fixed single-scale window for modeling by\ndefault, ignoring the impact of window size on model performance. However, this\nmay limit the modeling potential of these window-based models for multi-scale\ninformation. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named Dynamic Window\nVision Transformer (DW-ViT). The dynamic window strategy proposed by DW-ViT\ngoes beyond the model that employs a fixed single window setting. To the best\nof our knowledge, we are the first to use dynamic multi-scale windows to\nexplore the upper limit of the effect of window settings on model performance.\nIn DW-ViT, multi-scale information is obtained by assigning windows of\ndifferent sizes to different head groups of window multi-head self-attention.\nThen, the information is dynamically fused by assigning different weights to\nthe multi-scale window branches. We conducted a detailed performance evaluation\non three datasets, ImageNet-1K, ADE20K, and COCO.

Existing local\nmeasurement-based methods use Thevenin equivalent parameter estimation that is\nsensitive to the noise in measurements. For solving this issue, we avoid the\nThevenin approach by projecting the power flow equations as circles to develop\nlocal static-voltage stability indicator (LS-VSI) that is robust to measurement\nnoises. The proposed method is an attractive option for practical\nimplementation because of its decentralized nature, robustness to noise, and\nrealistic modeling. Next, we utilize LS-VSI to propose a new local dynamic -\nVSI (LD-VSI) to identify the LTVI triggered by large disturbances and load tap\nchanger dynamics. LD-VSI can identify not only the onset of instability with an\nalarm but also the voltage collapse point (VCP). Extensive numerical validation\ncomparing LS-VSI with existing methods is presented on IEEE 30-bus and larger\ntest systems like 2000-bus Texas synthetic grid to validate the robustness,\naccuracy, and situational awareness feature.

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have demonstrated outstanding Compressed\nSensing (CS) performance compared to traditional, hand-crafted methods.\nHowever, they are broadly limited in terms of generalisability, inductive bias\nand difficulty to model long distance relationships. Transformer neural\nnetworks (TNN) overcome such issues by implementing an attention mechanism\ndesigned to capture dependencies between inputs. However, high-resolution tasks\ntypically require vision Transformers (ViT) to decompose an image into\npatch-based tokens, limiting inputs to inherently local contexts. We propose a\nnovel image decomposition that naturally embeds images into low-resolution\ninputs. These Kaleidoscope tokens (KD) provide a mechanism for global\nattention, at the same computational cost as a patch-based approach. To\nshowcase this development, we replace CNN components in a well-known CS-MRI\nneural network with TNN blocks and demonstrate the improvements afforded by KD.\nWe also propose an ensemble of image tokens, which enhance overall image\nquality and reduces model size.

However, the CheckList\ncreation process is manual which creates a bottleneck towards creation of\nmultilingual CheckLists catering 100s of languages. In this work, we explore\nmultiple approaches to generate and evaluate the quality of Multilingual\nCheckList. We device an algorithm -- Automated Multilingual Checklist\nGeneration (AMCG) for automatically transferring a CheckList from a source to a\ntarget language that relies on a reasonable machine translation system. We then\ncompare the CheckList generated by AMCG with CheckLists generated with\ndifferent levels of human intervention. Through in-depth crosslingual\nexperiments between English and Hindi, and broad multilingual experiments\nspanning 11 languages, we show that the automatic approach can provide accurate\nestimates of failure rates of a model across capabilities, as would a\nhuman-verified CheckList, and better than CheckLists generated by humans from\nscratch.",

    "abstract": "Structural re-parameterization (Rep) methods achieve noticeable improvements\non simple VGG-style networks. Despite the prevalence, current Rep methods\nsimply re-parameterize all operations into an augmented network, including\nthose that rarely contribute to the model's performance. As such, the price to\npay is an expensive computational overhead to manipulate these unnecessary\nbehaviors. To eliminate the above caveats, we aim to bootstrap the training\nwith minimal cost by devising a dynamic re-parameterization (DyRep) method,\nwhich encodes Rep technique into the training process that dynamically evolves\nthe network structures. Concretely, our proposal adaptively finds the\noperations which contribute most to the loss in the network, and applies Rep to\nenhance their representational capacity. Besides, to suppress the noisy and\nredundant operations introduced by Rep, we devise a de-parameterization\ntechnique for a more compact re-parameterization. With this regard, DyRep is\nmore efficient than Rep since it smoothly evolves the given network instead of\nconstructing an over-parameterized network. Experimental results demonstrate\nour effectiveness, e.g., DyRep improves the accuracy of ResNet-18 by $2.04\\%$\non ImageNet and reduces $22\\%$ runtime over the baseline.

However, the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms do not leverage the logic information behind the\nspecification and are not efficient enough for use in reality. In addition,\neven though reducing redundant BCs are explored in previous work, the computed\nBCs may be still not valuable to engineering for debugging. In this paper, we\nstart from scratch to establish the fundamental framework for the BC problem.\nBased on that, we first present a new approach SyntacBC to identify BCs with\nthe syntax information of goals. The experimental results show that this method\nis able to achieve a >1000X speed-up than the previous state-of-the-art\nmethodology. Inspired by the results, we found the defects of BCs solved by our\nmethod and also by the previous ones, i.e., most of BCs computed are difficult\nfor debugging. As a result, we leverage the semantics information of goals and\npropose an automata-based method for solving BCs, namely SemanticBC, which can\nnot only find the minimal scope of divergence, but also produce\neasy-to-understand BCs without losing performance.",

FER methods\nface the problems of relatively small datasets and noisy data that don't allow\nclassical networks to generalize well. To alleviate these issues, we guide the\nmodel to concentrate on specific facial areas like the eyes, the mouth or the\neyebrows, which we argue are decisive to recognise facial expressions. We\npropose the Privileged Attribution Loss (PAL), a method that directs the\nattention of the model towards the most salient facial regions by encouraging\nits attribution maps to correspond to a heatmap formed by facial landmarks.\nFurthermore, we introduce several channel strategies that allow the model to\nhave more degrees of freedom. The proposed method is independent of the\nbackbone architecture and doesn't need additional semantic information at test\ntime. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed PAL method\noutperforms current state-of-the-art methods on both RAF-DB and AffectNet.",

The best known upper bound on the number of communication\nbits is $\\Theta(\\frac{n^{3/2}}{\\sqrt{\\log{n}}})$ per process, while the best\nlower bound is $\\Omega(1)$. This is in contrast to randomized Consensus against\na (weak) oblivious adversary, for which time-almost-optimal algorithms\nguarantee amortized $O(1)$ communication bits per process \\cite{GK-SODA-10}.

However,\nthe quality of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) still raises concerns in the\npractical operational environment, which calls for systematic testing,\nespecially in safety-critical scenarios. Inspired by software testing, a number\nof structural coverage criteria are designed and proposed to measure the test\nadequacy of DNNs. However, due to the blackbox nature of DNN, the existing\nstructural coverage criteria are difficult to interpret, making it hard to\nunderstand the underlying principles of these criteria. The relationship\nbetween the structural coverage and the decision logic of DNNs is unknown.\nMoreover, recent studies have further revealed the non-existence of correlation\nbetween the structural coverage and DNN defect detection, which further posts\nconcerns on what a suitable DNN testing criterion should be.\nIn this paper, we propose the interpretable coverage criteria through\nconstructing the decision structure of a DNN. Mirroring the control flow graph\nof the traditional program, we first extract a decision graph from a DNN based\non its interpretation, where a path of the decision graph represents a decision\nlogic of the DNN. Based on the control flow and data flow of the decision\ngraph, we propose two variants of path coverage to measure the adequacy of the\ntest cases in exercising the decision logic. The higher the path coverage, the\nmore diverse decision logic the DNN is expected to be explored. Our large-scale\nevaluation results demonstrate that: the path in the decision graph is\neffective in characterizing the decision of the DNN, and the proposed coverage\ncriteria are also sensitive with errors including natural errors and\nadversarial examples, and strongly correlated with the output impartiality.",

In addition, we also\ningeniously utilize the principle of the discriminator and tailor a stitching\nloss to eliminate the gaps between different partitions of a generated shape\ncorresponding to different priors for boosting quality. Owing to the novel\ngenerating mechanism, WarpingGAN, a single lightweight network after one-time\ntraining, is capable of efficiently generating uniformly distributed 3D point\nclouds with various resolutions.

To tackle such issue, we propose a plug and play module, the\nRubik's Cube Operator (RCO), to adaptively permutate the data organization of\nthe industrial data based tensor to an optimal or suboptimal order of\nattributes before being processed by CNNs, which can be updated with subsequent\nCNNs together via the gradient-based optimizer.

A novel learning process is\nproposed to enable learning permutation matrices from data, where the\nGumbel-Softmax is employed to reparameterize elements of permutation matrices,\nand the soft regularization loss is proposed and added to the task-specific\nloss to ensure the feature diversity of the permuted data.

In this paper, we propose a novel Semantics-Centered\nNetwork (SC-Net) that consists of an instance-level contrastive semantic\nprediction module (ICSP) and a semantics-centered transformer module (SCT).\nEquipped with the two modules, the semantics-centered model can resist the\nlanguage biases and the accumulated errors from OCR. Extensive experiments on\nTextVQA and ST-VQA datasets show the effectiveness of our model. SC-Net\nsurpasses previous works with a noticeable margin and is more reasonable for\nthe TextVQA task.",

    "abstract": "Live migration of services is a prerequisite for various use cases that must\nbe fulfilled for the realization of Industry 4.0. In addition, many different\ntypes of services need to provide mobility and consequently need to be migrated\nlive. These can be offloaded algorithms from mobile devices, such as unmanned\nvehicles or robots, security services, communication services or classic\ncontrol tasks. In particular, the latter place very high demands on determinism\nand latency. Here, it is of utmost importance that the downtime of the service\nis as low as possible. Since existing live migration approaches try to optimize\nmultiple metrics such as downtime, migration time as well as energy\nconsumption, which are equally relevant in the IT domain, it is not possible to\nuse any of these approaches without adoptions.\nTherefore, a novel concept is proposed that builds on top of both existing\nmigration approaches as well as virtualization technologies and aims primarily\nat minimizing service downtime. Furthermore, the concept is evaluated using a\ntest environment. The results show that a sub-millisecond downtime can be\nachieved with the proposed concept. Moreover, the total migration time is in\nthe range of several hundred milliseconds for the highest performance setting\nand two seconds for a non-invasive approach.",

The\nanalysis module extracts distortionless speech features and distortion features\nfrom degraded speech, while the synthesis module synthesizes the restored\nspeech waveform, and the channel module adds distortions to the speech\nwaveform. Our model also enables audio effect transfer, in which only acoustic\ndistortions are extracted from degraded speech and added to arbitrary\nhigh-quality audio.

    "abstract": "Semantic matching models -- which assume that entities with similar semantics\nhave similar embeddings -- have shown great power in knowledge graph embeddings\n(KGE). Many existing semantic matching models use inner products in embedding\nspaces to measure the plausibility of triples and quadruples in static and\ntemporal knowledge graphs. However, vectors that have the same inner products\nwith another vector can still be orthogonal to each other, which implies that\nentities with similar semantics may have dissimilar embeddings. This property\nof inner products significantly limits the performance of semantic matching\nmodels. To address this challenge, we propose a novel regularizer -- namely,\nDUality-induced RegulArizer (DURA) -- which effectively encourages the entities\nwith similar semantics to have similar embeddings. The major novelty of DURA is\nbased on the observation that, for an existing semantic matching KGE model\n(primal), there is often another distance based KGE model (dual) closely\nassociated with it, which can be used as effective constraints for entity\nembeddings. Experiments demonstrate that DURA consistently and significantly\nimproves the performance of state-of-the-art semantic matching models on both\nstatic and temporal knowledge graph benchmarks.",

When the plant owner reduces the number of workers due to\noperation costs, it will be standard for a single worker to visit the site.\nTherefore, it is necessary to monitor the location of workers in real-time to\ndetect unexpected human accidents quickly. Conventional methods use radio\nwaves, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, but there is little demand for\ncommunication equipment in the incineration plant.

In this paper, we study the fundamental\nproblem of explainability of the DL solution for ER. Understanding the matching\npredictions of an ER solution is indeed crucial to assess the trustworthiness\nof the DL model and to discover its biases. We treat the DL model as a black\nbox classifier and - while previous approaches to provide explanations for DL\npredictions are agnostic to the classification task. we propose the CERTA\napproach that is aware of the semantics of the ER problem. Our approach\nproduces both saliency explanations, which associate each attribute with a\nsaliency score, and counterfactual explanations, which provide examples of\nvalues that can flip the prediction. CERTA builds on a probabilistic framework\nthat aims at computing the explanations evaluating the outcomes produced by\nusing perturbed copies of the input records.

Our novel bearing vectors representation of 3D points,\nsignificantly relieves the cross-domain challenge in geometric-based matching\nthat prevented prior work to tackle localization in a realistic environment.\nWith additional careful architecture design, GoMatch improves over prior\ngeometric-based matching work with a reduction of ($10.67m, 95.7^{\\circ}$) and\n($1.43m$, $34.7^{\\circ}$) in average median pose errors on Cambridge Landmarks\nand 7-Scenes, while requiring as little as $1.5/1.7\\%$ of storage capacity in\ncomparison to the best visual-based matching methods. This confirms its\npotential and feasibility for real-world localization and opens the door to\nfuture efforts in advancing city-scale visual localization methods that do not\nrequire storing visual descriptors.",

    "abstract": "In addition to signature-based and heuristics-based detection techniques,\nMachine learning (ML) is being widely used to generalize to new\nnever-before-seen malicious software (malware). However, it has been\ndemonstrated that ML models can be fooled by tricking the classifier into\nreturning the incorrect label. These studies usually rely on a prediction score\nthat is fragile to gradient-based attacks for instance. In the context of a\nmore realistic situation where an attacker has very little information about\nthe outputs of a malware detection engine, modest evasion rates are achieved.\nIn this paper, we propose a method using Reinforcement Learning with DQN and\nREINFORCE algorithms to challenge two state-of-the-art Machine Learning based\ndetection engines (MalConv \\& EMBER) and a commercial AV classified by Gartner\nas a leader in 2021. Our stateful method combines several actions modifying a\nWindows Portable Execution (PE) file without breaking its functionalities. Our\nmethod also identifies which actions perform better and compiles a detailed\nvulnerability report to help mitigate the evasion. We demonstrate that\nREINFORCE achieves very good evasion rates even on a commercial AV with low\nprovided information.",

    "abstract": "Although face swapping has attracted much attention in recent years, it\nremains a challenging problem. The existing methods leverage a large number of\ndata samples to explore the intrinsic properties of face swapping without\ntaking into account the semantic information of face images. Moreover, the\nrepresentation of the identity information tends to be fixed, leading to\nsuboptimal face swapping. In this paper, we present a simple yet efficient\nmethod named FaceSwapper, for one-shot face swapping based on Generative\nAdversarial Networks. Our method consists of a disentangled representation\nmodule and a semantic-guided fusion module. The disentangled representation\nmodule is composed of an attribute encoder and an identity encoder, which aims\nto achieve the disentanglement of the identity and the attribute information.\nThe identity encoder is more flexible and the attribute encoder contains more\ndetails of the attributes than its competitors. Benefiting from the\ndisentangled representation, FaceSwapper can swap face images progressively. In\naddition, semantic information is introduced into the semantic-guided fusion\nmodule to control the swapped area and model the pose and expression more\naccurately. The experimental results show that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets with fewer training samples.

    "abstract": "Recently, significant progress has been made on image denoising with strong\nsupervision from large-scale datasets. However, obtaining well-aligned\nnoisy-clean training image pairs for each specific scenario is complicated and\ncostly in practice. Consequently, applying a conventional supervised denoising\nnetwork on in-the-wild noisy inputs is not straightforward. Although several\nstudies have challenged this problem without strong supervision, they rely on\nless practical assumptions and cannot be applied to practical situations\ndirectly. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel and\npowerful self-supervised denoising method called CVF-SID based on a Cyclic\nmulti-Variate Function (CVF) module and a self-supervised image disentangling\n(SID) framework. The CVF module can output multiple decomposed variables of the\ninput and take a combination of the outputs back as an input in a cyclic\nmanner. Our CVF-SID can disentangle a clean image and noise maps from the input\nby leveraging various self-supervised loss terms. Unlike several methods that\nonly consider the signal-independent noise models, we also deal with\nsignal-dependent noise components for real-world applications. Furthermore, we\ndo not rely on any prior assumptions about the underlying noise distribution,\nmaking CVF-SID more generalizable toward realistic noise. Extensive experiments\non real-world datasets show that CVF-SID achieves state-of-the-art\nself-supervised image denoising performance and is comparable to other existing\napproaches.

Our method utilizes the multi-modal information, i.e., the visual\nand audio information, and employs a temporal encoder to model the temporal\ncontext in the videos. Besides, a smooth processor is applied to get more\nreasonable predictions, and a model ensemble strategy is used to improve the\nperformance of our proposed method. The experiment results show that our method\nachieves 65.55% ccc for valence and 70.88% ccc for arousal on the validation\nset of the Aff-Wild2 dataset, which prove the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethod.",

    "abstract": "Visual action planning particularly excels in applications where the state of\nthe system cannot be computed explicitly, such as manipulation of deformable\nobjects, as it enables planning directly from raw images. Even though the field\nhas been significantly accelerated by deep learning techniques, a crucial\nrequirement for their success is the availability of a large amount of data. In\nthis work, we propose the Augment-Connect-Explore (ACE) paradigm to enable\nvisual action planning in cases of data scarcity.\nWe build upon the Latent Space Roadmap (LSR) framework which performs\nplanning with a graph built in a low dimensional latent space. In particular,\nACE is used to i) Augment the available training dataset by autonomously\ncreating new pairs of datapoints, ii) create new unobserved Connections among\nrepresentations of states in the latent graph, and iii) Explore new regions of\nthe latent space in a targeted manner. We validate the proposed approach on\nboth simulated box stacking and real-world folding task showing the\napplicability for rigid and deformable object manipulation tasks, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The MAPE-K feedback loop has been established as the primary reference model\nfor self-adaptive and autonomous systems in domains such as autonomous driving,\nrobotics, and Cyber-Physical Systems. At the same time, the Human Machine\nTeaming (HMT) paradigm is designed to promote partnerships between humans and\nautonomous machines. It goes far beyond the degree of collaboration expected in\nhuman-on-the-loop and human-in-the-loop systems and emphasizes interactions,\npartnership, and teamwork between humans and machines. However, while MAPE-K\nenables fully autonomous behavior, it does not explicitly address the\ninteractions between humans and machines as intended by HMT. In this paper, we\npresent the MAPE-K-HMT framework which augments the traditional MAPE-K loop\nwith support for HMT. We identify critical human-machine teaming factors and\ndescribe the infrastructure needed across the various phases of the MAPE-K loop\nin order to effectively support HMT. This includes runtime models that are\nconstructed and populated dynamically across monitoring, analysis, planning,\nand execution phases to support human-machine partnerships. We illustrate\nMAPE-K-HMT using examples from an autonomous multi-UAV emergency response\nsystem, and present guidelines for integrating HMT into MAPE-K.",

    "abstract": "Temporal grounding in videos aims to localize one target video segment that\nsemantically corresponds to a given query sentence. Thanks to the semantic\ndiversity of natural language descriptions, temporal grounding allows activity\ngrounding beyond pre-defined classes and has received increasing attention in\nrecent years. The semantic diversity is rooted in the principle of\ncompositionality in linguistics, where novel semantics can be systematically\ndescribed by combining known words in novel ways (compositional\ngeneralization). However, current temporal grounding datasets do not\nspecifically test for the compositional generalizability. To systematically\nmeasure the compositional generalizability of temporal grounding models, we\nintroduce a new Compositional Temporal Grounding task and construct two new\ndataset splits, i.e., Charades-CG and ActivityNet-CG. Evaluating the\nstate-of-the-art methods on our new dataset splits, we empirically find that\nthey fail to generalize to queries with novel combinations of seen words. To\ntackle this challenge, we propose a variational cross-graph reasoning framework\nthat explicitly decomposes video and language into multiple structured\nhierarchies and learns fine-grained semantic correspondence among them.\nExperiments illustrate the superior compositional generalizability of our\napproach.

The study and pursuit of\nopen-ended evolution in artificial evolutionary systems exemplifies this goal.\nHowever, open-ended evolution research is hampered by two fundamental issues;\nthe struggle to replicate open-endedness in an artificial evolutionary system,\nand the fact that we only have one system (genetic evolution) from which to\ndraw inspiration. Here we argue that cultural evolution should be seen not only\nas another real-world example of an open-ended evolutionary system, but that\nthe unique qualities seen in cultural evolution provide us with a new\nperspective from which we can assess the fundamental properties of, and ask new\nquestions about, open-ended evolutionary systems, especially in regard to\nevolved open-endedness and transitions from bounded to unbounded evolution.\nHere we provide an overview of culture as an evolutionary system, highlight the\ninteresting case of human cultural evolution as an open-ended evolutionary\nsystem, and contextualise cultural evolution under the framework of (evolved)\nopen-ended evolution. We go on to provide a set of new questions that can be\nasked once we consider cultural evolution within the framework of open-ended\nevolution, and introduce new insights that we may be able to gain about evolved\nopen-endedness as a result of asking these questions.",

    "abstract": "Driving 3D characters to dance following a piece of music is highly\nchallenging due to the spatial constraints applied to poses by choreography\nnorms. In addition, the generated dance sequence also needs to maintain\ntemporal coherency with different music genres. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose a novel music-to-dance framework, Bailando, with two powerful\ncomponents: 1) a choreographic memory that learns to summarize meaningful\ndancing units from 3D pose sequence to a quantized codebook, 2) an actor-critic\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) that composes these units to a fluent\ndance coherent to the music. With the learned choreographic memory, dance\ngeneration is realized on the quantized units that meet high choreography\nstandards, such that the generated dancing sequences are confined within the\nspatial constraints. To achieve synchronized alignment between diverse motion\ntempos and music beats, we introduce an actor-critic-based reinforcement\nlearning scheme to the GPT with a newly-designed beat-align reward function.\nExtensive experiments on the standard benchmark demonstrate that our proposed\nframework achieves state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and\nquantitatively. Notably, the learned choreographic memory is shown to discover\nhuman-interpretable dancing-style poses in an unsupervised manner.",

    "abstract": "We consider linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) network games in which agents\nhave quadratic payoffs that depend on their individual and neighbors' actions,\nand an unknown payoff-relevant state. An information designer determines the\nfidelity of information revealed to the agents about the payoff state to\nmaximize the social welfare. Prior results show that full information\ndisclosure is optimal under certain assumptions on the payoffs, i.e., it is\nbeneficial for the average individual. In this paper, we provide conditions\nbased on the strength of the dependence of payoffs on neighbors' actions, i.e.,\ncompetition, under which a rational agent is expected to benefit, i.e., receive\nhigher payoffs, from full information disclosure. We find that all agents\nbenefit from information disclosure for the star network structure when the\ngame is symmetric and submodular or supermodular. We also identify that the\ncentral agent benefits more than a peripheral agent from full information\ndisclosure unless the competition is strong and the number of peripheral agents\nis small enough. Despite the fact that all agents expect to benefit from\ninformation disclosure ex-ante, a central agent can be worse-off from\ninformation disclosure in many realizations of the payoff state under strong\ncompetition, indicating that a risk-averse central agent can prefer\nuninformative signals ex-ante.",

First, we perform a detailed local Fourier\nanalysis (LFA) of a well-known collective Jacobi relaxation (CJR) scheme, where\nthe optimal smoothing factors are derived. This insightful analysis reveals\nthat the optimal relaxation parameters depend on mesh size and regularization\nparameters, which was not investigated in literature. Second, we propose and\nanalyze a new mass-based Braess-Sarazin relaxation (BSR) scheme, which is\nproven to provide smaller smoothing factors than the CJR scheme when $\\alpha\\ge\nch^4$ for a small constant $c$. Here $\\alpha$ is the regularization parameter\nand $h$ is the spatial mesh step size. These schemes are successfully extended\nto control-constrained cases through the semi-smooth Newton method. Coarsening\nby three or four with BSR is competitive with coarsening by two. Numerical\nexamples are presented to validate our theoretical outcomes.

    "abstract": "This paper explores the complexity associated with solving the inverse\nSturm-Liouville problem with Robin boundary conditions: given a sequence of\neigenvalues and a sequence of norming constants, how many limits does a\nuniversal algorithm require to return the potential and boundary conditions? It\nis shown that if all but finitely many of the eigenvalues and norming constants\ncoincide with those for the zero potential then the number of limits is zero,\ni.e. it is possible to retrieve the potential and boundary conditions precisely\nin finitely many steps. Otherwise, it is shown that this problem requires a\nsingle limit; moreover, if one has a priori control over how much the\neigenvalues and norming constants differ from those of the zero-potential\nproblem, and one knows that the average of the potential is zero, then the\ncomputation can be performed with complete error control.

    "abstract": "In this paper we will give a control theoretic perspective on the research\narea of behavior trees in robotics. The key idea underlying behavior trees is\nto make use of modularity, hierarchies and feedback, in order to handle the\ncomplexity of a versatile robot control system. Modularity is a well-known tool\nto handle software complexity by enabling development, debugging and extension\nof separate modules without having detailed knowledge of the entire system. A\nhierarchy of such modules is natural, since robot tasks can often be decomposed\ninto a hierarchy of sub-tasks. Finally, feedback control is a fundamental tool\nfor handling uncertainties and disturbances in any low level control system,\nbut in order to enable feedback control on the higher level, where one module\ndecides what submodule to execute, information regarding progress and\napplicability of each submodule needs to be shared in the module interfaces. We\nwill describe how these three concepts come to use in theoretical analysis,\npractical design, as well as extensions and combinations with other ideas from\ncontrol theory and robotics.",

    "abstract": "Novel prediction methods should always be compared to a baseline to know how\nwell they perform. Without this frame of reference, the performance score of a\nmodel is basically meaningless. What does it mean when a model achieves an\n$F_1$ of 0.8 on a test set? A proper baseline is needed to evaluate the\n`goodness' of a performance score. Comparing with the latest state-of-the-art\nmodel is usually insightful. However, being state-of-the-art can change rapidly\nwhen newer models are developed. Contrary to an advanced model, a simple dummy\nclassifier could be used. However, the latter could be beaten too easily,\nmaking the comparison less valuable. This paper presents a universal baseline\nmethod for all binary classification models, named the Dutch Draw (DD). This\napproach weighs simple classifiers and determines the best classifier to use as\na baseline. We theoretically derive the DD baseline for many commonly used\nevaluation measures and show that in most situations it reduces to (almost)\nalways predicting either zero or one. Summarizing, the DD baseline is: (1)\ngeneral, as it is applicable to all binary classification problems; (2) simple,\nas it is quickly determined without training or parameter-tuning; (3)\ninformative, as insightful conclusions can be drawn from the results. The DD\nbaseline serves two purposes. First, to enable comparisons across research\npapers by this robust and universal baseline. Secondly, to provide a sanity\ncheck during the development process of a prediction model. It is a major\nwarning sign when a model is outperformed by the DD baseline.",

This paper proposes\nColBERTer, a neural retrieval model using contextualized late interaction\n(ColBERT) with enhanced reduction. Along the effectiveness Pareto frontier,\nColBERTer's reductions dramatically lower ColBERT's storage requirements while\nsimultaneously improving the interpretability of its token-matching scores. To\nthis end, ColBERTer fuses single-vector retrieval, multi-vector refinement, and\noptional lexical matching components into one model. For its multi-vector\ncomponent, ColBERTer reduces the number of stored vectors per document by\nlearning unique whole-word representations for the terms in each document and\nlearning to identify and remove word representations that are not essential to\neffective scoring. We employ an explicit multi-task, multi-stage training to\nfacilitate using very small vector dimensions. Results on the MS MARCO and\nTREC-DL collection show that ColBERTer can reduce the storage footprint by up\nto 2.5x, while maintaining effectiveness. With just one dimension per token in\nits smallest setting, ColBERTer achieves index storage parity with the\nplaintext size, with very strong effectiveness results. Finally, we demonstrate\nColBERTer's robustness on seven high-quality out-of-domain collections,\nyielding statistically significant gains over traditional retrieval baselines.",

    "abstract": "Studying the inherent symmetry of data is of great importance in machine\nlearning. Point cloud, the most important data format for 3D environmental\nperception, is naturally endowed with strong radial symmetry. In this work, we\nexploit this radial symmetry via a divide-and-conquer strategy to boost 3D\nperception performance and ease optimization. We propose Azimuth Normalization\n(AziNorm), which normalizes the point clouds along the radial direction and\neliminates the variability brought by the difference of azimuth. AziNorm can be\nflexibly incorporated into most LiDAR-based perception methods. To validate its\neffectiveness and generalization ability, we apply AziNorm in both object\ndetection and semantic segmentation. For detection, we integrate AziNorm into\ntwo representative detection methods, the one-stage SECOND detector and the\nstate-of-the-art two-stage PV-RCNN detector. Experiments on Waymo Open Dataset\ndemonstrate that AziNorm improves SECOND and PV-RCNN by 7.03 mAPH and 3.01 mAPH\nrespectively. For segmentation, we integrate AziNorm into KPConv. On\nSemanticKitti dataset, AziNorm improves KPConv by 1.6/1.1 mIoU on val/test set.\nBesides, AziNorm remarkably improves data efficiency and accelerates\nconvergence, reducing the requirement of data amounts or training epochs by an\norder of magnitude. SECOND w/ AziNorm can significantly outperform fully\ntrained vanilla SECOND, even trained with only 10% data or 10% epochs. Code and\nmodels are available at https://github.com/hustvl/AziNorm.",

The topics\nselected for the workshops are aspects of 6G that we expect will have a\nsignificant impact on other industries and on society:\n- 6G as both a communication infrastructure and a sensing infrastructure\n- The extensive use of artificial intelligence in 6G\n- The security and resilience of 6G\nThis paper does not go into the technical details of how to develop and\nimplement 6G. Rather, it provides input from experts from both the wireless\nindustry as well as from other sectors about (mostly) non-technical topics that\nwill need to be addressed in parallel with the technical developments, such as\nnew use cases, regulation, communication with the public, and cross-industry\ncooperation.\nWe have identified six areas that will have a significant impact on the\ndevelopment and use of 6G, and that organizations must consider as they begin\ntheir plans and designs for 6G. Based on these six impact areas and on the\ndiscussion in the workshops, we compiled a list of the top 10 recommendations\nfor specific areas where organizations should place their focus when developing\ntheir strategic plan for 6G. In addition, for our readers who are involved in\n6G research, be it at a university, at a research institute or in industrial\nresearch, we also included a summary of the top 10 areas that require\nadditional research, again based on the input received in the workshops.\nA version of this paper with professional layout and graphics will be\navailable at www.thinknet-6g.de soon.",

    "abstract": "Semantic face editing has achieved substantial progress in recent years.\nKnown as a growingly popular method, latent space manipulation performs face\nediting by changing the latent code of an input face to liberate users from\npainting skills. However, previous latent space manipulation methods usually\nencode an entire face into a single low-dimensional embedding, which constrains\nthe reconstruction capacity and the control flexibility of facial components,\nsuch as eyes and nose. This paper proposes IA-FaceS as a bidirectional method\nfor disentangled face attribute manipulation as well as flexible, controllable\ncomponent editing without the need for segmentation masks or sketches in the\noriginal image. To strike a balance between the reconstruction capacity and the\ncontrol flexibility, the encoder is designed as a multi-head structure to yield\nembeddings for reconstruction and control, respectively: a high-dimensional\ntensor with spatial properties for consistent reconstruction and four\nlow-dimensional facial component embeddings for semantic face editing.\nManipulating the separate component embeddings can help achieve disentangled\nattribute manipulation and flexible control of facial components. To further\ndisentangle the highly-correlated components, a component adaptive modulation\n(CAM) module is proposed for the decoder. The semantic single-eye editing is\ndeveloped for the first time without any input visual guidance, such as\nsegmentation masks or sketches. According to the experimental results, IA-FaceS\nestablishes a good balance between maintaining image details and performing\nflexible face manipulation. Both quantitative and qualitative results indicate\nthat the proposed method outperforms the other techniques in reconstruction,\nface attribute manipulation, and component transfer.",

    "abstract": "Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) struggles with catastrophic forgetting when\nlearning new knowledge, and Data-Free CIL (DFCIL) is even more challenging\nwithout access to the training data of previous classes. Though recent DFCIL\nworks introduce techniques such as model inversion to synthesize data for\nprevious classes, they fail to overcome forgetting due to the severe domain gap\nbetween the synthetic and real data. To address this issue, this paper proposes\nrelation-guided representation learning (RRL) for DFCIL, dubbed R-DFCIL. In\nRRL, we introduce relational knowledge distillation to flexibly transfer the\nstructural relation of new data from the old model to the current model. Our\nRRL-boosted DFCIL can guide the current model to learn representations of new\nclasses better compatible with representations of previous classes, which\ngreatly reduces forgetting while improving plasticity. To avoid the mutual\ninterference between representation and classifier learning, we employ local\nrather than global classification loss during RRL. After RRL, the\nclassification head is fine-tuned with global class-balanced classification\nloss to address the data imbalance issue as well as learn the decision boundary\nbetween new and previous classes. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100,\nTiny-ImageNet200, and ImageNet100 demonstrate that our R-DFCIL significantly\nsurpasses previous approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art performance\nfor DFCIL.",

    "abstract": "A major prerequisite for the application of machine learning models in\nclinical decision making is trust and interpretability. Current explainability\nstudies in the neuroimaging community have mostly focused on explaining\nindividual decisions of trained models, e.g. obtained by a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN). Using attribution methods such as layer-wise relevance\npropagation or SHAP heatmaps can be created that highlight which regions of an\ninput are more relevant for the decision than others. While this allows the\ndetection of potential data set biases and can be used as a guide for a human\nexpert, it does not allow an understanding of the underlying principles the\nmodel has learned. In this study, we instead show, to the best of our\nknowledge, for the first time results using feature visualization of\nneuroimaging CNNs. Particularly, we have trained CNNs for different tasks\nincluding sex classification and artificial lesion classification based on\nstructural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. We have then iteratively\ngenerated images that maximally activate specific neurons, in order to\nvisualize the patterns they respond to. To improve the visualizations we\ncompared several regularization strategies. The resulting images reveal the\nlearned concepts of the artificial lesions, including their shapes, but remain\nhard to interpret for abstract features in the sex classification task.",

Traditionally,\nin complex thermodynamic systems, it is often infeasible to estimate the\nthermophysical parameters of spatiotemporally varying processes, forcing the\nadoption of model-free control architectures. This comes at the cost of losing\nany robustness guarantees, and implies a need for extensive real-life testing.\nIn recent years, however, infrared cameras and other thermographic equipment\nhave become readily applicable to these processes, allowing for a real-time,\nnon-invasive means of sensing the thermal state of a process.

First, the model is pre-trained over large volumes of\ntext to minimize a generic objective function, such as the Masked Language\nModel (MLM). Second, the model is fine-tuned in specific downstream tasks.\nPre-training requires large volumes of data and high computational resources,\nwhile introducing many still unresolved design choices. For instance, selecting\nhyperparameters for language model pre-training is often carried out based on\nheuristics or grid-based searches. In this work, we propose a multi-armed\nbandit-based online optimization framework for the sequential selection of\npre-training hyperparameters to optimize language model performance. We pose\nthe pre-training procedure as a sequential decision-making task, where at each\npre-training step, an agent must determine what hyperparameters to use towards\noptimizing the pre-training objective. We propose a Thompson sampling bandit\nalgorithm, based on a surrogate Gaussian process reward model of the MLM\npre-training objective, for its sequential minimization. We empirically show\nhow the proposed Gaussian process based Thompson sampling pre-trains robust and\nwell-performing language models. Namely, by sequentially selecting masking\nhyperparameters of the TLM, we achieve satisfactory performance in less epochs,\nnot only in terms of the pre-training MLM objective, but in diverse downstream\nfine-tuning tasks. The proposed bandit-based technique provides an automated\nhyperparameter selection method for pre-training TLMs of interest to\npractitioners.

    "abstract": "Generating speech-consistent body and gesture movements is a long-standing\nproblem in virtual avatar creation. Previous studies often synthesize pose\nmovement in a holistic manner, where poses of all joints are generated\nsimultaneously. Such a straightforward pipeline fails to generate fine-grained\nco-speech gestures. One observation is that the hierarchical semantics in\nspeech and the hierarchical structures of human gestures can be naturally\ndescribed into multiple granularities and associated together. To fully utilize\nthe rich connections between speech audio and human gestures, we propose a\nnovel framework named Hierarchical Audio-to-Gesture (HA2G) for co-speech\ngesture generation. In HA2G, a Hierarchical Audio Learner extracts audio\nrepresentations across semantic granularities. A Hierarchical Pose Inferer\nsubsequently renders the entire human pose gradually in a hierarchical manner.\nTo enhance the quality of synthesized gestures, we develop a contrastive\nlearning strategy based on audio-text alignment for better audio\nrepresentations. Extensive experiments and human evaluation demonstrate that\nthe proposed method renders realistic co-speech gestures and outperforms\nprevious methods in a clear margin.

In the study of complex\nsystems, random fields are mathematical structures that models the interaction\nbetween these variables by means of an inverse temperature parameter,\nresponsible for controlling the spatial dependence structure along the field.\nIn this paper, we derive closed-form expressions for the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence between two pairwise isotropic Gaussian-Markov random fields in both\nunivariate and multivariate cases. The proposed equation allows the development\nof novel similarity measures in image processing and machine learning\napplications, such as image denoising and unsupervised metric learning.",

    "title": "Self-supervised Video-centralised Transformer for Video Face Clustering",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for face clustering in videos using a\nvideo-centralised transformer. Previous works often employed contrastive\nlearning to learn frame-level representation and used average pooling to\naggregate the features along the temporal dimension. This approach may not\nfully capture the complicated video dynamics. In addition, despite the recent\nprogress in video-based contrastive learning, few have attempted to learn a\nself-supervised clustering-friendly face representation that benefits the video\nface clustering task. To overcome these limitations, our method employs a\ntransformer to directly learn video-level representations that can better\nreflect the temporally-varying property of faces in videos, while we also\npropose a video-centralised self-supervised framework to train the transformer\nmodel. We also investigate face clustering in egocentric videos, a\nfast-emerging field that has not been studied yet in works related to face\nclustering. To this end, we present and release the first large-scale\negocentric video face clustering dataset named EasyCom-Clustering. We evaluate\nour proposed method on both the widely used Big Bang Theory (BBT) dataset and\nthe new EasyCom-Clustering dataset. Results show the performance of our\nvideo-centralised transformer has surpassed all previous state-of-the-art\nmethods on both benchmarks, exhibiting a self-attentive understanding of face\nvideos.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the continual learning of Vision Transformers\n(ViT) for the challenging exemplar-free scenario, with special focus on how to\nefficiently distill the knowledge of its crucial self-attention mechanism\n(SAM). Our work takes an initial step towards a surgical investigation of SAM\nfor designing coherent continual learning methods in ViTs. We first carry out\nan evaluation of established continual learning regularization techniques. We\nthen examine the effect of regularization when applied to two key enablers of\nSAM: (a) the contextualized embedding layers, for their ability to capture\nwell-scaled representations with respect to the values, and (b) the prescaled\nattention maps, for carrying value-independent global contextual information.\nWe depict the perks of each distilling strategy on two image recognition\nbenchmarks (CIFAR100 and ImageNet-32) -- while (a) leads to a better overall\naccuracy, (b) helps enhance the rigidity by maintaining competitive\nperformances. Furthermore, we identify the limitation imposed by the symmetric\nnature of regularization losses. To alleviate this, we propose an asymmetric\nvariant and apply it to the pooled output distillation (POD) loss adapted for\nViTs. Our experiments confirm that introducing asymmetry to POD boosts its\nplasticity while retaining stability across (a) and (b). Moreover, we\nacknowledge low forgetting measures for all the compared methods, indicating\nthat ViTs might be naturally inclined continual learner",

The significant performance boost brought by the\nmulti-agent system can be degraded dramatically when the perception models are\nnoticeably different. In this work, we propose a model-agnostic multi-agent\nframework to reduce the negative effect caused by model discrepancies and\nmaintain confidentiality. Specifically, we consider the perception\nheterogeneity between agents by integrating a novel uncertainty calibrator\nwhich can eliminate the bias among agents' predicted confidence scores. Each\nagent performs such calibration independently on a standard public database,\nand therefore the intellectual property can be protected. To further refine the\ndetection accuracy, we also propose a new algorithm called\nPromotion-Suppression Aggregation (PSA) that considers not only the confidence\nscore of proposals but also the spatial agreement of their neighbors. Our\nexperiments emphasize the necessity of model calibration across different\nagents, and the results show that our proposed approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art baseline methods for 3D object detection on the open OPV2V\ndataset.",

Depending on how many attributes are\ncombined, concepts are more general (\"circle\") or more specific (\"red dotted\ncircle\"). Based on the context, the agents have to communicate at different\nlevels of this hierarchy. Our results show, that the agents learn to play the\ngame successfully and can even generalize to novel concepts. To achieve\nabstraction, they use implicit (omitting irrelevant information) and explicit\n(indicating that attributes are irrelevant) strategies. In addition, the\ncompositional structure underlying the concept hierarchy is reflected in the\nemergent protocols, indicating that the need to develop hierarchical reference\nsystems supports the emergence of compositionality.",

    "title": "A Perturbation Constrained Adversarial Attack for Evaluating the  Robustness of Optical Flow",
    "abstract": "Recent optical flow methods are almost exclusively judged in terms of\naccuracy, while analyzing their robustness is often neglected. Although\nadversarial attacks offer a useful tool to perform such an analysis, current\nattacks on optical flow methods rather focus on real-world attacking scenarios\nthan on a worst case robustness assessment. Hence, in this work, we propose a\nnovel adversarial attack - the Perturbation Constrained Flow Attack (PCFA) -\nthat emphasizes destructivity over applicability as a real-world attack. More\nprecisely, PCFA is a global attack that optimizes adversarial perturbations to\nshift the predicted flow towards a specified target flow, while keeping the L2\nnorm of the perturbation below a chosen bound. Our experiments not only\ndemonstrate PCFA's applicability in white- and black-box settings, but also\nshow that it finds stronger adversarial samples for optical flow than previous\nattacking frameworks. Moreover, based on these strong samples, we provide the\nfirst common ranking of optical flow methods in the literature considering both\nprediction quality and adversarial robustness, indicating that high quality\nmethods are not necessarily robust. Our source code will be publicly available.",

In this paper, we propose a correspondences-free\nunsupervised point cloud registration (UPCR) method from the representation\nseparation perspective. First, we model the input point cloud as a combination\nof pose-invariant representation and pose-related representation. Second, the\npose-related representation is used to learn the relative pose wrt a \"latent\ncanonical shape\" for the source and target point clouds respectively. Third,\nthe rigid transformation is obtained from the above two learned relative poses.\nOur method not only filters out the disturbance in pose-invariant\nrepresentation but also is robust to partial-to-partial point clouds or noise.\nExperiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our unsupervised method\nachieves comparable if not better performance than state-of-the-art supervised\nregistration methods.",

    "abstract": "3D point cloud registration is fragile to outliers, which are labeled as the\npoints without corresponding points. To handle this problem, a widely adopted\nstrategy is to estimate the relative pose based only on some accurate\ncorrespondences, which is achieved by building correspondences on the\nidentified inliers or by selecting reliable ones. However, these approaches are\nusually complicated and time-consuming. By contrast, the virtual point-based\nmethods learn the virtual corresponding points (VCPs) for all source points\nuniformly without distinguishing the outliers and the inliers. Although this\nstrategy is time-efficient, the learned VCPs usually exhibit serious collapse\ndegeneration due to insufficient supervision and the inherent distribution\nlimitation. In this paper, we propose to exploit the best of both worlds and\npresent a novel robust 3D point cloud registration framework. We follow the\nidea of the virtual point-based methods but learn a new type of virtual points\ncalled rectified virtual corresponding points (RCPs), which are defined as the\npoint set with the same shape as the source and with the same pose as the\ntarget. Hence, a pair of consistent point clouds, i.e. source and RCPs, is\nformed by rectifying VCPs to RCPs (VRNet), through which reliable\ncorrespondences between source and RCPs can be accurately obtained. Since the\nrelative pose between source and RCPs is the same as the relative pose between\nsource and target, the input point clouds can be registered naturally.\nSpecifically, we first construct the initial VCPs by using an estimated soft\nmatching matrix to perform a weighted average on the target points. Then, we\ndesign a correction-walk module to learn an offset to rectify VCPs to RCPs,\nwhich effectively breaks the distribution limitation of VCPs.

    "abstract": "Optimizing behaviors for dexterous manipulation has been a longstanding\nchallenge in robotics, with a variety of methods from model-based control to\nmodel-free reinforcement learning having been previously explored in\nliterature. Perhaps one of the most powerful techniques to learn complex\nmanipulation strategies is imitation learning. However, collecting and learning\nfrom demonstrations in dexterous manipulation is quite challenging. The\ncomplex, high-dimensional action-space involved with multi-finger control often\nleads to poor sample efficiency of learning-based methods. In this work, we\npropose 'Dexterous Imitation Made Easy' (DIME) a new imitation learning\nframework for dexterous manipulation. DIME only requires a single RGB camera to\nobserve a human operator and teleoperate our robotic hand. Once demonstrations\nare collected, DIME employs standard imitation learning methods to train\ndexterous manipulation policies. On both simulation and real robot benchmarks\nwe demonstrate that DIME can be used to solve complex, in-hand manipulation\ntasks such as 'flipping', 'spinning', and 'rotating' objects with the Allegro\nhand. Our framework along with pre-collected demonstrations is publicly\navailable at https://nyu-robot-learning.github.io/dime.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art transformer-based video instance segmentation (VIS)\napproaches typically utilize either single-scale spatio-temporal features or\nper-frame multi-scale features during the attention computations. We argue that\nsuch an attention computation ignores the multi-scale spatio-temporal feature\nrelationships that are crucial to tackle target appearance deformations in\nvideos. To address this issue, we propose a transformer-based VIS framework,\nnamed MS-STS VIS, that comprises a novel multi-scale spatio-temporal split\n(MS-STS) attention module in the encoder. The proposed MS-STS module\neffectively captures spatio-temporal feature relationships at multiple scales\nacross frames in a video. We further introduce an attention block in the\ndecoder to enhance the temporal consistency of the detected instances in\ndifferent frames of a video. Moreover, an auxiliary discriminator is introduced\nduring training to ensure better foreground-background separability within the\nmulti-scale spatio-temporal feature space. We conduct extensive experiments on\ntwo benchmarks: Youtube-VIS (2019 and 2021). Our MS-STS VIS achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on both benchmarks. When using the ResNet50\nbackbone, our MS-STS achieves a mask AP of 50.1 %, outperforming the best\nreported results in literature by 2.7 % and by 4.8 % at higher overlap\nthreshold of AP_75, while being comparable in model size and speed on\nYoutube-VIS 2019 val. set. When using the Swin Transformer backbone, MS-STS VIS\nachieves mask AP of 61.0 % on Youtube-VIS 2019 val. set. Our code and models\nare available at https://github.com/OmkarThawakar/MSSTS-VIS.",

    "abstract": "Locating 3D objects from a single RGB image via Perspective-n-Points (PnP) is\na long-standing problem in computer vision. Driven by end-to-end deep learning,\nrecent studies suggest interpreting PnP as a differentiable layer, so that\n2D-3D point correspondences can be partly learned by backpropagating the\ngradient w.r.t. object pose. Yet, learning the entire set of unrestricted 2D-3D\npoints from scratch fails to converge with existing approaches, since the\ndeterministic pose is inherently non-differentiable. In this paper, we propose\nthe EPro-PnP, a probabilistic PnP layer for general end-to-end pose estimation,\nwhich outputs a distribution of pose on the SE(3) manifold, essentially\nbringing categorical Softmax to the continuous domain. The 2D-3D coordinates\nand corresponding weights are treated as intermediate variables learned by\nminimizing the KL divergence between the predicted and target pose\ndistribution. The underlying principle unifies the existing approaches and\nresembles the attention mechanism. EPro-PnP significantly outperforms\ncompetitive baselines, closing the gap between PnP-based method and the\ntask-specific leaders on the LineMOD 6DoF pose estimation and nuScenes 3D\nobject detection benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Patient scans from MRI often suffer from noise, which hampers the diagnostic\ncapability of such images. As a method to mitigate such artifact, denoising is\nlargely studied both within the medical imaging community and beyond the\ncommunity as a general subject. However, recent deep neural network-based\napproaches mostly rely on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimates,\nwhich tend to produce a blurred output. Moreover, such models suffer when\ndeployed in real-world sitautions: out-of-distribution data, and complex noise\ndistributions that deviate from the usual parametric noise models. In this\nwork, we propose a new denoising method based on score-based reverse diffusion\nsampling, which overcomes all the aforementioned drawbacks. Our network,\ntrained only with coronal knee scans, excels even on out-of-distribution in\nvivo liver MRI data, contaminated with complex mixture of noise. Even more, we\npropose a method to enhance the resolution of the denoised image with the same\nnetwork. With extensive experiments, we show that our method establishes\nstate-of-the-art performance, while having desirable properties which prior\nMMSE denoisers did not have: flexibly choosing the extent of denoising, and\nquantifying uncertainty.",

Due to this unsupervised learning strategy, our trained\nregularizer truly represents higher-level domain statistics, which we\nempirically demonstrate by synthesizing CT images.

For this task, algorithms\nthat run on quantum computers are known to be exponentially faster than\nclassical algorithms; in fact, this application motivated Feynman to propose\nthe construction of quantum computers. Nonetheless, there are challenges in\nreaching this performance potential.\nPrior work has focused on compiling circuits (quantum programs) for HS with\nthe goal of maximizing either accuracy or gate cancellation.

At a high\nlevel, we use classical optimizations such as graph coloring and travelling\nsalesperson to order the execution of quantum programs. Specifically, we group\ntogether mutually commuting terms in the Hamiltonian (a matrix characterizing\nthe quantum mechanical system) to improve the accuracy of the simulation. We\nthen rearrange the terms within each group to maximize gate cancellation in the\nfinal quantum circuit. These optimizations work together to improve HS\nperformance and result in an average 40% reduction in circuit depth.

This paper proposes novel channel prediction algorithms that address\nthis goal by integrating transfer and meta-learning with a reduced-rank\nparametrization of the channel. The proposed methods optimize linear predictors\nby utilizing data from previous frames, which are generally characterized by\ndistinct propagation characteristics, in order to enable fast training on the\ntime slots of the current frame. The proposed predictors rely on a novel\nlong-short-term decomposition (LSTD) of the linear prediction model that\nleverages the disaggregation of the channel into long-term space-time\nsignatures and fading amplitudes.

The efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis has become highly significant.\nAs deep learning and convolutional neural network (CNN) has been widely\nutilized and been verified in analyzing medical images, it has become a\npowerful tool for computer-assisted diagnosis. However, there are two most\nsignificant challenges in medical image classification with the help of deep\nlearning and neural networks, one of them is the difficulty of acquiring enough\nsamples, which may lead to model overfitting. Privacy concerns mainly bring the\nother challenge since medical-related records are often deemed patients'\nprivate information and protected by laws such as GDPR and HIPPA. Federated\nlearning can ensure the model training is decentralized on different devices\nand no data is shared among them, which guarantees privacy. However, with data\nlocated on different devices, the accessible data of each device could be\nlimited. Since transfer learning has been verified in dealing with limited data\nwith good performance, therefore, in this paper, We made a trial to implement\nfederated learning and transfer learning techniques using CNNs to classify\nCOVID-19 using lung CT scans. We also explored the impact of dataset\ndistribution at the client-side in federated learning and the number of\ntraining epochs a model is trained.

    "abstract": "Evaluation relationships are pivotal for maintaining a cooperative society. A\nformation of the evaluation relationships has been discussed in terms of\nindirect reciprocity, by modeling dynamics of good or bad reputations among\nindividuals. Recently, a situation that individuals independently evaluate\nothers with errors (i.e., noisy and private reputation) is considered, where\nthe reputation structure (from what proportion of individuals in the population\neach receives good reputations, defined as goodness here) becomes complex, and\nthus has been studied mainly with numerical simulations. The present study\ngives a theoretical analysis of such complex reputation structure. We formulate\na stochastic transition of goodness of individuals. By considering a large\npopulation, we derive dynamics of the frequency distribution of goodnesses. An\nequilibrium state of the dynamics is approximated by a summation of Gaussian\nfunctions. We demonstrate that the theoretical solution well fits the numerical\ncalculation. From the theoretical solution, we obtain a new interpretation of\nthe complex reputation structure. This study provides a novel mathematical\nbasis for cutting-edge studies on indirect reciprocity.",

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the two-timescale resource allocation problem in IIoT networks with\nhybrid energy supply, where temporal variations of energy harvesting (EH),\nelectricity price, channel state, and data arrival exhibit different\ngranularity. The formulated problem consists of energy management at a large\ntimescale, as well as rate control, channel selection, and power allocation at\na small timescale. To address this challenge, we develop an online solution to\nguarantee bounded performance deviation with only causal information.\nSpecifically, Lyapunov optimization is leveraged to transform the long-term\nstochastic optimization problem into a series of short-term deterministic\noptimization problems. Then, a low-complexity rate control algorithm is\ndeveloped based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which\naccelerates the convergence speed via the decomposition-coordination approach.\nNext, the joint channel selection and power allocation problem is transformed\ninto a one-to-many matching problem, and solved by the proposed price-based\nmatching with quota restriction. Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified\nthrough simulations under various system configurations.",

    "abstract": "Human-machine interaction is gaining traction in rehabilitation tasks, such\nas controlling prosthetic hands or robotic arms. Gesture recognition exploiting\nsurface electromyographic (sEMG) signals is one of the most promising\napproaches, given that sEMG signal acquisition is non-invasive and is directly\nrelated to muscle contraction. However, the analysis of these signals still\npresents many challenges since similar gestures result in similar muscle\ncontractions. Thus the resulting signal shapes are almost identical, leading to\nlow classification accuracy. To tackle this challenge, complex neural networks\nare employed, which require large memory footprints, consume relatively high\nenergy and limit the maximum battery life of devices used for classification.\nThis work addresses this problem with the introduction of the Bioformers. This\nnew family of ultra-small attention-based architectures approaches\nstate-of-the-art performance while reducing the number of parameters and\noperations of 4.9X. Additionally, by introducing a new inter-subjects\npre-training, we improve the accuracy of our best Bioformer by 3.39%, matching\nstate-of-the-art accuracy without any additional inference cost. Deploying our\nbest performing Bioformer on a Parallel, Ultra-Low Power (PULP) microcontroller\nunit (MCU), the GreenWaves GAP8, we achieve an inference latency and energy of\n2.72 ms and 0.14 mJ, respectively, 8.0X lower than the previous\nstate-of-the-art neural network, while occupying just 94.2 kB of memory.",

    "title": "Addressing Missing Sources with Adversarial Support-Matching",
    "abstract": "When trained on diverse labeled data, machine learning models have proven\nthemselves to be a powerful tool in all facets of society. However, due to\nbudget limitations, deliberate or non-deliberate censorship, and other problems\nduring data collection and curation, the labeled training set might exhibit a\nsystematic shortage of data for certain groups. We investigate a scenario in\nwhich the absence of certain data is linked to the second level of a two-level\nhierarchy in the data. Inspired by the idea of protected groups from\nalgorithmic fairness, we refer to the partitions carved by this second level as\n\"subgroups\"; we refer to combinations of subgroups and classes, or leaves of\nthe hierarchy, as \"sources\". To characterize the problem, we introduce the\nconcept of classes with incomplete subgroup support. The representational bias\nin the training set can give rise to spurious correlations between the classes\nand the subgroups which render standard classification models ungeneralizable\nto unseen sources. To overcome this bias, we make use of an additional, diverse\nbut unlabeled dataset, called the \"deployment set\", to learn a representation\nthat is invariant to subgroup. This is done by adversarially matching the\nsupport of the training and deployment sets in representation space. In order\nto learn the desired invariance, it is paramount that the sets of samples\nobserved by the discriminator are balanced by class; this is easily achieved\nfor the training set, but requires using semi-supervised clustering for the\ndeployment set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with experiments\non several datasets and variants of the problem.",

    "title": "Improving Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling method to measure inter  content scale",
    "abstract": "The goal of most subjective studies is to place a set of stimuli on a\nperceptual scale. This is mostly done directly by rating, e.g. using single or\ndouble stimulus methodologies, or indirectly by ranking or pairwise comparison.\nAll these methods estimate the perceptual magnitudes of the stimuli on a scale.\nHowever, procedures such as Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling (MLDS) have\nshown that considering perceptual distances can bring benefits in terms of\ndiscriminatory power, observers' cognitive load, and the number of trials\nrequired. One of the disadvantages of the MLDS method is that the perceptual\nscales obtained for stimuli created from different source content are generally\nnot comparable. In this paper, we propose an extension of the MLDS method that\nensures inter-content comparability of the results and shows its usefulness\nespecially in the presence of observer errors.",

In particular, we consider group-structured and bounded\n$f$-divergence uncertainty sets. Our approach relies on an accelerated method\nthat queries a ball optimization oracle, i.e., a subroutine that minimizes the\nobjective within a small ball around the query point. Our main contribution is\nefficient implementations of this oracle for DRO objectives. For DRO with $N$\nnon-smooth loss functions, the resulting algorithms find an $\\epsilon$-accurate\nsolution with $\\widetilde{O}\\left(N\\epsilon^{-2/3} + \\epsilon^{-2}\\right)$\nfirst-order oracle queries to individual loss functions.

We show that there is a function\n$f(k, d) = O(k^{10} + 2^{d^5})$ so that if a graph has treewidth at least $f(k,\nd)$ and maximum degree at most $d$, then it contains a $k \\times k$-grid as an\ninduced minor. This proves the conjecture of Aboulker, Adler, Kim, Sintiari,\nand Trotignon [Eur. J. Comb., 98, 2021] that any graph with large treewidth and\nbounded maximum degree contains a large wall or the line graph of a large wall\nas an induced subgraph. It also implies that for any fixed planar graph $H$,\nthere is a subexponential time algorithm for maximum weight independent set on\n$H$-induced-minor-free graphs.",
