    "abstract": "Accuracies of deep learning (DL) classifiers are often unstable in that they\nmay change significantly when retested on adversarial images, imperfect images,\nor perturbed images. This paper adds to the fundamental body of work on\nbenchmarking the robustness of DL classifiers on defective images. To measure\nrobust DL classifiers, previous research reported on single-factor corruption.\nWe created comprehensive 69 benchmarking image sets, including a clean set,\nsets with single factor perturbations, and sets with two-factor perturbation\nconditions. The state-of-the-art two-factor perturbation includes (a) two\ndigital perturbations (salt & pepper noise and Gaussian noise) applied in both\nsequences, and (b) one digital perturbation (salt & pepper noise) and a\ngeometric perturbation (rotation) applied in both sequences. Previous research\nevaluating DL classifiers has often used top-1/top-5 accuracy. We innovate a\nnew two-dimensional, statistical matrix to evaluating robustness of DL\nclassifiers. Also, we introduce a new visualization tool, including minimum\naccuracy, maximum accuracy, mean accuracies, and coefficient of variation (CV),\nfor benchmarking robustness of DL classifiers. Comparing with single factor\ncorruption, we first report that using two-factor perturbed images improves\nboth robustness and accuracy of DL classifiers.

    "abstract": "Health misinformation is believed to have contributed to vaccine hesitancy\nduring the Covid-19 pandemic, highlighting concerns about the role of social\nmedia in polarization and social stability. While previous research has\nidentified a link between political partisanship and misinformation sharing\nonline, the interaction between partisanship and how much misinformation people\nsee within their social networks has not been well studied. As a result, we do\nnot know whether partisanship drives exposure to misinformation or people\nselectively share misinformation despite being exposed to factual content. We\nstudy Twitter discussions about the Covid-19 pandemic, classifying users\nideologically along political and factual dimensions. We find partisan\nasymmetries in both sharing behaviors and exposure, with conservatives more\nlikely to see and share misinformation and moderate liberals seeing the most\nfactual content. We identify multi-dimensional echo chambers that expose users\nto ideologically congruent content; however, the interaction between political\nand factual dimensions creates conditions for the highly polarized users --\nhardline conservatives and liberals -- to amplify misinformation. Despite this,\nmisinformation receives less attention than factual content and political\nmoderates, who represent the bulk of users in our sample, help filter out\nmisinformation, reducing the amount of low factuality content in the\ninformation ecosystem. Identifying the extent of polarization and how political\nideology can exacerbate misinformation can potentially help public health\nexperts and policy makers improve their messaging to promote consensus.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning methods have been shown to give accurate predictions in high\ndimensions provided that sufficient training data are available. Yet, many\ninteresting questions in science and engineering involve situations where\ninitially no data are available and the principal aim is to gather insights\nfrom a known model. Here we consider this problem in the context of systems\nwhose evolution can be described by partial differential equations (PDEs). We\nuse deep learning to solve these equations by generating data on-the-fly when\nand where they are needed, without prior information about the solution. The\nproposed Neural Galerkin schemes derive nonlinear dynamical equations for the\nnetwork weights by minimization of the residual of the time derivative of the\nsolution, and solve these equations using standard integrators for initial\nvalue problems. The sequential learning of the weights over time allows for\nadaptive collection of new input data for residual estimation. This step uses\nimportance sampling informed by the current state of the solution, in contrast\nwith other machine learning methods for PDEs that optimize the network\nparameters globally in time. This active form of data acquisition is essential\nto enable the approximation power of the neural networks and to break the curse\nof dimensionality faced by non-adaptative learning strategies. The\napplicability of the method is illustrated on several numerical examples\ninvolving high-dimensional PDEs, including advection equations with many\nvariables, as well as Fokker-Planck equations for systems with several\ninteracting particles.",

    "abstract": "Power electronic devices such as HVDC and FACTS can be used to improve the\ndamping of poorly damped inter-area modes in large power systems. This involves\nthe use of wide-area feedback signals, which are transmitted via communication\nnetworks. The performance of the closed-loop system is strongly influenced by\nthe delay associated with wide-area signals. The random nature of this delay\nintroduces a switched linear system model. The stability assessment of such a\nsystem requires linear matrix inequality based approaches. This makes the\nstability analysis more complicated as the system size increases. To address\nthis challenge, this paper proposes a delay-processing strategy that simplifies\nthe modelling and analysis in discrete-domain. In contrast to the existing\nstability assessment techniques, the proposed approach is advantageous because\nthe stability, as well as damping performance, can be accurately predicted by a\nsimplified analysis. The proposed methodology is verified with a case study on\nthe 2-area 4-machine power system with a series compensated tie-line. The\nresults are found to be in accordance with the predictions of the proposed\nsimplified analysis.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic datasets are often presented as a silver-bullet solution to the\nproblem of privacy-preserving data publishing. However, for many applications,\nsynthetic data has been shown to have limited utility when used to train\npredictive models. One promising potential application of these data is in the\nexploratory phase of the machine learning workflow, which involves\nunderstanding, engineering and selecting features. This phase often involves\nconsiderable time, and depends on the availability of data. There would be\nsubstantial value in synthetic data that permitted these steps to be carried\nout while, for example, data access was being negotiated, or with fewer\ninformation governance restrictions. This paper presents an empirical analysis\nof the agreement between the feature importance obtained from raw and from\nsynthetic data, on a range of artificially generated and real-world datasets\n(where feature importance represents how useful each feature is when predicting\na the outcome). We employ two differentially-private methods to produce\nsynthetic data, and apply various utility measures to quantify the agreement in\nfeature importance as this varies with the level of privacy. Our results\nindicate that synthetic data can sometimes preserve several representations of\nthe ranking of feature importance in simple settings but their performance is\nnot consistent and depends upon a number of factors. Particular caution should\nbe exercised in more nuanced real-world settings, where synthetic data can lead\nto differences in ranked feature importance that could alter key modelling\ndecisions. This work has important implications for developing synthetic\nversions of highly sensitive data sets in fields such as finance and\nhealthcare.",

    "abstract": "Fast, autonomous flight in unstructured, cluttered environments such as\nforests is challenging because it requires the robot to compute new plans in\nrealtime on a computationally-constrained platform. In this paper, we enable\nthis capability with a search-based planning framework that adapts sampling\ndensity in realtime to find dynamically-feasible plans while remaining\ncomputationally tractable. A paramount challenge in search-based planning is\nthat dense obstacles both necessitate large graphs (to guarantee completeness)\nand reduce the efficiency of graph search (as heuristics become less accurate).\nTo address this, we develop a planning framework with two parts: one that\nmaximizes planner completeness for a given graph size, and a second that\ndynamically maximizes graph size subject to computational constraints. This\nframework is enabled by motion planning graphs that are defined by a single\nparameter, dispersion, which quantifies the maximum trajectory cost to reach an\narbitrary state from the graph. We show through real and simulated experiments\nhow the dispersion can be adapted to different environments in realtime,\nallowing operation in environments with varying density. The simulated\nexperiment demonstrates improved performance over a baseline search-based\nplanning algorithm. We also demonstrate flight speeds of up to 2.5m/s in\nreal-world cluttered pine forests.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread adoption of deep learning, reinforcement learning (RL)\nhas experienced a dramatic increase in popularity, scaling to previously\nintractable problems, such as playing complex games from pixel observations,\nsustaining conversations with humans, and controlling robotic agents. However,\nthere is still a wide range of domains inaccessible to RL due to the high cost\nand danger of interacting with the environment. Offline RL is a paradigm that\nlearns exclusively from static datasets of previously collected interactions,\nmaking it feasible to extract policies from large and diverse training\ndatasets. Effective offline RL algorithms have a much wider range of\napplications than online RL, being particularly appealing for real-world\napplications such as education, healthcare, and robotics. In this work, we\npropose a unifying taxonomy to classify offline RL methods. Furthermore, we\nprovide a comprehensive review of the latest algorithmic breakthroughs in the\nfield, and a review of existing benchmarks' properties and shortcomings.\nFinally, we provide our perspective on open problems and propose future\nresearch directions for this rapidly growing field.",

    "abstract": "Cut-based directed graph (digraph) clustering often focuses on finding dense\nwithin-cluster or sparse between-cluster connections, similar to cut-based\nundirected graph clustering methods. In contrast, for flow-based clusterings\nthe edges between clusters tend to be oriented in one direction and have been\nfound in migration data, food webs, and trade data. In this paper we introduce\na spectral algorithm for finding flow-based clusterings. The proposed algorithm\nis based on recent work which uses complex-valued Hermitian matrices to\nrepresent digraphs. By establishing an algebraic relationship between a\ncomplex-valued Hermitian representation and an associated real-valued,\nskew-symmetric matrix the proposed algorithm produces clusterings while\nremaining completely in the real field. Our algorithm uses less memory and\nasymptotically less computation while provably preserving solution quality. We\nalso show the algorithm can be easily implemented using standard computational\nbuilding blocks, possesses better numerical properties, and loans itself to a\nnatural interpretation via an objective function relaxation argument.",

To\nfacilitate robot autonomy, robust and accurate state-estimation remains a core\ncomponent to enable these machines for operation in a diverse set of complex\nenvironments. In this work, a method for multi-modal sensor fusion for robot\nstate-estimation and localization is presented, enabling operation of\nconstruction robots in real-world scenarios. The proposed approach presents a\ngraph-based prediction-update loop that combines the benefits of filtering and\nsmoothing in order to provide consistent state estimates at high update rate,\nwhile maintaining accurate global localization for large-scale earth-moving\nexcavators. Furthermore, the proposed approach enables a flexible integration\nof asynchronous sensor measurements and provides consistent pose estimates even\nduring phases of sensor dropout. For this purpose, a dual-graph design for\nswitching between two distinct optimization problems is proposed, directly\naddressing temporary failure and the subsequent return of global position\nestimates. The proposed approach is implemented on-board two Menzi Muck walking\nexcavators and validated during real-world tests conducted in representative\noperational environments.",

This paper introduces the 3C concept, an integrative\nmulti-system and multi-stakeholder optimization approach for managing\ninfrastructure interventions (e.g., maintenance, renovation, etc.). The\nproposed approach takes advantage of the benefits achieved by grouping (i.e.,\noptimizing) intervention activities. Intervention optimization leads to\nsubstantial savings on both direct intervention costs (operator) and indirect\nunavailability costs (society) by reducing the number of system interruptions.\nThe proposed optimization approach is formalized into a structured mathematical\nmodel that can account for the interactions between multiple infrastructure\nnetworks and the impact on multiple stakeholders (e.g., society and\ninfrastructure operators), and it can accommodate different types of\nintervention, such as maintenance, removal, and upgrading. The different types\nof interdependencies, within and across infrastructures, are modeled using a\nproposed interaction matrix (IM). The IM allows integrating the interventions\nof different infrastructure networks whose interventions are normally planned\nindependently. Moreover, the introduced 3C concept accounts for central\ninterventions, which are those that must occur at a pre-established time\nmoment, where neither delay nor advance is permitted. To demonstrate the\napplicability of the proposed approach, an illustrative example of a\nmulti-system and multi-actor intervention planning is introduced. Results show\na substantial reduction in the operator and societal costs. In addition, the\noptimal intervention program obtained in the analysis shows no predictable\npatterns, which indicates it is a useful managerial decision support tool.",

However, as\nthese systems get more complex, timing errors can occur between the components\nthereby violating the assumption about events being simultaneous (or periodic).\nWe consider the problem of a surgical navigation system where optical markers\ndetected in the 2D pictures taken by two cameras are used to localize the\nmarkers in 3D space. A predefined array of such markers, known as a reference\nelement, is used to navigate the corresponding CAD model of a surgical\ninstrument on patient's images.

In this\npaper, we present ICARUS, a novel lightweight graphics architecture tailored\nfor NeRF rendering. Unlike GPUs using general purpose computing and memory\narchitectures for NeRF, ICARUS executes the complete NeRF pipeline using\ndedicated plenoptic cores (PLCore) consisting of a positional encoding unit\n(PEU), a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) engine, and a volume rendering unit\n(VRU). A PLCore takes in positions \\& directions and renders the corresponding\npixel colors without any intermediate data going off-chip for temporary storage\nand exchange, which can be time and power consuming. To implement the most\nexpensive component of NeRF, i.e., the MLP, we transform the fully connected\noperations to approximated reconfigurable multiple constant multiplications\n(MCMs), where common subexpressions are shared across different multiplications\nto improve the computation efficiency. We build a prototype ICARUS using\nSynopsys HAPS-80 S104, an FPGA-based prototyping system for large-scale\nintegrated circuits and systems. We evaluate the area and power consumption of\na PLCore using 40nm LP CMOS process. Working at 300 MHz, a single PLCore\noccupies 7.59 $mm^2$ and consumes 309.8 mW, translating to 0.174 uJ/sample.\nEvaluation results show that for NeRF rendering, the energy efficiency of\nICARUS is 146 times higher than GPUs.

In situations where some\nclasses are more difficult to be distinguished compared to others and where\nclasses might be organised in a hierarchy of categories, current DL methods can\nnot work well. In this study, a novel hierarchical cavitation intensity\nrecognition framework using Sub-Main Transfer Network, termed SMTNet, is\nproposed to classify acoustic signals of valve cavitation. SMTNet model outputs\nmultiple predictions ordered from coarse to fine along a network corresponding\nto a hierarchy of target cavitation states. Firstly, a data augmentation method\nbased on Sliding Window with Fast Fourier Transform (Swin-FFT) is developed to\nsolve few-shot problem. Secondly, a 1-D double hierarchical residual block (1-D\nDHRB) is presented to capture sensitive features of the frequency domain valve\nacoustic signals. Thirdly, hierarchical multi-label tree is proposed to assist\nthe embedding of the semantic structure of target cavitation states into\nSMTNet. Fourthly, experience filtering mechanism is proposed to fully learn a\nprior knowledge of cavitation detection model. Finally, SMTNet has been\nevaluated on two cavitation datasets without noise (Dataset 1 and Dataset 2),\nand one cavitation dataset with real noise (Dataset 3) provided by SAMSON AG\n(Frankfurt).

Failure probability\nestimation involves resolving tails of probability distribution, and Monte\nCarlo sampling methods are intractable when expensive high-fidelity simulations\nhave to be queried.

Specifically, we propose the\nuse of multifidelity Gaussian process models to efficiently fuse models at\nmultiple fidelity, thereby offering a cheap surrogate model that emulates the\noriginal model at all fidelities. Furthermore, we propose a novel sequential\n\\emph{acquisition function}-based experiment design framework that can\nautomatically select samples from appropriate fidelity models to make\npredictions about quantities of interest in the highest fidelity. We use our\nproposed approach in an importance sampling setting and demonstrate our method\non the failure level set estimation and probability estimation on synthetic\ntest functions as well as two real-world applications, namely, the reliability\nanalysis of a gas turbine engine blade using a finite element method and a\ntransonic aerodynamic wing test case using Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes\nequations.

This new occupancy format is a polygon\ncomposed of a bunch of vertexes selected from radar measurements, which covers\nfree space inside and gives a Doppler moving velocity for each vertex.

To fit this new polygon\nrepresentation, a matrix-form collision detection method have been modeled as\nwell. The radar polygon algorithms and collision detection model have been\nvalidated via extensive experiments with real collected data and simulations,\nshowing that the deformable radar polygon is very competitive in terms of its\ncompleteness, smoothness, accuracy, lightweight as well as shape-predictable\nproperty.

Increasingly, legislators,\nregulators and advocates have turned to assessment documentation in order to\naddress the gap between the public's experience of algorithmic harms and the\nobligations of developers to document and justify their design decisions.\nHowever, issues of standing and expertise currently prevent publics from\ncohering around shared interests in preventing and redressing algorithmic\nharms; as we demonstrate with multiple cases, courts often find computational\nharms non-cognizable and rarely require developers to address material claims\nof harm. Constructed with a triadic accountability relationship, algorithmic\nimpact assessment regimes could alter this situation by establishing procedural\nrights around public access to reporting and documentation. Developing a\nrelational approach to accountability, we argue that robust accountability\nregimes must establish opportunities for publics to cohere around shared\nexperiences and interests, and to contest the outcomes of algorithmic systems\nthat affect their lives. Furthermore, algorithmic accountability policies\ncurrently under consideration in many jurisdictions must provide the public\nwith adequate standing and opportunities to access and contest the\ndocumentation provided by the actors and the judgments passed by the forum.",

One such effort is California's project Roomkey\nthat provided emergency housing to over 2000 vulnerable persons but fell short\nof the set goal of 15,000. It is projected that the homelessness problem will\nonly get worse after the pandemic. With that in mind, we borrow from efforts\nlike project Roomkey and suggest a solution that looks to improve upon these\nefforts to efficiently assign housing to the unhoused in our communities. The\npandemic, together with the project Roomkey, shed light on the underlying\nsupply demand mismatch that presents an opportunity for a matching mechanism\nsolution to assigning housing options to the unhoused in a way that maximizes\nsocial welfare and minimizes susceptibility to strategic manipulation.\nAdditionally, we argue that this automated solution would cut down on the\namount of funding and personnel required for the assignment of housing to\nunhoused persons.

Recently, lots of methods have been proposed from\nthe perspective of meta-learning and representation learning for improving FSL\nperformance. However, few works focus on the interpretability of FSL decision\nprocess. In this paper, we take a step towards the interpretable FSL by\nproposing a novel decision tree-based meta-learning framework, namely, MetaDT.\nOur insight is replacing the last black-box FSL classifier of the existing\nrepresentation learning methods by an interpretable decision tree with\nmeta-learning. The key challenge is how to effectively learn the decision tree\n(i.e., the tree structure and the parameters of each node) in the FSL setting.\nTo address the challenge, we introduce a tree-like class hierarchy as our\nprior: 1) the hierarchy is directly employed as the tree structure; 2) by\nregarding the class hierarchy as an undirected graph, a graph convolution-based\ndecision tree inference network is designed as our meta-learner to learn to\ninfer the parameters of each node. At last, a two-loop optimization mechanism\nis incorporated into our framework for a fast adaptation of the decision tree\nwith few examples. Extensive experiments on performance comparison and\ninterpretability analysis show the effectiveness and superiority of our MetaDT.\nOur code will be publicly available upon acceptance.",

It also shows great potentials in a wide\nrange of image manipulation tasks. However, the paradigm of SinGAN has\nlimitations in terms of generation quality and training time. Firstly, due to\nthe lack of high-level information, SinGAN cannot handle the object images well\nas it does on the scene and texture images. Secondly, the separate progressive\ntraining scheme is time-consuming and easy to cause artifact accumulation. To\ntackle these problems, in this paper, we dig into the SIG problem and improve\nSinGAN by fully-utilization of internal and external priors. The main\ncontributions of this paper include: 1) We introduce to SIG a regularized\nlatent variable model.

    "abstract": "Smart grids are intelligent power transmission networks that monitor and\ncontrol communication participants and grid nodes to ensure bidirectional flow\nof information and power between all nodes. To secure the smart grid, it is\nvery important to design the key agreement protocol. The pairing-free\ncertificateless two-party authenticated key agreement protocol has been widely\nstudied and applied as a basic core protocol to protect the security of the\nsmart grid. Until now, various protocols have been proposed, and these\nprotocols are being introduced and operated not only in smart grid, but also in\nsmart cities, healthcare, and vehicle ad hoc networks. In this paper, we\nanalyzed the security properties of two recently proposed pairing-free\ncertificateless two-party authenticated key agreement protocols for Smart grid.\nAccording to our analysis, these two protocols are insecure against basic\nimpersonation attacks of malicious key-generator centers, man-in-the-middle\nattacks of malicious key generator centers, and key offset attacks. We also\nfound and pointed out some errors in the descriptions of these protocols.",

    "abstract": "The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is one of the most widely used performance\nmeasures for classification models in machine learning. However, it summarizes\nthe true positive rates (TPRs) over all false positive rates (FPRs) in the ROC\nspace, which may include the FPRs with no practical relevance in some\napplications. The partial AUC, as a generalization of the AUC, summarizes only\nthe TPRs over a specific range of the FPRs and is thus a more suitable\nperformance measure in many real-world situations. Although partial AUC\noptimization in a range of FPRs had been studied, existing algorithms are not\nscalable to big data and not applicable to deep learning. To address this\nchallenge, we cast the problem into a non-smooth difference-of-convex (DC)\nprogram for any smooth predictive functions (e.g., deep neural networks), which\nallowed us to develop an efficient approximated gradient descent method based\non the Moreau envelope smoothing technique, inspired by recent advances in\nnon-smooth DC optimization. To increase the efficiency of large data\nprocessing, we used an efficient stochastic block coordinate update in our\nalgorithm. Our proposed algorithm can also be used to minimize the sum of\nranked range loss, which also lacks efficient solvers. We established a\ncomplexity of $\\tilde O(1/\\epsilon^6)$ for finding a nearly $\\epsilon$-critical\nsolution. Finally, we numerically demonstrated the effectiveness of our\nproposed algorithms for both partial AUC maximization and sum of ranked range\nloss minimization.",

Based on a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)\nformulation comprised of the observable sensor dynamics, unobservable target\nstates, and accompanying observation laws, we present a distributed\ninformation-driven solution approach to the multi-agent target tracking\nproblem, namely, sequential multi-agent nominal belief-state optimization\n(SMA-NBO).

SMA-NBO\nincorporates a computationally efficient approximation of the target\nbelief-state over the horizon. The agent-by-agent decision-making is capable of\nleveraging on-board (edge) compute for selecting (sub-optimal) target-tracking\nmaneuvers exhibiting non-myopic cooperative fleet behavior. The optimization\nproblem explicitly incorporates semantic information defining target occlusions\nfrom a world model. To illustrate the efficacy of our approach, a random\nocclusion forest environment is simulated. SMA-NBO is compared to other\nbaseline approaches. The simulation results show SMA-NBO 1) maintains tracking\nperformance and reduces the computational cost by replacing the calculation of\nthe expected target trajectory with a single sample trajectory based on maximum\na posteriori estimation; 2) generates cooperative fleet decision by\nsequentially optimizing single-agent policy with efficient usage of other\nagents' policy of intent; 3) aptly incorporates the multiple weighted trace\npenalty (MWTP) HECTG, which improves tracking performance with a\ncomputationally efficient heuristic.",

The hard predictions are made when\nperforming semantic segmentation such that each point is associated with a\nsingle class. However, the errors stemming from hard decision propagate into\ngrouping that results in (1) low overlaps between the predicted instance with\nthe ground truth and (2) substantial false positives. To address the\naforementioned problems, this paper proposes a 3D instance segmentation method\nreferred to as SoftGroup by performing bottom-up soft grouping followed by\ntop-down refinement. SoftGroup allows each point to be associated with multiple\nclasses to mitigate the problems stemming from semantic prediction errors and\nsuppresses false positive instances by learning to categorize them as\nbackground. Experimental results on different datasets and multiple evaluation\nmetrics demonstrate the efficacy of SoftGroup.

    "abstract": "Spurious correlations pose a major challenge for robust machine learning.\nModels trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) may learn to rely on\ncorrelations between class labels and spurious attributes, leading to poor\nperformance on data groups without these correlations. This is particularly\nchallenging to address when spurious attribute labels are unavailable. To\nimprove worst-group performance on spuriously correlated data without training\nattribute labels, we propose Correct-N-Contrast (CNC), a contrastive approach\nto directly learn representations robust to spurious correlations. As ERM\nmodels can be good spurious attribute predictors, CNC works by (1) using a\ntrained ERM model's outputs to identify samples with the same class but\ndissimilar spurious features, and (2) training a robust model with contrastive\nlearning to learn similar representations for same-class samples. To support\nCNC, we introduce new connections between worst-group error and a\nrepresentation alignment loss that CNC aims to minimize. We empirically observe\nthat worst-group error closely tracks with alignment loss, and prove that the\nalignment loss over a class helps upper-bound the class's worst-group vs.\naverage error gap. On popular benchmarks, CNC reduces alignment loss\ndrastically, and achieves state-of-the-art worst-group accuracy by 3.6% average\nabsolute lift.

    "abstract": "Despite the success of deep neural networks, there are still many challenges\nin deep representation learning due to the data scarcity issues such as data\nimbalance, unseen distribution, and domain shift. To address the\nabove-mentioned issues, a variety of methods have been devised to explore the\nsample relationships in a vanilla way (i.e., from the perspectives of either\nthe input or the loss function), failing to explore the internal structure of\ndeep neural networks for learning with sample relationships. Inspired by this,\nwe propose to enable deep neural networks themselves with the ability to learn\nthe sample relationships from each mini-batch. Specifically, we introduce a\nbatch transformer module or BatchFormer, which is then applied into the batch\ndimension of each mini-batch to implicitly explore sample relationships during\ntraining. By doing this, the proposed method enables the collaboration of\ndifferent samples, e.g., the head-class samples can also contribute to the\nlearning of the tail classes for long-tailed recognition. Furthermore, to\nmitigate the gap between training and testing, we share the classifier between\nwith or without the BatchFormer during training, which can thus be removed\nduring testing. We perform extensive experiments on over ten datasets and the\nproposed method achieves significant improvements on different data scarcity\napplications without any bells and whistles, including the tasks of long-tailed\nrecognition, compositional zero-shot learning, domain generalization, and\ncontrastive learning.

Specifically, for $d$-dimensional Gaussian\ndistributions with known covariance $\\Sigma$, we can test whether the\ndistribution comes from $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu^*, \\Sigma)$ for some fixed $\\mu^*$ or\nfrom some $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma)$ with total variation distance at least\n$\\alpha$ from $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu^*, \\Sigma)$ with $(\\varepsilon, 0)$-differential\nprivacy, using only \\[\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{d^{1/2}}{\\alpha^2} +\n\\frac{d^{1/3}}{\\alpha^{4/3} \\cdot \\varepsilon^{2/3}} + \\frac{1}{\\alpha \\cdot\n\\varepsilon}\\right)\\] samples if the algorithm is allowed to be computationally\ninefficient, and only \\[\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{d^{1/2}}{\\alpha^2} +\n\\frac{d^{1/4}}{\\alpha \\cdot \\varepsilon}\\right)\\] samples for a computationally\nefficient algorithm. We also provide a matching lower bound showing that our\ncomputationally inefficient algorithm has optimal sample complexity. We also\nextend our algorithms to various related problems, including mean testing of\nGaussians with bounded but unknown covariance, uniformity testing of product\ndistributions over $\\{\\pm 1\\}^d$, and tolerant testing.\nOur results improve over the previous best work of Canonne, Kamath, McMillan,\nUllman, and Zakynthinou \\cite{CanonneKMUZ20} for both computationally efficient\nand inefficient algorithms, and even our computationally efficient algorithm\nmatches the optimal \\emph{non-private} sample complexity of\n$O\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\\alpha^2}\\right)$ in many standard parameter settings.\nIn addition, our results show that, surprisingly, private identity testing of\n$d$-dimensional Gaussians can be done with fewer samples than private identity\ntesting of discrete distributions over a domain of size $d$ \\cite{AcharyaSZ18},\nwhich refutes a conjectured lower bound of Canonne et al. \\cite{CanonneKMUZ20}.",

    "abstract": "Although domain adaptation has been extensively studied in natural\nimage-based segmentation task, the research on cross-domain segmentation for\nvery high resolution (VHR) remote sensing images (RSIs) still remains\nunderexplored. The VHR RSIs-based cross-domain segmentation mainly faces two\ncritical challenges: 1) Large area land covers with many diverse object\ncategories bring severe local patch-level data distribution deviations, thus\nyielding different adaptation difficulties for different local patches; 2)\nDifferent VHR sensor types or dynamically changing modes cause the VHR images\nto go through intensive data distribution differences even for the same\ngeographical location, resulting in different global feature-level domain gap.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a curriculum-style local-to-global\ncross-domain adaptation framework for the segmentation of VHR RSIs. The\nproposed curriculum-style adaptation performs the adaptation process in an\neasy-to-hard way according to the adaptation difficulties that can be obtained\nusing an entropy-based score for each patch of the target domain, and thus well\naligns the local patches in a domain image. The proposed local-to-global\nadaptation performs the feature alignment process from the locally semantic to\nglobally structural feature discrepancies, and consists of a semantic-level\ndomain classifier and an entropy-level domain classifier that can reduce the\nabove cross-domain feature discrepancies. Extensive experiments have been\nconducted in various cross-domain scenarios, including geographic location\nvariations and imaging mode variations, and the experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method can significantly boost the domain\nadaptability of segmentation networks for VHR RSIs.

    "abstract": "Temporal action detection (TAD) is an important yet challenging task in video\nanalysis. Most existing works draw inspiration from image object detection and\ntend to reformulate it as a proposal generation - classification problem.\nHowever, there are two caveats with this paradigm. First, proposals are not\nequipped with annotated labels, which have to be empirically compiled, thus the\ninformation in the annotations is not necessarily precisely employed in the\nmodel training process. Second, there are large variations in the temporal\nscale of actions, and neglecting this fact may lead to deficient representation\nin the video features. To address these issues and precisely model temporal\naction detection, we formulate the task of temporal action detection in a novel\nperspective of semantic segmentation. Owing to the 1-dimensional property of\nTAD, we are able to convert the coarse-grained detection annotations to\nfine-grained semantic segmentation annotations for free. We take advantage of\nthem to provide precise supervision so as to mitigate the impact induced by the\nimprecise proposal labels. We propose an end-to-end framework SegTAD composed\nof a 1D semantic segmentation network (1D-SSN) and a proposal detection network\n(PDN).",

However, previous prompt-based methods\nfor few-shot NER have limitations such as a higher computational complexity,\npoor zero-shot ability, requiring manual prompt engineering, or lack of prompt\nrobustness. In this work, we address these shortcomings by proposing a new\nprompt-based learning NER method with Question Answering (QA), called QaNER.\nOur approach includes 1) a refined strategy for converting NER problems into\nthe QA formulation; 2) NER prompt generation for QA models; 3) prompt-based\ntuning with QA models on a few annotated NER examples; 4) zero-shot NER by\nprompting the QA model.

However, deep SNNs are not easy to\ntrain due to the excessive firing of spiking neurons in the hidden layers.

This normalization removes the\nsubtraction term from the standard normalization and uses the second raw moment\ninstead of the variance as the division term. The spike firing can be\ncontrolled, enabling the training to proceed appropriating, by conducting this\nsimple normalization to the postsynaptic potential. The experimental results\nshow that SNNs with our normalization outperformed other models using other\nnormalizations.

    "abstract": "Certain forms of uncertainty that robotic systems encounter can be explicitly\nlearned within the context of a known model, like parametric model\nuncertainties such as mass and moments of inertia. Quantifying such parametric\nuncertainty is important for more accurate prediction of the system behavior,\nleading to safe and precise task execution. In tandem, providing a form of\nrobustness guarantee against prevailing uncertainty levels like environmental\ndisturbances and current model knowledge is also desirable. To that end, the\nauthors' previously proposed RATTLE algorithm, a framework for online\ninformation-aware motion planning, is outlined and extended to enhance its\napplicability to real robotic systems. RATTLE provides a clear tradeoff between\ninformation-seeking motion and traditional goal-achieving motion and features\nonline-updateable models. Additionally, online-updateable low level control\nrobustness guarantees and a new method for automatic adjustment of information\ncontent down to a specified estimation precision is proposed.

    "title": "A Characterization of Multiclass Learnability",
    "abstract": "A seminal result in learning theory characterizes the PAC learnability of\nbinary classes through the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension. Extending this\ncharacterization to the general multiclass setting has been open since the\npioneering works on multiclass PAC learning in the late 1980s. This work\nresolves this problem: we characterize multiclass PAC learnability through the\nDS dimension, a combinatorial dimension defined by Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz\n(2014).\nThe classical characterization of the binary case boils down to empirical\nrisk minimization. In contrast, our characterization of the multiclass case\ninvolves a variety of algorithmic ideas; these include a natural setting we\ncall list PAC learning. In the list learning setting, instead of predicting a\nsingle outcome for a given unseen input, the goal is to provide a short menu of\npredictions.\nOur second main result concerns the Natarajan dimension, which has been a\ncentral candidate for characterizing multiclass learnability. This dimension\nwas introduced by Natarajan (1988) as a barrier for PAC learning. Whether the\nNatarajan dimension characterizes PAC learnability in general has been posed as\nan open question in several papers since. This work provides a negative answer:\nwe construct a non-learnable class with Natarajan dimension one.\nFor the construction, we identify a fundamental connection between concept\nclasses and topology (i.e., colorful simplicial complexes). We crucially rely\non a deep and involved construction of hyperbolic pseudo-manifolds by\nJanuszkiewicz and Swiatkowski. It is interesting that hyperbolicity is directly\nrelated to learning problems that are difficult to solve although no obvious\nbarriers exist. This is another demonstration of the fruitful links machine\nlearning has with different areas in mathematics.",

    "abstract": "Vanilla neural architecture search using evolutionary algorithms (EA)\ninvolves evaluating each architecture by training it from scratch, which is\nextremely time-consuming. This can be reduced by using a supernet to estimate\nthe fitness of every architecture in the search space due to its weight sharing\nnature. However, the estimated fitness is very noisy due to the co-adaptation\nof the operations in the supernet. In this work, we propose a method called\npEvoNAS wherein the whole neural architecture search space is progressively\nreduced to smaller search space regions with good architectures. This is\nachieved by using a trained supernet for architecture evaluation during the\narchitecture search using genetic algorithm to find search space regions with\ngood architectures. Upon reaching the final reduced search space, the supernet\nis then used to search for the best architecture in that search space using\nevolution. The search is also enhanced by using weight inheritance wherein the\nsupernet for the smaller search space inherits its weights from previous\ntrained supernet for the bigger search space. Exerimentally, pEvoNAS gives\nbetter results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 while using significantly less\ncomputational resources as compared to previous EA-based methods.

Many works based on Convolution\nNeural Networks (CNNs) for face PAD formulate the problem as an image-level\nbinary classification task without considering the context. Alternatively,\nVision Transformers (ViT) using self-attention to attend the context of an\nimage become the mainstreams in face PAD. Inspired by ViT, we propose a\nVideo-based Transformer for face PAD (ViTransPAD) with short/long-range\nspatio-temporal attention which can not only focus on local details with short\nattention within a frame but also capture long-range dependencies over frames.\nInstead of using coarse image patches with single-scale as in ViT, we propose\nthe Multi-scale Multi-Head Self-Attention (MsMHSA) architecture to accommodate\nmulti-scale patch partitions of Q, K, V feature maps to the heads of\ntransformer in a coarse-to-fine manner, which enables to learn a fine-grained\nrepresentation to perform pixel-level discrimination for face PAD. Due to lack\ninductive biases of convolutions in pure transformers, we also introduce\nconvolutions to the proposed ViTransPAD to integrate the desirable properties\nof CNNs by using convolution patch embedding and convolution projection. The\nextensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed ViTransPAD with a\npreferable accuracy-computation balance, which can serve as a new backbone for\nface PAD.",

    "title": "Graph Representation Learning Beyond Node and Homophily",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised graph representation learning aims to distill various graph\ninformation into a downstream task-agnostic dense vector embedding. However,\nexisting graph representation learning approaches are designed mainly under the\nnode homophily assumption: connected nodes tend to have similar labels and\noptimize performance on node-centric downstream tasks. Their design is\napparently against the task-agnostic principle and generally suffers poor\nperformance in tasks, e.g., edge classification, that demands feature signals\nbeyond the node-view and homophily assumption. To condense different feature\nsignals into the embeddings, this paper proposes PairE, a novel unsupervised\ngraph embedding method using two paired nodes as the basic unit of embedding to\nretain the high-frequency signals between nodes to support node-related and\nedge-related tasks. Accordingly, a multi-self-supervised autoencoder is\ndesigned to fulfill two pretext tasks: one retains the high-frequency signal\nbetter, and another enhances the representation of commonality. Our extensive\nexperiments on a diversity of benchmark datasets clearly show that PairE\noutperforms the unsupervised state-of-the-art baselines, with up to 101.1\\%\nrelative improvement on the edge classification tasks that rely on both the\nhigh and low-frequency signals in the pair and up to 82.5\\% relative\nperformance gain on the node classification tasks.",

It is focused on capturing the word\nco-occurrences in a document and hence often suffers from poor performance in\nanalyzing short documents. In addition, its parameter estimation often relies\non approximate posterior inference that is either not scalable or suffers from\nlarge approximation error. This paper introduces a new topic-modeling framework\nwhere each document is viewed as a set of word embedding vectors and each topic\nis modeled as an embedding vector in the same embedding space. Embedding the\nwords and topics in the same vector space, we define a method to measure the\nsemantic difference between the embedding vectors of the words of a document\nand these of the topics, and optimize the topic embeddings to minimize the\nexpected difference over all documents. Experiments on text analysis\ndemonstrate that the proposed method, which is amenable to mini-batch\nstochastic gradient descent based optimization and hence scalable to big\ncorpora, provides competitive performance in discovering more coherent and\ndiverse topics and extracting better document representations.",

    "abstract": "Matching cost construction is a key step in light field (LF) depth\nestimation, but was rarely studied in the deep learning era. Recent deep\nlearning-based LF depth estimation methods construct matching cost by\nsequentially shifting each sub-aperture image (SAI) with a series of predefined\noffsets, which is complex and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple and fast cost constructor to construct matching cost for LF depth\nestimation. Our cost constructor is composed by a series of convolutions with\nspecifically designed dilation rates. By applying our cost constructor to SAI\narrays, pixels under predefined disparities can be integrated and matching cost\ncan be constructed without using any shifting operation. More importantly, the\nproposed cost constructor is occlusion-aware and can handle occlusions by\ndynamically modulating pixels from different views. Based on the proposed cost\nconstructor, we develop a deep network for LF depth estimation. Our network\nranks first on the commonly used 4D LF benchmark in terms of the mean square\nerror (MSE), and achieves a faster running time than other state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Prioritizing fairness is of central importance in artificial intelligence\n(AI) systems, especially for those societal applications, e.g., hiring systems\nshould recommend applicants equally from different demographic groups, and risk\nassessment systems must eliminate racism in criminal justice. Existing efforts\ntowards the ethical development of AI systems have leveraged data science to\nmitigate biases in the training set or introduced fairness principles into the\ntraining process. For a deployed AI system, however, it may not allow for\nretraining or tuning in practice. By contrast, we propose a more flexible\napproach, i.e., fairness-aware adversarial perturbation (FAAP), which learns to\nperturb input data to blind deployed models on fairness-related features, e.g.,\ngender and ethnicity. The key advantage is that FAAP does not modify deployed\nmodels in terms of parameters and structures. To achieve this, we design a\ndiscriminator to distinguish fairness-related attributes based on latent\nrepresentations from deployed models. Meanwhile, a perturbation generator is\ntrained against the discriminator, such that no fairness-related features could\nbe extracted from perturbed inputs. Exhaustive experimental evaluation\ndemonstrates the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed FAAP.\nIn addition, FAAP is validated on real-world commercial deployments\n(inaccessible to model parameters), which shows the transferability of FAAP,\nforeseeing the potential of black-box adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved promising performance in\nimage recognition and gradually serves as a powerful backbone in various vision\ntasks. To satisfy the sequential input of Transformer, the tail of ViT first\nsplits each image into a sequence of visual tokens with a fixed length. Then\nthe following self-attention layers constructs the global relationship between\ntokens to produce useful representation for the downstream tasks. Empirically,\nrepresenting the image with more tokens leads to better performance, yet the\nquadratic computational complexity of self-attention layer to the number of\ntokens could seriously influence the efficiency of ViT's inference. For\ncomputational reduction, a few pruning methods progressively prune\nuninformative tokens in the Transformer encoder, while leaving the number of\ntokens before the Transformer untouched. In fact, fewer tokens as the input for\nthe Transformer encoder can directly reduce the following computational cost.\nIn this spirit, we propose a Multi-Tailed Vision Transformer (MT-ViT) in the\npaper. MT-ViT adopts multiple tails to produce visual sequences of different\nlengths for the following Transformer encoder. A tail predictor is introduced\nto decide which tail is the most efficient for the image to produce accurate\nprediction. Both modules are optimized in an end-to-end fashion, with the\nGumbel-Softmax trick.

Accordingly, we formulate a mixed-integer\nnonlinear programming (MINIP) problem to maximize the sum achievable rate over\nall subcarriers by jointly optimizing the RIS passive beamforming and\nsubcarrier matching. To solve this challenging problem, we first develop a\nbranch-and-bound (BnB)-based alternating optimization algorithm to obtain a\nnear-optimal solution by alternatively optimizing the subcarrier matching by\nthe BnB method and the RIS passive beamforming by using semidefinite relaxation\ntechniques. Then, a low-complexity difference-of-convex penalty-based algorithm\nis proposed to reduce the computation complexity in the BnB method. To further\nreduce the computational complexity, we utilize the learning-to-optimize\napproach to learn the joint design obtained from optimization techniques, which\nis more amenable to practical implementations.

This study aims to develop a system that uses a pre-trained\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from an image,\nintegrates the features with an attention mechanism, and creates captions using\na recurrent neural network (RNN). To encode an image into a feature vector as\ngraphical attributes, we employed multiple pre-trained convolutional neural\nnetworks. Following that, a language model known as GRU is chosen as the\ndecoder to construct the descriptive sentence.

Animals' anatomy and locomotion\ncapabilities emphasize the importance of that lightweight legs and integrated,\ncompact, series elastically actuated for distal leg joints. But unlike robots,\nanimals achieve series elastic actuation by their muscle-tendon units. So far\nno designs are available that feature all characteristics of a perfect distal\nlegged locomotion actuator; a low-weight and low-inertia design, with high\nmechanical efficiency, no stick and sliding friction, low mechanical\ncomplexity, high-power output while being easy to mount. Ideally, such an\nactuator can be controlled directly and without mechanical cross-coupling, for\nexample remotely. With this goal in mind, we propose a low-friction,\nlightweight Series ELastic Diaphragm distal Actuator (SELDA) which meets many,\nalthough not all, of the above requirements. We develop, implement, and\ncharacterize a bioinspired robot leg that features a SELDA-actuated foot\nsegment. We compare two leg configurations controlled by a central pattern\ngenerator that both feature agile forward hopping. By tuning SELDA's activation\ntiming, we effectively adjust the robot's hopping height by 11% and its forward\nvelocity by 14%, even with comparatively low power injection to the distal\njoint.",

    "abstract": "Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown powerful capacity at\nmodeling structural data. However, when adapted to downstream tasks, it usually\nrequires abundant task-specific labeled data, which can be extremely scarce in\npractice. A promising solution to data scarcity is to pre-train a transferable\nand expressive GNN model on large amounts of unlabeled graphs or coarse-grained\nlabeled graphs. Then the pre-trained GNN is fine-tuned on downstream datasets\nwith task-specific fine-grained labels. In this paper, we present a novel Graph\nMatching based GNN Pre-Training framework, called GMPT. Focusing on a pair of\ngraphs, we propose to learn structural correspondences between them via neural\ngraph matching, consisting of both intra-graph message passing and inter-graph\nmessage passing. In this way, we can learn adaptive representations for a given\ngraph when paired with different graphs, and both node- and graph-level\ncharacteristics are naturally considered in a single pre-training task. The\nproposed method can be applied to fully self-supervised pre-training and\ncoarse-grained supervised pre-training. We further propose an approximate\ncontrastive training strategy to significantly reduce time/memory consumption.\nExtensive experiments on multi-domain, out-of-distribution benchmarks have\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.

    "abstract": "Randomized Hadamard Transforms (RHTs) have emerged as a computationally\nefficient alternative to the use of dense unstructured random matrices across a\nrange of domains in computer science and machine learning. For several\napplications such as dimensionality reduction and compressed sensing, the\ntheoretical guarantees for methods based on RHTs are comparable to approaches\nusing dense random matrices with i.i.d.\\ entries. However, several such\napplications are in the low-dimensional regime where the number of rows sampled\nfrom the matrix is rather small. Prior arguments are not applicable to the\nhigh-dimensional regime often found in machine learning applications like\nkernel approximation. Given an ensemble of RHTs with Gaussian diagonals,\n$\\{M^i\\}_{i = 1}^m$, and any $1$-Lipschitz function, $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to\n\\mathbb{R}$, we prove that the average of $f$ over the entries of $\\{M^i v\\}_{i\n= 1}^m$ converges to its expectation uniformly over $\\| v \\| \\leq 1$ at a rate\ncomparable to that obtained from using truly Gaussian matrices.

Recent methods for HMER have achieved\noutstanding performance with an encoder-decoder architecture. However, these\nmethods adhere to the paradigm that the prediction is made \"from one character\nto another\", which inevitably yields prediction errors due to the complicated\nstructures of mathematical expressions or crabbed handwritings. In this paper,\nwe propose a simple and efficient method for HMER, which is the first to\nincorporate syntax information into an encoder-decoder network.

In this way,\nthe proposed method can effectively describe the syntax context of expressions,\navoiding the structure prediction errors of HMER.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on large intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) and\npropose a new codebook construction method to obtain a set of pre-designed\nphase-shift configurations for the IRS unit cells. Since the complexity of\nonline optimization and the overhead for channel estimation for IRS-assisted\ncommunications scale with the size of the phase-shift codebook, the design of\nsmall codebooks is of high importance. We consider both continuous and discrete\nphase shift designs and formulate the codebook construction as optimization\nproblems. To solve the optimization problems, we propose an optimal algorithm\nfor the discrete phaseshift design and a low-complexity sub-optimal solution\nfor the continuous design. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms\nfacilitate the construction of codebooks of different sizes and with different\nbeamwidths. Moreover, the performance of the discrete phase-shift design with\n2-bit quantization is shown to approach that of the continuous phase-shift\ndesign. Finally, our simulation results show that the proposed designs enable\nlarge transmit power savings compared to the existing linear and quadratic\ncodebook designs.",

    "abstract": "The growth of data today poses a challenge in management and inference. While\nfeature extraction methods are capable of reducing the size of the data for\ninference, they do not help in minimizing the cost of data storage. On the\nother hand, feature selection helps to remove the redundant features and\ntherefore is helpful not only in inference but also in reducing management\ncosts. This work presents a novel parallel feature selection approach for\nclassification, namely Parallel Feature Selection using Trace criterion (PFST),\nwhich scales up to very large datasets. Our method uses trace criterion, a\nmeasure of class separability used in Fisher's Discriminant Analysis, to\nevaluate feature usefulness. We analyzed the criterion's desirable properties\ntheoretically. Based on the criterion, PFST rapidly finds important features\nout of a set of features for big datasets by first making a forward selection\nwith early removal of seemingly redundant features parallelly. After the most\nimportant features are included in the model, we check back their contribution\nfor possible interaction that may improve the fit. Lastly, we make a backward\nselection to check back possible redundant added by the forward steps. We\nevaluate our methods via various experiments using Linear Discriminant Analysis\nas the classifier on selected features. The experiments show that our method\ncan produce a small set of features in a fraction of the amount of time by the\nother methods under comparison. In addition, the classifier trained on the\nfeatures selected by PFST not only achieves better accuracy than the ones\nchosen by other approaches but can also achieve better accuracy than the\nclassification on all available features.",

    "abstract": "Spectral computed tomography has received considerable interest in recent\nyears since spectral measurements contain much richer information about the\nobject of interest. In spectral computed tomography, we are interested in the\nenergy channel-wise reconstructions of the object. However, such\nreconstructions suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio and share the challenges\nof conventional low-dose computed tomography such as ring artifacts. Ring\nartifacts arise from errors in the flat-field correction and can significantly\ndegrade the quality of the reconstruction. We propose an extended flat-field\nmodel that exploits high correlation in the spectral flat-fields to reduce ring\nartifacts in the channel-wise reconstructions. The extended model relies on the\nassumption that the spectral flat-fields can be well-approximated by a low-rank\nmatrix. Our proposed model works directly on the spectral flat-fields and can\nbe combined with any existing reconstruction model, e.g., filtered back\nprojection and iterative methods. The proposed model is validated on a neutron\ndata set. The results show that our method successfully diminishes ring\nartifacts and improves the quality of the reconstructions. Moreover, the\nresults indicate that our method is robust; it only needs a single spectral\nflat-field image, whereas existing methods need multiple spectral flat-field\nimages to reach a similar level of ring reduction.",

    "abstract": "A powerful approach, and one of the most common ones in structural health\nmonitoring (SHM), is to use data-driven models to make predictions and\ninferences about structures and their condition. Such methods almost\nexclusively rely on the quality of the data. Within the SHM discipline, data do\nnot always suffice to build models with satisfactory accuracy for given tasks.\nEven worse, data may be completely missing from one's dataset, regarding the\nbehaviour of a structure under different environmental conditions. In the\ncurrent work, with a view to confronting such issues, the generation of\nartificial data using a variation of the generative adversarial network (GAN)\nalgorithm, is used. The aforementioned variation is that of the conditional GAN\nor cGAN. The algorithm is not only used to generate artificial data, but also\nto learn transformations of manifolds according to some known parameters.\nAssuming that the structure's response is represented by points in a manifold,\npart of the space will be formed due to variations in external conditions\naffecting the structure. This idea proves efficient in SHM, as it is exploited\nto generate structural data for specific values of environmental coefficients.\nThe scheme is applied here on a simulated structure which operates under\ndifferent temperature and humidity conditions. The cGAN is trained on data for\nsome discrete values of the temperature within some range, and is able to\ngenerate data for every temperature in this range with satisfactory accuracy.\nThe novelty, compared to classic regression in similar problems, is that the\ncGAN allows unknown environmental parameters to affect the structure and can\ngenerate whole manifolds of data for every value of the known parameters, while\nthe unknown ones vary within the generated manifolds.",

    "abstract": "Attempts have been made recently in the field of population-based structural\nhealth monitoring (PBSHM), to transfer knowledge between SHM models of\ndifferent structures. The attempts have been focussed on homogeneous and\nheterogeneous populations. A more general approach to transferring knowledge\nbetween structures, is by considering all plausible structures as points on a\nmultidimensional base manifold and building a fibre bundle. The idea is quite\npowerful, since, a mapping between points in the base manifold and their\nfibres, the potential states of any arbitrary structure, can be learnt. A\nsmaller scale problem, but still useful, is that of learning a specific point\nof every fibre, i.e. that corresponding to the undamaged state of structures\nwithin a population. Under the framework of PBSHM, a data-driven approach to\nthe aforementioned problem is developed. Structures are converted into graphs\nand inference is attempted within a population, using a graph neural network\n(GNN) algorithm. The algorithm solves a major problem existing in such\napplications. Structures comprise different sizes and are defined as abstract\nobjects, thus attempting to perform inference within a heterogeneous population\nis not trivial. The proposed approach is tested in a simulated population of\ntrusses. The goal of the application is to predict the first natural frequency\nof trusses of different sizes, across different environmental temperatures and\nhaving different bar member types. After training the GNN using part of the\ntotal population, it was tested on trusses that were not included in the\ntraining dataset.

The exploitation of that flexibility in demand\nresponse (DR) algorithms becomes increasingly important to manage and balance\ndemand and supply in power grids. Model-free DR based on reinforcement learning\n(RL) is an attractive approach to balance such EV charging load. We build on\nprevious research on RL, based on a Markov decision process (MDP) to\nsimultaneously coordinate multiple charging stations. However, we note that the\ncomputationally expensive cost function adopted in the previous research leads\nto large training times, which limits the feasibility and practicality of the\napproach.

Specifically, for the case of load flattening, we compare the\ntwo approaches in terms of (i) the processing time to learn the RL-based\ncharging policy, as well as (ii) the overall performance of the policy\ndecisions in terms of meeting the target load for unseen test data. The\nperformance is analyzed for different training periods and varying training\nsample sizes.

These authorities may misissue\ncertificates or suffer misuse attacks, however, which has given rise to the\nCertificate Transparency (CT) project. The goal of CT is to store all issued\ncertificates in public logs, which can then be checked for the presence of\npotentially misissued certificates. Thus, the requirement that a given\ncertificate is indeed in one (or several) of these logs lies at the core of CT.\nIn its current deployment, however, most individual clients do not check that\nthe certificates they see are in logs, as requesting a proof of inclusion\ndirectly reveals the certificate and thus creates the clear potential for a\nviolation of that client's privacy. In this paper, we explore the techniques\nthat have been proposed for privacy-preserving auditing of certificate\ninclusion, focusing on their effectiveness, efficiency, and suitability in a\nnear-term deployment. In doing so, we also explore the parallels with related\nproblems involving browser clients. Guided by a set of constraints that we\ndevelop, we ultimately observe several key limitations in many proposals,\nranging from their privacy provisions to the fact that they focus on the\ninteraction between a client and a log but leave open the question of how a\nclient could privately report any certificates that are missing.",

    "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search~(NAS) has attracted increasingly more attention in\nrecent years because of its capability to design deep neural networks\nautomatically. Among them, differential NAS approaches such as DARTS, have\ngained popularity for the search efficiency. However, they suffer from two main\nissues, the weak robustness to the performance collapse and the poor\ngeneralization ability of the searched architectures. To solve these two\nproblems, a simple-but-efficient regularization method, termed as Beta-Decay,\nis proposed to regularize the DARTS-based NAS searching process. Specifically,\nBeta-Decay regularization can impose constraints to keep the value and variance\nof activated architecture parameters from too large. Furthermore, we provide\nin-depth theoretical analysis on how it works and why it works. Experimental\nresults on NAS-Bench-201 show that our proposed method can help to stabilize\nthe searching process and makes the searched network more transferable across\ndifferent datasets. In addition, our search scheme shows an outstanding\nproperty of being less dependent on training time and data. Comprehensive\nexperiments on a variety of search spaces and datasets validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Robustness and discrimination power are two fundamental requirements in\nvisual object tracking. In most tracking paradigms, we find that the features\nextracted by the popular Siamese-like networks cannot fully discriminatively\nmodel the tracked targets and distractor objects, hindering them from\nsimultaneously meeting these two requirements. While most methods focus on\ndesigning robust correlation operations, we propose a novel target-dependent\nfeature network inspired by the self-/cross-attention scheme. In contrast to\nthe Siamese-like feature extraction, our network deeply embeds cross-image\nfeature correlation in multiple layers of the feature network. By extensively\nmatching the features of the two images through multiple layers, it is able to\nsuppress non-target features, resulting in instance-varying feature extraction.\nThe output features of the search image can be directly used for predicting\ntarget locations without extra correlation step. Moreover, our model can be\nflexibly pre-trained on abundant unpaired images, leading to notably faster\nconvergence than the existing methods. Extensive experiments show our method\nachieves the state-of-the-art results while running at real-time. Our feature\nnetworks also can be applied to existing tracking pipelines seamlessly to raise\nthe tracking performance. Code will be available.",

The problem of estimating the joint probability density function\n(PDF) using semi-parametric techniques such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)\nis widely studied. However such techniques yield poor results when the\nunderlying densities are mixtures of various other families of distributions\nsuch as Laplacian or generalized Gaussian, uniform, Cauchy, etc. Further, GMMs\nare not the best choice to estimate joint distributions which are hybrid in\nnature, i.e., some random variables are discrete while others are continuous.\nWe present a novel approach for estimating the PDF using ideas from dictionary\nrepresentations in signal processing coupled with low rank tensor\ndecompositions. To the best our knowledge, this is the first work on estimating\njoint PDFs employing dictionaries alongside tensor decompositions. We create a\ndictionary of various families of distributions by inspecting the data, and use\nit to approximate each decomposed factor of the product in the mixture.

    "abstract": "Early exiting allows instances to exit at different layers according to the\nestimation of difficulty. Previous works usually adopt heuristic metrics such\nas the entropy of internal outputs to measure instance difficulty, which\nsuffers from generalization and threshold-tuning. In contrast, learning to\nexit, or learning to predict instance difficulty is a more appealing way.\nThough some effort has been devoted to employing such \"learn-to-exit\" modules,\nit is still unknown whether and how well the instance difficulty can be\nlearned. As a response, we first conduct experiments on the learnability of\ninstance difficulty, which demonstrates that modern neural models perform\npoorly on predicting instance difficulty. Based on this observation, we propose\na simple-yet-effective Hash-based Early Exiting approach (HashEE) that replaces\nthe learn-to-exit modules with hash functions to assign each token to a fixed\nexiting layer. Different from previous methods, HashEE requires no internal\nclassifiers nor extra parameters, and therefore is more efficient. Experimental\nresults on classification, regression, and generation tasks demonstrate that\nHashEE can achieve higher performance with fewer FLOPs and inference time\ncompared with previous state-of-the-art early exiting methods.",

    "abstract": "With the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) industry shifting towards Autonomy 2.0, the\nperformance of self-driving systems starts to rely heavily on large quantities\nof expert driving demonstrations. However, collecting this demonstration data\ntypically involves expensive HD sensor suites (LiDAR + RADAR + cameras), which\nquickly becomes financially infeasible at the scales required. This motivates\nthe use of commodity vision sensors for data collection, which are an order of\nmagnitude cheaper than the HD sensor suites, but offer lower fidelity. If it\nwere possible to leverage these for training an AV motion planner, observing\nthe `long tail' of driving events would become a financially viable strategy.\nAs our main contribution we show it is possible to train a high-performance\nmotion planner using commodity vision data which outperforms planners trained\non HD-sensor data for a fraction of the cost. We do this by comparing the\nautonomy system performance when training on these two different sensor\nconfigurations, and showing that we can compensate for the lower sensor\nfidelity by means of increased quantity: a planner trained on 100h of commodity\nvision data outperforms one with 25h of expensive HD data.

    "abstract": "Cross-domain person re-identification (re-ID), such as unsupervised domain\nadaptive (UDA) re-ID, aims to transfer the identity-discriminative knowledge\nfrom the source to the target domain. Existing methods commonly consider the\nsource and target domains are isolated from each other, i.e., no intermediate\nstatus is modeled between both domains. Directly transferring the knowledge\nbetween two isolated domains can be very difficult, especially when the domain\ngap is large. From a novel perspective, we assume these two domains are not\ncompletely isolated, but can be connected through intermediate domains. Instead\nof directly aligning the source and target domains against each other, we\npropose to align the source and target domains against their intermediate\ndomains for a smooth knowledge transfer. To discover and utilize these\nintermediate domains, we propose an Intermediate Domain Module (IDM) and a\nMirrors Generation Module (MGM). IDM has two functions: 1) it generates\nmultiple intermediate domains by mixing the hidden-layer features from source\nand target domains and 2) it dynamically reduces the domain gap between the\nsource / target domain features and the intermediate domain features. While IDM\nachieves good domain alignment, it introduces a side effect, i.e., the mix-up\noperation may mix the identities into a new identity and lose the original\nidentities. To compensate this, MGM is introduced by mapping the features into\nthe IDM-generated intermediate domains without changing their original\nidentity. It allows to focus on minimizing domain variations to promote the\nalignment between the source / target domain and intermediate domains, which\nreinforces IDM into IDM++. We extensively evaluate our method under both the\nUDA and domain generalization (DG) scenarios and observe that IDM++ yields\nconsistent performance improvement for cross-domain re-ID, achieving new state\nof the art.",

    "abstract": "Consumer IoT devices may suffer malware attacks, and be recruited into\nbotnets or worse. There is evidence that generic advice to device owners to\naddress IoT malware can be successful, but this does not account for emerging\nforms of persistent IoT malware. Less is known about persistent malware, which\nresides on persistent storage, requiring targeted manual effort to remove it.\nThis paper presents a field study on the removal of persistent IoT malware by\nconsumers. We partnered with an ISP to contrast remediation times of 760\ncustomers across three malware categories: Windows malware, non-persistent IoT\nmalware, and persistent IoT malware. We also contacted ISP customers identified\nas having persistent IoT malware on their network-attached storage devices,\nspecifically QSnatch. We found that persistent IoT malware exhibits a mean\ninfection duration many times higher than Windows or Mirai malware; QSnatch has\na survival probability of 30% after 180 days, whereby most if not all other\nobserved malware types have been removed. For interviewed device users, QSnatch\ninfections lasted longer, so are apparently more difficult to get rid of, yet\nparticipants did not report experiencing difficulty in following notification\ninstructions. We see two factors driving this paradoxical finding: First, most\nusers reported having high technical competency. Also, we found evidence of\nplanning behavior for these tasks and the need for multiple notifications. Our\nfindings demonstrate the critical nature of interventions from outside for\npersistent malware, since automatic scan of an AV tool or a power cycle, like\nwe are used to for Windows malware and Mirai infections, will not solve\npersistent IoT malware infections.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly is defined as a state of the system that do not conform to the normal\nbehavior. For example, the emission of neutrons in a nuclear reactor channel\nabove the specified threshold is an anomaly. Big data refers to the data set\nthat is \\emph{high volume, streaming, heterogeneous, distributed} and often\n\\emph{sparse}. Big data is not uncommon these days. For example, as per\nInternet live stats, the number of tweets posted per day has gone above 500\nmillions. Due to data explosion in data laden domains, traditional anomaly\ndetection techniques developed for small data sets scale poorly on large-scale\ndata sets. Therefore, we take an alternative approach to tackle anomaly\ndetection in big data. Essentially, there are two ways to scale anomaly\ndetection in big data. The first is based on the \\emph{online} learning and the\nsecond is based on the \\emph{distributed} learning. Our aim in the thesis is to\ntackle big data problems while detecting anomaly efficiently. To that end, we\nfirst take \\emph{streaming} issue of the big data and propose\nPassive-Aggressive GMEAN (PAGMEAN) algorithms. Although, online learning\nalgorithm can scale well over large number of data points and dimensions, they\ncan not process data when it is distributed at multiple locations; which is\nquite common these days. Therefore, we propose anomaly detection algorithm\nwhich is inherently distributed using ADMM. Finally, we present a case study on\nanomaly detection in nuclear power plant data.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing 3D objects from 2D images is both challenging for our brains\nand machine learning algorithms. To support this spatial reasoning task,\ncontextual information about the overall shape of an object is critical.\nHowever, such information is not captured by established loss terms (e.g. Dice\nloss). We propose to complement geometrical shape information by including\nmulti-scale topological features, such as connected components, cycles, and\nvoids, in the reconstruction loss. Our method calculates topological features\nfrom 3D volumetric data based on cubical complexes and uses an optimal\ntransport distance to guide the reconstruction process. This topology-aware\nloss is fully differentiable, computationally efficient, and can be added to\nany neural network. We demonstrate the utility of our loss by incorporating it\ninto SHAPR, a model for predicting the 3D cell shape of individual cells based\non 2D microscopy images. Using a hybrid loss that leverages both geometrical\nand topological information of single objects to assess their shape, we find\nthat topological information substantially improves the quality of\nreconstructions, thus highlighting its ability to extract more relevant\nfeatures from image datasets.",

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) focuses on localizing objects\nonly with the supervision of image-level classification masks. Most previous\nWSOL methods follow the classification activation map (CAM) that localizes\nobjects based on the classification structure with the multi-instance learning\n(MIL) mechanism. However, the MIL mechanism makes CAM only activate\ndiscriminative object parts rather than the whole object, weakening its\nperformance for localizing objects. To avoid this problem, this work provides a\nnovel perspective that models WSOL as a domain adaption (DA) task, where the\nscore estimator trained on the source/image domain is tested on the\ntarget/pixel domain to locate objects. Under this perspective, a DA-WSOL\npipeline is designed to better engage DA approaches into WSOL to enhance\nlocalization performance. It utilizes a proposed target sampling strategy to\nselect different types of target samples. Based on these types of target\nsamples, domain adaption localization (DAL) loss is elaborated. It aligns the\nfeature distribution between the two domains by DA and makes the estimator\nperceive target domain cues by Universum regularization.

    "abstract": "In the past decades, the excessive use of the last-generation GAN (Generative\nAdversarial Networks) models in computer vision has enabled the creation of\nartificial face images that are visually indistinguishable from genuine ones.\nThese images are particularly used in adversarial settings to create fake\nsocial media accounts and other fake online profiles. Such malicious activities\ncan negatively impact the trustworthiness of users identities. On the other\nhand, the recent development of GAN models may create high-quality face images\nwithout evidence of spatial artifacts. Therefore, reassembling uniform color\nchannel correlations is a challenging research problem. To face these\nchallenges, we need to develop efficient tools able to differentiate between\nfake and authentic face images. In this chapter, we propose a new strategy to\ndifferentiate GAN-generated images from authentic images by leveraging spectral\nband discrepancies, focusing on artificial face image synthesis. In particular,\nwe enable the digital preservation of face images using the Cross-band\nco-occurrence matrix and spatial co-occurrence matrix. Then, we implement these\ntechniques and feed them to a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architecture\nto identify the real from artificial faces. Additionally, we show that the\nperformance boost is particularly significant and achieves more than 92% in\ndifferent post-processing environments. Finally, we provide several research\nobservations demonstrating that this strategy improves a comparable detection\nmethod based only on intra-band spatial co-occurrences.",

Without\naccess to the unseen domain, the feature statistics of the batch normalization\n(BN) layer learned from a limited number of source domains is doubtlessly\nbiased for unseen domain. This would mislead the feature representation\nlearning for unseen domain and deteriorate the generalizaiton ability of the\nmodel. In this paper, we propose a novel Debiased Batch Normalization via\nGaussian Process approach (GDNorm) for generalizable person re-identification,\nwhich models the feature statistic estimation from BN layers as a dynamically\nself-refining Gaussian process to alleviate the bias to unseen domain for\nimproving the generalization. Specifically, we establish a lightweight model\nwith multiple set of domain-specific BN layers to capture the discriminability\nof individual source domain, and learn the corresponding parameters of the\ndomain-specific BN layers. These parameters of different source domains are\nemployed to deduce a Gaussian process. We randomly sample several paths from\nthis Gaussian process served as the BN estimations of potential new domains\noutside of existing source domains, which can further optimize these learned\nparameters from source domains, and estimate more accurate Gaussian process by\nthem in return, tending to real data distribution. Even without a large number\nof source domains, GDNorm can still provide debiased BN estimation by using the\nmean path of the Gaussian process, while maintaining low computational cost\nduring testing.

    "abstract": "Monitoring biodiversity is paramount to manage and protect natural resources,\nparticularly in times of global change. Collecting images of organisms over\nlarge temporal or spatial scales is a promising practice to monitor and study\nbiodiversity change of natural ecosystems, providing large amounts of data with\nminimal interference with the environment. Deep learning models are currently\nused to automate classification of organisms into taxonomic units. However,\nimprecision in these classifiers introduce a measurement noise that is\ndifficult to control and can significantly hinder the analysis and\ninterpretation of data. In our study, we show that this limitation can be\novercome by ensembles of Data-efficient image Transformers (DeiTs), which\nsignificantly outperform the previous state of the art (SOTA). We validate our\nresults on a large number of ecological imaging datasets of diverse origin, and\norganisms of study ranging from plankton to insects, birds, dog breeds, animals\nin the wild, and corals. On all the data sets we test, we achieve a new SOTA,\nwith a reduction of the error with respect to the previous SOTA ranging from\n18.48% to 87.50%, depending on the data set, and often achieving performances\nvery close to perfect classification. The main reason why ensembles of DeiTs\nperform better is not due to the single-model performance of DeiTs, but rather\nto the fact that predictions by independent models have a smaller overlap, and\nthis maximizes the profit gained by ensembling. This positions DeiT ensembles\nas the best candidate for image classification in biodiversity monitoring.",

Current approaches all follow the Siamese paradigm based\non appearance matching. However, LiDAR point clouds are usually textureless and\nincomplete, which hinders effective appearance matching. Besides, previous\nmethods greatly overlook the critical motion clues among targets. In this work,\nbeyond 3D Siamese tracking, we introduce a motion-centric paradigm to handle 3D\nSOT from a new perspective. Following this paradigm, we propose a matching-free\ntwo-stage tracker M^2-Track. At the 1^st-stage, M^2-Track localizes the target\nwithin successive frames via motion transformation. Then it refines the target\nbox through motion-assisted shape completion at the 2^nd-stage. Extensive\nexperiments confirm that M^2-Track significantly outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-arts on three large-scale datasets while running at 57FPS (~8%,\n~17%, and ~22%) precision gains on KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset\nrespectively).

For example, ranking\nfor less-known websites in search queries is known to be noisy and unstable. To\nthis end, we investigate a new node ranking problem with two important\ndistinctions: a) ranking quality, rather than the centrality estimation\nquality, as the primary objective; and b) ranking only nodes of interest, e.g.,\nwebsites that matched search criteria. We propose Sample space Partitioning\nHypothesis Ranking, or SaPHyRa, that transforms node ranking into a hypothesis\nranking in machine learning. This transformation maps nodes' centrality to the\nexpected risks of hypotheses, opening doors for theoretical machine learning\n(ML) tools. The key of SaPHyRa is to partition the sample space into exact and\napproximate subspaces. The exact subspace contains samples related to the nodes\nof interest, increasing both estimation and ranking qualities. The approximate\nspace can be efficiently sampled with ML-based techniques to provide\ntheoretical guarantees on the estimation error. Lastly, we present SaPHyRa_bc,\nan illustration of SaPHyRa on ranking nodes' betweenness centrality (BC). By\ncombining a novel bi-component sampling, a 2-hop sample partitioning, and\nimproved bounds on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, SaPHyRa_bc can\neffectively rank any node subset in BC. Its performance is up to 200x faster\nthan state-of-the-art methods in approximating BC, while its rank correlation\nto the ground truth is improved by multifold.",

    "abstract": "Optimal sampling based motion planning and trajectory optimization are two\ncompeting frameworks to generate optimal motion plans. Both frameworks have\ncomplementary properties: Sampling based planners are typically slow to\nconverge, but provide optimality guarantees. Trajectory optimizers, however,\nare typically fast to converge, but do not provide global optimality guarantees\nin nonconvex problems, e.g. scenarios with obstacles. To achieve the best of\nboth worlds, we introduce a new planner, BITKOMO, which integrates the\nasymptotically optimal Batch Informed Trees (BIT*) planner with the K-Order\nMarkov Optimization (KOMO) trajectory optimization framework. Our planner is\nanytime and maintains the same asymptotic optimality guarantees provided by\nBIT*, while also exploiting the fast convergence of the KOMO trajectory\noptimizer. We experimentally evaluate our planner on manipulation scenarios\nthat involve high dimensional configuration spaces, with up to two 7-DoF\nmanipulators, obstacles and narrow passages. BITKOMO performs better than KOMO\nby succeeding even when KOMO fails, and it outperforms BIT* in terms of\nconvergence to the optimal solution.",

    "abstract": "Despite enormous research interest and rapid application of federated\nlearning (FL) to various areas, existing studies mostly focus on supervised\nfederated learning under the horizontally partitioned local dataset setting.\nThis paper will study the unsupervised FL under the vertically partitioned\ndataset setting. Accordingly, we propose the federated principal component\nanalysis for vertically partitioned dataset (VFedPCA) method, which reduces the\ndimensionality across the joint datasets over all the clients and extracts the\nprincipal component feature information for downstream data analysis. We\nfurther take advantage of the nonlinear dimensionality reduction and propose\nthe vertical federated advanced kernel principal component analysis (VFedAKPCA)\nmethod, which can effectively and collaboratively model the nonlinear nature\nexisting in many real datasets. In addition, we study two communication\ntopologies. The first is a server-client topology where a semi-trusted server\ncoordinates the federated training, while the second is the fully-decentralized\ntopology which further eliminates the requirement of the server by allowing\nclients themselves to communicate with their neighbors. Extensive experiments\nconducted on five types of real-world datasets corroborate the efficacy of\nVFedPCA and VFedAKPCA under the vertically partitioned FL setting.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has shown great potential for modeling the physical dynamics of\ncomplex particle systems such as fluids (in Lagrangian descriptions). Existing\napproaches, however, require the supervision of consecutive particle\nproperties, including positions and velocities. In this paper, we consider a\npartially observable scenario known as fluid dynamics grounding, that is,\ninferring the state transitions and interactions within the fluid particle\nsystems from sequential visual observations of the fluid surface. We propose a\ndifferentiable two-stage network named NeuroFluid. Our approach consists of (i)\na particle-driven neural renderer, which involves fluid physical properties\ninto the volume rendering function, and (ii) a particle transition model\noptimized to reduce the differences between the rendered and the observed\nimages. NeuroFluid provides the first solution to unsupervised learning of\nparticle-based fluid dynamics by training these two models jointly. It is shown\nto reasonably estimate the underlying physics of fluids with different initial\nshapes, viscosity, and densities.

To address this issue, we focus on learning robust contrastive\nrepresentations of data on which the classifier is hard to memorize the label\nnoise under the CE loss. We propose a novel contrastive regularization function\nto learn such representations over noisy data where label noise does not\ndominate the representation learning.

First we present a data structure of size $O(n \\log\nn)$ that can compute the Fr\\'{e}chet distance between $P$ and a horizontal\nquery segment $\\overline{ab}$ in $O(\\log n)$ time, where $n$ is the number of\nvertices of $P$. In comparison to prior work, this significantly reduces the\nrequired space. We extend the type of queries allowed, as we allow a query to\nbe a horizontal segment $\\overline{ab}$ together with two points $s, t \\in P$\n(not necessarily vertices), and ask for the Fr\\'{e}chet distance between\n$\\overline{ab}$ and the curve of $P$ in between $s$ and $t$. Using\n$O(n\\log^2n)$ storage, such queries take $O(\\log^3 n)$ time, simplifying and\nsignificantly improving previous results. We then generalize our results to\nquery segments of arbitrary orientation. We present an\n$O(nk^{3+\\varepsilon}+n^2)$ size data structure, where $k \\in [1..n]$ is a\nparameter the user can choose, and $\\varepsilon > 0$ is an arbitrarily small\nconstant, such that given any segment $\\overline{ab}$ and two points $s, t \\in\nP$ we can compute the Fr\\'{e}chet distance between $\\overline{ab}$ and the\ncurve of $P$ in between $s$ and $t$ in $O((n/k)\\log^2n+\\log^4 n)$ time.

In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive\nLocal-Global Relational Network (ALGRNet) for facial AU recognition and apply\nit to facial paralysis estimation. ALGRNet mainly consists of three novel\nstructures, i.e., an adaptive region learning module which learns the adaptive\nmuscle regions based on the detected landmarks, a skip-BiLSTM module which\nmodels the latent mutual assistance and exclusion relationship among local AU\nfeatures, and a feature fusion\\&refining module which explores the\ncomplementarity between local AUs and the whole face for the local AU\nrefinement. In order to evaluate our proposed method, we migrated ALGRNet to a\nfacial paralysis dataset which is collected and annotated by medical\nprofessionals.

    "abstract": "The Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) technology enables applications to\nrun in an isolated SGX enclave environment, with elevated confidentiality and\nintegrity guarantees. Gramine Library OS facilitates execution of existing\nunmodified applications in SGX enclaves, requiring only an accompanying\nmanifest file that describes the application's security posture and\nconfiguration. However, Intel SGX is a CPU-only technology, thus Gramine\ncurrently supports CPU-only workloads. To enable a broader class of\napplications that offload computations to hardware accelerators - GPU offload,\nNIC offload, FPGA offload, TPM communications - Gramine must be augmented with\ndevice-backed mmap support and generic ioctl support. In this paper, we\ndescribe the design and implementation of this newly added support, the\ncorresponding changes to the manifest-file syntax and the requisite deep copy\nalgorithm. We evaluate our implementation on Intel Media SDK workloads and\ndiscuss the encountered caveats and limitations. Finally, we outline a use case\nfor the presented mmap/ioctl support beyond mere device communication, namely\nthe mechanism to slice the application into the trusted enclave part (where the\ncore application executes) and the untrusted shared-memory part (where insecure\nshared libraries execute).",

In this paper, an Intensity Image-based LiDAR\nFiducial Marker (IILFM) system is developed. This system only requires an\nunstructured point cloud with intensity as the input and it has no restriction\non marker placement and shape. A marker detection method that locates the\npredefined 3D fiducials in the point cloud through the intensity image is\nintroduced. Then, an approach that utilizes the detected 3D fiducials to\nestimate the LiDAR 6-DOF pose that describes the transmission from the world\ncoordinate system to the LiDAR coordinate system is developed. Moreover, all\nthese processes run in real-time (approx 40 Hz on Livox Mid-40 and approx 143\nHz on VLP-16). Qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted to\ndemonstrate that the proposed system has similar convenience and accuracy as\nthe conventional visual fiducial marker system.

Using Technology threat\navoidance theory (TTAT), this study assessed factors that influenced mobile\ndevice users' threat avoidance motivations and behaviors as it relates to\nphishing attacks. From the data collected from 137 mobile device users using a\nquestionnaire, the findings indicate that (1) mobile device users' perceived\nsusceptibility and severity of phishing attacks have a significant correlation\nwith a users' perception of the threat; (2) mobile device users' motivation to\navoid a threat is correlated to a users' behavior in avoiding threat; and (3) a\nmobile device user's susceptibility to phishing attacks can be reduced by their\nperception of the threat.

    "abstract": "Place recognition is key to Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and\nspatial perception. However, a place recognition in the wild often suffers from\nerroneous predictions due to image variations, e.g., changing viewpoints and\nstreet appearance. Integrating uncertainty estimation into the life cycle of\nplace recognition is a promising method to mitigate the impact of variations on\nplace recognition performance. However, existing uncertainty estimation\napproaches in this vein are either computationally inefficient (e.g., Monte\nCarlo dropout) or at the cost of dropped accuracy. This paper proposes STUN, a\nself-teaching framework that learns to simultaneously predict the place and\nestimate the prediction uncertainty given an input image. To this end, we first\ntrain a teacher net using a standard metric learning pipeline to produce\nembedding priors. Then, supervised by the pretrained teacher net, a student net\nwith an additional variance branch is trained to finetune the embedding priors\nand estimate the uncertainty sample by sample. During the online inference\nphase, we only use the student net to generate a place prediction in\nconjunction with the uncertainty. When compared with place recognition systems\nthat are ignorant to the uncertainty, our framework features the uncertainty\nestimation for free without sacrificing any prediction accuracy. Our\nexperimental results on the large-scale Pittsburgh30k dataset demonstrate that\nSTUN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both recognition accuracy and\nthe quality of uncertainty estimation.",

Recent clip-level VIS takes a\nshort video clip as input each time showing stronger performance than\nframe-level VIS (tracking-by-segmentation), as more temporal context from\nmultiple frames is utilized. Yet, most clip-level methods are neither\nend-to-end learnable nor real-time. These limitations are addressed by the\nrecent VIS transformer (VisTR) which performs VIS end-to-end within a clip.\nHowever, VisTR suffers from long training time due to its frame-wise dense\nattention. In addition, VisTR is not fully end-to-end learnable in multiple\nvideo clips as it requires a hand-crafted data association to link instance\ntracklets between successive clips. This paper proposes EfficientVIS, a fully\nend-to-end framework with efficient training and inference. At the core are\ntracklet query and tracklet proposal that associate and segment\nregions-of-interest (RoIs) across space and time by an iterative query-video\ninteraction. We further propose a correspondence learning that makes tracklets\nlinking between clips end-to-end learnable.

In tasks\nhaving impact on human processes, the learning of social biases may produce\ndiscriminatory, unethical and untrustworthy consequences. It is often assumed\nthat social biases stem from supervised learning on labelled data, and thus,\nSelf-Supervised Learning (SSL) wrongly appears as an efficient and bias-free\nsolution, as it does not require labelled data. However, it was recently proven\nthat a popular SSL method also incorporates biases. In this paper, we study the\nbiases of a varied set of SSL visual models, trained using ImageNet data, using\na method and dataset designed by psychological experts to measure social\nbiases. We show that there is a correlation between the type of the SSL model\nand the number of biases that it incorporates.

Finally, we conclude that a careful SSL model\nselection process can reduce the number of social biases in the deployed model,\nwhilst keeping high performance.",

    "title": "Reasoning about Counterfactuals to Improve Human Inverse Reinforcement  Learning",
    "abstract": "To collaborate well with robots, we must be able to understand their decision\nmaking. Humans naturally infer other agents' beliefs and desires by reasoning\nabout their observable behavior in a way that resembles inverse reinforcement\nlearning (IRL). Thus, robots can convey their beliefs and desires by providing\ndemonstrations that are informative for a human's IRL. An informative\ndemonstration is one that differs strongly from the learner's expectations of\nwhat the robot will do given their current understanding of the robot's\ndecision making. However, standard IRL does not model the learner's existing\nexpectations, and thus cannot do this counterfactual reasoning. We propose to\nincorporate the learner's current understanding of the robot's decision making\ninto our model of human IRL, so that our robot can select demonstrations that\nmaximize the human's understanding. We also propose a novel measure for\nestimating the difficulty for a human to predict instances of a robot's\nbehavior in unseen environments. A user study finds that our test difficulty\nmeasure correlates well with human performance and confidence. Interestingly,\nconsidering human beliefs and counterfactuals when selecting demonstrations\ndecreases human performance on easy tests, but increases performance on\ndifficult tests, providing insight on how to best utilize such models.",

    "abstract": "We study several questions related to diversifying search results. We give\nimproved approximation algorithms in each of the following problems, together\nwith some lower bounds.\n- We give a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for a diversified\nsearch ranking problem [Bansal et al., ICALP 2010] whose objective is to\nminimizes the discounted cumulative gain. Our PTAS runs in time\n$n^{2^{O(\\log(1/\\epsilon)/\\epsilon)}} \\cdot m^{O(1)}$ where $n$ denotes the\nnumber of elements in the databases. Complementing this, we show that no PTAS\ncan run in time $f(\\epsilon) \\cdot (nm)^{2^{o(1/\\epsilon)}}$ assuming Gap-ETH;\ntherefore our running time is nearly tight. Both of our bounds answer open\nquestions of Bansal et al.\n- We next consider the Max-Sum Dispersion problem, whose objective is to\nselect $k$ out of $n$ elements that maximizes the dispersion, which is defined\nas the sum of the pairwise distances under a given metric. We give a\nquasipolynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem which runs in time\n$n^{O_{\\epsilon}(\\log n)}$. This improves upon previously known polynomial-time\nalgorithms with approximate ratios 0.5 [Hassin et al., Oper. Res. Lett. 1997;\nBorodin et al., ACM Trans. Algorithms 2017]. Furthermore, we observe that known\nreductions rule out approximation schemes that run in\n$n^{\\tilde{o}_\\epsilon(\\log n)}$ time assuming ETH.\n- We consider a generalization of Max-Sum Dispersion called Max-Sum\nDiversification. In addition to the sum of pairwise distance, the objective\nincludes another function $f$. For monotone submodular $f$, we give a\nquasipolynomial-time algorithm with approximation ratio arbitrarily close to\n$(1 - 1/e)$. This improves upon the best polynomial-time algorithm which has\napproximation ratio $0.5$ by Borodin et al. Furthermore, the $(1 - 1/e)$ factor\nis tight as achieving better-than-$(1 - 1/e)$ approximation is NP-hard [Feige,\nJ. ACM 1998].",

Over several state-of-the-art\nself-supervised models including SimCLR, SwaV, MoCo V2 and BYOL, we observe\nthat representations of correctly classified samples have few discriminative\nfeatures with highly deviated values compared to other features. This is in a\nclear contrast with representations of misclassified samples.

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful approach to sample-efficient\noptimization of black-box objective functions. However, the application of BO\nto areas such as recommendation systems often requires taking the\ninterpretability and simplicity of the configurations into consideration, a\nsetting that has not been previously studied in the BO literature. To make BO\napplicable in this setting, we present several regularization-based approaches\nthat allow us to discover sparse and more interpretable configurations. We\npropose a novel differentiable relaxation based on homotopy continuation that\nmakes it possible to target sparsity by working directly with $L_0$\nregularization. We identify failure modes for regularized BO and develop a\nhyperparameter-free method, sparsity exploring Bayesian optimization (SEBO)\nthat seeks to simultaneously maximize a target objective and sparsity. SEBO and\nmethods based on fixed regularization are evaluated on synthetic and real-world\nproblems, and we show that we are able to efficiently optimize for sparsity.",

    "abstract": "Wood logs picking is a challenging task to automate. Indeed, logs usually\ncome in cluttered configurations, randomly orientated and overlapping. Recent\nwork on log picking automation usually assume that the logs' pose is known,\nwith little consideration given to the actual perception problem. In this\npaper, we squarely address the latter, using a data-driven approach. First, we\nintroduce a novel dataset, named TimberSeg 1.0, that is densely annotated,\ni.e., that includes both bounding boxes and pixel-level mask annotations for\nlogs. This dataset comprises 220 images with 2500 individually segmented logs.\nUsing our dataset, we then compare three neural network architectures on the\ntask of individual logs detection and segmentation; two region-based methods\nand one attention-based method. Unsurprisingly, our results show that\naxis-aligned proposals, failing to take into account the directional nature of\nlogs, underperform with 19.03 mAP. A rotation-aware proposal method\nsignificantly improve results to 31.83 mAP. More interestingly, a\nTransformer-based approach, without any inductive bias on rotations,\noutperformed the two others, achieving a mAP of 57.53 on our dataset. Our use\ncase demonstrates the limitations of region-based approaches for cluttered,\nelongated objects. It also highlights the potential of attention-based methods\non this specific task, as they work directly at the pixel-level. These\nencouraging results indicate that such a perception system could be used to\nassist the operators on the short-term, or to fully automate log picking\noperations in the future.",

    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) have become effective machine\nlearning algorithms for many downstream network mining tasks such as node\nclassification, link prediction, and community detection. However, most GCN\nmethods have been developed for homogenous networks and are limited to a single\nembedding for each node. Complex systems, often represented by heterogeneous,\nmultiplex networks present a more difficult challenge for GCN models and\nrequire that such techniques capture the diverse contexts and assorted\ninteractions that occur between nodes. In this work, we propose RAHMeN, a novel\nunified relation-aware embedding framework for attributed heterogeneous\nmultiplex networks. Our model incorporates node attributes, motif-based\nfeatures, relation-based GCN approaches, and relational self-attention to learn\nembeddings of nodes with respect to the various relations in a heterogeneous,\nmultiplex network. In contrast to prior work, RAHMeN is a more expressive\nembedding framework that embraces the multi-faceted nature of nodes in such\nnetworks, producing a set of multi-embeddings that capture the varied and\ndiverse contexts of nodes.\nWe evaluate our model on four real-world datasets from Amazon, Twitter,\nYouTube, and Tissue PPIs in both transductive and inductive settings.

    "abstract": "Thin, reflective objects such as forks and whisks are common in our daily\nlives, but they are particularly challenging for robot perception because it is\nhard to reconstruct them using commodity RGB-D cameras or multi-view stereo\ntechniques. While traditional pipelines struggle with objects like these,\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have recently been shown to be remarkably\neffective for performing view synthesis on objects with thin structures or\nreflective materials. In this paper we explore the use of NeRF as a new source\nof supervision for robust robot vision systems. In particular, we demonstrate\nthat a NeRF representation of a scene can be used to train dense object\ndescriptors. We use an optimized NeRF to extract dense correspondences between\nmultiple views of an object, and then use these correspondences as training\ndata for learning a view-invariant representation of the object. NeRF's usage\nof a density field allows us to reformulate the correspondence problem with a\nnovel distribution-of-depths formulation, as opposed to the conventional\napproach of using a depth map. Dense correspondence models supervised with our\nmethod significantly outperform off-the-shelf learned descriptors by 106%\n(PCK@3px metric, more than doubling performance) and outperform our baseline\nsupervised with multi-view stereo by 29%.

Since the release of statistical body models, 3D\nhuman mesh recovery has been drawing broader attention. With the same goal of\nobtaining well-aligned and physically plausible mesh results, two paradigms\nhave been developed to overcome challenges in the 2D-to-3D lifting process: i)\nan optimization-based paradigm, where different data terms and regularization\nterms are exploited as optimization objectives; and ii) a regression-based\nparadigm, where deep learning techniques are embraced to solve the problem in\nan end-to-end fashion. Meanwhile, continuous efforts are devoted to improving\nthe quality of 3D mesh labels for a wide range of datasets. Though remarkable\nprogress has been achieved in the past decade, the task is still challenging\ndue to flexible body motions, diverse appearances, complex environments, and\ninsufficient in-the-wild annotations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst survey to focus on the task of monocular 3D human mesh recovery. We start\nwith the introduction of body models, and then introduce recovery frameworks\nand training objectives by providing in-depth analyses of their strengths and\nweaknesses.

Existing attacks\nrely on having access to either the complete target model (whitebox) or the\nmodel's soft-labels (blackbox). However, no prior work has been done in the\nharder but more practical scenario, in which the attacker only has access to\nthe model's predicted label, without a confidence measure.

The key\nidea of our algorithm is to evaluate the model's predicted labels over a sphere\nand then estimate the direction to reach the target class's centroid. Using the\nexample of face recognition, we show that the images reconstructed by BREP-MI\nsuccessfully reproduce the semantics of the private training data for various\ndatasets and target model architectures.

    "title": "Exploring Smoothness and Class-Separation for Semi-supervised Medical  Image Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Semi-supervised segmentation remains challenging in medical imaging since the\namount of annotated medical data is often limited and there are many blurred\npixels near the adhesive edges or low-contrast regions. To address the issues,\nwe advocate to firstly constrain the consistency of samples with and without\nstrong perturbations to apply sufficient smoothness regularization and further\nencourage the class-level separation to exploit the unlabeled ambiguous pixels\nfor the model training. Particularly, in this paper, we propose the SS-Net for\nsemi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks, via exploring the pixel-level\nSmoothness and inter-class Separation at the same time. The pixel-level\nsmoothness forces the model to generate invariant results under adversarial\nperturbations. Meanwhile, the inter-class separation constrains individual\nclass features should approach their corresponding high-quality prototypes, in\norder to make each class distribution compact and separate different classes.\nWe evaluated our SS-Net against five recent methods on the public LA and ACDC\ndatasets. The experimental results under two semi-supervised settings\ndemonstrate the superiority of our proposed SS-Net, achieving new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both datasets. The codes will be\nreleased.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider two challenging issues in reference-based\nsuper-resolution (RefSR), (i) how to choose a proper reference image, and (ii)\nhow to learn real-world RefSR in a self-supervised manner. Particularly, we\npresent a novel self-supervised learning approach for real-world image SR from\nobservations at dual camera zooms (SelfDZSR). For the first issue, the more\nzoomed (telephoto) image can be naturally leveraged as the reference to guide\nthe SR of the lesser zoomed (short-focus) image. For the second issue, SelfDZSR\nlearns a deep network to obtain the SR result of short-focal image and with the\nsame resolution as the telephoto image. For this purpose, we take the telephoto\nimage instead of an additional high-resolution image as the supervision\ninformation and select a patch from it as the reference to super-resolve the\ncorresponding short-focus image patch. To mitigate the effect of various\nmisalignment between the short-focus low-resolution (LR) image and telephoto\nground-truth (GT) image, we design a degradation model and map the GT to a\npseudo-LR image aligned with GT. Then the pseudo-LR and LR image can be fed\ninto the proposed adaptive spatial transformer networks (AdaSTN) to deform the\nLR features. During testing, SelfDZSR can be directly deployed to super-solve\nthe whole short-focus image with the reference of telephoto image. Experiments\nshow that our method achieves better quantitative and qualitative performance\nagainst state-of-the-arts. The code and pre-trained models will be publicly\navailable.",

Although this is a widespread\nproblem in practice, CATE estimation with missing treatments has received\nlittle attention. In this paper, we analyze CATE estimation in the setting with\nmissing treatments where, thus, unique challenges arise in the form of\ncovariate shifts. We identify two covariate shifts in our setting: (i) a\ncovariate shift between the treated and control population; and (ii) a\ncovariate shift between the observed and missing treatment population. We first\ntheoretically show the effect of these covariate shifts by deriving a\ngeneralization bound for estimating CATE in our setting with missing\ntreatments. Then, motivated by our bound, we develop the missing treatment\nrepresentation network (MTRNet), a novel CATE estimation algorithm that learns\na balanced representation of covariates using domain adaptation. By using\nbalanced representations, MTRNet provides more reliable CATE estimates in the\ncovariate domains where the data are not fully observed.

    "abstract": "Curating a large set of fully annotated training data can be costly,\nespecially for the tasks of medical image segmentation. Scribble, a weaker form\nof annotation, is more obtainable in practice, but training segmentation models\nfrom limited supervision of scribbles is still challenging. To address the\ndifficulties, we propose a new framework for scribble learning-based medical\nimage segmentation, which is composed of mix augmentation and cycle consistency\nand thus is referred to as CycleMix. For augmentation of supervision, CycleMix\nadopts the mixup strategy with a dedicated design of random occlusion, to\nperform increments and decrements of scribbles. For regularization of\nsupervision, CycleMix intensifies the training objective with consistency\nlosses to penalize inconsistent segmentation, which results in significant\nimprovement of segmentation performance. Results on two open datasets, i.e.,\nACDC and MSCMRseg, showed that the proposed method achieved exhilarating\nperformance, demonstrating comparable or even better accuracy than the\nfully-supervised methods. The code and expert-made scribble annotations for\nMSCMRseg will be released once this article is accepted for publication.",

    "abstract": "Quantum information has the property that measurement is an inherently\ndestructive process. This feature is most apparent in the principle of\ncomplementarity, which states that mutually incompatible observables cannot be\nmeasured at the same time. Recent work by Broadbent and Islam (TCC 2020) builds\non this aspect of quantum mechanics to realize a cryptographic notion called\ncertified deletion. While this remarkable notion enables a classical verifier\nto be convinced that a (private-key) quantum ciphertext has been deleted by an\nuntrusted party, it offers no additional layer of functionality.\nIn this work, we augment the proof-of-deletion paradigm with fully\nhomomorphic encryption (FHE). This results in a new and powerful cryptographic\nnotion called fully homomorphic encryption with certified deletion -- an\ninteractive protocol which enables an untrusted quantum server to compute on\nencrypted data and, if requested, to simultaneously prove data deletion to a\nclient. Our main technical ingredient is an interactive protocol by which a\nquantum prover can convince a classical verifier that a sample from the\nLearning with Errors (LWE) distribution in the form of a quantum state was\ndeleted. We introduce an encoding based on Gaussian coset states which is\nhighly generic and suggests that essentially any LWE-based cryptographic\nprimitive admits a classically-verifiable quantum proof of deletion. As an\napplication of our protocol, we construct a Dual-Regev public-key encryption\nscheme with certified deletion, which we then extend towards a (leveled) FHE\nscheme of the same type. Our construction achieves indistinguishable\nciphertexts in the semi-honest adversarial model, even if the secret key is\nlater revealed after deletion has taken place.",

    "abstract": "Current unsupervised anomaly localization approaches rely on generative\nmodels to learn the distribution of normal images, which is later used to\nidentify potential anomalous regions derived from errors on the reconstructed\nimages. However, a main limitation of nearly all prior literature is the need\nof employing anomalous images to set a class-specific threshold to locate the\nanomalies. This limits their usability in realistic scenarios, where only\nnormal data is typically accessible. Despite this major drawback, only a\nhandful of works have addressed this limitation, by integrating supervision on\nattention maps during training. In this work, we propose a novel formulation\nthat does not require accessing images with abnormalities to define the\nthreshold. Furthermore, and in contrast to very recent work, the proposed\nconstraint is formulated in a more principled manner, leveraging well-known\nknowledge in constrained optimization. In particular, the equality constraint\non the attention maps in prior work is replaced by an inequality constraint,\nwhich allows more flexibility. In addition, to address the limitations of\npenalty-based functions we employ an extension of the popular log-barrier\nmethods to handle the constraint. Last, we propose an alternative\nregularization term that maximizes the Shannon entropy of the attention maps,\nreducing the amount of hyperparameters of the proposed model.

    "abstract": "We consider reinforcement learning (RL) methods in offline nonstationary\nenvironments. Many existing RL algorithms in the literature rely on the\nstationarity assumption that requires the system transition and the reward\nfunction to be constant over time. However, the stationarity assumption is\nrestrictive in practice and is likely to be violated in a number of\napplications, including traffic signal control, robotics and mobile health. In\nthis paper, we develop a consistent procedure to test the nonstationarity of\nthe optimal policy based on pre-collected historical data, without additional\nonline data collection. Based on the proposed test, we further develop a\nsequential change point detection method that can be naturally coupled with\nexisting state-of-the-art RL methods for policy optimisation in nonstationary\nenvironments. The usefulness of our method is illustrated by theoretical\nresults, simulation studies, and a real data example from the 2018 Intern\nHealth Study. A Python implementation of the proposed procedure is available at\nhttps://github.com/limengbinggz/CUSUM-RL",

Another difficulty is the characterisation of the\nfluid-limit which involves the stationary probabilities of a certain\nmulti-dimensional Markov chain.

However, the axiom gives only a local characterization of the\nrelation of bases, which is a major stumbling block to further progress, and\nproviding a global understanding of the structure of matroid bases is a\nfundamental goal in matroid optimization.\nWhile studying the structure of symmetric exchanges, Gabow proposed the\nproblem that any pair of bases admits a sequence of symmetric exchanges. A\ndifferent extension of the exchange axiom was proposed by White, who\ninvestigated the equivalence of compatible basis sequences. Farber studied the\nstructure of basis pairs, and conjectured that the basis pair graph of any\nmatroid is connected. These conjectures suggest that the family of bases of a\nmatroid possesses much stronger structural properties than we are aware of.\nIn the present paper, we study the distance of basis pairs of a matroid in\nterms of symmetric exchanges. In particular, we give an upper bound on the\nminimum number of exchanges needed to transform a basis pair into another for\nsplit matroids, a class that was motivated by the study of matroid polytopes\nfrom a tropical geometry point of view.

To deal with the data scarcity problem, data augmentation\nis commonly used for model pretraining. In this paper, we propose a phone-level\nmixup, a simple yet effective data augmentation method, to improve the\nperformance of word-level pronunciation scoring. Specifically, given a phoneme\nsequence from lexicon, the artificial augmented word sample can be generated by\nrandomly sampling from the corresponding phone-level features in training data,\nwhile the word score is the average of their GOP scores. Benefit from the\narbitrary phone-level combination, the mixup is able to generate any word with\nvarious pronunciation scores. Moreover, we utilize multi-source information\n(e.g., MFCC and deep features) to further improve the scoring system\nperformance. The experiments conducted on the Speechocean762 show that the\nproposed system outperforms the baseline by adding the mixup data for\npretraining, with Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) increasing from 0.567\nto 0.61. The results also indicate that proposed method achieves similar\nperformance by using 1/10 unlabeled data of baseline.

This limits our\nability to know when algorithms for improving calibration have a real effect,\nand when their improvements are merely artifacts due to random noise in finite\ndatasets. In this work, we consider detecting mis-calibration of predictive\nmodels using a finite validation dataset as a hypothesis testing problem. The\nnull hypothesis is that the predictive model is calibrated, while the\nalternative hypothesis is that the deviation from calibration is sufficiently\nlarge.\nWe find that detecting mis-calibration is only possible when the conditional\nprobabilities of the classes are sufficiently smooth functions of the\npredictions.

A recent study demonstrated that humans\nperceive visual stimuli differently depending on whether they do the task by\nthemselves or together with a robot. Specifically, it was found that the\ncentral tendency effect is stronger in social than in non-social task settings.\nThe particular nature of such behavioral changes induced by social interaction,\nand their underlying cognitive processes in the human brain are, however, still\nnot well understood. In this paper, we address this question by training an\nartificial neural network inspired by the predictive coding theory on the above\nbehavioral data set. Using this computational model, we investigate whether the\nchange in behavior that was caused by the situational context in the human\nexperiment could be explained by continuous modifications of a parameter\nexpressing how strongly sensory and prior information affect perception. We\ndemonstrate that it is possible to replicate human behavioral data in both\nindividual and social task settings by modifying the precision of prior and\nsensory signals, indicating that social and non-social task settings might in\nfact exist on a continuum. At the same time an analysis of the neural\nactivation traces of the trained networks provides evidence that information is\ncoded in fundamentally different ways in the network in the individual and in\nthe social conditions.

Our approach first infers the cell edges,\nthen selects the cells that are well detected, and finally applies a\npostprocessing method to correct mistakes and provide the binary segmentation\nfrom which the corneal parameters are estimated (cell density [ECD],\ncoefficient of variation [CV], and hexagonality [HEX]). In this study, we\nanalyzed 1203 images acquired with a Topcon SP-1P microscope, 500 of which\ncontained guttae. Manual segmentation was performed in all images. We compared\nthe results of different networks (UNet, ResUNeXt, DenseUNets, UNet++) and\nfound that DenseUNets with fNLA provided the best performance, with a mean\nabsolute error of 23.16 [cells/mm$^{2}$] in ECD, 1.28 [%] in CV, and 3.13 [%]\nin HEX, which was 3-6 times smaller than the error obtained by Topcon's\nbuilt-in software. Our approach handled the cells affected by guttae remarkably\nwell, detecting cell edges occluded by small guttae while discarding areas\ncovered by large guttae. fNLA made use of the local information, providing\nsharper edges in guttae areas and better results in the selection of\nwell-detected cells.

    "title": "ROCT-Net: A new ensemble deep convolutional model with improved spatial  resolution learning for detecting common diseases from retinal OCT images",
    "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging is a well-known technology for\nvisualizing retinal layers and helps ophthalmologists to detect possible\ndiseases. Accurate and early diagnosis of common retinal diseases can prevent\nthe patients from suffering critical damages to their vision. Computer-aided\ndiagnosis (CAD) systems can significantly assist ophthalmologists in improving\ntheir examinations. This paper presents a new enhanced deep ensemble\nconvolutional neural network for detecting retinal diseases from OCT images.\nOur model generates rich and multi-resolution features by employing the\nlearning architectures of two robust convolutional models. Spatial resolution\nis a critical factor in medical images, especially the OCT images that contain\ntiny essential points. To empower our model, we apply a new post-architecture\nmodel to our ensemble model for enhancing spatial resolution learning without\nincreasing computational costs. The introduced post-architecture model can be\ndeployed to any feature extraction model to improve the utilization of the\nfeature map's spatial values. We have collected two open-source datasets for\nour experiments to make our models capable of detecting six crucial retinal\ndiseases: Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Central Serous Retinopathy\n(CSR), Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), Diabetic\nMacular Edema (DME), and Drusen alongside the normal cases. Our experiments on\ntwo datasets and comparing our model with some other well-known deep\nconvolutional neural networks have proven that our architecture can increase\nthe classification accuracy up to 5%. We hope that our proposed methods create\nthe next step of CAD systems development and help future researches. The code\nof this paper is shared at https://github.com/mr7495/OCT-classification.",

    "abstract": "We present a new data structure for representation of polynomial variables in\nthe parsing of sum-of-squares (SOS) programs. In SOS programs, the variables\n$s(x;P)$ are polynomial in the independent variables $x$, but linear in the\ndecision variables $P$. Current SOS parsers, however, fail to exploit the\nsemi-linear structure of the polynomial variables, treating the decision\nvariables as independent variables in their representation. This results in\nunnecessary overhead in storage and manipulation of the polynomial variables,\nprohibiting the parser from addressing larger-scale optimization problems. To\neliminate this computational overhead, we introduce a new representation of\npolynomial variables, the \"dpvar\" structure, that is affine in the decision\nvariables. We show that the complexity of operations on variables in the dpvar\nrepresentation scales favorably with the number of decision variables. We\nfurther show that the required memory for storing polynomial variables is\nrelatively small using the dpvar structure, particularly when exploiting the\nMATLAB sparse storage structure. Finally, we incorporate the dpvar data\nstructure into SOSTOOLS 4.00, and test the performance of the parser for\nseveral polynomial optimization problems.",

    "abstract": "Multiple objective assessment of image-quality-based studies have reported\nthat several deep-learning-based denoising methods show limited performance on\nsignal-detection tasks. Our goal was to investigate the reasons for this\nlimited performance. To achieve this goal, we conducted a task-based\ncharacterization of a DL-based denoising approach for individual signal\nproperties. We conducted this study in the context of evaluating a DL-based\napproach for denoising SPECT images. The training data consisted of signals of\ndifferent sizes and shapes within a clustered-lumpy background, imaged with a\n2D parallel-hole-collimator SPECT system. The projections were generated at\nnormal and 20% low count level, both of which were reconstructed using an OSEM\nalgorithm. A CNN-based denoiser was trained to process the low-count images.\nThe performance of this CNN was characterized for five different signal sizes\nand four different SBR by designing each evaluation as an SKE/BKS\nsignal-detection task. Performance on this task was evaluated using an\nanthropomorphic CHO. As in previous studies, we observed that the DL-based\ndenoising method did not improve performance on signal-detection tasks.\nEvaluation using the idea of observer-study-based characterization demonstrated\nthat the DL-based denoising approach did not improve performance on the\nsignal-detection task for any of the signal types. Overall, these results\nprovide new insights on the performance of the DL-based denoising approach as a\nfunction of signal size and contrast. More generally, the observer study-based\ncharacterization provides a mechanism to evaluate the sensitivity of the method\nto specific object properties and may be explored as analogous to\ncharacterizations such as modulation transfer function for linear systems.\nFinally, this work underscores the need for objective task-based evaluation of\nDL-based denoising approaches.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is the only non-invasive technique sensitive to tissue\nmicro-architecture, which can, in turn, be used to reconstruct tissue\nmicrostructure and white matter pathways. The accuracy of such tasks is\nhampered by the low signal-to-noise ratio in dMRI. Today, the noise is\ncharacterized mainly by visual inspection of residual maps and estimated\nstandard deviation. However, it is hard to estimate the impact of noise on\ndownstream tasks based only on such qualitative assessments. To address this\nissue, we introduce a novel metric, Noise Uncertainty Quantification (NUQ), for\nquantitative image quality analysis in the absence of a ground truth reference\nimage. NUQ uses a recent Bayesian formulation of dMRI models to estimate the\nuncertainty of microstructural measures. Specifically, NUQ uses the maximum\nmean discrepancy metric to compute a pooled quality score by comparing samples\ndrawn from the posterior distribution of the microstructure measures. We show\nthat NUQ allows a fine-grained analysis of noise, capturing details that are\nvisually imperceptible. We perform qualitative and quantitative comparisons on\nreal datasets, showing that NUQ generates consistent scores across different\ndenoisers and acquisitions. Lastly, by using NUQ on a cohort of schizophrenics\nand controls, we quantify the substantial impact of denoising on group\ndifferences.",
