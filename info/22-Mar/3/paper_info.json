    "abstract": "Hyper-partisan misinformation has become a major public concern. In order to\nexamine what type of misinformation label can mitigate hyper-partisan\nmisinformation sharing on social media, we conducted a 4 (label type:\nalgorithm, community, third-party fact-checker, and no label) X 2 (post\nideology: liberal vs. conservative) between-subjects online experiment (N =\n1,677) in the context of COVID-19 health information. The results suggest that\nfor liberal users, all labels reduced the perceived accuracy and believability\nof fake posts regardless of the posts' ideology. In contrast, for conservative\nusers, the efficacy of the labels depended on whether the posts were\nideologically consistent: algorithmic labels were more effective in reducing\nthe perceived accuracy and believability of fake conservative posts compared to\ncommunity labels, whereas all labels were effective in reducing their belief in\nliberal posts. Our results shed light on the differing effects of various\nmisinformation labels dependent on people's political ideology.",

    "title": "Subspace-Based Pilot Decontamination in User-Centric Scalable Cell-Free  Wireless Networks",
    "abstract": "We consider a cell-free wireless system operated in Time Division Duplex\n(TDD) mode with localized user-centric clusters of remote radio units (RUs).\nSince the uplink pilot dimensions per channel coherence slot is limited,\nco-pilot users might incur mutual pilot contamination. In the current\nliterature, it is assumed that the long-term statistical knowledge of all user\nchannels is available. This enables MMSE channel estimation or simplified\ndominant subspace projection, which achieves significant pilot decontamination\nunder certain assumptions on the channel covariance matrices. However,\nestimating the channel covariance matrix or even just its dominant subspace at\nall RUs forming a user cluster is not an easy task. In fact, if not properly\ndesigned, a piloting scheme for such long-term statistics estimation will also\nbe subject to the contamination problem. In this paper, we propose a new\nchannel subspace estimation scheme explicitly designed for cell-free wireless\nnetworks. Our scheme is based on 1) a sounding reference signal (SRS) using\nlatin squares wideband frequency hopping, and 2) a subspace estimation method\nbased on robust Principal Component Analysis (R-PCA). The SRS hopping scheme\nensures that for any user and any RU participating in its cluster, only a few\npilot measurements will contain strong co-pilot interference. These few heavily\ncontaminated measurements are (implicitly) eliminated by R-PCA, which is\ndesigned to regularize the estimation and discount the \"outlier\" measurements.\nOur simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves almost perfect\nsubspace knowledge, which in turns yields system performance very close to that\nwith ideal channel state information, thus essentially solving the problem of\npilot contamination in cell-free user-centric TDD wireless networks.",

    "abstract": "Due to hemiparesis, stroke survivors frequently develop a dysfunctional gait\nthat is often characterized by an overall decrease in walking speed and a\nunilateral decrease in step length. With millions currently affected by this\ndysfunctional gait, robust and effective rehabilitation protocols are needed.\nAlthough robotic devices have been used in numerous rehabilitation protocols\nfor gait, the lack of significant aftereffects that translate to effective\ntherapy makes their application still questionable. This paper proposes a novel\ntype of robot-assisted intervention that results in significant aftereffects\nthat last much longer than any other previous study. With the utilization of a\nnovel robotic device, the Variable Stiffness Treadmill (VST), the stiffness of\nthe walking surface underneath one leg is decreased for a number of steps. This\nunilateral stiffness perturbation results in a significant aftereffect that is\nboth useful for stroke rehabilitation and often lasts for over 200 gait cycles\nafter the intervention has concluded. More specifically, the aftereffect\ncreated is an increase in both left and right step lengths, with the\nunperturbed step length increasing significantly more than the perturbed. These\neffects may be helpful in correcting two of the most common issues in\npost-stroke gait: overall decrease in walking speed and a unilateral shortened\nstep length. The results of this work show that a robot-assisted therapy\nprotocol involving repeated unilateral stiffness perturbations can lead to a\nmore permanent and effective solution to post-stroke gait.",

    "abstract": "In this work we propose a novel solution for 3D skeleton-based human motion\nprediction. The objective of this task consists in forecasting future human\nposes based on a prior skeleton pose sequence. This involves solving two main\nchallenges still present in recent literature; (1) discontinuity of the\npredicted motion which results in unrealistic motions and (2) performance\ndeterioration in long-term horizons resulting from error accumulation across\ntime. We tackle these issues by using a compact manifold-valued representation\nof 3D human skeleton motion. Specifically, we model the temporal evolution of\nthe 3D poses as trajectory, what allows us to map human motions to single\npoints on a sphere manifold. Using such a compact representation avoids error\naccumulation and provides robust representation for long-term prediction while\nensuring the smoothness and the coherence of the whole motion. To learn these\nnon-Euclidean representations, we build a manifold-aware Wasserstein generative\nadversarial model that captures the temporal and spatial dependencies of human\nmotion through different losses. Experiments have been conducted on CMU MoCap\nand Human 3.6M datasets and demonstrate the superiority of our approach over\nthe state-of-the-art both in short and long term horizons.

    "abstract": "Maintaining energy balance and economical operation is significant for\nmulti-energy systems such as the energy hub. However, it is usually challenged\nby the frequently changing and unpredictable uncertainties at different\ntimescales. Under this scope, this paper investigates the coordinated energy\nmanagement problem for day-ahead and intra-day conditions considering\nuncertainties of source-load and market prices concurrently. Note that the\nprecise knowledge of distributions about uncertainties may be unaccessible\nbefore the decision-making in day-ahead phase. A two-stage chance-constrained\nmodel based on distributionally robust approach with ambiguous moment\ninformation is proposed to immunize scheduling strategies against the\nworst-case probability distributions. The first stage is dedicated to obtaining\nmore energy arbitrage and operation flexibility by optimizing bidding\nstrategies in day-ahead power, natural gas and carbon markets. The second stage\nfocuses on the optimization of worst-case expected operation cost. It provides\na robust energy equipment and load scheduling strategy for the reference of\nsubsequent intra-day arrangements. With respect to different variations of\nelectrical and thermal components, an intra-day two-timescale coordination is\nimplemented step by step. The energy scheduling is re-dispatched circularly to\nminimize the operation and penalty costs. The possible energy imbalance is also\ncompensated by this way. As the energy management program is nonlinear,\nchance-constrained and multi-stage, linearization and dual transformation\ntechniques are designed to enhance tractability of programs. Experimental\nresults show that the developed multi-level framework results in a carbon\nemission decrease of 37%, and reduces energy cost averagely 3% compared with\ncorresponding contrasting cases. The obtained strategy validates a good\ntradeoff between robustness and optimality.",

    "abstract": "Building huge and highly capable language models has been a trend in the past\nyears. Despite their great performance, they incur high computational cost. A\ncommon solution is to apply model compression or choose light-weight\narchitectures, which often need a separate fixed-size model for each desirable\ncomputational budget, and may lose performance in case of heavy compression.\nThis paper proposes an effective dynamic inference approach, called E-LANG,\nwhich distributes the inference between large accurate Super-models and\nlight-weight Swift models. To this end, a decision making module routes the\ninputs to Super or Swift models based on the energy characteristics of the\nrepresentations in the latent space. This method is easily adoptable and\narchitecture agnostic. As such, it can be applied to black-box pre-trained\nmodels without a need for architectural manipulations, reassembling of modules,\nor re-training. Unlike existing methods that are only applicable to\nencoder-only backbones and classification tasks, our method also works for\nencoder-decoder structures and sequence-to-sequence tasks such as translation.\nThe E-LANG performance is verified through a set of experiments with T5 and\nBERT backbones on GLUE, SuperGLUE, and WMT. In particular, we outperform T5-11B\nwith an average computations speed-up of 3.3$\\times$ on GLUE and 2.9$\\times$ on\nSuperGLUE.

We present an\napproach in which devices that include both electrical and deformable\ncomponents can be created in a single print on a multi-material 3D printer,\nrequiring no assembly. Designers can customize devices including the input\ntype, travel distance and layout of keys, textures of surfaces, and route all\nelectrical signals directly to a microcontroller socket. In many instances,\nthese devices require no support material, producing a functional device the\nmoment a print finishes. We demonstrate this approach by creating a customized\nkeyboard and report on validation measurements of individual input keys as well\nas highlighting additional designs. This work provides the first step towards\nlowering the barrier to entry for non-engineers to design custom tactile\ninputs, enabling occupational and physical therapists, clinicians, and\neducators to design and create devices directly based on their assessments of\nindividual user needs.",

    "abstract": "Images are often more significant than only the pixels to human eyes, as we\ncan infer, associate, and reason with contextual information from other sources\nto establish a more complete picture. For example, in Figure 1, we can find a\nway to identify the news articles related to the picture through segment-wise\nunderstandings on the signs, the buildings, the crowds, and more. This tells us\nthe time when and the location where the image is taken, which will help us in\nsubsequent tasks, such as evidence retrieval for criminal activities, automatic\nstoryline construction, and upper-stream processing such as image clustering.\nIn this work, we formulate this problem and introduce TARA: a dataset with 16k\nimages with their associated news, time and location automatically extracted\nfrom New York Times (NYT), and an additional 61k examples as distant\nsupervision from WIT. On top of the extractions, we present a crowdsourced\nsubset in which images are believed to be feasible to find their\nspatio-temporal information for evaluation purpose. We show that there exists a\n70% gap between a state-of-the-art joint model and human performance, which is\nslightly filled by our proposed model that uses segment-wise reasoning,\nmotivating higher-level vision-language joint models that can conduct\nopen-ended reasoning with world knowledge.",

Ethereum Smart Contracts are programs that are deployed as\ndecentralized applications, having the building blocks of the blockchain\nconsensus protocol.

However, there exist some security\nvulnerabilities within these smart contracts that are a potential threat to the\napplications and their consumers and have shown in the past to cause huge\nfinancial losses. This paper presents a framework and empirical analysis that\nuse code clone detection techniques for identifying vulnerabilities and their\nvariations in smart contracts. Our empirical analysis is conducted using the\nNicad code clone detection tool on a dataset of approximately 50k Ethereum\nsmart contracts. We evaluated VOLCANO on two datasets, one with confirmed\nvulnerabilities and another with approximately 50k random smart contracts\ncollected from the Etherscan. Our approach shows an improvement in the\ndetection of vulnerabilities in terms of coverage and efficiency when compared\nto two of the publicly available static analyzers to detect vulnerabilities in\nsmart contracts.

Consequently, it is likely that the observed data distribution upon\ndeployment is a subset of the training data distribution. In such cases, not\nadapting a network to the observed data distribution can cause performance\ndegradation due to negative transfer and alleviating this is the focus of\nPartial Domain Adaptation (PDA). Current works targeting PDA do not focus on\nperforming the domain adaptation on an edge device, adapting to a changing\ntarget distribution or reducing the cost of deploying the adapted network. This\nwork proposes a novel PDA methodology that targets all of these directions and\nopens avenues for on-device PDA. LoCO-PDA adapts a deployed network to the\nobserved data distribution by enabling it to be retrained on an edge device.\nAcross subsets of the ILSVRC12 dataset, LoCO-PDA improves classification\naccuracy by 3.04pp on average while achieving up to 15.1x reduction in\nretraining memory consumption and 2.07x improvement in inference latency on the\nNVIDIA Jetson TX2.

In\nour companion paper, we introduced Distributed and Localized Model Predictive\nControl (DLMPC) for large-scale linear systems; DLMPC is a scalable closed-loop\nMPC scheme in which subsystems need only exchange local information in order to\nsynthesize and implement local controllers. In this paper, we provide recursive\nfeasibility and asymptotic stability guarantees for DLMPC. We leverage the\nSystem Level Synthesis framework to express the maximal positive robust\ninvariant set for the closed-loop system and its corresponding Lyapunov\nfunction, both in terms of the closed-loop system responses. We use the\ninvariant set as the terminal set for DLMPC, and show that this guarantees\nfeasibility with minimal conservatism. We use the Lyapunov function as the\nterminal cost, and show that this guarantees stability. We provide fully\ndistributed and localized algorithms to compute the terminal set offline, and\nalso provide necessary additions to the online DLMPC algorithm to accommodate\ncoupled terminal constraint and cost. In all algorithms, only local information\nexchanges are necessary, and computational complexity is independent of the\nglobal system size -- we demonstrate this analytically and experimentally.

Moreover, we propose a reliable and efficient a posteriori error\nestimator for our spectral problem. We report numerical tests in different\ndomains, computing the spectrum and convergence orders, together with a\ncomputational analysis for the proposed estimator. In addition, we use the\ncorresponding error estimator to drive an adaptive scheme, and we report the\nresults of a numerical test, that allow us to assess the performance of this\napproach.",

    "abstract": "With increasing physical threats in recent years targeted at critical\ninfrastructures, it is crucial to establish a reliable threat monitoring system\nintegrating video surveillance and digital sensors based on cutting-edge\ntechnologies. A physical threat monitoring solution unifying the floorplan,\ncameras, and sensors for smart buildings has been set up in our study. Computer\nvision and deep learning models are used for video streams analysis. When a\nthreat is detected by a rule engine based on the real-time analysis results\ncombining with feedback from related digital sensors, an alert is sent to the\nVideo Management System so that human operators can take further action. A\nphysical threat monitoring system typically needs to address complex and even\ndestructive incidents, such as fire, which is unrealistic to simulate in real\nlife. Restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic and privacy concerns\nhave added to the challenges. Our study utilises the Unreal Engine to simulate\nsome typical suspicious and intrusion scenes with photorealistic qualities in\nthe context of a virtual building. Add-on programs are implemented to transfer\nthe video stream from virtual PTZ cameras to the Milestone Video Management\nSystem and enable users to control those cameras from the graphic client\napplication. Virtual sensors such as fire alarms, temperature sensors and door\naccess controls are implemented similarly, fulfilling the same programmatic VMS\ninterface as real-life sensors. Thanks to this simulation system's\nextensibility and repeatability, we have consolidated this unified physical\nthreat monitoring system and verified its effectiveness and user-friendliness.\nBoth the simulated Unreal scenes and the software add-ons developed during this\nstudy are highly modulated and thereby are ready for reuse in future projects\nin this area.",

We have identified\nfour main problems related to preserving the privacy of users of fitness apps:\nlack of system transparency, lack of privacy policy legibility, concerns\nregarding one-time consent, and issues of noncompliance regarding consent\nmanagement.

Existing work formalizes the task as matching between the utterances\nand a candidate and uses the cross-entropy loss in learning of the model. This\npaper applies contrastive learning to the problem by using the supervised\ncontrastive loss. In this way, the learned representations of positive examples\nand representations of negative examples can be more distantly separated in the\nembedding space, and the performance of matching can be enhanced. We further\ndevelop a new method for supervised contrastive learning, referred to as\ntwo-level supervised contrastive learning, and employ the method in response\nselection in multi-turn dialogue. Our method exploits two techniques: sentence\ntoken shuffling (STS) and sentence re-ordering (SR) for supervised contrastive\nlearning. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed method significantly outperforms the contrastive learning baseline and\nthe state-of-the-art methods for the task.",

Undocking without\nadditional actuation is achieved by causing intentional self-collision between\nthe tails of neighboring modules; this becomes a challenge when group swimming\nas one connected component is desirable. In this work, we develop a control\nstrategy to allow parallel lattices of Modboats to swim as a single unit, which\nconventionally requires holonomic modules. We show that the control strategy is\nguaranteed to avoid unintentional undocking and minimizes internal forces\nwithin the lattice. Experimental verification shows that the controller\nperforms well and is consistent for lattices of various sizes.

Second, we\nsummarized five code smells in DL systems.

With the advent of deep learning, deep neural networks have\nsignificant potential to outperform existing state-of-the-art, model-based\nmethods for solving inverse problems. However, it is known that current\ndata-driven approaches face several key issues, notably instabilities and\nhallucinations, with potential impact in critical tasks such as medical\nimaging. This raises the key question of whether or not one can construct\nstable and accurate deep neural networks for inverse problems. In this work, we\npresent a novel construction of an accurate, stable and efficient neural\nnetwork for inverse problems with general analysis-sparse models. To construct\nthe network, we unroll NESTA, an accelerated first-order method for convex\noptimization. Combined with a compressed sensing analysis, we prove accuracy\nand stability. Finally, a restart scheme is employed to enable exponential\ndecay of the required network depth, yielding a shallower, and consequently\nmore efficient, network. We showcase this approach in the case of Fourier\nimaging, and verify its stability and performance via a series of numerical\nexperiments.

Running batch algorithms is\ninfeasible in such scenarios as it would incur a significant overhead if\nperformed continuously.

Nevertheless, in\nMulti-Access Edge Computing (MEC), as the edge has limited resources compared\nto the cloud, on-demand users may not get their jobs served on time, or at all,\nif too many resources were reserved by reservation plan users. Concurrently,\nreservation plan users may possess excess un-utilized quota. To optimize this\nresource mismatch scenario, we propose a Sharing Quota Model (SQM) where\nreservation plan users can re-sell unused resource quota to on-demand users,\nwith the mobile network operator (MNO) taking a commission. To analyze the\nuser's aggregate behavior at equilibrium and investigate the MNO's incentive of\nallowing re-selling, we formulate a 3-stage non-cooperative Stackelberg Game.\nSolving this game, we characterize the optimal strategies of buyers and\nre-sellers. We show that on aggregate, users' optimal strategies give rise to 4\ndisjoint regions, dependent on the MNO's prices and supply levels. Based on\nthis, we characterise the MNO's optimal prices for on-demand users. Numerical\nresults show that having both the sharing and on-demand pool gives the MNO an\noptimal revenue when the on-demand pool's supply is low, and when the MNO's\ncommission is low.",

    "abstract": "An increasing focus on the electricity use and carbon emissions associated\nwith computing has lead to pledges by major cloud computing companies to lower\ntheir carbon footprint. Data centers have a unique ability to shift computing\nload between different geographical locations, giving rise to geographic load\nflexibility that can be employed to reduce carbon emissions. In this paper, we\npresent a model where data centers shift load independently of the ISOs. We\nfirst consider the impact of load shifting guided by locational marginal carbon\nemissions, denoted by $\\lambda_{\\text{CO}_2}$, a sensitivity metric that\nmeasures the impact of incremental load shifts. Relative to previous models for\ndata center load shifting, the presented model improves accuracy and include\nmore realistic assumptions regarding the operation of both data centers and the\nelectricity market. Further, we introduce a new benchmark model in which data\ncenters have access to the full information about the power system and can\nidentify optimal shifts for the current time period. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of our model on the IEEE RTS GMLC system using 5 minute load and\ngeneration data for an entire year. Our results show that the proposed accuracy\nimprovements for the shifting model based on $\\lambda_{\\text{CO}_2}$ are highly\neffective, leading to results that outperform the benchmark model.",

Lately, 3D\nTransformers have been adopted to improve point cloud processing. Nevertheless,\nmassive Transformer layers tend to incur huge computational and memory costs.\nThis paper presents a novel hierarchical framework that incorporates\nconvolution with Transformer for point cloud classification, named 3D\nConvolution-Transformer Network (3DCTN), to combine the strong and efficient\nlocal feature learning ability of convolution with the remarkable global\ncontext modeling capability of Transformer. Our method has two main modules\noperating on the downsampling point sets, and each module consists of a\nmulti-scale local feature aggregating (LFA) block and a global feature learning\n(GFL) block, which are implemented by using Graph Convolution and Transformer\nrespectively. We also conduct a detailed investigation on a series of\nTransformer variants to explore better performance for our network.

We propose using a\nlatent-variable state-space modeling framework for driver state analysis.

Through using a case study of multimodal driving data\ncollected from 11 participants, we first estimate the latent stress level and\nworkload of drivers from their heart rate, gaze measures, and intensity of\nfacial action units. We then show that external contextual elements such as the\nnumber of vehicles as a proxy for traffic density and secondary task demands\nmay be associated with changes in driver's stress levels and workload.

    "abstract": "A well-known challenge in applying deep-learning methods to omnidirectional\nimages is spherical distortion. In dense regression tasks such as depth\nestimation, where structural details are required, using a vanilla CNN layer on\nthe distorted 360 image results in undesired information loss. In this paper,\nwe propose a 360 monocular depth estimation pipeline, \\textit{OmniFusion}, to\ntackle the spherical distortion issue. Our pipeline transforms a 360 image into\nless-distorted perspective patches (i.e. tangent images) to obtain patch-wise\npredictions via CNN, and then merge the patch-wise results for final output. To\nhandle the discrepancy between patch-wise predictions which is a major issue\naffecting the merging quality, we propose a new framework with the following\nkey components. First, we propose a geometry-aware feature fusion mechanism\nthat combines 3D geometric features with 2D image features to compensate for\nthe patch-wise discrepancy. Second, we employ the self-attention-based\ntransformer architecture to conduct a global aggregation of patch-wise\ninformation, which further improves the consistency. Last, we introduce an\niterative depth refinement mechanism, to further refine the estimated depth\nbased on the more accurate geometric features. Experiments show that our method\ngreatly mitigates the distortion issue, and achieves state-of-the-art\nperformances on several 360 monocular depth estimation benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "3D dense captioning aims to describe individual objects by natural language\nin 3D scenes, where 3D scenes are usually represented as RGB-D scans or point\nclouds. However, only exploiting single modal information, e.g., point cloud,\nprevious approaches fail to produce faithful descriptions. Though aggregating\n2D features into point clouds may be beneficial, it introduces an extra\ncomputational burden, especially in inference phases. In this study, we\ninvestigate a cross-modal knowledge transfer using Transformer for 3D dense\ncaptioning, X-Trans2Cap, to effectively boost the performance of single-modal\n3D caption through knowledge distillation using a teacher-student framework. In\npractice, during the training phase, the teacher network exploits auxiliary 2D\nmodality and guides the student network that only takes point clouds as input\nthrough the feature consistency constraints. Owing to the well-designed\ncross-modal feature fusion module and the feature alignment in the training\nphase, X-Trans2Cap acquires rich appearance information embedded in 2D images\nwith ease. Thus, a more faithful caption can be generated only using point\nclouds during the inference. Qualitative and quantitative results confirm that\nX-Trans2Cap outperforms previous state-of-the-art by a large margin, i.e.,\nabout +21 and about +16 absolute CIDEr score on ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new challenging task namely IDentity Stylization (IDS) across\nheterogeneous domains. IDS focuses on stylizing the content identity, rather\nthan completely swapping it using the reference identity. We use an effective\nheterogeneous-network-based framework $Styleverse$ that uses a single\ndomain-aware generator to exploit the Metaverse of diverse heterogeneous faces,\nbased on the proposed dataset FS13 with limited data. FS13 means 13 kinds of\nFace Styles considering diverse lighting conditions, art representations and\nlife dimensions. Previous similar tasks, \\eg, image style transfer can handle\ntextural style transfer based on a reference image. This task usually ignores\nthe high structure-aware facial area and high-fidelity preservation of the\ncontent. However, Styleverse intends to controllably create topology-aware\nfaces in the Parallel Style Universe, where the source facial identity is\nadaptively styled via AdaIN guided by the domain-aware and reference-aware\nstyle embeddings from heterogeneous pretrained models. We first establish the\nIDS quantitative benchmark as well as the qualitative Styleverse matrix.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Styleverse achieves higher-fidelity\nidentity stylization compared with other state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Image inpainting has made significant advances in recent years. However, it\nis still challenging to recover corrupted images with both vivid textures and\nreasonable structures. Some specific methods only tackle regular textures while\nlosing holistic structures due to the limited receptive fields of convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs). On the other hand, attention-based models can learn\nbetter long-range dependency for the structure recovery, but they are limited\nby the heavy computation for inference with large image sizes. To address these\nissues, we propose to leverage an additional structure restorer to facilitate\nthe image inpainting incrementally. The proposed model restores holistic image\nstructures with a powerful attention-based transformer model in a fixed\nlow-resolution sketch space. Such a grayscale space is easy to be upsampled to\nlarger scales to convey correct structural information. Our structure restorer\ncan be integrated with other pretrained inpainting models efficiently with the\nzero-initialized residual addition. Furthermore, a masking positional encoding\nstrategy is utilized to improve the performance with large irregular masks.\nExtensive experiments on various datasets validate the efficacy of our model\ncompared with other competitors.

This in part can be\nattributed to the creation of infeasible regions generated by the constraint\nfunctions, and/or the interaction between constraints and objectives. In this\npaper, we explore the relationship between constrained multi-objective\nevolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) performance and CMOP instances characteristics\nusing Instance Space Analysis (ISA). To do this, we extend recent work focused\non the use of Landscape Analysis features to characterise CMOP. Specifically,\nwe scrutinise the multi-objective landscape and introduce new features to\ndescribe the multi-objective-violation landscape, formed by the interaction\nbetween constraint violation and multi-objective fitness. Detailed evaluation\nof problem-algorithm footprints spanning six CMOP benchmark suites and fifteen\nCMOEAs, illustrates that ISA can effectively capture the strength and weakness\nof the CMOEAs. We conclude that two key characteristics, the isolation of\nnon-dominate set and the correlation between constraints and objectives\nevolvability, have the greatest impact on algorithm performance. However, the\ncurrent benchmarks problems do not provide enough diversity to fully reveal the\nefficacy of CMOEAs evaluated.",

It aims to discover object instances in real pictures from a\nhuge number of established categories. In recent years, deep learning-based\nobject detection techniques that developed from computer vision have grabbed\nthe public's interest. Object recognition methods based on deep learning\nframeworks have quickly become a popular way to interpret moving images\nacquired by various sensors. Due to its vast variety of applications for\nvarious computer vision tasks such as activity or event detection,\ncontent-based image retrieval, and scene understanding, academics have spent\ndecades attempting to solve this problem. With this goal in mind, a unique deep\nlearning classification technique is used to create an autonomous object\ndetecting system. The noise destruction and normalising operations, which are\ncarried out using gaussian filter and contrast normalisation techniques,\nrespectively, are the first steps in the study activity. The pre-processed\npicture is next subjected to entropy-based segmentation algorithms, which\nseparate the image's significant areas in order to distinguish between distinct\noccurrences. The classification challenge is completed by the suggested Hybrid\nOptimized Dense Convolutional Neural Network (HODCNN). The major goal of this\nframework is to aid in the precise recognition of distinct items from the\ngathered input frames. The suggested system's performance is assessed by\ncomparing it to existing machine learning and deep learning methodologies. The\nexperimental findings reveal that the suggested framework has a detection\naccuracy of 0.9864, which is greater than current techniques. As a result, the\nsuggested object detection model outperforms other current methods.",

    "abstract": "Shapley values, which were originally designed to assign attributions to\nindividual players in coalition games, have become a commonly used approach in\nexplainable machine learning to provide attributions to input features for\nblack-box machine learning models. A key attraction of Shapley values is that\nthey uniquely satisfy a very natural set of axiomatic properties. However,\nextending the Shapley value to assigning attributions to interactions rather\nthan individual players, an interaction index, is non-trivial: as the natural\nset of axioms for the original Shapley values, extended to the context of\ninteractions, no longer specify a unique interaction index. Many proposals thus\nintroduce additional less \"natural\" axioms, while sacrificing the key axiom of\nefficiency, in order to obtain unique interaction indices. In this work, rather\nthan introduce additional conflicting axioms, we adopt the viewpoint of Shapley\nvalues as coefficients of the most faithful linear approximation to the\npseudo-Boolean coalition game value function. By extending linear to\n$\\ell$-order polynomial approximations, we can then define the general family\nof faithful interaction indices}. We show that by additionally requiring the\nfaithful interaction indices to satisfy interaction-extensions of the standard\nindividual Shapley axioms (dummy, symmetry, linearity, and efficiency), we\nobtain a unique FaithfulShapley Interaction index, which we denote Faith-Shap,\nas a natural generalization of the Shapley value to interactions. We then\nprovide some illustrative contrasts of Faith-Shap with previously proposed\ninteraction indices, and further investigate some of its interesting algebraic\nproperties.

To efficiently complete this\ntask, we propose a target-driven grasping system that simultaneously considers\nobject relations and predicts 6-DoF grasp poses. A densely cluttered scene is\nfirst formulated as a grasp graph with nodes representing object geometries in\nthe grasp coordinate frame and edges indicating spatial relations between the\nobjects.

While it is true\nthat in certain niche scenarios, uncertainty in lead times can be ignored, most\nreal-world scenarios exhibit stochasticity in lead times. These random\nfluctuations can be caused due to uncertainty in arrival of raw materials at\nthe manufacturer's end, delay in transportation, an unforeseen surge in\ndemands, and switching to a different vendor, to name a few. Stochasticity in\nlead times is known to severely degrade the performance in an inventory\nmanagement system, and it is only fair to abridge this gap in supply chain\nsystem through a principled approach. Motivated by the recently introduced\ndelay-resolved deep Q-learning (DRDQN) algorithm, this paper develops a\nreinforcement learning based paradigm for handling uncertainty in lead times\n(\\emph{action delay}). Through empirical evaluations, it is further shown that\nthe inventory management with uncertain lead times is not only equivalent to\nthat of delay in information sharing across multiple echelons\n(\\emph{observation delay}), a model trained to handle one kind of delay is\ncapable to handle delays of another kind without requiring to be retrained.\nFinally, we apply the delay-resolved framework to scenarios comprising of\nmultiple products subjected to stochasticity in lead times, and elucidate how\nthe delay-resolved framework negates the effect of any delay to achieve\nnear-optimal performance.",

Experiments show\nthat the proposed method achieves as much as 51% relative word error rate (WER)\nreduction over ASR system and outperforms traditional biasing methods.

    "abstract": "Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems show\ngreat potentials in low-mobility scenarios, due to cell boundary disappearance\nand strong macro diversity. However, the great Doppler frequency offset (DFO)\nleads to serious inter-carrier interference in orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM) technology, which makes it difficult to provide\nhigh-quality transmissions for both high-speed train (HST) operation control\nsystems and passengers. In this paper, we focus on the performance of CF\nmassive MIMO-OFDM systems with both fully centralized and local minimum mean\nsquare error (MMSE) combining in HST communications. Considering the local\nmaximum ratio (MR) combining, the large-scale fading decoding (LSFD)\ncooperation and the practical effect of DFO on system performance, exact\nclosed-form expressions for uplink spectral efficiency (SE) expressions are\nderived. We observe that cooperative MMSE combining achieves better SE\nperformance than uncooperative MR combining. In addition, HST communications\nwith small cell and cellular massive MIMO-OFDM systems are compared in terms of\nSE. Numerical results reveal that the CF massive MIMO-OFDM system achieves a\nlarger and more uniform SE than the other systems. Finally, the train antenna\ncentric (TA-centric) CF massive MIMO-OFDM system is designed for practical\nimplementation in HST communications, and three power control schemes are\nadopted to optimize the propagation of TAs for reducing the impact of the DFO.",

For this gap, we\nattempt to investigate the forensic-oriented image representation as a distinct\nproblem, from the perspectives of theory, implementation, and application. Our\nwork starts from the abstraction of basic principles that the representation\nfor forensics should satisfy, especially revealing the criticality of\nrobustness, interpretability, and coverage. At the theoretical level, we\npropose a new representation framework for forensics, called Dense Invariant\nRepresentation (DIR), which is characterized by stable description with\nmathematical guarantees. At the implementation level, the discrete calculation\nproblems of DIR are discussed, and the corresponding accurate and fast\nsolutions are designed with generic nature and constant complexity. We\ndemonstrate the above arguments on the dense-domain pattern detection and\nmatching experiments, providing comparison results with state-of-the-art\ndescriptors.

The key insight in\nMIAShield is weakening the strong membership signal that stems from the\npresence of a target sample by preemptively excluding it at prediction time\nwithout compromising model utility. To that end, we design and evaluate a suite\nof preemptive exclusion oracles leveraging model-confidence, exact or\napproximate sample signature, and learning-based exclusion of member data\npoints. To be practical, MIAShield splits a training data into disjoint subsets\nand trains each subset to build an ensemble of models. The disjointedness of\nsubsets ensures that a target sample belongs to only one subset, which isolates\nthe sample to facilitate the preemptive exclusion goal.\nWe evaluate MIAShield on three benchmark image classification datasets. We\nshow that MIAShield effectively mitigates membership inference (near random\nguess) for a wide range of MIAs, achieves far better privacy-utility trade-off\ncompared with state-of-the-art defenses, and remains resilient against an\nadaptive adversary.",

Our method performs\ncontinual learning by transferring knowledge across tasks by retrieving the\ndescriptors of similar modes of past tasks to the mode of a current sequence\nand feeding this descriptor into its transition kernel as control input. We\nobserve the continual learning performance of our method to compare favorably\nto the mainstream parameter transfer approach.",

However, despite their state-of-the-art performance\nin predictive graph-based applications, recent studies have shown that GNNs can\nraise significant privacy concerns when graph data contain sensitive\ninformation. As a result, in this paper, we study the problem of learning GNNs\nwith Differential Privacy (DP). We propose GAP, a novel differentially private\nGNN that safeguards the privacy of nodes and edges using aggregation\nperturbation, i.e., adding calibrated stochastic noise to the output of the\nGNN's aggregation function, which statistically obfuscates the presence of a\nsingle edge (edge-level privacy) or a single node and all its adjacent edges\n(node-level privacy). To circumvent the accumulation of privacy cost at every\nforward pass of the model, we tailor the GNN architecture to the specifics of\nprivate learning. In particular, we first precompute private aggregations by\nrecursively applying neighborhood aggregation and perturbing the output of each\naggregation step. Then, we privately train a deep neural network on the\nresulting perturbed aggregations for any node-wise classification task. A major\nadvantage of GAP over previous approaches is that we guarantee edge-level and\nnode-level DP not only for training, but also at inference time with no\nadditional costs beyond the training's privacy budget. We theoretically analyze\nthe formal privacy guarantees of GAP using R\\'enyi DP.

A class of codes is said\nto be asymptotically good if there exists a positive real $\\delta$ such that,\nfor any positive integer $N$ we can find a code in the class with code length\ngreater than $N$, and with both the rate and the relative minimum distance\ngreater than $\\delta$. The linear codes over any finite field are\nasymptotically good. More interestingly, the (asymptotic) GV-bound is a phase\ntransition point for the linear codes; i.e., asymptotically speaking, the\nparameters of most linear codes attain the GV-bound. It is a long-standing open\nquestion: whether or not the cyclic codes over a finite field (which are an\nimportant class of codes) are asymptotically good? However, from a long time\nago the quasi-cyclic codes of index $2$ were proved to be asymptotically good.\nThis chapter consists of some of our studies on the asymptotic properties of\nseveral classes of quasi-group codes. We'll explain the studies in a consistent\nand self-contained style. We begin with the classical results on linear codes.\nIn many cases we consider the quasi-group codes over finite abelian groups\n(including the cyclic case as a subcase of course), and study their asymptotic\nproperties along two directions: (1) the order of the group (the coindex) is\nfixed while the index is going to infinity; (2) the index is small while the\norder of the group (the coindex) is going to infinity. Finally we describe the\nstory on dihedral codes. The dihedral groups are non-abelian but near to cyclic\ngroups (they have cyclic subgroups of index $2$). The asymptotic goodness of\nbinary dihedral codes was obtained in the beginning of this century, and\nextended to the general dihedral codes recently.",

    "abstract": "Extracting class activation maps (CAM) is arguably the most standard step of\ngenerating pseudo masks for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS).\nYet, we find that the crux of the unsatisfactory pseudo masks is the binary\ncross-entropy loss (BCE) widely used in CAM. Specifically, due to the\nsum-over-class pooling nature of BCE, each pixel in CAM may be responsive to\nmultiple classes co-occurring in the same receptive field. As a result, given a\nclass, its hot CAM pixels may wrongly invade the area belonging to other\nclasses, or the non-hot ones may be actually a part of the class. To this end,\nwe introduce an embarrassingly simple yet surprisingly effective method:\nReactivating the converged CAM with BCE by using softmax cross-entropy loss\n(SCE), dubbed \\textbf{ReCAM}. Given an image, we use CAM to extract the feature\npixels of each single class, and use them with the class label to learn another\nfully-connected layer (after the backbone) with SCE. Once converged, we extract\nReCAM in the same way as in CAM. Thanks to the contrastive nature of SCE, the\npixel response is disentangled into different classes and hence less mask\nambiguity is expected.

Moreover, due to isolation from main grid and abundance of renewable\npower generation units like solar PV, the inertia of these standalone grids is\nreduced greatly and calls for advanced control algorithms which use an\nabundance of sensors. Hence, the stability of these systems is greatly affected\nby sensor failures apart from many physical parameters like load and\nenvironmental conditions. In this thesis, a generic structure of an AC-DC\nhybrid microgrid is considered which is subdivided into various AC and DC\ncounterparts. The AC and DC SSMGs are separately modeled and control solutions\nare proposed to improve their stability. The first two contributions propose\nadaptive control schemes on the primary level of control in the hybrid\nmicrogrid. Their function is to provide fast and stable parameters regulation\nin the DCSSMG when subjected to atmospheric changes along with faults in sensor\nreadings. The third and fourth contributions cater to development of\ncoordinated control cyber physical frameworks in the ACSSMG to handle the\npresence of simultaneous disturbances from both cyber/physical domains.",

    "abstract": "As industrial systems become more complex and monitoring sensors for\neverything from surveillance to our health become more ubiquitous, multivariate\ntime series prediction is taking an important place in the smooth-running of\nour society. A recurrent neural network with attention to help extend the\nprediction windows is the current-state-of-the-art for this task. However, we\nargue that their vanishing gradients, short memories, and serial architecture\nmake RNNs fundamentally unsuited to long-horizon forecasting with complex data.\nTemporal convolutional networks (TCNs) do not suffer from gradient problems and\nthey support parallel calculations, making them a more appropriate choice.\nAdditionally, they have longer memories than RNNs, albeit with some instability\nand efficiency problems. Hence, we propose a framework, called PSTA-TCN, that\ncombines a parallel spatio-temporal attention mechanism to extract dynamic\ninternal correlations with stacked TCN backbones to extract features from\ndifferent window sizes. The framework makes full use parallel calculations to\ndramatically reduce training times, while substantially increasing accuracy\nwith stable prediction windows up to 13 times longer than the status quo.",

Tree-based planning approaches, such as rapidly exploring\nrandom tree (RRT), are the dominant approach to finding globally optimal plans\nin continuous state-space motion planning. Central to these approaches is\ntree-expansion, the procedure in which new nodes are added into an\never-expanding tree. We study the kinodynamic variants of tree-based planning,\nwhere we have known system dynamics and kinematic constraints. In the interest\nof quickly selecting nodes to connect newly sampled coordinates, existing\nmethods typically cannot optimise to find nodes which have low cost to\ntransition to sampled coordinates. Instead they use metrics like Euclidean\ndistance between coordinates as a heuristic for selecting candidate nodes to\nconnect to the search tree. We propose L4KDE to address this issue. L4KDE uses\na neural network to predict transition costs between queried states, which can\nbe efficiently computed in batch, providing much higher quality estimates of\ntransition cost compared to commonly used heuristics while maintaining\nalmost-surely asymptotic optimality guarantee. We empirically demonstrate the\nsignificant performance improvement provided by L4KDE on a variety of\nchallenging system dynamics, with the ability to generalise across different\ninstances of the same model class, and in conjunction with a suite of modern\ntree-based motion planners.",

We consider a dynamic optimization\napproach, which embraces wireless channel fluctuations and random deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) task arrivals over an infinite horizon. Specifically, we\nintroduce a local CPU workload queue (WD-QSI) and an MEC server workload queue\n(MEC-QSI) to model the dynamic workload of DNN tasks at each WD and the MEC\nserver, respectively. The transmit power and the partitioning of the local DNN\ntask at each WD are dynamically determined based on the instantaneous channel\nconditions (to capture the transmission opportunities) and the instantaneous\nWD-QSI and MEC-QSI (to capture the dynamic urgency of the tasks) to minimize\nthe average latency of the DNN tasks. The joint optimization can be formulated\nas an ergodic Markov decision process (MDP), in which the optimality condition\nis characterized by a centralized Bellman equation. However, the brute force\nsolution of the MDP is not viable due to the curse of dimensionality as well as\nthe requirement for knowledge of the global state information. To overcome\nthese issues, we first decompose the MDP into multiple lower dimensional\nsub-MDPs, each of which can be associated with a WD or the MEC server. Next, we\nfurther develop a parametric online Q-learning algorithm, so that each sub-MDP\nis solved locally at its associated WD or the MEC server.

    "abstract": "Continual Learning (CL) is the research field addressing learning settings\nwhere the data distribution is not static. This paper studies spurious\nfeatures' influence on continual learning algorithms. Indeed, we show that\nlearning algorithms solve tasks by overfitting features that are not\ngeneralizable. To better understand these phenomena and their impact, we\npropose a domain incremental scenario that we study through various\nout-of-distribution generalizations and continual learning algorithms. The\nexperiments of this paper show that continual learning algorithms face two\nrelated challenges: (1) the spurious features challenge: some features are well\ncorrelated with labels in train data but not in test data due to a covariate\nshift between train and test. (2) the local spurious features challenge: some\nfeatures correlate well with labels within a task but not within the whole task\nsequence. The challenge is to learn general features that are neither spurious\n(in general) nor locally spurious. We prove that the latter is a major cause of\nperformance decrease in continual learning along with catastrophic forgetting.\nOur results indicate that the best solution to overcome the feature selection\nproblems varies depending on the correlation between spurious features (SFs)\nand labels. The vanilla replay approach seems to be a powerful approach to deal\nwith SFs, which could explain its good performance in the continual learning\nliterature.

    "abstract": "Tables organize valuable content in a concise and compact representation.\nThis content is extremely valuable for systems such as search engines,\nKnowledge Graph's, etc, since they enhance their predictive capabilities.\nUnfortunately, tables come in a large variety of shapes and sizes. Furthermore,\nthey can have complex column/row-header configurations, multiline rows,\ndifferent variety of separation lines, missing entries, etc. As such, the\ncorrect identification of the table-structure from an image is a non-trivial\ntask. In this paper, we present a new table-structure identification model. The\nlatter improves the latest end-to-end deep learning model (i.e.\nencoder-dual-decoder from PubTabNet) in two significant ways. First, we\nintroduce a new object detection decoder for table-cells. In this way, we can\nobtain the content of the table-cells from programmatic PDF's directly from the\nPDF source and avoid the training of the custom OCR decoders. This\narchitectural change leads to more accurate table-content extraction and allows\nus to tackle non-english tables. Second, we replace the LSTM decoders with\ntransformer based decoders. This upgrade improves significantly the previous\nstate-of-the-art tree-editing-distance-score (TEDS) from 91% to 98.5% on simple\ntables and from 88.7% to 95% on complex tables.",

    "abstract": "In the Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, the learning is guided through\na reward signal. This means that in situations of sparse rewards the agent has\nto focus on exploration, in order to discover which action, or set of actions\nleads to the reward. RL agents usually struggle with this. Exploration is the\nfocus of Quality-Diversity (QD) methods. In this thesis, we approach the\nproblem of sparse rewards with these algorithms, and in particular with Novelty\nSearch (NS). This is a method that only focuses on the diversity of the\npossible policies behaviors. The first part of the thesis focuses on learning a\nrepresentation of the space in which the diversity of the policies is\nevaluated. In this regard, we propose the TAXONS algorithm, a method that\nlearns a low-dimensional representation of the search space through an\nAutoEncoder. While effective, TAXONS still requires information on when to\ncapture the observation used to learn said space. For this, we study multiple\nways, and in particular the signature transform, to encode information about\nthe whole trajectory of observations. The thesis continues with the\nintroduction of the SERENE algorithm, a method that can efficiently focus on\nthe interesting parts of the search space. This method separates the\nexploration of the search space from the exploitation of the reward through a\ntwo-alternating-steps approach. The exploration is performed through NS. Any\ndiscovered reward is then locally exploited through emitters. The third and\nfinal contribution combines TAXONS and SERENE into a single approach: STAX.\nThroughout this thesis, we introduce methods that lower the amount of prior\ninformation needed in sparse rewards settings. These contributions are a\npromising step towards the development of methods that can autonomously explore\nand find high-performance policies in a variety of sparse rewards settings.",

Data\nacquisition is time-consuming and costly due to the challenging subsea\nenvironment. Reducing the number of projections in a scan can yield time and\ncost savings, but compromises the reconstruction quality, if conventional\nreconstruction methods are used. In this work we take a Bayesian approach to CT\nreconstruction and focus on designing an effective prior to make use of\navailable structural information about the pipe geometry. We propose a new\nclass of structural Gaussian priors to enforce expected material properties in\ndifferent regions of the reconstructed image based on independent Gaussian\npriors in combination with global regularity through a Gaussian Markov Random\nField (GMRF) prior. Numerical experiments with synthetic and real data show\nthat the proposed structural Gaussian prior can reduce artifacts and enhance\ncontrast in the reconstruction compared to using only a global GMRF prior or no\nprior at all.

Recent work has therefore\nequipped the latent space with a suitable metric to enforce shortest paths on\nthe manifold of generated samples.

Over the course of its development, the label supervision has been\nconsidered necessary for accurate alignments. Inspired by the recent progress\nof self-supervised learning, we explore the extent to which we can get rid of\nsupervision for entity alignment. Commonly, the label information (positive\nentity pairs) is used to supervise the process of pulling the aligned entities\nin each positive pair closer. However, our theoretical analysis suggests that\nthe learning of entity alignment can actually benefit more from pushing\nunlabeled negative pairs far away from each other than pulling labeled positive\npairs close.

We present SelfKG with efficient\nstrategies to optimize this objective for aligning entities without label\nsupervision. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nSelfKG without supervision can match or achieve comparable results with\nstate-of-the-art supervised baselines.

Popular\nreconstruction methods for computed tomography are based on idealized models\nand assumptions that may not be valid in practice. One such assumption is that\nthe exact projection geometry is known. The projection geometry describes the\nrelative location of the radiation source, object, and detector for each\nprojection. However, in practice, the geometric parameters used to describe the\nposition and orientation of the radiation source, object, and detector are\nestimated quantities with uncertainty. A failure to accurately estimate the\ngeometry may lead to reconstructions with severe misalignment artifacts that\nsignificantly decrease their scientific or diagnostic value. We propose a novel\nreconstruction method that jointly estimates the reconstruction and the\nprojection geometry. The reconstruction method is based on a Bayesian approach\nthat yields a point estimate for the reconstruction and geometric parameters\nand, in addition, provides valuable information regarding their uncertainty.\nThis is achieved by approximately sampling from the joint posterior\ndistribution of the reconstruction and projection geometry using a hierarchical\nGibbs sampler.

    "abstract": "As an important fine-grained sentiment analysis problem, aspect-based\nsentiment analysis (ABSA), aiming to analyze and understand people's opinions\nat the aspect level, has been attracting considerable interest in the last\ndecade. To handle ABSA in different scenarios, various tasks have been\nintroduced for analyzing different sentiment elements and their relations,\nincluding the aspect term, aspect category, opinion term, and sentiment\npolarity. Unlike early ABSA works focusing on a single sentiment element, many\ncompound ABSA tasks involving multiple elements have been studied in recent\nyears for capturing more complete aspect-level sentiment information. However,\na systematic review of various ABSA tasks and their corresponding solutions is\nstill lacking, which we aim to fill in this survey. More specifically, we\nprovide a new taxonomy for ABSA which organizes existing studies from the axes\nof concerned sentiment elements, with an emphasis on recent advances of\ncompound ABSA tasks. From the perspective of solutions, we summarize the\nutilization of pre-trained language models for ABSA, which improved the\nperformance of ABSA to a new stage. Besides, techniques for building more\npractical ABSA systems in cross-domain/lingual scenarios are discussed.\nFinally, we review some emerging topics and discuss some open challenges to\noutlook potential future directions of ABSA.",

    "abstract": "Online action detection has attracted increasing research interests in recent\nyears. Current works model historical dependencies and anticipate future to\nperceive the action evolution within a video segment and improve the detection\naccuracy. However, the existing paradigm ignores category-level modeling and\ndoes not pay sufficient attention to efficiency. Considering a category, its\nrepresentative frames exhibit various characteristics. Thus, the category-level\nmodeling can provide complementary guidance to the temporal dependencies\nmodeling. In this paper, we develop an effective exemplar-consultation\nmechanism that first measures the similarity between a frame and exemplary\nframes, and then aggregates exemplary features based on the similarity weights.\nThis is also an efficient mechanism as both similarity measurement and feature\naggregation require limited computations. Based on the exemplar-consultation\nmechanism, the long-term dependencies can be captured by regarding historical\nframes as exemplars, and the category-level modeling can be achieved by\nregarding representative frames from a category as exemplars. Due to the\ncomplementarity from the category-level modeling, our method employs a\nlightweight architecture but achieves new high performance on three benchmarks.\nIn addition, using a spatio-temporal network to tackle video frames, our method\nspends 9.8 seconds to dispose of a one-minute video and achieves comparable\nperformance.",

This feature is especially\nnotable on micro aerial robots with low maneuverability or scenarios where the\nspace is not enough. Moreover, we design a flexible transformation strategy to\neliminate terminal constraints along with reducing optimization variables.\nBesides, we take precise SE(3) motion planning into account to ensure that the\ndrone would not touch the landing platform until the last moment. The proposed\nmethod is validated onboard by a palm-sized micro aerial robot with quite\nlimited thrust and moment (thrust-to-weight ratio 1.7) perching on a mobile\ninclined surface. Sufficient experimental results show that our planner\ngenerates an optimal trajectory within 20ms, and replans with warm start in\n2ms.",

However, it is subject to the replicability crisis that\ncurrently affects most algorithmic AI research. Benchmarking in Reinforcement\nLearning could be improved through verifiable results. There are numerous\nbenchmark environments whose scores are used to compare different algorithms,\nsuch as Atari. Nevertheless, reviewers must trust that figures represent\ntruthful values, as it is difficult to reproduce an exact training curve. We\npropose improving this situation by providing access to the original\nexperimental data to validate study results. To that end, we rely on the\nconcept of minimal traces. These allow re-simulation of action sequences in\ndeterministic RL environments and, in turn, enable reviewers to verify, re-use,\nand manually inspect experimental results without needing large compute\nclusters. It also permits validation of presented reward graphs, an inspection\nof individual episodes, and re-use of result data (baselines) for proper\ncomparison in follow-up papers.

However, recently the performance increase of serial instruction\nexecution has stagnated. As a consequence, computer architectures have started\nto diversify. Combined with the fact that the size of main memories has\nsignificantly increased it becomes more important to exploit intrinsic internal\nfeatures of computer systems (data coherence mechanisms, TLB and instruction\ncache performance, among others) rather than mainly focusing on minimizing disk\nI/O. Time has come for a re-evaluation of how (traditional) query optimization\nis implemented. Query optimizers must be able to cope with disruptive advances\nin computer architecture and employ methods to optimize for\narchitecture-specific features. In this paper, the query optimization process\nis redefined so that compiler optimizations are taken into the game much\nearlier than traditionally is done and employ compiler optimizations as the\ndriving force in query optimization.

In this paper, we study a natural online variant of delegation, in\nwhich the agent searches through the options in an online fashion.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in various tasks,\nbut their performance highly relies on a large number of labeled nodes, which\ntypically requires considerable human effort. GNN-based Active Learning (AL)\nmethods are proposed to improve the labeling efficiency by selecting the most\nvaluable nodes to label. Existing methods assume an oracle can correctly\ncategorize all the selected nodes and thus just focus on the node selection.\nHowever, such an exact labeling task is costly, especially when the\ncategorization is out of the domain of individual expert (oracle). The paper\ngoes further, presenting a soft-label approach to AL on GNNs. Our key\ninnovations are: i) relaxed queries where a domain expert (oracle) only judges\nthe correctness of the predicted labels (a binary question) rather than\nidentifying the exact class (a multi-class question), and ii) new criteria of\nmaximizing information gain propagation for active learner with relaxed queries\nand soft labels. Empirical studies on public datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art GNN-based AL methods in\nterms of both accuracy and labeling cost.",

    "abstract": "Hashing technology gains much attention in protecting the biometric template\nlately. For instance, Index-of-Max (IoM), a recent reported hashing technique,\nis a ranking-based locality sensitive hashing technique, which illustrates the\nfeasibility to protect the ordered and fixed-length biometric template.\nHowever, biometric templates are not always in the form of ordered and\nfixed-length, rather it may be an unordered and variable size point set e.g.\nfingerprint minutiae, which restricts the usage of the traditional hashing\ntechnology. In this paper, we proposed a generalized version of IoM hashing\nnamely gIoM, and therefore the unordered and variable size biometric template\ncan be used. We demonstrate a realization using a well-known variable size\nfeature vector, fingerprint Minutia Cylinder-Code (MCC). The gIoM transforms\nMCC into index domain to form indexing-based feature representation.\nConsequently, the inversion of MCC from the transformed representation is\ncomputational infeasible, thus to achieve non-invertibility while the\nperformance is preserved. Public fingerprint databases FVC2002 and FVC2004 are\nemployed for experiment as benchmark to demonstrate a fair comparison with\nother methods. Moreover, the security and privacy analysis suggest that gIoM\nmeets the criteria of template protection: non-invertibility, revocability, and\nnon-linkability.",

The results shown that this type of AFD\nalgorithm have the potential to detect up to 82.8% of the energy losses with\nspecificity above 90%.

It is difficult to collect and communicate\nstream samples while storing, transmitting and computing a function across the\nwhole stream or even a large segment of it. In answer to this research issue,\nmany streaming-specific solutions were developed. Stream techniques imply a\nlimited capacity of one or more resources such as computing power and memory,\nas well as time or accuracy limits. Reservoir sampling algorithms choose and\nstore results that are probabilistically significant. A weighted random\nsampling approach using a generalised sampling algorithmic framework to detect\nunique events is the key research goal of this work. Briefly, a gradually\ndeveloped estimate of the joint stream distribution across all feasible\ncomponents keeps k stream elements judged representative for the full stream.\nOnce estimate confidence is high, k samples are chosen evenly. The complexity\nis O(min(k,n-k)), where n is the number of items inspected. Due to the fact\nthat events are usually considered outliers, it is sufficient to extract\nelement patterns and push them to an alternate version of k-means as proposed\nhere. The suggested technique calculates the sum of squared errors (SSE) for\neach cluster, and this is utilised not only as a measure of convergence, but\nalso as a quantification and an indirect assessment of the element\ndistribution's approximation accuracy. This clustering enables for the\ndetection of outliers in the stream based on their distance from the usual\nevent centroids.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of smart manufacturing, data-driven machinery\nhealth management has received a growing attention. As one of the most popular\nmethods in machinery health management, deep learning (DL) has achieved\nremarkable successes. However, due to the issues of limited samples and poor\nseparability of different cavitation states of acoustic signals, which greatly\nhinder the eventual performance of DL modes for cavitation intensity\nrecognition and cavitation detection. In this work, a novel multi-task learning\nframework for simultaneous cavitation detection and cavitation intensity\nrecognition framework using 1-D double hierarchical residual networks (1-D\nDHRN) is proposed for analyzing valves acoustic signals. Firstly, a data\naugmentation method based on sliding window with fast Fourier transform\n(Swin-FFT) is developed to alleviate the small-sample issue confronted in this\nstudy. Secondly, a 1-D double hierarchical residual block (1-D DHRB) is\nconstructed to capture sensitive features from the frequency domain acoustic\nsignals of valve. Then, a new structure of 1-D DHRN is proposed. Finally, the\ndevised 1-D DHRN is evaluated on two datasets of valve acoustic signals without\nnoise (Dataset 1 and Dataset 2) and one dataset of valve acoustic signals with\nrealistic surrounding noise (Dataset 3) provided by SAMSON AG (Frankfurt). Our\nmethod has achieved state-of-the-art results. The prediction accurcies of 1-D\nDHRN for cavitation intensitys recognition are as high as 93.75%, 94.31% and\n100%, which indicates that 1-D DHRN outperforms other DL models and\nconventional methods. At the same time, the testing accuracies of 1-D DHRN for\ncavitation detection are as high as 97.02%, 97.64% and 100%. In addition, 1-D\nDHRN has also been tested for different frequencies of samples and shows\nexcellent results for frequency of samples that mobile phones can accommodate.",

The core idea of our method is that contextual information is\ncritical to tell the difference when the instance geometry is incomplete or\nfeatureless. We find that relations between proposals provide a good\nrepresentation to describe the context. However, adopting relations between all\nthe object or patch proposals for detection is inefficient, and an imbalanced\ncombination of local and global relations brings extra noise that could mislead\nthe training. Rather than working with all relations, we found that training\nwith relations only between the most representative ones, or anchors, can\nsignificantly boost the detection performance. A good anchor should be\nsemantic-aware with no ambiguity and independent with other anchors as well. To\nfind the anchors, we first perform a preliminary relation anchor module with an\nobjectness-aware sampling approach and then devise a displacement-based module\nfor weighing the relation importance for better utilization of contextual\ninformation. This lightweight relation module leads to significantly higher\naccuracy of object instance detection when being plugged into the\nstate-of-the-art detectors.

    "abstract": "We address the problem of devising the means for a robot to rapidly and\nsafely learn insertion skills with just a few human interventions and without\nhand-crafted rewards or demonstrations. Our InsertionNet version 2.0 provides\nan improved technique to robustly cope with a wide range of use-cases featuring\ndifferent shapes, colors, initial poses, etc. In particular, we present a\nregression-based method based on multimodal input from stereo perception and\nforce, augmented with contrastive learning for the efficient learning of\nvaluable features. In addition, we introduce a one-shot learning technique for\ninsertion, which relies on a relation network scheme to better exploit the\ncollected data and to support multi-step insertion tasks. Our method improves\non the results obtained with the original InsertionNet, achieving an almost\nperfect score (above 97.5$\\%$ on 200 trials) in 16 real-life insertion tasks\nwhile minimizing the execution time and contact during insertion. We further\ndemonstrate our method's ability to tackle a real-life 3-step insertion task\nand perfectly solve an unseen insertion task without learning.",

    "abstract": "Research on recommender systems algorithms, like other areas of applied\nmachine learning, is largely dominated by efforts to improve the\nstate-of-the-art, typically in terms of accuracy measures. Several recent\nresearch works however indicate that the reported improvements over the years\nsometimes \"don't add up\", and that methods that were published several years\nago often outperform the latest models when evaluated independently. Different\nfactors contribute to this phenomenon, including that some researchers probably\noften only fine-tune their own models but not the baselines. In this paper, we\nreport the outcomes of an in-depth, systematic, and reproducible comparison of\nten collaborative filtering algorithms - covering both traditional and neural\nmodels - on several common performance measures on three datasets which are\nfrequently used for evaluation in the recent literature. Our results show that\nthere is no consistent winner across datasets and metrics for the examined\ntop-n recommendation task. Moreover, we find that for none of the accuracy\nmeasurements any of the considered neural models led to the best performance.\nRegarding the performance ranking of algorithms across the measurements, we\nfound that linear models, nearest-neighbor methods, and traditional matrix\nfactorization consistently perform well for the evaluated modest-sized, but\ncommonly-used datasets. Our work shall therefore serve as a guideline for\nresearchers regarding existing baselines to consider in future performance\ncomparisons. Moreover, by providing a set of fine-tuned baseline models for\ndifferent datasets, we hope that our work helps to establish a common\nunderstanding of the state-of-the-art for top-n recommendation tasks.",

In this paper, we\ncontribute descriptive research around the life of \"AI\" as a discursive concept\nand organizational practice in an understudied sphere--emerging AI\nstartups--and with a focus on extra-organizational pressures faced by\nentrepreneurs. Leveraging a theoretical lens for how organizations change, we\nconducted semi-structured interviews with 23 entrepreneurs working at\nearly-stage AI startups. We find that actors within startups both conform to\nand resist institutional pressures. Our analysis identifies a central tension\nfor AI entrepreneurs: they often valued scientific integrity and methodological\nrigor; however, influential external stakeholders either lacked the technical\nknowledge to appreciate entrepreneurs' emphasis on rigor or were more focused\non business priorities. As a result, entrepreneurs adopted hyped marketing\nmessages about AI that diverged from their scientific values, but attempted to\npreserve their legitimacy internally. Institutional pressures and\norganizational constraints also influenced entrepreneurs' modeling practices\nand their response to actual or impending regulation.

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are known as a typical kind of brain-inspired\nmodels with their unique features of rich neuronal dynamics, diverse coding\nschemes and low power consumption properties. How to obtain a high-accuracy\nmodel has always been the main challenge in the field of SNN. Currently, there\nare two mainstream methods, i.e., obtaining a converted SNN through converting\na well-trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to its SNN counterpart or\ntraining an SNN directly. However, the inference time of a converted SNN is too\nlong, while SNN training is generally very costly and inefficient. In this\nwork, a new SNN training paradigm is proposed by combining the concepts of the\ntwo different training methods with the help of the pretrain technique and\nBP-based deep SNN training mechanism. We believe that the proposed paradigm is\na more efficient pipeline for training SNNs. The pipeline includes pipeS for\nstatic data transfer tasks and pipeD for dynamic data transfer tasks. SOTA\nresults are obtained in a large-scale event-driven dataset ES-ImageNet. For\ntraining acceleration, we achieve the same (or higher) best accuracy as similar\nLIF-SNNs using 1/10 training time on ImageNet-1K and 2/5 training time on\nES-ImageNet and also provide a time-accuracy benchmark for a new dataset\nES-UCF101.

In this paper, we (i) propose a\nnovel adversarial perturbation detection scheme based on multi-task perception\nof complex vision tasks (i.e., depth estimation and semantic segmentation).\nSpecifically, adversarial perturbations are detected by inconsistencies between\nextracted edges of the input image, the depth output, and the segmentation\noutput. To further improve this technique, we (ii) develop a novel edge\nconsistency loss between all three modalities, thereby improving their initial\nconsistency which in turn supports our detection scheme.

In addition, we (iii) develop a multi-task adversarial attack, aiming\nat fooling both tasks as well as our detection scheme. Experimental evaluation\non the Cityscapes and KITTI datasets shows that under an assumption of a 5%\nfalse positive rate up to 100% of images are correctly detected as\nadversarially perturbed, depending on the strength of the perturbation.

An intrinsic limitation of this family\nof \"fully-attentive\" architectures arises from the computation of the\ndot-product attention, which grows both in memory consumption and number of\noperations as $O(n^2)$ where $n$ stands for the input sequence length, thus\nlimiting the applications that require modeling very long sequences.

    "abstract": "Barwise and Seligman stated the first principle of information flow:\n\"Information flow results from regularities in the distributed system.\" They\nrepresent a distributed system in terms of a classification consisting of a set\nof objects or tokens to be classified, a set of types used to classify tokens,\nand a binary relation between tokens and types that tells one which tokens are\nclassified as being of which types. We aim to further this investigation and\nproceed with a dynamic or evolving system instead of a static system. We claim\nthat a classification is a snapshot of a distributed system at a given moment\nor context. We then aim to answer the question posed by an evolving context. As\nthe context or configuration changes, how to regularities evolve. This paper is\na continuation of an investigation we started in \\cite{esterlin}, where we\ninitiated how to capture a dynamism of information flow with a Kripke\nstructure. Here we develop the same procedure with colored Petri net(CPN). We\nfirst extend the classification concept to multiclassification by replacing its\nbinary relation between tokens and types with a multi relation: a function from\ntok(A) x typ(A) to N, the set of natural numbers. The multiclassification will\nunfold into binary classification in order to compute its theory. It turns out\nthat markings of a CPN are multiclassification; Amalgamating the theories of\nthose classifications obtained as markings of CPN results in a CPN's knowledge\nbase.",

    "title": "DextAIRity: Deformable Manipulation Can be a Breeze",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces DextAIRity, an approach to manipulate deformable\nobjects using active airflow. In contrast to conventional contact-based\nquasi-static manipulations, DextAIRity allows the system to apply dense forces\non out-of-contact surfaces, expands the system's reach range, and provides safe\nhigh-speed interactions. These properties are particularly advantageous when\nmanipulating under-actuated deformable objects with large surface areas or\nvolumes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DextAIRity through two challenging\ndeformable object manipulation tasks: cloth unfolding and bag opening. We\npresent a self-supervised learning framework that learns to effectively perform\na target task through a sequence of grasping or air-based blowing actions. By\nusing a closed-loop formulation for blowing, the system continuously adjusts\nits blowing direction based on visual feedback in a way that is robust to the\nhighly stochastic dynamics. We deploy our algorithm on a real-world three-arm\nsystem and present evidence suggesting that DextAIRity can improve system\nefficiency for challenging deformable manipulation tasks, such as cloth\nunfolding, and enable new applications that are impractical to solve with\nquasi-static contact-based manipulations (e.g., bag opening).

    "title": "Linear Stochastic Bandits over a Bit-Constrained Channel",
    "abstract": "One of the primary challenges in large-scale distributed learning stems from\nstringent communication constraints. While several recent works address this\nchallenge for static optimization problems, sequential decision-making under\nuncertainty has remained much less explored in this regard. Motivated by this\ngap, we introduce a new linear stochastic bandit formulation over a\nbit-constrained channel. Specifically, in our setup, an agent interacting with\nan environment transmits encoded estimates of an unknown model parameter to a\nserver over a communication channel of finite capacity. The goal of the server\nis to take actions based on these estimates to minimize cumulative regret. To\nthis end, we develop a novel and general algorithmic framework that hinges on\ntwo main components: (i) an adaptive encoding mechanism that exploits\nstatistical concentration bounds, and (ii) a decision-making principle based on\nconfidence sets that account for encoding errors. As our main result, we prove\nthat when the unknown model is $d$-dimensional, a channel capacity of $O(d)$\nbits suffices to achieve order-optimal regret. To demonstrate the generality of\nour approach, we then show that the same result continues to hold for\nnon-linear observation models satisfying standard regularity conditions.\nFinally, we establish that for the simpler unstructured multi-armed bandit\nproblem, $1$ bit channel-capacity is sufficient for achieving optimal regret\nbounds. Overall, our work takes a significant first step towards paving the way\nfor statistical decision-making over finite-capacity channels.",

    "abstract": "Gradual semantics within abstract argumentation associate a numeric score\nwith every argument in a system, which represents the level of acceptability of\nthis argument, and from which a preference ordering over arguments can be\nderived. While some semantics operate over standard argumentation frameworks,\nmany utilise a weighted framework, where a numeric initial weight is associated\nwith each argument. Recent work has examined the inverse problem within gradual\nsemantics. Rather than determining a preference ordering given an argumentation\nframework and a semantics, the inverse problem takes an argumentation\nframework, a gradual semantics, and a preference ordering as inputs, and\nidentifies what weights are needed to over arguments in the framework to obtain\nthe desired preference ordering. Existing work has attacked the inverse problem\nnumerically, using a root finding algorithm (the bisection method) to identify\nappropriate initial weights. In this paper we demonstrate that for a class of\ngradual semantics, an analytical approach can be used to solve the inverse\nproblem. Unlike the current state-of-the-art, such an analytic approach can\nrapidly find a solution, and is guaranteed to do so. In obtaining this result,\nwe are able to prove several important properties which previous work had posed\nas conjectures.",

Researchers have recently found an intrinsic\ntrade-off between the accuracy and smoothness of neural networks, so training a\nnetwork with a loose Lipschitz constant estimation imposes a strong\nregularization and can hurt the model accuracy significantly. In this work, we\nprovide a unified theoretical framework, a quantitative geometric approach, to\naddress the Lipschitz constant estimation. By adopting this framework, we can\nimmediately obtain several theoretical results, including the computational\nhardness of Lipschitz constant estimation and its approximability. Furthermore,\nthe quantitative geometric perspective can also provide some insights into\nrecent empirical observations that techniques for one norm do not usually\ntransfer to another one.\nWe also implement the algorithms induced from this quantitative geometric\napproach in a tool GeoLIP. These algorithms are based on semidefinite\nprogramming (SDP). Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that GeoLIP is more\nscalable and precise than existing tools on Lipschitz constant estimation for\n$\\ell_\\infty$-perturbations.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is an emerging privacy-preserving paradigm that\nenables multiple participants collaboratively to train a global model without\nuploading raw data. Considering heterogeneous computing and communication\ncapabilities of different participants, asynchronous FL can avoid the\nstragglers effect in synchronous FL and adapts to scenarios with vast\nparticipants. Both staleness and non-IID data in asynchronous FL would reduce\nthe model utility. However, there exists an inherent contradiction between the\nsolutions to the two problems. That is, mitigating the staleness requires to\nselect less but consistent gradients while coping with non-IID data demands\nmore comprehensive gradients. To address the dilemma, this paper proposes a\ntwo-stage weighted $K$ asynchronous FL with adaptive learning rate (WKAFL). By\nselecting consistent gradients and adjusting learning rate adaptively, WKAFL\nutilizes stale gradients and mitigates the impact of non-IID data, which can\nachieve multifaceted enhancement in training speed, prediction accuracy and\ntraining stability. We also present the convergence analysis for WKAFL under\nthe assumption of unbounded staleness to understand the impact of staleness and\nnon-IID data.

    "title": "On the Optimization Landscape of Neural Collapse under MSE Loss: Global  Optimality with Unconstrained Features",
    "abstract": "When training deep neural networks for classification tasks, an intriguing\nempirical phenomenon has been widely observed in the last-layer classifiers and\nfeatures, where (i) the class means and the last-layer classifiers all collapse\nto the vertices of a Simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) up to scaling, and\n(ii) cross-example within-class variability of last-layer activations collapses\nto zero. This phenomenon is called Neural Collapse (NC), which seems to take\nplace regardless of the choice of loss functions. In this work, we justify NC\nunder the mean squared error (MSE) loss, where recent empirical evidence shows\nthat it performs comparably or even better than the de-facto cross-entropy\nloss. Under a simplified unconstrained feature model, we provide the first\nglobal landscape analysis for vanilla nonconvex MSE loss and show that the\n(only!) global minimizers are neural collapse solutions, while all other\ncritical points are strict saddles whose Hessian exhibit negative curvature\ndirections. Furthermore, we justify the usage of rescaled MSE loss by probing\nthe optimization landscape around the NC solutions, showing that the landscape\ncan be improved by tuning the rescaling hyperparameters. Finally, our\ntheoretical findings are experimentally verified on practical network\narchitectures.",

    "abstract": "In recent years we have witnessed an increase on the development of methods\nfor submodular optimization, which have been motivated by the wide\napplicability of submodular functions in real-world data-science problems. In\nthis paper, we contribute to this line of work by considering the problem of\nrobust submodular maximization against unexpected deletions, which may occur\ndue to privacy issues or user preferences. Specifically, we study and derive\nbounds for the minimum number of items a streaming algorithm has to remember,\nin order to achieve a non-trivial approximation guarantee against adversarial\ndeletions up to $d$ items. We call the set of items that are kept by the\nalgorithm before adversarial deletions a deletion-robust coreset. We propose a\nsingle-pass streaming algorithm that yields a $(1-\\epsilon)/(4p)$-approximation\nfor maximizing a non-decreasing submodular function under a general $p$-matroid\nconstraint and requires a coreset size $k + d/\\epsilon$, where $k$ is the\nmaximum size of a feasible solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work to achieve an (asymptotically) optimal coreset size, as no constant\napproximation is possible with a coreset of size sublinear in $d$.",

In this paper, we present a novel Embedding-Querying paradigm\n(EQ-Paradigm) for 3D understanding tasks including detection, segmentation and\nclassification. EQ-Paradigm is a unified paradigm that enables the combination\nof any existing 3D backbone architectures with different task heads. Under the\nEQ-Paradigm, the input is firstly encoded in the embedding stage with an\narbitrary feature extraction architecture, which is independent of tasks and\nheads. Then, the querying stage enables the encoded features to be applicable\nfor diverse task heads. This is achieved by introducing an intermediate\nrepresentation, i.e., Q-representation, in the querying stage to serve as a\nbridge between the embedding stage and task heads. We design a novel Q-Net as\nthe querying stage network. Extensive experimental results on various 3D tasks\nincluding semantic segmentation, object detection and shape classification show\nthat EQ-Paradigm in tandem with Q-Net is a general and effective pipeline,\nwhich enables a flexible collaboration of backbones and heads, and further\nboosts the performance of the state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Introduced as a notion of algorithmic fairness, multicalibration has proved\nto be a powerful and versatile concept with implications far beyond its\noriginal intent. This stringent notion -- that predictions be well-calibrated\nacross a rich class of intersecting subpopulations -- provides its strong\nguarantees at a cost: the computational and sample complexity of learning\nmulticalibrated predictors are high, and grow exponentially with the number of\nclass labels. In contrast, the relaxed notion of multiaccuracy can be achieved\nmore efficiently, yet many of the most desirable properties of multicalibration\ncannot be guaranteed assuming multiaccuracy alone. This tension raises a key\nquestion: Can we learn predictors with multicalibration-style guarantees at a\ncost commensurate with multiaccuracy?\nIn this work, we define and initiate the study of Low-Degree\nMulticalibration. Low-Degree Multicalibration defines a hierarchy of\nincreasingly-powerful multi-group fairness notions that spans multiaccuracy and\nthe original formulation of multicalibration at the extremes. Our main\ntechnical contribution demonstrates that key properties of multicalibration,\nrelated to fairness and accuracy, actually manifest as low-degree properties.\nImportantly, we show that low-degree multicalibration can be significantly more\nefficient than full multicalibration. In the multi-class setting, the sample\ncomplexity to achieve low-degree multicalibration improves exponentially (in\nthe number of classes) over full multicalibration. Our work presents compelling\nevidence that low-degree multicalibration represents a sweet spot, pairing\ncomputational and sample efficiency with strong fairness and accuracy\nguarantees.",

However, the effectiveness of these\nmethods can be easily corrupted by post-processing operations such as\ncompression. Inspired by transfer learning, neural networks pre-trained on\nother large-scale face-related tasks may provide useful features for deepfake\ndetection. For example, lip movement has been proved to be a kind of robust and\ngood-transferring highlevel semantic feature, which can be learned from the\nlipreading task. However, the existing method pre-trains the lip feature\nextraction model in a supervised manner, which requires plenty of human\nresources in data annotation and increases the difficulty of obtaining training\ndata. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised transformer based\naudio-visual contrastive learning method. The proposed method learns mouth\nmotion representations by encouraging the paired video and audio\nrepresentations to be close while unpaired ones to be diverse.

This is remedied by a\nmyriad of methods involving human sensing or intention decoding, as well as\nhuman-robot turn-taking and sequential task planning. However, the physical\ninteraction establishes a rich channel of communication through forces, torques\nand haptics in general, which is often overlooked in industrial implementations\nof human-robot interaction. In this work, we investigate the role of haptics in\nhuman collaborative physical tasks, to identify how to integrate physical\ncommunication in human-robot teams. We present a task to balance a ball at a\ntarget position on a board either bimanually by one participant, or dyadically\nby two participants, with and without haptic information. The task requires\nthat the two sides coordinate with each other, in real-time, to balance the\nball at the target.

Moreover we found that the presence of\nhaptic information improved the performance (decreased completion time) and led\nto an increase in overall cooperative movements.

    "title": "Providing Insights for Open-Response Surveys via End-to-End  Context-Aware Clustering",
    "abstract": "Teachers often conduct surveys in order to collect data from a predefined\ngroup of students to gain insights into topics of interest. When analyzing\nsurveys with open-ended textual responses, it is extremely time-consuming,\nlabor-intensive, and difficult to manually process all the responses into an\ninsightful and comprehensive report. In the analysis step, traditionally, the\nteacher has to read each of the responses and decide on how to group them in\norder to extract insightful information. Even though it is possible to group\nthe responses only using certain keywords, such an approach would be limited\nsince it not only fails to account for embedded contexts but also cannot detect\npolysemous words or phrases and semantics that are not expressible in single\nwords. In this work, we present a novel end-to-end context-aware framework that\nextracts, aggregates, and abbreviates embedded semantic patterns in\nopen-response survey data. Our framework relies on a pre-trained natural\nlanguage model in order to encode the textual data into semantic vectors. The\nencoded vectors then get clustered either into an optimally tuned number of\ngroups or into a set of groups with pre-specified titles. In the former case,\nthe clusters are then further analyzed to extract a representative set of\nkeywords or summary sentences that serve as the labels of the clusters. In our\nframework, for the designated clusters, we finally provide context-aware\nwordclouds that demonstrate the semantically prominent keywords within each\ngroup. Honoring user privacy, we have successfully built the on-device\nimplementation of our framework suitable for real-time analysis on mobile\ndevices and have tested it on a synthetic dataset. Our framework reduces the\ncosts at-scale by automating the process of extracting the most insightful\ninformation pieces from survey data.",

    "abstract": "Cascading failures are a common phenomenon in complex networked systems where\nfailures at only a few nodes may trigger a process of sequential failure. We\napplied a flow redistribution model to investigate the robustness against\ncascading failures in modern systems carrying flows/loads (i.e. power grid,\ntransportation system, etc.) that contain multiple interdependent networks. In\nsuch a system, the coupling coefficients between networks, which determine how\nmuch flows/loads are redistributed between networks, are a key factor\ndetermining the robustness to cascading failures. We derive recursive\nexpressions to characterize the evolution of such a system under dynamic\nnetwork coupling. Using these expressions, we enhance the robustness of\ninterdependent network systems by dynamically adjusting the coupling\ncoefficients based on current system situations, minimizing the subsequent\nfailures. The analytical and simulation results show a significant improvement\nin robustness compared to prior work, which considers only fixed coupling\ncoefficients. Our proposed Step-wise Optimization (SWO) method not only shows\ngood performance against cascading failures, but also offers better\ncomputational complexity, scalability to multiple networks, and flexibility to\ndifferent attack types. We show in simulation that SWO provides robustness\nagainst cascading failures for multiple different network topologies.",

One such class of methods frames\nenvironment design as a game between a student and a teacher, using\nregret-based objectives to produce environment instantiations (or levels) at\nthe frontier of the student agent's capabilities. These methods benefit from\ntheir generality, with theoretical guarantees at equilibrium, yet they often\nstruggle to find effective levels in challenging design spaces. By contrast,\nevolutionary approaches seek to incrementally alter environment complexity,\nresulting in potentially open-ended learning, but often rely on domain-specific\nheuristics and vast amounts of computational resources. In this paper we\npropose to harness the power of evolution in a principled, regret-based\ncurriculum. Our approach, which we call Adversarially Compounding Complexity by\nEditing Levels (ACCEL), seeks to constantly produce levels at the frontier of\nan agent's capabilities, resulting in curricula that start simple but become\nincreasingly complex.

Being sourced by the electron pressure field, the tSZ effect depends on\nbaryonic physics that is usually modeled by expensive hydrodynamic simulations.\nWe train neural networks on the IllustrisTNG-300 cosmological simulation to\npredict the continuous electron pressure field in galaxy clusters from\ngravity-only simulations. Modeling clusters is challenging for neural networks\nas most of the gas pressure is concentrated in a handful of voxels and even the\nlargest hydrodynamical simulations contain only a few hundred clusters that can\nbe used for training. Instead of conventional convolutional neural net (CNN)\narchitectures, we choose to employ a rotationally equivariant DeepSets\narchitecture to operate directly on the set of dark matter particles. We argue\nthat set-based architectures provide distinct advantages over CNNs. For\nexample, we can enforce exact rotational and permutation equivariance,\nincorporate existing knowledge on the tSZ field, and work with sparse fields as\nare standard in cosmology. We compose our architecture with separate,\nphysically meaningful modules, making it amenable to interpretation. For\nexample, we can separately study the influence of local and cluster-scale\nenvironment, determine that cluster triaxiality has negligible impact, and\ntrain a module that corrects for mis-centering.

    "title": "Towards a SAT Encoding for Quantum Circuits: A Journey From Classical  Circuits to Clifford Circuits and Beyond",
    "abstract": "Satisfiability Testing (SAT) techniques are well-established in classical\ncomputing where they are used to solve a broad variety of problems, e.g., in\nthe design of classical circuits and systems. Analogous to the classical realm,\nquantum algorithms are usually modelled as circuits and similar design tasks\nneed to be tackled. Thus, it is natural to pose the question whether these\ndesign tasks in the quantum realm can also be approached using SAT techniques.\nTo the best of our knowledge, no SAT formulation for arbitrary quantum circuits\nexists and it is unknown whether such an approach is feasible at all. In this\nwork, we define a propositional SAT encoding that, in principle, can be applied\nto arbitrary quantum circuits. However, we show that due to the inherent\ncomplexity of representing quantum states, constructing such an encoding is not\nfeasible in general. Therefore, we establish general criteria for determining\nthe feasibility of the proposed encoding and identify classes of quantum\ncircuits fulfilling these criteria. We explicitly demonstrate how the proposed\nencoding can be applied to the class of Clifford circuits as a representative.\nFinally, we empirically demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the\nproposed encoding for Clifford circuits. With these results, we lay the\nfoundation for continuing the ongoing success of SAT in classical circuit and\nsystems design for quantum circuits.",

    "title": "Simulation Paths for Quantum Circuit Simulation with Decision Diagrams",
    "abstract": "Simulating quantum circuits on classical computers is a notoriously hard, yet\nincreasingly important task for the development and testing of quantum\nalgorithms. In order to alleviate this inherent complexity, efficient data\nstructures and methods such as tensor networks and decision diagrams have been\nproposed. However, their efficiency heavily depends on the order in which the\nindividual computations are performed. For tensor networks the order is defined\nby so-called contraction plans and a plethora of methods has been developed to\ndetermine suitable plans. On the other hand, simulation based on decision\ndiagrams is mostly conducted in a straight-forward, i.e., sequential, fashion\nthus far. In this work, we study the importance of the path that is chosen when\nsimulating quantum circuits using decision diagrams. We propose an open-source\nframework that not only allows to investigate dedicated simulation paths, but\nalso to re-use existing findings, e.g., obtained from determining contraction\nplans for tensor networks. Experimental evaluations show that translating\nstrategies from the domain of tensor networks can already yield speedups of up\nto several orders of magnitude compared to the state of the art. Furthermore,\nwe show, both conceptually and experimentally, that choosing the right\nsimulation path can result in runtimes practically independent of the number of\nqubits -- as opposed to exponential runtimes using the state-of-the-art\napproach. The proposed framework is publicly available at\ngithub.com/cda-tum/ddsim.",

    "abstract": "In conventional molecular communication (MC) systems, the signaling molecules\nused for information transmission are stored, released, and then replenished by\na transmitter (TX). However, the replenishment of signaling molecules at the TX\nis challenging in practice. Furthermore, in most envisioned MC applications,\ne.g., in the medical field, it is not desirable to insert the TX into the MC\nsystem, as this might impair natural biological processes. In this paper, we\npropose the concept of media modulation based MC where the TX is placed outside\nthe channel and utilizes signaling molecules already present inside the system.\nThe signaling molecules can assume different states which can be switched by\nexternal stimuli. Hence, in media modulation based MC, the TX modulates\ninformation into the state of the signaling molecules. In particular, we\nexploit the group of photochromic molecules, which undergo light-induced\nreversible state transitions, for media modulation. We study the usage of these\nmolecules for information transmission in a three-dimensional duct system,\nwhich contains an eraser, a TX, and a receiver for erasing, writing, and\nreading of information via external light, respectively. We develop a\nstatistical model for the received signal. We adopt a maximum likelihood\ndetector and show that it can be reduced to a threshold based detector.\nFurthermore, we derive analytical expressions for the optimal threshold value\nand the resulting bit error rate (BER), respectively. Finally, we investigate\nthe impact of various system parameters on the BER of media modulation based\nMC. Both the statistical model and BER results are verified by computer\nsimulations. Our results reveal that media modulation enables reliable\ninformation transmission, validating it as a promising alternative to MC based\non molecule emitting TXs.",

These structural\nbarriers are known to take many forms at different scales - hubs in otherwise\nsparse organisations, large dense teams, or global core-periphery structure -\nbut we lack an understanding of how these different structures interact. Here\nwe bridge the gap between the mathematical literature on localization of\nspreading dynamics and the more applied literature on knowledge silos in\norganizational interaction networks. To do so, we introduce a new model that\nconsiders a layered structure of teams to unveil a new form of hierarchical\nlocalization (i.e., the localization of information at the top or center of an\norganization) and study its interplay with known phenomena of mesoscopic\nlocalization (i.e., the localization of information in large groups), $k$-core\nlocalization (i.e., around denser $k$-cores) and hub localization (i.e., around\nhigh degree stars). We also include a complex contagion mechanism by\nconsidering a general infection kernel which can depend on hierarchical level\n(influence), degree (popularity), infectious neighbors (social reinforcement)\nor team size (importance). This general model allows us to study the\nmultifaceted phenomenon of information siloing in complex organizational\ninteraction networks and opens the door to new optimization problems to promote\nor hinder the emergence of different localization regimes.",

Prominent examples are the Kullback-Leibler information\ndistance (relative entropy) which e.g. is closely connected to the omnipresent\nmaximum likelihood estimation method, and Pearson's chisquare-distance which\ne.g. is used for the celebrated chisquare goodness-of-fit test. Another line of\nstatistical inference is built upon distribution-function-based divergences\nsuch as e.g. the prominent (weighted versions of) Cramer-von Mises test\nstatistics respectively Anderson-Darling test statistics which are frequently\napplied for goodness-of-fit investigations; some more recent methods deal with\n(other kinds of) cumulative paired divergences and closely related concepts. In\nthis paper, we provide a general framework which covers in particular both the\nabove-mentioned density-based and distribution-function-based divergence\napproaches; the dissimilarity of quantiles respectively of other statistical\nfunctionals will be included as well. From this framework, we structurally\nextract numerous classical and also state-of-the-art (including new)\nprocedures. Furthermore, we deduce new concepts of dependence between random\nvariables, as alternatives to the celebrated mutual information. Some\nvariational representations are discussed, too.",

To improve real world\napplicability of such models, there are growing interests to develop models\noptimized for arbitrary upscaling factors. Our proposed method is the first to\ntreat arbitrary rescaling, both upscaling and downscaling, as one unified\nprocess. Using joint optimization of both directions, the proposed model is\nable to learn upscaling and downscaling simultaneously and achieve\nbidirectional arbitrary image rescaling. It improves the performance of current\narbitrary upscaling models by a large margin while at the same time learns to\nmaintain visual perception quality in downscaled images. The proposed model is\nfurther shown to be robust in cycle idempotence test, free of severe\ndegradations in reconstruction accuracy when the downscaling-to-upscaling cycle\nis applied repetitively. This robustness is beneficial for image rescaling in\nthe wild when this cycle could be applied to one image for multiple times. It\nalso performs well on tests with arbitrary large scales and asymmetric scales,\neven when the model is not trained with such tasks.

We propose a\nnew vision on neural network robustness using Riemannian geometry and foliation\ntheory, and create a new adversarial attack by taking into account the\ncurvature of the data space. This new adversarial attack called the \"dog-leg\nattack\" is a two-step approximation of a geodesic in the data space. The data\nspace is treated as a (pseudo) Riemannian manifold equipped with the pullback\nof the Fisher Information Metric (FIM) of the neural network. In most cases,\nthis metric is only semi-definite and its kernel becomes a central object to\nstudy. A canonical foliation is derived from this kernel. The curvature of the\nfoliation's leaves gives the appropriate correction to get a two-step\napproximation of the geodesic and hence a new efficient adversarial attack. Our\nattack is tested on a toy example, a neural network trained to mimic the\n$\\texttt{Xor}$ function, and demonstrates better results that the state of the\nart attack presented by Zhao et al.

However, we observe that thequality scores of an image given by a group\nof subjects are verysubjective and diverse. Thus it is not enough to use a MOS\ntodescribe the image quality. In this paper, we propose to describeimage\nquality using a parameterized distribution rather thana MOS, and an objective\nmethod is also proposed to predictthe image quality score distribution (IQSD).\nAt first, the LIVEdatabase is re-recorded. Specifically, we have invited a\nlargegroup of subjects to evaluate the quality of all images in theLIVE\ndatabase, and each image is evaluated by a large numberof subjects (187 valid\nsubjects), whose scores can form a reliableIQSD. By analyzing the obtained\nsubjective quality scores, wefind that the IQSD can be well modeled by an alpha\nstable model,and it can reflect much more information than a single MOS, suchas\nthe skewness of opinion score, the subject diversity and themaximum probability\nscore for an image. Therefore, we proposeto model the IQSD using the alpha\nstable model. Moreover, wepropose a framework and an algorithm to predict the\nalphastable model based IQSD, where quality features are extractedfrom each\nimage based on structural information and statisticalinformation, and support\nvector regressors are trained to predictthe alpha stable model parameters.\nExperimental results verifythe feasibility of using alpha stable model to\ndescribe the IQSD,and prove the effectiveness of objective alpha stable model\nbasedIQSD prediction method.",

This complexity hinders their real-time deployment on modern lidar\narrays which acquire billions of photons per second.

    "abstract": "Low-rank matrix estimation under heavy-tailed noise is challenging, both\ncomputationally and statistically. Convex approaches have been proven\nstatistically optimal but suffer from high computational costs, especially\nsince robust loss functions are usually non-smooth. More recently,\ncomputationally fast non-convex approaches via sub-gradient descent are\nproposed, which, unfortunately, fail to deliver a statistically consistent\nestimator even under sub-Gaussian noise. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nRiemannian sub-gradient (RsGrad) algorithm which is not only computationally\nefficient with linear convergence but also is statistically optimal, be the\nnoise Gaussian or heavy-tailed. Convergence theory is established for a general\nframework and specific applications to absolute loss, Huber loss and quantile\nloss are investigated. Compared with existing non-convex methods, ours reveals\na surprising phenomenon of dual-phase convergence. In phase one, RsGrad behaves\nas in a typical non-smooth optimization that requires gradually decaying\nstepsizes. However, phase one only delivers a statistically sub-optimal\nestimator which is already observed in existing literature. Interestingly,\nduring phase two, RsGrad converges linearly as if minimizing a smooth and\nstrongly convex objective function and thus a constant stepsize suffices.\nUnderlying the phase-two convergence is the smoothing effect of random noise to\nthe non-smooth robust losses in an area close but not too close to the truth.\nNumerical simulations confirm our theoretical discovery and showcase the\nsuperiority of RsGrad over prior methods.",

Firstly, a sparse distance matrix is calculated by using\nK-d tree to replace the original full rank distance matrix, so as to accelerate\nthe calculation of local density. Secondly, a sparse search strategy is\nproposed to accelerate the computation of relative-separation with the\nintersection between the set of k nearest neighbors and the set consisting of\nthe data points with larger local density for any data point. Furthermore, a\nsecond-order difference method for decision values is adopted to determine the\ncluster centers adaptively.

It is proved that the algorithm can effectively\nreduce the computational complexity. Especially for larger datasets, the\nefficiency is elevated more remarkably.

We provide\nsuch an axiomatization for weakly modular graphs and their principal subclasses\n(median and modular graphs, bridged graphs, Helly graphs, dual polar graphs,\netc), basis graphs of matroids and even $\\Delta$-matroids, partial cubes and\ntheir subclasses (ample partial cubes, tope graphs of oriented matroids and\ncomplexes of oriented matroids, bipartite Pasch and Peano graphs, cellular and\nhypercellular partial cubes, almost-median graphs, netlike partial cubes), and\nGromov hyperbolic graphs. On the other hand, we show that some classes of\ngraphs (including chordal, planar, Eulerian, and dismantlable graphs), closely\nrelated with Metric Graph Theory, but defined in a combinatorial or topological\nway, do not allow such an axiomatization.",

    "title": "Shape constrained CNN for segmentation guided prediction of myocardial  shape and pose parameters in cardiac MRI",
    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is the\nstate-of-the-art for many medical image segmentation tasks including myocardial\nsegmentation in cardiac MR images. However, the predicted segmentation maps\nobtained from such standard CNN do not allow direct quantification of regional\nshape properties such as regional wall thickness. Furthermore, the CNNs lack\nexplicit shape constraints, occasionally resulting in unrealistic\nsegmentations. In this paper, we use a CNN to predict shape parameters of an\nunderlying statistical shape model of the myocardium learned from a training\nset of images. Additionally, the cardiac pose is predicted, which allows to\nreconstruct the myocardial contours. The integrated shape model regularizes the\npredicted contours and guarantees realistic shapes. We enforce robustness of\nshape and pose prediction by simultaneously performing pixel-wise semantic\nsegmentation during training and define two loss functions to impose\nconsistency between the two predicted representations: one distance-based loss\nand one overlap-based loss. We evaluated the proposed method in a 5-fold cross\nvalidation on an in-house clinical dataset with 75 subjects and on the ACDC and\nLVQuan19 public datasets. We show the benefits of simultaneous semantic\nsegmentation and the two newly defined loss functions for the prediction of\nshape parameters. Our method achieved a correlation of 99% for left ventricular\n(LV) area on the three datasets, between 91% and 97% for myocardial area,\n98-99% for LV dimensions and between 80% and 92% for regional wall thickness.",

Framing the problem as a self-supervised task, where data\nsamples are discriminated from noise samples, is at the core of\nstate-of-the-art methods, beginning with Noise-Contrastive Estimation (NCE).\nYet, such contrastive learning requires a good noise distribution, which is\nhard to specify; domain-specific heuristics are therefore widely used. While a\ncomprehensive theory is missing, it is widely assumed that the optimal noise\nshould in practice be made equal to the data, both in distribution and\nproportion. This setting underlies Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in\nparticular. Here, we empirically and theoretically challenge this assumption on\nthe optimal noise.

    "title": "Estimating average causal effects from patient trajectories",
    "abstract": "In medical practice, treatments are selected based on the expected causal\neffects on patient outcomes. Here, the gold standard for estimating causal\neffects are randomized controlled trials; however, such trials are costly and\nsometimes even unethical. Instead, medical practice is increasingly interested\nin estimating causal effects among patient subgroups from electronic health\nrecords, that is, observational data. In this paper, we aim at estimating the\naverage causal effect (ACE) from observational data (patient trajectories) that\nare collected over time. For this, we propose DeepACE: an end-to-end deep\nlearning model. DeepACE leverages the iterative G-computation formula to adjust\nfor the bias induced by time-varying confounders. Moreover, we develop a novel\nsequential targeting procedure which ensures that DeepACE has favorable\ntheoretical properties, i.e., is doubly robust and asymptotically efficient. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes an end-to-end\ndeep learning model for estimating time-varying ACEs. We compare DeepACE in an\nextensive number of experiments, confirming that it achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance. We further provide a case study for patients suffering from low\nback pain to demonstrate that DeepACE generates important and meaningful\nfindings for clinical practice. Our work enables medical practitioners to\ndevelop effective treatment recommendations tailored to patient subgroups.",

    "abstract": "Exoplanet observations are currently analysed with Bayesian retrieval\ntechniques. Due to the computational load of the models used, a compromise is\nneeded between model complexity and computing time. Analysis of data from\nfuture facilities, will need more complex models which will increase the\ncomputational load of retrievals, prompting the search for a faster approach\nfor interpreting exoplanet observations. Our goal is to compare machine\nlearning retrievals of exoplanet transmission spectra with nested sampling, and\nunderstand if machine learning can be as reliable as Bayesian retrievals for a\nstatistically significant sample of spectra while being orders of magnitude\nfaster. We generate grids of synthetic transmission spectra and their\ncorresponding planetary and atmospheric parameters, one using free chemistry\nmodels, and the other using equilibrium chemistry models. Each grid is\nsubsequently rebinned to simulate both HST/WFC3 and JWST/NIRSpec observations,\nyielding four datasets in total. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are\ntrained with each of the datasets. We perform retrievals on a 1,000 simulated\nobservations for each combination of model type and instrument with nested\nsampling and machine learning. We also use both methods to perform retrievals\non real WFC3 transmission spectra. Finally, we test how robust machine learning\nand nested sampling are against incorrect assumptions in our models. CNNs reach\na lower coefficient of determination between predicted and true values of the\nparameters. Nested sampling underestimates the uncertainty in ~8% of\nretrievals, whereas CNNs estimate them correctly. For real WFC3 observations,\nnested sampling and machine learning agree within $2\\sigma$ for ~86% of\nspectra. When doing retrievals with incorrect assumptions, nested sampling\nunderestimates the uncertainty in ~12% to ~41% of cases, whereas this is always\nbelow ~10% for the CNN.",

    "abstract": "Emerging sampling algorithms based on normalizing flows have the potential to\nsolve ergodicity problems in lattice calculations. Furthermore, it has been\nnoted that flows can be used to compute thermodynamic quantities which are\ndifficult to access with traditional methods. This suggests that they are also\napplicable to the density-of-states approach to complex action problems. In\nparticular, flow-based sampling may be used to compute the density directly, in\ncontradistinction to the conventional strategy of reconstructing it via\nmeasuring and integrating the derivative of its logarithm. By circumventing\nthis procedure, the accumulation of errors from the numerical integration is\navoided completely and the overall normalization factor can be determined\nexplicitly. In this proof-of-principle study, we demonstrate our method in the\ncontext of two-component scalar field theory where the $O(2)$ symmetry is\nexplicitly broken by an imaginary external field. First, we concentrate on the\nzero-dimensional case which can be solved exactly. We show that with our\nmethod, the Lee-Yang zeroes of the associated partition function can be\nsuccessfully located. Subsequently, we confirm that the flow-based approach\ncorrectly reproduces the density computed with conventional methods in one- and\ntwo-dimensional models.",

VHTS\nof catalysts, however, is often accompanied with high calculation failure rate\nand wasted computational resources due to the difficulty of simultaneously\nconverging all mechanistically relevant reactive intermediates to expected\ngeometries and electronic states. We demonstrate a dynamic classifier approach,\ni.e., a convolutional neural network that monitors geometry optimization on the\nfly, and exploit its good performance and transferability for catalyst design.\nWe show that the dynamic classifier performs well on all reactive intermediates\nin the representative catalytic cycle of the radical rebound mechanism for\nmethane-to-methanol despite being trained on only one reactive intermediate.\nThe dynamic classifier also generalizes to chemically distinct intermediates\nand metal centers absent from the training data without loss of accuracy or\nmodel confidence. We rationalize this superior model transferability to the use\nof on-the-fly electronic structure and geometric information generated from\ndensity functional theory calculations and the convolutional layer in the\ndynamic classifier.
