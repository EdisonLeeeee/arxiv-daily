    "abstract": "For autoregressive (AR) modeling of high-resolution images, vector\nquantization (VQ) represents an image as a sequence of discrete codes. A short\nsequence length is important for an AR model to reduce its computational costs\nto consider long-range interactions of codes. However, we postulate that\nprevious VQ cannot shorten the code sequence and generate high-fidelity images\ntogether in terms of the rate-distortion trade-off. In this study, we propose\nthe two-stage framework, which consists of Residual-Quantized VAE (RQ-VAE) and\nRQ-Transformer, to effectively generate high-resolution images. Given a fixed\ncodebook size, RQ-VAE can precisely approximate a feature map of an image and\nrepresent the image as a stacked map of discrete codes. Then, RQ-Transformer\nlearns to predict the quantized feature vector at the next position by\npredicting the next stack of codes. Thanks to the precise approximation of\nRQ-VAE, we can represent a 256$\\times$256 image as 8$\\times$8 resolution of the\nfeature map, and RQ-Transformer can efficiently reduce the computational costs.\nConsequently, our framework outperforms the existing AR models on various\nbenchmarks of unconditional and conditional image generation. Our approach also\nhas a significantly faster sampling speed than previous AR models to generate\nhigh-quality images.",

Contrary\nto offline methods for time-optimal path parameterization, the reference path\ncan be changed during motion execution. In addition, our approach can utilize\nsensory feedback, for instance, to follow a reference path with a bipedal robot\nwithout losing balance. With our method, the robot is controlled by a neural\nnetwork that is trained via reinforcement learning using data generated by a\nphysics simulator. From a mathematical perspective, the problem of tracking a\nreference path in a time-optimized manner is formalized as a Markov decision\nprocess. Each state includes a fixed number of waypoints specifying the next\npart of the reference path. The action space is designed in such a way that all\nresulting motions comply with the specified kinematic joint limits. The reward\nfunction finally reflects the trade-off between the execution time, the\ndeviation from the desired reference path and optional additional objectives\nlike balancing. We evaluate our approach with and without additional objectives\nand show that time-optimized path tracking can be successfully learned for both\nindustrial and humanoid robots.

    "abstract": "Pre-trained multilingual language models such as mBERT and XLM-R have\ndemonstrated great potential for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to low\nweb-resource languages (LRL). However, due to limited model capacity, the large\ndifference in the sizes of available monolingual corpora between high\nweb-resource languages (HRL) and LRLs does not provide enough scope of\nco-embedding the LRL with the HRL, thereby affecting downstream task\nperformance of LRLs. In this paper, we argue that relatedness among languages\nin a language family along the dimension of lexical overlap may be leveraged to\novercome some of the corpora limitations of LRLs. We propose Overlap BPE\n(OBPE), a simple yet effective modification to the BPE vocabulary generation\nalgorithm which enhances overlap across related languages. Through extensive\nexperiments on multiple NLP tasks and datasets, we observe that OBPE generates\na vocabulary that increases the representation of LRLs via tokens shared with\nHRLs. This results in improved zero-shot transfer from related HRLs to LRLs\nwithout reducing HRL representation and accuracy. Unlike previous studies that\ndismissed the importance of token-overlap, we show that in the low-resource\nrelated language setting, token overlap matters. Synthetically reducing the\noverlap to zero can cause as much as a four-fold drop in zero-shot transfer\naccuracy.",

    "abstract": "Action representation is an important yet often overlooked aspect in\nend-to-end robot learning with deep networks. Choosing one action space over\nanother (e.g. target joint positions, or Cartesian end-effector poses) can\nresult in surprisingly stark performance differences between various downstream\ntasks -- and as a result, considerable research has been devoted to finding the\nright action space for a given application. However, in this work, we instead\ninvestigate how our models can discover and learn for themselves which action\nspace to use. Leveraging recent work on implicit behavioral cloning, which\ntakes both observations and actions as input, we demonstrate that it is\npossible to present the same action in multiple different spaces to the same\npolicy -- allowing it to learn inductive patterns from each space.\nSpecifically, we study the benefits of combining Cartesian and joint action\nspaces in the context of learning manipulation skills. To this end, we present\nImplicit Kinematic Policies (IKP), which incorporates the kinematic chain as a\ndifferentiable module within the deep network. Quantitative experiments across\nseveral simulated continuous control tasks -- from scooping piles of small\nobjects, to lifting boxes with elbows, to precise block insertion with\nmiscalibrated robots -- suggest IKP not only learns complex prehensile and\nnon-prehensile manipulation from pixels better than baseline alternatives, but\nalso can learn to compensate for small joint encoder offset errors. Finally, we\nalso run qualitative experiments on a real UR5e to demonstrate the feasibility\nof our algorithm on a physical robotic system with real data.

By performing model disentanglement into unimodal contributions\n(UC) and multimodal interactions (MI), our proposed approach, DIME, enables\naccurate and fine-grained analysis of multimodal models while maintaining\ngenerality across arbitrary modalities, model architectures, and tasks. Through\na comprehensive suite of experiments on both synthetic and real-world\nmultimodal tasks, we show that DIME generates accurate disentangled\nexplanations, helps users of multimodal models gain a deeper understanding of\nmodel behavior, and presents a step towards debugging and improving these\nmodels for real-world deployment.

    "abstract": "Causal discovery from observational and interventional data is challenging\ndue to limited data and non-identifiability which introduces uncertainties in\nestimating the underlying structural causal model (SCM). Incorporating these\nuncertainties and selecting optimal experiments (interventions) to perform can\nhelp to identify the true SCM faster. Existing methods in experimental design\nfor causal discovery from limited data either rely on linear assumptions for\nthe SCM or select only the intervention target.

Domain adaptation\n(DA) targets this setting, however, existing DA can not be applied directly to\nHGNNs.

In\nthis work, we address the issue of zero-shot domain adaptation in HGNNs. We\nfirst theoretically induce a relationship between source and target domain\nfeatures extracted from HGNNs, then propose a novel domain adaptation method,\nKnowledge Transfer Networks for HGNNs (HGNN-KTN). HGNN-KTN learns the\nrelationship between source and target features, then maps the target\ndistributions into the source domain.

    "title": "Provable and Efficient Continual Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "In continual learning (CL), the goal is to design models that can learn a\nsequence of tasks without catastrophic forgetting. While there is a rich set of\ntechniques for CL, relatively little understanding exists on how\nrepresentations built by previous tasks benefit new tasks that are added to the\nnetwork. To address this, we study the problem of continual representation\nlearning (CRL) where we learn an evolving representation as new tasks arrive.\nFocusing on zero-forgetting methods where tasks are embedded in subnetworks\n(e.g., PackNet), we first provide experiments demonstrating CRL can\nsignificantly boost sample efficiency when learning new tasks. To explain this,\nwe establish theoretical guarantees for CRL by providing sample complexity and\ngeneralization error bounds for new tasks by formalizing the statistical\nbenefits of previously-learned representations. Our analysis and experiments\nalso highlight the importance of the order in which we learn the tasks.\nSpecifically, we show that CL benefits if the initial tasks have large sample\nsize and high \"representation diversity\". Diversity ensures that adding new\ntasks incurs small representation mismatch and can be learned with few samples\nwhile training only few additional nonzero weights. Finally, we ask whether one\ncan ensure each task subnetwork to be efficient during inference time while\nretaining the benefits of representation learning. To this end, we propose an\ninference-efficient variation of PackNet called Efficient Sparse PackNet (ESPN)\nwhich employs joint channel & weight pruning. ESPN embeds tasks in\nchannel-sparse subnets requiring up to 80% less FLOPs to compute while\napproximately retaining accuracy and is very competitive with a variety of\nbaselines. In summary, this work takes a step towards data and\ncompute-efficient CL with a representation learning perspective. GitHub page:\nhttps://github.com/ucr-optml/CtRL",

First, most AD methods cannot incorporate labeled data\nthat are often available in practice in small quantities and can be crucial to\nachieve high AD accuracy. Second, most AD methods are not interpretable, a\nbottleneck that prevents stakeholders from understanding the reason behind the\nanomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel AD framework that adapts a\nwhite-box model class, Generalized Additive Models, to detect anomalies using a\npartial identification objective which naturally handles noisy or heterogeneous\nfeatures. In addition, the proposed framework, DIAD, can incorporate a small\namount of labeled data to further boost anomaly detection performances in\nsemi-supervised settings. We demonstrate the superiority of our framework\ncompared to previous work in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings\nusing diverse tabular datasets.

Specifically, we show that\ndifferent data modalities (e.g. images and text) are embedded at arm's length\nin their shared representation in multi-modal models such as CLIP. Our\nsystematic analysis demonstrates that this gap is caused by a combination of\nmodel initialization and contrastive learning optimization. In model\ninitialization, we show empirically and theoretically that the representation\nof a common deep neural network is restricted to a narrow cone. As a\nconsequence, in a multi-modal model with two encoders, the representations of\nthe two modalities are clearly apart when the model is initialized. During\noptimization, contrastive learning keeps the different modalities separate by a\ncertain distance, which is influenced by the temperature parameter in the loss\nfunction.

To solve this problem, we\nintroduce a simulation to reality (sim2real) instance-level style transfer for\n6D pose estimation network training. Our approach transfers the style of target\nobjects individually, from synthetic to real, without human intervention. This\nimproves the quality of synthetic data for training pose estimation networks.\nWe also propose a complete pipeline from data collection to the training of a\npose estimation network and conduct extensive evaluation on a real-world\nrobotic platform.

Simply\nput, we compare the victim model output on the target sample versus the samples\nfrom the same subpopulation (i.e., semantically similar samples), instead of\ncomparing it with the output of hundreds of shadow models. The intuition is\nthat the model response should not be significantly different between the\ntarget sample and its subpopulation if it was not a training sample.

In this context, network traffic prediction is crucial for\noperators to provide reliable connectivity across large geographic regions.\nAlthough recent advances in neural network design have demonstrated potential\nto effectively tackle forecasting, in this work we reveal based on real-world\nmeasurements that network traffic across different regions differs widely. As a\nresult, models trained on historical traffic data observed in one region can\nhardly serve in making accurate predictions in other areas. Training bespoke\nmodels for different regions is tempting, but that approach bears significant\nmeasurement overhead, is computationally expensive, and does not scale.\nTherefore, in this paper we propose TransMUSE, a novel deep learning framework\nthat clusters similar services, groups edge-nodes into cohorts by traffic\nfeature similarity, and employs a Transformer-based Multi-service Traffic\nPrediction Network (TMTPN), which can be directly transferred within a cohort\nwithout any customization. We demonstrate that TransMUSE exhibits imperceptible\nperformance degradation in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) when forecasting\ntraffic, compared with settings where a model is trained for each individual\nedge node. Moreover, our proposed TMTPN architecture outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art, achieving up to 43.21% lower MAE in the multi-service traffic\nprediction task.

Our proposed architecture achieves significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art learning models yielding an average 46.99% improvement in\ndetection performance for combinatorial triggers and 21.91% improvement for\nsequential triggers across a variety of circuit types.

    "abstract": "High-throughput structure-based screening of drug-like molecules has become a\ncommon tool in biomedical research. Recently, acceleration with graphics\nprocessing units (GPUs) has provided a large performance boost for molecular\ndocking programs. Both cloud and high-performance computing (HPC) resources\nhave been used for large screens with molecular docking programs; while NVIDIA\nGPUs have dominated cloud and HPC resources, new vendors such as AMD and Intel\nare now entering the field, creating the problem of software portability across\ndifferent GPUs. Ideally, software productivity could be maximized with portable\nprogramming models that are able to maintain high performance across\narchitectures. While in many cases compiler directives have been used as an\neasy way to offload parallel regions of a CPU-based program to a GPU\naccelerator, they may also be an attractive programming model for providing\nportability across different GPU vendors, in which case the porting process may\nproceed in the reverse direction: from low-level, architecture-specific code to\nhigher-level directive-based abstractions. MiniMDock is a new mini-application\n(miniapp) designed to capture the essential computational kernels found in\nmolecular docking calculations, such as are used in pharmaceutical drug\ndiscovery efforts, in order to test different solutions for porting across GPU\narchitectures. Here we extend MiniMDock to GPU offloading with OpenMP\ndirectives, and compare to performance of kernels using CUDA, and HIP on both\nNVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as across different compilers, exploring\nperformance bottlenecks. We document this reverse-porting process, from highly\noptimized device code to a higher-level version using directives, compare code\nstructure, and describe barriers that were overcome in this effort.",

In particular, the stuff layouts can take amorphous shapes\nand fill up the missing regions left out by the instance layouts. We\nexperimentally compare our PLGAN with state-of-the-art layout-based models on\nthe COCO-Stuff, Visual Genome, and Landscape datasets.

Grid-forming (GFM)\ncontrols are emerging technologies that can address such stability issues.\nNumerous methodologies of GFM inverters have been presented in literature;\nhowever, their applications for WTGs have not been thoroughly explored.

A\ncomparison study for these GFM-based WTGs is then illustrated. In addition, the\nchallenges of applying these GFM controls to wind turbines are discussed,\nincluding the impact of DC-link voltage and the current saturation algorithm on\nthe GFM control performance.

In this work, we tackle this\ncategory-level object manipulation policy learning problem via imitation\nlearning in a task-agnostic manner, where we assume no handcrafted dense\nrewards but only a terminal reward. Given this novel and challenging\ngeneralizable policy learning problem, we identify several key issues that can\nfail the previous imitation learning algorithms and hinder the generalization\nto unseen instances.

    "abstract": "Pseudo-LiDAR 3D detectors have made remarkable progress in monocular 3D\ndetection by enhancing the capability of perceiving depth with depth estimation\nnetworks, and using LiDAR-based 3D detection architectures. The advanced stereo\n3D detectors can also accurately localize 3D objects. The gap in image-to-image\ngeneration for stereo views is much smaller than that in image-to-LiDAR\ngeneration. Motivated by this, we propose a Pseudo-Stereo 3D detection\nframework with three novel virtual view generation methods, including\nimage-level generation, feature-level generation, and feature-clone, for\ndetecting 3D objects from a single image. Our analysis of depth-aware learning\nshows that the depth loss is effective in only feature-level virtual view\ngeneration and the estimated depth map is effective in both image-level and\nfeature-level in our framework. We propose a disparity-wise dynamic convolution\nwith dynamic kernels sampled from the disparity feature map to filter the\nfeatures adaptively from a single image for generating virtual image features,\nwhich eases the feature degradation caused by the depth estimation errors.

It is urgent to\ndetect offensive language and curb its spread. Existing research shows that\nmethods with community structure features effectively improve the performance\nof offensive language detection. However, the existing models deal with\ncommunity structure independently, which seriously affects the effectiveness of\ndetection models. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end method based on\ncommunity structure and text features for offensive language detection\n(CT-OLD). Specifically, the community structure features are directly captured\nby the graph attention network layer, and the text embeddings are taken from\nthe last hidden layer of BERT. Attention mechanisms and position encoding are\nused to fuse these features. Meanwhile, we add user opinion to the community\nstructure for representing user features. The user opinion is represented by\nuser historical behavior information, which outperforms that represented by\ntext information. Besides the above point, the distribution of users and tweets\nis unbalanced in the popular datasets, which limits the generalization ability\nof the model. To address this issue, we construct and release a dataset with\nreasonable user distribution. Our method outperforms baselines with the F1\nscore of 89.94%.

    "abstract": "This work presents a fraud and abuse detection framework for streaming\nservices by modeling user streaming behavior. The goal is to discover anomalous\nand suspicious incidents and scale the investigation efforts by creating models\nthat characterize the user behavior. We study the use of semi-supervised as\nwell as supervised approaches for anomaly detection. In the semi-supervised\napproach, by leveraging only a set of authenticated anomaly-free data samples,\nwe show the use of one-class classification algorithms as well as autoencoder\ndeep neural networks for anomaly detection. In the supervised anomaly detection\ntask, we present a so-called heuristic-aware data labeling strategy for\ncreating labeled data samples. We carry out binary classification as well as\nmulti-class multi-label classification tasks for not only detecting the\nanomalous samples but also identifying the underlying anomaly behavior(s)\nassociated with each one. Finally, using a systematic feature importance study\nwe provide insights into the underlying set of features that characterize\ndifferent streaming fraud categories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst paper to use machine learning methods for fraud and abuse detection in\nreal-world scale streaming services.",

    "abstract": "Assistive robots for healthcare have seen a growing demand due to the great\npotential of relieving medical practitioners from routine jobs. In this paper,\nwe investigate the development of an optimization-based control framework for\nan ultrasound-guided assistive robot to perform scoliosis assessment. A\nconventional procedure for scoliosis assessment with ultrasound imaging\ntypically requires a medical practitioner to slide an ultrasound probe along a\npatient's back. To automate this type of procedure, we need to consider\nmultiple objectives, such as contact force, position, orientation, energy,\nposture, etc. To address the aforementioned components, we propose to formulate\nthe control framework design as a quadratic programming problem with each\nobjective weighed by its task priority subject to a set of equality and\ninequality constraints. In addition, as the robot needs to establish constant\ncontact with the patient during spine scanning, we incorporate variable\nimpedance regulation of the end-effector position and orientation in the\ncontrol architecture to enhance safety and stability during the physical\nhuman-robot interaction. Wherein, the variable impedance gains are retrieved by\nlearning from the medical expert's demonstrations. The proposed methodology is\nevaluated by conducting real-world experiments of autonomous scoliosis\nassessment with a robot manipulator xArm. The effectiveness is verified by the\nobtained coronal spinal images of both a phantom and a human subject.",

One such example\nof concern is Bayesian Optimization (BO), where uncertainty is multi-faceted,\nyet there only exists a limited number of works dedicated to this direction. In\nparticular, there is the work of Kirschner et al. (2020), which bridges the\nexisting literature of Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) by casting\nthe BO problem from the lens of DRO. While this work is pioneering, it\nadmittedly suffers from various practical shortcomings such as finite contexts\nassumptions, leaving behind the main question Can one devise a computationally\ntractable algorithm for solving this DRO-BO problem? In this work, we tackle\nthis question to a large degree of generality by considering robustness against\ndata-shift in $\\phi$-divergences, which subsumes many popular choices, such as\nthe $\\chi^2$-divergence, Total Variation, and the extant Kullback-Leibler (KL)\ndivergence. We show that the DRO-BO problem in this setting is equivalent to a\nfinite-dimensional optimization problem which, even in the continuous context\nsetting, can be easily implemented with provable sublinear regret bounds.

    "abstract": "3D object detection using LiDAR data is an indispensable component for\nautonomous driving systems. Yet, only a few LiDAR-based 3D object detection\nmethods leverage segmentation information to further guide the detection\nprocess. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task framework that jointly\nperforms 3D object detection and panoptic segmentation. In our method, the 3D\nobject detection backbone in Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) plane is augmented by the\ninjection of Range-View (RV) feature maps from the 3D panoptic segmentation\nbackbone. This enables the detection backbone to leverage multi-view\ninformation to address the shortcomings of each projection view. Furthermore,\nforeground semantic information is incorporated to ease the detection task by\nhighlighting the locations of each object class in the feature maps. Finally, a\nnew center density heatmap generated based on the instance-level information\nfurther guides the detection backbone by suggesting possible box center\nlocations for objects. Our method works with any BEV-based 3D object detection\nmethod, and as shown by extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, it\nprovides significant performance gains.

    "abstract": "Training the multi-label image recognition models with partial labels, in\nwhich merely some labels are known while others are unknown for each image, is\na considerably challenging and practical task. To address this task, current\nalgorithms mainly depend on pre-training classification or similarity models to\ngenerate pseudo labels for the unknown labels. However, these algorithms depend\non sufficient multi-label annotations to train the models, leading to poor\nperformance especially with low known label proportion. In this work, we\npropose to blend category-specific representation across different images to\ntransfer information of known labels to complement unknown labels, which can\nget rid of pre-training models and thus does not depend on sufficient\nannotations. To this end, we design a unified semantic-aware representation\nblending (SARB) framework that exploits instance-level and prototype-level\nsemantic representation to complement unknown labels by two complementary\nmodules: 1) an instance-level representation blending (ILRB) module blends the\nrepresentations of the known labels in an image to the representations of the\nunknown labels in another image to complement these unknown labels. 2) a\nprototype-level representation blending (PLRB) module learns more stable\nrepresentation prototypes for each category and blends the representation of\nunknown labels with the prototypes of corresponding labels to complement these\nlabels.

    "abstract": "Conversations have become a critical data format on social media platforms.\nUnderstanding conversation from emotion, content, and other aspects also\nattracts increasing attention from researchers due to its widespread\napplication in human-computer interaction. In real-world environments, we often\nencounter the problem of incomplete modalities, which has become a core issue\nof conversation understanding. To address this problem, researchers propose\nvarious methods. However, existing approaches are mainly designed for\nindividual utterances or medical images rather than conversational data, which\ncannot exploit temporal and speaker information in conversations. To this end,\nwe propose a novel framework for incomplete multimodal learning in\nconversations, called \"Graph Complete Network (GCNet)\", filling the gap of\nexisting works. Our GCNet contains two well-designed graph neural network-based\nmodules, \"Speaker GNN\" and \"Temporal GNN\", to capture temporal and speaker\ninformation in conversations. To make full use of complete and incomplete data\nin feature learning, we jointly optimize classification and reconstruction in\nan end-to-end manner. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct\nexperiments on three benchmark conversational datasets. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our GCNet is superior to existing state-of-the-art approaches\nin incomplete multimodal learning.",

    "abstract": "Modeling driver behavior provides several advantages in the automotive\nindustry, including prediction of electric vehicle energy consumption. Studies\nhave shown that aggressive driving can consume up to 30% more energy than\nmoderate driving, in certain driving scenarios. Machine learning methods are\nwidely used for driver behavior classification, which, however, may yield some\nchallenges such as sequence modeling on long time windows and lack of labeled\ndata due to expensive annotation. To address the first challenge, passive\nlearning of driver behavior, we investigate non-recurrent architectures such as\nself-attention models and convolutional neural networks with joint recurrence\nplots (JRP), and compare them with recurrent models. We find that\nself-attention models yield good performance, while JRP does not exhibit any\nsignificant improvement. However, with the window lengths of 5 and 10 seconds\nused in our study, none of the non-recurrent models outperform the recurrent\nmodels. To address the second challenge, we investigate several active learning\nmethods with different informativeness measures. We evaluate uncertainty\nsampling, as well as more advanced methods, such as query by committee and\nactive deep dropout. Our experiments demonstrate that some active sampling\ntechniques can outperform random sampling, and therefore decrease the effort\nneeded for annotation.",

To handle this\nproblem, this paper proposes \"Extract and Generate\" (EAG), a two-step approach\nto construct large-scale and high-quality multi-way aligned corpus from\nbilingual data. Specifically, we first extract candidate aligned examples by\npairing the bilingual examples from different language pairs with highly\nsimilar source or target sentences; and then generate the final aligned\nexamples from the candidates with a well-trained generation model. With this\ntwo-step pipeline, EAG can construct a large-scale and multi-way aligned corpus\nwhose diversity is almost identical to the original bilingual corpus.\nExperiments on two publicly available datasets i.e., WMT-5 and OPUS-100, show\nthat the proposed method achieves significant improvements over strong\nbaselines, with +1.1 and +1.4 BLEU points improvements on the two datasets\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses poor cluster formation and frequent Cluster Head (CH)\nfailure issues of underwater sensor networks by proposing an energy-efficient\nhierarchical topology-aware clustering routing (EEHTAC) protocol. In this\npaper, fault-tolerant backup clustering (FTBC) algorithms and multi-parameter\ncluster formation (MPCF) model were developed for the EEHTAC operation. The\nMPCF model tackles the issue of poor cluster formation performance by\nintegrating multiple parameters to achieve effective clustering process. The\nFTBC algorithms tackle the issue of frequent CH failures to avoid interruption\nin data transmission. Performance of the MPCF model was evaluated using normal,\nhigh-fault, and high routing overhead network scenarios. Performance metrics\nemployed for this analysis are temporal topology variation ratio (TTVR), CH\nload distribution (CLD), and cluster stability (STB). Obtained results show\nthat operating with a CH retention period of 90s achieves better CH duty\ncycling per round and improves the MPCF process with values of 25.69%, 55.56%,\nand 60% for TTVR, CLD, and STB respectively. Performance of the FTBC-based\nEEHTAC was evaluated relative to Energy-balanced Unequal Layering Clustering\n(EULC) protocol. Performance indicators adopted for this evaluation are routing\noverhead ({\\Omega}), end to end delay ({\\Delta}), CH failures recovered (CFR),\nCH failures detected (CFD), received packets ({\\theta}), and energy consumption\n({\\Sigma}). With reference to the best obtained values, EEHTAC demonstrated\nperformance improvement of 58.40%, 29.94%, 81.33%, 28.02%, 86.65%, and 54.35%\nover EULC variants in terms of {\\Omega}, {\\Delta}, CFR, CFD, {\\theta}, and\n{\\Sigma} respectively.

To address these issues, we\npropose a novel non-convex surrogate that can be optimized by closed-form\nsolutions, such that it empirically converges within dozens of iterations.\nBesides, the optimization is parameter-free and the convergence is proved.\nCompared with the relaxation of rank, the surrogate is motivated by optimizing\nan upper-bound of rank. We theoretically validate that it is equivalent to the\nexisting matrix completion models. Besides the low-rank assumption, we intend\nto exploit the column-wise correlation for matrix completion, and thus an\nadaptive correlation learning, which is scaling-invariant, is developed.

    "abstract": "In sponsored search advertising, advertisers need to make a series of keyword\ndecisions. Among them, how to group these keywords to form several adgroups\nwithin a campaign is a challenging task, due to the highly uncertain\nenvironment of search advertising. This paper proposes a stochastic programming\nmodel for keywords grouping, taking click-through rate and conversion rate as\nrandom variables, with consideration of budget constraints and advertisers'\nrisk-tolerance. A branch-and-bound algorithm is developed to solve our model.\nFurthermore, we conduct computational experiments to evaluate the effectiveness\nof our model and solution, with two real-world datasets collected from reports\nand logs of search advertising campaigns. Experimental results illustrated that\nour keywords grouping approach outperforms five baselines, and it can\napproximately approach the optimum in a steady way. This research generates\nseveral interesting findings that illuminate critical managerial insights for\nadvertisers in sponsored search advertising. First, keywords grouping does\nmatter for advertisers, especially in the situation with a large number of\nkeywords. Second, in keyword grouping decisions, the marginal profit does not\nnecessarily show the marginal diminishing phenomenon as the budget increases.\nSuch that, it's a worthy try for advertisers to increase their budget in\nkeywords grouping decisions, in order to obtain additional profit. Third, the\noptimal keywords grouping solution is a result of multifaceted trade-off among\nvarious advertising factors. In particular, assigning more keywords into\nadgroups or having more budget won't certainly lead to higher profits. This\nsuggests a warning for advertisers that it's not wise to take the number of\nkeywords as the criterion for keywords grouping decisions.",

    "abstract": "One main goal of argumentation theory is to evaluate arguments and to\ndetermine whether they should be accepted or rejected. When there is no clear\nanswer, a third option, being undecided, has to be taken into account.\nIndecision is often not considered explicitly, but rather taken to be a\ncollection of all unclear or troubling cases. However, current philosophy makes\na strong point for taking indecision itself to be a proper object of\nconsideration. This paper aims at revealing parallels between the findings\nconcerning indecision in philosophy and the treatment of indecision in\nargumentation theory. By investigating what philosophical forms and norms of\nindecision are involved in argumentation theory, we can improve our\nunderstanding of the different uncertain evidential situations in argumentation\ntheory.",

This\nmodel is derived from variational principles complying with the second law of\nthermodynamics in isothermal situations, starting from biological constitutive\nassumptions on the tumor cells adhesion properties and on the infiltrative\nmechanics of tumor-induced vasculature in the tumor tissues, and takes the form\nof a coupled degenerate Cahn-Hilliard Keller-Segel system for the mixture\ncomponents with reaction diffusion equations for the chemicals. The model is\ninformed by neuroimaging data, which give informations about the\npatient-specific brain geometry and tissues microstructure, the distribution of\nthe different tumor components, the white matter fiber orientations and the\nvasculature density. We describe specific and robust preprocessing steps to\nextract quantitative informations from the neuroimaging data and to construct a\ncomputational platform to solve the model on a patient-specific basis. We\nintroduce a finite element approximation of the model which preserve the\nqualitative properties of the continuous solutions. Finally, we show simulation\nresults for the patient-specific tumor evolution of a patient affected by\nGlioBlastoma Multiforme, considering two different test cases before surgery,\ncorresponding to situations with high or low nutrient supply inside the tumor,\nand a test case after surgery. We show that our model correctly predicts the\noverall extension of the tumor distribution and the intensity of the\nangiogenetic process, paving the way for assisting the clinicians in properly\nassessing the therapy outcomes and in designing optimal patient-specific\ntherapeutic schedules.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in state-only imitation learning extends the scope of\napplicability of imitation learning to real-world settings by relieving the\nneed for observing expert actions. However, existing solutions only learn to\nextract a state-to-action mapping policy from the data, without considering how\nthe expert plans to the target. This hinders the ability to leverage\ndemonstrations and limits the flexibility of the policy. In this paper, we\nintroduce Decoupled Policy Optimization (DePO), which explicitly decouples the\npolicy as a high-level state planner and an inverse dynamics model. With\nembedded decoupled policy gradient and generative adversarial training, DePO\nenables knowledge transfer to different action spaces or state transition\ndynamics, and can generalize the planner to out-of-demonstration state regions.\nOur in-depth experimental analysis shows the effectiveness of DePO on learning\na generalized target state planner while achieving the best imitation\nperformance.

    "abstract": "Battery operated devices are rapidly increasing due to the bulk usage of IoT\nenabled nodes in various fields. The alternative and promising solution to\nreplace battery-operated devices is energy harvesters, which helps to power up\nthe embedded devices. The energy harvester systematically stores sufficient\nenergy in a capacitor to power up the embedded device for computing the task.\nThis type of computation is defined as intermittent computing. Energy\nharvesters cannot ensure a continuous power supply for embedded devices. All\nregisters and cache are volatile in conventional processors. We require a\nNon-Volatile Memory (NVM) based Non-Volatile Processor (NVP), which store the\nregisters and cache contents during power failure.\nIntroducing NVM at the cache level degrades the system performance and\nconsumes more energy than SRAM based caches. In this paper, an Efficient Backup\nand Restore (eBaRe) hybrid cache architecture is proposed by integrating SRAM\nand STT-RAM at a first-level cache. The eBaRe architecture proposes cache block\nplacement and migration policies to reduce the number of writes to STT-RAM.\nDuring a power failure, the backup strategy finds the important blocks to\nmigrate from SRAM to STT-RAM. In comparison to baseline architecture, eBaRe\narchitecture reduces STT-RAM writes from 63.35\\% to 35.93\\%, resulting in a\n32.85\\% performance gain and 23.42\\% reduction in energy consumption.

    "abstract": "Given two point sets, the problem of registration is to recover a\ntransformation that matches one set to the other. This task is challenging due\nto the presence of the large number of outliers, the unknown non-rigid\ndeformations and the large sizes of point sets. To obtain strong robustness\nagainst outliers, we formulate the registration problem as a partial\ndistribution matching (PDM) problem, where the goal is to partially match the\ndistributions represented by point sets in a metric space. To handle large\npoint sets, we propose a scalable PDM algorithm by utilizing the efficient\npartial Wasserstein-1 (PW) discrepancy. Specifically, we derive the\nKantorovich-Rubinstein duality for the PW discrepancy, and show its gradient\ncan be explicitly computed. Based on these results, we propose a partial\nWasserstein adversarial network (PWAN), which is able to approximate the PW\ndiscrepancy by a neural network, and minimize it by gradient descent. In\naddition, it also incorporates an efficient coherence regularizer for non-rigid\ntransformations to avoid unrealistic deformations.

Despite being significantly faster than exact methods, the ACOs can\nstill be prohibitively slow, especially if compared to basic problem-specific\nheuristics. As recent research has shown, it is possible to significantly\nimprove the performance through algorithm refinements and careful parallel\nimplementation benefiting from multi-core CPUs and dedicated accelerators. In\nthis paper, we present a novel ACO variant, namely the Focused ACO (FACO). One\nof the core elements of the FACO is a mechanism for controlling the number of\ndifferences between a newly constructed and a selected previous solution. The\nmechanism results in a more focused search process, allowing to find\nimprovements while preserving the quality of the existing solution. An\nadditional benefit is a more efficient integration with a problem-specific\nlocal search.\nComputational study based on a range of the Traveling Salesman Problem\ninstances shows that the FACO outperforms the state-of-the-art ACOs when\nsolving large TSP instances.

Sim-to-real approaches leverage simulations to pretrain DRL policies\nand then deploy them in the real world. Unfortunately, the direct real-world\ndeployment of pretrained policies usually suffers from performance\ndeterioration due to the different dynamics, known as the reality gap. Recent\nsim-to-real methods, such as domain randomization and domain adaptation, focus\non improving the robustness of the pretrained agents.

They have complementary advantages and limitations, thereby offering\nhuge potential for improvement towards an integrated CAD modeling scheme. Some\nbelieve that their integration will be the key characteristic of next\ngeneration CAD software. This paper provides a brief review on current\nparametric/direct integration approaches. Their basic ideas, advantages, and\ndisadvantages will be discussed. The main result reads that existing\nintegration approaches are far from being completed if seamless\nparametric/direct integration is desired. It is hoped that, by outlining what\nhas already been made possible and what still remains problematic, more\nresearchers will be attracted to work on this very important research topic of\nparametric/direct integration.",

    "abstract": "Pseudo-label-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved great success\non raw data utilization. However, its training procedure suffers from\nconfirmation bias due to the noise contained in self-generated artificial\nlabels. Moreover, the model's judgment becomes noisier in real-world\napplications with extensive out-of-distribution data. To address this issue, we\npropose a general method named Class-aware Contrastive Semi-Supervised Learning\n(CCSSL), which is a drop-in helper to improve the pseudo-label quality and\nenhance the model's robustness in the real-world setting. Rather than treating\nreal-world data as a union set, our method separately handles reliable\nin-distribution data with class-wise clustering for blending into downstream\ntasks and noisy out-of-distribution data with image-wise contrastive for better\ngeneralization. Furthermore, by applying target re-weighting, we successfully\nemphasize clean label learning and simultaneously reduce noisy label learning.\nDespite its simplicity, our proposed CCSSL has significant performance\nimprovements over the state-of-the-art SSL methods on the standard datasets\nCIFAR100 and STL10.

    "abstract": "Effectively classifying remote sensing scenes is still a challenge due to the\nincreasing spatial resolution of remote imaging and large variances between\nremote sensing images. Existing research has greatly improved the performance\nof remote sensing scene classification (RSSC). However, these methods are not\napplicable to cross-domain few-shot problems where target domain is with very\nlimited training samples available and has a different data distribution from\nsource domain. To improve the model's applicability, we propose the\nfeature-wise transformation module (FTM) in this paper. FTM transfers the\nfeature distribution learned on source domain to that of target domain by a\nvery simple affine operation with negligible additional parameters. Moreover,\nFTM can be effectively learned on target domain in the case of few training\ndata available and is agnostic to specific network structures. Experiments on\nRSSC and land-cover mapping tasks verified its capability to handle\ncross-domain few-shot problems. By comparison with directly finetuning, FTM\nachieves better performance and possesses better transferability and\nfine-grained discriminability. \\textit{Code will be publicly available.}",

In practice, the problem of secure revocation is\nstill open. Furthermore, the existing procedures do not leave a transparent and\nimmutable revocation history. We propose and evaluate a new revocation\ntransparency protocol that introduces postcertificates and utilizes the\nexisting Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. The protocol is practical, has a\nlow deployment cost, provides an immutable history of revocations, enables\ndelegation, and helps to detect revocation-related misbehavior by certificate\nauthorities (CAs). With this protocol, a holder of a postcertificate can bypass\nthe issuing CA and autonomously initiate the revocation process via submission\nof the postcertificate to a CT log. The CAs are required to monitor CT logs and\nproceed with the revocation upon detection of a postcertificate. Revocation\nstatus delivery is performed independently and with an arbitrary status\nprotocol. Postcertificates can increase the accountability of the CAs and\nempower the certificate owners by giving them additional control over the\nstatus of the certificates.

Motivated by studies in linguistics, we\ndecompose the co-speech motion into two complementary parts: pose modes and\nrhythmic dynamics. Accordingly, we introduce a novel freeform motion generation\nmodel (FreeMo) by equipping a two-stream architecture, i.e., a pose mode branch\nfor primary posture generation, and a rhythmic motion branch for rhythmic\ndynamics synthesis. On one hand, diverse pose modes are generated by\nconditional sampling in a latent space, guided by speech semantics. On the\nother hand, rhythmic dynamics are synced with the speech prosody.

    "abstract": "Perching on surfaces of moving objects, like vehicles, could extend the\nflight times and range of quadrotors. For surfaces attachment, suction cups are\nusually adopted due to their durability and large adhesion force. To seal on\nsurfaces, suction cups are required to be aligned with surfaces and match to\nthe frictions on end faces induced by relative tangential velocity. However,\nwhen the object surface is moving and inclined such that an aggressive maneuver\nis required, the attitude and relative velocity errors of quadrotors would\nbecome significant, which poses challenges to perch. To address the problem, we\nproposed a real-time trajectory planning algorithm to alleviate the velocity\nerrors of quadrotors relative to moving surfaces. Multimodal search in dynamic\ntime-domain is developed in the algorithm and thus the time-optimal aggressive\ntrajectories can be efficiently generated. To further adapt to the residual\nattitude and relative velocity errors, we design a compliant gripper using\nself-sealing cups. Multiple cups in different directions are integrated into a\nwheel-like mechanism to increase the tolerance to attitude errors. The wheel\nmechanism in the gripper also eliminates the requirement of matching the\nattitude and tangential velocity and thus increases the adaptability to\ntangential velocity. Extensive tests are conducted, including comparison\nexperiments, to perch on static and moving surfaces at various inclinations.\nResults demonstrate that our proposed system enables a quadrotor to reliably\nperch on static and moving inclined (up to 1.18$m/s$ and 90$^\\circ$) surfaces\nwith a success rate of 70\\% or higher. The trajectory planner is valid and\nefficient. Compared to conventional suction cup grippers in moving surface\nperching, our gripper has larger adaptability to attitude errors and tangential\nvelocities, and the success rate increases by 45\\%.",

While they perform competitively on a number of\nevaluation categories, rare words pose a serious challenge to RNN-T models. One\nmain reason for the degradation in performance on rare words is that the\nlanguage model (LM) internal to RNN-Ts can become overconfident and lead to\nhallucinated predictions that are acoustically inconsistent with the underlying\nspeech. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight adaptive LM discounting\ntechnique AdaptLMD, that can be used with any RNN-T architecture without\nrequiring any external resources or additional parameters. AdaptLMD uses a\ntwo-pronged approach: 1) Randomly mask the prediction network output to\nencourage the RNN-T to not be overly reliant on it's outputs. 2) Dynamically\nchoose when to discount the implicit LM (ILM) based on rarity of recently\npredicted tokens and divergence between ILM and implicit acoustic model (IAM)\nscores. Comparing AdaptLMD to a competitive RNN-T baseline, we obtain up to 4%\nand 14% relative reductions in overall WER and rare word PER, respectively, on\na conversational, code-mixed Hindi-English ASR task.",

However, the current two-stage detectors are inefficient\nas they do bounding box regression in multiple steps i.e. in region proposal\nnetworks and bounding box heads.

We propose F2DNet, a novel\ntwo-stage detection architecture which eliminates redundancy of current\ntwo-stage detectors by replacing the region proposal network with our focal\ndetection network and bounding box head with our fast suppression head. We\nbenchmark F2DNet on top pedestrian detection datasets, thoroughly compare it\nagainst the existing state-of-the-art detectors and conduct cross dataset\nevaluation to test the generalizability of our model to unseen data.

    "abstract": "Search-based techniques have been widely used for white-box test generation.\nMany of these approaches rely on the approach level and branch distance\nheuristics to guide the search process and generate test cases with high line\nand branch coverage. Despite the positive results achieved by these two\nheuristics, they only use the information related to the coverage of explicit\nbranches (e.g., indicated by conditional and loop statements), but ignore\npotential implicit branchings within basic blocks of code. If such implicit\nbranching happens at runtime (e.g., if an exception is thrown in a\nbranchless-method), the existing fitness functions cannot guide the search\nprocess. To address this issue, we introduce a new secondary objective, called\nBasic Block Coverage (BBC), which takes into account the coverage level of\nrelevant basic blocks in the control flow graph. We evaluated the impact of BBC\non search-based unit test generation (using the DynaMOSA algorithm) and\nsearch-based crash reproduction (using the STDistance and WeightedSum fitness\nfunctions). Our results show that for unit test generation, BBC improves the\nbranch coverage of the generated tests. Although small (around 1.5%), this\nimprovement in the branch coverage is systematic and leads to an increase of\nthe output domain coverage and implicit runtime exception coverage, and of the\ndiversity of runtime states. In terms of crash reproduction, in the combination\nof STDistance and WeightedSum, BBC helps in reproducing 3 new crashes for each\nfitness function. BBC significantly decreases the time required to reproduce\n43.5% and 45.1% of the crashes using STDistance and WeightedSum, respectively.\nFor these crashes, BBC reduces the consumed time by 71.7% (for STDistance) and\n68.7% (for WeightedSum) on average.",

This framework can be applied to any continuous uncertainty\nmeasure, allowing straightforward identification of the best subset of\npredictions with accompanying estimated error bounds. We facilitate easy\ncomparison between uncertainty measures by constructing two evaluation metrics\nderived from Quantile Binning.

As the experimental results with a six degrees of freedom robotic arm\nshow, our system is able to successfully push objects from start to end\npositions while avoiding nearby objects. Furthermore, we evaluate our learned\npolicy in comparison to a state-of-the-art pushing controller for mobile robots\nand show that our agent performs better in terms of success rate, collisions\nwith other objects, and continuous object contact in various scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Toxicity on the Internet, such as hate speech, offenses towards particular\nusers or groups of people, or the use of obscene words, is an acknowledged\nproblem. However, there also exist other types of inappropriate messages which\nare usually not viewed as toxic, e.g. as they do not contain explicit offences.\nSuch messages can contain covered toxicity or generalizations, incite harmful\nactions (crime, suicide, drug use), provoke \"heated\" discussions. Such messages\nare often related to particular sensitive topics, e.g. on politics, sexual\nminorities, social injustice which more often than other topics, e.g. cars or\ncomputing, yield toxic emotional reactions. At the same time, clearly not all\nmessages within such flammable topics are inappropriate.\nTowards this end, in this work, we present two text collections labelled\naccording to binary notion of inapropriateness and a multinomial notion of\nsensitive topic. Assuming that the notion of inappropriateness is common among\npeople of the same culture, we base our approach on human intuitive\nunderstanding of what is not acceptable and harmful. To objectivise the notion\nof inappropriateness, we define it in a data-driven way though crowdsourcing.\nNamely we run a large-scale annotation study asking workers if a given chatbot\ntextual statement could harm reputation of a company created it. Acceptably\nhigh values of inter-annotator agreement suggest that the notion of\ninappropriateness exists and can be uniformly understood by different people.\nTo define the notion of sensitive topics in an objective way we use on\nguidelines suggested commonly by specialists of legal and PR department of a\nlarge public company as potentially harmful.",

    "abstract": "Though construction robots have drawn attention in research and practice for\ndecades, human-robot collaboration (HRC) remains important to conduct complex\nconstruction tasks. Considering its complexity and uniqueness, it is still\nunclear how HRC process will impact construction productivity. To this end, an\nagent-based (AB) multi-fidelity modeling approach is introduced to simulate and\nevaluate how HRC influences construction productivity. A high-fidelity model is\nfirst proposed for a scenario with one robot. Then, a low-fidelity model is\nestablished to extract key parameters that capture the inner relationship among\nscenarios. The multi-fidelity models work together to simulate complex\nscenarios. Simulation and experiements show that: 1) the proposed approach is\nfeasible and flexible for simulation of complex HRC processes, and can cover\nmultiple collaboration and interaction modes; 2) the influence of the\nsupplement strategy is simple when there is only one robot, where lower Check\nInterval (CI) and higher Supplement Limit (SL) will improve productivity. But\nthe influence becomes much more complicated when there are more robots due to\nthe internal competition among robots for the limited time of workers; 3) the\nproductivity per robot improves when there are more robots and workers, even if\nthe human-robot ratio remains the same; 4) introducing proactive interaction\nbetween robots and workers could improve productivity significantly, up to 22%\nin our experiments, which further depends on the supplement strategy and the\nhuman-robot ratio. Overall, this research contributes an integrated approach to\nsimulate and evaluate HRC's impacts on productivity as well as valuable\ninsights on how to optimize HRC for better performance.",

    "abstract": "In recent text-to-speech synthesis and voice conversion systems, a\nmel-spectrogram is commonly applied as an intermediate representation, and the\nnecessity for a mel-spectrogram vocoder is increasing. A mel-spectrogram\nvocoder must solve three inverse problems: recovery of the original-scale\nmagnitude spectrogram, phase reconstruction, and frequency-to-time conversion.\nA typical convolutional mel-spectrogram vocoder solves these problems jointly\nand implicitly using a convolutional neural network, including temporal\nupsampling layers, when directly calculating a raw waveform. Such an approach\nallows skipping redundant processes during waveform synthesis (e.g., the direct\nreconstruction of high-dimensional original-scale spectrograms). By contrast,\nthe approach solves all problems in a black box and cannot effectively employ\nthe time-frequency structures existing in a mel-spectrogram. We thus propose\niSTFTNet, which replaces some output-side layers of the mel-spectrogram vocoder\nwith the inverse short-time Fourier transform (iSTFT) after sufficiently\nreducing the frequency dimension using upsampling layers, reducing the\ncomputational cost from black-box modeling and avoiding redundant estimations\nof high-dimensional spectrograms. During our experiments, we applied our ideas\nto three HiFi-GAN variants and made the models faster and more lightweight with\na reasonable speech quality.

A special attention is paid to a\nreliable authentication under the real life verification conditions when the\ncodes are printed on an industrial printer and enrolled via modern mobile\nphones under regular light conditions. The theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation of authentication aspects of CDP is performed with respect to\nfour types of copy fakes from the point of view of (i) multi-class supervised\nclassification as a baseline approach and (ii) one-class classification as a\nreal-life application case.

    "abstract": "Counterfactual explanations have recently been brought to light as a\npotentially crucial response to obtaining human-understandable explanations\nfrom predictive models in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Despite\nthe fact that various counterfactual algorithms have been proposed, the state\nof the art research still lacks standardised protocols to evaluate the quality\nof counterfactual explanations. In this work, we conducted a benchmark\nevaluation across different model agnostic counterfactual algorithms in the\nliterature (DiCE, WatcherCF, prototype, unjustifiedCF), and we investigated the\ncounterfactual generation process on different types of machine learning models\nranging from a white box (decision tree) to a grey-box (random forest) and a\nblack box (neural network). We evaluated the different counterfactual\nalgorithms using several metrics including proximity, interpretability and\nfunctionality for five datasets. The main findings of this work are the\nfollowing: (1) without guaranteeing plausibility in the counterfactual\ngeneration process, one cannot have meaningful evaluation results. This means\nthat all explainable counterfactual algorithms that do not take into\nconsideration plausibility in their internal mechanisms cannot be evaluated\nwith the current state of the art evaluation metrics; (2) the counterfactual\ngenerated are not impacted by the different types of machine learning models;\n(3) DiCE was the only tested algorithm that was able to generate actionable and\nplausible counterfactuals, because it provides mechanisms to constraint\nfeatures; (4) WatcherCF and UnjustifiedCF are limited to continuous variables\nand can not deal with categorical data.",

Unlike state-of-the-art segmentation-based and point\ndetection-based methods that typically require heuristics to either decode\npredictions or formulate a large sum of anchors, the curve-based methods can\nlearn holistic lane representations naturally. To handle the optimization\ndifficulties of existing polynomial curve methods, we propose to exploit the\nparametric B\\'ezier curve due to its ease of computation, stability, and high\nfreedom degrees of transformations. In addition, we propose the deformable\nconvolution-based feature flip fusion, for exploiting the symmetry properties\nof lanes in driving scenes. The proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art\nperformance on the popular LLAMAS benchmark. It also achieves favorable\naccuracy on the TuSimple and CULane datasets, while retaining both low latency\n(> 150 FPS) and small model size (< 10M). Our method can serve as a new\nbaseline, to shed the light on the parametric curves modeling for lane\ndetection.

    "abstract": "In a co-simulation context, interconnected systems of differential equations\nare solved separately but they regularly communicate data to one another during\nthese resolutions. Iterative co-simulation methods have been developed in order\nto enhance both stability and accuracy. Such methods imply that the systems\nmust integrate one or more times per co-simulation step (the interval between\ntwo consecutive communications) in order to find the best satisfying interface\nvalues for exchanged data (according to a given coupling constraint). This\nrequires that every system involved in the modular model is capable of\nrollback: the ability to re-integrate a time interval that has already been\nintegrated with different input commands. In a paper previously introduced by\nEguillon et al. in 2022, the COSTARICA process is presented and consists in\nreplacing the non-rollback-capable systems by an estimator on the non-last\nintegrations of the iterative process. The MISSILES algorithm, introduced in\nthis paper, consists in applying the COSTARICA process on every system of a\nmodular model simulated with the IFOSMONDI-JFM iterative co-simulation method\n(introduced by Eguillon et al. in 2021). Indeed, in this case, the iterative\npart on the estimators of each system can be avoided as the global resolution\non a co-simulation step can be written as a single global linear system to\nsolve. Consequently, MISSILES is a non-iterative method that leads to the same\nsolution than the IFOSMONDI-JFM iterative co-simulation method applied to\nsystems using the COSTARICA process to emulate the rollback.",

    "abstract": "Given a deep learning model trained on data from a source site, how to deploy\nthe model to a target hospital automatically? How to accommodate heterogeneous\nmedical coding systems across different hospitals? Standard approaches rely on\nexisting medical code mapping tools, which have significant practical\nlimitations.\nTo tackle this problem, we propose AutoMap to automatically map the medical\ncodes across different EHR systems in a coarse-to-fine manner: (1)\nOntology-level Alignment: We leverage the ontology structure to learn a coarse\nalignment between the source and target medical coding systems; (2) Code-level\nRefinement: We refine the alignment at a fine-grained code level for the\ndownstream tasks using a teacher-student framework.\nWe evaluate AutoMap using several deep learning models with two real-world\nEHR datasets: eICU and MIMIC-III. Results show that AutoMap achieves relative\nimprovements up to 3.9% (AUC-ROC) and 8.7% (AUC-PR) for mortality prediction,\nand up to 4.7% (AUC-ROC) and 3.7% (F1) for length-of-stay estimation. Further,\nwe show that AutoMap can provide accurate mapping across coding systems.\nLastly, we demonstrate that AutoMap can adapt to the two challenging scenarios:\n(1) mapping between completely different coding systems and (2) between\ncompletely different hospitals.",

    "title": "Real-Time Hybrid Mapping of Populated Indoor Scenes using a Low-Cost  Monocular UAV",
    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used for many applications in\nrecent years, from urban search and rescue, to agricultural surveying, to\nautonomous underground mine exploration. However, deploying UAVs in tight,\nindoor spaces, especially close to humans, remains a challenge. One solution,\nwhen limited payload is required, is to use micro-UAVs, which pose less risk to\nhumans and typically cost less to replace after a crash. However, micro-UAVs\ncan only carry a limited sensor suite, e.g. a monocular camera instead of a\nstereo pair or LiDAR, complicating tasks like dense mapping and markerless\nmulti-person 3D human pose estimation, which are needed to operate in tight\nenvironments around people. Monocular approaches to such tasks exist, and dense\nmonocular mapping approaches have been successfully deployed for UAV\napplications. However, despite many recent works on both marker-based and\nmarkerless multi-UAV single-person motion capture, markerless single-camera\nmulti-person 3D human pose estimation remains a much earlier-stage technology,\nand we are not aware of existing attempts to deploy it in an aerial context. In\nthis paper, we present what is thus, to our knowledge, the first system to\nperform simultaneous mapping and multi-person 3D human pose estimation from a\nmonocular camera mounted on a single UAV. In particular, we show how to loosely\ncouple state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation and monocular 3D human pose\nestimation approaches to reconstruct a hybrid map of a populated indoor scene\nin real time. We validate our component-level design choices via extensive\nexperiments on the large-scale ScanNet and GTA-IM datasets. To evaluate our\nsystem-level performance, we also construct a new Oxford Hybrid Mapping dataset\nof populated indoor scenes.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a unified framework for constructing spectrally\nequivalent low-order-refined discretizations for the high-order finite element\nde Rham complex. This theory covers diffusion problems in $H^1$, $H({\\rm\ncurl})$, and $H({\\rm div})$, and is based on combining a low-order\ndiscretization posed on a refined mesh with a high-order basis for N\\'ed\\'elec\nand Raviart-Thomas elements that makes use of the concept of polynomial\nhistopolation (polynomial fitting using prescribed mean values over certain\nregions). This spectral equivalence, coupled with algebraic multigrid methods\nconstructed using the low-order discretization, results in highly scalable\nmatrix-free preconditioners for high-order finite element problems in the full\nde Rham complex. Additionally, a new lowest-order (piecewise constant)\npreconditioner is developed for high-order interior penalty discontinuous\nGalerkin (DG) discretizations, for which spectral equivalence results and\nconvergence proofs for algebraic multigrid methods are provided. In all cases,\nthe spectral equivalence results are independent of polynomial degree and mesh\nsize; for DG methods, they are also independent of the penalty parameter. These\nnew solvers are flexible and easy to use; any \"black-box\" preconditioner for\nlow-order problems can be used to create an effective and efficient\npreconditioner for the corresponding high-order problem. A number of numerical\nexperiments are presented, based on an implmentation in the finite element\nlibrary MFEM. The theoretical properties of these preconditioners are\ncorroborated, and the flexibility and scalability of the method are\ndemonstrated on a range of challenging three-dimensional problems.",

    "abstract": "Multi-robot assembly systems are becoming increasingly appealing in\nmanufacturing due to their ability to automatically, flexibly, and quickly\nconstruct desired structural designs. However, effectively planning for these\nsystems in a manner that ensures each robot is simultaneously productive, and\nnot idle, is challenging due to (1) the close proximity that the robots must\noperate in to manipulate the structure and (2) the inherent structural partial\norderings on when each part can be installed. In this paper, we present a task\nand motion planning framework that jointly plans safe, low-makespan plans for a\nteam of robots to assemble complex spatial structures. Our framework takes a\nhierarchical approach that, at the high level, uses Mixed-integer Linear\nPrograms to compute an abstract plan comprised of an allocation of robots to\ntasks subject to precedence constraints and, at the low level, builds on a\nstate-of-the-art algorithm for Multi-Agent Path Finding to plan collision-free\nrobot motions that realize this abstract plan. Critical to our approach is the\ninclusion of certain collision constraints and movement durations during\nhigh-level planning, which better informs the search for abstract plans that\nare likely to be both feasible and low-makespan while keeping the search\ntractable. We demonstrate our planning system on several challenging assembly\ndomains with several (sometimes heterogeneous) robots with grippers or suction\nplates for assembling structures with up to 23 objects involving Lego bricks,\nbars, plates, or irregularly shaped blocks.",

Our analysis demonstrates\nthat a UCCA with a larger antenna element spacing is capable of generating a\nsignificantly narrower beam with a moderate side-lobe level than a rectangular\nplanar antenna (RPA) array while operating with the same number of antenna\nelements. This capability of the UCCA is analyzed to discover the performance\ngain of a 5G network.",

A\nworst-case end-to-end delay in such networks can be computed using Network\nCalculus (NC), an algebraic theory where traffic and service guarantees are\nrepresented as curves in a Cartesian plane. NC uses transformation operations,\ne.g., the min-plus convolution, to model how the traffic profile changes with\nthe traversal of network nodes. NC allows one to model flow-controlled systems,\nhence one can compute the end-to-end service curve describing the minimum\nservice guaranteed to a flow traversing a tandem of flow-controlled nodes.\nHowever, while the algebraic expression of such an end-to-end service curve is\nquite compact, its computation is often untractable from an algorithmic\nstandpoint: data structures tend to explode, making operations unfeasibly\ncomplex, even with as few as three hops. In this paper, we propose\ncomputational and algebraic techniques to mitigate the above problem. We show\nthat existing techniques (such as reduction to compact domains) cannot be used\nin this case, and propose an arsenal of solutions, which include methods to\nmitigate the data representation space explosion as well as computationally\nefficient algorithms for the min-plus convolution operation.

Existing pansharpening\napproaches neglect using an attention mechanism to transfer HR texture features\nfrom PAN to LR-HSI features, resulting in spatial and spectral distortions. In\nthis paper, we present a novel attention mechanism for pansharpening called\nHyperTransformer, in which features of LR-HSI and PAN are formulated as queries\nand keys in a transformer, respectively. HyperTransformer consists of three\nmain modules, namely two separate feature extractors for PAN and HSI, a\nmulti-head feature soft attention module, and a spatial-spectral feature fusion\nmodule. Such a network improves both spatial and spectral quality measures of\nthe pansharpened HSI by learning cross-feature space dependencies and\nlong-range details of PAN and LR-HSI. Furthermore, HyperTransformer can be\nutilized across multiple spatial scales at the backbone for obtaining improved\nperformance.

Hence, recent articles have exploited Transformer\nvariants for medical image segmentation tasks which open up great opportunities\ndue to their innate capability of capturing long-range correlations through the\nattention mechanism. Although being feasibly designed, most of the cohort\nstudies incur prohibitive performance in capturing local information, thereby\nresulting in less lucidness of boundary areas. In this paper, we propose a\ncontextual attention network to tackle the aforementioned limitations. The\nproposed method uses the strength of the Transformer module to model the\nlong-range contextual dependency. Simultaneously, it utilizes the CNN encoder\nto capture local semantic information. In addition, an object-level\nrepresentation is included to model the regional interaction map. The extracted\nhierarchical features are then fed to the contextual attention module to\nadaptively recalibrate the representation space using the local information.\nThen, they emphasize the informative regions while taking into account the\nlong-range contextual dependency derived by the Transformer module.

To improve the\naccuracy of voltage prediction at extreme ranges, we introduce a second\n(enhanced) DNN to mitigate the prediction errors carried from the 0D model\nitself and call the resulting approach enhanced PCDNN (ePCDNN). By comparing\nthe model prediction with experimental data, we demonstrate that the ePCDNN\napproach can accurately capture the voltage response throughout the\ncharge--discharge cycle, including the tail region of the voltage discharge\ncurve. Compared to the standard PCDNN, the prediction accuracy of the ePCDNN is\nsignificantly improved. The loss function for training the ePCDNN is designed\nto be flexible by adjusting the weights of the physics-constrained DNN and the\nenhanced DNN. This allows the ePCDNN framework to be transferable to battery\nsystems with variable physical model fidelity.",

    "abstract": "Spectral clustering is widely used in practice due to its flexibility,\ncomputational efficiency, and well-understood theoretical performance\nguarantees. Recently, spectral clustering has been studied to find balanced\nclusters under population-level constraints. These constraints are specified by\nadditional information available in the form of auxiliary categorical node\nattributes. In this paper, we consider a scenario where these attributes may\nnot be observable, but manifest as latent features of an auxiliary graph.\nMotivated by this, we study constrained spectral clustering with the aim of\nfinding balanced clusters in a given \\textit{similarity graph} $\\mathcal{G}$,\nsuch that each individual is adequately represented with respect to an\nauxiliary graph $\\mathcal{R}$ (we refer to this as representation graph). We\npropose an individual-level balancing constraint that formalizes this idea. Our\nwork leads to an interesting stochastic block model that not only plants the\ngiven partitions in $\\mathcal{G}$ but also plants the auxiliary information\nencoded in the representation graph $\\mathcal{R}$. We develop unnormalized and\nnormalized variants of spectral clustering in this setting. These algorithms\nuse $\\mathcal{R}$ to find clusters in $\\mathcal{G}$ that approximately satisfy\nthe proposed constraint. We also establish the first statistical consistency\nresult for constrained spectral clustering under individual-level constraints\nfor graphs sampled from the above-mentioned variant of the stochastic block\nmodel.

A reliable\nlocalization and measure of cerebellar damage is fundamental to study the\nrelationship between the damaged cerebellar regions and postoperative\nneurological outcomes.

Next, the cerebellum is isolated by nonlinear\nregistration of a whole brain template to the native space.

Finally, the\ndamage is detected in the atlas space by comparing the normalized cerebellum\nand the SUIT template. We evaluated our damage detection tool on postoperative\nscans of 153 patients diagnosed with medulloblastoma based on inspection by\nhuman expects.

This is particularly problematic for\nthe typically large and highly heterogeneous background class in medical image\nsegmentation problems. Previous works have attempted to address this issue by\nlearning additional prototypes for each class, but since the prototypes are\nbased on a limited number of slices, we argue that this ad-hoc solution is\ninsufficient to capture the background properties. Motivated by this, and the\nobservation that the foreground class (e.g., one organ) is relatively\nhomogeneous, we propose a novel anomaly detection-inspired approach to few-shot\nmedical image segmentation in which we refrain from modeling the background\nexplicitly. Instead, we rely solely on a single foreground prototype to compute\nanomaly scores for all query pixels. The segmentation is then performed by\nthresholding these anomaly scores using a learned threshold. Assisted by a\nnovel self-supervision task that exploits the 3D structure of medical images\nthrough supervoxels, our proposed anomaly detection-inspired few-shot medical\nimage segmentation model outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on\ntwo representative MRI datasets for the tasks of abdominal organ segmentation\nand cardiac segmentation.",

Our model building has to address the following\nchallenges. Firstly, while it is ideal to learn such a model from a\nlarge-scale, fully-annotated dataset, it is practically hard to curate such a\ndataset. Thus, we resort to learn from a union of multiple datasets, with each\ndataset containing the images that are partially labeled. Secondly, along the\nline of partial labelling, we contribute an open-source, large-scale vertebra\nsegmentation dataset for the benefit of spine analysis community, CTSpine1K,\nboasting over 1,000 3D volumes and over 11K annotated vertebrae. Thirdly, in a\n3D medical image segmentation task, due to the limitation of GPU memory, we\nalways train a model using cropped patches as inputs instead a whole 3D volume,\nwhich limits the amount of contextual information to be learned. To this, we\npropose a cross-patch transformer module to fuse more information in adjacent\npatches, which enlarges the aggregated receptive field for improved\nsegmentation performance. This is especially important for segmenting, say, the\nelongated spine. Based on 7 partially labeled datasets that collectively\ncontain about 2,800 3D volumes, we successfully learn such a universal model.\nFinally, we evaluate the universal model on multiple open-source datasets,\nproving that our model has a good generalization performance and can\npotentially serve as a solid foundation for downstream tasks.",

In other words, new datasets with annotations of new organ\ncategories are built over time. To unleash the potential behind these partially\nlabeled, sequentially-constructed datasets, we propose to incrementally learn a\nmulti-organ segmentation model.

While IL is notorious for its\n`catastrophic forgetting' weakness in the context of natural image analysis, we\nexperimentally discover that such a weakness mostly disappears for CT\nmulti-organ segmentation. To further stabilize the model performance across the\nIL stages, we introduce a light memory module and some loss functions to\nrestrain the representation of different categories in feature space,\naggregating feature representation of the same class and separating feature\nrepresentation of different classes.

Existing bias mitigation methods primarily focus on learning\ndebiased models, which may not necessarily guarantee all sensitive information\ncan be removed and usually comes with considerable accuracy degradation on both\nprivileged and unprivileged groups. To tackle this issue, we propose a method,\nFairPrune, that achieves fairness by pruning. Conventionally, pruning is used\nto reduce the model size for efficient inference. However, we show that pruning\ncan also be a powerful tool to achieve fairness. Our observation is that during\npruning, each parameter in the model has different importance for different\ngroups' accuracy. By pruning the parameters based on this importance\ndifference, we can reduce the accuracy difference between the privileged group\nand the unprivileged group to improve fairness without a large accuracy drop.\nTo this end, we use the second derivative of the parameters of a pre-trained\nmodel to quantify the importance of each parameter with respect to the model\naccuracy for each group. Experiments on two skin lesion diagnosis datasets over\nmultiple sensitive attributes demonstrate that our method can greatly improve\nfairness while keeping the average accuracy of both groups as high as possible.",

    "abstract": "Robotic-assisted surgery allows surgeons to conduct precise surgical\noperations with stereo vision and flexible motor control. However, the lack of\n3D spatial perception limits situational awareness during procedures and\nhinders mastering surgical skills in the narrow abdominal space. Depth\nestimation, as a representative perception task, is typically defined as an\nimage reconstruction problem. In this work, we show that depth estimation can\nbe reformed from a 3D surface perspective. We propose a loss function for depth\nestimation that integrates the surface-aware constraints, leading to a faster\nand better convergence with the valid information from spatial information. In\naddition, camera parameters are incorporated into the training pipeline to\nincrease the control and transparency of the depth estimation. We also\nintegrate a specularity removal module to recover more buried image\ninformation. Quantitative experimental results on endoscopic datasets and user\nstudies with medical professionals demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of deep learning provides a better solution for the\nend-to-end reconstruction of hyperspectral image (HSI). However, existing\nlearning-based methods have two major defects. Firstly, networks with\nself-attention usually sacrifice internal resolution to balance model\nperformance against complexity, losing fine-grained high-resolution (HR)\nfeatures. Secondly, even if the optimization focusing on spatial-spectral\ndomain learning (SDL) converges to the ideal solution, there is still a\nsignificant visual difference between the reconstructed HSI and the truth.\nTherefore, we propose a high-resolution dual-domain learning network (HDNet)\nfor HSI reconstruction. On the one hand, the proposed HR spatial-spectral\nattention module with its efficient feature fusion provides continuous and fine\npixel-level features. On the other hand, frequency domain learning (FDL) is\nintroduced for HSI reconstruction to narrow the frequency domain discrepancy.\nDynamic FDL supervision forces the model to reconstruct fine-grained\nfrequencies and compensate for excessive smoothing and distortion caused by\npixel-level losses. The HR pixel-level attention and frequency-level refinement\nin our HDNet mutually promote HSI perceptual quality. Extensive quantitative\nand qualitative evaluation experiments show that our method achieves SOTA\nperformance on simulated and real HSI datasets. Code and models will be\nreleased.",

Firstly,\nthe quantization in LIC is considered as a generalized channel with additive\nuniform noise.

Furthermore, a unified transform method based on\nsignal modulation (TSM) is defined. In the view of TSM, the existing\ntransformation methods are mathematically reduced to a linear modulation. A\nseries of transformation methods, e.g. TPM and TJM, are obtained by extending\nto nonlinear modulation. The experimental results on various datasets and\nbackbone architectures verify that the effectiveness and robustness of the\nproposed method.

By using a Lyapunov approach, we prove exponential stability of the\nequilibrium corresponding to agents' estimates being consensual to the optimal\nsolution of the problem, with arbitrary initialization of the local estimates.\nThen, we propose two triggered versions of the algorithm. In the first one, the\nagents continuously integrate their local dynamics and exchange with neighbors\ncurrent local variables according to a synchronous communication protocol. In\nAsynchronous Triggered Gradient Tracking, we propose a totally asynchronous\nscheme in which each agent sends to neighbors its current local variables based\non a triggering condition that depends on a locally verifiable condition. The\ntriggering protocol preserves the linear convergence of the algorithm and\nexcludes the Zeno behavior. By using the stability analysis of Continuous\nGradient Tracking as a preparatory result, we show exponential stability of the\nequilibrium point holds for both triggered algorithms and any estimates'\ninitialization.

However, most neural\nnetwork-based methods perform point estimation, i.e., their output consists of\na single mask. In this paper, we study the benefits of modeling uncertainty in\nneural network-based speech enhancement. For this, our neural network is\ntrained to map a noisy spectrogram to the Wiener filter and its associated\nvariance, which quantifies uncertainty, based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP)\ninference of spectral coefficients. By estimating the distribution instead of\nthe point estimate, one can model the uncertainty associated with each\nestimate. We further propose to use the estimated Wiener filter and its\nuncertainty to build an approximate MAP (A-MAP) estimator of spectral\nmagnitudes, which in turn is combined with the MAP inference of spectral\ncoefficients to form a hybrid loss function to jointly reinforce the\nestimation. Experimental results on different datasets show that the proposed\nmethod can not only capture the uncertainty associated with the estimated\nfilters, but also yield a higher enhancement performance over comparable models\nthat do not take uncertainty into account.",

    "title": "Constructive Post-Quantum Reductions",
    "abstract": "Is it possible to convert classical cryptographic reductions into\npost-quantum ones? It is customary to argue that while this is problematic in\nthe interactive setting, non-interactive reductions do carry over. However,\nwhen considering quantum auxiliary input, this conversion results in a\nnon-constructive post-quantum reduction that requires duplicating the quantum\nauxiliary input, which is in general inefficient or even impossible. This\nviolates the win-win premise of provable cryptography: an attack against a\ncryptographic primitive should lead to an algorithmic advantage.\nWe initiate the study of constructive quantum reductions and present positive\nand negative results for converting large classes of classical reductions to\nthe post-quantum setting in a constructive manner. We show that any\nnon-interactive non-adaptive reduction from assumptions with a polynomial\nsolution space (such as decision assumptions) can be made post-quantum\nconstructive. In contrast, assumptions with super-polynomial solution space\n(such as general search assumptions) cannot be generally converted.\nAlong the way, we make several additional contributions:\n1. We put forth a framework for reductions (or general interaction) with\nstateful solvers for a computational problem, that may change their internal\nstate between consecutive calls. We show that such solvers can still be\nutilized. This framework and our results are meaningful even in the classical\nsetting.\n2. A consequence of our negative result is that quantum auxiliary input that\nis useful against a problem with a super-polynomial solution space cannot be\ngenerically ``restored'' post-measurement. This shows that the novel rewinding\ntechnique of Chiesa et al. (FOCS 2021) is tight in the sense that it cannot be\nextended beyond a polynomial measurement space.",

    "abstract": "Auditory stimulation of EEG slow waves (SW) during non-rapid eye movement\n(NREM) sleep has shown to improve cognitive function when it is delivered at\nthe up-phase of SW. SW enhancement is particularly desirable in subjects with\nlow-amplitude SW such as older adults or patients suffering from\nneurodegeneration such as Parkinson disease (PD). However, existing algorithms\nto estimate the up-phase suffer from a poor phase accuracy at low EEG\namplitudes and when SW frequencies are not constant. We introduce two novel\nalgorithms for real-time EEG phase estimation on autonomous wearable devices.\nThe algorithms were based on a phase-locked loop (PLL) and, for the first time,\na phase vocoder (PV). We compared these phase tracking algorithms with a simple\namplitude threshold approach. The optimized algorithms were benchmarked for\nphase accuracy, the capacity to estimate phase at SW amplitudes between 20 and\n60 microV, and SW frequencies above 1 Hz on 324 recordings from healthy older\nadults and PD patients. Furthermore, the algorithms were implemented on a\nwearable device and the computational efficiency and the performance was\nevaluated on simulated sleep EEG, as well as prospectively during a recording\nwith a PD patient. All three algorithms delivered more than 70% of the\nstimulation triggers during the SW up-phase. The PV showed the highest capacity\non targeting low-amplitude SW and SW with frequencies above 1 Hz. The testing\non real-time hardware revealed that both PV and PLL have marginal impact on\nmicrocontroller load, while the efficiency of the PV was 4% lower than the PLL.\nActive auditory stimulation did not influence the phase tracking.

    "abstract": "Automated surface segmentation of retinal layer is important and challenging\nin analyzing optical coherence tomography (OCT). Recently, many deep learning\nbased methods have been developed for this task and yield remarkable\nperformance. However, due to large spatial gap and potential mismatch between\nthe B-scans of OCT data, all of them are based on 2D segmentation of individual\nB-scans, which may loss the continuity information across the B-scans. In\naddition, 3D surface of the retina layers can provide more diagnostic\ninformation, which is crucial in quantitative image analysis. In this study, a\nnovel framework based on hybrid 2D-3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is\nproposed to obtain continuous 3D retinal layer surfaces from OCT. The 2D\nfeatures of individual B-scans are extracted by an encoder consisting of 2D\nconvolutions. These 2D features are then used to produce the alignment\ndisplacement field and layer segmentation by two 3D decoders, which are coupled\nvia a spatial transformer module. The entire framework is trained end-to-end.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that attempts 3D retinal\nlayer segmentation in volumetric OCT images based on CNNs. Experiments on a\npublicly available dataset show that our framework achieves superior results to\nstate-of-the-art 2D methods in terms of both layer segmentation accuracy and\ncross-B-scan 3D continuity, thus offering more clinical values than previous\nworks.",

In this context, recent\nyears have witnessed the development of various generalization bounds\nsuggesting different complexity notions such as the mutual information between\nthe data sample and the algorithm output, compressibility of the hypothesis\nspace, and the fractal dimension of the hypothesis space. While these bounds\nhave illuminated the problem at hand from different angles, their suggested\ncomplexity notions might appear seemingly unrelated, thereby restricting their\nhigh-level impact. In this study, we prove novel generalization bounds through\nthe lens of rate-distortion theory, and explicitly relate the concepts of\nmutual information, compressibility, and fractal dimensions in a single\nmathematical framework. Our approach consists of (i) defining a generalized\nnotion of compressibility by using source coding concepts, and (ii) showing\nthat the `compression error rate' can be linked to the generalization error\nboth in expectation and with high probability. We show that in the `lossless\ncompression' setting, we recover and improve existing mutual information-based\nbounds, whereas a `lossy compression' scheme allows us to link generalization\nto the rate-distortion dimension -- a particular notion of fractal dimension.\nOur results bring a more unified perspective on generalization and open up\nseveral future research directions.",
