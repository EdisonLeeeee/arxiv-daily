    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has been intensively investigated and developed in\nartificial intelligence in the absence of training data, such as autonomous\ndriving vehicles, robot control, internet advertising, and elastic optical\nnetworks. However, the computational cost of reinforcement learning with deep\nneural networks is extremely high and reducing the learning cost is a\nchallenging issue. We propose a photonic on-line implementation of\nreinforcement learning using optoelectronic delay-based reservoir computing,\nboth experimentally and numerically. In the proposed scheme, we accelerate\nreinforcement learning at a rate of several megahertz because there is no\nrequired learning process for the internal connection weights in reservoir\ncomputing. We perform two benchmark tasks, CartPole-v0 and MountanCar-v0 tasks,\nto evaluate the proposed scheme. Our results represent the first hardware\nimplementation of reinforcement learning based on photonic reservoir computing\nand pave the way for fast and efficient reinforcement learning as a novel\nphotonic accelerator.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates robot manipulation based on human instruction with\nambiguous requests. The intent is to compensate for imperfect natural language\nvia visual observations. Early symbolic methods, based on manually defined\nsymbols, built modular framework consist of semantic parsing and task planning\nfor producing sequences of actions from natural language requests. Modern\nconnectionist methods employ deep neural networks to automatically learn visual\nand linguistic features and map to a sequence of low-level actions, in an\nendto-end fashion. These two approaches are blended to create a hybrid, modular\nframework: it formulates instruction following as symbolic goal learning via\ndeep neural networks followed by task planning via symbolic planners.\nConnectionist and symbolic modules are bridged with Planning Domain Definition\nLanguage. The vision-and-language learning network predicts its goal\nrepresentation, which is sent to a planner for producing a task-completing\naction sequence. For improving the flexibility of natural language, we further\nincorporate implicit human intents with explicit human instructions. To learn\ngeneric features for vision and language, we propose to separately pretrain\nvision and language encoders on scene graph parsing and semantic textual\nsimilarity tasks. Benchmarking evaluates the impacts of different components\nof, or options for, the vision-and-language learning model and shows the\neffectiveness of pretraining strategies. Manipulation experiments conducted in\nthe simulator AI2THOR show the robustness of the framework to novel scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Attempts to computationally simulate the acquisition of spoken language via\ngrounding in perception have a long tradition but have gained momentum in the\npast few years. Current neural approaches exploit associations between the\nspoken and visual modality and learn to represent speech and visual data in a\njoint vector space. A major unresolved issue from the point of ecological\nvalidity is the training data, typically consisting of images or videos paired\nwith spoken descriptions of what is depicted. Such a setup guarantees an\nunrealistically strong correlation between speech and the visual world. In the\nreal world the coupling between the linguistic and the visual is loose, and\noften contains confounds in the form of correlations with non-semantic aspects\nof the speech signal. The current study is a first step towards simulating a\nnaturalistic grounding scenario by using a dataset based on the children's\ncartoon Peppa Pig. We train a simple bi-modal architecture on the portion of\nthe data consisting of naturalistic dialog between characters, and evaluate on\nsegments containing descriptive narrations.

It can be potentially employed in\nthe field of art creation, data augmentation, photo-editing, etc. Although many\nefforts have been dedicated to this task, it remains particularly challenging\nto generate believable, natural scenes. To facilitate the real-world\napplications of text-to-image synthesis, we focus on studying the following\nthree issues: 1) How to ensure that generated samples are believable, realistic\nor natural? 2) How to exploit the latent space of the generator to edit a\nsynthesized image? 3) How to improve the explainability of a text-to-image\ngeneration framework? In this work, we constructed two novel data sets (i.e.,\nthe Good & Bad bird and face data sets) consisting of successful as well as\nunsuccessful generated samples, according to strict criteria. To effectively\nand efficiently acquire high-quality images by increasing the probability of\ngenerating Good latent codes, we use a dedicated Good/Bad classifier for\ngenerated images. It is based on a pre-trained front end and fine-tuned on the\nbasis of the proposed Good & Bad data set. After that, we present a novel\nalgorithm which identifies semantically-understandable directions in the latent\nspace of a conditional text-to-image GAN architecture by performing independent\ncomponent analysis on the pre-trained weight values of the generator.\nFurthermore, we develop a background-flattening loss (BFL), to improve the\nbackground appearance in the edited image.

In this paper, we fill this gap by studying the model\nattribution problem of Deepfake videos. We first introduce a new dataset with\nDeepFakes from Different Models (DFDM) based on several Autoencoder models.\nSpecifically, five generation models with variations in encoder, decoder,\nintermediate layer, input resolution, and compression ratio have been used to\ngenerate a total of 6,450 Deepfake videos based on the same input.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) which extract specialized\nhardware-aware configurations (a.k.a. \"sub-networks\") from a hardware-agnostic\n\"super-network\" have become increasingly popular. While considerable effort has\nbeen employed towards improving the first stage, namely, the training of the\nsuper-network, the search for derivative high-performing sub-networks is still\nlargely under-explored. For example, some recent network morphism techniques\nallow a super-network to be trained once and then have hardware-specific\nnetworks extracted from it as needed. These methods decouple the super-network\ntraining from the sub-network search and thus decrease the computational burden\nof specializing to different hardware platforms. We propose a comprehensive\nsystem that automatically and efficiently finds sub-networks from a pre-trained\nsuper-network that are optimized to different performance metrics and hardware\nconfigurations. By combining novel search tactics and algorithms with\nintelligent use of predictors, we significantly decrease the time needed to\nfind optimal sub-networks from a given super-network. Further, our approach\ndoes not require the super-network to be refined for the target task a priori,\nthus allowing it to interface with any super-network. We demonstrate through\nextensive experiments that our system works seamlessly with existing\nstate-of-the-art super-network training methods in multiple domains. Moreover,\nwe show how novel search tactics paired with evolutionary algorithms can\naccelerate the search process for ResNet50, MobileNetV3 and Transformer while\nmaintaining objective space Pareto front diversity and demonstrate an 8x faster\nsearch result than the state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization WeakNAS approach.",

It suggests a novel method to study\ntopical variation in individuals' language when interacting with different\naudiences. Comments posted in 2020 were collected from three parenting\nsubreddits, described as being for fathers (r/Daddit), mothers (r/Mommit), and\nall parents (r/Parenting). Users posting on r/Parenting and r/Daddit or on\nr/Parenting and r/Mommit were assumed to identify as fathers or mothers,\nrespectively, allowing gender comparison. Users' comments on r/Parenting (to a\nmixed-gender audience) were compared with their comments to single-gender\naudiences on r/Daddit or r/Mommit using LDA topic modelling. Results showed\nthat the most discussed topic among parents is about education and family\nadvice, a topic mainly discussed in the mixed-gender subreddit and more by\nfathers than mothers. Regarding the basic needs of children (sleep, food, and\nmedical care), mothers seemed to be more concerned regardless of the audience.\nIn contrast, topics such as birth and pregnancy announcements and physical\nappearance were more discussed by fathers in the father-centric subreddit.\nOverall, findings seem to show that mothers are generally more concerned about\nthe practical sides of parenting while fathers' expressed concerns are more\ncontextual: with other fathers, there seems to be a desire to show their\nfatherhood and be recognized for it while they discuss education with mothers.\nThese results demonstrate that concerns expressed by parents on Reddit are\ncontext-sensitive but also consistent with gender stereotypes, potentially\nreflecting a persistent gendered and unequal division of labour in parenting.",

We propose a framework for\nleveraging expert intervention to solve long-horizon reinforcement learning\ntasks. We consider option templates, which are specifications encoding a\npotential option that can be trained using reinforcement learning. We formulate\nexpert intervention as allowing the agent to execute option templates before\nlearning an implementation. This enables them to use an option, before\ncommitting costly resources to learning it.

We derive\na novel iterative deep learning--based approach for face reenactment which\nadjusts significant pose and expression variations that can be applied to a\nsingle image or a video sequence. For video sequences, we introduce a\ncontinuous interpolation of the face views based on reenactment, Delaunay\nTriangulation, and barycentric coordinates. Occluded face regions are handled\nby a face completion network. Finally, we use a face blending network for\nseamless blending of the two faces while preserving the target skin color and\nlighting conditions. This network uses a novel Poisson blending loss combining\nPoisson optimization with a perceptual loss. We compare our approach to\nexisting state-of-the-art systems and show our results to be both qualitatively\nand quantitatively superior.

Creating accurate models to control\nsuch systems, however, is challenging due to the complex physics of deformable\nmaterials. Accurate Finite Element Method (FEM) models incur prohibitive\ncomputational complexity for closed-loop use. Using a differentiable simulator\nis an attractive alternative, but their applicability to soft actuators and\ndeformable materials remains under-explored. This paper presents a framework\nthat combines the advantages of both. We learn a differentiable model\nconsisting of a material properties neural network and an analytical dynamics\nmodel of the remainder of the manipulation task. This physics-informed model is\ntrained using data generated from FEM and can be used for closed-loop control\nand inference. We evaluate our framework on a dielectric elastomer actuator\n(DEA) coin-pulling task. We simulate DEA coin pulling in FEM, and design\nexperiments to evaluate the physics-informed model for simulation, control, and\ninference. Our model attains < 5% simulation error compared to FEM, and we use\nit as the basis for an MPC controller that outperforms (i.e., requires fewer\niterations to converge) a model-free actor-critic policy, a heuristic policy,\nand a PD controller.",

It is especially\nchallenging in case of dynamic adaptive streaming schemes over HTTP (DASH)\nwhich has increasingly complex characteristics including additional playback\nissues. In this paper, we provide a brief overview of adaptive video streaming\nquality assessment. Upon our review of related works, we analyze and compare\ndifferent variations of objective QoE assessment models with or without using\nmachine learning techniques for adaptive video streaming. Through the\nperformance analysis, we observe that hybrid models perform better than both\nquality-of-service (QoS) driven QoE approaches and signal fidelity measurement.\nMoreover, the machine learning-based model slightly outperforms the model\nwithout using machine learning for the same setting. In addition, we find that\nexisting video streaming QoE assessment models still have limited performance,\nwhich makes it difficult to be applied in practical communication systems.\nTherefore, based on the success of deep learned feature representations for\ntraditional video quality prediction, we also apply the off-the-shelf deep\nconvolutional neural network (DCNN) to evaluate the perceptual quality of\nstreaming videos, where the spatio-temporal properties of streaming videos are\ntaken into consideration.

    "abstract": "Decision-making under uncertainty (DMU) is present in many important\nproblems. An open challenge is DMU in non-stationary environments, where the\ndynamics of the environment can change over time. Reinforcement Learning (RL),\na popular approach for DMU problems, learns a policy by interacting with a\nmodel of the environment offline. Unfortunately, if the environment changes the\npolicy can become stale and take sub-optimal actions, and relearning the policy\nfor the updated environment takes time and computational effort. An alternative\nis online planning approaches such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which\nperform their computation at decision time. Given the current environment, MCTS\nplans using high-fidelity models to determine promising action trajectories.\nThese models can be updated as soon as environmental changes are detected to\nimmediately incorporate them into decision making. However, MCTS's convergence\ncan be slow for domains with large state-action spaces. In this paper, we\npresent a novel hybrid decision-making approach that combines the strengths of\nRL and planning while mitigating their weaknesses. Our approach, called Policy\nAugmented MCTS (PA-MCTS), integrates a policy's actin-value estimates into\nMCTS, using the estimates to seed the action trajectories favored by the\nsearch. We hypothesize that PA-MCTS will converge more quickly than standard\nMCTS while making better decisions than the policy can make on its own when\nfaced with nonstationary environments. We test our hypothesis by comparing\nPA-MCTS with pure MCTS and an RL agent applied to the classical CartPole\nenvironment. We find that PC-MCTS can achieve higher cumulative rewards than\nthe policy in isolation under several environmental shifts while converging in\nsignificantly fewer iterations than pure MCTS.",

    "abstract": "Frugal computing is becoming an important topic for environmental reasons. In\nthis context, several techniques have been proposed to reduce the storage of\nscientific data by dedicated compression methods specially tailored for arrays\nof floating-point numbers. While these techniques are quite efficient to save\nmemory, they introduce additional computations to compress and decompress the\ndata before processing them. In this article, we introduce a new lossy,\nfixed-rate compression technique for 2D-arrays of floating-point numbers which\nallows one to compute directly on the compressed data, without decompressing\nthem. We obtain important speedups since less operations are needed to compute\namong the compressed data and since no decompression and re-compression is\nneeded. More precisely, our technique makes it possible to perform basic linear\nalgebra operations such as addition, multiplication by a constant among\ncompressed matrices and dot product and matrix multiplication among partly\nuncompressed matrices. This work has been implemented into a tool named blaz\nand a comparison with the well-known compressor zfp in terms of execution-time\nand accuracy is presented.",

    "abstract": "Many machine learning tasks involve processing eigenvectors derived from\ndata. Especially valuable are Laplacian eigenvectors, which capture useful\nstructural information about graphs and other geometric objects. However,\nambiguities arise when computing eigenvectors: for each eigenvector $v$, the\nsign flipped $-v$ is also an eigenvector. More generally, higher dimensional\neigenspaces contain infinitely many choices of basis eigenvectors. These\nambiguities make it a challenge to process eigenvectors and eigenspaces in a\nconsistent way. In this work we introduce SignNet and BasisNet -- new neural\narchitectures that are invariant to all requisite symmetries and hence process\ncollections of eigenspaces in a principled manner. Our networks are universal,\ni.e., they can approximate any continuous function of eigenvectors with the\nproper invariances. They are also theoretically strong for graph representation\nlearning -- they can approximate any spectral graph convolution, can compute\nspectral invariants that go beyond message passing neural networks, and can\nprovably simulate previously proposed graph positional encodings.

In contrast\nto previous methods, our process is not limited to scenes viewed under\ncontrolled lighting conditions but can handle complex indoor and outdoor scenes\nviewed under arbitrary illumination conditions. An end-to-end process uses a\nmodel of the scene's geometry and several images capturing the scene's surfaces\nfrom arbitrary viewpoints and under various natural illumination conditions. We\ndevelop a differentiable path tracer that leverages least-square conformal\nmapping for handling multiple disjoint objects appearing in the scene. We\nfollow a two-step optimization process and introduce a multi-view gradient\nconsistency loss which results in up to 30-50% improvement in the image\nreconstruction loss and can further achieve better disentanglement of the\ndiffuse and specular BRDFs compared to other state-of-the-art. We demonstrate\nthe process in real-world indoor and outdoor scenes from images in the wild and\nshow that we can produce realistic renders consistent with actual images using\nthe estimated reflectance properties.

    "abstract": "With the popularity of mobile devices and development of computationally\nintensive applications, researchers are focusing on offloading computation to\nMobile Edge Computing (MEC) server due to its high computational efficiency and\nlow communication delay. As the computing resources of an MEC server are\nlimited, vehicles in the urban area who have abundant idle resources should be\nfully utilized. However, offloading computing tasks to vehicles faces many\nchallenging issues. In this paper, we introduce a vehicular fog-edge computing\nparadigm and formulate it as a multi-stage Stackelberg game to deal with these\nissues. Specifically, vehicles are not obligated to share resources, let alone\ndisclose their private information (e.g., stay time and the amount of\nresources). Therefore, in the first stage, we design a contract-based incentive\nmechanism to motivate vehicles to contribute their idle resources. Next, due to\nthe complicated interactions among vehicles, road-side unit (RSU), MEC server\nand mobile device users, it is challenging to coordinate the resources of all\nparties and design a transaction mechanism to make all entities benefit. In the\nsecond and third stages, based on Stackelberg game, we develop pricing\nstrategies that maximize the utilities of all parties. The analytical forms of\noptimal strategies for each stage are given. Simulation results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed incentive mechanism, reveal the trends of energy\nconsumption and offloading decisions of users with various parameters, and\npresent the performance comparison between our framework and existing MEC\noffloading paradigm in vehicular networks.",

    "abstract": "As a fundamental problem in machine learning, dataset shift induces a\nparadigm to learn and transfer knowledge under changing environment. Previous\nmethods assume the changes are induced by covariate, which is less practical\nfor complex real-world data. We consider the Generalized Label Shift (GLS),\nwhich provides an interpretable insight into the learning and transfer of\ndesirable knowledge. Current GLS methods: 1) are not well-connected with the\nstatistical learning theory; 2) usually assume the shifting conditional\ndistributions will be matched with an implicit transformation, but its explicit\nmodeling is unexplored. In this paper, we propose a conditional adaptation\nframework to deal with these challenges. From the perspective of learning\ntheory, we prove that the generalization error of conditional adaptation is\nlower than previous covariate adaptation. Following the theoretical results, we\npropose the minimum uncertainty principle to learn conditional invariant\ntransformation via discrepancy optimization. Specifically, we propose the\n\\textit{conditional metric operator} on Hilbert space to characterize the\ndistinctness of conditional distributions.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we construct a combined multiscale finite element method\n(MsFEM) using the Local Orthogonal Decomposition (LOD) technique to solve the\nmultiscale problems which may have singularities in some special portions of\nthe computational domain. For example, in the simulation of steady flow\ntransporting through highly heterogeneous porous media driven by extraction\nwells, the singularities lie in the near-well regions. The basic idea of the\ncombined method is to utilize the traditional finite element method (FEM)\ndirectly on a fine mesh of the problematic part of the domain and using the\nLOD-based MsFEM on a coarse mesh of the other part. The key point is how to\ndefine local correctors for the basis functions of the elements near the coarse\nand fine mesh interface, which require meticulous treatment. The proposed\nmethod takes advantages of the traditional FEM and the LOD-based MsFEM, which\nuses much less DOFs than the standard FEM and may be more accurate than the\nLOD-based MsFEM for problems with singularities. The error analysis is carried\nout for highly varying coefficients, without any assumptions on scale\nseparation or periodicity. {Numerical examples with periodic and random highly\noscillating coefficients}, as well as the multiscale problems on the L-shaped\ndomain, and multiscale problems with high-contrast channels or\nwell-singularities are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of\nthe proposed method.",

    "title": "A Scalable Graph-Theoretic Distributed Framework for Cooperative  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "The main challenge of large-scale cooperative multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL) is two-fold: (i) the RL algorithm is desired to be distributed\ndue to limited resource for each individual agent; (ii) issues on convergence\nor computational complexity emerge due to the curse of dimensionality.\nUnfortunately, most of existing distributed RL references only focus on\nensuring that the individual policy-seeking process of each agent is based on\nlocal information, but fail to solve the scalability issue induced by high\ndimensions of the state and action spaces when facing large-scale networks. In\nthis paper, we propose a general distributed framework for cooperative MARL by\nutilizing the structures of graphs involved in this problem. We introduce three\ngraphs in MARL, namely, the coordination graph, the observation graph and the\nreward graph. Based on these three graphs, and a given communication graph, we\npropose two distributed RL approaches. The first approach utilizes the inherent\ndecomposability property of the problem itself, whose efficiency depends on the\nstructures of the aforementioned four graphs, and is able to produce a high\nperformance under specific graphical conditions. The second approach provides\nan approximate solution and is applicable for any graphs. Here the\napproximation error depends on an artificially designed index. The choice of\nthis index is a trade-off between minimizing the approximation error and\nreducing the computational complexity. Simulations show that our RL algorithms\nhave a significantly improved scalability to large-scale MASs compared with\ncentralized and consensus-based distributed RL algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Graph-based learning is a rapidly growing sub-field of machine learning with\napplications in social networks, citation networks, and bioinformatics. One of\nthe most popular type of models is graph attention networks. These models were\nintroduced to allow a node to aggregate information from the features of\nneighbor nodes in a non-uniform way in contrast to simple graph convolution\nwhich does not distinguish the neighbors of a node. In this paper, we study\ntheoretically this expected behaviour of graph attention networks. We prove\nmultiple results on the performance of the graph attention mechanism for the\nproblem of node classification for a contextual stochastic block model. Here\nthe features of the nodes are obtained from a mixture of Gaussians and the\nedges from a stochastic block model where the features and the edges are\ncoupled in a natural way. First, we show that in an \"easy\" regime, where the\ndistance between the means of the Gaussians is large enough, graph attention\nmaintains the weights of intra-class edges and significantly reduces the\nweights of the inter-class edges. As a corollary, we show that this implies\nperfect node classification independent of the weights of inter-class edges.\nHowever, a classical argument shows that in the \"easy\" regime, the graph is not\nneeded at all to classify the data with high probability. In the \"hard\" regime,\nwe show that every attention mechanism fails to distinguish intra-class from\ninter-class edges. We evaluate our theoretical results on synthetic and\nreal-world data.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a simple and effective solution to the problem of\nmulti-view photometric stereo (MVPS). It is well-known that photometric stereo\n(PS) is excellent at recovering high-frequency surface details, whereas\nmulti-view stereo (MVS) can help remove the low-frequency distortion due to PS\nand retain the global geometry of the shape. This paper proposes an approach\nthat can effectively utilize such complementary strengths of PS and MVS. Our\nkey idea is to suitably combine them while taking into account the per-pixel\nuncertainty of their estimates. To this end, we estimate per-pixel surface\nnormals and depth using an uncertainty-aware deep-PS network and deep-MVS\nnetwork, respectively. Uncertainty modeling helps select reliable surface\nnormal and depth estimates at each pixel which then act as a true\nrepresentative of the dense surface geometry. At each pixel, our approach\neither selects or discards deep-PS and deep-MVS network prediction depending on\nthe prediction uncertainty measure. For dense, detailed, and precise inference\nof the object's surface profile, we propose to learn the implicit neural shape\nrepresentation via a multilayer perceptron (MLP). Our approach encourages the\nMLP to converge to a natural zero-level set surface using the confident\nprediction from deep-PS and deep-MVS networks, providing superior dense surface\nreconstruction.

Instead of batch norm, we use\ndivisive normalization of activations (suppressing weak outputs using strong\noutputs), along with implicit $\\ell_2$ normalization of neuronal weights.\nExperiments with standard image classification tasks on CIFAR-10 demonstrate\nthat, relative to baseline end-to-end trained architectures, our proposed\narchitecture (a) leads to sparser activations (with only a slight compromise on\naccuracy), (b) exhibits more robustness to noise (without being trained on\nnoisy data), (c) exhibits more robustness to adversarial perturbations (without\nadversarial training).",

    "abstract": "Modeling user's long-term and short-term interests is crucial for accurate\nrecommendation. However, since there is no manually annotated label for user\ninterests, existing approaches always follow the paradigm of entangling these\ntwo aspects, which may lead to inferior recommendation accuracy and\ninterpretability. In this paper, to address it, we propose a Contrastive\nlearning framework to disentangle Long and Short-term interests for\nRecommendation (CLSR) with self-supervision. Specifically, we first propose two\nseparate encoders to independently capture user interests of different time\nscales. We then extract long-term and short-term interests proxies from the\ninteraction sequences, which serve as pseudo labels for user interests. Then\npairwise contrastive tasks are designed to supervise the similarity between\ninterest representations and their corresponding interest proxies. Finally,\nsince the importance of long-term and short-term interests is dynamically\nchanging, we propose to adaptively aggregate them through an attention-based\nnetwork for prediction. We conduct experiments on two large-scale real-world\ndatasets for e-commerce and short-video recommendation. Empirical results show\nthat our CLSR consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art models with\nsignificant improvements: GAUC is improved by over 0.01, and NDCG is improved\nby over 4%. Further counterfactual evaluations demonstrate that stronger\ndisentanglement of long and short-term interests is successfully achieved by\nCLSR.

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning is emerging as a powerful technique for extracting\nknowledge from unlabeled data. This technique requires a balanced mixture of\ntwo ingredients: positive (similar) and negative (dissimilar) samples. This is\ntypically achieved by maintaining a queue of negative samples during training.\nPrior works in the area typically uses a fixed-length negative sample queue,\nbut how the negative sample size affects the model performance remains unclear.\nThe opaque impact of the number of negative samples on performance when\nemploying contrastive learning aroused our in-depth exploration. This paper\npresents a momentum contrastive learning model with negative sample queue for\nsentence embedding, namely MoCoSE. We add the prediction layer to the online\nbranch to make the model asymmetric and together with EMA update mechanism of\nthe target branch to prevent model from collapsing. We define a maximum\ntraceable distance metric, through which we learn to what extent the text\ncontrastive learning benefits from the historical information of negative\nsamples. Our experiments find that the best results are obtained when the\nmaximum traceable distance is at a certain range, demonstrating that there is\nan optimal range of historical information for a negative sample queue. We\nevaluate the proposed unsupervised MoCoSE on the semantic text similarity (STS)\ntask and obtain an average Spearman's correlation of $77.27\\%$.

While recent works show that\npoint cloud convolutions can be invariant to translation and point permutation,\ninvestigations of the rotation invariance property for point cloud convolution\nhas been so far scarce. Some existing methods perform point cloud convolutions\nwith rotation-invariant features, existing methods generally do not perform as\nwell as translation-invariant only counterpart. In this work, we argue that a\nkey reason is that compared to point coordinates, rotation-invariant features\nconsumed by point cloud convolution are not as distinctive. To address this\nproblem, we propose a simple yet effective convolution operator that enhances\nfeature distinction by designing powerful rotation invariant features from the\nlocal regions. We consider the relationship between the point of interest and\nits neighbors as well as the internal relationship of the neighbors to largely\nimprove the feature descriptiveness.

In contrast to\nstandard classification, which treats classes as discrete symbols, SemSup\nrepresents them as dense vector features obtained from descriptions of classes\n(e.g., \"The cat is a small carnivorous mammal\"). This allows the output space\nto be unbounded (in the space of descriptions) and enables models to generalize\nboth over unseen inputs and unseen outputs (e.g. \"The aardvark is a nocturnal\nburrowing mammal with long ears\"). Specifically, SemSup enables four types of\ngeneralization, to -- (1) unseen class descriptions, (2) unseen classes, (3)\nunseen super-classes, and (4) unseen tasks. Through experiments on four\nclassification datasets across two variants (multi-class and multi-label), two\ninput modalities (text and images), and two output description modalities (text\nand JSON), we show that our SemSup models significantly outperform standard\nsupervised models and existing models that leverage word embeddings over class\nnames. For instance, our model outperforms baselines by 40% and 20% precision\npoints on unseen descriptions and classes, respectively, on a news\ncategorization dataset (RCV1). SemSup can serve as a pathway for scaling neural\nmodels to large unbounded output spaces and enabling better generalization and\nmodel reuse for unseen tasks and domains.",

This study therefore assesses\nprominent, actively-developed visualisation libraries in the Python ecosystem\nwith respect to their suitability for producing visualisations of large vector\ndatasets.

After that a problem with minimizing the sum\nof MDs' weighted delays is formulated to attain a goal of joint MD association\nand resource allocation under limited resources. Considering that the MD\nassociation and resource allocation parameters are coupling in such a\nformulated problem, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm according\nto the coalitional game and convex optimization theorems. To ensure that the\ndesigned algorithm begins from a feasible initial solution, we develop an\ninitiation algorithm according to the conventional best channel association,\nwhich is used for comparison and the input of coalition game in the simulation.\nSimulation results show that the algorithm designed for minimizing the sum of\nMDs' weighted delays may achieve a better performance than the initiation (best\nchannel association) algorithm in general.",

    "abstract": "The development of accurate and scalable cross-modal image-text retrieval\nmethods, where queries from one modality (e.g., text) can be matched to archive\nentries from another (e.g., remote sensing image) has attracted great attention\nin remote sensing (RS). Most of the existing methods assume that a reliable\nmulti-modal training set with accurately matched text-image pairs is existing.\nHowever, this assumption may not always hold since the multi-modal training\nsets may include noisy pairs (i.e., textual descriptions/captions associated to\ntraining images can be noisy), distorting the learning process of the retrieval\nmethods. To address this problem, we propose a novel unsupervised cross-modal\nhashing method robust to the noisy image-text correspondences (CHNR). CHNR\nconsists of three modules: 1) feature extraction module, which extracts feature\nrepresentations of image-text pairs; 2) noise detection module, which detects\npotential noisy correspondences; and 3) hashing module that generates\ncross-modal binary hash codes. The proposed CHNR includes two training phases:\ni) meta-learning phase that uses a small portion of clean (i.e., reliable) data\nto train the noise detection module in an adversarial fashion; and ii) the main\ntraining phase for which the trained noise detection module is used to identify\nnoisy correspondences while the hashing module is trained on the noisy\nmulti-modal training set. Experimental results show that the proposed CHNR\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publicly available at\nhttps://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/chnr",

    "abstract": "Generally, humans are more skilled at perceiving differences between\nhigh-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images than directly judging the quality\nof a single LQ image. This situation also applies to image quality assessment\n(IQA). Although recent no-reference (NR-IQA) methods have made great progress\nto predict image quality free from the reference image, they still have the\npotential to achieve better performance since HQ image information is not fully\nexploited. In contrast, full-reference (FR-IQA) methods tend to provide more\nreliable quality evaluation, but its practicability is affected by the\nrequirement for pixel-level aligned reference images. To address this, we\nfirstly propose the content-variant reference method via knowledge distillation\n(CVRKD-IQA). Specifically, we use non-aligned reference (NAR) images to\nintroduce various prior distributions of high-quality images. The comparisons\nof distribution differences between HQ and LQ images can help our model better\nassess the image quality. Further, the knowledge distillation transfers more\nHQ-LQ distribution difference information from the FR-teacher to the\nNAR-student and stabilizing CVRKD-IQA performance. Moreover, to fully mine the\nlocal-global combined information, while achieving faster inference speed, our\nmodel directly processes multiple image patches from the input with the\nMLP-mixer. Cross-dataset experiments verify that our model can outperform all\nNAR/NR-IQA SOTAs, even reach comparable performance with FR-IQA methods on some\noccasions. Since the content-variant and non-aligned reference HQ images are\neasy to obtain, our model can support more IQA applications with its relative\nrobustness to content variations.

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, for One-Class Collaborative Filtering (OCCF), many\nlearning objectives have been researched based on a variety of underlying\nprobabilistic models. From our analysis, we observe that models trained with\ndifferent OCCF objectives capture distinct aspects of user-item relationships,\nwhich in turn produces complementary recommendations. This paper proposes a\nnovel OCCF framework, named ConCF, that exploits the complementarity from\nheterogeneous objectives throughout the training process, generating a more\ngeneralizable model. ConCF constructs a multi-branch variant of a given target\nmodel by adding auxiliary heads, each of which is trained with heterogeneous\nobjectives. Then, it generates consensus by consolidating the various views\nfrom the heads, and guides the heads based on the consensus. The heads are\ncollaboratively evolved based on their complementarity throughout the training,\nwhich again results in generating more accurate consensus iteratively. After\ntraining, we convert the multi-branch architecture back to the original target\nmodel by removing the auxiliary heads, thus there is no extra inference cost\nfor the deployment.

    "title": "Blind Image Super Resolution with Semantic-Aware Quantized Texture Prior",
    "abstract": "A key challenge of blind image super resolution is to recover realistic\ntextures for low-resolution images with unknown degradations. Most recent works\ncompletely rely on the generative ability of GANs, which are difficult to\ntrain. Other methods resort to high-resolution image references that are\nusually not available. In this work, we propose a novel framework, denoted as\nQuanTexSR, to restore realistic textures with the Quantized Texture Priors\nencoded in Vector Quantized GAN. The QuanTexSR generates textures by aligning\nthe textureless content features to the quantized feature vectors, i.e., a\npretrained feature codebook. Specifically, QuanTexSR formulates the texture\ngeneration as a feature matching problem between textureless features and a\npretrained feature codebook. The final textures are then generated by the\nquantized features from the codebook. Since features in the codebook have shown\nthe ability to generate natural textures in the pretrain stage, QuanTexSR can\ngenerate rich and realistic textures with the pretrained codebook as texture\npriors. Moreover, we propose a semantic regularization technique that\nregularizes the pre-training of the codebook using clusters of features\nextracted from the pretrained VGG19 network. This further improves texture\ngeneration with semantic context. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nQuanTexSR can generate competitive or better textures than previous approaches.\nCode will be made publicly available.",

    "title": "DGSS : Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation using Iterative Style  Mining and Latent Representation Alignment",
    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation algorithms require access to well-annotated datasets\ncaptured under diverse illumination conditions to ensure consistent\nperformance. However, poor visibility conditions at varying illumination\nconditions result in laborious and error-prone labeling. Alternatively, using\nsynthetic samples to train segmentation algorithms has gained interest with the\ndrawback of domain gap that results in sub-optimal performance. While current\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) have proposed different mechanisms to bridge the domain\ngap, they still perform poorly in low illumination conditions with an average\nperformance drop of - 10.7 mIOU. In this paper, we focus upon single source\ndomain generalization to overcome the domain gap and propose a two-step\nframework wherein we first identify an adversarial style that maximizes the\ndomain gap between stylized and source images. Subsequently, these stylized\nimages are used to categorically align features such that features belonging to\nthe same class are clustered together in latent space, irrespective of domain\ngap. Furthermore, to increase intra-class variance while training, we propose a\nstyle mixing mechanism wherein the same objects from different styles are mixed\nto construct a new training image. This framework allows us to achieve a domain\ngeneralized semantic segmentation algorithm with consistent performance without\nprior information of the target domain while relying on a single source. Based\non extensive experiments, we match SoTA performance on SYNTHIA $\\to$\nCityscapes, GTAV $\\to$ Cityscapes while setting new SoTA on GTAV $\\to$ Dark\nZurich and GTAV $\\to$ Night Driving benchmarks without retraining.",

Recently, in the field of story understanding and generation,\nstory completion (SC) was proposed to generate the missing parts of an\nincomplete story.

MPP aims\nto predict the position of the missing part, but the prerequisite knowledge\nthat \"one sentence is missing\" is still required. In this study, we propose\nVariable Number MPP (VN-MPP), a new MPP task that removes this restriction;\nthat is, the task to predict multiple missing sentences or to judge whether\nthere are no missing sentences in the first place. We also propose two methods\nfor this new MPP task. Furthermore, based on the novel task and methods, we\ndeveloped a creative writing support system, COMPASS.

In this article, we propose an\nalternative method in which redundancy is introduced on the message that must\nbe transmitted before its encoding and not in the codewords. This approach\nexploits the Set Shaping Theory whose goal is the study the bijection functions\nf(X)=Y that transform a set of strings into a set of equal size made up of\nstrings of greater length. In this way, this type of function transforms the\nindependent variable x into the dependent variable y whose emission probability\nis conditioned by the previously emitted variables. Thus, if the decoder\ndecodes a symbol associated with a conditional probability equal to zero, we\ndetect an error in the message. If the function f used is the one that\nminimizes the average information content, we develop a code that can be tested\nefficiently.

    "title": "Semantic Soundness for Language Interoperability",
    "abstract": "Programs are rarely implemented in a single language, and thus questions of\ntype soundness should address not only the semantics of a single language, but\nhow it interacts with others. Even between type-safe languages, disparate\nfeatures frustrate interoperability, as invariants from one language can easily\nbe violated in the other. In their seminal 2007 paper, Matthews and Findler\nproposed a multi-language construction that augments the interoperating\nlanguages with a pair of boundaries that allow code from one language to be\nembedded in the other. While the technique has been widely applied, their\nsyntactic source-level interoperability doesn't reflect practical\nimplementations, where behavior of interaction is defined after compilation to\na common target, and any safety must be ensured by target invariants or\ninserted target-level \"glue code.\"\nIn this paper, we present a framework for the design and verification of\nsound language interoperability that follows an\ninteroperation-after-compilation strategy. Language designers specify what data\ncan be converted between types of the languages via a relation $\\tau_A \\sim\n\\tau_B$ and specify target glue code implementing conversions. Then, by giving\na semantic model of source types as sets of target terms, we can establish\nsoundness of conversions: i.e., whenever $\\tau_A \\sim \\tau_B$, the\ncorresponding pair of conversions convert target terms that behave as $\\tau_A$\nto target terms that behave as $\\tau_B$, and vice versa. We can then prove\nsemantic type soundness for the entire system. We illustrate our framework via\na series of case studies that demonstrate how our semantic\ninteroperation-after-compilation approach allows us both to account for complex\ndifferences in language semantics and make efficiency trade-offs based on\nparticularities of compilers or targets.",

The ability to scale up is demonstrated by training\nCNN-based sketch recognition of more than 2.5 times larger number of categories\nthan used previously. For this purpose, a dataset of natural images from 874\ncategories is constructed by combining a number of popular computer vision\ndatasets.

The high performance of modern neural\nnetwork-based MRC systems depends on high-quality, large-scale, human-annotated\ntraining datasets. In the biomedical domain, a crucial challenge in creating\nsuch datasets is the requirement for domain knowledge, inducing the scarcity of\nlabeled data and the need for transfer learning from the labeled\ngeneral-purpose (source) domain to the biomedical (target) domain. However,\nthere is a discrepancy in marginal distributions between the general-purpose\nand biomedical domains due to the variances in topics. Therefore,\ndirect-transferring of learned representations from a model trained on a\ngeneral-purpose domain to the biomedical domain can hurt the model's\nperformance.\nResults: We present an adversarial learning-based domain adaptation framework\nfor the biomedical machine reading comprehension task (BioADAPT-MRC), a neural\nnetwork-based method to address the discrepancies in the marginal distributions\nbetween the general and biomedical domain datasets. BioADAPT-MRC relaxes the\nneed for generating pseudo labels for training a well-performing biomedical-MRC\nmodel. We extensively evaluate the performance of BioADAPT-MRC by comparing it\nwith the best existing methods on three widely used benchmark biomedical-MRC\ndatasets -- BioASQ-7b, BioASQ-8b, and BioASQ-9b.

    "abstract": "We present a generalized version of the Saturation in the Null Space (SNS)\nalgorithm for the task control of redundant robots when hard inequality\nconstraints are simultaneously present both in the joint and in the Cartesian\nspace. These hard bounds should never be violated, are treated equally and in a\nunified way by the algorithm, and may also be varied, inserted or deleted\nonline. When a joint/Cartesian bound saturates, the robot redundancy is\nexploited to continue fulfilling the primary task. If no feasible solution\nexists, an optimal scaling procedure is applied to enforce directional\nconsistency with the original task. Simulation and experimental results on\ndifferent robotic systems demonstrate the efficiency of the approach. The\nproposed algorithm can be viewed as a generic platform that is easily\napplicable to any robotic application in which robots operate in an\nunstructured environment and online handling of joint and Cartesian constraints\nis critical.",

This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning\nmethod to expedite the design of analog circuits at the pre-layout stage, where\nthe goal is to find device parameters to fulfill desired circuit\nspecifications. Our approach is inspired by experienced human designers who\nrely on domain knowledge of analog circuit design (e.g., circuit topology and\ncouplings between circuit specifications) to tackle the problem. Unlike all\nprior methods, our method originally incorporates such key domain knowledge\ninto policy learning with a graph-based policy network, thereby best modeling\nthe relations between circuit parameters and design targets. Experimental\nresults on exemplary circuits show it achieves human-level design accuracy\n(~99%) with 1.5x efficiency of existing best-performing methods. Our method\nalso shows better generalization ability to unseen specifications and\noptimality in circuit performance optimization. Moreover, it applies to\ndesigning diverse analog circuits across different semiconductor technologies,\nbreaking the limitations of prior ad-hoc methods in designing one particular\ntype of analog circuits with conventional semiconductor technology.",

    "abstract": "An explosive growth in the number of on-demand content requests has imposed\nsignificant pressure on current wireless network infrastructure. To enhance the\nperceived user experience, and support latency-sensitive applications, edge\ncomputing has emerged as a promising computing paradigm. The performance of a\nwireless edge depends on contents that are cached. In this paper, we consider\nthe problem of content caching at the wireless edge with unreliable channels to\nminimize average content request latency. We formulate this problem as a\nrestless bandit problem, which is provably hard to solve. We begin by\ninvestigating a discounted counterpart, and prove that it admits an optimal\npolicy of the threshold-type. We then show that the result also holds for the\naverage latency problem. Using these structural results, we establish the\nindexability of the problem, and employ Whittle index policy to minimize\naverage latency. Since system parameters such as content request rate are often\nunknown, we further develop a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm\ndubbed Q-Whittle learning that relies on our index policy. We also derive a\nbound on its finite-time convergence rate. Simulation results using real traces\ndemonstrate that our proposed algorithms yield excellent empirical performance.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the methods on matrix-based or bilinear discriminant\nanalysis (BLDA) have received much attention. Despite their advantages, it has\nbeen reported that the traditional vector-based regularized LDA (RLDA) is still\nquite competitive and could outperform BLDA on some benchmark datasets.\nNevertheless, it is also noted that this finding is mainly limited to image\ndata. In this paper, we propose regularized BLDA (RBLDA) and further explore\nthe comparison between RLDA and RBLDA on another type of matrix data, namely\nmultivariate time series (MTS). Unlike image data, MTS typically consists of\nmultiple variables measured at different time points. Although many methods for\nMTS data classification exist within the literature, there is relatively little\nwork in exploring the matrix data structure of MTS data. Moreover, the existing\nBLDA can not be performed when one of its within-class matrices is singular. To\naddress the two problems, we propose RBLDA for MTS data classification, where\neach of the two within-class matrices is regularized via one parameter. We\ndevelop an efficient implementation of RBLDA and an efficient model selection\nalgorithm with which the cross validation procedure for RBLDA can be performed\nefficiently. Experiments on a number of real MTS data sets are conducted to\nevaluate the proposed algorithm and compare RBLDA with several closely related\nmethods, including RLDA and BLDA. The results reveal that RBLDA achieves the\nbest overall recognition performance and the proposed model selection algorithm\nis efficient; Moreover, RBLDA can produce better visualization of MTS data than\nRLDA.",

Although many efficient sequential\npattern mining algorithms have been proposed, there are few studies can focus\non target sequences. Targeted querying sequential patterns can not only reduce\nthe number of sequences generated by SPM, but also improve the efficiency of\nusers in performing pattern analysis.

In this paper, we formulate the problem of\ntargeted sequential pattern mining and propose a generic framework namely\nTaSPM, based on the fast CM-SPAM algorithm.

However,\nduring their operation, they may suffer from the occurrence of the cavitation,\nwhich can cause loud noise, vibration and damage to the internal components of\nthe valve. Therefore, monitoring the flow status inside valves is significantly\nbeneficial to prevent the additional cost induced by cavitation. In this paper,\na novel acoustic signal cavitation detection framework--based on XGBoost with\nadaptive selection feature engineering--is proposed. Firstly, a data\naugmentation method with non-overlapping sliding window (NOSW) is developed to\nsolve small-sample problem involved in this study. Then, the each segmented\npiece of time-domain acoustic signal is transformed by fast Fourier transform\n(FFT) and its statistical features are extracted to be the input to the\nadaptive selection feature engineering (ASFE) procedure, where the adaptive\nfeature aggregation and feature crosses are performed. Finally, with the\nselected features the XGBoost algorithm is trained for cavitation detection and\ntested on valve acoustic signal data provided by Samson AG (Frankfurt). Our\nmethod has achieved state-of-the-art results. The prediction performance on the\nbinary classification (cavitation and no-cavitation) and the four-class\nclassification (cavitation choked flow, constant cavitation, incipient\ncavitation and no-cavitation) are satisfactory and outperform the traditional\nXGBoost by 4.67% and 11.11% increase of the accuracy.",

In\nthis paper, we propose a multi-pattern adversarial learning one-class\nclassification framework, which allows us to use both the generator and the\ndiscriminator of an adversarial model for efficient ASD. The core idea is\nlearning to reconstruct the normal patterns of acoustic data through two\ndifferent patterns of auto-encoding generators, which succeeds in extending the\nfundamental role of a discriminator from identifying real and fake data to\ndistinguishing between regional and local pattern reconstructions. Furthermore,\nwe present a global filter layer for long-term interactions in the frequency\ndomain space, which directly learns from the original data without introducing\nany human priors. Extensive experiments performed on four real-world datasets\nfrom different industrial domains (three cavitation datasets provided by SAMSON\nAG, and one existing publicly) for anomaly detection show superior results, and\noutperform recent state-of-the-art ASD methods.",

Accordingly,\nmany studies have investigated efficient and robust dynamic state estimation\n(DSE) methods in order to accurately compute the dynamic states of generation\nunits. Nonetheless, most of them forego the dynamic-algebraic nature of power\nnetworks and only consider their nonlinear dynamic representations.

In this paper\nwe derive an exact consistent stiffness matrix for a porous material model, the\nGLPD model developed by Gologanu, Leblond, Perrin, and Devaux for ductile\nfracture for porous metals based on generalized continuum mechanics\nassumptions. Full expressions for the derivatives of the Cauchy stress tensor\nand the generalized moments stress tensor the model involved are provided. The\neffectiveness and robustness of the proposed tangent stiffness moduli are\nassessed by applying the formulation in the finite element simulations of\nductile fracture problems. Comparisons between the performance our stiffness\nmatrix and the standard ones are also provided.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a health problem that affects mainly the female population.\nAn early detection increases the chances of effective treatment, improving the\nprognosis of the disease. In this regard, computational tools have been\nproposed to assist the specialist in interpreting the breast digital image\nexam, providing features for detecting and diagnosing tumors and cancerous\ncells. Nonetheless, detecting tumors with a high sensitivity rate and reducing\nthe false positives rate is still challenging. Texture descriptors have been\nquite popular in medical image analysis, particularly in histopathologic images\n(HI), due to the variability of both the texture found in such images and the\ntissue appearance due to irregularity in the staining process. Such variability\nmay exist depending on differences in staining protocol such as fixation,\ninconsistency in the staining condition, and reagents, either between\nlaboratories or in the same laboratory. Textural feature extraction for\nquantifying HI information in a discriminant way is challenging given the\ndistribution of intrinsic properties of such images forms a non-deterministic\ncomplex system. This paper proposes a method for characterizing texture across\nHIs with a considerable success rate. By employing ecological diversity\nmeasures and discrete wavelet transform, it is possible to quantify the\nintrinsic properties of such images with promising accuracy on two HI datasets\ncompared with state-of-the-art methods.",

To\naddress this limitation, a dual neighborhood hypergraph neural network is\nproposed in this article, which combines the multiscale superpixel segmentation\nand hypergraph convolution to model and exploit the complex relationships.\nFirst, the bi-temporal image pairs are segmented under two scales and fed to a\npre-trained U-net to obtain node features by treating each object under the\nfine scale as a node. The dual neighborhood is then defined using the\nfather-child and adjacent relationships of the segmented objects to construct\nthe hypergraph, which permits models to represent the higher-order structured\ninformation far more complex than just pairwise relationships. The hypergraph\nconvolutions are conducted on the constructed hypergraph to propagate the label\ninformation from a small amount of labeled nodes to the other unlabeled ones by\nthe node-edge-node transform. Moreover, to alleviate the problem of imbalanced\nsample, the focal loss function is adopted to train the hypergraph neural\nnetwork. The experimental results on optical, SAR and heterogeneous optical/SAR\ndata sets demonstrate that the proposed method comprises better effectiveness\nand robustness compared to many state-of-the-art methods.",

Most existing studies mainly focus on removing\nunwanted data samples from a learnt model. Yet we argue that they remove\novermuch information of data samples from latent feature space, which is far\nbeyond the sensitive feature scope that genuinely needs to be unlearned. In\nthis paper, we investigate a vertical unlearning mode, aiming at removing only\nsensitive information from latent feature space. First, we introduce intuitive\nand formal definitions for this unlearning and show its orthogonal relationship\nwith existing horizontal unlearning. Secondly, given the fact of lacking\ngeneral solutions to vertical unlearning, we introduce a ground-breaking\nsolution based on representation detachment, where the task-related information\nis encouraged to retain while the sensitive information is progressively\nforgotten. Thirdly, observing that some computation results during\nrepresentation detachment are hard to obtain in practice, we propose an\napproximation with an upper bound to estimate it, with rigorous theoretical\nanalysis. We validate our method by spanning several datasets and models with\nprevailing performance.

While these\nmethodologies offer many exciting upsides, they also introduce new challenges,\nparticularly in the realm of user privacy. Specifically, data-driven algorithms\noften require user data, and the way this data is collected can pose privacy\nrisks to end users. Centralized data sharing systems where a single entity\n(mobility service provider or transit network operator) collects and manages\nuser data have a central point of failure. Users have to trust that this entity\nwill not sell or use their data to infer sensitive private information.\nUnfortunately, in practice many advertising companies offer to buy such data\nfor the sake of targeted advertisements.\nWith this as motivation, we study the problem of using location data for\ncongestion-aware routing in a privacy-preserving way. Rather than having users\nreport their location to a central operator, we present a protocol in which\nusers participate in a decentralized and privacy-preserving computation to\nestimate travel times for the roads in the network in a way that no\nindividuals' location is ever observed by any other party. The protocol uses\nthe Laplace mechanism in conjunction with secure multi-party computation to\nensure that it is cryptogrpahically secure and that its output is\ndifferentially private.\nA natural question is if privacy necessitates degradation in accuracy or\nsystem performance. We show that if a road has sufficiently high capacity, then\nthe travel time estimated by our protocol is provably close to the travel time\nestimated by the ground truth. We also evaluate the protocol through numerical\nexperiments which show that the protocol provides privacy guarantees with\nminimal overhead to system performance.",

This paper studies the interplay between (i) the\nunfairness of active users, (ii) the unfairness of popular items, and (iii) the\naccuracy (personalization) of recommendation as three angles of our study\ntriangle. We group users into advantaged and disadvantaged levels to measure\nuser fairness based on their activity level. For item fairness, we divide items\ninto short-head, mid-tail, and long-tail groups and study the exposure of these\nitem groups into the top-k recommendation list of users. Experimental\nvalidation of eight different recommendation models commonly used for POI\nrecommendation (e.g., contextual, CF) on two publicly available POI\nrecommendation datasets, Gowalla and Yelp, indicate that most well-performing\nmodels suffer seriously from the unfairness of popularity bias (provider\nunfairness). Furthermore, our study shows that most recommendation models\ncannot satisfy both consumer and producer fairness, indicating a trade-off\nbetween these variables possibly due to natural biases in data.

However, the computational cost of MDO increases as\nthe number of disciplines increases.

Results show that\nthe proposed inverse design can find the optimal design more efficiently\ncompared with the conventional optimization methods, such as backpropagation\nand sequential quadratic programming.

    "abstract": "Practical tools for clustering streaming data must be fast enough to handle\nthe arrival rate of the observations. Typically, they also must adapt on the\nfly to possible lack of stationarity; i.e., the data statistics may be\ntime-dependent due to various forms of drifts, changes in the number of\nclusters, etc. The Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM), whose Bayesian\nnonparametric nature allows it to adapt its complexity to the data, seems a\nnatural choice for the streaming-data case. In its classical formulation,\nhowever, the DPMM cannot capture common types of drifts in the data statistics.\nMoreover, and regardless of that limitation, existing methods for online DPMM\ninference are too slow to handle rapid data streams. In this work we propose\nadapting both the DPMM and a known DPMM sampling-based non-streaming inference\nmethod for streaming-data clustering. We demonstrate the utility of the\nproposed method on several challenging settings, where it obtains\nstate-of-the-art results while being on par with other methods in terms of\nspeed.",

    "abstract": "Using neural networks to represent 3D objects has become popular. However,\nmany previous works employ neural networks with fixed architecture and size to\nrepresent different 3D objects, which lead to excessive network parameters for\nsimple objects and limited reconstruction accuracy for complex objects. For\neach 3D model, it is desirable to have an end-to-end neural network with as few\nparameters as possible to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. In this paper,\nwe propose an efficient model reconstruction method utilizing neural\narchitecture search (NAS) and binary classification. Taking the number of\nlayers, the number of nodes in each layer, and the activation function of each\nlayer as the search space, a specific network architecture can be obtained\nbased on reinforcement learning technology. Furthermore, to get rid of the\ntraditional surface reconstruction algorithms (e.g., marching cube) used after\nnetwork inference, we complete the end-to-end network by classifying binary\nvoxels. Compared to other signed distance field (SDF) prediction or binary\nclassification networks, our method achieves significantly higher\nreconstruction accuracy using fewer network parameters.",

Nearly all\nproblems that are known to be solvable in polynomial time given a branch\ndecomposition of constant mim-width can be expressed in this framework. We add\nseveral natural problems to this list, including problems asking for diverse\nsets of solutions. Our model checking algorithm is efficient whenever the given\nbranch decomposition of the input graph has small index in terms of the\n$d$-neighborhood equivalence [Bui-Xuan, Telle, and Vatshelle, TCS 2013]. We\ntherefore unify and extend known algorithms for tree-width, clique-width and\nrank-width.

    "abstract": "Co-registration of multimodal remote sensing images is still an ongoing\nchallenge because of nonlinear radiometric differences (NRD) and significant\ngeometric distortions (e.g., scale and rotation changes) between these images.\nIn this paper, a robust matching method based on the Steerable filters is\nproposed consisting of two critical steps. First, to address severe NRD, a\nnovel structural descriptor named the Steerable Filters of first- and\nsecond-Order Channels (SFOC) is constructed, which combines the first- and\nsecond-order gradient information by using the steerable filters with a\nmulti-scale strategy to depict more discriminative structure features of\nimages. Then, a fast similarity measure is established called Fast Normalized\nCross-Correlation (Fast-NCCSFOC), which employs the Fast Fourier Transform\ntechnique and the integral image to improve the matching efficiency.\nFurthermore, to achieve reliable registration performance, a coarse-to-fine\nmultimodal registration system is designed consisting of two pivotal modules.\nThe local coarse registration is first conducted by involving both detection of\ninterest points (IPs) and local geometric correction, which effectively\nutilizes the prior georeferencing information of RS images to address global\ngeometric distortions. In the fine registration stage, the proposed SFOC is\nused to resist significant NRD, and to detect control points between multimodal\nimages by a template matching scheme. The performance of the proposed matching\nmethod has been evaluated with many different kinds of multimodal RS images.\nThe results show its superior matching performance compared with the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

In order to improve compositional\ngeneralization, our model performs disentangled representation learning by\nintroducing a prior for the latent content space and another prior for the\nlatent label space. We show both empirically and theoretically that the\nconditional priors can already disentangle representations even without\nspecific regularizations as in the prior work. We can also sample diverse\ncontent representations from the content space without accessing data of the\nseen tasks, and fuse them with the representations of novel tasks for\ngenerating diverse texts in the low-resource settings.

A Bayesian neural network is\nprogressively pruned and grown such that there are sufficient network resources\nto represent a sequence of tasks, while the network does not explode. It starts\nwith the contention that similar tasks should have the same number of total\nnetwork resources, to ensure fair representation of all tasks in a continual\nlearning scenario. Thus, as the data for new task streams in, sufficient\nneurons are added to the network such that the total number of neurons in each\nlayer of the network, including the shared representations with previous tasks\nand individual task related representation, are equal for all tasks. The\nweights that are redundant at the end of training each task are also pruned\nthrough re-initialization, in order to be efficiently utilized in the\nsubsequent task. Thus, the network grows progressively, but ensures effective\nutilization of network resources. We refer to our proposed method as 'Robust\nContinual Learning through a Comprehensively Progressive Bayesian Neural\nNetwork (RCL-CPB)' and evaluate the proposed approach on the MNIST data set,\nunder three different continual learning scenarios. Further to this, we\nevaluate the performance of RCL-CPB on a homogeneous sequence of tasks using\nsplit CIFAR100 (20 tasks of 5 classes each), and a heterogeneous sequence of\ntasks using MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR10 data sets.

To fulfill the real-time requirements in real-world\napplications, it is necessary to efficiently segment the LiDAR scans. Most of\nprevious approaches directly project 3D point cloud onto the 2D spherical range\nimage so that they can make use of the efficient 2D convolutional operations\nfor image segmentation. Although having achieved the encouraging results, the\nneighborhood information is not well-preserved in the spherical projection.\nMoreover, the temporal information is not taken into consideration in the\nsingle scan segmentation task. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel\napproach to semantic segmentation for LiDAR sequences named Meta-RangeSeg,\nwhere a novel range residual image representation is introduced to capture the\nspatial-temporal information. Specifically, Meta-Kernel is employed to extract\nthe meta features, which reduces the inconsistency between the 2D range image\ncoordinates input and Cartesian coordinates output. An efficient U-Net backbone\nis used to obtain the multi-scale features. Furthermore, Feature Aggregation\nModule (FAM) aggregates the meta features and multi-scale features, which tends\nto strengthen the role of range channel. We have conducted extensive\nexperiments for performance evaluation on SemanticKITTI, which is the de-facto\ndataset for LiDAR semantic segmentation.

First, the point cloud received by each UAV is fit by\nthe gaussian mixture model (GMM) and transmitted in the swarm. Resampling from\nthe received GMM contributes to a global map, which is used as the foundation\nfor consensus. Second, to improve flight safety, an active sensing system is\ndesigned to plan the observation angle of each UAV considering the unknown\nfield, overlap of the field of view (FOV), velocity direction and smoothness of\nyaw rotation, and this planning problem is solved by the distributed particle\nswarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm. Last, for the formation motion planning,\nto ensure obstacle avoidance, the formation structure is allowed for affine\ntransformation and is treated as the soft constraint on the control points of\nthe B-spline. Besides, the STGO is introduced to avoid local minima. The\ncombination of GMM communication and STGO guarantees a safe and strict\nconsensus between UAVs. Tests on different formations in the simulation show\nthat our algorithm can contribute to a strict consensus and has a success rate\nof at least 80% for obstacle avoidance in a dense environment.

Autonomous vehicles\nclearly benefit from the ultra-wide Field of View (FoV) offered by 360-degree\npanoramic sensors. However, due to the unique imaging process of panoramic\nimages, models designed for pinhole images do not directly generalize\nsatisfactorily to 360-degree panoramic images. In this paper, we put forward a\nnovel network framework--PanoFlow, to learn optical flow for panoramic images.\nTo overcome the distortions introduced by equirectangular projection in\npanoramic transformation, we design a Flow Distortion Augmentation (FDA)\nmethod. We further propose a Cyclic Flow Estimation (CFE) method by leveraging\nthe cyclicity of spherical images to infer 360-degree optical flow and\nconverting large displacement to relatively small displacement. PanoFlow is\napplicable to any existing flow estimation method and benefit from the progress\nof narrow-FoV flow estimation.

    "abstract": "For scene understanding in robotics and automated driving, there is a growing\ninterest in solving semantic segmentation tasks with transformer-based methods.\nHowever, effective transformers are always too cumbersome and computationally\nexpensive to solve semantic segmentation in real time, which is desired for\nrobotic systems. Moreover, due to the lack of inductive biases compared to\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), pre-training on a large dataset is\nessential but it takes a long time. Knowledge Distillation (KD) speeds up\ninference and maintains accuracy while transferring knowledge from a\npre-trained cumbersome teacher model to a compact student model. Most\ntraditional KD methods for CNNs focus on response-based knowledge and\nfeature-based knowledge. In contrast, we present a novel KD framework according\nto the nature of transformers, i.e., training compact transformers by\ntransferring the knowledge from feature maps and patch embeddings of large\ntransformers. To this purpose, two modules are proposed: (1) the Selective\nKernel Fusion (SKF) module, which helps to construct an efficient\nrelation-based KD framework, Selective Kernel Review (SKR); (2) the Patch\nEmbedding Alignment (PEA) module, which performs the dimensional transformation\nof patch embeddings. The combined KD framework is called SKR+PEA. Through\ncomprehensive experiments on Cityscapes and ACDC datasets, it indicates that\nour proposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art KD frameworks and\nrivals the time-consuming pre-training method.

    "abstract": "Entity linking (EL) is the task of linking entity mentions in a document to\nreferent entities in a knowledge base (KB). Many previous studies focus on\nWikipedia-derived KBs. There is little work on EL over Wikidata, even though it\nis the most extensive crowdsourced KB. The scale of Wikidata can open up many\nnew real-world applications, but its massive number of entities also makes EL\nchallenging. To effectively narrow down the search space, we propose a novel\ncandidate retrieval paradigm based on entity profiling.

During inference, given a mention and its context, we use a\nsequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model to generate the profile of the target\nentity, which consists of its title and description. We use the profile to\nquery the indexed search engine to retrieve candidate entities. Our approach\ncomplements the traditional approach of using a Wikipedia anchor-text\ndictionary, enabling us to further design a highly effective hybrid method for\ncandidate retrieval.

    "abstract": "This paper gives a generative model of the interpretation of formal logic for\ndata-driven logical reasoning. The key idea is to represent the interpretation\nas likelihood of a formula being true given a model of formal logic. Using the\nlikelihood, Bayes' theorem gives the posterior of the model being the case\ngiven the formula. The posterior represents an inverse interpretation of formal\nlogic that seeks models making the formula true. The likelihood and posterior\ncause Bayesian learning that gives the probability of the conclusion being true\nin the models where all the premises are true. This paper looks at statistical\nand logical properties of the Bayesian learning. It is shown that the\ngenerative model is a unified theory of several different types of reasoning in\nlogic and statistics.",

    "title": "Scalable Byzantine Fault Tolerance via Partial Decentralization",
    "abstract": "Byzantine consensus is a critical component in many permissioned Blockchains\nand distributed ledgers. We propose a new paradigm for designing BFT protocols\ncalled DQBFT that addresses three major performance and scalability challenges\nthat plague past protocols: (i) high communication costs to reach\ngeo-distributed agreement, (ii) uneven resource utilization hampering\nperformance, and (iii) performance degradation under varying node and network\nconditions and high-contention workloads. Specifically, DQBFT divides consensus\ninto two parts: 1) durable command replication without a global order, and 2)\nconsistent global ordering of commands across all replicas. DQBFT achieves this\nby decentralizing the heavy task of replicating commands while centralizing the\nordering process.\nUnder the new paradigm, we develop a new protocol, Destiny that uses a\ncombination of three techniques to achieve high performance and scalability:\nusing a trusted subsystem to decrease consensus's quorum size, using threshold\nsignatures to attain linear communication costs, reducing client communication.\nOur evaluations on 300-replica geo-distributed deployment reveal that DQBFT\nprotocols achieve significant performance gains over prior art: $\\approx$3x\nbetter throughput and $\\approx$50\\% better latency.",

    "title": "CoPA: Cold Page Awakening to Overcome Retention Failures in STT-MRAM  Based I/O Buffers",
    "abstract": "Performance and reliability are two prominent factors in the design of data\nstorage systems. To achieve higher performance, recently storage system\ndesigners use DRAM-based buffers. The volatility of DRAM brings up the\npossibility of data loss, so a part of the main storage is conventionally used\nas the journal area to be able of recovering unflushed data pages in the case\nof power failure. Moreover, periodically flushing buffered data pages to the\nmain storage is a common mechanism to preserve a high level of reliability,\nwhich leads to an increase in storage write traffic. To address this\nshortcoming, recent studies offer a small NVM as the Persistent Journal Area\n(PJA) along with DRAM as an efficient approach, named NVM-Backed Buffer\n(NVB-Buffer). This approach aims to address DRAM vulnerability against power\nfailure while reducing storage write traffic. In this paper, we use the most\npromising technologies for PJA among the emerging technologies, which is\nSTT-MRAM to meet the requirements of PJA (high endurance, non-volatility, and\nDRAM-like latency). However, STT-MRAM faces major reliability challenges, i.e.\nRetention Failure, Read Disturbance, and Write Failure. In this paper, we first\nshow that retention failure is the dominant source of errors in NVB-Buffers as\nit suffers from long and unpredictable page idle intervals. Then, we propose a\nnovel NVB-Buffer management scheme, named, Cold Page Awakening (CoPA), which\npredictably reduces the idle time of PJA pages. To this aim, CoPA employs\nDistant Refreshing to periodically overwrite the vulnerable PJA page contents\nby using their replica in DRAM-based buffer. We compare CoPA with the\nstate-of-the-art schemes over several workloads based on physical journaling.\nOur evaluations show that employing CoPA leads to three orders of magnitude\nlower failure rate with negligible performance degradation (1.1%) and memory\noverhead (1.2%).",

    "abstract": "In shared space environments, urban space is shared among different types of\nroad users, who frequently interact with each other to negotiate priority and\ncoordinate their trajectories. Instead of traffic rules, interactions among\nthem are conducted by informal rules like speed limitations and by social\nprotocols e.g., courtesy behavior. Social groups (socially related road users\nwho walk together) are an essential phenomenon in shared spaces and affect the\nsafety and efficiency of such environments. To replicate group phenomena and\nsystematically study their influence in shared spaces; realistic models of\nsocial groups and the integration of these models into shared space simulations\nare required. In this work, we focus on pedestrian groups and adopt an extended\nversion of the social force model in conjunction with a game-theoretic model to\nsimulate their movements. The novelty of our paper is in the modeling of\ninteractions between social groups and vehicles. We validate our model by\nsimulating scenarios involving interaction between social groups and also\ngroup-to-vehicle interaction.",

    "abstract": "Information Architecture (IA) is a blueprint for the information system in\nwebsites or other information-rich environments. It corresponds to how we\norganize, label and structure information. The importance of Information\nArchitecture and its influence on a system's usability is vastly discussed in\nliterature. Because of the inherent connection between Information Architecture\nconcepts and the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) field, we decided to\ninvestigate how previous research has used Information Architecture in the\ncontext of Human Computer Interaction (IAinHCI). In order to do that, we\nfollowed a two phase process. First, we conducted a Systematic Literature\nReview (SLR). We queried both the ACM and IEEE databases. We filtered and\nassessed 311 papers that spanned a decade of research on Information\nArchitecture. We found 25 papers that utilized Information Architecture in the\ncontext of Human Computer Interaction. Then, we followed a Background Reference\nSearch process using the SLR resulting papers as a starting set. We assessed\nthe eligibility of the reference list of all 25 papers and found eight\nadditional papers that were relevant to our research question. Results of our\nreview show that, IAinHCI papers fall under seven main categories, from IoT to\nthe semantic web and ubiquitous technology. The website category, however, was\nboth the most consistent over the years and the most prevalent category\naccounting for 67% of the papers. Our findings suggest that IA has not yet\nuncovered its full potential and there is still room for research to leverage\nand expend the IA knowledge base promising a prosperous future for Information\nArchitecture.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a numerical formulation to model isotropic viscoelastic\nmaterial behavior for membranes and thin shells. The surface and the shell\ntheory are formulated within a curvilinear coordinate system, which allows the\nrepresentation of general surfaces and deformations. The kinematics follow from\nKirchhoff-Love theory and the discretization makes use of isogeometric shape\nfunctions. A multiplicative split of the surface deformation gradient is\nemployed, such that an intermediate surface configuration is introduced. The\nsurface metric and curvature of this intermediate configuration follow from the\nsolution of nonlinear evolution laws - ordinary differential equations (ODEs) -\nthat stem from a generalized viscoelastic solid model. The evolution laws are\nintegrated numerically with the implicit Euler scheme and linearized within the\nNewton-Raphson scheme of the nonlinear finite element framework. The\nimplementation of surface and bending viscosity is verified with the help of\nanalytical solutions and shows ideal convergence behavior. The chosen numerical\nexamples capture large deformations and typical viscoelasticity behavior, such\nas creep, relaxation, and strain rate dependence. It is shown that the proposed\nformulation can also be straightforwardly applied to model boundary\nviscoelasticity of 3D bodies.",

We present two moment-based tailedness measurement concepts to\nimprove performance on the difficult tail examples: Pareto Loss and Kurtosis\nLoss. Kurtosis loss is a symmetric measurement as the fourth moment about the\nmean of the loss distribution. Pareto loss is asymmetric measuring right\ntailedness, modeling the loss using a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). We\ndemonstrate the performance of our approach on several real-world datasets\nincluding time series and spatiotemporal trajectories, achieving significant\nimprovements on the tail examples.",

Our results\nindicate that although -- as to be expected -- the model faces difficulties to\nreplicate the movement behaviours of road users from a new environment, by\nadding social norms (derived through analysis) of that environment to our\nmodel, satisfactory improvement of model accuracy can be obtained with limited\neffort.",

    "abstract": "Thermal management is vital for the efficient and safe operation of alkaline\nelectrolysis systems. Traditional alkaline electrolysis systems use simple\nproportional-integral-differentiation (PID) controllers to maintain the stack\ntemperature near the rated value. However, in renewable-to-hydrogen scenarios,\nthe stack temperature is disturbed by load fluctuations, and the temperature\novershoot phenomenon occurs which can exceed the upper limit and harm the\nstack. This paper focuses on the thermal modelling and controller design of an\nalkaline electrolysis system under dynamic operating conditions. A\ncontrol-oriented thermal model is established in the form of a third-order\ntime-delay process, which is used for simulation and controller design. Based\non this model, we propose two novel controllers to reduce temperature\novershoot: one is a current feed-forward PID controller (PID-I), the other is a\nmodel predictive controller (MPC). Their performances are tested on a lab-scale\nsystem and the experimental results are satisfying: the temperature overshoot\nis reduced by 2.2 degree with the PID-I controller, and no obvious overshoot is\nobserved with the MPC controller. Furthermore, the thermal dynamic performance\nof an MW-scale alkaline electrolysis system is analyzed by simulation, which\nshows that the temperature overshoot phenomenon is more general in large\nsystems. The proposed method allows for higher temperature set points which can\nimprove system efficiency by 1%.",

    "abstract": "Active learning seeks to reduce the number of samples required to estimate\nthe parameters of a model, thus forming an important class of techniques in\nmodern machine learning. However, past work on active learning has largely\noverlooked latent variable models, which play a vital role in neuroscience,\npsychology, and a variety of other engineering and scientific disciplines. Here\nwe address this gap in the literature and propose a novel framework for\nmaximum-mutual-information input selection for learning discrete latent\nvariable regression models. We first examine a class of models known as\n\"mixtures of linear regressions\" (MLR). This example is striking because it is\nwell known that active learning confers no advantage for standard least-squares\nregression. However, we show -- both in simulations and analytically using\nFisher information -- that optimal input selection can nevertheless provide\ndramatic gains for mixtures of regression models; we also validate this on a\nreal-world application of MLRs. We then consider a powerful class of temporally\nstructured latent variable models known as Input-Output Hidden Markov Models\n(IO-HMMs), which have recently gained prominence in neuroscience. We show that\nour method substantially speeds up learning, and outperforms a variety of\napproximate methods based on variational and amortized inference.",

    "title": "A Unified Wasserstein Distributional Robustness Framework for  Adversarial Training",
    "abstract": "It is well-known that deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to\nadversarial attacks, exposing a severe fragility of deep learning systems. As\nthe result, adversarial training (AT) method, by incorporating adversarial\nexamples during training, represents a natural and effective approach to\nstrengthen the robustness of a DNN-based classifier. However, most AT-based\nmethods, notably PGD-AT and TRADES, typically seek a pointwise adversary that\ngenerates the worst-case adversarial example by independently perturbing each\ndata sample, as a way to \"probe\" the vulnerability of the classifier. Arguably,\nthere are unexplored benefits in considering such adversarial effects from an\nentire distribution. To this end, this paper presents a unified framework that\nconnects Wasserstein distributional robustness with current state-of-the-art AT\nmethods. We introduce a new Wasserstein cost function and a new series of risk\nfunctions, with which we show that standard AT methods are special cases of\ntheir counterparts in our framework. This connection leads to an intuitive\nrelaxation and generalization of existing AT methods and facilitates the\ndevelopment of a new family of distributional robustness AT-based algorithms.\nExtensive experiments show that our distributional robustness AT algorithms\nrobustify further their standard AT counterparts in various settings.",

    "abstract": "Regulatory networks (RNs) are a well-accepted modelling formalism in\ncomputational systems biology. The control of RNs is currently receiving a lot\nof attention because it provides a computational basis for cell reprogramming\n-- an attractive technology developed in regenerative medicine. By solving the\ncontrol problem, we learn which parts of a biological system should be\nperturbed to stabilise the system in the desired phenotype.\nWe allow the specification of the Boolean model representing a given RN to be\nincomplete. To that end, we utilise the formalism of partially specified\nBoolean networks which covers every possible behaviour of unspecified parts of\nthe system. Such an approach causes a significant state explosion. This problem\nis addressed by using symbolic methods to represent both the unspecified model\nparts and all possible perturbations of the system.\nAdditionally, to make the control design efficient and practically\napplicable, the optimal control should be minimal in terms of size. Moreover,\nin a partially specified model, a control may achieve the desired stabilisation\nonly for a subset of the possible fully specified model instantiations. To\naddress these aspects, we utilise several quantitative measures. Apart from the\nsize of perturbation, we also examine its robustness -- a portion of\ninstantiations for which the control is applicable.\nWe show that proposed symbolic methods solving the control problem for\npartially specified BNs are efficient and scale well. We also evaluate the\nrobustness metrics in cases of all three studied control types. The robustness\nmetric tells us how big a proportion of fully defined systems the given\nperturbation works. Our experiments support the hypothesis that one-step\nperturbations may be less robust than temporary or permanent perturbations.\nThis is a full version of a paper that is submitted to a journal.",

    "abstract": "An influential line of recent work has focused on the generalization\nproperties of unregularized gradient-based learning procedures applied to\nseparable linear classification with exponentially-tailed loss functions. The\nability of such methods to generalize well has been attributed to the their\nimplicit bias towards large margin predictors, both asymptotically as well as\nin finite time. We give an additional unified explanation for this\ngeneralization and relate it to two simple properties of the optimization\nobjective, that we refer to as realizability and self-boundedness. We introduce\na general setting of unconstrained stochastic convex optimization with these\nproperties, and analyze generalization of gradient methods through the lens of\nalgorithmic stability. In this broader setting, we obtain sharp stability\nbounds for gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent which apply even\nfor a very large number of gradient steps, and use them to derive general\ngeneralization bounds for these algorithms. Finally, as direct applications of\nthe general bounds, we return to the setting of linear classification with\nseparable data and establish several novel test loss and test accuracy bounds\nfor gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent for a variety of loss\nfunctions with different tail decay rates. In some of these case, our bounds\nsignificantly improve upon the existing generalization error bounds in the\nliterature.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that recommendation systems commonly suffer from\npopularity bias. Popularity bias refers to the problem that popular items\n(i.e., frequently rated items) are recommended frequently while less popular\nitems are recommended rarely or not at all. Researchers adopted two approaches\nto examining popularity bias: (i) from the users' perspective, by analyzing how\nfar a recommendation system deviates from user's expectations in receiving\npopular items, and (ii) by analyzing the amount of exposure that long-tail\nitems receive, measured by overall catalog coverage and novelty. In this paper,\nwe examine the first point of view in the book domain, although the findings\nmay be applied to other domains as well. To this end, we analyze the well-known\nBook-Crossing dataset and define three user groups based on their tendency\ntowards popular items (i.e., Niche, Diverse, Bestseller-focused). Further, we\nevaluate the performance of nine state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms and\ntwo baselines (i.e., Random, MostPop) from both the accuracy (e.g., NDCG,\nPrecision, Recall) and popularity bias perspectives. Our results indicate that\nmost state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms suffer from popularity bias in\nthe book domain, and fail to meet users' expectations with Niche and Diverse\ntastes despite having a larger profile size. Conversely, Bestseller-focused\nusers are more likely to receive high-quality recommendations, both in terms of\nfairness and personalization. Furthermore, our study shows a tradeoff between\npersonalization and unfairness of popularity bias in recommendation algorithms\nfor users belonging to the Diverse and Bestseller groups, that is, algorithms\nwith high capability of personalization suffer from the unfairness of\npopularity bias.",

In order to\novercome this challenge, this work proposes a model to coordinate swarms of\nrobots based on the virtualisation and control of these substances in a local\nscope. The model presents a new pheromone modelling, which enables the\ndecentralisation and asynchronicity of navigation decisions. Each robot\nmaintains an independent virtual pheromone map, which is continuously updated\nwith the robot's deposits and pheromone evaporation. Moreover, the individual\npheromone map is also updated by aggregating information from other robots that\nare exploring nearby areas. Thus, individual and independent maps replace the\nneed of a centralising agent that controls and distributes the pheromone\ninformation, which is not always practicable. Pheromone information propagation\nis inspired by ants' vibroacoustic communication, which, in turn, is\ncharacterised as an indirect communication through a type of gossip protocol.\nThe proposed model was evaluated through an agent simulation software,\nimplemented by the authors, and in the Webots platform. Experiments were\ncarried out to validate the model in different environments, with different\nshapes and sizes, as well as varying the number of robots. The analysis of the\nresults has shown that the model was able to perform the coordination of the\nswarm, and the robots have exhibited an expressive performance executing the\nsurveillance task.",

However, current trends in bicyclist crash\nfatalities suggest deficiencies in current roadway design in protecting these\nvulnerable road users. The lack of cycling data is a common challenge for\nstudying bicyclists' safety, behavior, and comfort levels under different\ndesign contexts. To understand bicyclists' behavioral and physiological\nresponses in an efficient and safe way, this study uses a bicycle simulator\nwithin an immersive virtual environment (IVE). Off-the-shelf sensors are\nutilized to evaluate bicyclists' cycling performance (speed and lane position)\nand physiological responses (eye tracking and heart rate (HR)). Participants\nbike in a simulated virtual environment modeled to scale from a real-world\nstreet with a shared bike lane (sharrow) to evaluate how introduction of a bike\nlane and a protected bike lane with pylons may impact perceptions of safety, as\nwell as behavioral and psycho-physiological responses. Results from 50\nparticipants show that the protected bike lane design received the highest\nperceived safety rating and exhibited the lowest average cycling speed.\nFurthermore, both the bike lane and the protected bike lane scenarios show a\nless dispersed gaze distribution than the as-built sharrow scenario, reflecting\na higher gaze focus among bicyclists on the biking task in the bike lane and\nprotected bike lane scenarios, compared to when bicyclists share right of way\nwith vehicles.

UCTopic is pretrained in a large scale to\ndistinguish if the contexts of two phrase mentions have the same semantics. The\nkey to pretraining is positive pair construction from our phrase-oriented\nassumptions. However, we find traditional in-batch negatives cause performance\ndecay when finetuning on a dataset with small topic numbers. Hence, we propose\ncluster-assisted contrastive learning(CCL) which largely reduces noisy\nnegatives by selecting negatives from clusters and further improves phrase\nrepresentations for topics accordingly. UCTopic outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art phrase representation model by 38.2% NMI in average on four\nentity cluster-ing tasks.

In contrast to\nprior work, our theoretical attacks work even if every attribute is a\nquasi-identifier. Hence, they apply to $k$-anonymity, $\\ell$-diversity,\n$t$-closeness, and most other QI-deidentification techniques.\nFirst, we introduce a new class of privacy attacks called downcoding attacks,\nand prove that every QI-deidentification scheme is vulnerable to downcoding\nattacks if it is minimal and hierarchical.

Third, we use\nLinkedIn.com to reidentify 3 students in a $k$-anonymized dataset published by\nEdX (and show thousands are potentially vulnerable), undermining EdX's claimed\ncompliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.\nThe significance of this work is both scientific and political. Our\ntheoretical attacks demonstrate that QI-deidentification may offer no\nprotection even if every attribute is treated as a quasi-identifier. Our\npractical attack demonstrates that even deidentification experts acting in\naccordance with strict privacy regulations fail to prevent real-world\nreidentification. Together, they rebut a foundational tenet of\nQI-deidentification and challenge the actual arguments made to justify the\ncontinued use of $k$-anonymity and other QI-deidentification techniques.",

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting (TSF) is one of the most important tasks in data\nscience, as accurate time series (TS) predictions can drive and advance a wide\nvariety of domains including finance, transportation, health care, and power\nsystems. However, real-world utilization of machine learning (ML) models for\nTSF suffers due to pretrained models being able to learn and adapt to\nunpredictable patterns as previously unseen data arrives over longer time\nscales. To address this, models must be periodically retained or redesigned,\nwhich takes significant human and computational resources. This work presents\nthe Online NeuroEvolution based Neural Architecture Search (ONE-NAS) algorithm,\nwhich to the authors' knowledge is the first neural architecture search\nalgorithm capable of automatically designing and training new recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs) in an online setting. Without any pretraining, ONE-NAS utilizes\npopulations of RNNs which are continuously updated with new network structures\nand weights in response to new multivariate input data. ONE-NAS is tested on\nreal-world large-scale multivariate wind turbine data as well a univariate Dow\nJones Industrial Average (DJIA) dataset, and is shown to outperform traditional\nstatistical time series forecasting, including naive, moving average, and\nexponential smoothing methods, as well as state of the art online ARIMA\nstrategies.",

To address this\nproblem, we propose a robust label correction framework combining the ideas of\nsmall loss selection and noise correction, which learns network parameters and\nreassigns ground truth labels iteratively. Taking the expertise of DNNs to\nlearn meaningful patterns before fitting noise, our framework first trains two\nnetworks over the current dataset with small loss selection. Based on the\nclassification loss and agreement loss of two networks, we can measure the\nconfidence of training data. More and more confident samples are selected for\nlabel correction during the learning process.

Causal DA is a special case of DA that solves the problem from\nthe view of causality. It embeds the probabilistic relationships in multiple\ndomains in a larger causal structure network of a system and tries to find the\ncausal source (or intervention) on the system as the reason of distribution\ndrifts of the system states across domains. In this sense, causal DA is\ntransformed as a causal discovery problem that finds invariant representation\nacross domains through the conditional independence between the state variables\nand observable state of the system given interventions. Testing conditional\nindependence is the corner stone of causal discovery. Recently, a copula\nentropy based conditional independence test was proposed with a rigorous theory\nand a non-parametric estimation method. In this paper, we first present a\nmathemetical model for causal DA problem and then propose a method for causal\nDA that finds the invariant representation across domains with the copula\nentropy based conditional independence test.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Out of Hypervisor (OoH), a new research axis close to\nnested virtualization. Instead of emulating a full virtual hardware inside a VM\nto support a hypervisor, the OoH principle is to individually expose current\nhypervisor-oriented hardware virtualization features to the guest OS so that\nits processes could also take benefit from those features. In fact, several\nhardware virtualization features such as Intel PML, SPP, CAT, and EPT which\ncurrently can only be used by the hypervisor also be beneficial for processes\nthat run inside the VM. We illustrate OoH with Intel PML (Page Modification\nLogging), a feature which allows efficient dirty page tracking for improving VM\nlive migration. According to the fact that dirty page tracking is at the heart\nof process checkpointing (CRIU) and concurrent garbage collection (Boehm), we\npresent two OoH PML designs namely Shadow PML (SPML) and Extended PML (EPML).\nThe former requires no hardware changes but incurs significant overhead,\njustifying EPML which extends PML. We evaluated and compared SPML and EPML with\n/proc and userfaultfd,t wo default solutions in Linux. We do this using a\nkey-value store database as the benchmark. The results show that EPML reduces\nCRIU checkpointing time by about 14% while leading to a negligible overhead (of\nabout 0.5%) compared to SPML, /proc, and userfaultfd.",

Resistance of diverse\nbacterial pathogens to antibiotics is a significant cause of severe SSTIs, and\ntreatment failure results in morbidity, mortality, and increased cost of\nhospitalization. Therefore, antimicrobial surveillance is essential to predict\nantibiotic resistance trends and monitor the results of medical interventions.\nTo address this, we developed machine learning (ML) models (deep and\nconventional algorithms) to predict antimicrobial resistance using antibiotic\nsusceptibility testing (ABST) data collected from patients clinically diagnosed\nwith primary and secondary pyoderma over a period of one year. We trained an\nindividual ML algorithm on each antimicrobial family to determine whether a\nGram-Positive Cocci (GPC) or Gram-Negative Bacilli (GNB) bacteria will resist\nthe corresponding antibiotic. For this purpose, clinical and demographic\nfeatures from the patient and data from ABST were employed in training. We\nachieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.68-0.98 in GPC and 0.56-0.93 in GNB\nbacteria, depending on the antimicrobial family. We also conducted a\ncorrelation analysis to determine the linear relationship between each feature\nand antimicrobial families in different bacteria.

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is a topic of active research. One\nof the main challenges of HSI classification is the lack of reliable labelled\nsamples. Various semi-supervised and unsupervised classification methods are\nproposed to handle the low number of labelled samples. Chief among them are\ngraph convolution networks (GCN) and their variants. These approaches exploit\nthe graph structure for semi-supervised and unsupervised classification. While\nseveral of these methods implicitly construct edge-weights, to our knowledge,\nnot much work has been done to estimate the edge-weights explicitly. In this\narticle, we estimate the edge-weights explicitly and use them for the\ndownstream classification tasks - both semi-supervised and unsupervised. The\nproposed edge-weights are based on two key insights - (a) Ensembles reduce the\nvariance and (b) Classes in HSI datasets and feature similarity have only\none-sided implications. That is, while same classes would have similar\nfeatures, similar features do not necessarily imply the same classes.\nExploiting these, we estimate the edge-weights using an aggregate of ensembles\nof watersheds over subsamples of features. These edge weights are evaluated for\nboth semi-supervised and unsupervised classification tasks. The evaluation for\nsemi-supervised tasks uses Random-Walk based approach. For the unsupervised\ncase, we use a simple filter using a graph convolution network (GCN). In both\nthese cases, the proposed edge weights outperform the traditional approaches to\ncompute edge-weights - Euclidean distances and cosine similarities.\nFascinatingly, with the proposed edge-weights, the simplest GCN obtained\nresults comparable to the recent state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems must often operate under uncertainties like\nsensor degradation and shifts in the operating conditions, which increases its\noperational risk. Dynamic Assurance of these systems requires designing runtime\nsafety components like Out-of-Distribution detectors and risk estimators, which\nrequire labeled data from different operating modes of the system that belong\nto scenes with adverse operating conditions, sensors, and actuator faults.\nCollecting real-world data of these scenes can be expensive and sometimes not\nfeasible. So, scenario description languages with samplers like random and grid\nsearch are available to generate synthetic data from simulators, replicating\nthese real-world scenes. However, we point out three limitations in using these\nconventional samplers. First, they are passive samplers, which do not use the\nfeedback of previous results in the sampling process. Second, the variables to\nbe sampled may have constraints that are often not included. Third, they do not\nbalance the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, which we hypothesize\nis necessary for better search space coverage. We present a scene generation\napproach with two samplers called Random Neighborhood Search (RNS) and Guided\nBayesian Optimization (GBO), which extend the conventional random search and\nBayesian Optimization search to include the limitations. Also, to facilitate\nthe samplers, we use a risk-based metric that evaluates how risky the scene was\nfor the system. We demonstrate our approach using an Autonomous Vehicle example\nin CARLA simulation. To evaluate our samplers, we compared them against the\nbaselines of random search, grid search, and Halton sequence search. Our\nsamplers of RNS and GBO sampled a higher percentage of high-risk scenes of 83%\nand 92%, compared to 56%, 66% and 71% of the grid, random and Halton samplers,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "Modern data analytical workloads often need to run queries over a large\nnumber of tables. An optimal query plan for such queries is crucial for being\nable to run these queries within acceptable time bounds. However, with queries\ninvolving many tables, finding the optimal join order becomes a bottleneck in\nquery optimization. Due to the exponential nature of join order optimization,\noptimizers resort to heuristic solutions after a threshold number of tables.\nOur objective is two fold: (a) reduce the optimization time for generating\noptimal plans; and (b) improve the quality of the heuristic solution. In this\npaper, we propose a new massively parallel algorithm, MPDP, that can\nefficiently prune the large search space (via a novel plan enumeration\ntechnique) while leveraging the massive parallelism offered by modern hardware\n(Eg: GPUs). When evaluated on real-world benchmark queries with PostgreSQL,\nMPDP is at least an order of magnitude faster compared to state-of-the-art\ntechniques for large analytical queries. As a result, we are able to increase\nthe heuristic-fall-back limit from 12 relations to 25 relations with same time\nbudget in PostgreSQL. Also, in order to handle queries with even larger number\nof tables, we augment MPDP to a well known heuristic, IDP$_2$ (iterative DP\nversion 2) and a novel heuristic UnionDP. By systematically exploring a much\nlarger search space, these heuristics provides query plans that are up to 7\ntimes cheaper as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques while being faster\nto compute.",

    "abstract": "Existing Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) methods can be roughly classified as\ntracking-by-detection and joint-detection-association paradigms. Although the\nlatter has elicited more attention and demonstrates comparable performance\nrelative to the former, we claim that the tracking-by-detection paradigm is\nstill the optimal solution in terms of tracking accuracy. In this paper, we\nrevisit the classic tracker DeepSORT and upgrade it from various aspects, i.e.,\ndetection, embedding and association. The resulting tracker, called StrongSORT,\nsets new HOTA and IDF1 records on MOT17 and MOT20. We also present two\nlightweight and plug-and-play algorithms to further refine the tracking\nresults. Firstly, an appearance-free link model (AFLink) is proposed to\nassociate short tracklets into complete trajectories. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first global link model without appearance information.\nSecondly, we propose Gaussian-smoothed interpolation (GSI) to compensate for\nmissing detections. Instead of ignoring motion information like linear\ninterpolation, GSI is based on the Gaussian process regression algorithm and\ncan achieve more accurate localizations. Moreover, AFLink and GSI can be\nplugged into various trackers with a negligible extra computational cost (591.9\nand 140.9 Hz, respectively, on MOT17). By integrating StrongSORT with the two\nalgorithms, the final tracker StrongSORT++ ranks first on MOT17 and MOT20 in\nterms of HOTA and IDF1 metrics and surpasses the second-place one by 1.3 - 2.2.\nCode will be released soon.",

    "abstract": "Understanding what objects could furnish for humans-namely, learning object\naffordance-is the crux to bridge perception and action. In the vision\ncommunity, prior work primarily focuses on learning object affordance with\ndense (e.g., at a per-pixel level) supervision. In stark contrast, we humans\nlearn the object affordance without dense labels. As such, the fundamental\nquestion to devise a computational model is: What is the natural way to learn\nthe object affordance from visual appearance and geometry with humanlike sparse\nsupervision? In this work, we present a new task of part-level affordance\ndiscovery (PartAfford): Given only the affordance labels per object, the\nmachine is tasked to (i) decompose 3D shapes into parts and (ii) discover how\neach part of the object corresponds to a certain affordance category. We\npropose a novel learning framework for PartAfford, which discovers part-level\nrepresentations by leveraging only the affordance set supervision and geometric\nprimitive regularization, without dense supervision. The proposed approach\nconsists of two main components: (i) an abstraction encoder with slot attention\nfor unsupervised clustering and abstraction, and (ii) an affordance decoder\nwith branches for part reconstruction, affordance prediction, and cuboidal\nprimitive regularization. To learn and evaluate PartAfford, we construct a\npart-level, cross-category 3D object affordance dataset, annotated with 24\naffordance categories shared among >25, 000 objects. We demonstrate that our\nmethod enables both the abstraction of 3D objects and part-level affordance\ndiscovery, with generalizability to difficult and cross-category examples.\nFurther ablations reveal the contribution of each component.",

However, the\nexisting methods based on deep neural networks focus mainly on training\ndifferent models for different categories, which makes them unable to perform\nwell in real-world applications when encountering classes unseen during the\ntraining phase. In this work, we thus turn our thoughts to a more challenging\ntask in the LiDAR point clouds, class-agnostic tracking, where a general model\nis supposed to be learned for any specified targets of both observed and unseen\ncategories. In particular, we first investigate the class-agnostic performances\nof the state-of-the-art trackers via exposing the unseen categories to them\nduring testing, finding that a key factor for class-agnostic tracking is how to\nconstrain fused features between the template and search region to maintain\ngeneralization when the distribution is shifted from observed to unseen\nclasses. Therefore, we propose a feature decorrelation method to address this\nproblem, which eliminates the spurious correlations of the fused features\nthrough a set of learned weights and further makes the search region consistent\namong foreground points and distinctive between foreground and background\npoints. Experiments on the KITTI and NuScenes demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod can achieve considerable improvements by benchmarking against the\nadvanced trackers P2B and BAT, especially when tracking unseen objects.",

However, to figure out whether\nPLMs can be reliable knowledge sources and used as alternative knowledge bases\n(KBs), we need to further explore some critical features of PLMs. Firstly,\nknowledge memorization and identification abilities: traditional KBs can store\nvarious types of entities and relationships; do PLMs have a high knowledge\ncapacity to store different types of knowledge? Secondly, reasoning ability: a\nqualified knowledge source should not only provide a collection of facts, but\nsupport a symbolic reasoner. Can PLMs derive new knowledge based on the\ncorrelations between facts? To evaluate these features of PLMs, we propose a\nbenchmark, named Knowledge Memorization, Identification, and Reasoning test\n(KMIR). KMIR covers 3 types of knowledge, including general knowledge,\ndomain-specific knowledge, and commonsense, and provides 184,348 well-designed\nquestions. Preliminary experiments with various representative pre-training\nlanguage models on KMIR reveal many interesting phenomenons: 1) The\nmemorization ability of PLMs depends more on the number of parameters than\ntraining schemes. 2) Current PLMs are struggling to robustly remember the\nfacts. 3) Model compression technology retains the amount of knowledge well,\nbut hurts the identification and reasoning abilities. We hope KMIR can\nfacilitate the design of PLMs as better knowledge sources.",

However, in online platforms, logged user behavior data is\ninevitable to contain noise, and deep recommendation models are easy to overfit\non these logged data. To tackle this problem, we borrow the idea of filtering\nalgorithms from signal processing that attenuates the noise in the frequency\ndomain.

    "abstract": "Image style transfer has attracted widespread attention in the past few\nyears. Despite its remarkable results, it requires additional style images\navailable as references, making it less flexible and inconvenient. Using text\nis the most natural way to describe the style. More importantly, text can\ndescribe implicit abstract styles, like styles of specific artists or art\nmovements. In this paper, we propose a text-driven image style transfer (TxST)\nthat leverages advanced image-text encoders to control arbitrary style\ntransfer. We introduce a contrastive training strategy to effectively extract\nstyle descriptions from the image-text model (i.e., CLIP), which aligns\nstylization with the text description. To this end, we also propose a novel and\nefficient attention module that explores cross-attentions to fuse style and\ncontent features. Finally, we achieve an arbitrary artist-aware image style\ntransfer to learn and transfer specific artistic characters such as Picasso,\noil painting, or a rough sketch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\napproach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both image and textual\nstyles. Moreover, it can mimic the styles of one or many artists to achieve\nattractive results, thus highlighting a promising direction in image style\ntransfer.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between two distributions\ngiven samples from them is well-studied in machine learning and information\ntheory. Motivated by considerations of multi-group fairness, we seek KL\ndivergence estimates that accurately reflect the contributions of\nsub-populations to the overall divergence. We model the sub-populations coming\nfrom a rich (possibly infinite) family $\\mathcal{C}$ of overlapping subsets of\nthe domain. We propose the notion of multi-group attribution for $\\mathcal{C}$,\nwhich requires that the estimated divergence conditioned on every\nsub-population in $\\mathcal{C}$ satisfies some natural accuracy and fairness\ndesiderata, such as ensuring that sub-populations where the model predicts\nsignificant divergence do diverge significantly in the two distributions. Our\nmain technical contribution is to show that multi-group attribution can be\nderived from the recently introduced notion of multi-calibration for importance\nweights [HKRR18, GRSW21]. We provide experimental evidence to support our\ntheoretical results, and show that multi-group attribution provides better KL\ndivergence estimates when conditioned on sub-populations than other popular\nalgorithms.",

The self-embedded point set can\nfunction as the ordinary downsampled one and be visualized efficiently on\nmobile devices. Particularly, we can leverage the self-embedded information to\nfully restore the original point set for detailed analysis on remote servers.\nThis task is challenging since both the self-embedded point set and the\nrestored point set should resemble the original one. To achieve a learnable\nself-embedding scheme, we design a novel framework with two jointly-trained\nnetworks: one to encode the input point set into its self-embedded sparse point\nset and the other to leverage the embedded information for inverting the\noriginal point set back. Further, we develop a pair of up-shuffle and\ndown-shuffle units in the two networks, and formulate loss terms to encourage\nthe shape similarity and point distribution in the results.

    "abstract": "As the use of machine learning (ML) models is becoming increasingly popular\nin many real-world applications, there are practical challenges that need to be\naddressed for model maintenance. One such challenge is to 'undo' the effect of\na specific subset of dataset used for training a model. This specific subset\nmay contain malicious or adversarial data injected by an attacker, which\naffects the model performance. Another reason may be the need for a service\nprovider to remove data pertaining to a specific user to respect the user's\nprivacy. In both cases, the problem is to 'unlearn' a specific subset of the\ntraining data from a trained model without incurring the costly procedure of\nretraining the whole model from scratch. Towards this goal, this paper presents\na Markov chain Monte Carlo-based machine unlearning (MCU) algorithm. MCU helps\nto effectively and efficiently unlearn a trained model from subsets of training\ndataset. Furthermore, we show that with MCU, we are able to explain the effect\nof a subset of a training dataset on the model prediction. Thus, MCU is useful\nfor examining subsets of data to identify the adversarial data to be removed.\nSimilarly, MCU can be used to erase the lineage of a user's personal data from\ntrained ML models, thus upholding a user's \"right to be forgotten\". We\nempirically evaluate the performance of our proposed MCU algorithm on\nreal-world phishing and diabetes datasets. Results show that MCU can achieve a\ndesirable performance by efficiently removing the effect of a subset of\ntraining dataset and outperform an existing algorithm that utilizes the\nremaining dataset.",

Unsupervised point cloud\nrepresentation learning, which aims to learn general and useful point cloud\nrepresentations from unlabelled point cloud data, has recently attracted\nincreasing attention due to the constraint in large-scale point cloud\nlabelling.

Relevant\nbackground including widely adopted point cloud datasets and DNN architectures\nis then briefly presented.

We also quantitatively benchmark and discuss the\nreviewed methods over multiple widely adopted point cloud datasets.

Following this rule, a\ntwo-mode nominal controller is designed where one mode is for moving forward\nand the other one is for slowing down and being motionless. Then, multiple\nexponential control barrier functions(ECBFs) are developed to handle safety\nconstraints for limited playground, collision avoidance, and saturation of the\nvelocity. While designing the nominal controller and ECBFs, an estimated\nbraking time and robust inequality constraints are derived to deal with the\nsystem uncertainty.

Compared\nwith a single one, multiple PV stations collect sufficient fault samples, but\ntheir data is not allowed to be shared directly due to potential conflicts of\ninterest. Therefore, federated learning can be exploited to train a\ncollaborative fault diagnosis model. However, the modeling efficiency is\nseriously affected by the model update mechanism since each PV station has a\ndifferent computing capability and amount of data. Moreover, for the safe and\nstable operation of the PV system, the robustness of collaborative modeling\nmust be guaranteed rather than simply being processed on a central server. To\naddress these challenges, a novel asynchronous decentralized federated learning\n(ADFL) framework is proposed.

    "abstract": "In the last decades, researchers, practitioners and companies struggled in\ndevising mechanisms to detect malicious activities originating security\nthreats. Amongst the many solutions, network intrusion detection emerged as one\nof the most popular to analyze network traffic and detect ongoing intrusions\nbased on rules or by means of Machine Learners (MLs), which process such\ntraffic and learn a model to suspect intrusions. Supervised MLs are very\neffective in detecting known threats, but struggle in identifying zero-day\nattacks (unknown during learning phase), which instead can be detected through\nunsupervised MLs. Unfortunately, there are no definitive answers on the\ncombined use of both approaches for network intrusion detection. In this paper\nwe first expand the problem of zero-day attacks and motivate the need to\ncombine supervised and unsupervised algorithms. We propose the adoption of\nmeta-learning, in the form of a two-layer Stacker, to create a mixed approach\nthat detects both known and unknown threats. Then we implement and empirically\nevaluate our Stacker through an experimental campaign that allows i) debating\non meta-features crafted through unsupervised base-level learners, ii) electing\nthe most promising supervised meta-level classifiers, and iii) benchmarking\nclassification scores of the Stacker with respect to supervised and\nunsupervised classifiers. Last, we compare our solution with existing works\nfrom the recent literature. Overall, our Stacker reduces misclassifications\nwith respect to (un)supervised ML algorithms in all the 7 public datasets we\nconsidered, and outperforms existing studies in 6 out of those 7 datasets. In\nparticular, it turns out to be more effective in detecting zero-day attacks\nthan supervised algorithms, limiting their main weakness but still maintaining\nadequate capabilities in detecting known attacks.",

    "abstract": "Learning the user-item relevance hidden in implicit feedback data plays an\nimportant role in modern recommender systems. Neural sequential recommendation\nmodels, which formulates learning the user-item relevance as a sequential\nclassification problem to distinguish items in future behaviors from others\nbased on the user's historical behaviors, have attracted a lot of interest in\nboth industry and academic due to their substantial practical value. Though\nachieving many practical successes, we argue that the intrinsic {\\bf\nincompleteness} and {\\bf inaccuracy} of user behaviors in implicit feedback\ndata is ignored and conduct preliminary experiments for supporting our claims.\nMotivated by the observation that model-free methods like behavioral\nretargeting (BR) and item-based collaborative filtering (ItemCF) hit different\nparts of the user-item relevance compared to neural sequential recommendation\nmodels, we propose a novel model-agnostic training approach called WSLRec,\nwhich adopts a three-stage framework: pre-training, top-$k$ mining, and\nfine-tuning. WSLRec resolves the incompleteness problem by pre-training models\non extra weak supervisions from model-free methods like BR and ItemCF, while\nresolves the inaccuracy problem by leveraging the top-$k$ mining to screen out\nreliable user-item relevance from weak supervisions for fine-tuning.\nExperiments on two benchmark datasets and online A/B tests verify the\nrationality of our claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of WSLRec.",

    "abstract": "Objective. Mammography reports document the diagnosis of patients'\nconditions. However, many reports contain non-standard terms (non-BI-RADS\ndescriptors) and incomplete statements, which can lead to conclusions that are\nnot well-supported by the reported findings. Our aim was to develop a tool to\ndetect such discrepancies by comparing the reported conclusions to those that\nwould be expected based on the reported radiology findings. Materials and\nMethods. A deidentified data set from an academic hospital containing 258\nmammography reports supplemented by 120 reports found on the web was used for\ntraining and evaluation. Spell checking and term normalization was used to\nunambiguously determine the reported BI-RADS descriptors. The resulting data\nwere input into seven classifiers that classify mammography reports, based on\ntheir Findings sections, into seven BI-RADS final assessment categories.\nFinally, the semantic similarity score of a report to each BI-RADS category is\nreported. Results. Our term normalization algorithm correctly identified 97% of\nthe BI-RADS descriptors in mammography reports. Our system provided 76%\nprecision and 83% recall in correctly classifying the reports according to\nBI-RADS final assessment category. Discussion. The strength of our approach\nrelies on providing high importance to BI-RADS terms in the summarization\nphase, on the semantic similarity that considers the complex data\nrepresentation, and on the classification into all seven BI-RADs categories.\nConclusion. BI-RADS descriptors and expected final assessment categories could\nbe automatically detected by our approach with fairly good accuracy, which\ncould be used to make users aware that their reported findings do not match\nwell with their conclusion.",

In a weakly supervised manner, we propose a Spatial\nTransform AutoEncoder (STAE) to learn an interpretable and controllable\nrepresentation in which different parts correspond to different object\nattributes (shape, color, position). Due to the high controllability of the\nrepresentations, STAE can simply recombine and recode the representations to\ngenerate unseen goals for agents to practice themselves. The manifold structure\nof the learned representation maintains consistency with the physical position,\nwhich is beneficial for reward calculation.

However, under such a challenging but practical\nsetting, the crafted adversarial examples are always prone to overfitting to\nthe proxy model employed, presenting poor transferability. In this paper, we\nsuggest alleviating the overfitting issue from a novel perspective, i.e.,\ndesigning a fitted model architecture. Specifically, delving the bottom of the\ncause of poor transferability, we arguably decompose and reconstruct the\nexisting model architecture into an effective model architecture, namely\nmulti-track model architecture (MMA). The adversarial examples crafted on the\nMMA can maximumly relieve the effect of model-specified features to it and\ntoward the vulnerable directions adopted by diverse architectures.

A recent machine learning approach, called federated learning, keeps\nuser data on the device in the distributed computing environment. Though\nfederated learning is useful for protecting privacy, it experiences poor\nperformance in terms of the end-to-end response time in home IoT services,\nbecause IoT devices are usually controlled by remote servers in the cloud. In\naddition, it is difficult to achieve the high accuracy of federated learning\nmodels due to insufficient data problems and model inversion attacks. In this\npaper, we propose a local IoT control method for a federated learning home\nservice that recognizes the user behavior in the home network quickly and\naccurately. We present a federated learning client with transfer learning and\ndifferential privacy to solve data scarcity and data model inversion attack\nproblems. From experiments, we show that the local control of home IoT devices\nfor user authentication and control message transmission by the federated\nlearning clients improves the response time to less than 1 second.

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL)-based channel state information (CSI) feedback improves\nthe capacity and energy efficiency of massive multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) systems in frequency division duplexing mode. However, multiple neural\nnetworks with different lengths of feedback overhead are required by\ntime-varying bandwidth resources. The storage space required at the user\nequipment (UE) and the base station (BS) for these models increases linearly\nwith the number of models. In this paper, we propose a DL-based changeable-rate\nframework with novel quantization scheme to improve the efficiency and\nfeasibility of CSI feedback systems. This framework can reutilize all the\nnetwork layers to achieve overhead-changeable CSI feedback to optimize the\nstorage efficiency at the UE and the BS sides. Designed quantizer in this\nframework can avoid the normalization and gradient problems faced by\ntraditional quantization schemes. Specifically, we propose two DL-based\nchangeable-rate CSI feedback networks CH-CsiNetPro and CH-DualNetSph by\nintroducing a feedback overhead control unit. Then, a pluggable quantization\nblock (PQB) is developed to further improve the encoding efficiency of CSI\nfeedback in an end-to-end way. Compared with existing CSI feedback methods, the\nproposed framework saves the storage space by about 50% with changeable-rate\nscheme and improves the encoding efficiency with the quantization module.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art crowd counting models follow an encoder-decoder approach.\nImages are first processed by the encoder to extract features. Then, to account\nfor perspective distortion, the highest-level feature map is fed to extra\ncomponents to extract multiscale features, which are the input to the decoder\nto generate crowd densities. However, in these methods, features extracted at\nearlier stages during encoding are underutilised, and the multiscale modules\ncan only capture a limited range of receptive fields, albeit with considerable\ncomputational cost. This paper proposes a novel crowd counting architecture\n(FusionCount), which exploits the adaptive fusion of a large majority of\nencoded features instead of relying on additional extraction components to\nobtain multiscale features. Thus, it can cover a more extensive scope of\nreceptive field sizes and lower the computational cost. We also introduce a new\nchannel reduction block, which can extract saliency information during decoding\nand further enhance the model's performance. Experiments on two benchmark\ndatabases demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results with\nreduced computational complexity.",

    "abstract": "Decompositional parameters such as treewidth are commonly used to obtain\nfixed-parameter algorithms for NP-hard graph problems. For problems that are\nW[1]-hard parameterized by treewidth, a natural alternative would be to use a\nsuitable analogue of treewidth that is based on edge cuts instead of vertex\nseparators. While tree-cut width has been coined as such an analogue of\ntreewidth for edge cuts, its algorithmic applications have often led to\ndisappointing results: out of twelve problems where one would hope for\nfixed-parameter tractability parameterized by an edge-cut based analogue to\ntreewidth, eight were shown to be W[1]-hard parameterized by tree-cut width.\nAs our main contribution, we develop an edge-cut based analogue to treewidth\ncalled edge-cut width. Edge-cut width is, intuitively, based on measuring the\ndensity of cycles passing through a spanning tree of the graph. Its benefits\ninclude not only a comparatively simple definition, but mainly that it has\ninteresting algorithmic properties: it can be computed by a fixed-parameter\nalgorithm, and it yields fixed-parameter algorithms for all the aforementioned\nproblems where tree-cut width failed to do so.",

    "abstract": "Most dominant neural machine translation (NMT) models are restricted to make\npredictions only according to the local context of preceding words in a\nleft-to-right manner. Although many previous studies try to incorporate global\ninformation into NMT models, there still exist limitations on how to\neffectively exploit bidirectional global context. In this paper, we propose a\nConfidence Based Bidirectional Global Context Aware (CBBGCA) training framework\nfor NMT, where the NMT model is jointly trained with an auxiliary conditional\nmasked language model (CMLM). The training consists of two stages: (1)\nmulti-task joint training; (2) confidence based knowledge distillation. At the\nfirst stage, by sharing encoder parameters, the NMT model is additionally\nsupervised by the signal from the CMLM decoder that contains bidirectional\nglobal contexts. Moreover, at the second stage, using the CMLM as teacher, we\nfurther pertinently incorporate bidirectional global context to the NMT model\non its unconfidently-predicted target words via knowledge distillation.\nExperimental results show that our proposed CBBGCA training framework\nsignificantly improves the NMT model by +1.02, +1.30 and +0.57 BLEU scores on\nthree large-scale translation datasets, namely WMT'14 English-to-German, WMT'19\nChinese-to-English and WMT'14 English-to-French, respectively.",

By particularly considering the channel\nestimation errors, we jointly design the transmit coefficients at the WDs and\nthe receive strategy at the AP, for minimizing the computation mean squared\nerror (MSE). First, we consider the single-input single-output (SISO) case with\neach WD and AP equipped with one single antenna, in which the globally optimal\nsolution to the computation MSE minimization problem is obtained in closed\nform. Next, we consider the single-input multiple-output (SIMO) case with\nmultiple receive antennas at the AP, in which a high-quality solution is\nobtained based on alternating optimization and convex optimization. For both\ncases, the optimized power control solution at the WDs follows a\nthreshold-based regularized channel inversion structure; while for the SIMO\ncase, the receive beamforming at the AP follows a sum-minimum MSE (MMSE)\nstructure. It is shown that with finite receive antennas, a non-zero\ncomputation MSE is inevitable due to the channel estimation errors even when\nthe WDs' transmit powers become infinity; while with massive receive antennas,\na vanishing MSE is achievable when the channel vectors are independent and\nidentically distributed. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed designs.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the role of quadrature exactness in the approximation\nscheme of hyperinterpolation. Constructing a hyperinterpolant of degree $n$\nrequires an $m$-point positive-weight quadrature rule with exactness degree\n$2n$. Aided by the Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund inequality, we affirm that when the\nrequired exactness degree $2n$ is relaxed to $n+k$ with $0<k\\leq n$, the $L^2$\nnorm of the hyperinterpolation operator is bounded by a constant independent of\n$n$. The resulting scheme is convergent as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$ if $k$ is\npositively correlated to $n$. Thus, the family of candidate quadrature rules\nfor constructing hyperinterpolants can be significantly enriched, and the\nnumber of quadrature points can be considerably reduced. As a potential cost,\nthis relaxation may slow the convergence rate of hyperinterpolation in terms of\nthe reduced degrees of quadrature exactness.",

For the calibration of LiDAR and camera, the existing\nmethod is generally to calibrate the intrinsic of the camera first and then\ncalibrate the extrinsic of the LiDAR and camera. If the camera's intrinsic is\nnot calibrated correctly in the first stage, it isn't easy to calibrate the\nLiDAR-camera extrinsic accurately. Due to the complex internal structure of the\ncamera and the lack of an effective quantitative evaluation method for the\ncamera's intrinsic calibration, in the actual calibration, the accuracy of\nextrinsic parameter calibration is often reduced due to the tiny error of the\ncamera's intrinsic parameters. To this end, we propose a novel target-based\njoint calibration method of the camera intrinsic and LiDAR-camera extrinsic\nparameters. Firstly, we design a novel calibration board pattern, adding four\ncircular holes around the checkerboard for locating the LiDAR pose.\nSubsequently, a cost function defined under the reprojection constraints of the\ncheckerboard and circular holes features is designed to solve the camera's\nintrinsic parameters, distortion factor, and LiDAR-camera extrinsic parameter.\nIn the end, quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted in actual\nand simulated environments, and the result shows the proposed method can\nachieve accuracy and robustness performance.

    "abstract": "Growing code bases of modern applications have led to a steady increase in\nthe number of vulnerabilities. Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) is one promising\nmitigation that is more and more widely deployed and prevents numerous\nexploits. CFI focuses purely on one security domain. That is, transitions\nbetween user space and kernel space are not protected by CFI. Furthermore, if\nuser space CFI is bypassed, the system and kernel interfaces remain\nunprotected, and an attacker can run arbitrary transitions.\nIn this paper, we introduce the concept of syscall-flow-integrity protection\n(SFIP) that complements the concept of CFI with integrity for user-kernel\ntransitions. Our proof-of-concept implementation relies on static analysis\nduring compilation to automatically extract possible syscall transitions. An\napplication can opt-in to SFIP by providing the extracted information to the\nkernel for runtime enforcement. The concept is built on three fully-automated\npillars: First, a syscall state machine, representing possible transitions\naccording to a syscall digraph model. Second, a syscall-origin mapping, which\nmaps syscalls to the locations at which they can occur. Third, an efficient\nenforcement of syscall-flow integrity in a modified Linux kernel. In our\nevaluation, we show that SFIP can be applied to large scale applications with\nminimal slowdowns. In a micro- and a macrobenchmark, it only introduces an\noverhead of 13.1% and 1.8%, respectively. In terms of security, we discuss and\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in preventing control-flow-hijacking attacks in\nreal-world applications. Finally, to highlight the reduction in attack surface,\nwe perform an analysis of the state machines and syscall-origin mappings of\nseveral real-world applications. On average, SFIP decreases the number of\npossible transitions by 38.6% compared to seccomp and 90.9% when no protection\nis applied.",

The\nimputation accuracy is further improved by characterizing individual samples\nwith cluster labels (CISCL) obtained from the training data. Our extensive\nanalyses involving six tabular data sets, up to 80% missingness, and three\nmissingness types (missing completely at random, missing at random, missing not\nat random) reveal that ensemble or deep learning within MICE is superior to the\nbaseline MICE (b-MICE), both of which are consistently outperformed by CISCL.\nResults show that CISCL plus b-MICE outperforms b-MICE for all percentages and\ntypes of missingness.

The Voronoi\ndiagram is used to divide region into cells and generate initial solutions that\npresent the positions of the deployed IoT objects. Then, a genetic algorithm is\nexecuted in parallel in several nodes to improve these positions. The developed\nVD-GA approach was evaluated on an experimental environment by prototyping on a\nreal testbed utilizing M5StickC nodes equipped with ESP32 processor. The\nexperiments show that the distributed approach provided better degree of\ncoverage, RSSI, lifetime and number of neighboring objects than those given by\nthe original algorithms in terms of the suggested distributed Genetic-Voronoi\nalgorithm outperforms the centralized one in terms of speed of computing. .",

    "abstract": "CountSketch is a popular dimensionality reduction technique that maps vectors\nto a lower dimension using randomized linear measurements. The sketch supports\nrecovering $\\ell_2$-heavy hitters of a vector (entries with $v[i]^2 \\geq\n\\frac{1}{k}\\|\\boldsymbol{v}\\|^2_2$). We study the robustness of the sketch in\nadaptive settings where input vectors may depend on the output from prior\ninputs. Adaptive settings arise in processes with feedback or with adversarial\nattacks. We show that the classic estimator is not robust, and can be attacked\nwith a number of queries of the order of the sketch size. We propose a robust\nestimator (for a slightly modified sketch) that allows for quadratic number of\nqueries in the sketch size, which is an improvement factor of $\\sqrt{k}$ (for\n$k$ heavy hitters) over prior work.",

Firstly, all epic ontological models\ndeveloped till date have been designed following ad-hoc methodologies, most\noften, combining existing general purpose ontology development methodologies.\nSecondly, none of the ad-hoc methodologies consider the potential reuse of\nexisting epic ontological models for enrichment, if available. The paper\npresents, as a unified solution to the above shortcomings, the design and\ndevelopment of GENOME - the first dedicated methodology for iterative\nontological modelling of epics, potentially extensible to works in different\nresearch arenas of digital humanities in general. GENOME is grounded in\ntransdisciplinary foundations of canonical norms for epics, knowledge modelling\nbest practices, application satisfiability norms and cognitive generative\nquestions. It is also the first methodology (in epic modelling but also in\ngeneral) to be flexible enough to integrate, in practice, the options of\nknowledge modelling via reuse or from scratch. The feasibility of GENOME is\nvalidated via a first brief implementation of ontological modelling of the\nIndian epic - Mahabharata by reusing an existing ontology.

In the context of DUGKS, the recovered kinetic\nequation from the flux evaluation with linear reconstruction in the previous\nDUGKS is analyzed.

To correctly recover the kinetic equation up to the second order\naccuracy, the value of the distribution function that will propagate along the\ncharacteristic line with ending point at the cell interface is appropriated by\nthe parabolic reconstruction instead of the linear reconstruction. To validate\nthe accuracy of the present DUGKS for the CACE, several benchmark problems,\nincluding the diagonal translation of a circular interface, the rotation of a\nZaleska disk and the deformation of a circular interface, have been simulated.\nNumerical results show that the present DUGKS scheme is able to capture the\ninterface with improved accuracy when compared with the previous DUGKS.",

The stacked capsule autoencoder (SCAE) is a\nstate-of-the-art CapsNet, and achieved unsupervised classification of CapsNets\nfor the first time.

In this paper, we propose an evasion attack\nagainst SCAE, where the attacker can generate adversarial perturbations based\non reducing the contribution of the object capsules in SCAE related to the\noriginal category of the image. The adversarial perturbations are then applied\nto the original images, and the perturbed images will be misclassified.\nFurthermore, we propose a defense method called Hybrid Adversarial Training\n(HAT) against such evasion attacks.

We\nevaluate the defense method and the experimental results show that the refined\nSCAE model can achieve 82.14% classification accuracy under evasion attack.

Previous studies often use discrete systems,\ncomposed of rigid elements and nonlinear springs, to model the nonlinear\ndynamic responses of the continuum metamaterials. Yet it remains a challenge to\naccurately construct such systems based on the geometry of the building blocks\nof the metamaterial. In this work, we propose a machine learning approach to\naddress this challenge. A metamaterial graph network (MGN) is used to represent\nthe discrete system, where the nodal features contain the positions and\norientations the rigid elements, and the edge update functions describe the\nmechanics of the nonlinear springs. We use Gaussian process regression as the\nsurrogate model to characterize the elastic energy of the nonlinear springs as\na function of the relative positions and orientations of the connected rigid\nelements. The optimal model can be obtained by \"learning\" from the data\ngenerated via finite element calculation over the corresponding building block\nof the continuum metamaterial. Then, we deploy the optimal model to the network\nso that the dynamics of the metamaterial at the structural scale can be\nstudied. We verify the accuracy of our machine learning approach against\nseveral representative numerical examples. In these examples, the proposed\napproach can significantly reduce the computational cost when compared to\ndirect numerical simulation while reaching comparable accuracy.

Plenty of methods\nbased on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved promising results\nin the past decades. Inspired by the success of Transformers, some methods\nattempt to tackle UDA problem by adopting pure transformer architectures, and\ninterpret the models by applying the long-range dependency strategy at image\npatch-level. However, the algorithmic complexity is high and the\ninterpretability seems weak. In this paper, we propose the Domain-Transformer\n(DoT) for UDA, which integrates the CNN-backbones and the core attention\nmechanism of Transformers from a new perspective. Specifically, a plug-and-play\ndomain-level attention mechanism is proposed to learn the sample correspondence\nbetween domains. This is significantly different from existing methods which\nonly capture the local interactions among image patches. Instead of explicitly\nmodeling the distribution discrepancy from either domain-level or class-level,\nDoT learns transferable features by achieving the local semantic consistency\nacross domains, where the domain-level attention and manifold regularization\nare explored. Then, DoT is free of pseudo-labels and explicit domain\ndiscrepancy optimization. Theoretically, DoT is connected with the optimal\ntransportation algorithm and statistical learning theory.

Those\ntechniques lead to quantization artifacts and do not consider the relationship\nbetween the regression response and the point cloud during pre-processing.\nTherefore, we propose a general and holistic \"Bayesian Nonlinear Tensor\nLearning and Modeler\" (ANTLER) to model the relationship of unstructured,\nvarying-size point cloud data with a scalar or multivariate response. The\nproposed ANTLER simultaneously optimizes a nonlinear tensor dimensionality\nreduction and a nonlinear regression model with a 3D point cloud input and a\nscalar or multivariate response. ANTLER has the ability to consider the complex\ndata representation, high-dimensionality,and inconsistent size of the 3D point\ncloud data.",

    "title": "A review on geometric constraint solving",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive review of geometric constraint solving in\nparametric computer-aided design (CAD), with the major focus on its advances in\nthe last 15 years. Geometric constraint solving can date back to the very first\nCAD prototype, Sketchpad, in the 1960s, but serious research studies were\ncarried out only after parametric CAD was introduced in the late 1980s. In the\nfollowing 30-year history of GCS research, two development stages may be\nidentified: (1) the first 15 years (late 1980s - mid 2000s) were primarily\ndevoted to geometric constraint decomposition for well-constrained systems or\nthose with only structural constraint dependencies; and (2) the second 15 years\n(late 2000s - now) have seen research efforts shifted towards classification\ncriteria and decomposition algorithms for general constraint systems (with and\nwithout non-structural constraint dependencies). Most existing reviews focused\non the first 15 years. The problem researched in the second 15 years is,\nhowever, equally important, considering that a manually specified constraint\nsystem usually contains under- and over-constrained parts, and that such parts\nmust be correctly detected and resolved before numerical solving can work. In\nthis regard, this review paper covers both stages and will discusses what has\nalready been made possible for handling general constraint systems, what\ndevelopments can be expected in the near future, and which areas remain\nproblematic.",

However, the existing\nworks mainly rely on hand-crafted data annotation heuristics to generate\npositive training samples, which not only call for domain expertise and\nlaborious tuning, but are also prone to the following unfavorable cases: 1)\ntrivial positives, 2) coarse-grained positives, and 3) false positives. As a\nresult, the self-supervision's quality can be severely limited in reality. In\nthis work, we propose a novel framework InfoCSE to address the above problems.\nInstead of relying on annotation heuristics defined by humans, it leverages the\nsentence representation model itself and realizes the following iterative\nself-supervision process: on one hand, the improvement of sentence\nrepresentation may contribute to the quality of data annotation; on the other\nhand, more effective data annotation helps to generate high-quality positive\nsamples, which will further improve the current sentence representation model.\nIn other words, the representation learning and data annotation become mutually\nreinforced, where a strong self-supervision effect can be derived.

We decompose a neural network into a\nseries of subnetworks of weight pathways, and establish characteristic maps for\nthese subnetworks. The parameters of a characteristic map can be visualized,\nproviding a longitudinal perspective of the network and making the neural\nnetwork explainable. Using WPA, we discover that a neural network stores and\nutilizes information in a \"holographic\" way, that is, the network encodes all\ntraining samples in a coherent structure. An input vector interacts with this\n\"holographic\" structure to enhance or suppress each subnetwork which working\ntogether to produce the correct activities in the output neurons to recognize\nthe input sample. Furthermore, with WPA, we reveal fundamental learning modes\nof a neural network: the linear learning mode and the nonlinear learning mode.\nThe former extracts linearly separable features while the latter extracts\nlinearly inseparable features. It is found that hidden-layer neurons\nself-organize into different classes in the later stages of the learning\nprocess. It is further discovered that the key strategy to improve the\nperformance of a neural network is to control the ratio of the two learning\nmodes to match that of the linear and the nonlinear features, and that\nincreasing the width or the depth of a neural network helps this ratio\ncontrolling process. This provides theoretical ground for the practice of\noptimizing a neural network via increasing its width or its depth.

Smoothed representation is the probability of candidate tokens\nobtained from a pre-trained masked language model, which can be seen as a more\ninformative substitution to the one-hot representation. We propose an efficient\ndata augmentation method, termed text smoothing, by converting a sentence from\nits one-hot representation to a controllable smoothed representation. We\nevaluate text smoothing on different benchmarks in a low-resource regime.\nExperimental results show that text smoothing outperforms various mainstream\ndata augmentation methods by a substantial margin.

    "abstract": "With the rapid progress of generation technology, it has become necessary to\nattribute the origin of fake images. Existing works on fake image attribution\nperform multi-class classification on several Generative Adversarial Network\n(GAN) models and obtain high accuracies. While encouraging, these works are\nrestricted to model-level attribution, only capable of handling images\ngenerated by seen models with a specific seed, loss and dataset, which is\nlimited in real-world scenarios when fake images may be generated by privately\ntrained models. This motivates us to ask whether it is possible to attribute\nfake images to the source models' architectures even if they are finetuned or\nretrained under different configurations. In this work, we present the first\nstudy on \\textit{Deepfake Network Architecture Attribution} to attribute fake\nimages on architecture-level. Based on an observation that GAN architecture is\nlikely to leave globally consistent fingerprints while traces left by model\nweights vary in different regions, we provide a simple yet effective solution\nnamed DNA-Det for this problem.

Since LiDAR and stereo camera are widely used for\nsensor data fusion on automated driving vehicles, their extrinsic calibration\nis highly important. However, most of the LiDAR and stereo camera calibration\napproaches are mainly target-based and therefore time consuming. Even the newly\ndeveloped targetless approaches in last years are either inaccurate or\nunsuitable for driving platforms.\nTo address those problems, we introduce TEScalib. By applying a 3D mesh\nreconstruction-based point cloud registration, the geometric information is\nused to estimate the LiDAR to stereo camera extrinsic parameters accurately and\nrobustly. To calibrate the stereo camera, a photometric error function is\nbuilded and the LiDAR depth is involved to transform key points from one camera\nto another. During driving, these two parts are processed iteratively. Besides\nthat, we also propose an uncertainty analysis for reflecting the reliability of\nthe estimated extrinsic parameters. Our TEScalib approach evaluated on the\nKITTI dataset achieves very promising results.",

    "abstract": "The Large-scale 3D reconstruction, texturing and semantic mapping are\nnowadays widely used for automated driving vehicles, virtual reality and\nautomatic data generation. However, most approaches are developed for RGB-D\ncameras with colored dense point clouds and not suitable for large-scale\noutdoor environments using sparse LiDAR point clouds. Since a 3D surface can be\nusually observed from multiple camera images with different view poses, an\noptimal image patch selection for the texturing and an optimal semantic class\nestimation for the semantic mapping are still challenging.\nTo address these problems, we propose a novel 3D reconstruction, texturing\nand semantic mapping system using LiDAR and camera sensors. An Adaptive\nTruncated Signed Distance Function is introduced to describe surfaces\nimplicitly, which can deal with different LiDAR point sparsities and improve\nmodel quality. The from this implicit function extracted triangle mesh map is\nthen textured from a series of registered camera images by applying an optimal\nimage patch selection strategy. Besides that, a Markov Random Field-based data\nfusion approach is proposed to estimate the optimal semantic class for each\ntriangle mesh. Our approach is evaluated on a synthetic dataset, the KITTI\ndataset and a dataset recorded with our experimental vehicle. The results show\nthat the 3D models generated using our approach are more accurate in comparison\nto using other state-of-the-art approaches.

The LSTM is fed the close price, which is the\nprice that the currency has at the end of the day, so it can learn from those\nvalues. The notebook creates two sets: a training set and a test set to assess\nthe accuracy of the results.\nThe data is then normalized using manual min-max scaling so that the model\ndoes not experience any bias; this also enhances the performance of the model.\nThen, the model is trained using three layers -- an LSTM, dropout, and dense\nlayer-minimizing the loss through 50 epochs of training; from this training, a\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) is produced and fitted to the training set.\nAdditionally, a graph of the loss over each epoch is produced, with the loss\nminimizing over time. Finally, the notebook plots a line graph of the actual\ncurrency price in red and the predicted price in blue. The process is then\nrepeated for several more cryptocurrencies to compare prediction models. The\nparameters for the LSTM, such as number of epochs and batch size, are tweaked\nto try and minimize the root mean square error.",

There are different\ntools that facilitate the creation of such bindings. We present a short study\nthat compares three main tools, which leads to the tool of choice. The\nimplementation of algorithms and data structures in computational geometry\npresents tremendous difficulties, such as obtaining robust software despite the\nuse of (inexact) floating point arithmetic, found in standard hardware, and\nmeticulous handling of all degenerate cases, which typically are in abundance.\nThe code of CGAL extensively uses function and class templates in order to\nhandle these difficulties, which implies that the programmer has to make many\nchoices that are resolved during compile time (of the C++ modules). While\nbindings take effect at run time (of the Python code), the type of the C++\nobjects that are bound must be known when the bindings are generated, that is,\nwhen they are compiled. The types of the bound objects are instances\n(instantiated types) of C++ function and class templates. The number of object\ntypes that can potentially be bound, in implementation of generic\ncomputational-geometry algorithms, is enormous; thus, the generation of the\nbindings for all these types in advance is practically impossible. Often there\nare several choices to make, resulting in a prohibitively large number of\ncombinations. We present a system that rapidly generates bindings for desired\nobject types according to user prescriptions, which enables the convenient use\nof any subset of bound object types concurrently.

A\nrecently proposed projection-based approach takes the fisheye projection into\naccount to improve fisheye motion compensation. However, the approach does not\nconsider the large field of view of fisheye lenses that requires the\nconsideration of different motion planes in 3D space. We propose a novel\nviewport-adaptive motion compensation technique that applies the motion vectors\nin different perspective viewports in order to realize these motion planes.\nThereby, some pixels are mapped to so-called virtual image planes and require\nspecial treatment to obtain reliable mappings between the perspective viewports\nand the original fisheye image. While the state-of-the-art ultra wide-angle\ncompensation is sufficiently accurate, we propose a virtual image plane\ncompensation that leads to perfect mappings.

Detecting software partial anomalies in complex\nsystems at runtime can assist with handling unintended software behaviors,\navoiding catastrophic software failures and improving software runtime\navailability. These detection techniques aim to identify the manifestation of\nfaults (anomalies) before they ultimately lead to unavoidable failures, thus,\nsupporting the following runtime fault-tolerant techniques. In this work, we\npropose a novel anomaly detection method named DistAD, which is based on the\ndistribution of software runtime dynamic execution traces. Unlike other\nexisting works using key performance indicators, the execution trace is\ncollected during runtime via intrusive instrumentation. Instrumentation are\ncontrolled following a sampling mechanism to avoid excessive overheads.\nBi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), an architecture of Recurrent\nNeural Network (RNN) is used to achieve the anomaly detection. The whole\nframework is constructed under a One-Class Neural Network (OCNN) learning mode\nwhich can help eliminate the limits of lacking for enough labeled samples and\nthe data imbalance issues. A series of controlled experiments are conducted on\na widely used database system named Cassandra to prove the validity and\nfeasibility of the proposed method. Overheads brought about by the intrusive\nprobing are also evaluated. The results show that DistAD can achieve more than\n70% accuracy and 90% recall (in normal states) with no more than 2 times\noverheads compared with unmonitored executions.",

In this\nwork, we propose to use a GFlowNet as an alternative to MCMC for approximating\nthe posterior distribution over the structure of Bayesian networks, given a\ndataset of observations. Generating a sample DAG from this approximate\ndistribution is viewed as a sequential decision problem, where the graph is\nconstructed one edge at a time, based on learned transition probabilities.\nThrough evaluation on both simulated and real data, we show that our approach,\ncalled DAG-GFlowNet, provides an accurate approximation of the posterior over\nDAGs, and it compares favorably against other methods based on MCMC or\nvariational inference.",

Therefore,\ndeep learning models have been proposed to facilitate this process. Existing\napproaches utilize a two-stage pipeline: the detection stage for identifying\nthe locations of potential mitotic cells and the classification stage for\nrefining prediction confidences. However, this pipeline formulation can lead to\ninconsistencies in the classification stage due to the poor prediction quality\nof the detection stage and the mismatches in training data distributions\nbetween the two stages. In this study, we propose a Refine Cascade Network\n(ReCasNet), an enhanced deep learning pipeline that mitigates the\naforementioned problems with three improvements. First, window relocation was\nused to reduce the number of poor quality false positives generated during the\ndetection stage. Second, object re-cropping was performed with another deep\nlearning model to adjust poorly centered objects. Third, improved data\nselection strategies were introduced during the classification stage to reduce\nthe mismatches in training data distributions. ReCasNet was evaluated on two\nlarge-scale mitotic figure recognition datasets, canine cutaneous mast cell\ntumor (CCMCT) and canine mammary carcinoma (CMC), which resulted in up to 4.8%\npercentage point improvements in the F1 scores for mitotic cell detection and\n44.1% reductions in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for MC prediction.\nTechniques that underlie ReCasNet can be generalized to other two-stage object\ndetection networks and should contribute to improving the performances of deep\nlearning models in broad digital pathology applications.",

Coupling terms in the dynamics of an inertial pair, which is\nlinked to each other through a passive frictional contact, is nontrivial and,\nfor a long time, remained less studied. This problem is especially demanding\nfrom a viewpoint of the interaction forces and motion states. This paper\nintroduces a generalized problem of relative motion in systems with an\nunbounded (i.e. free of motion constraints) frictional interface, while\nassuming a classical Coulomb friction with discontinuity at the velocity zero\ncrossing. We formulate the motion dynamics in a closed form of ordinary\ndifferential equations, which include the sign operator for mapping both the\nCoulomb friction and switching conditions, and discuss their validity in the\ngeneralized force and motion coordinates. Here the system with one active\ndegree of freedom (meaning a driving body) and one passive degree of freedom\n(meaning a driven body) is studied. We analyze and demonstrate the global\nconvergence of trajectories for a free system case, i.e. without an external\ncontrol. An illustrative case study of solutions is presented for a harmonic\noscillator, which has a friction-coupled second mass not connected (or\njoint-linked) to the ground.

We find that the modular design of a network significantly\nincreases sample efficiency in reinforcement learning and few-shot\ngeneralisation in supervised learning, compared to baselines with fully shared,\ntask-specific, or conditionally generated parameters where knowledge is\nentangled across tasks. In addition, we show how discrete skills help\ninterpretability, as they yield an explicit hierarchy of tasks.",

    "abstract": "Android malware is a continuously expanding threat to billions of mobile\nusers around the globe. Detection systems are updated constantly to address\nthese threats. However, a backlash takes the form of evasion attacks, in which\nan adversary changes malicious samples such that those samples will be\nmisclassified as benign. This paper fully inspects a well-known Android malware\ndetection system, MaMaDroid, which analyzes the control flow graph of the\napplication. Changes to the portion of benign samples in the train set and\nmodels are considered to see their effect on the classifier. The changes in the\nratio between benign and malicious samples have a clear effect on each one of\nthe models, resulting in a decrease of more than 40% in their detection rate.\nMoreover, adopted ML models are implemented as well, including 5-NN, Decision\nTree, and Adaboost. Exploration of the six models reveals a typical behavior in\ndifferent cases, of tree-based models and distance-based models. Moreover,\nthree novel attacks that manipulate the CFG and their detection rates are\ndescribed for each one of the targeted models. The attacks decrease the\ndetection rate of most of the models to 0%, with regards to different ratios of\nbenign to malicious apps. As a result, a new version of MaMaDroid is\nengineered. This model fuses the CFG of the app and static analysis of features\nof the app. This improved model is proved to be robust against evasion attacks\ntargeting both CFG-based models and static analysis models, achieving a\ndetection rate of more than 90% against each one of the attacks.",

    "abstract": "Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) offer a vast amount of storage space at\ncompetitive prices to cope with the growing demand for digital data storage.\nDual deduplication is a recent framework designed to improve data compression\non the CSP while keeping clients' data private from the CSP. To achieve this,\nclients perform lightweight information-theoretic transformations to their data\nprior to upload. We investigate the effectiveness of dual deduplication, and\npropose an improvement for the existing state-of-the-art method. We name our\nproposal Bonsai as it aims at reducing storage fingerprint and improving\nscalability. In detail, Bonsai achieves (1) significant reduction in client\nstorage, (2) reduction in total required storage (client + CSP), and (3)\nreducing the deduplication time on the CSP. Our experiments show that Bonsai\nachieves compression rates of 68\\% on the cloud and 5\\% on the client, while\nallowing the cloud to identify deduplications in a time-efficient manner. We\nalso show that combining our method with universal compressors in the cloud,\ne.g., Brotli, can yield better overall compression on the data compared to only\napplying the universal compressor or plain Bonsai. Finally, we show that Bonsai\nand its variants provide sufficient privacy against an honest-but-curious CPS\nthat knows the distribution of the Clients' original data.",

    "abstract": "Detecting the positions of human hands and objects-in-contact (hand-object\ndetection) in each video frame is vital for understanding human activities from\nvideos. For training an object detector, a method called Mixup, which overlays\ntwo training images to mitigate data bias, has been empirically shown to be\neffective for data augmentation. However, in hand-object detection, mixing two\nhand-manipulation images produces unintended biases, e.g., the concentration of\nhands and objects in a specific region degrades the ability of the hand-object\ndetector to identify object boundaries. We propose a data-augmentation method\ncalled Background Mixup that leverages data-mixing regularization while\nreducing the unintended effects in hand-object detection. Instead of mixing two\nimages where a hand and an object in contact appear, we mix a target training\nimage with background images without hands and objects-in-contact extracted\nfrom external image sources, and use the mixed images for training the\ndetector. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively\nreduce false positives and improve the performance of hand-object detection in\nboth supervised and semi-supervised learning settings.",

Due to the\noverwhelming popularity of npm, it has become a prime target for malicious\nactors, who publish new packages or compromise existing packages to introduce\nmalware that tampers with or exfiltrates sensitive data from users who install\neither these packages or any package that (transitively) depends on them.\nDefending against such attacks is essential to maintaining the integrity of the\nsoftware supply chain, but the sheer volume of package updates makes\ncomprehensive manual review infeasible.\nWe present Amalfi, a machine-learning based approach for automatically\ndetecting potentially malicious packages comprised of three complementary\ntechniques. We start with classifiers trained on known examples of malicious\nand benign packages. If a package is flagged as malicious by a classifier, we\nthen check whether it includes metadata about its source repository, and if so\nwhether the package can be reproduced from its source code. Packages that are\nreproducible from source are not usually malicious, so this step allows us to\nweed out false positives. Finally, we also employ a simple textual\nclone-detection technique to identify copies of malicious packages that may\nhave been missed by the classifiers, reducing the number of false negatives.\nAmalfi improves on the state of the art in that it is lightweight, requiring\nonly a few seconds per package to extract features and run the classifiers, and\ngives good results in practice: running it on 96287 package versions published\nover the course of one week, we were able to identify 95 previously unknown\nmalware samples, with a manageable number of false positives.",

In particular, we study two specific settings of sampling where\nthe convex potential is either semi-smooth or in composite form as the sum of a\nsmooth component and a semi-smooth component. To overcome the challenges caused\nby the non-smoothness, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that\nresembles proximal methods in optimization for these sampling tasks. The key\ncomponent of our method is a sampling scheme for a quadratically regularized\ntarget potential. This scheme relies on rejection sampling with a carefully\ndesigned Gaussian proposal whose center is an approximate minimizer of the\nregularized potential. We develop a novel technique (a modified Gaussian\nintegral) to bound the complexity of this rejection sampling scheme in spite of\nthe non-smoothness in the potentials. We then combine this scheme with the\nalternating sampling framework (ASF), which uses Gibbs sampling on an augmented\ndistribution, to accomplish the two settings of sampling tasks we consider.\nFurthermore, by combining the complexity bound of the rejection sampling we\ndevelop and the remarkable convergence properties of ASF discovered recently,\nwe are able to establish several non-asymptotic complexity bounds for our\nalgorithm, in terms of the total number of queries of subgradient of the target\npotential.

Our results show improvements on\nshared memory, and we achieve 14x speedup from 4 to 64 nodes for the\nLiveJournal1 graph on distributed memory. Moreover, we demonstrate how caching\nremote accesses reduces total running time by up to 73% with respect to a\nnon-cached version. Finally, we compare our implementation to TriC, the 2020\ngraph champion paper, and achieve up to 100x faster results for scale-free\ngraphs.",

We can accurately\npredict a~pedestrian's future perceptions within relevant time horizons.

    "abstract": "For an artificial intelligence (AI) to be aligned with human values (or human\npreferences), it must first learn those values. AI systems that are trained on\nhuman behavior, risk miscategorising human irrationalities as human values --\nand then optimising for these irrationalities. Simply learning human values\nstill carries risks: AI learning them will inevitably also gain information on\nhuman irrationalities and human behaviour/policy. Both of these can be\ndangerous: knowing human policy allows an AI to become generically more\npowerful (whether it is partially aligned or not aligned at all), while\nlearning human irrationalities allows it to exploit humans without needing to\nprovide value in return. This paper analyses the danger in developing\nartificial intelligence that learns about human irrationalities and human\npolicy, and constructs a model recommendation system with various levels of\ninformation about human biases, human policy, and human values. It concludes\nthat, whatever the power and knowledge of the AI, it is more dangerous for it\nto know human irrationalities than human values. Thus it is better for the AI\nto learn human values directly, rather than learning human biases and then\ndeducing values from behaviour.",

While fitness apps are becoming popular, they\nlack the functionality to detect errors in workout form. Detecting such errors\nnaturally requires estimating users' body pose.

However, when the training data is corrupted, it has been\nwell-known that over-parameterized networks tend to overfit and do not\ngeneralize. In this work, we propose a principled approach for robust training\nof over-parameterized deep networks in classification tasks where a proportion\nof training labels are corrupted. The main idea is yet very simple: label noise\nis sparse and incoherent with the network learned from clean data, so we model\nthe noise and learn to separate it from the data. Specifically, we model the\nlabel noise via another sparse over-parameterization term, and exploit implicit\nalgorithmic regularizations to recover and separate the underlying corruptions.\nRemarkably, when trained using such a simple method in practice, we demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art test accuracy against label noise on a variety of real\ndatasets. Furthermore, our experimental results are corroborated by theory on\nsimplified linear models, showing that exact separation between sparse noise\nand low-rank data can be achieved under incoherent conditions. The work opens\nmany interesting directions for improving over-parameterized models by using\nsparse over-parameterization and implicit regularization.",

    "title": "Learning Semantic Segmentation from Multiple Datasets with Label Shifts",
    "abstract": "With increasing applications of semantic segmentation, numerous datasets have\nbeen proposed in the past few years. Yet labeling remains expensive, thus, it\nis desirable to jointly train models across aggregations of datasets to enhance\ndata volume and diversity. However, label spaces differ across datasets and may\neven be in conflict with one another. This paper proposes UniSeg, an effective\napproach to automatically train models across multiple datasets with differing\nlabel spaces, without any manual relabeling efforts. Specifically, we propose\ntwo losses that account for conflicting and co-occurring labels to achieve\nbetter generalization performance in unseen domains. First, a gradient conflict\nin training due to mismatched label spaces is identified and a\nclass-independent binary cross-entropy loss is proposed to alleviate such label\nconflicts. Second, a loss function that considers class-relationships across\ndatasets is proposed for a better multi-dataset training scheme. Extensive\nquantitative and qualitative analyses on road-scene datasets show that UniSeg\nimproves over multi-dataset baselines, especially on unseen datasets, e.g.,\nachieving more than 8% gain in IoU on KITTI averaged over all the settings.",

    "abstract": "This article aims to use graphic engines to simulate a large number of\ntraining data that have free annotations and possibly strongly resemble to\nreal-world data. Between synthetic and real, a two-level domain gap exists,\ninvolving content level and appearance level. While the latter is concerned\nwith appearance style, the former problem arises from a different mechanism,\ni.e., content mismatch in attributes such as camera viewpoint, object placement\nand lighting conditions. In contrast to the widely-studied appearance-level\ngap, the content-level discrepancy has not been broadly studied. To address the\ncontent-level misalignment, we propose an attribute descent approach that\nautomatically optimizes engine attributes to enable synthetic data to\napproximate real-world data. We verify our method on object-centric tasks,\nwherein an object takes up a major portion of an image. In these tasks, the\nsearch space is relatively small, and the optimization of each attribute yields\nsufficiently obvious supervision signals. We collect a new synthetic asset\nVehicleX, and reformat and reuse existing the synthetic assets ObjectX and\nPersonX. Extensive experiments on image classification and object\nre-identification confirm that adapted synthetic data can be effectively used\nin three scenarios: training with synthetic data only, training data\naugmentation and numerically understanding dataset content.",

    "abstract": "Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) rely upon the iterative optimization of\na parameterized unitary circuit with respect to an objective function. Since\nquantum machines are noisy and expensive resources, it is imperative to choose\na VQA's ansatz appropriately and its initial parameters to be close to optimal.\nThis work tackles the problem of finding initial ansatz parameters by\nproposing CAFQA, a Clifford ansatz for quantum accuracy. The CAFQA ansatz is a\nhardware-efficient circuit built with only Clifford gates. In this ansatz, the\ninitial parameters for the tunable gates are chosen by searching efficiently\nthrough the Clifford parameter space via classical simulation, thereby\nproducing a suitable stabilizer state. The stabilizer states produced are shown\nto always equal or outperform traditional classical initialization (e.g.,\nHartree-Fock), and often produce high accuracy estimations prior to quantum\nexploration. Furthermore, the technique is classically suited since a) Clifford\ncircuits can be exactly simulated classically in polynomial time and b) the\ndiscrete Clifford space, while scaling exponentially in the number of qubits,\nis searched efficiently via Bayesian Optimization.\nFor the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) task of molecular ground state\nenergy estimation up to 20 qubits, CAFQA's Clifford Ansatz achieves a mean\naccuracy of near 99%, recovering as much as 99.99% of the correlation energy\nover Hartree-Fock. Notably, the scalability of the approach allows for\npreliminary ground state energy estimation of the challenging Chromium dimer\nwith an accuracy greater than Hartree-Fock. With CAFQA's initialization, VQA\nconvergence is accelerated by a factor of 2.5x.\nIn all, this work shows that stabilizer states are an accurate ansatz\ninitialization for VQAs. Furthermore, it highlights the potential for\nquantum-inspired classical techniques to support VQAs.",

From a numerical analysis perspective, our method has\nseveral advantages: it is meshfree, preserves the gradient flow structure of\nthe underlying PDE, converges in arbitrary dimension, and captures the correct\nasymptotic behavior in simulations.\nThat our method succeeds in capturing the long time behavior of WPME is\nsignificant from the perspective of related problems in quantization.

In this way, our method has natural\napplications to multi-agent coverage algorithms and sampling probability\nmeasures.\nA specific case of our method corresponds exactly to the mean-field dynamics\nof training a two-layer neural network for a radial basis function activation\nfunction. From this perspective, our convergence result shows that, in the over\nparametrized regime and as the variance of the radial basis functions goes to\nzero, the continuum limit is given by WPME.

    "abstract": "Many research works indicate that EEG bands, specifically the alpha and theta\nbands, have been potentially helpful cognitive load indicators. However,\nminimal research exists to validate this claim. This study aims to assess and\nanalyze the impact of the alpha-to-theta and the theta-to-alpha band ratios on\nsupporting the creation of models capable of discriminating self-reported\nperceptions of mental workload. A dataset of raw EEG data was utilized in which\n48 subjects performed a resting activity and an induced task demanding exercise\nin the form of a multitasking SIMKAP test. Band ratios were devised from\nfrontal and parietal electrode clusters. Building and model testing was done\nwith high-level independent features from the frequency and temporal domains\nextracted from the computed ratios over time. Target features for model\ntraining were extracted from the subjective ratings collected after resting and\ntask demand activities. Models were built by employing Logistic Regression,\nSupport Vector Machines and Decision Trees and were evaluated with performance\nmeasures including accuracy, recall, precision and f1-score. The results\nindicate high classification accuracy of those models trained with the\nhigh-level features extracted from the alpha-to-theta ratios and theta-to-alpha\nratios. Preliminary results also show that models trained with logistic\nregression and support vector machines can accurately classify self-reported\nperceptions of mental workload. This research contributes to the body of\nknowledge by demonstrating the richness of the information in the temporal,\nspectral and statistical domains extracted from the alpha-to-theta and\ntheta-to-alpha EEG band ratios for the discrimination of self-reported\nperceptions of mental workload.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of self-supervised learning in the field of wearables-based\nhuman activity recognition (HAR) has opened up opportunities to tackle the most\npressing challenges in the field, namely to exploit unlabeled data to derive\nreliable recognition systems from only small amounts of labeled training\nsamples. Furthermore, self-supervised methods enable a host of new application\ndomains such as, for example, domain adaptation and transfer across sensor\npositions, activities etc. As such, self-supervision, i.e., the paradigm of\n'pretrain-then-finetune' has the potential to become a strong alternative to\nthe predominant end-to-end training approaches, let alone the classic activity\nrecognition chain with hand-crafted features of sensor data. Recently a number\nof contributions have been made that introduced self-supervised learning into\nthe field of HAR, including, Multi-task self-supervision, Masked\nReconstruction, CPC to name but a few. With the initial success of these\nmethods, the time has come for a systematic inventory and analysis of the\npotential self-supervised learning has for the field. This paper provides\nexactly that. We assess the progress of self-supervised HAR research by\nintroducing a framework that performs a multi-faceted exploration of model\nperformance. We organize the framework into three dimensions, each containing\nthree constituent criteria, and utilize it to assess state-of-the-art\nself-supervised learning methods in a large empirical study on a curated set of\nnine diverse benchmarks. This exploration leads us to the formulation of\ninsights into the properties of these techniques and to establish their value\ntowards learning representations for diverse scenarios. Based on our findings\nwe call upon the community to join our efforts and to contribute towards\nshaping the evaluation of the ongoing paradigm change in modeling human\nactivities from body-worn sensor data.",

Moreover, it is promising that lots\nof networks can be deployed on wearable devices. An increasing number of\nmethods can be used to realize ECG signal classification for the sake of\narrhythmia detection. However, the existing neural networks proposed for\narrhythmia detection are not hardware-friendly enough due to a remarkable\nquantity of parameters resulting in memory and power consumption.\nIn this paper, we present a 1-D adaptive loss-aware quantization, achieving a\nhigh compression rate that reduces memory consumption by 23.36 times. In order\nto adapt to our compression method, we need a smaller and simpler network. We\npropose a 17 layer end-to-end neural network classifier to classify 17\ndifferent rhythm classes trained on the MIT-BIH dataset, realizing a\nclassification accuracy of 93.5%, which is higher than most existing methods.\nDue to the adaptive bitwidth method making important layers get more attention\nand offered a chance to prune useless parameters, the proposed quantization\nmethod avoids accuracy degradation. It even improves the accuracy rate, which\nis 95.84%, 2.34% higher than before.

    "abstract": "This work presents a triboelectric nanogenerator-based (TENG) therapeutic\nstress ball to provide gesture monitoring and physiological data on patients\nrequiring physical therapy of various degrees. The device utilizes a 5-layer\nstack of silicone and braided silver-coated nylon rope electrodes to create a\nsensor network that monitors 40-points across the surface of a semi-spherical\nprototype. A modified version of a standard ECG circuit was utilized to provide\nproper loading, noise rejection, filtering, and phase of the TENG signals along\nwith multiplexing of the many electrodes. All system components were selected\nwith a final embedded system in mind. Testing of the device was conducted\nutilizing an Arduino Uno and an EVAL-AD5940BIOZ evaluation board for\nelectrodermal activity for stress and/or pain after exercise. An accelerometer\nwas included for device activation and hand tremor detection. Upon testing, the\nself-powered TENG sensors produce positive impulses upon contact and negative\nimpulses upon release of contact from the surface of the ball. Furthermore,\nfinger removal detection was demonstrated by capturing the associated negative\nimpulse by maintaining the bipolar signal in our conditioning circuit. EDA\nresults indicate silver-coated nylon as a potentially good dry-electrode which\ncan be used with even more electrodes for bio-impedance or ECG capture to\nfurther expand the device functionality. A MATLAB-based GUI was designed to\nprovide the user with data tracking and visual monitoring of the data via\nserial communication from the microcontrollers. Finally, it should be noted\nthat this provides a means for low-cost low-power gesture tracking without the\nuse of flexible capacitive grid arrays and provides the user with a pleasant\ntactile experience that one expects form a stress ball due to its unique\nmaterial design.",

This paper proposes a novel EEG-based emotion recognition\nmodel called the domain adversarial graph attention model (DAGAM). The basic\nidea is to generate a graph to model multichannel EEG signals using biological\ntopology. Graph theory can topologically describe and analyze relationships and\nmutual dependency between channels of EEG. Then, unlike other graph\nconvolutional networks, self-attention pooling is applied to benefit salient\nEEG feature extraction from the graph, which effectively improves the\nperformance. Finally, after graph pooling, the domain adversarial based on the\ngraph is employed to identify and handle EEG variation across subjects,\nefficiently reaching good generalizability. We conduct extensive evaluations on\ntwo benchmark datasets (SEED and SEED IV) and obtain state-of-the-art results\nin subject-independent emotion recognition. Our model boosts the SEED accuracy\nto 92.59% (4.69% improvement) with the lowest standard deviation of 3.21%\n(2.92% decrements) and SEED IV accuracy to 80.74% (6.90% improvement) with the\nlowest standard deviation of 4.14% (3.88% decrements) respectively.",

On the other\nside, developments in transfer learning would benefit significantly from a\nreal-world benchmark with immediate practical application. Therefore, we pick\nelectroencephalography (EEG) as an exemplar for what makes biosignal machine\nlearning hard. We design two transfer learning challenges around diagnostics\nand Brain-Computer-Interfacing (BCI), that have to be solved in the face of low\nsignal-to-noise ratios, major variability among subjects, differences in the\ndata recording sessions and techniques, and even between the specific BCI tasks\nrecorded in the dataset.

The approach consists in learning\na prior image model by training a deep neural network (DNN) as a denoiser, and\nsubstituting it for the handcrafted proximal regularization operator of an\noptimization algorithm. The proposed AIRI (\"AI for Regularization in\nRadio-Interferometric Imaging\") framework, for imaging complex intensity\nstructure with diffuse and faint emission, inherits the robustness and\ninterpretability of optimization, and the learning power and speed of networks.\nOur approach relies on three steps. Firstly, we design a low dynamic range\ndatabase for supervised training from optical intensity images. Secondly, we\ntrain a DNN denoiser with basic architecture ensuring positivity of the output\nimage, at a noise level inferred from the signal-to-noise ratio of the data. We\nuse either $\\ell_2$ or $\\ell_1$ training losses, enhanced with a\nnonexpansiveness term ensuring algorithm convergence, and including on-the-fly\ndatabase dynamic range enhancement via exponentiation. Thirdly, we plug the\nlearned denoiser into the forward-backward optimization algorithm, resulting in\na simple iterative structure alternating a denoising step with a\ngradient-descent data-fidelity step. The resulting AIRI-$\\ell_2$ and\nAIRI-$\\ell_1$ were validated against CLEAN and optimization algorithms of the\nSARA family, propelled by the \"average sparsity\" proximal regularization\noperator. Simulation results show that these first AIRI incarnations are\ncompetitive in imaging quality with SARA and its unconstrained\nforward-backward-based version uSARA, while providing significant acceleration.\nCLEAN remains faster but offers lower reconstruction quality.",

This paper derives\narbitrary order finite element exterior calculus spatial discretizations for\nthe two-dimensional (2D) Navier-Stokes and drift-reduced magnetohydrodynamic\nequations that conserve both energy and enstrophy to machine precision when\ncoupled with generally symplectic time-integration methods. Both continuous and\ndiscontinuous-Galerkin (DG) weak formulations can ensure conservation, but only\ngenerally symplectic time integration methods, such as the implicit midpoint\nmethod, permit exact conservation in time. Moreover, the symplectic implicit\nmidpoint method yields an order of magnitude speedup over explicit schemes. The\nmethods are implemented using the MFEM library and the solutions are verified\nfor an extensive suite of 2D neutral fluid turbulence test problems. Numerical\nsolutions are verified via comparison to a semi-analytic linear eigensolver as\nwell as to the finite difference Global Drift Ballooning (GDB) code. However,\nit is found that turbulent simulations that conserve both energy and enstrophy\ntend to have too much power at high wavenumber and that this part of the\nspectrum should be controlled by reintroducing artificial dissipation. The DG\nformulation allows upwinding of the advection operator which dissipates\nenstrophy while still maintaining conservation of energy.

    "abstract": "Variational inference is a technique for approximating intractable posterior\ndistributions in order to quantify the uncertainty of machine learning.\nAlthough the unimodal Gaussian distribution is usually chosen as a parametric\ndistribution, it hardly approximates the multimodality. In this paper, we\nemploy the Gaussian mixture distribution as a parametric distribution. A main\ndifficulty of variational inference with the Gaussian mixture is how to\napproximate the entropy of the Gaussian mixture. We approximate the entropy of\nthe Gaussian mixture as the sum of the entropy of the unimodal Gaussian, which\ncan be analytically calculated. In addition, we theoretically analyze the\napproximation error between the true entropy and approximated one in order to\nreveal when our approximation works well. Specifically, the approximation error\nis controlled by the ratios of the distances between the means to the sum of\nthe variances of the Gaussian mixture, and it converges to zero when the ratios\ngo to infinity. This situation seems to be more likely to occur in higher\ndimensional weight spaces because of the curse of dimensionality. Therefore,\nour result guarantees that our approximation works well, for example, in neural\nnetworks that assume a large number of weights.",

    "abstract": "Non-autoregressive text to speech (NAR-TTS) models have attracted much\nattention from both academia and industry due to their fast generation speed.\nOne limitation of NAR-TTS models is that they ignore the correlation in time\nand frequency domains while generating speech mel-spectrograms, and thus cause\nblurry and over-smoothed results. In this work, we revisit this over-smoothing\nproblem from a novel perspective: the degree of over-smoothness is determined\nby the gap between the complexity of data distributions and the capability of\nmodeling methods. Both simplifying data distributions and improving modeling\nmethods can alleviate the problem. Accordingly, we first study methods reducing\nthe complexity of data distributions. Then we conduct a comprehensive study on\nNAR-TTS models that use some advanced modeling methods. Based on these studies,\nwe find that 1) methods that provide additional condition inputs reduce the\ncomplexity of data distributions to model, thus alleviating the over-smoothing\nproblem and achieving better voice quality. 2) Among advanced modeling methods,\nLaplacian mixture loss performs well at modeling multimodal distributions and\nenjoys its simplicity, while GAN and Glow achieve the best voice quality while\nsuffering from increased training or model complexity. 3) The two categories of\nmethods can be combined to further alleviate the over-smoothness and improve\nthe voice quality. 4) Our experiments on the multi-speaker dataset lead to\nsimilar conclusions as above and providing more variance information can reduce\nthe difficulty of modeling the target data distribution and alleviate the\nrequirements for model capacity.",

Two recurrent neural networks are applied\nfor the temporal advancement of flow data in the reduced latent data space, a\nreservoir computing model in the form of an echo state network and a recurrent\ngated unit. Thereby, the present work exploits the modular combination of three\ndifferent machine learning algorithms to build a fully data-driven and reduced\nmodel for the dynamics of the turbulent heat transfer in a complex thermally\ndriven flow. The convolutional autoencoder with 12 hidden layers is able to\nreduce the dimensionality of the turbulence data to about 0.2 \\% of their\noriginal size. Our results indicate a fairly good accuracy in the first- and\nsecond-order statistics of the convective heat flux. The algorithm is also able\nto reproduce the intermittent plume-mixing dynamics at the upper edges of the\nthermal boundary layers with some deviations. The same holds for the\nprobability density function of the local convective heat flux with differences\nin the far tails. Furthermore, we demonstrate the noise resilience of the\nframework which suggests the present model might be applicable as a reduced\ndynamical model that delivers transport fluxes and their variations to the\ncoarse grid cells of larger-scale computational models, such as global\ncirculation models for the atmosphere and ocean.",

In this paper we introduce a novel\nidea of using EIT in microelectrodes during Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)\nsurgery in order to obtain an image of the electrical conductivities of the\nbrain tissues surrounding the microelectrodes. DBS is a surgical treatment\ninvolving the implantation of a medical probe inside the brain.

The reconstruction\nmethod is a two-steps method, the first solves the inverse problem with a\nlinear algorithm and the second brings the nonlinear aspects back into the\nimage. Results: The proposed method is tested on both simulation and phantom\ndata, and compared to three widely used method for EIT imaging.

In order to achieve scalable QNN learning, the\ntraining process needs to be offloaded to real quantum machines instead of\nusing exponential-cost classical simulators. One common approach to obtain QNN\ngradients is parameter shift whose cost scales linearly with the number of\nqubits. We present On-chip QNN, the first experimental demonstration of\npractical on-chip QNN training with parameter shift. Nevertheless, we find that\ndue to the significant quantum errors (noises) on real machines, gradients\nobtained from naive parameter shift have low fidelity and thus degrade the\ntraining accuracy. To this end, we further propose probabilistic gradient\npruning to firstly identify gradients with potentially large errors and then\nremove them. Specifically, small gradients have larger relative errors than\nlarge ones, thus having a higher probability to be pruned. We perform extensive\nexperiments on 5 classification tasks with 5 real quantum machines. The results\ndemonstrate that our on-chip training achieves over 90% and 60% accuracy for\n2-class and 4-class image classification tasks. The probabilistic gradient\npruning brings up to 7% QNN accuracy improvements over no pruning. Overall, we\nsuccessfully obtain similar on-chip training accuracy compared with noise-free\nsimulation but have much better training scalability.

Thermal ablation has the potential to non-invasively eliminate\ntumors and treat other medical conditions with high efficacy and better patient\noutcomes. However, it is necessary for treatment to be coupled with real time\ntemperature monitoring in order to deliver sufficient thermal dosage to the\ntarget while sparing surrounding, healthy tissues.

By leveraging\nand extracting the feature maps of each modality independently and using each\nmodalities information for cross-modal interactions, we aim to provide a\nsolution that would further increase the effectiveness of the imaging systems\nfor enabling the noninvasive intraoperative nerve identification.",

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation, which aims to automatically extract anatomical or\npathological structures, plays a key role in computer-aided diagnosis and\ndisease analysis. Despite the problem has been widely studied, existing methods\nare prone to topological errors. In medical imaging, the topology of the\nstructure, such as the kidney or lung, is usually known. Preserving the\ntopology of the structure in the segmentation process is of utmost importance\nfor accurate image analysis. In this work, a novel learning-based segmentation\nmodel is proposed. A {\\it topology-preserving segmentation network (TPSN)} is\ntrained to give an accurate segmentation result of an input image that\npreserves the prescribed topology. TPSN is a deformation-based model that\nyields a deformation map through a UNet, which takes the medical image and a\ntemplate mask as inputs. The main idea is to deform a template mask describing\nthe prescribed topology by a diffeomorphism to segment the object in the image.\nThe topology of the shape in the template mask is well preserved under the\ndiffeomorphic map. The diffeomorphic property of the map is controlled by\nintroducing a regularization term related to the Jacobian in the loss function.\nAs such, a topology-preserving segmentation result can be guaranteed.\nFurthermore, a multi-scale TPSN is developed in this paper that incorporates\nmulti-level information of images to produce more precise segmentation results.\nTo evaluate our method, we applied the 2D TPSN on Ham10000 and 3D TPSN on\nKiTS21. Experimental results illustrate our method outperforms the baseline\nUNet segmentation model with/without connected-component analysis (CCA) by both\nthe dice score and IoU score. Besides, results show that our method can produce\nreliable results even in challenging cases, where pixel-wise segmentation\nmodels by UNet and CCA fail to obtain accurate results.",

The interpretation of fetal\nbrain structures is highly subjective, expertise-driven, and requires years of\ntraining experience, limiting quality prenatal care for all pregnant mothers.\nWith recent advancement in Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically deep\nlearning (DL), assistance in precise anatomy identification through semantic\nsegmentation essential for the reliable assessment of growth and\nneurodevelopment, and detection of structural abnormalities have been proposed.\nHowever, existing works only identify certain structures (e.g., cavum septum\npellucidum, lateral ventricles, cerebellum) from either of the axial views\n(transventricular, transcerebellar), limiting the scope for a thorough\nanatomical assessment as per practice guidelines necessary for the screening of\nCNS anomalies. Further, existing works do not analyze the generalizability of\nthese DL algorithms across images from multiple ultrasound devices and centers,\nthus, limiting their real-world clinical impact. In this study, we propose a DL\nbased segmentation framework for the automated segmentation of 10 key fetal\nbrain structures from 2 axial planes from fetal brain USG images (2D).

    "abstract": "The increasing share of renewable energy sources on distribution grid level\nas well as the emerging active role of prosumers lead to both higher\ndistribution grid utilization, and at the same time greater unpredictability of\nenergy generation and consumption. This poses major problems for grid operators\nin view of, e.g., voltage stability and line (over)loading. Thus, detailed and\ncomprehensive simulation models are essential for planning future distribution\ngrid expansion in view of the expected strong electrification of society. In\nthis context, the contribution of the present paper is a new, more refined\nmethod for automated creation of large-scale detailed distribution grid models\nbased solely on publicly available GIS and statistical data. Utilizing the\nstreet layouts in Open Street Maps as potential cable routes, a graph\nrepresentation is created and complemented by residential units that are\nextracted from the same data source. This graph structure is adjusted to match\nelectrical low-voltage grid topology by solving a variation of the minimum cost\nflow linear optimization problem with provided data on secondary substations.\nIn a final step, the generated grid representation is transferred to a\nDIgSILENT PowerFactory model with photovoltaic systems. The presented workflow\nuses open source software and is fully automated and scalable that allows the\ngeneration of ready-to-use distribution grid simulation models for given 20kV\nsubstation locations and additional data on residential unit properties for\nimproved results. The performance of the developed method with respect to grid\nutilization is presented for a selected suburban residential area with power\nflow simulations for eight scenarios including current residential PV\ninstallation and a future scenario with full PV expansion.

This extends an intuition described by Nakkiran\n(2020) on a two-dimensional toy problem to realistic learning scenarios such as\nkernel ridge regression.

This is\nbecause in fairness settings, models in this class entail a particularly strong\ncausal assumption, normally only seen in a randomised controlled trial. We\nargue that in general this is unlikely to hold. Furthermore, we show in many\ncases it can be explicitly rejected due to the fact that samples are selected\nfrom a wider population.

Our RestainNet outperforms existing approaches and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance with regard to color correctness and structure\npreservation.

    "abstract": "Due to unmeasured confounding, it is often not possible to identify causal\neffects from a postulated model. Nevertheless, we can ask for partial\nidentification, which usually boils down to finding upper and lower bounds of a\ncausal quantity of interest derived from all solutions compatible with the\nencoded structural assumptions. One appealing way to derive such bounds is by\ncasting it in terms of a constrained optimization method that searches over all\ncausal models compatible with evidence, as introduced in the classic work of\nBalke and Pearl (1994) for discrete data. Although by construction this\nguarantees tight bounds, it poses a formidable computational challenge. To cope\nwith this issue, alternatives include algorithms that are not guaranteed to be\ntight, or by introducing restrictions on the class of models. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel alternative: inspired by ideas coming from belief\npropagation, we enforce compatibility between marginals of a causal model and\ndata, without constructing a global causal model. We call this collection of\nlocally consistent marginals the causal marginal polytope. As global\nindependence constraints disappear when considering small dimensional tractable\nmarginals, this also leads to a rethinking of how to elicit and express causal\nknowledge.

The best results were\nobtained with the hybrid model, resulting in a global accuracy of 93.8\\%, and\nF-scores of 0.99, 0.82, and 0.95, for healthy, mild and moderate/severe cases,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "Feature embedding methods have been proposed in literature to represent\nsequences as numeric vectors to be used in some bioinformatics investigations,\nsuch as family classification and protein structure prediction. Recent\ntheoretical results showed that the well-known Lyndon factorization preserves\ncommon factors in overlapping strings. Surprisingly, the fingerprint of a\nsequencing read, which is the sequence of lengths of consecutive factors in\nvariants of the Lyndon factorization of the read, is effective in preserving\nsequence similarities, suggesting it as basis for the definition of novels\nrepresentations of sequencing reads. We propose a novel feature embedding\nmethod for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data using the notion of\nfingerprint. We provide a theoretical and experimental framework to estimate\nthe behaviour of fingerprints and of the k-mers extracted from it, called\nk-fingers, as possible feature embeddings for sequencing reads. As a case study\nto assess the effectiveness of such embeddings, we use fingerprints to\nrepresent RNA-Seq reads and to assign them to the most likely gene from which\nthey were originated as fragments of transcripts of the gene. We provide an\nimplementation of the proposed method in the tool lyn2vec, which produces\nLyndon-based feature embeddings of sequencing reads.",

    "abstract": "Under typical growth, populations quickly loose their ability to sustain and\nselect effects (gains and losses), as, with each step, increasing variation is\nleft uncontrolled. Under (1) Unconfounded growth, in contrast, populations\npreserve their ability to determine which of their many variations is\nresponsible for gains and losses they are observing (and can, consequently,\ncarry fair selection and optimization processes). Under (2) Externally-Valid\ngrowth, observed effects generalize across populations' full range of variation\n(and populations can, consequently, expand across increasingly diverse\nconditions). The first promotes generalization of effects over populations, and\nthe second over their environments. These alternative growth patterns allow\nsystems in complex environments to create sustainable environments for growth,\nfrom their chosen spatial distribution patterns.\nWe consider the full growth, from 1840, of American cities and economy. We\nuse billions of individual-level census records, organized in spatial levels\nranging from the street level all the way to the national. We demonstrate\npopulations' combinatorial thresholds for sustainable growth, across locations\nand levels. The resulting model unifies popular mathematical growth theories,\nand reveal new connections to the Fibonacci-Golden ratio, Cooperative\nGame-Theory, Spatial Experimental-Designs, Causality, Power-laws, Hyperbolic\nGeometry, and the Pareto Principle. It, finally, makes new predictions about\nthe growth of cities, that are hard to explain with current models.",

    "abstract": "In the quantum computation verification problem, a quantum server wants to\nconvince a client that the output of evaluating a quantum circuit $C$ is some\nresult that it claims. This problem is considered very important both\ntheoretically and practically in quantum computation [arXiv:1709.06984],\n[arXiv:1704.04487], [arXiv:1209.0449]. The client is considered to be limited\nin computational power, and one desirable property is that the client can be\ncompletely classical, which leads to the classical verification of quantum\ncomputation (CVQC) problem. In terms of total time complexity of both the\nclient and the server, the fastest single-server CVQC protocol so far has\ncomplexity $O(poly(\\kappa)|C|^3)$ where $|C|$ is the size of the circuit to be\nverified, given by Mahadev [arXiv:1804.01082].\nIn this work, by developing new techniques, we give a new CVQC protocol with\ncomplexity $O(poly(\\kappa)|C|)$, which is significantly faster than existing\nprotocols. Our protocol is secure in the quantum random oracle model\n[arXiv:1008.0931] assuming the existence of noisy trapdoor claw-free functions\n[arXiv:1804.00640], which are both extensively used assumptions in quantum\ncryptography.

While multiple open-source quantum\ncompilation and circuit optimization frameworks are available, e.g. IBM Qiskit,\nCQC Tket, Google Cirq, Rigetti Quilc, PyZX, their relative performance is not\nalways clear to a quantum programmer. The growth of complexity and diversity of\nquantum circuit compilation algorithms creates a demand for a dedicated tool\nfor cross-benchmarking and profiling of inner workflow of the quantum\ncompilation stack. We present an open-source software package, Arline\nBenchmarks, that is designed to perform automated benchmarking of quantum\ncompilers with the focus on NISQ applications. The name \"Arline\" was given in\nhonour of Arline Greenbaum Feynman, the first wife of Richard Feynman, the\npioneer of quantum computing. We compared several quantum compilation\nframeworks based on a set of important metrics such as post-optimization gate\ncounts, circuit depth, hardware-dependent circuit cost function, compiler run\ntime etc. with a detailed analysis of metrics for each compilation stage. We\nperformed a variety of compiler tests for random circuits and structured\nquantum algorithms (VQE, Trotter decomposition, Grover search, Option Pricing\nvia Amplitude Estimation) for several popular quantum hardware architectures.\nLeveraging cross-platform functionality of Arline, we propose a concept of\ncomposite compilation pipeline that combines compiler-specific circuit\noptimization subroutines in a single compilation stack and finds an optimized\nsequence of compilation passes. By providing detailed insights into the\ncompilation flow of quantum compilers, Arline Benchmarks offers a valuable\ntoolkit for quantum computing researchers and software developers to gain\nadditional insights into compilers' characteristics.",
