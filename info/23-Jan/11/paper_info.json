    "title": "Network Message Field Type Classification and Recognition for Unknown  Binary Protocols",
    "abstract": "Reverse engineering of unknown network protocols based on recorded traffic\ntraces enables security analyses and debugging of undocumented network\nservices. In particular for binary protocols, existing approaches (1) lack\ncomprehensive methods to classify or determine the data type of a discovered\nsegment in a message, e.,g., a number, timestamp, or network address, that\nwould allow for a semantic interpretation and (2) have strong assumptions that\nprevent analysis of lower-layer protocols often found in IoT or mobile systems.\nIn this paper, we propose the first generic method for analyzing unknown\nmessages from binary protocols to reveal the data types in message fields. To\nthis end, we split messages into segments of bytes and use their vector\ninterpretation to calculate similarities. These can be used to create clusters\nof segments with the same type and, moreover, to recognize specific data types\nbased on the clusters' characteristics. Our extensive evaluation shows that our\nmethod provides precise classification in most cases and a\ndata-type-recognition precision of up to 100% at reasonable recall, improving\nthe state-of-the-art by a factor between 1.3 and 3.7 in realistic scenarios. We\nopen-source our implementation to facilitate follow-up works.",

    "title": "Refining Network Message Segmentation with Principal Component Analysis",
    "abstract": "Reverse engineering of undocumented protocols is a common task in security\nanalyses of networked services. The communication itself, captured in traffic\ntraces, contains much of the necessary information to perform such a protocol\nreverse engineering. The comprehension of the format of unknown messages is of\nparticular interest for binary protocols that are not human-readable. One major\nchallenge is to discover probable fields in a message as the basis for further\nanalyses. Given a set of messages, split into segments of bytes by an existing\nsegmenter, we propose a method to refine the approximation of the field\ninference. We use principle component analysis (PCA) to discover linearly\ncorrelated variance between sets of message segments. We relocate the\nboundaries of the initial coarse segmentation to more accurately match with the\ntrue fields. We perform different evaluations of our method to show its benefit\nfor the message format inference and subsequent analysis tasks from literature\nthat depend on the message format. We can achieve a median improvement of the\nmessage format accuracy across different real-world protocols by up to 100 %.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of workload requirements and increasing hardware heterogeneity\nin emerging high performance computing (HPC) systems motivate resource\ndisaggregation. Disaggregation separates servers into their constituent compute\nand memory resources so that they can be allocated as required to each\nworkload. Previous work has shown the potential of intra-rack resource\ndisaggregation, but it is not clear how to realize these gains and\ncost-effectively meet the stringent bandwidth and latency requirements of HPC\napplications. To that end, we describe how modern photonic components can be\nco-designed with modern HPC racks to implement flexible intra-rack resource\ndisaggregation and fully meet the high escape bandwidth of contemporary multi\nchip module (MCM) packages and all chip types in modern HPC racks with\nnegligible power overhead. We show how to use distributed indirect routing to\nmeet these demands without the need for significant complexity for\nreconfiguration that spatial optical switches require. We then show that\nintra-rack resource disaggregation implemented using emerging photonics and\nparallel optical wavelength-selective switches satisfies bit error rate (BER)\nand bandwidth constraints and provides an average application speedup of 23.9%\nfor 31 out-of-order CPU and 61.5% for 27 GPU benchmarks compared to a similar\nsystem that instead uses modern electronic switches for disaggregation, due to\ntheir higher latency. Using observed resource usage from a production system,\nwe estimate that an iso-performance intra-rack disaggregated HPC system using\nphotonics would require 4x fewer memory modules and 2x fewer NICs than a\nnon-disaggregated baseline.",

Prior works in vehicle anomaly\ndetection have shown that modeling interactions between agents improves\ndetection accuracy, but certain abnormal behaviors where structured road\ninformation is paramount are poorly identified, such as wrong-way and off-road\ndriving. We propose a novel unsupervised framework for highway anomaly\ndetection named Structural Attention-based Recurrent VAE (SABeR-VAE), which\nexplicitly uses the structure of the environment to aid anomaly identification.\nSpecifically, we use a vehicle self-attention module to learn the relations\namong vehicles on a road, and a separate lane-vehicle attention module to model\nthe importance of permissible lanes to aid in trajectory prediction.\nConditioned on the attention modules' outputs, a recurrent encoder-decoder\narchitecture with a stochastic Koopman operator-propagated latent space\npredicts the next states of vehicles. Our model is trained end-to-end to\nminimize prediction loss on normal vehicle behaviors, and is deployed to detect\nanomalies in (ab)normal scenarios. By combining the heterogeneous vehicle and\nlane information, SABeR-VAE and its deterministic variant, SABeR-AE, improve\nabnormal AUPR by 18% and 25% respectively on the simulated MAAD highway\ndataset. Furthermore, we show that the learned Koopman operator in SABeR-VAE\nenforces interpretable structure in the variational latent space.

Computational studies are performed which illustrate ice sheet\nproblem regimes for which the Gauss-Newton data-misfit Hessian is more\nefficiently approximated by the HODLR matrix format than the low-rank (LR)\nformat. We then demonstrate that HODLR approximations can be favorable, when\ncompared to global low-rank approximations, for large-scale problems by\nstudying the data-misfit Hessian associated to inverse problems governed by the\nStokes flow model on the Humboldt glacier and Greenland ice sheets.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, centralized Path Computation Elements (PCE) integrate control plane\nalgorithms to optimize routing and load-balancing continuously. When a link\nfails, the traffic load is automatically transferred to the remaining paths\naccording to the configuration of load-balancers. In this context, we propose a\nload-balancing method that anticipates load transfers to ensure the protection\nof traffic against any Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) failure. The main\nobjective of this approach is to make better use of bandwidth compared to\nexisting methods. It consists in reserving a minimum amount of extra bandwidth\non links so that the rerouting of traffic is guaranteed. We propose a\nnon-linear non-convex model for the problem of minimizing the bandwidth\nreservation cost. We introduce a new approximation approach based on a neural\nnetwork to convexify the problem and apply Kelley's cutting plane method to\nsolve the problem. Finally, we show that our algorithm significantly improves\nthe CPU time against a compact model solved using the SCIP solver.",

    "abstract": "Reward functions are notoriously difficult to specify, especially for tasks\nwith complex goals. Reward learning approaches attempt to infer reward\nfunctions from human feedback and preferences. Prior works on reward learning\nhave mainly focused on the performance of policies trained alongside the reward\nfunction. This practice, however, may fail to detect learned rewards that are\nnot capable of training new policies from scratch and thus do not capture the\nintended behavior. Our work focuses on demonstrating and studying the causes of\nthese relearning failures in the domain of preference-based reward learning. We\ndemonstrate with experiments in tabular and continuous control environments\nthat the severity of relearning failures can be sensitive to changes in reward\nmodel design and the trajectory dataset composition.

We find that among Alexa top 50K\nwebsites, at least 12,451 of them use CDNs and contain user login entrances.\nAmong those websites, 33% of them expose users' passwords to the CDNs, and a\npopular CDN may observe passwords from more than 40% of its customers. This\nresult suggests that if a CDN infrastructure has a security vulnerability or an\ninsider attack, many users' accounts will be at risk.

Downlink throughput prediction using machine or\ndeep learning techniques is one of the significant aspects in this direction.\nHowever existing works are limited in scope as the prediction models are\nprimarily trained using the data from a closed network under a fixed cellular\noperator. Precisely, these models are not transferable across networks of\ndifferent operators because of the vast variability in the underlying network\nconfigurations across operators, device specifications, and devices'\nresponsiveness towards an operator's network. With the help of real network\ndata, we show in this paper that the existing models get invalidated when\ntrained with the data from one network and then applied to a different network.\nFinally we propose FedPut, utilizing Federated Learning (FL) to develop the\nthroughput prediction model. We develop a novel approach called\nCross-Technology FL (CTFL) that allows distributed model training over the user\nequipment by capturing throughput variations based on devices' sensitivity\ntowards the corresponding network configurations. Rigorous evaluations show\nthat FedPut outperforms various standard baseline algorithms.

Here we present a more comprehensive set of benchmarking tests for\nevaluating the transferability of machine-learned force fields. We use a graph\nneural network (GNN)-based force field coupled with the OpenMM package to carry\nout MD simulations for Argon as a test case. Our tests include computational\nX-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) signals, which capture the density\nfluctuation at various length scales in the liquid phase, as well as phonon\ndensity-of-state in the solid phase and the liquid-solid phase transition\nbehavior. Our results show that the model can accurately capture the behavior\nof the solid phase only when the configurations from the solid phase are\nincluded in the training dataset. This underscores the importance of\nappropriately selecting the training data set when developing machine-learned\nforce fields. The tests presented in this work provide a necessary foundation\nfor the development and application of machine-learned force fields for\nmaterials simulations.",

    "abstract": "This work proposes a novel model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that\nis able to learn how to complete an unknown task having access to only a part\nof the input observation. We take inspiration from the concepts of visual\nattention and active perception that are characteristic of humans and tried to\napply them to our agent, creating a hard attention mechanism. In this\nmechanism, the model decides first which region of the input image it should\nlook at, and only after that it has access to the pixels of that region.\nCurrent RL agents do not follow this principle and we have not seen these\nmechanisms applied to the same purpose as this work. In our architecture, we\nadapt an existing model called recurrent attention model (RAM) and combine it\nwith the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. We investigate whether a\nmodel with these characteristics is capable of achieving similar performance to\nstate-of-the-art model-free RL agents that access the full input observation.\nThis analysis is made in two Atari games, Pong and SpaceInvaders, which have a\ndiscrete action space, and in CarRacing, which has a continuous action space.\nBesides assessing its performance, we also analyze the movement of the\nattention of our model and compare it with what would be an example of the\nhuman behavior. Even with such visual limitation, we show that our model\nmatches the performance of PPO+LSTM in two of the three games tested.",

Our goal is to design fair allocation algorithms that exhaust\nthe available resource budget. This is challenging in sequential settings where\ninformation on future demands is not available at the time of decision-making.\nWe formulate the problem as a discrete time Markov decision process (MDP). We\npropose a new algorithm, SAFFE, that makes fair allocations with respect to the\nentire demands revealed over the horizon by accounting for expected future\ndemands at each arrival time. The algorithm introduces regularization which\nenables the prioritization of current revealed demands over future potential\ndemands depending on the uncertainty in agents' future demands. Using the MDP\nformulation, we show that SAFFE optimizes allocations based on an upper bound\non the Nash Social Welfare fairness objective, and we bound its gap to\noptimality with the use of concentration bounds on total future demands. Using\nsynthetic and real data, we compare the performance of SAFFE against existing\napproaches and a reinforcement learning policy trained on the MDP.

    "abstract": "Empowered by deep neural networks (DNNs), Wi-Fi fingerprinting has recently\nachieved astonishing localization performance to facilitate many\nsecurity-critical applications in wireless networks, but it is inevitably\nexposed to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations can mislead DNNs to\nwrong predictions. Such vulnerability provides new security breaches to\nmalicious devices for hampering wireless network security, such as\nmalfunctioning geofencing or asset management. The prior adversarial attack on\nlocalization DNNs uses additive perturbations on channel state information\n(CSI) measurements, which is impractical in Wi-Fi transmissions. To transcend\nthis limitation, this paper presents FooLoc, which fools Wi-Fi CSI\nfingerprinting DNNs over the realistic wireless channel between the attacker\nand the victim access point (AP). We observe that though uplink CSIs are\nunknown to the attacker, the accessible downlink CSIs could be their reasonable\nsubstitutes at the same spot. We thoroughly investigate the multiplicative and\nrepetitive properties of over-the-air perturbations and devise an efficient\noptimization problem to generate imperceptible yet robust adversarial\nperturbations. We implement FooLoc using commercial Wi-Fi APs and Wireless\nOpen-Access Research Platform (WARP) v3 boards in offline and online\nexperiments, respectively. The experimental results show that FooLoc achieves\noverall attack success rates of about 70% in targeted attacks and of above 90%\nin untargeted attacks with small perturbation-to-signal ratios of about -18dB.",

    "abstract": "Tensors in the form of multilinear arrays are ubiquitous in data science\napplications. Captured real-world data, including video, hyperspectral images,\nand discretized physical systems, naturally occur as tensors and often come\nwith attendant noise. Under the additive noise model and with the assumption\nthat the underlying clean tensor has low rank, many denoising methods have been\ncreated that utilize tensor decomposition to effect denoising through low rank\ntensor approximation. However, all such decomposition methods require\nestimating the tensor rank, or related measures such as the tensor spectral and\nnuclear norms, all of which are NP-hard problems.\nIn this work we adapt the previously developed framework of tensor\namplification, which provides good approximations of the spectral and nuclear\ntensor norms, to denoising synthetic tensors of various sizes, ranks, and noise\nlevels, along with real-world tensors derived from physiological signals. We\nalso introduce denoising methods based on two variations of rank estimates\ncalled stable $X$-rank and stable slice rank. The experimental results show\nthat in the low rank context, tensor-based amplification provides comparable\ndenoising performance in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings and superior\nperformance in noisy (i.e., low SNR) settings, while the stable $X$-rank method\nachieves superior denoising performance on the physiological signal data.",

However, like many parallel-in-time methods it\ncan fail to achieve parallel speedup when applied to non-diffusive equations\nsuch as hyperbolic systems or dispersive nonlinear wave equations. This paper\nexplores the use of exponential integrators within the Parareal iteration.\nExponential integrators are particularly interesting candidates for Parareal\nbecause of their ability to resolve fast-moving waves, even at the large\nstepsizes used by coarse propagators. This work begins with an introduction to\nexponential Parareal integrators followed by several motivating numerical\nexperiments involving the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. These experiments\nare then analyzed using linear analysis that approximates the stability and\nconvergence properties of the exponential Parareal iteration on nonlinear\nproblems.

    "abstract": "Current natural language understanding (NLU) models have been continuously\nscaling up, both in terms of model size and input context, introducing more\nhidden and input neurons. While this generally improves performance on average,\nthe extra neurons do not yield a consistent improvement for all instances. This\nis because some hidden neurons are redundant, and the noise mixed in input\nneurons tends to distract the model. Previous work mainly focuses on\nextrinsically reducing low-utility neurons by additional post- or\npre-processing, such as network pruning and context selection, to avoid this\nproblem. Beyond that, can we make the model reduce redundant parameters and\nsuppress input noise by intrinsically enhancing the utility of each neuron? If\na model can efficiently utilize neurons, no matter which neurons are ablated\n(disabled), the ablated submodel should perform no better than the original\nfull model. Based on such a comparison principle between models, we propose a\ncross-model comparative loss for a broad range of tasks. Comparative loss is\nessentially a ranking loss on top of the task-specific losses of the full and\nablated models, with the expectation that the task-specific loss of the full\nmodel is minimal. We demonstrate the universal effectiveness of comparative\nloss through extensive experiments on 14 datasets from 3 distinct NLU tasks\nbased on 4 widely used pretrained language models, and find it particularly\nsuperior for models with few parameters or long input.",

In this paper, we study a\nnovel Temporal k-Core Query (TCQ) problem: given a time interval, find all\ndistinct k-cores that exist within any subintervals from a temporal graph,\nwhich generalizes the previous historical k-core query. This problem is\nchallenging because the number of subintervals increases quadratically to the\nspan of time interval. For that, we propose a novel Temporal Core Decomposition\n(TCD) algorithm that decrementally induces temporal k-cores from the previously\ninduced ones and thus reduces \"intra-core\" redundant computation significantly.\nThen, we introduce an intuitive concept named Tightest Time Interval (TTI) for\ntemporal k-core, and design an optimization technique with theoretical\nguarantee that leverages TTI as a key to predict which subintervals will induce\nduplicated k-cores and prunes the subintervals completely in advance, thereby\neliminating \"inter-core\" redundant computation. The complexity of optimized TCD\n(OTCD) algorithm no longer depends on the span of query time interval but only\nthe scale of final results, which means OTCD algorithm is scalable. Moreover,\nwe propose a compact in-memory data structure named Temporal Edge List (TEL) to\nimplement OTCD algorithm efficiently in physical level with bounded memory\nrequirement. TEL organizes temporal edges in a \"timeline\" and can be updated\ninstantly when new edges arrive, and thus our approach can also deal with\ndynamic temporal graphs.

    "abstract": "Falls are one of the leading causes of death in the elderly people aged 65\nand above. In order to prevent death by sending prompt fall detection alarms,\nnon-invasive radio-frequency (RF) based fall detection has attracted\nsignificant attention, due to its wide coverage and privacy preserving nature.\nExisting RF-based fall detection systems process fall as an activity\nclassification problem and assume that human falls introduce reproducible\npatterns to the RF signals. We, however, argue that the fall is essentially an\naccident, hence, its impact is uncontrollable and unforeseeable. We propose to\nsolve the fall detection problem in a fundamentally different manner. Instead\nof directly identifying the human falls which are difficult to quantify, we\nrecognize the normal repeatable human activities and then identify the fall as\nabnormal activities out of the normal activity distribution. We implement our\nidea and build a prototype based on commercial Wi-Fi. We conduct extensive\nexperiments with 16 human subjects. The experiment results show that our system\ncan achieve high fall detection accuracy and adapt to different environments\nfor real-time fall detection.",

    "abstract": "Keeping up with the research literature plays an important role in the\nworkflow of scientists - allowing them to understand a field, formulate the\nproblems they focus on, and develop the solutions that they contribute, which\nin turn shape the nature of the discipline. In this paper, we examine the\nliterature review practices of data scientists. Data science represents a field\nseeing an exponential rise in papers, and increasingly drawing on and being\napplied in numerous diverse disciplines. Recent efforts have seen the\ndevelopment of several tools intended to help data scientists cope with a\ndeluge of research and coordinated efforts to develop AI tools intended to\nuncover the research frontier. Despite these trends indicative of the\ninformation overload faced by data scientists, no prior work has examined the\nspecific practices and challenges faced by these scientists in an\ninterdisciplinary field with evolving scholarly norms. In this paper, we close\nthis gap through a set of semi-structured interviews and think-aloud protocols\nof industry and academic data scientists (N = 20). Our results while\ncorroborating other knowledge workers' practices uncover several novel\nfindings: individuals (1) are challenged in seeking and sensemaking of papers\nbeyond their disciplinary bubbles, (2) struggle to understand papers in the\nface of missing details and mathematical content, (3) grapple with the deluge\nby leveraging the knowledge context in code, blogs, and talks, and (4) lean on\ntheir peers online and in-person. Furthermore, we outline future directions\nlikely to help data scientists cope with the burgeoning research literature.",

    "abstract": "Renewable energy productions and electrification of mobility are promising\nsolutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Their effective integration in a\npower grid encounters several challenges. The uncertain nature of renewable\nenergy productions as well as stochastic consumptions of electric vehicles\nintroduce remarkable intermittency to a distribution grid and results in\nbi-uncertain characteristics of both supply and demand sides. One way to verify\nthe secure grid operation within acceptable voltage and loading levels is to\nassess its required flexibility considering possible boundaries of uncertain\nvariables. In this paper, first a comprehensive linear model of distribution\ngrid considering all pertaining constraints is presented. Then, a flexibility\nestimation technique is proposed based on the feasibility study of the\nuncertain space of photovoltaic power productions and load containing electric\nvehicles. The proposed methodology uses grid monitoring data to determine grid\nstate and to model uncertain parameters.

    "abstract": "Session-based Recommendation (SBR) is to predict users' next interested items\nbased on their previous browsing sessions. Existing methods model sessions as\ngraphs or sequences to estimate user interests based on their interacted items\nto make recommendations. In recent years, graph-based methods have achieved\noutstanding performance on SBR. However, none of these methods consider\ntemporal information, which is a crucial feature in SBR as it indicates\ntimeliness or currency. Besides, the session graphs exhibit a hierarchical\nstructure and are demonstrated to be suitable in hyperbolic geometry. But few\npapers design the models in hyperbolic spaces and this direction is still under\nexploration. In this paper, we propose Time-aware Hyperbolic Graph Attention\nNetwork (TA-HGAT) - a novel hyperbolic graph neural network framework to build\na session-based recommendation model considering temporal information. More\nspecifically, there are three components in TA-HGAT. First, a hyperbolic\nprojection module transforms the item features into hyperbolic space. Second,\nthe time-aware graph attention module models time intervals between items and\nthe users' current interests. Third, an evolutionary loss at the end of the\nmodel provides an accurate prediction of the recommended item based on the\ngiven timestamp. TA-HGAT is built in a hyperbolic space to learn the\nhierarchical structure of session graphs. Experimental results show that the\nproposed TA-HGAT has the best performance compared to ten baseline models on\ntwo real-world datasets.",

    "abstract": "Talking head synthesis is a promising approach for the video production\nindustry. Recently, a lot of effort has been devoted in this research area to\nimprove the generation quality or enhance the model generalization. However,\nthere are few works able to address both issues simultaneously, which is\nessential for practical applications. To this end, in this paper, we turn\nattention to the emerging powerful Latent Diffusion Models, and model the\nTalking head generation as an audio-driven temporally coherent denoising\nprocess (DiffTalk). More specifically, instead of employing audio signals as\nthe single driving factor, we investigate the control mechanism of the talking\nface, and incorporate reference face images and landmarks as conditions for\npersonality-aware generalized synthesis. In this way, the proposed DiffTalk is\ncapable of producing high-quality talking head videos in synchronization with\nthe source audio, and more importantly, it can be naturally generalized across\ndifferent identities without any further fine-tuning. Additionally, our\nDiffTalk can be gracefully tailored for higher-resolution synthesis with\nnegligible extra computational cost. Extensive experiments show that the\nproposed DiffTalk efficiently synthesizes high-fidelity audio-driven talking\nhead videos for generalized novel identities.

However, SDN-based security enforcement\nmechanisms rely heavily on the security policies containing the underlying\ninformation of data plane. With increasing the scale of underlying network, the\ncurrent security policy management mechanism will confront more and more\nchallenges. The security policy transformation for SDN networks is to research\nhow to transform the high-level security policy without containing the\nunderlying information of data plane into the practical flow entries used by\nthe OpenFlow switches automatically, thereby implementing the automation of\nsecurity policy management. Based on this insight, a practical runtime security\npolicy transformation framework is proposed in this paper. First of all, we\nspecify the security policies used by SDN networks as a system model of\nsecurity policy (SPM). From the theoretical level, we establish the system\nmodel for SDN network and propose a formal method to transform SPM into the\nsystem model of flow entries automatically. From the practical level, we\npropose a runtime security policy transformation framework to solve the problem\nof how to find a connected path for each relationship of SPM in the data plane,\nas well as how to generate the practical flow entries according to the system\nmodel of flow entries.

    "abstract": "In last-mile delivery, drivers frequently deviate from planned delivery\nroutes because of their tacit knowledge of the road and curbside\ninfrastructure, customer availability, and other characteristics of the\nrespective service areas. Hence, the actual stop sequences chosen by an\nexperienced human driver may be potentially preferable to the theoretical\nshortest-distance routing under real-life operational conditions. Thus, being\nable to predict the actual stop sequence that a human driver would follow can\nhelp to improve route planning in last-mile delivery. This paper proposes a\npair-wise attention-based pointer neural network for this prediction task using\ndrivers' historical delivery trajectory data. In addition to the commonly used\nencoder-decoder architecture for sequence-to-sequence prediction, we propose a\nnew attention mechanism based on an alternative specific neural network to\ncapture the local pair-wise information for each pair of stops. To further\ncapture the global efficiency of the route, we propose a new iterative sequence\ngeneration algorithm that is used after model training to identify the first\nstop of a route that yields the lowest operational cost. Results from an\nextensive case study on real operational data from Amazon's last-mile delivery\noperations in the US show that our proposed method can significantly outperform\ntraditional optimization-based approaches and other machine learning methods\n(such as the Long Short-Term Memory encoder-decoder and the original pointer\nnetwork) in finding stop sequences that are closer to high-quality routes\nexecuted by experienced drivers in the field. Compared to benchmark models, the\nproposed model can increase the average prediction accuracy of the first four\nstops from around 0.2 to 0.312, and reduce the disparity between the predicted\nroute and the actual route by around 15%.",

Our system aims at minimizing the total energy consumption of the\nbattery-constrained UAV by jointly optimizing the bit allocation of\ncommunication and computation along with the UAV path planning under latency,\nenergy budget and operational constraints. For availability and practicality,\nthe proposed methods were developed for three different cases according to the\naccessibility of the LEO satellite, ``Always On,\" ``Always Off\" and\n``Intermediate Disconnected\", by leveraging successive convex approximation\n(SCA) strategies. Via numerical results, we verify that significant energy\nsavings can be accrued for all cases of LEO accessibility by means of joint\noptimization of bit allocation and UAV path planning compared to partial\noptimization schemes that design for only the bit allocation or trajectory of\nthe UAV.",

    "abstract": "While speech recognition Word Error Rate (WER) has reached human parity for\nEnglish, continuous speech recognition scenarios such as voice typing and\nmeeting transcriptions still suffer from segmentation and punctuation problems,\nresulting from irregular pausing patterns or slow speakers. Transformer\nsequence tagging models are effective at capturing long bi-directional context,\nwhich is crucial for automatic punctuation. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)\nproduction systems, however, are constrained by real-time requirements, making\nit hard to incorporate the right context when making punctuation decisions.\nContext within the segments produced by ASR decoders can be helpful but\nlimiting in overall punctuation performance for a continuous speech session. In\nthis paper, we propose a streaming approach for punctuation or re-punctuation\nof ASR output using dynamic decoding windows and measure its impact on\npunctuation and segmentation accuracy across scenarios. The new system tackles\nover-segmentation issues, improving segmentation F0.5-score by 13.9%. Streaming\npunctuation achieves an average BLEUscore improvement of 0.66 for the\ndownstream task of Machine Translation (MT).",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in domain adaptation reveal that adversarial learning on deep\nneural networks can learn domain invariant features to reduce the shift between\nsource and target domains. While such adversarial approaches achieve\ndomain-level alignment, they ignore the class (label) shift.

While the adversarial\ncomponent facilitates domain-level alignment, two-stage contrastive learning\nexploits class information to achieve higher intra-class compactness across\ndomains resulting in well-separated decision boundaries. Furthermore, the\nproposed contrastive framework is designed as a plug-and-play module that can\nbe easily embedded with existing adversarial methods for domain adaptation.

    "title": "Video Semantic Segmentation with Inter-Frame Feature Fusion and  Inner-Frame Feature Refinement",
    "abstract": "Video semantic segmentation aims to generate accurate semantic maps for each\nvideo frame. To this end, many works dedicate to integrate diverse information\nfrom consecutive frames to enhance the features for prediction, where a feature\nalignment procedure via estimated optical flow is usually required. However,\nthe optical flow would inevitably suffer from inaccuracy, and then introduce\nnoises in feature fusion and further result in unsatisfactory segmentation\nresults. In this paper, to tackle the misalignment issue, we propose a\nspatial-temporal fusion (STF) module to model dense pairwise relationships\namong multi-frame features. Different from previous methods, STF uniformly and\nadaptively fuses features at different spatial and temporal positions, and\navoids error-prone optical flow estimation. Besides, we further exploit feature\nrefinement within a single frame and propose a novel memory-augmented\nrefinement (MAR) module to tackle difficult predictions among semantic\nboundaries. Specifically, MAR can store the boundary features and prototypes\nextracted from the training samples, which together form the task-specific\nmemory, and then use them to refine the features during inference. Essentially,\nMAR can move the hard features closer to the most likely category and thus make\nthem more discriminative. We conduct extensive experiments on Cityscapes and\nCamVid, and the results show that our proposed methods significantly outperform\nprevious methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks do not discriminate between spurious and causal\npatterns, and will only learn the most predictive ones while ignoring the\nothers. This shortcut learning behaviour is detrimental to a network's ability\nto generalize to an unknown test-time distribution in which the spurious\ncorrelations do not hold anymore. Debiasing methods were developed to make\nnetworks robust to such spurious biases but require to know in advance if a\ndataset is biased and make heavy use of minority counterexamples that do not\ndisplay the majority bias of their class. In this paper, we argue that such\nsamples should not be necessarily needed because the ''hidden'' causal\ninformation is often also contained in biased images. To study this idea, we\npropose 3 publicly released synthetic classification benchmarks, exhibiting\npredictive classification shortcuts, each of a different and challenging\nnature, without any minority samples acting as counterexamples. First, we\ninvestigate the effectiveness of several state-of-the-art strategies on our\nbenchmarks and show that they do not yield satisfying results on them. Then, we\npropose an architecture able to succeed on our benchmarks, despite their\nunusual properties, using an entropic adversarial data augmentation training\nscheme. An encoder-decoder architecture is tasked to produce images that are\nnot recognized by a classifier, by maximizing the conditional entropy of its\noutputs, and keep as much as possible of the initial content. A precise control\nof the information destroyed, via a disentangling process, enables us to remove\nthe shortcut and leave everything else intact. Furthermore, results competitive\nwith the state-of-the-art on the BAR dataset ensure the applicability of our\nmethod in real-life situations.",

Along this line, researchers have considered fair versions of\ntraditional optimization problems including clustering, regression, ranking and\nvoting. However, most of the efforts have been channeled into designing\nheuristic algorithms, which often do not provide any guarantees on the quality\nof the solution. In this work, we study matching problems with the notion of\nproportional fairness. Proportional fairness is one of the most popular notions\nof group fairness where every group is represented up to an extent proportional\nto the final selection size. Matching with proportional fairness or more\ncommonly, proportionally fair matching, was introduced in [Chierichetti et al.,\nAISTATS, 2019], where the problem was studied with only two groups. However, in\nmany practical applications, the number of groups -- although often a small\nconstant -- is larger than two. In this work, we make the first step towards\nunderstanding the computational complexity of proportionally fair matching with\nmore than two groups. We design exact and approximation algorithms achieving\nreasonable guarantees on the quality of the matching as well as on the time\ncomplexity.

Despite recent progress, there is still\nroom for improvement since test execution failures caused by technical\nlimitations result in unnecessary maintenance costs that limit its\neffectiveness and efficiency. One of the most reported technical challenges for\nweb-based tests concerns how to reliably locate a web element used by a test\nscript. This paper proposes the novel concept of Visually Overlapping Nodes\n(VON) that reduces fragility by utilizing the phenomenon that visual web\nelements (observed by the user) are constructed from multiple web-elements in\nthe Document Object Model (DOM) that overlaps visually. We demonstrate the\napproach in a tool, VON Similo, which extends the state-of-the-art\nmulti-locator approach (Similo) that is also used as the baseline for an\nexperiment. In the experiment, a ground truth set of 1163 manually collected\nweb element pairs, from different releases of the 40 most popular websites on\nthe internet, are used to compare the approaches' precision, recall, and\naccuracy. Our results show that VON Similo provides 94.7% accuracy in\nidentifying a web element in a new release of the same SUT. In comparison,\nSimilo provides 83.8% accuracy.

    "abstract": "Music recommender systems are an integral part of our daily life. Recent\nresearch has seen a significant effort around black-box recommender based\napproaches such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These advances have led,\ntogether with the increasing concerns around users' data collection and\nprivacy, to a strong interest in building responsible recommender systems. A\nkey element of a successful music recommender system is modelling how users\ninteract with streamed content. By first understanding these interactions,\ninsights can be drawn to enable the construction of more transparent and\nresponsible systems. An example of these interactions is skipping behaviour, a\nsignal that can measure users' satisfaction, dissatisfaction, or lack of\ninterest. In this paper, we study the utility of users' historical data for the\ntask of sequentially predicting users' skipping behaviour. To this end, we\nadapt DRL for this classification task, followed by a post-hoc explainability\n(SHAP) and ablation analysis of the input state representation. Experimental\nresults from a real-world music streaming dataset (Spotify) demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach in this task by outperforming state-of-the-art\nmodels. A comprehensive analysis of our approach and of users' historical data\nreveals a temporal data leakage problem in the dataset. Our findings indicate\nthat, overall, users' behaviour features are the most discriminative in how our\nproposed DRL model predicts music skips. Content and contextual features have a\nlesser effect. This suggests that a limited amount of user data should be\ncollected and leveraged to predict skipping behaviour.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose actor-director-critic, a new framework for deep\nreinforcement learning. Compared with the actor-critic framework, the director\nrole is added, and action classification and action evaluation are applied\nsimultaneously to improve the decision-making performance of the agent.\nFirstly, the actions of the agent are divided into high quality actions and low\nquality actions according to the rewards returned from the environment. Then,\nthe director network is trained to have the ability to discriminate high and\nlow quality actions and guide the actor network to reduce the repetitive\nexploration of low quality actions in the early stage of training. In addition,\nwe propose an improved double estimator method to better solve the problem of\noverestimation in the field of reinforcement learning. For the two critic\nnetworks used, we design two target critic networks for each critic network\ninstead of one. In this way, the target value of each critic network can be\ncalculated by taking the average of the outputs of the two target critic\nnetworks, which is more stable and accurate than using only one target critic\nnetwork to obtain the target value. In order to verify the performance of the\nactor-director-critic framework and the improved double estimator method, we\napplied them to the TD3 algorithm to improve the TD3 algorithm. Then, we\ncarried out experiments in multiple environments in MuJoCo and compared the\nexperimental data before and after the algorithm improvement. The final\nexperimental results show that the improved algorithm can achieve faster\nconvergence speed and higher total return.",

The communication and computational resources on satellites\nare usually restricted and the satellite-GU link determination affects the\ncommunication performance significantly when multiple satellites provide\nservices for multiple GUs in a collaborative manner. Therefore, considering the\nlimitation of the on-board radio-frequency chains, we first propose a hybrid\nbeamforming method consisting of analog beamforming for beam alignment and\ndigital beamforming for interference mitigation. Then, to establish appropriate\nconnections between satellites and GUs, we propose a heuristic user scheduling\nalgorithm which determines the connections according to the total spectral\nefficiency (SE) increment of the multi-satellite cooperative network. Next, a\njoint hybrid beamforming and user scheduling scheme is proposed to dramatically\nimprove the performance of the multi-satellite cooperative network. Moreover,\nsimulations are conducted to compare the proposed schemes with representative\nbaselines and analyze the key factors influencing the performance of the\nmulti-satellite cooperative network.

    "abstract": "Many contemporary applications feature multi-megabyte instruction footprints\nthat overwhelm the capacity of branch target buffers (BTB) and instruction\ncaches (L1-I), causing frequent front-end stalls that inevitably hurt\nperformance. BTB capacity is crucial for performance as a sufficiently large\nBTB enables the front-end to accurately resolve the upcoming execution path and\nsteer instruction fetch appropriately. Moreover, it also enables highly\neffective fetch-directed instruction prefetching that can eliminate a large\nportion L1-I misses. For these reasons, commercial processors allocate vast\namounts of storage capacity to BTBs.\nThis work aims to reduce BTB storage requirements by optimizing the\norganization of BTB entries. Our key insight is that storing branch target\noffsets, instead of full or compressed targets, can drastically reduce BTB\nstorage cost as the vast majority of dynamic branches have short offsets\nrequiring just a handful of bits to encode. Based on this insight, we size the\nways of a set associative BTB to hold different number of target offset bits\nsuch that each way stores offsets within a particular range. Doing so enables a\ndramatic reduction in storage for target addresses. Our final design, called\nBTB-X, uses an 8-way set associative BTB with differently sized ways that\nenables it to track about 2.24x more branches than a conventional BTB and 1.3x\nmore branches than a storage-optimized state-of-the-art BTB organization,\ncalled PDede, with the same storage budget.",

One typical advantage of DT is that\nit can be used to not only virtually replicate a system's detailed operations\nbut also analyze the current condition, predict the future behavior, and refine\nthe control optimization. Although DT has been widely implemented in various\nfields, such as smart manufacturing and transportation, its conventional\nparadigm is limited to embody non-living entities, e.g., robots and vehicles.\nWhen adopted in human-centric systems, a novel concept, called human digital\ntwin (HDT) has thus been proposed. Particularly, HDT allows \\emph{in silico}\nrepresentation of individual human body with the ability to dynamically reflect\nmolecular status, physiological status, emotional and psychological status, as\nwell as lifestyle evolutions. These prompt the expected application of HDT in\npersonalized healthcare, which can facilitate the remote monitoring, diagnosis,\nprescription, surgery and rehabilitation, and hence significantly alleviate the\nheavy burden on the traditional healthcare system. However, despite the large\npotential, HDT faces substantial research challenges in different aspects, and\nbecomes an increasingly popular topic recently. In this survey, with a specific\nfocus on the networking perspective, we first discuss the differences between\nHDT and the conventional DT, followed by the architecture and design\nrequirements of HDT. We then review and analyze end-to-end networking\ntechnologies for enabling HDT, including data acquisition, communication,\ncomputation, data management, data analysis and decision making.

    "abstract": "The mitigation of distribution network (DN) unbalance and the use of\nsingle-phase flexibility for congestion mitigation requires accurate phase\nconnection information, which is often not available. For a large DN, the naive\nphase identification proposed in the majority of the prior works using a single\nvoltage reference does not scale well for a multi-feeder DN. We present a\nconsensus algorithm-based phase identification mechanism which uses multiple\nthree-phase reference points to improve the prediction of phases. Due to the\nabsence of real measurements for a real-suburban German DN, the algorithms are\ndeveloped and evaluated over synthetic data using a digital twin. To utilize\nstrongly correlated measurements, the DN is clustered into zones. We observe\nthose reference measurements located in the same zone as the single-phase\nconsumer leads to accurate prediction of DN phases. Four consensus algorithms\nare developed and compared. Using numerical results, we recommend the most\nrobust phase identification mechanism. In our evaluation, measurement error,\nand the impact of the neutral conductor are also assessed. We assume limited DN\nobservability and apply our findings to a German DN without smart meters, but\nonly less than 8% of nodes have measurement boxes along with single-phase\nconsumers with a home energy management system.

    "abstract": "Simulation is essential to validate autonomous driving systems. However, a\nsimple simulation, even for an extremely high number of simulated miles or\nhours, is not sufficient. We need well-founded criteria showing that simulation\ndoes indeed cover a large fraction of the relevant real-world situations. In\naddition, the validation must concern not only incidents, but also the\ndetection of any type of potentially dangerous situation, such as traffic\nviolations.\nWe investigate a rigorous simulation and testing-based validation method for\nautonomous driving systems that integrates an existing industrial simulator and\na formally defined testing environment. The environment includes a scenario\ngenerator that drives the simulation process and a monitor that checks at\nruntime the observed behavior of the system against a set of system properties\nto be validated. The validation method consists in extracting from the\nsimulator a semantic model of the simulated system including a metric graph,\nwhich is a mathematical model of the environment in which the vehicles of the\nsystem evolve. The monitor can verify properties formalized in a first-order\nlinear temporal logic and provide diagnostics explaining their non\nsatisfaction. Instead of exploring the system behavior randomly as many\nsimulators do, we propose a method to systematically generate sets of scenarios\nthat cover potentially risky situations, especially for different types of\njunctions where specific traffic rules must be respected. We show that the\nsystematic exploration of risky situations has uncovered many flaws in the real\nsimulator that would have been very difficult to discover by a random\nexploration process.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain smart contracts have given rise to a variety of interesting and\ncompelling applications and emerged as a revolutionary force for the Internet.\nQuite a few practitioners have devoted themselves to developing tools for\ndetecting bugs in smart contracts. One line of efforts revolve around static\nanalysis techniques, which heavily suffer from high false-positive rates.\nAnother line of works concentrate on fuzzing techniques. Unfortunately, current\nfuzzing approaches for smart contracts tend to conduct fuzzing starting from\nthe initial state of the contract, which expends too much energy revolving\naround the initial state and thus is usually unable to unearth bugs triggered\nby other states. Moreover, most existing methods treat each branch equally,\nfailing to take care of the branches that are rare or more likely to possess\nbugs. This might lead to resources wasted on normal branches. In this paper, we\ntry to tackle these challenges from three aspects: (1) In generating function\ninvocation sequences, we explicitly consider data dependencies between\nfunctions to facilitate exploring richer states. We further prolong a function\ninvocation sequence S1 by appending a new sequence S2, so that S2 can start\nfuzzing from states that are different from the initial state. (2) We\nincorporate a branch distance-based measure to evolve test cases iteratively\ntowards a target branch. (3) We engage a branch search algorithm to discover\nrare and vulnerable branches, and design an energy allocation mechanism to take\ncare of exercising these crucial branches. We implement IR-Fuzz and extensively\nevaluate it over 12K real-world contracts. Empirical results show that: (i)\nIR-Fuzz achieves 28% higher branch coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzing\napproaches, and (ii) IR-Fuzz detects more vulnerabilities and increases the\naverage accuracy of vulnerability detection by 7% over current methods.",

These databases record the libraries related to each\nvulnerability. However, the vulnerability reports may not explicitly list every\nlibrary and human analysis is required to determine all the relevant libraries.\nHuman analysis may be slow and expensive, which motivates the need for\nautomated approaches. Researchers and practitioners have proposed to\nautomatically identify libraries from vulnerability reports using extreme\nmulti-label learning (XML).\nWhile state-of-the-art XML techniques showed promising performance, their\nexperiment settings do not practically fit what happens in reality. Previous\nstudies randomly split the vulnerability reports data for training and testing\ntheir models without considering the chronological order of the reports. This\nmay unduly train the models on chronologically newer reports while testing the\nmodels on chronologically older ones. However, in practice, one often receives\nchronologically new reports, which may be related to previously unseen\nlibraries. Under this practical setting, we observe that the performance of\ncurrent XML techniques declines substantially, e.g., F1 decreased from 0.7 to\n0.24 under experiments without and with consideration of chronological order of\nvulnerability reports.\nWe propose a practical library identification approach, namely CHRONOS, based\non zero-shot learning. The novelty of CHRONOS is three-fold. First, CHRONOS\nfits into the practical pipeline by considering the chronological order of\nvulnerability reports. Second, CHRONOS enriches the data of the vulnerability\ndescriptions and labels using a carefully designed data enhancement step.\nThird, CHRONOS exploits the temporal ordering of the vulnerability reports\nusing a cache to prioritize prediction of...",

However, selective harvesting of strawberries is complicated forming\na few scientific research questions. Most available solutions only deal with a\nspecific picking scenario, e.g., picking only a single variety of fruit in\nisolation. Nonetheless, most economically viable (e.g. high-yielding and/or\ndisease-resistant) varieties of strawberry are grown in dense clusters. The\ncurrent perception technology in such use cases is inefficient. In this work,\nwe developed a novel system capable of harvesting strawberries with several\nunique features. The features allow the system to deal with very complex\npicking scenarios, e.g. dense clusters. Our concept of a modular system makes\nour system reconfigurable to adapt to different picking scenarios. We designed,\nmanufactured, and tested a picking head with 2.5 DOF (2 independent mechanisms\nand 1 dependent cutting system) capable of removing possible occlusions and\nharvesting targeted strawberries without contacting fruit flesh to avoid damage\nand bruising. In addition, we developed a novel perception system to localise\nstrawberries and detect their key points, picking points, and determine their\nripeness. For this purpose, we introduced two new datasets. Finally, we tested\nthe system in a commercial strawberry growing field and our research farm with\nthree different strawberry varieties. The results show the effectiveness and\nreliability of the proposed system. The designed picking head was able to\nremove occlusions and harvest strawberries effectively. The perception system\nwas able to detect and determine the ripeness of strawberries with 95%\naccuracy. In total, the system was able to harvest 87% of all detected\nstrawberries with a success rate of 83% for all pluckable fruits.

    "abstract": "Training machines to understand natural language and interact with humans is\none of the major goals of artificial intelligence. Recent years have witnessed\nan evolution from matching networks to pre-trained language models (PrLMs). In\ncontrast to the plain-text modeling as the focus of the PrLMs, dialogue texts\ninvolve multiple speakers and reflect special characteristics such as topic\ntransitions and structure dependencies between distant utterances. However, the\nrelated PrLM models commonly represent dialogues sequentially by processing the\npairwise dialogue history as a whole. Thus the hierarchical information on\neither utterance interrelation or speaker roles coupled in such representations\nis not well addressed. In this work, we propose compositional learning for\nholistic interaction across the utterances beyond the sequential\ncontextualization from PrLMs, in order to capture the utterance-aware and\nspeaker-aware representations entailed in a dialogue history. We decouple the\ncontextualized word representations by masking mechanisms in Transformer-based\nPrLM, making each word only focus on the words in current utterance, other\nutterances, and two speaker roles (i.e., utterances of sender and utterances of\nthe receiver), respectively. In addition, we employ domain-adaptive training\nstrategies to help the model adapt to the dialogue domains. Experimental\nresults show that our method substantially boosts the strong PrLM baselines in\nfour public benchmark datasets, achieving new state-of-the-art performance over\nprevious methods.",

In this paper, we focus on a special kind of dynamic update, the\nexpansion of vertices into arbitrary biconnected graphs, while maintaining the\nSPQR-tree and further information. This will also allow us to efficiently merge\ntwo SPQR-trees by identifying the edges incident to two vertices with each\nother. We do this working along an axiomatic definition lifting the SPQR-tree\nto a stand-alone data structure that can be modified independently from the\ngraph it might have been derived from.

To overcome this problem, in this work, we\npropose a mutual learning framework based on pseudo-negative labels. Negative\nlabels are those that a corresponding data item does not belong. In each\niteration, one submodel generates pseudo-negative labels for each data item,\nand the other submodel learns from these labels. The role of the two submodels\nexchanges after each iteration until convergence. By reducing the prediction\nprobability on pseudo-negative labels, the dual model can improve its\nprediction ability. We also propose a mechanism to select a few pseudo-negative\nlabels to feed into submodels. In the experiments, our framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on several main benchmarks. Specifically, with our\nframework, the error rates of the 13-layer CNN model are 9.35% and 7.94% for\nCIFAR-10 with 1000 and 4000 labels, respectively. In addition, for the\nnon-augmented MNIST with only 20 labels, the error rate is 0.81% by our\nframework, which is much smaller than that of other approaches. Our approach\nalso demonstrates a significant performance improvement in domain adaptation.",

    "title": "Language Models sounds the Death Knell of Knowledge Graphs",
    "abstract": "Healthcare domain generates a lot of unstructured and semi-structured text.\nNatural Language processing (NLP) has been used extensively to process this\ndata. Deep Learning based NLP especially Large Language Models (LLMs) such as\nBERT have found broad acceptance and are used extensively for many\napplications. A Language Model is a probability distribution over a word\nsequence. Self-supervised Learning on a large corpus of data automatically\ngenerates deep learning-based language models. BioBERT and Med-BERT are\nlanguage models pre-trained for the healthcare domain. Healthcare uses typical\nNLP tasks such as question answering, information extraction, named entity\nrecognition, and search to simplify and improve processes. However, to ensure\nrobust application of the results, NLP practitioners need to normalize and\nstandardize them. One of the main ways of achieving normalization and\nstandardization is the use of Knowledge Graphs. A Knowledge Graph captures\nconcepts and their relationships for a specific domain, but their creation is\ntime-consuming and requires manual intervention from domain experts, which can\nprove expensive. SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical\nTerms), Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and Gene Ontology (GO) are\npopular ontologies from the healthcare domain. SNOMED CT and UMLS capture\nconcepts such as disease, symptoms and diagnosis and GO is the world's largest\nsource of information on the functions of genes. Healthcare has been dealing\nwith an explosion in information about different types of drugs, diseases, and\nprocedures. This paper argues that using Knowledge Graphs is not the best\nsolution for solving problems in this domain. We present experiments using LLMs\nfor the healthcare domain to demonstrate that language models provide the same\nfunctionality as knowledge graphs, thereby making knowledge graphs redundant.",

These challenges of container-based HPC application development\nclosely align with the several advantages that a new universal intermediate\nbinary format called WebAssembly (Wasm) has to offer. These include a\nlightweight userspace isolation mechanism and portability across operating\nsystems and processor architectures. In this paper, we explore the usage of\nWasm as a distribution format for MPI-based HPC applications. To this end, we\npresent MPIWasm, a novel Wasm embedder for MPI-based HPC applications that\nenables high-performance execution of Wasm code, has low-overhead for MPI\ncalls, and supports high-performance networking interconnects present on HPC\nsystems. We evaluate the performance and overhead of MPIWasm on a production\nHPC system and AWS Graviton2 nodes using standardized HPC benchmarks.

The data needed for the counting\nis however often personal and sensitive, and need to be processed using\nprivacy-preserving techniques. The quality of data in different databases, for\nexample typos, errors and variations, poses additional challenges for accurate\ncardinality estimation. While privacy-preserving cardinality counting has\ngained much attention in the recent times and a few privacy-preserving\nalgorithms have been developed for cardinality estimation, no work has so far\nbeen done on privacy-preserving cardinality counting using record linkage\ntechniques with fuzzy matching and provable privacy guarantees.

However, inducing desired movements using FES is still\nan open engineering problem. This problem is accentuated by the complexities of\nhuman arms' neuromechanics and the variations across individuals. Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) emerges as a promising approach to govern customised control\nrules for different settings. Yet, one remaining challenge of controlling FES\nsystems for RL is unobservable muscle fatigue that progressively changes as an\nunknown function of the stimulation, thereby breaking the Markovian assumption\nof RL. In this work, we present a method to address the unobservable muscle\nfatigue issue, allowing our RL controller to achieve higher control\nperformances. Our method is based on a Gaussian State-Space Model (GSSM) that\nutilizes recurrent neural networks to learn Markovian state-spaces from partial\nobservations. The GSSM is used as a filter that converts the observations into\nthe state-space representation for RL to preserve the Markovian assumption.\nHere, we start with presenting the modification of the original GSSM to address\nan overconfident issue. We then present the interaction between RL and the\nmodified GSSM, followed by the setup for FES control learning.

    "abstract": "Prototypical part network (ProtoPNet) methods have been designed to achieve\ninterpretable classification by associating predictions with a set of training\nprototypes, which we refer to as trivial (i.e., easy-to-learn) prototypes\nbecause they are trained to lie far from the classification boundary in the\nfeature space. Note that it is possible to make an analogy between ProtoPNet\nand support vector machine (SVM) given that the classification from both\nmethods relies on computing similarity with a set of training points (i.e.,\ntrivial prototypes in ProtoPNet, and support vectors in SVM). However, while\ntrivial prototypes are located far from the classification boundary, support\nvectors are located close to this boundary, and we argue that this discrepancy\nwith the well-established SVM theory can result in ProtoPNet models with\nsuboptimal classification accuracy. In this paper, we aim to improve the\nclassification accuracy of ProtoPNet with a new method to learn support\nprototypes that lie near the classification boundary in the feature space, as\nsuggested by the SVM theory. In addition, we target the improvement of\nclassification interpretability with a new model, named ST-ProtoPNet, which\nexploits our support prototypes and the trivial prototypes to provide\ncomplementary interpretability information. Experimental results on\nCUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, and Stanford Dogs datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed method achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy and produces\nmore visually meaningful and diverse prototypes.",

We assess the realistic (i.e., worst-case) privacy\nguarantees that are provided to users who are unable to trust the server. To\nthis end, we propose an attack against FL protected with distributed\ndifferential privacy (DDP) and secure aggregation (SA). The attack method is\nbased on the introduction of Sybil devices that deviate from the protocol to\nexpose individual users' data for reconstruction by the server. The underlying\nroot cause for the vulnerability to our attack is the power imbalance. The\nserver orchestrates the whole protocol and users are given little guarantees\nabout the selection of other users participating in the protocol.

    "abstract": "Human-Object Interaction (HOI), as an important problem in computer vision,\nrequires locating the human-object pair and identifying the interactive\nrelationships between them. The HOI instance has a greater span in spatial,\nscale, and task than the individual object instance, making its detection more\nsusceptible to noisy backgrounds. To alleviate the disturbance of noisy\nbackgrounds on HOI detection, it is necessary to consider the input image\ninformation to generate fine-grained anchors which are then leveraged to guide\nthe detection of HOI instances. However, it is challenging for the following\nreasons. i) how to extract pivotal features from the images with complex\nbackground information is still an open question. ii) how to semantically align\nthe extracted features and query embeddings is also a difficult issue. In this\npaper, a novel end-to-end transformer-based framework (FGAHOI) is proposed to\nalleviate the above problems. FGAHOI comprises three dedicated components\nnamely, multi-scale sampling (MSS), hierarchical spatial-aware merging (HSAM)\nand task-aware merging mechanism (TAM). MSS extracts features of humans,\nobjects and interaction areas from noisy backgrounds for HOI instances of\nvarious scales. HSAM and TAM semantically align and merge the extracted\nfeatures and query embeddings in the hierarchical spatial and task perspectives\nin turn. In the meanwhile, a novel training strategy Stage-wise Training\nStrategy is designed to reduce the training pressure caused by overly complex\ntasks done by FGAHOI. In addition, we propose two ways to measure the\ndifficulty of HOI detection and a novel dataset, i.e., HOI-SDC for the two\nchallenges (Uneven Distributed Area in Human-Object Pairs and Long Distance\nVisual Modeling of Human-Object Pairs) of HOI instances detection.",

For decades, PBM offered\nbenefits in interpretability and physical consistency but struggled to\nefficiently leverage large datasets. ML methods, especially deep networks,\npresented strong predictive skills yet lacked the ability to answer specific\nscientific questions. While various methods have been proposed for ML-physics\nintegration, an important underlying theme -- differentiable modeling -- is not\nsufficiently recognized.

Preliminary evidence suggests DG offers better interpretability and\ncausality than ML, improved generalizability and extrapolation capability, and\nstrong potential for knowledge discovery, while approaching the performance of\npurely data-driven ML.

An alternative approach deployable in the imminent future is\n$\\textit{human-compatible control}$, where human drivers are guided by\nreal-time instructions to stabilize the traffic.

In addition, we propose a lightweight\ndetection sub-head model for classifying predicted objects and filter out false\ndetected objects that significantly improves model precision in a negligible\ntime and computing cost.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is the formal verification of a counterexample of\nSantos et al. to the so-called Hirsch Conjecture on the diameter of polytopes\n(bounded convex polyhedra). In contrast with the pen-and-paper proof, our\napproach is entirely computational: we implement in Coq and prove correct an\nalgorithm that explicitly computes, within the proof assistant, vertex-edge\ngraphs of polytopes as well as their diameter. The originality of this\ncertificate-based algorithm is to achieve a tradeoff between simplicity and\nefficiency.\nSimplicity is crucial in obtaining the proof of correctness of the algorithm.\nThis proof splits into the correctness of an abstract algorithm stated over\nproof-oriented data types and the correspondence with a low-level\nimplementation over computation-oriented data types. A special effort has been\nmade to reduce the algorithm to a small sequence of elementary operations\n(e.g., matrix multiplications, basic routines on sets and graphs), in order to\nmake the derivation of the correctness of the low-level implementation more\ntransparent.\nEfficiency allows us to scale up to polytopes with a challenging\ncombinatorics. For instance, we formally check the two counterexamples of\nMatschke, Santos and Weibel to the Hirsch conjecture, respectively 20- and\n23-dimensional polytopes with 36 425 and 73 224 vertices involving rational\ncoefficients with up to 40 digits in their numerator and denominator. We also\nillustrate the performance of the method by computing the list of vertices or\nthe diameter of well-known classes of polytopes, such as (polars of) cyclic\npolytopes involved in McMullen's Upper Bound Theorem.",

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has demonstrated excellent quality in novel view\nsynthesis, thanks to its ability to model 3D object geometries in a concise\nformulation. However, current approaches to NeRF-based models rely on clean\nimages with accurate camera calibration, which can be difficult to obtain in\nthe real world, where data is often subject to corruption and distortion. In\nthis work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the robustness of\nNeRF-based novel view synthesis algorithms in the presence of different types\nof corruptions.\nWe find that NeRF-based models are significantly degraded in the presence of\ncorruption, and are more sensitive to a different set of corruptions than image\nrecognition models. Furthermore, we analyze the robustness of the feature\nencoder in generalizable methods, which synthesize images using neural features\nextracted via convolutional neural networks or transformers, and find that it\nonly contributes marginally to robustness. Finally, we reveal that standard\ndata augmentation techniques, which can significantly improve the robustness of\nrecognition models, do not help the robustness of NeRF-based models. We hope\nthat our findings will attract more researchers to study the robustness of\nNeRF-based approaches and help to improve their performance in the real world.",

    "abstract": "Protein folding neural networks (PFNNs) such as AlphaFold predict remarkably\naccurate structures of proteins compared to other approaches. However, the\nrobustness of such networks has heretofore not been explored. This is\nparticularly relevant given the broad social implications of such technologies\nand the fact that biologically small perturbations in the protein sequence do\nnot generally lead to drastic changes in the protein structure. In this paper,\nwe demonstrate that AlphaFold does not exhibit such robustness despite its high\naccuracy. This raises the challenge of detecting and quantifying the extent to\nwhich these predicted protein structures can be trusted. To measure the\nrobustness of the predicted structures, we utilize (i) the root-mean-square\ndeviation (RMSD) and (ii) the Global Distance Test (GDT) similarity measure\nbetween the predicted structure of the original sequence and the structure of\nits adversarially perturbed version. We prove that the problem of minimally\nperturbing protein sequences to fool protein folding neural networks is\nNP-complete. Based on the well-established BLOSUM62 sequence alignment scoring\nmatrix, we generate adversarial protein sequences and show that the RMSD\nbetween the predicted protein structure and the structure of the original\nsequence are very large when the adversarial changes are bounded by (i) 20\nunits in the BLOSUM62 distance, and (ii) five residues (out of hundreds or\nthousands of residues) in the given protein sequence. In our experimental\nevaluation, we consider 111 COVID-19 proteins in the Universal Protein resource\n(UniProt), a central resource for protein data managed by the European\nBioinformatics Institute, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, and the US Protein\nInformation Resource.

    "abstract": "Conversational search has evolved as a new information retrieval paradigm,\nmarking a shift from traditional search systems towards interactive dialogues\nwith intelligent search agents. This change especially affects exploratory\ninformation-seeking contexts, where conversational search systems can guide the\ndiscovery of unfamiliar domains. In these scenarios, users find it often\ndifficult to express their information goals due to insufficient background\nknowledge. Conversational interfaces can provide assistance by eliciting\ninformation needs and narrowing down the search space. However, due to the\ncomplexity of information-seeking behavior, the design of conversational\ninterfaces for retrieving information remains a great challenge. Although prior\nwork has employed user studies to empirically ground the system design, most\nexisting studies are limited to well-defined search tasks or known domains,\nthus being less exploratory in nature. Therefore, we conducted a laboratory\nstudy to investigate open-ended search behavior for navigation through unknown\ninformation landscapes. The study comprised of 26 participants who were\nrestricted in their search to a text chat interface. Based on the collected\ndialogue transcripts, we applied statistical analyses and process mining\ntechniques to uncover general information-seeking patterns across five\ndifferent domains. We not only identify core dialogue acts and their\ninterrelations that enable users to discover domain knowledge, but also derive\ndesign suggestions for conversational search systems.",

    "abstract": "Building and maintaining large AI fleets to efficiently support the\nfast-growing DL workloads is an active research topic for modern cloud\ninfrastructure providers. Generating accurate benchmarks plays an essential\nrole in the design and evaluation of rapidly evoloving software and hardware\nsolutions in this area. Two fundamental challenges to make this process\nscalable are (i) workload representativeness and (ii) the ability to quickly\nincorporate changes to the fleet into the benchmarks.\nTo overcome these issues, we propose Mystique, an accurate and scalable\nframework for production AI benchmark generation. It leverages the PyTorch\nexecution graph (EG), a new feature that captures the runtime information of AI\nmodels at the granularity of operators, in a graph format, together with their\nmetadata. By sourcing EG traces from the fleet, we can build AI benchmarks that\nare portable and representative. Mystique is scalable, with its lightweight\ndata collection, in terms of runtime overhead and user instrumentation efforts.\nIt is also adaptive, as the expressiveness and composability of EG format\nallows flexible user control over benchmark creation.\nWe evaluate our methodology on several production AI workloads, and show that\nbenchmarks generated with Mystique closely resemble original AI models, both in\nexecution time and system-level metrics. We also showcase the portability of\nthe generated benchmarks across platforms, and demonstrate several use cases\nenabled by the fine-grained composability of the execution graph.",

In this study we investigate weighted exposure-networks of\nhuman daily activities in the capital region of Finland as a proxy for contacts\nbetween postal code areas during the pre-pandemic year 2019 and pandemic years\n2020, 2021 and early 2022. We investigate the suitability of gravity and\nradiation type models for reconstructing the exposure-networks based on\ngeo-spatial and population mobility information. For this we use a mobile phone\ndataset of aggregated daily visits from a postal code area to cellphone grid\nlocations, and treat it as a bipartite network to create weighted one mode\nprojections using a weighted co-occurrence function. We fit a gravitation model\nand a radiation model to the averaged weekly and yearly projection networks\nwith geo-spatial and socioeconomic variables of the postal code areas and their\npopulations. We also consider an extended gravity type model comprising of\nadditional postal area information such as distance via public transportation\nand population density. The results show that the co-occurrence of human\nactivities, or exposure, between postal code areas follows both the gravity and\nradiation type interactions, once fitted to the empirical network. The effects\nof the pandemic beginning in 2020 can be observed as a decrease of the overall\nactivity as well as of the exposure of the projected networks. In general, the\nresults show that the postal code level networks changed to be more proximity\nweighted after the pandemic began, following the government imposed\nnon-pharmaceutical interventions, with differences based on the geo-spatial and\nsocioeconomic structure of the areas.",

The\nexisting approaches to BAI address the following question: what is an optimal\nsampling strategy when we spend a $\\beta$ fraction of the samples on the best\narm? These approaches treat $\\beta$ as a tunable parameter and offer efficient\nalgorithms that ensure optimality up to selecting $\\beta$, hence\n$\\beta-$optimality. However, the BAI decisions and performance can be highly\nsensitive to the choice of $\\beta$. This paper provides a BAI algorithm that is\nagnostic to $\\beta$, dispensing with the need for tuning $\\beta$, and specifies\nan optimal allocation strategy, including the optimal value of $\\beta$.\nFurthermore, the existing relevant literature focuses on the family of\nexponential distributions. This paper considers a more general setting of any\narbitrary family of distributions parameterized by their mean values (under\nmild regularity conditions).",

The cutwidth of\nan ordering is the maximum cutwidth of any vertex with respect to this\nordering. We are interested in finding the cutwidth of a graph, that is, the\nminimum cutwidth over all orderings, which is an NP-hard problem. In order to\napproximate the cutwidth of a given graph, we present a semidefinite\nrelaxation. We identify several classes of valid inequalities and equalities\nthat we use to strengthen the semidefinite relaxation. These classes are on the\none hand the well-known 3-dicycle equations and the triangle inequalities and\non the other hand we obtain inequalities from the squared linear ordering\npolytope and via lifting the linear ordering polytope. The solution of the\nsemidefinite program serves to obtain a lower bound and also to construct a\nfeasible solution and thereby having an upper bound on the cutwidth.\nIn order to evaluate the quality of our bounds, we perform numerical\nexperiments on graphs of different sizes and densities. It turns out that we\nproduce high quality bounds for graphs of medium size independent of their\ndensity in reasonable time.

    "abstract": "Donald Knuth, in a draft of a coming volume of The Art of Computer\nProgramming, has recently conjectured that in Depth-First Search of a random\ndigraph with geometric outdegree distribution, the numbers of back and forward\narcs have the same distribution.\nWe show that this conjecture is equivalent to an equality between two\ngenerating functions defined by different recursions.\nUnfortunately, we have not been able so use this to prove the conjecture,\nwhich still is open, but we hope that this note will inspire others to succeed\nwith the conjecture.",
