    "title": "Fully Elman Neural Network: A Novel Deep Recurrent Neural Network  Optimized by an Improved Harris Hawks Algorithm for Classification of  Pulmonary Arterial Wedge Pressure",
    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is one of the most prevalent life-threatening\ncardiovascular diseases in which 6.5 million people are suffering in the USA\nand more than 23 million worldwide. Mechanical circulatory support of HF\npatients can be achieved by implanting a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)\ninto HF patients as a bridge to transplant, recovery or destination therapy and\ncan be controlled by measurement of normal and abnormal pulmonary arterial\nwedge pressure (PAWP). While there are no commercial long-term implantable\npressure sensors to measure PAWP, real-time non-invasive estimation of abnormal\nand normal PAWP becomes vital. In this work, first an improved Harris Hawks\noptimizer algorithm called HHO+ is presented and tested on 24 unimodal and\nmultimodal benchmark functions. Second, a novel fully Elman neural network\n(FENN) is proposed to improve the classification performance. Finally, four\nnovel 18-layer deep learning methods of convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\nwith multi-layer perceptron (CNN-MLP), CNN with Elman neural networks\n(CNN-ENN), CNN with fully Elman neural networks (CNN-FENN), and CNN with fully\nElman neural networks optimized by HHO+ algorithm (CNN-FENN-HHO+) for\nclassification of abnormal and normal PAWP using estimated HVAD pump flow were\ndeveloped and compared. The estimated pump flow was derived by a non-invasive\nmethod embedded into the commercial HVAD controller. The proposed methods are\nevaluated on an imbalanced clinical dataset using 5-fold cross-validation. The\nproposed CNN-FENN-HHO+ method outperforms the proposed CNN-MLP, CNN-ENN and\nCNN-FENN methods and improved the classification performance metrics across\n5-fold cross-validation. The proposed methods can reduce the likelihood of\nhazardous events like pulmonary congestion and ventricular suction for HF\npatients and notify identified abnormal cases to the hospital, clinician and\ncardiologist.",

Our approach is the first parameter-free\nmethod for this class without additional multiplicative log factors in the\nconvergence rate. We present extensive experiments for SGD and Adam variants of\nour method, where the method automatically matches hand-tuned learning rates\nacross more than a dozen diverse machine learning problems, including\nlarge-scale vision and language problems.

    "abstract": "Neural networks trained with gradient descent can undergo non-trivial phase\ntransitions as a function of the learning rate. In (Lewkowycz et al., 2020) it\nwas discovered that wide neural nets can exhibit a catapult phase for\nsuper-critical learning rates, where the training loss grows exponentially\nquickly at early times before rapidly decreasing to a small value. During this\nphase the top eigenvalue of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) also undergoes\nsignificant evolution. In this work, we will prove that the catapult phase\nexists in a large class of models, including quadratic models and two-layer,\nhomogenous neural nets. To do this, we show that for a certain range of\nlearning rates the weight norm decreases whenever the loss becomes large. We\nalso empirically study learning rates beyond this theoretically derived range\nand show that the activation map of ReLU nets trained with super-critical\nlearning rates becomes increasingly sparse as we increase the learning rate.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new paradigm for analysing and finding bugs in quantum\ncircuits. In our approach, the problem is given by a triple $\\{P\\}\\,C\\,\\{Q\\}$\nand the question is whether, given a set $P$ of quantum states on the input of\na circuit $C$, the set of quantum states on the output is equal to (or included\nin) a set $Q$. While this is not suitable to specify, e.g., functional\ncorrectness of a quantum circuit, it is sufficient to detect many bugs in\nquantum circuits. We propose a technique based on tree automata to compactly\nrepresent sets of quantum states and develop transformers to implement the\nsemantics of quantum gates over this representation. Our technique computes\nwith an algebraic representation of quantum states, avoiding the inaccuracy of\nworking with floating-point numbers.

    "abstract": "The carbon-capturing process with the aid of CO2 removal technology (CDRT)\nhas been recognised as an alternative and a prominent approach to deep\ndecarbonisation. However, the main hindrance is the enormous energy demand and\nthe economic implication of CDRT if not effectively managed. Hence, a novel\ndeep reinforcement learning agent (DRL), integrated with an automated\nhyperparameter selection feature, is proposed in this study for the real-time\nscheduling of a multi-energy system coupled with CDRT. Post-carbon capture\nsystems (PCCS) and direct-air capture systems (DACS) are considered CDRT.\nVarious possible configurations are evaluated using real-time multi-energy data\nof a district in Arizona and CDRT parameters from manufacturers' catalogues and\npilot project documentation. The simulation results validate that an optimised\nsoft-actor critic (SAC) algorithm outperformed the TD3 algorithm due to its\nmaximum entropy feature. We then trained four (4) SAC agents, equivalent to the\nnumber of considered case studies, using optimised hyperparameter values and\ndeployed them in real time for evaluation. The results show that the proposed\nDRL agent can meet the prosumers' multi-energy demand and schedule the CDRT\nenergy demand economically without specified constraints violation. Also, the\nproposed DRL agent outperformed rule-based scheduling by 23.65%. However, the\nconfiguration with PCCS and solid-sorbent DACS is considered the most suitable\nconfiguration with a high CO2 captured-released ratio of 38.54, low CO2\nreleased indicator value of 2.53, and a 36.5% reduction in CDR cost due to\nwaste heat utilisation and high absorption capacity of the selected sorbent.\nHowever, the adoption of CDRT is not economically viable at the current carbon\nprice. Finally, we showed that CDRT would be attractive at a carbon price of\n400-450USD/ton with the provision of tax incentives by the policymakers.",

    "abstract": "Symbolic execution is a program analysis technique commonly utilized to\ndetermine whether programs violate properties and, in case violations are\nfound, to generate inputs that can trigger them. Used in the context of\nsecurity properties such as noninterference, symbolic execution is precise when\nlooking for counterexample pairs of traces when insecure information flows are\nfound, however it is sound only up to a bound thus it does not allow to prove\nthe correctness of programs with executions beyond the given bound. By\ncontrast, abstract interpretation-based static analysis guarantees soundness\nbut generally lacks the ability to provide counterexample pairs of traces. In\nthis paper, we propose to weave both to obtain the best of two worlds. We\ndemonstrate this with a series of static analyses, including a static analysis\ncalled RedSoundRSE aimed at verifying noninterference. RedSoundRSE provides\nboth semantically sound results and the ability to derive counterexample pairs\nof traces up to a bound. It relies on a combination of symbolic execution and\nabstract domains inspired by the well known notion of reduced product. We\nformalize RedSoundRSE and prove its soundness as well as its relative precision\nup to a bound.

One\nimportant aspect of financial transaction networks is temporality. The order\nand repetition of transactions can offer new insights when considered within\nthe graph structure. Temporal motifs, defined as a set of nodes that interact\nwith each other in a short time period, are a promising tool in this context.\nIn this work, we study three unique temporal financial networks: transactions\nin Mercari, an online marketplace, payments in a synthetic network generated by\nJ.P.

For friendship prediction,\ntemporal motifs yield better results than general heuristics, such as Jaccard\nand Adamic-Adar measures.

    "title": "A Domain-Agnostic Approach for Characterization of Lifelong Learning  Systems",
    "abstract": "Despite the advancement of machine learning techniques in recent years,\nstate-of-the-art systems lack robustness to \"real world\" events, where the\ninput distributions and tasks encountered by the deployed systems will not be\nlimited to the original training context, and systems will instead need to\nadapt to novel distributions and tasks while deployed. This critical gap may be\naddressed through the development of \"Lifelong Learning\" systems that are\ncapable of 1) Continuous Learning, 2) Transfer and Adaptation, and 3)\nScalability. Unfortunately, efforts to improve these capabilities are typically\ntreated as distinct areas of research that are assessed independently, without\nregard to the impact of each separate capability on other aspects of the\nsystem. We instead propose a holistic approach, using a suite of metrics and an\nevaluation framework to assess Lifelong Learning in a principled way that is\nagnostic to specific domains or system techniques. Through five case studies,\nwe show that this suite of metrics can inform the development of varied and\ncomplex Lifelong Learning systems. We highlight how the proposed suite of\nmetrics quantifies performance trade-offs present during Lifelong Learning\nsystem development - both the widely discussed Stability-Plasticity dilemma and\nthe newly proposed relationship between Sample Efficient and Robust Learning.\nFurther, we make recommendations for the formulation and use of metrics to\nguide the continuing development of Lifelong Learning systems and assess their\nprogress in the future.",

    "abstract": "Context: Microservices running and being powered by Edge Computing have been\ngaining much attention in the industry and academia. Since 2014, when Martin\nFowler popularized the Microservice term, many studies have been published\nrelating these subjects to explore how the Edge's low-latency feature could be\ncombined with the high throughput of the distributed paradigm from\nMicroservices. Objective: Identifying how Microservices work together with Edge\nComputing whereas they take advantage when running on Edge. Method: In order to\nbetter understand this relationship, we first identified its key concepts,\nwhich are: architecture approaches and features, microservice composition\n(orchestration/choreography), and offloading. Afterward, we conducted a\nSystematic Literature Review (SLR) as the survey method. Results: We reviewed\n111 selected studies and built a taxonomy of Microservices on Edge Computing\ndemonstrating their current architecture approaches and features, composition,\nand offloading modes. Moreover, we identify the research gaps and trends.\nConclusion: This paper is a step forward to help researchers and professionals\nget a general overview of how Microservices and Edge have been related in the\nlast years. It also discusses gaps and research trends. This SLR will also be a\ngood introduction for new researchers in Edge and Microservices.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a general framework for learning across\nheterogeneous clients while preserving data privacy, under the orchestration of\na central server. FL methods often compute gradients of loss functions purely\nlocally (ie. entirely at each client, or entirely at the server), typically\nusing automatic differentiation (AD) techniques. We propose a federated\nautomatic differentiation (FAD) framework that 1) enables computing derivatives\nof functions involving client and server computation as well as communication\nbetween them and 2) operates in a manner compatible with existing federated\ntechnology. In other words, FAD computes derivatives across communication\nboundaries. We show, in analogy with traditional AD, that FAD may be\nimplemented using various accumulation modes, which introduce distinct\ncomputation-communication trade-offs and systems requirements. Further, we show\nthat a broad class of federated computations is closed under these various\nmodes of FAD, implying in particular that if the original computation can be\nimplemented using privacy-preserving primitives, its derivative may be computed\nusing only these same primitives. We then show how FAD can be used to create\nalgorithms that dynamically learn components of the algorithm itself. In\nparticular, we show that FedAvg-style algorithms can exhibit significantly\nimproved performance by using FAD to adjust the server optimization step\nautomatically, or by using FAD to learn weighting schemes for computing\nweighted averages across clients.",

    "abstract": "Accurate local state measurement is important to ensure the reliable\noperation of distributed multi-agent systems (MAS). Existing fault-tolerant\ncontrol strategies generally assume the sensor faults to be bounded and\nuncorrelated. In this paper, we study the ramifications of allowing the sensor\nattack injections to be unbounded and correlated. These malicious sensor\nattacks may bypass the conventional attack-detection methods and compromise the\ncooperative performance and even stability of the distributed networked MAS.\nMoreover, the attackers may gain access to the actuation computing channels and\nmanipulate the control input commands. To this end, we consider the resilient\ncontainment control problem of general linear heterogeneous MAS in the face of\ncorrelated and unbounded sensor attacks, as well as general unbounded actuator\nattacks. We propose an attack-resilient control framework to guarantee the\nuniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop dynamical systems and preserve\nthe bounded containment performance. Compared with existing literature\naddressing bounded faults and/or disturbances that are unintentionally caused\nin the sensor and actuator channels, the proposed control protocols are\nresilient against unknown unbounded attack signals simultaneously injected into\nsensor and actuator channels, and hence are more practical in the real-world\nsecurity applications.

    "abstract": "As a representative of public transportation, the fundamental issue of\nmanaging bike-sharing systems is bike flow prediction. Recent methods\noveremphasize the spatio-temporal correlations in the data, ignoring the\neffects of contextual conditions on the transportation system and the\ninter-regional timevarying causality. In addition, due to the disturbance of\nincomplete observations in the data, random contextual conditions lead to\nspurious correlations between data and features, making the prediction of the\nmodel ineffective in special scenarios. To overcome this issue, we propose a\nSpatio-temporal Neural Structure Causal Model(STNSCM) from the perspective of\ncausality. First, we build a causal graph to describe the traffic prediction,\nand further analyze the causal relationship between the input data, contextual\nconditions, spatiotemporal states, and prediction results. Second, we propose\nto apply the frontdoor criterion to eliminate confounding biases in the feature\nextraction process. Finally, we propose a counterfactual representation\nreasoning module to extrapolate the spatio-temporal state under the factual\nscenario to future counterfactual scenarios to improve the prediction\nperformance. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior\nperformance of our model, especially its resistance to fluctuations caused by\nthe external environment.

    "abstract": "Existing domain generalization aims to learn a generalizable model to perform\nwell even on unseen domains. For many real-world machine learning applications,\nthe data distribution often shifts gradually along domain indices. For example,\na self-driving car with a vision system drives from dawn to dusk, with the sky\ndarkening gradually. Therefore, the system must be able to adapt to changes in\nambient illumination and continue to drive safely on the road. In this paper,\nwe formulate such problems as Evolving Domain Generalization, where a model\naims to generalize well on a target domain by discovering and leveraging the\nevolving pattern of the environment. We then propose Directional Domain\nAugmentation (DDA), which simulates the unseen target features by mapping\nsource data as augmentations through a domain transformer. Specifically, we\nformulate DDA as a bi-level optimization problem and solve it through a novel\nmeta-learning approach in the representation space.

Recent research\ninto compliant and bio-inspired mechanisms for morphing wings and control\nsurfaces has indicated promising results, though often these are mechanically\ncomplex, or limited in the number of degrees-of-freedom (DOF) they can control.\nSeeking to improve on these limitations, we apply a new paradigm denoted\nAutonomous Material Composites to the design of avian-scale morphing wings.\nWith this methodology, we reduce the need for complex actuation and mechanisms,\nand allow for three-dimensional placement of stretchable fiber optic strain\ngauges (Optical Lace) throughout the metamaterial structure. This structure\ncenters around elastomeric conformal lattices, and by applying\nfunctionally-graded warping and thickening to this lattice, we allow for local\ntailoring of the compliance properties to fit the desired morphing. As a\nresult, the wing achieves high-deformation morphing in three DOF: twist,\ncamber, and extension/compression, with these morphed shapes effectively\nmodifying the aerodynamic performance of the wing, as demonstrated in\nlow-Reynolds wind tunnel testing.

To overcome this issue, we present the premier work on\nperforming parameter-efficient VTR from the pre-trained model, i.e., only a\nsmall number of parameters are tunable while freezing the backbone. Towards\nthis goal, we propose a new method dubbed Multimodal Video Adapter (MV-Adapter)\nfor efficiently transferring the knowledge in the pre-trained CLIP from\nimage-text to video-text. Specifically, MV-Adapter adopts bottleneck structures\nin both video and text branches and introduces two novel components. The first\nis a Temporal Adaptation Module employed in the video branch to inject global\nand local temporal contexts. We also learn weights calibrations to adapt to the\ndynamic variations across frames. The second is a Cross-Modal Interaction\nModule that generates weights for video/text branches through a shared\nparameter space, for better aligning between modalities. Thanks to above\ninnovations, MV-Adapter can achieve on-par or better performance than standard\nfine-tuning with negligible parameters overhead. Notably, on five widely used\nVTR benchmarks (MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, DiDemo, and ActivityNet), MV-Adapter\nconsistently outperforms various competing methods in V2T/T2V tasks with large\nmargins.

However, most existing BEV solutions either suffer from\nmodest performance or require considerable resources to execute on-vehicle\ninference. This paper proposes a simple yet effective framework, termed\nFast-BEV, which is capable of performing real-time BEV perception on the\non-vehicle chips. Towards this goal, we first empirically find that the BEV\nrepresentation can be sufficiently powerful without expensive view\ntransformation or depth representation. Starting from M2BEV baseline, we\nfurther introduce (1) a strong data augmentation strategy for both image and\nBEV space to avoid over-fitting (2) a multi-frame feature fusion mechanism to\nleverage the temporal information (3) an optimized deployment-friendly view\ntransformation to speed up the inference. Through experiments, we show Fast-BEV\nmodel family achieves considerable accuracy and efficiency on edge.

In part II,\nwe first present existing results for the rate-distortion problem with proof\nsketches.

By presenting theoretical bounds for\nthese settings, we illustrate the effect of noisy observation of the source,\nthe influence of noisy transmission of the compressed information, the effect\nof using a fixed coding scheme for an arbitrary source and the roles of source\nmemory and variable rate. In part III, we present four multiterminal\ngeneralizations of the rate-distortion problem to consider multiple encoders,\ndecoders or source sequences: the Kaspi problem, the successive refinement\nproblem, the Fu-Yeung problem and the Gray-Wyner problem. By presenting\ntheoretical bounds for these multiterminal problems, we illustrate the role of\nside information, the optimality of stop and transmit, the effect of\nsimultaneous lossless and lossy compression, and the tradeoff between encoders'\nrates in compressing correlated sources.

In this work, we aim to analyze the\neffect of the above trade-off between the modeling error, the terminal value\nfunction error, and the prediction horizon on the performance of a nominal\nreceding-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) controller. By developing a novel\nperturbation result of the Riccati difference equation, a performance upper\nbound is obtained and suggests that for many cases, the prediction horizon\nshould be either 1 or infinity to improve the control performance, depending on\nthe relative difference between the modeling error and the terminal value\nfunction error.

    "abstract": "Product images are the most impressing medium of customer interaction on the\nproduct detail pages of e-commerce websites. Millions of products are onboarded\non to webstore catalogues daily and maintaining a high quality bar for a\nproduct's set of images is a problem at scale. Grouping products by categories,\nclothing is a very high volume and high velocity category and thus deserves its\nown attention. Given the scale it is challenging to monitor the completeness of\nimage set, which adequately details the product for the consumers, which in\nturn often leads to a poor customer experience and thus customer drop off.\nTo supervise the quality and completeness of the images in the product pages\nfor these product types and suggest improvements, we propose a Human Pose\nDetection based unsupervised method to scan the image set of a product for the\nmissing ones. The unsupervised approach suggests a fair approach to sellers\nbased on product and category irrespective of any biases. We first create a\nreference image set of popular products with wholesome imageset. Then we create\nclusters of images to label most desirable poses to form the classes for the\nreference set from these ideal products set. Further, for all test products we\nscan the images for all desired pose classes w.r.t. reference set poses,\ndetermine the missing ones and sort them in the order of potential impact.\nThese missing poses can further be used by the sellers to add enriched product\nlisting image. We gathered data from popular online webstore and surveyed ~200\nproducts manually, a large fraction of which had at least 1 repeated image or\nmissing variant, and sampled 3K products(~20K images) of which a significant\nproportion had scope for adding many image variants as compared to high rated\nproducts which had more than double image variants, indicating that our model\ncan potentially be used on a large scale.",

Algorithm I transforms the singular root-finding\ninto a regular nonlinear least squares problem on a pejorative manifold, and\ncalculates multiple roots simultaneously from a given multiplicity structure\nand initial root approximations. To fulfill the input requirement of Algorithm\nI, we develop a numerical GCD-finder containing a successive singular value\nupdating and an iterative GCD refinement as the main engine of Algorithm II\nthat calculates the multiplicity structure and the initial root approximation.\nWhile limitations of our algorithm exist in identifying the multiplicity\nstructure in certain situations, the combined method calculates multiple roots\nwith high accuracy and consistency in practice without using multiprecision\narithmetic even if the coefficients are inexact. This is perhaps the first\nblackbox-type root-finder with such capabilities. To measure the sensitivity of\nthe multiple roots, a structure-preserving condition number is proposed and\nerror bounds are established. According to our computational experiments and\nerror analysis, a polynomial being ill-conditioned in the conventional sense\ncan be well conditioned with the multiplicity structure being preserved, and\nits multiple roots can be computed with high accuracy.",

Driven by the big data\nrevolution and artificial intelligence, these applications are now essential in\norder to process terabytes of data. They can easily exceed the capabilities of\na single machine, but also demand significant developer time & effort.\nTherefore it is essential to design scalable dataframe solutions. There have\nbeen multiple attempts to tackle this problem, the most notable being the\ndataframe systems developed using distributed computing environments such as\nDask and Ray. Even though Dask/Ray distributed computing features look very\npromising, we perceive that the Dask Dataframes/Ray Datasets still have room\nfor optimization. In this paper, we present CylonFlow, an alternative\ndistributed dataframe execution methodology that enables state-of-the-art\nperformance and scalability on the same Dask/Ray infrastructure (thereby\nsupercharging them!). To achieve this, we integrate a high performance\ndataframe system Cylon, which was originally based on an entirely different\nexecution paradigm, into Dask and Ray. Our experiments show that on a pipeline\nof dataframe operators, CylonFlow achieves 30x more distributed performance\nthan Dask Dataframes.

A brain-computer interface system can be implemented using\nelectroencephalogram signals because it poses more less clinical risk and can\nbe acquired using portable instruments. One of the most interesting tasks for\nthe brain-computer interface system is decoding words from the raw\nelectroencephalogram signals. Before a brain-computer interface may be used by\na new user, current electroencephalogram-based brain-computer interface\nresearch typically necessitates a subject-specific adaption stage.

To do this, we add skip connections between layers, allowing the mutual\ninformation to flow throughout the layers.

While different approaches are developed to find contrasts; these\nmethods do not all deal with mutability and attainability constraints.\nIn this work, we present a novel approach to locally contrast the prediction\nof any classifier. Our Contrastive Entropy-based explanation method, CEnt,\napproximates a model locally by a decision tree to compute entropy information\nof different feature splits. A graph, G, is then built where contrast nodes are\nfound through a one-to-many shortest path search. Contrastive examples are\ngenerated from the shortest path to reflect feature splits that alter model\ndecisions while maintaining lower entropy. We perform local sampling on\nmanifold-like distances computed by variational auto-encoders to reflect data\ndensity. CEnt is the first non-gradient-based contrastive method generating\ndiverse counterfactuals that do not necessarily exist in the training data\nwhile satisfying immutability (ex. race) and semi-immutability (ex. age can\nonly change in an increasing direction). Empirical evaluation on four\nreal-world numerical datasets demonstrates the ability of CEnt in generating\ncounterfactuals that achieve better proximity rates than existing methods\nwithout compromising latency, feasibility, and attainability. We further extend\nCEnt to imagery data to derive visually appealing and useful contrasts between\nclass labels on MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets. Finally, we show how CEnt can\nserve as a tool to detect vulnerabilities of textual classifiers.",

    "title": "Revisiting the Spatial and Temporal Modeling for Few-shot Action  Recognition",
    "abstract": "Spatial and temporal modeling is one of the most core aspects of few-shot\naction recognition. Most previous works mainly focus on long-term temporal\nrelation modeling based on high-level spatial representations, without\nconsidering the crucial low-level spatial features and short-term temporal\nrelations. Actually, the former feature could bring rich local semantic\ninformation, and the latter feature could represent motion characteristics of\nadjacent frames, respectively. In this paper, we propose SloshNet, a new\nframework that revisits the spatial and temporal modeling for few-shot action\nrecognition in a finer manner. First, to exploit the low-level spatial\nfeatures, we design a feature fusion architecture search module to\nautomatically search for the best combination of the low-level and high-level\nspatial features. Next, inspired by the recent transformer, we introduce a\nlong-term temporal modeling module to model the global temporal relations based\non the extracted spatial appearance features. Meanwhile, we design another\nshort-term temporal modeling module to encode the motion characteristics\nbetween adjacent frame representations. After that, the final predictions can\nbe obtained by feeding the embedded rich spatial-temporal features to a common\nframe-level class prototype matcher. We extensively validate the proposed\nSloshNet on four few-shot action recognition datasets, including\nSomething-Something V2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. It achieves favorable\nresults against state-of-the-art methods in all datasets.",

    "abstract": "As a core technology of Intelligent Transportation System, traffic flow\nprediction has a wide range of applications. The fundamental challenge in\ntraffic flow prediction is to effectively model the complex spatial-temporal\ndependencies in traffic data. Spatial-temporal Graph Neural Network (GNN)\nmodels have emerged as one of the most promising methods to solve this problem.\nHowever, GNN-based models have three major limitations for traffic prediction:\ni) Most methods model spatial dependencies in a static manner, which limits the\nability to learn dynamic urban traffic patterns; ii) Most methods only consider\nshort-range spatial information and are unable to capture long-range spatial\ndependencies; iii) These methods ignore the fact that the propagation of\ntraffic conditions between locations has a time delay in traffic systems. To\nthis end, we propose a novel Propagation Delay-aware dynamic long-range\ntransFormer, namely PDFormer, for accurate traffic flow prediction.\nSpecifically, we design a spatial self-attention module to capture the dynamic\nspatial dependencies. Then, two graph masking matrices are introduced to\nhighlight spatial dependencies from short- and long-range views. Moreover, a\ntraffic delay-aware feature transformation module is proposed to empower\nPDFormer with the capability of explicitly modeling the time delay of spatial\ninformation propagation. Extensive experimental results on six real-world\npublic traffic datasets show that our method can not only achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance but also exhibit competitive computational\nefficiency. Moreover, we visualize the learned spatial-temporal attention map\nto make our model highly interpretable.",

To support\nefficient palette-based editing, the color of each layer needs to be as\nrepresentative as possible.

Extensive experiments show that our\njointly-optimized layer decomposition can be used against multiple backbones\nand produce photo-realistic recolored novel-view renderings.

In this work, we explore how sparsity also\naffects the geometry of the linear regions defined by a neural network, and\nconsequently reduces the expected maximum number of linear regions based on the\narchitecture. We observe that pruning affects accuracy similarly to how\nsparsity affects the number of linear regions and our proposed bound for the\nmaximum number. Conversely, we find out that selecting the sparsity across\nlayers to maximize our bound very often improves accuracy in comparison to\npruning as much with the same sparsity in all layers, thereby providing us\nguidance on where to prune.",

Reasoning techniques for concurrent programs, like\nOwicki-Gries-style proof calculi, have to be based on such a semantics, and\nhence need to be freshly developed for every new memory model. Recently, a more\nuniform approach to reasoning has been proposed which builds correctness proofs\non the basis of a number of core axioms. This allows to prove program\ncorrectness independent of memory models, and transfers proofs to specific\nmemory models by showing these to instantiate all axioms required in a proof.\nThe axiomatisation is built on the notion of thread views as first class\nelements in the semantics. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of\nthis form of axiomatic reasoning to the Partial Store Order (PSO) memory model.\nAs the standard semantics for PSO is not based on views, we first of all\nprovide a view-based semantics for PSO and prove it to coincide with the\nstandard semantics. We then show the new view-based semantics to satisfy all\nbut one axiom. The missing axiom refers to message-passing (MP) abilities of\nmemory models, which PSO does not guarantee. As a consequence, only proofs\nwithout usage of the MP axiom are transferable to PSO. We illustrate the\nreasoning technique by proving correctness of a litmus test employing a fence\nto ensure message passing.",

These models are able to\ncapture sophisticated patterns and structures in the data, and can generate\nsamples that are highly diverse and representative of the underlying\ndistribution. However, one of the main limitations of diffusion models is the\ncomplexity of sample generation, since a large number of inference timesteps is\nrequired to faithfully capture the data distribution. In this paper, we present\nMMD-DDM, a novel method for fast sampling of diffusion models. Our approach is\nbased on the idea of using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to finetune the\nlearned distribution with a given budget of timesteps. This allows the\nfinetuned model to significantly improve the speed-quality trade-off, by\nsubstantially increasing fidelity in inference regimes with few steps or,\nequivalently, by reducing the required number of steps to reach a target\nfidelity, thus paving the way for a more practical adoption of diffusion models\nin a wide range of applications. We evaluate our approach on unconditional\nimage generation with extensive experiments across the CIFAR-10, CelebA,\nImageNet and LSUN-Church datasets. Our findings show that the proposed method\nis able to produce high-quality samples in a fraction of the time required by\nwidely-used diffusion models, and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for\naccelerated sampling.

In our research methodology, we gather a large dataset of 3M recent\nMaven packages. We obtain the full transitive set of dependencies for this\ndataset, construct whole-program call graphs, and perform reachability\nanalysis. This approach allows us to identify Maven packages that are actually\naffected by using vulnerable dependencies.

    "abstract": "Toxic misinformation campaigns have caused significant societal harm, e.g.,\naffecting elections and COVID-19 information awareness. Unfortunately, despite\nsuccesses of (gold standard) retrospective studies of misinformation that\nconfirmed their harmful effects after the fact, they arrive too late for timely\nintervention and reduction of such harm. By design, misinformation evades\nretrospective classifiers by exploiting two properties we call new-normal: (1)\nnever-seen-before novelty that cause inescapable generalization challenges for\nprevious classifiers, and (2) massive but short campaigns that end before they\ncan be manually annotated for new classifier training. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose UFIT, which combines two techniques: semantic masking of\nstrong signal keywords to reduce overfitting, and intra-proxy smoothness\nregularization of high-density regions in the latent space to improve\nreliability and maintain accuracy. Evaluation of UFIT on public new-normal\nmisinformation data shows over 30% improvement over existing approaches on\nfuture (and unseen) campaigns. To the best of our knowledge, UFIT is the first\nsuccessful effort to achieve such high level of generalization on new-normal\nmisinformation data with minimal concession (1 to 5%) of accuracy compared to\noracles trained with full knowledge of all campaigns.",

To avoid excessively increasing the number of\nfunctional evaluations and, at the same time, to increase the order of\nconvergence, we freeze the divided differences used from the second step and\nuse a weight function on already evaluated operators. Therefore, we define a\nfamily of multi-step methods with convergence order 2m, where m is the number\nof steps, free of derivatives, with several parameters and with dynamic\nbehaviour, in some cases, similar to Steffensen's method. In addition, we study\nhow to increase the convergence order of the defined family by introducing\nmemory in two different ways: using the usual divided differences and the\nKurchatov divided differences. We perform some numerical experiments to see the\nbehaviour of the proposed family and suggest different weight functions to\nvisualize with dynamical planes in some cases the dynamical behaviour.",

In the proposed sequential approach, robust control is\nimplemented after an exploration phase with the main feature that the\nexploration is optimized w.r.t. the robust control performance. Specifically,\nwe leverage recent results on finite excitation using spectral lines to\ndetermine a high probability lower bound on the resultant finite excitation of\nthe exploration data. This provides an a priori upper bound on the remaining\nmodel uncertainty after exploration, which can further be leveraged in a\ngain-scheduling controller design that guarantees robust performance. This\nleads to a semidefinite program-based design which computes an exploration\nstrategy with finite excitation bounds and minimal energy, and a gain-scheduled\ncontroller with probabilistic performance bounds that can be implemented after\nexploration. The effectiveness of our approach and its benefits over common\nrandom exploration strategies are demonstrated with an example of a system\nwhich is 'hard to learn'.",

Bio-inspired multi-legged robots are a possible\nsolution for safe and precise locomotion.

We verify\nthe proposed approach with dynamic simulations indicating the capability of\nRAMP to generate a safe motion without detachment of the supporting grippers,\nresulting in the robot reaching its specified location.

    "abstract": "Digitalization and sector coupling enable companies to turn into flexumers.\nBy using the flexibility of their multi-energy system (MES), they reduce costs\nand carbon emissions while stabilizing the electricity system. However, to\nidentify the necessary investments in energy conversion and storage\ntechnologies to leverage demand response (DR) potentials, companies need to\nassess the value of flexibility. Therefore, this study quantifies the\nflexibility value of a production company's MES by optimizing the synthesis,\ndesign, and operation of a decarbonizing MES considering self-consumption\noptimization, peak shaving, and integrated DR based on hourly prices and carbon\nemission factors (CEFs). The detailed case study of a beverage company in\nnorthern Germany considers vehicle-to-X of powered industrial trucks,\npower-to-heat on multiple temperatures, wind turbines, photovoltaic systems,\nand energy storage systems (thermal energy, electricity, and hydrogen). We\npropose and apply novel data-driven metrics to evaluate the intensity of\nprice-based and CEF-based DR. The results reveal that flexibility usage reduces\ndecarbonization costs (by 19-80% depending on electricity and carbon removal\nprices), total annual costs, operating carbon emissions, energy-weighted\naverage prices and CEFs, and fossil energy dependency. The results also suggest\nthat a net-zero operational carbon emission MES requires flexibility, which, in\nan economic case, is provided by a combination of different flexible\ntechnologies and storage systems that complement each other. While the value of\nflexibility depends on various market and consumer-specific factors such as\nelectricity or carbon removal prices, this study highlights the importance of\ndemand flexibility for the decarbonization of MESs.",

In this context, existing\noffline methodologies do not account for the variability of human actions and\nstates; therefore, planning and dynamically assigning roles in human-robot\nteams remains an unaddressed challenge.This study aims to create an ergonomic\nrole allocation framework that optimises the HRC, taking into account task\nfeatures and human state measurements. The presented framework consists of two\nmain modules: the first provides the HRC task model, exploiting AND/OR Graphs\n(AOG)s, which we adapted to solve the allocation problem; the second module\ndescribes the ergonomic risk assessment during task execution through a risk\nindicator and updates the AOG-related variables to influence future task\nallocation. The proposed framework can be combined with any time-varying\nergonomic risk indicator that evaluates human cognitive and physical burden. In\nthis work, we tested our framework in an assembly scenario, introducing a risk\nindex named Kinematic Wear.The overall framework has been tested with a\nmulti-subject experiment. The task allocation results and subjective\nevaluations, measured with questionnaires, show that high-risk actions are\ncorrectly recognised and not assigned to humans, reducing fatigue and\nfrustration in collaborative tasks.",

Attributed to\nthe non-convexity, obtaining the existence condition of global NE is\nchallenging, let alone designing theoretically guaranteed realization\nalgorithms. This paper takes conjugate transformation to the formulation of\nnon-convex multi-player games, and casts the complementary problem into a\nvariational inequality (VI) problem with a continuous pseudo-gradient mapping.\nWe then prove the existence condition of global NE: the solution to the VI\nproblem satisfies a duality relation. Based on this VI formulation, we design a\nconjugate-based ordinary differential equation (ODE) to approach global NE,\nwhich is proved to have an exponential convergence rate. To make the dynamics\nmore implementable, we further derive a discretized algorithm. We apply our\nalgorithm to two typical scenarios: multi-player generalized monotone game and\nmulti-player potential game. In the two settings, we prove that the step-size\nsetting is required to be $\\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt k)$ to\nyield the convergence rates of $\\mathcal{O}(1/ k)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt\nk)$, respectively.

    "abstract": "Recently, Optical wireless communication (OWC) have been considered as a key\nelement in the next generation of wireless communications due to its potential\nin supporting unprecedented communication speeds. In this paper, infrared\nlasers referred to as vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) are used\nas transmitters sending information to multiple users. In OWC,\nrate-maximization optimization problems are usually complex due to the high\nnumber of optical access points (APs) needed to ensure coverage. Therefore,\npractical solutions with low computational time are essential to cope with\nfrequent updates in user-requirements that might occur. In this context, we\nformulate an optimization problem to determine the optimal user association and\nresource allocation in the network, while the serving time is partitioned into\na series of time periods. Therefore, cooperative ANN models are designed to\nestimate and predict the association and resource allocation variables for each\nuser such that sub-optimal solutions can be obtained within a certain period of\ntime prior to its actual starting, which makes the solutions valid and in\naccordance with the demands of the users at a given time. The results show the\neffectiveness of the proposed model in maximizing the sum rate of the network\ncompared with counterpart models. Moreover, ANN-based solutions are close to\nthe optimal ones with low computational time.",

In this paper, we\npresent a novel architecture for dynamic role allocation and collaborative task\nplanning in a mixed human-robot team of arbitrary size. The architecture\ncapitalizes on a centralized reactive and modular task-agnostic planning method\nbased on Behavior Trees (BTs), in charge of actions scheduling, while the\nallocation problem is formulated through a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP),\nthat assigns dynamically individual roles or collaborations to the agents of\nthe team. Different metrics used as MILP cost allow the architecture to favor\nvarious aspects of the collaboration (e.g. makespan, ergonomics, human\npreferences). Human preference are identified through a negotiation phase, in\nwhich, an human agent can accept/refuse to execute the assigned task.In\naddition, bilateral communication between humans and the system is achieved\nthrough an Augmented Reality (AR) custom user interface that provides intuitive\nfunctionalities to assist and coordinate workers in different action phases.\nThe computational complexity of the proposed methodology outperforms literature\napproaches in industrial sized jobs and teams (problems up to 50 actions and 20\nagents in the team with collaborations are solved within 1\\;s).

    "abstract": "This paper deals with learning stability of partially observed switched\nlinear systems under arbitrary switching. Such systems are widely used to\ndescribe cyber-physical systems which arise by combining physical systems with\ndigital components. In many real-world applications, the internal states cannot\nbe observed directly. It is thus more realistic to conduct system analysis\nusing the outputs of the system. Stability is one of the most frequent\nrequirement for safety and robustness of cyber-physical systems. Existing\nmethods for analyzing stability of switched linear systems often require the\nknowledge of the parameters and/or all the states of the underlying system. In\nthis paper, we propose an algorithm for deciding stability of switched linear\nsystems under arbitrary switching based purely on observed output data. The\nproposed algorithm essentially relies on an output-based Lyapunov stability\nframework and returns an estimate of the joint spectral radius (JSR).

This advanced mobile communication\ntechnology has more advancements, such as higher system capacity, higher\nspectrum efficiency, higher data rates, and so on. In 5G, Ultra- Dense Network\n(UDN) is deployed for increasing the system capacity and frequency reuse to\nmeet high application requirements. The architecture of 5G UDN is to realize\nthe dense and flexible deployment of smaller general Node B (gNB). However, the\nincreased capacity of applying UDN in 5G is anticipated at the cost of\nincreased signal interference, increased handover times, and increased handover\nfailures. The Time to Trigger (TTT) is one of the most important factors in\nhandover frequency which is deserved to be detected.

In\naddition, different velocities of Traffic Users (TUs) have been applied to the\nsimulation system. From the simulation results, the handover performance has\nbeen analyzed and optimized by applying adjustable TTT under different\ndensities of gNBs which will help people have a better understanding of the\nselection and effect of proper TTT, UDN, and different velocities of TUs on 5G\nhandover performance.",

Presuming it is\ncarried out in appropriate opportunities, refactoring enhances software quality\ncharacteristics such as maintainability and extensibility. Thus far, various\nstudies have addressed the problem of detecting proper opportunities for\nrefactoring. Most of them are based on human expertise and are prone to error\nand non-meticulous. Fortunately, in recent efforts, machine learning methods\nhave produced outstanding results in finding appropriate opportunities for\nrefactoring.

We consider the fairness notion of\nweighted envy-freeness up to one item (WEF1) and propose an efficient picking\nsequence algorithm for computing WEF1 allocations. Our analysis is based on a\nnatural and powerful continuous interpretation for the picking sequence\nalgorithms in the weighted setting, which might be of independent interest.\nUsing this interpretation, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions\nunder which picking sequence algorithms can guarantee other fairness notions in\nthe weighted setting. We also study the existence of fair and efficient\nallocations and propose efficient algorithms for the computation of WEF1 and PO\nallocations for the bi-valued instances. Our result generalizes that of Garg et\nal. (AAAI 2022) and Ebadian et al. (AAMAS 2022) to the weighted setting.

Unlike previous knowledge\ndistillation methods that encourage close student/teacher output only in the\nlast layer, RNAS-CL automatically searches for the best teacher layer to\nsupervise each student layer.

We extract both Author-as-Character features\n(e.g., demographics, narrative event chain, and emotional arc) and\nAuthor-as-Narrator features (i.e., the style and emotion of the story as a\nwhole) in order to identify which aspects of the narrative are correlated with\nthe final moral judgment.

Nevertheless, such\npotential improvement requires an efficient positioning of the FlyBS. In this\npaper, we study the problem of sum downlink capacity maximization in\nFlyBS-assisted networks with mobile users and with a consideration of wireless\nbackhaul with channel reuse while a minimum required capacity to every user is\nguaranteed. The problem is formulated under constraints on the FlyBS's flying\nspeed, propulsion power consumption, and transmission power for both of flying\nand ground base stations. None of the existing solutions maximizing the sum\ncapacity can be applied due to the combination of these practical constraints.\nThis paper pioneers in an inclusion of all these constraints together with\nbackhaul to derive the optimal 3D positions of the FlyBS and to optimize the\ntransmission power allocation for the channels at both backhaul and access\nlinks as the users move over time. The proposed solution is geometrical based,\nand it shows via simulations a significant increase in the sum capacity (up by\n19%-47%) compared with baseline schemes where one or more of the aspects of\nbackhaul communication, transmission power allocation, and FlyBS's positioning\nare not taken into account.",

This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in\nproduction. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative\ntransformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a\nmodality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms\nof transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the\noutput prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a\nparallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity\nneighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and\nimage-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being\ncomputationally efficient.

This\nstudy investigates methods for Knowledge Distillation (KD) to provide efficient\nalternatives to large-scale models. In this context, KD means extracting\ninformation about language encoded in a Neural Network and Lexical Knowledge\nDatabases. We developed two methods to test our hypothesis that efficient\narchitectures can gain knowledge from LMs and extract valuable information from\nlexical sources. First, we present a technique to learn confident probability\ndistribution for Masked Language Modeling by prediction weighting of multiple\nteacher networks. Second, we propose a method for Word Sense Disambiguation\n(WSD) and lexical KD that is general enough to be adapted to many LMs. Our\nresults show that KD with multiple teachers leads to improved training\nconvergence. When using our lexical pre-training method, LM characteristics are\nnot lost, leading to increased performance in Natural Language Understanding\n(NLU) tasks over the state-of-the-art while adding no parameters. Moreover, the\nimproved semantic understanding of our model increased the task performance\nbeyond WSD and NLU in a real-problem scenario (Plagiarism Detection).

    "abstract": "The aviation literature gives relatively little guidance to practitioners\nabout the specifics of architecting systems for safety, particularly the impact\nof architecture on allocating safety requirements, or the relative ease of\nsystem assurance resulting from system or subsystem level architectural\nchoices. As an exemplar, this paper considers common architectural patterns\nused within traditional aviation systems and explores their safety and safety\nassurance implications when applied in the context of integrating artificial\nintelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) based functionality. Considering\nsafety as an architectural property, we discuss both the allocation of safety\nrequirements and the architectural trade-offs involved early in the design\nlifecycle. This approach could be extended to other assured properties, similar\nto safety, such as security. We conclude with a discussion of the safety\nconsiderations that emerge in the context of candidate architectural patterns\nthat have been proposed in the recent literature for enabling autonomy\ncapabilities by integrating AI and ML. A recommendation is made for the\ngeneration of a property-driven architectural pattern catalogue.",

    "abstract": "Learning feature interactions is the key to success for the large-scale CTR\nprediction in Ads ranking and recommender systems. In industry, deep neural\nnetwork-based models are widely adopted for modeling such problems. Researchers\nproposed various neural network architectures for searching and modeling the\nfeature interactions in an end-to-end fashion. However, most methods only learn\nstatic feature interactions and have not fully leveraged deep CTR models'\nrepresentation capacity. In this paper, we propose a new model: DynInt. By\nextending Polynomial-Interaction-Network (PIN), which learns higher-order\ninteractions recursively to be dynamic and data-dependent, DynInt further\nderived two modes for modeling dynamic higher-order interactions: dynamic\nactivation and dynamic parameter. In dynamic activation mode, we adaptively\nadjust the strength of learned interactions by instance-aware activation gating\nnetworks. In dynamic parameter mode, we re-parameterize the parameters by\ndifferent formulations and dynamically generate the parameters by\ninstance-aware parameter generation networks. Through instance-aware gating\nmechanism and dynamic parameter generation, we enable the PIN to model dynamic\ninteraction for potential industry applications. We implement the proposed\nmodel and evaluate the model performance on real-world datasets.

    "abstract": "3D reconstruction is a useful tool for surgical planning and guidance.\nHowever, the lack of available medical data stunts research and development in\nthis field, as supervised deep learning methods for accurate disparity\nestimation rely heavily on large datasets containing ground truth information.\nAlternative approaches to supervision have been explored, such as\nself-supervision, which can reduce or remove entirely the need for ground\ntruth. However, no proposed alternatives have demonstrated performance\ncapabilities close to what would be expected from a supervised setup. This work\naims to alleviate this issue. In this paper, we investigate the learning of\nstructured light projections to enhance the development of direct disparity\nestimation networks. We show for the first time that it is possible to\naccurately learn the projection of structured light on a scene, implicitly\nlearning disparity. Secondly, we \\textcolor{black}{explore the use of a multi\ntask learning (MTL) framework for the joint training of structured light and\ndisparity. We present results which show that MTL with structured light\nimproves disparity training; without increasing the number of model parameters.\nOur MTL setup outperformed the single task learning (STL) network in every\nvalidation test. Notably, in the medical generalisation test, the STL error was\n1.4 times worse than that of the best MTL performance. The benefit of using MTL\nis emphasised when the training data is limited.} A dataset containing\nstereoscopic images, disparity maps and structured light projections on medical\nphantoms and ex vivo tissue was created for evaluation together with virtual\nscenes.

PD is characterized by the gradual loss of dopaminergic\nneurons in the Substantia Nigra (a part of the mid-brain). Counting the number\nof dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra is one of the most important\nindexes in evaluating drug efficacy in PD animal models.

Prior work has focused on\npersonalization of recommendation systems for relatively well-understood tasks\nin the context of e-commerce or social networks. In this paper, we seek to\nunderstand the important factors to consider while designing user-centric\nstrategy recommendation systems for decision-making. We conducted a\nhuman-subjects experiment (n=60) for measuring the preferences of users with\ndifferent personality types towards different strategy recommendation systems.\nWe conducted our experiment across four types of strategy recommendation\nmodalities that have been established in prior work: (1) Single strategy\nrecommendation, (2) Multiple similar recommendations, (3) Multiple diverse\nrecommendations, (4) All possible strategies recommendations. While these\nstrategy recommendation schemes have been explored independently in prior work,\nour study is novel in that we employ all of them simultaneously and in the\ncontext of strategy recommendations, to provide us an in-depth overview of the\nperception of different strategy recommendation systems. We found that certain\npersonality traits, such as conscientiousness, notably impact the preference\ntowards a particular type of system (p < 0.01).

To this end, we propose SwiftAvatar, a novel avatar auto-creation\nframework that is evidently superior to previous works. SwiftAvatar introduces\ndual-domain generators to create pairs of realistic faces and avatar images\nusing shared latent codes.

Through this way, we are able to\nsynthesize paired data in high-quality as many as possible, consisting of\navatar vectors and their corresponding realistic faces.

Recent research studies\nunderlined the importance of content quality by showing that under exploratory\nrecommendation strategies, the network eventually converges to a state where\nthe higher the quality of the CC, the higher their expected number of\nfollowers. In this paper, we extend prior work by (a) looking beyond averages\nto assess the fairness of the process and (b) investigating the importance of\nexploratory recommendations for achieving fair outcomes. Using an analytical\napproach, we show that non-exploratory recommendations converge fast but\nusually lead to unfair outcomes. Moreover, even with exploration, we are only\nguaranteed fair outcomes for the highest (and lowest) quality CCs.",

    "abstract": "The paper studies query evaluation in parallel constant time in the PRAM\nmodel. While it is well-known that all relational algebra queries can be\nevaluated in constant time on an appropriate CRCW-PRAM, this paper is\ninterested in the efficiency of evaluation algorithms, that is, in the number\nof processors or, asymptotically equivalent, in the work. Naive evaluation in\nthe parallel setting results in huge (polynomial) bounds on the work of such\nalgorithms and in presentations of the result sets that can be extremely\nscattered in memory. The paper first discusses some obstacles for constant time\nPRAM query evaluation. It presents algorithms for relational operators that are\nconsiderably more efficient than the naive approaches. Further it explores\nthree settings, in which efficient sequential query evaluation algorithms\nexist: acyclic queries, semi-join algebra queries, and join queries -- the\nlatter in the worst-case optimal framework. Under natural assumptions on the\nrepresentation of the database, the work of the given algorithms matches the\nbest sequential algorithms in the case of semi-join queries, and it comes close\nin the other two settings. An important tool is the compaction technique from\nHagerup (1992).",

    "abstract": "Tsetlin machine (TM) is a logic-based machine learning approach with the\ncrucial advantages of being transparent and hardware-friendly. While TMs match\nor surpass deep learning accuracy for an increasing number of applications,\nlarge clause pools tend to produce clauses with many literals (long clauses).\nAs such, they become less interpretable. Further, longer clauses increase the\nswitching activity of the clause logic in hardware, consuming more power. This\npaper introduces a novel variant of TM learning - Clause Size Constrained TMs\n(CSC-TMs) - where one can set a soft constraint on the clause size. As soon as\na clause includes more literals than the constraint allows, it starts expelling\nliterals. Accordingly, oversized clauses only appear transiently. To evaluate\nCSC-TM, we conduct classification, clustering, and regression experiments on\ntabular data, natural language text, images, and board games. Our results show\nthat CSC-TM maintains accuracy with up to 80 times fewer literals. Indeed, the\naccuracy increases with shorter clauses for TREC, IMDb, and BBC Sports. After\nthe accuracy peaks, it drops gracefully as the clause size approaches a single\nliteral. We finally analyze CSC-TM power consumption and derive new convergence\nproperties.",

To\novercome this, we propose a novel Japanese sentence representation framework,\nJCSE (derived from ``Contrastive learning of Sentence Embeddings for\nJapanese''), that creates training data by generating sentences and\nsynthesizing them with sentences available in a target domain. Specifically, a\npre-trained data generator is finetuned to a target domain using our collected\ncorpus. It is then used to generate contradictory sentence pairs that are used\nin contrastive learning for adapting a Japanese language model to a specific\ntask in the target domain.\nAnother problem of Japanese sentence representation learning is the\ndifficulty of evaluating existing embedding methods due to the lack of\nbenchmark datasets. Thus, we establish a comprehensive Japanese Semantic\nTextual Similarity (STS) benchmark on which various embedding models are\nevaluated. Based on this benchmark result, multiple embedding methods are\nchosen and compared with JCSE on two domain-specific tasks, STS in a clinical\ndomain and information retrieval in an educational domain. The results show\nthat JCSE achieves significant performance improvement surpassing direct\ntransfer and other training strategies.

We assume that sensitive information from individuals is collected\nsequentially and the inferential aim is to estimate, on-the-fly, a static\nparameter regarding the population to which those individuals belong. We\npropose sequential Monte Carlo to perform online Bayesian estimation. When\nindividuals provide sensitive information in response to a query, it is\nnecessary to perturb it with privacy-preserving noise to ensure the privacy of\nthose individuals. The amount of perturbation is proportional to the\nsensitivity of the query, which is determined usually by the range of the\nqueried information. The truncation technique we propose adapts to the\npreviously collected observations to adjust the query range for the next\nindividual. The idea is that, based on previous observations, we can carefully\narrange the interval into which the next individual's information is to be\ntruncated before being perturbed with privacy-preserving noise. In this way, we\naim to design predictive queries with small sensitivity, hence small\nprivacy-preserving noise, enabling more accurate estimation while maintaining\nthe same level of privacy. To decide on the location and the width of the\ninterval, we use an exploration-exploitation approach a la Thompson sampling\nwith an objective function based on the Fisher information of the generated\nobservation.

Existing works\nmainly focus on node-wise correlation when doing weighted aggregation of\nneighboring nodes based on attention, such as dot product by the dense vectors\nof two nodes. This may cause conflicting noise in nodes to be propagated when\ndoing information propagation. To solve this problem, we propose a General\nInformation Propagation Algorithm (GIPA in short), which exploits more\nfine-grained information fusion including bit-wise and feature-wise\ncorrelations based on edge features in their propagation. Specifically, the\nbit-wise correlation calculates the element-wise attention weight through a\nmulti-layer perceptron (MLP) based on the dense representations of two nodes\nand their edge; The feature-wise correlation is based on the one-hot\nrepresentations of node attribute features for feature selection.

For the synchronous clique under\nsimultaneous wake-up, i.e., where all nodes start executing the algorithm in\nround $1$, we show a tradeoff between the number of messages and the amount of\ntime. More specifically, we show that any deterministic algorithm with a\nmessage complexity of $n f(n)$ requires $\\Omega\\left(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\nf(n)+1}\\right)$ rounds, for $f(n) = \\Omega(\\log n)$. Our result holds even if\nthe node IDs are chosen from a relatively small set of size $\\Theta(n\\log n)$,\nas we are able to avoid using Ramsey's theorem. We also give an upper bound\nthat improves over the previously-best tradeoff. Our second contribution for\nthe synchronous clique under simultaneous wake-up is to show that $\\Omega(n\\log\nn)$ is in fact a lower bound on the message complexity that holds for any\ndeterministic algorithm with a termination time $T(n)$. We complement this\nresult by giving a simple deterministic algorithm that achieves leader election\nin sublinear time while sending only $o(n\\log n)$ messages, if the ID space is\nof at most linear size. We also show that Las Vegas algorithms (that never\nfail) require $\\Theta(n)$ messages. For the synchronous clique under\nadversarial wake-up, we show that $\\Omega(n^{3/2})$ is a tight lower bound for\nrandomized $2$-round algorithms. Finally, we turn our attention to the\nasynchronous clique: Assuming adversarial wake-up, we give a randomized\nalgorithm that achieves a message complexity of $O(n^{1 + 1/k})$ and an\nasynchronous time complexity of $k+8$.

    "abstract": "Estimating depth from images nowadays yields outstanding results, both in\nterms of in-domain accuracy and generalization. However, we identify two main\nchallenges that remain open in this field: dealing with non-Lambertian\nmaterials and effectively processing high-resolution images. Purposely, we\npropose a novel dataset that includes accurate and dense ground-truth labels at\nhigh resolution, featuring scenes containing several specular and transparent\nsurfaces. Our acquisition pipeline leverages a novel deep space-time stereo\nframework, enabling easy and accurate labeling with sub-pixel precision. The\ndataset is composed of 606 samples collected in 85 different scenes, each\nsample includes both a high-resolution pair (12 Mpx) as well as an unbalanced\nstereo pair (Left: 12 Mpx, Right: 1.1 Mpx). Additionally, we provide manually\nannotated material segmentation masks and 15K unlabeled samples. We divide the\ndataset into a training set, and two testing sets, the latter devoted to the\nevaluation of stereo and monocular depth estimation networks respectively to\nhighlight the open challenges and future research directions in this field.",

Comparatively, 3D\nposes new challenges stemming from occlusions not depicted in the image. Prior\nworks try to overcome these by inferring from multiple views or rely on scarce\nCAD models and category-specific priors which hinder scaling to novel settings.\nIn this work, we explore single-view 3D reconstruction by learning\ngeneralizable representations inspired by advances in self-supervised learning.\nWe introduce a simple framework that operates on 3D points of single objects or\nwhole scenes coupled with category-agnostic large-scale training from diverse\nRGB-D videos. Our model, Multiview Compressive Coding (MCC), learns to compress\nthe input appearance and geometry to predict the 3D structure by querying a\n3D-aware decoder.

    "abstract": "In this work we introduce a novel medical image style transfer method,\nStyleMapper, that can transfer medical scans to an unseen style with access to\nlimited training data. This is made possible by training our model on unlimited\npossibilities of simulated random medical imaging styles on the training set,\nmaking our work more computationally efficient when compared with other style\ntransfer methods. Moreover, our method enables arbitrary style transfer:\ntransferring images to styles unseen in training. This is useful for medical\nimaging, where images are acquired using different protocols and different\nscanner models, resulting in a variety of styles that data may need to be\ntransferred between. Methods: Our model disentangles image content from style\nand can modify an image's style by simply replacing the style encoding with one\nextracted from a single image of the target style, with no additional\noptimization required. This also allows the model to distinguish between\ndifferent styles of images, including among those that were unseen in training.\nWe propose a formal description of the proposed model. Results: Experimental\nresults on breast magnetic resonance images indicate the effectiveness of our\nmethod for style transfer. Conclusion: Our style transfer method allows for the\nalignment of medical images taken with different scanners into a single unified\nstyle dataset, allowing for the training of other downstream tasks on such a\ndataset for tasks such as classification, object detection and others.",

In the quantum setting, it is also natural to consider\na different notion of complexity, namely the complexity of physically preparing\na certain quantum state. We study the relation between two such state\ncomplexity classes: statePSPACE, which contains states that can be generated by\nspace-uniform polynomial-space quantum circuits, and stateQIP, which contains\nstates that a polynomial-time quantum verifier can generate by interacting with\nan all-powerful untrusted quantum prover. The latter class was recently\nintroduced by Rosenthal and Yuen (ITCS 2022), who proved that statePSPACE\n$\\subseteq$ stateQIP.\nOur main result is the reverse inclusion, stateQIP $\\subseteq$ statePSPACE,\nthereby establishing equality of the two classes and providing a natural\nstate-complexity analogue to the celebrated QIP = PSPACE theorem of Jain, et\nal. (J. ACM 2011). To prove this, we develop a polynomial-space quantum\nalgorithm for solving exponentially large \"PSPACE-computable\" semidefinite\nprograms (SDPs), which also prepares an optimiser encoded in a quantum state.\nOur SDP solver relies on recent block-encoding techniques from quantum\nalgorithms, demonstrating that these techniques are also useful for complexity\ntheory.\nUsing similar techniques, we also show that optimal prover strategies for\ngeneral quantum interactive protocols can be implemented in quantum polynomial\nspace.

However, a\nmajor challenge is developing ML models that can reliably and rapidly\ngeneralize to large data sets with varying experimental conditions. To overcome\nthis challenge, we develop a cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN)\nthat introduces a novel reciprocal space discriminator to augment simulated\ndata with realistic, complex spatial frequency information learned from\nexperimental data. This enables the CycleGAN to generate nearly\nindistinguishable images from real experimental data, while also providing\nlabels for further ML applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this\napproach by training a fully convolutional network (FCN) to identify single\natom defects in a large data set of 4.5 million atoms, which we collected using\nautomated acquisition in an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron\nmicroscope (STEM).

    "abstract": "This paper presents a bi-level optimization framework to compute the\nmaximum-distance race strategies for a fully electric endurance race car,\nwhilst accounting for the low-level vehicle dynamics and the thermal\nlimitations of the powertrain components. Thereby, the lower level computes the\nminimum-stint-time for a given charge time and stint length, whilst the upper\nlevel leverages that information to jointly optimize the stint length, charge\ntime and number of pit stops, in order to maximize the driven distance in the\ncourse of a fixed-time endurance race. Specifically, we first extend a convex\nlap time optimization framework to capture low-level vehicle dynamics and\nthermal models, and use it to create a map linking the charge time and stint\nlength to the achievable stint time. Second, we leverage the map to frame the\nmaximum-race-distance problem as a mixed-integer second order conic program\nthat can be efficiently solved in a few seconds to the global optimum with\noff-the-shelf optimization algorithms. Finally, we showcase our framework on a\n6h race around the Zandvoort circuit. Our results show that the optimal race\nstrategy can involve partially charging the battery, and that, compared to the\ncase where the stints are optimized for a fixed number of pit stops, jointly\noptimizing the stints and number of pit stops can significantly increase the\ndriven distance and hence race performance by several laps.",

    "title": "Nearly Computable Real Numbers",
    "abstract": "In this article we call a sequence $(a_n)_n$ of elements of a metric space\nnearly computably Cauchy if for every strictly increasing computable function\n$r:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N}$ the sequence $(d(a_{r(n+1)},a_{r(n)}))_n$ converges\ncomputably to $0$. We show that there exists a strictly increasing sequence of\nrational numbers that is nearly computably Cauchy and unbounded. Then we call a\nreal number $\\alpha$ nearly computable if there exists a computable sequence\n$(a_n)_n$ of rational numbers that converges to $\\alpha$ and is nearly\ncomputably Cauchy. It is clear that every computable real number is nearly\ncomputable, and it follows from a result by Downey and LaForte (2002) that\nthere exists a nearly computable and left-computable number that is not\ncomputable. We observe that the set of nearly computable real numbers is a real\nclosed field and closed under computable real functions with open domain, but\nnot closed under arbitrary computable real functions. Among other things we\nstrengthen two results by Stephan and Wu (2005) by showing that any nearly\ncomputable real number that is not computable is hyperimmune (and, therefore,\nnot Martin-L\\\"of random) and strongly Kurtz random (and, therefore, not\n$K$-trivial), we strengthen a result by Hoyrup (2017) by showing that any\nnearly computable real number that is not computable is weakly $1$-generic, and\nwe strengthen a result by Downey and LaForte (2002) by showing that no promptly\nsimple set can be Turing reducible to a nearly computable real number.",

    "abstract": "With the vast data-collecting capabilities of current and future high-energy\ncollider experiments, there is an increasing demand for computationally\nefficient simulations. Generative machine learning models enable fast event\ngeneration, yet so far these approaches are largely constrained to fixed data\nstructures and rigid detector geometries. In this paper, we introduce EPiC-GAN\n- equivariant point cloud generative adversarial network - which can produce\npoint clouds of variable multiplicity. This flexible framework is based on deep\nsets and is well suited for simulating sprays of particles called jets. The\ngenerator and discriminator utilize multiple EPiC layers with an interpretable\nglobal latent vector. Crucially, the EPiC layers do not rely on pairwise\ninformation sharing between particles, which leads to a significant speed-up\nover graph- and transformer-based approaches with more complex relation\ndiagrams. We demonstrate that EPiC-GAN scales well to large particle\nmultiplicities and achieves high generation fidelity on benchmark jet\ngeneration tasks.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide.\nOptical colonoscopy is the gold standard for detecting colorectal cancer;\nhowever, about 25 percent of polyps are missed during the procedure. A\nvision-based autonomous endorobot can improve colonoscopy procedures\nsignificantly through systematic, complete screening of the colonic mucosa. The\nreliable robot navigation needed requires a three-dimensional understanding of\nthe environment and lumen tracking to support autonomous tasks. We propose a\nnovel multi-task model that simultaneously predicts dense depth and lumen\nsegmentation with an ensemble of deep networks. The depth estimation\nsub-network is trained in a self-supervised fashion guided by view synthesis;\nthe lumen segmentation sub-network is supervised. The two sub-networks are\ninterconnected with pathways that enable information exchange and thereby\nmutual learning. As the lumen is in the image's deepest visual space, lumen\nsegmentation helps with the depth estimation at the farthest location. In turn,\nthe estimated depth guides the lumen segmentation network as the lumen location\ndefines the farthest scene location. Unlike other environments, view synthesis\noften fails in the colon because of the deformable wall, textureless surface,\nspecularities, and wide field of view image distortions, all challenges that\nour pipeline addresses. We conducted qualitative analysis on a synthetic\ndataset and quantitative analysis on a colon training model and real\ncolonoscopy videos.

We show a quantitative generalization of the 100 year-old Perron-Frobenius\ntheorem, a fundamental theorem which has been used within diverse areas of\nmathematics. The Perron-Frobenius theorem states that every irreducible\nnonnegative matrix $R$ has a largest positive eigenvalue $r$, and every other\neigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $R$ is such that $\\text{Re}\\lambda<r$ and\n$|\\lambda|\\leq r$. We capture the notion of irreducibility through the widely\nstudied notion of edge expansion $\\phi$ of $R$ which intuitively measures how\nwell-connected the underlying digraph of $R$ is, and show a quantitative\nrelation between the spectral gap $\\Delta=1-\\text{Re}\\lambda/r$ (where\n$\\lambda\\not=r$ is the eigenvalue of $R$ with the largest real part) and the\nedge expansion $\\phi$, providing a more general result than the Cheeger-Buser\ninequalities, as\nfollows.\\[\\dfrac{1}{15}\\cdot\\dfrac{\\Delta(R)}{n}\\leq\\phi(R)\\leq\\sqrt{2\\cdot\\Delta(R)}.\\]\n2.

We connect edge expansion and spectral gap to other combinatorial\nproperties of nonsymmetric matrices, such as mixing time and capacity, and\nprovide elementary proofs or unified views of known results and new results\nrelating the different combinatorial/algebraic properties.

    "abstract": "This paper studies causal representation learning problem when the latent\ncausal variables are observed indirectly through an unknown linear\ntransformation. The objectives are: (i) recovering the unknown linear\ntransformation (up to scaling and ordering), and (ii) determining the directed\nacyclic graph (DAG) underlying the latent variables. Since identifiable\nrepresentation learning is impossible based on only observational data, this\npaper uses both observational and interventional data. The interventional data\nis generated under distinct single-node randomized hard and soft interventions.\nThese interventions are assumed to cover all nodes in the latent space. It is\nestablished that the latent DAG structure can be recovered under soft\nrandomized interventions via the following two steps. First, a set of\ntransformation candidates is formed by including all inverting transformations\ncorresponding to which the \\emph{score} function of the transformed variables\nhas the minimal number of coordinates that change between an interventional and\nthe observational environment summed over all pairs. Subsequently, this set is\ndistilled using a simple constraint to recover the latent DAG structure. For\nthe special case of hard randomized interventions, with an additional\nhypothesis testing step, one can also uniquely recover the linear\ntransformation, up to scaling and a valid causal ordering.
