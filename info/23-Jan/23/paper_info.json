    "title": "Enabling Astronaut Self-Scheduling using a Robust Advanced Modelling and  Scheduling system: an assessment during a Mars analogue mission",
    "abstract": "Human long duration exploration missions (LDEMs) raise a number of\ntechnological challenges. This paper addresses the question of the crew\nautonomy: as the distances increase, the communication delays and constraints\ntend to prevent the astronauts from being monitored and supported by a real\ntime ground control. Eventually, future planetary missions will necessarily\nrequire a form of astronaut self-scheduling. We study the usage of a computer\ndecision-support tool by a crew of analog astronauts, during a Mars simulation\nmission conducted at the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS, Mars Society) in\nUtah. The proposed tool, called Romie, belongs to the new category of Robust\nAdvanced Modelling and Scheduling (RAMS) systems. It allows the crew members\n(i) to visually model their scientific objectives and constraints, (ii) to\ncompute near-optimal operational schedules while taking uncertainty into\naccount, (iii) to monitor the execution of past and current activities, and\n(iv) to modify scientific objectives/constraints w.r.t. unforeseen events and\nopportunistic science. In this study, we empirically measure how the\nastronauts, who are novice planners, perform at using such a tool when\nself-scheduling under the realistic assumptions of a simulated Martian\nplanetary habitat.",

    "title": "Causal conditional hidden Markov model for multimodal traffic prediction",
    "abstract": "Multimodal traffic flow can reflect the health of the transportation system,\nand its prediction is crucial to urban traffic management. Recent works\noveremphasize spatio-temporal correlations of traffic flow, ignoring the\nphysical concepts that lead to the generation of observations and their causal\nrelationship. Spatio-temporal correlations are considered unstable under the\ninfluence of different conditions, and spurious correlations may exist in\nobservations. In this paper, we analyze the physical concepts affecting the\ngeneration of multimode traffic flow from the perspective of the observation\ngeneration principle and propose a Causal Conditional Hidden Markov Model\n(CCHMM) to predict multimodal traffic flow. In the latent variables inference\nstage, a posterior network disentangles the causal representations of the\nconcepts of interest from conditional information and observations, and a\ncausal propagation module mines their causal relationship. In the data\ngeneration stage, a prior network samples the causal latent variables from the\nprior distribution and feeds them into the generator to generate multimodal\ntraffic flow. We use a mutually supervised training method for the prior and\nposterior to enhance the identifiability of the model. Experiments on\nreal-world datasets show that CCHMM can effectively disentangle causal\nrepresentations of concepts of interest and identify causality, and accurately\npredict multimodal traffic flow.",

This paper aims to address the simultaneous\nexponential degradation in throughput and quality in a buffered multi-hop\nquantum network. Based on an end-to-end fidelity model with worst-case\n(isotropic) noise, we formulate the high-fidelity remote entanglement\ndistribution problem for a single source-destination pair, and prove its\nNP-hardness. To address the problem, we develop a fully polynomial-time\napproximation scheme for the control plane of the quantum network, and a\ndistributed data plane protocol that achieves the desired long-term throughput\nand worst-case fidelity based on control plane outputs. To evaluate our\nalgorithm and protocol, we develop a discrete-time quantum network simulator.\nSimulation results show the superior performance of our approach compared to\nexisting fidelity-agnostic and fidelity-aware solutions.",

As the use of AI becomes more pervasive within society, the need for\nsocially intelligent agents that are able to navigate these complex dilemmas is\nbecoming increasingly evident. Direct punishment is an ubiquitous social\nmechanism that has been shown to benefit the emergence of cooperation within\nthe natural world, however no prior work has investigated its impact on\npopulations of learning agents. Moreover, although the use of all forms of\npunishment in the natural world is strongly coupled with partner selection and\nreputation, no existing work has provided a holistic analysis of their\ncombination within multi-agent systems. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive analysis of the behaviors and learning dynamics associated with\ndirect punishment in multi-agent reinforcement learning systems and how this\ncompares to third-party punishment, when both forms of punishment are combined\nwith other social mechanisms such as partner selection and reputation.

The next promise of brain-inspired computing is\nto enable adaptation to changes at the edge with online learning. However, the\nparallel and distributed architectures of neuromorphic hardware based on\nco-localized compute and memory imposes locality constraints to the on-chip\nlearning rules. We propose in this work the Event-Based Three-factor Local\nPlasticity (ETLP) rule that uses (1) the pre-synaptic spike trace, (2) the\npost-synaptic membrane voltage and (3) a third factor in the form of projected\nlabels with no error calculation, that also serve as update triggers. We apply\nETLP with feedforward and recurrent spiking neural networks on visual and\nauditory event-based pattern recognition, and compare it to Back-Propagation\nThrough Time (BPTT) and eProp. We show a competitive performance in accuracy\nwith a clear advantage in the computational complexity for ETLP. We also show\nthat when using local plasticity, threshold adaptation in spiking neurons and a\nrecurrent topology are necessary to learn spatio-temporal patterns with a rich\ntemporal structure. Finally, we provide a proof of concept hardware\nimplementation of ETLP on FPGA to highlight the simplicity of its computational\nprimitives and how they can be mapped into neuromorphic hardware for online\nlearning with low-energy consumption and real-time interaction.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel thermodynamically compatible finite volume\nscheme for the numerical solution of the equations of magnetohydrodynamics\n(MHD) in one and two space dimensions. As shown by Godunov in 1972, the MHD\nsystem can be written as overdetermined symmetric hyperbolic and\nthermodynamically compatible (SHTC) system. More precisely, the MHD equations\nare symmetric hyperbolic in the sense of Friedrichs and satisfy the first and\nsecond principles of thermodynamics. In a more recent work on SHTC systems,\n\\cite{Rom1998}, the entropy density is a primary evolution variable, and total\nenergy conservation can be shown to be a \\textit{consequence} that is obtained\nafter a judicious linear combination of all other evolution equations. The\nobjective of this paper is to mimic the SHTC framework also on the discrete\nlevel by directly discretizing the \\textit{entropy inequality}, instead of the\ntotal energy conservation law, while total energy conservation is obtained via\nan appropriate linear combination as a \\textit{consequence} of the\nthermodynamically compatible discretization of all other evolution equations.\nAs such, the proposed finite volume scheme satisfies a discrete cell entropy\ninequality \\textit{by construction} and can be proven to be nonlinearly stable\nin the energy norm due to the discrete energy conservation. In multiple space\ndimensions the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field is taken into\naccount via a new thermodynamically compatible generalized Lagrangian\nmultiplier (GLM) divergence cleaning approach. The fundamental properties of\nthe scheme proposed in this paper are mathematically rigorously proven. The new\nmethod is applied to some standard MHD benchmark problems in one and two space\ndimensions, obtaining good results in all cases.",

    "abstract": "Data availability (DA) attack is a well-known problem in certain blockchains\nwhere users accept an invalid block with unavailable portions. Previous works\nhave used LDPC and 2-D Reed Solomon (2DRS) codes with Merkle trees to mitigate\nDA attacks. These codes perform well across various metrics such as DA\ndetection probability and communication cost. However, these codes are\ndifficult to apply to blockchains with large blocks due to large decoding\ncomplexity and coding fraud proof size (2D-RS codes), and intractable code\nguarantees for large code lengths (LDPC codes). In this paper, we focus on\nlarge block size applications and address the above challenges by proposing the\nnovel Polar Coded Merkle Tree (PCMT): a Merkle tree encoded using the encoding\ngraph of polar codes. We provide a specialized polar code design algorithm\ncalled Sampling Efficient Freezing and an algorithm to prune the polar encoding\ngraph. We demonstrate that the PCMT built using the above techniques results in\na better DA detection probability and communication cost compared to LDPC\ncodes, has a lower coding fraud proof size compared to LDPC and 2D-RS codes,\nprovides tractable code guarantees at large code lengths (similar to 2D-RS\ncodes), and has comparable decoding complexity to 2D-RS and LDPC codes.",

Even though VNF deployment can be flexible, it is\nstill challenging to optimize VNF deployment due to its high complexity.\nSeveral studies have approached the task as dynamic programming, e.g., integer\nlinear programming (ILP). However, optimizing VNF deployment for highly complex\nnetworks remains a challenge. Alternatively, reinforcement learning (RL) based\napproaches have been proposed to optimize this task, especially to employ a\nscaling action-based method which can deploy VNFs within less computational\ntime. However, the model architecture can be improved further to generalize to\nthe different networking settings. In this paper, we propose an enhanced model\nwhich can be adapted to more general network settings. We adopt the improved\nGNN architecture and a few techniques to obtain a better node representation\nfor the VNF deployment task. Furthermore, we apply a recently proposed RL\nmethod, phasic policy gradient (PPG), to leverage the shared representation of\nthe service function chain (SFC) generation model from the value function. We\nevaluate the proposed method in various scenarios, achieving a better QoS with\nminimum resource utilization compared to the previous methods.

    "title": "Tacchi: A Pluggable and Low Computational Cost Elastomer Deformation  Simulator for Optical Tactile Sensors",
    "abstract": "Simulation is widely applied in robotics research to save time and resources.\nThere have been several works to simulate optical tactile sensors that leverage\neither a smoothing method or Finite Element Method (FEM). However, elastomer\ndeformation physics is not considered in the former method, whereas the latter\nrequires a massive amount of computational resources like a computer cluster.\nIn this work, we propose a pluggable and low computational cost simulator using\nthe Taichi programming language for simulating optical tactile sensors, named\nas Tacchi . It reconstructs elastomer deformation using particles, which allows\ndeformed elastomer surfaces to be rendered into tactile images and reveals\ncontact information without suffering from high computational costs. Tacchi\nfacilitates creating realistic tactile images in simulation, e.g., ones that\ncapture wear-and-tear defects on object surfaces. In addition, the proposed\nTacchi can be integrated with robotics simulators for a robot system\nsimulation. Experiment results showed that Tacchi can produce images with\nbetter similarity to real images and achieved higher Sim2Real accuracy compared\nto the existing methods. Moreover, it can be connected with MuJoCo and Gazebo\nwith only the requirement of 1G memory space in GPU compared to a computer\ncluster applied for FEM. With Tacchi, physical robot simulation with optical\ntactile sensors becomes possible. All the materials in this paper are available\nat https://github.com/zixichen007115/Tacchi .",

Researchers and\npractitioners extensively proposed various neural network architectures for\nsearching and modeling feature interactions. However, we observe that different\ndatasets favor different neural network architectures and feature interaction\ntypes, suggesting that different feature interaction learning methods may have\ntheir own unique advantages. Inspired by this observation, we propose\nAdaEnsemble: a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts (SparseMoE) architecture that\ncan leverage the strengths of heterogeneous feature interaction experts and\nadaptively learns the routing to a sparse combination of experts for each\nexample, allowing us to build a dynamic hierarchy of the feature interactions\nof different types and orders.

The AdaEnsemble can adaptively choose the\nfeature interaction depth and find the corresponding SparseMoE stacking layer\nto exit and compute prediction from. Therefore, our proposed architecture\ninherits the advantages of the exponential combinations of sparsely gated\nexperts within SparseMoE layers and further dynamically selects the optimal\nfeature interaction depth without executing deeper layers. We implement the\nproposed AdaEnsemble and evaluate its performance on real-world datasets.\nExtensive experiment results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of\nAdaEnsemble over state-of-the-art models.",

The chosen grid arrangement consists\nof a primal simplex mesh composed of triangles or tetrahedra, and an edge-based\n/ face-based staggered dual mesh. The governing equations are discretized in\nconservation form. The nonlinear convective terms of the equations, as well as\nthe viscous stress tensor and the heat flux, are discretized on the dual mesh\nat the aid of an explicit local ADER finite volume scheme, while the implicit\npressure terms are discretized at the aid of a continuous $\\mathbb{P}^{1}$\nfinite element method on the nodes of the primal mesh. In the zero Mach number\nlimit, the new scheme automatically reduces to the hybrid FV/FE approach\nforwarded in \\cite{BFTVC17} for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. As\nsuch, the method is asymptotically consistent with the incompressible limit of\nthe governing equations and can therefore be applied to flows at all Mach\nnumbers. Due to the chosen semi-implicit discretization, the CFL restriction on\nthe time step is only based on the magnitude of the flow velocity and not on\nthe sound speed, hence the method is computationally efficient at low Mach\nnumbers. In the chosen discretization, the only unknown is the scalar pressure\nfield at the new time step. Furthermore, the resulting pressure system is\nsymmetric and positive definite and can therefore be very efficiently solved\nwith a matrix-free conjugate gradient method.\nIn order to assess the capabilities of the new scheme, we show computational\nresults for a large set of benchmark problems that range from the quasi\nincompressible low Mach number regime to compressible flows with shock waves.",

In the following we will denote these methods as HTC\nschemes. In particular, we consider the Euler equations of compressible\ngasdynamics, as well as the more complex Godunov-Peshkov-Romenski (GPR) model\nof continuum mechanics, which, at the aid of suitable relaxation source terms,\nis able to describe nonlinear elasto-plastic solids at large deformations as\nwell as viscous fluids as two special cases of a more general first order\nhyperbolic model of continuum mechanics. The main novelty of the schemes\npresented in this paper lies in the fact that we solve the \\textit{entropy\ninequality} as a primary evolution equation rather than the usual total energy\nconservation law. Instead, total energy conservation is achieved as a mere\nconsequence of a thermodynamically compatible discretization of all the other\nequations. For this, we first construct a discrete framework for the\ncompressible Euler equations that mimics the continuous framework of Godunov's\nseminal paper \\textit{An interesting class of quasilinear systems} of 1961\n\\textit{exactly} at the discrete level. All other terms in the governing\nequations of the more general GPR model, including non-conservative products,\nare judiciously discretized in order to achieve discrete thermodynamic\ncompatibility, with the exact conservation of total energy density as a direct\nconsequence of all the other equations. As a result, the HTC schemes proposed\nin this paper are provably marginally stable in the energy norm and satisfy a\ndiscrete entropy inequality by construction. We show some computational results\nobtained with HTC schemes in one and two space dimensions, considering both the\nfluid limit as well as the solid limit of the governing partial differential\nequations.",

    "abstract": "This work proposes a quasirandom sequence of quadratures for high-dimensional\nmean-field variational inference and a related sparsifying methodology. Each\niterate of the sequence contains two evaluations points that combine to\ncorrectly integrate all univariate quadratic functions, as well as univariate\ncubics if the mean-field factors are symmetric. More importantly, averaging\nresults over short subsequences achieves periodic exactness on a much larger\nspace of multivariate polynomials of quadratic total degree. This framework is\ndevised by first considering stochastic blocked mean-field quadratures, which\nmay be useful in other contexts. By replacing pseudorandom sequences with\nquasirandom sequences, over half of all multivariate quadratic basis functions\nintegrate exactly with only 4 function evaluations, and the exactness dimension\nincreases for longer subsequences. Analysis shows how these efficient integrals\ncharacterize the dominant log-posterior contributions to mean-field variational\napproximations, including diagonal Hessian approximations, to support a robust\nsparsifying methodology in deep learning algorithms. A numerical demonstration\nof this approach on a simple Convolutional Neural Network for MNIST retains\nhigh test accuracy, 96.9%, while training over 98.9% of parameters to zero in\nonly 10 epochs, bearing potential to reduce both storage and energy\nrequirements for deep learning models.",

Unit autonomy is achieved by sparse interaction in time\n\\& space through the combination of a distributed heuristic search, and a\ncascade-driven weight updating scheme governed by two rules: a unit i) adapts\nwhen it receives either a sample, or the weight vector of a neighbor, and ii)\nbroadcasts its weight vector to its neighbors after adapting for a predefined\nnumber of times. Thus, a vector update can trigger an avalanche of adaptation.\nWe map avalanching to a statistical mechanics model, which allows us to\nparametrize the statistical properties of cascading. Using MNIST, we\nempirically investigate the effect of the heuristic search accuracy and the\ncascade parameters on map quality.

    "abstract": "Contraction theory formulates the analysis of nonlinear systems in terms of\nJacobian matrices. Although this provides the potential to develop a linear\nmatrix inequality (LMI) framework for nonlinear control design, conditions are\nimposed not on controllers but on their partial derivatives, which makes\ncontrol design challenging. In this paper, we illustrate this so-called\nintegrability problem can be solved by a non-standard use of Gaussian process\nregression (GPR) for parameterizing controllers and then establish an LMI\nframework of contraction-based control design for nonlinear discrete-time\nsystems, as an easy-to-implement tool. Later on, we consider the case where the\ndrift vector fields are unknown and employ GPR for functional fitting as its\nstandard use. GPR describes learning errors in terms of probability, and thus\nwe further discuss how to incorporate stochastic learning errors into the\nproposed LMI framework.",

    "abstract": "Temporal graph neural network has recently received significant attention due\nto its wide application scenarios, such as bioinformatics, knowledge graphs,\nand social networks. There are some temporal graph neural networks that achieve\nremarkable results. However, these works focus on future event prediction and\nare performed under the assumption that all historical events are observable.\nIn real-world applications, events are not always observable, and estimating\nevent time is as important as predicting future events. In this paper, we\npropose MTGN, a missing event-aware temporal graph neural network, which\nuniformly models evolving graph structure and timing of events to support\npredicting what will happen in the future and when it will happen.MTGN models\nthe dynamic of both observed and missing events as two coupled temporal point\nprocesses, thereby incorporating the effects of missing events into the\nnetwork. Experimental results on several real-world temporal graphs demonstrate\nthat MTGN significantly outperforms existing methods with up to 89% and 112%\nmore accurate time and link prediction.

To address that, we propose Hode, an offloaded video analytic framework\nthat utilizes multiple edge nodes in proximity to expedite pedestrian detection\nwith high-resolution inputs.

In Experiments 1 and 2, we tested human\nparticipants' ability to match the facial identity of a driver in a low\nresolution video to a high resolution facial image.

    "abstract": "In a cloud-native era, the Kubernetes-based workflow engine enables workflow\ncontainerized execution through the inherent abilities of Kubernetes. However,\nwhen encountering continuous workflow requests and unexpected resource request\nspikes, the engine is limited to the current workflow load information for\nresource allocation, which lacks the agility and predictability of resource\nallocation, resulting in over and under-provisioning resources. This mechanism\nseriously hinders workflow execution efficiency and leads to high resource\nwaste. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an adaptive resource allocation\nscheme named ARAS for the Kubernetes-based workflow engines. Considering\npotential future workflow task requests within the current task pod's\nlifecycle, the ARAS uses a resource scaling strategy to allocate resources in\nresponse to high-concurrency workflow scenarios. The ARAS offers resource\ndiscovery, resource evaluation, and allocation functionalities and serves as a\nkey component for our tailored workflow engine (KubeAdaptor). By integrating\nthe ARAS into KubeAdaptor for workflow containerized execution, we demonstrate\nthe practical abilities of KubeAdaptor and the advantages of our ARAS. Compared\nwith the baseline algorithm, experimental evaluation under three distinct\nworkflow arrival patterns shows that ARAS gains time-saving of 9.8% to 40.92%\nin the average total duration of all workflows, time-saving of 26.4% to 79.86%\nin the average duration of individual workflow, and an increase of 1% to 16% in\nCPU and memory resource usage rate.",

We show the consistency of the proposed scheme by proving that the\nmutual information between discretized transceivers converges to that between\ncontinuous transceivers.

However, it can be challenging to capture the inherent\nstructure of the target features accurately due to the lack of supervised\ninformation on the target domain. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel\napproach called Adaptive Local Transfer (ALT) that tries to achieve efficient\nfeature clustering from the perspective of label propagation. ALT divides the\ntarget data into inner and outlier samples based on the adaptive threshold of\nthe learning state, and applies a customized learning strategy to best fits the\ndata property. Specifically, inner samples are utilized for learning\nintra-class structure thanks to their relatively well-clustered properties. The\nlow-density outlier samples are regularized by input consistency to achieve\nhigh accuracy with respect to the ground truth labels. In this way, local\nclustering can be prevented from forming spurious clusters while effectively\npropagating label information among subpopulations.

Most of the previous works use a\nprior map for inspection viewpoint determination and do not consider dynamic\nobstacles. To maximally increase the level of autonomy, this paper proposes a\nvision-based UAV inspection framework for dynamic tunnel environments without\nusing a prior map. Our approach utilizes a hierarchical planning scheme,\ndecomposing the inspection problem into different levels. The high-level\ndecision maker first determines the task for the robot and generates the target\npoint. Then, the mid-level path planner finds the waypoint path and optimizes\nthe collision-free static trajectory. Finally, the static trajectory will be\nfed into the low-level local planner to avoid dynamic obstacles and navigate to\nthe target point. Besides, our framework contains a novel dynamic map module\nthat can simultaneously track dynamic obstacles and represent static obstacles\nbased on an RGB-D camera. After inspection, the Structure-from-Motion (SfM)\npipeline is applied to generate the 3D shape of the target. To our best\nknowledge, this is the first time autonomous inspection has been realized in\nunknown and dynamic tunnel environments.

Such attacks have been shown to ultimately stop the network\nfunctioning in real-time, leading to network breakdowns. There have been\nsignificant works on detecting and defending against similar DoS attacks in\nnon-SDN networks, but detection and protection techniques for SDN against\npacket injection attacks are still in their infancy.

    "abstract": "Fine assembly tasks such as electrical connector insertion have tight\ntolerances and sensitive components, limiting the speed and robustness of robot\nassembly, even when using vision, tactile, or force sensors. Connector\ninsertion is a common industrial task, requiring horizontal alignment errors to\nbe compensated with minimal force, then sufficient force to be brought in the\ninsertion direction. The ability to handle a variety of objects, achieve\nhigh-speeds, and handle a wide range in object position variation are also\ndesired. Soft grippers can allow the gripping of parts with variation in\nsurface geometry, but often focus on gripping alone and may not be able to\nbring the assembly forces required. To achieve high-speed connector insertion,\nthis paper proposes monolithic fingers with structured compliance and\nform-closure features. A finray-effect gripper is adapted to realize structured\n(i.e. directional) stiffness that allows high-speed mechanical search,\nself-alignment in insertion, and sufficient assembly force. The design of the\nfinray ribs and fingertips are investigated, with a final design allowing plug\ninsertion with a tolerance window of up to 7.5 mm at high speed.",

    "abstract": "Depth estimation from light field (LF) images is a fundamental step for some\napplications. Recently, learning-based methods have achieved higher accuracy\nand efficiency than the traditional methods. However, it is costly to obtain\nsufficient depth labels for supervised training. In this paper, we propose an\nunsupervised framework to estimate depth from LF images. First, we design a\ndisparity estimation network (DispNet) with a coarse-to-fine structure to\npredict disparity maps from different view combinations by performing\nmulti-view feature matching to learn the correspondences more effectively. As\nocclusions may cause the violation of photo-consistency, we design an occlusion\nprediction network (OccNet) to predict the occlusion maps, which are used as\nthe element-wise weights of photometric loss to solve the occlusion issue and\nassist the disparity learning. With the disparity maps estimated by multiple\ninput combinations, we propose a disparity fusion strategy based on the\nestimated errors with effective occlusion handling to obtain the final\ndisparity map. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves\nsuperior performance on both the dense and sparse LF images, and also has\nbetter generalization ability to the real-world LF images.",

    "abstract": "A solar sail is one of the most promising space exploration system because of\nits theoretically infinite specific impulse using solar radiation pressure\n(SRP). Recently, some researchers proposed \"transformable spacecrafts\" that can\nactively reconfigure their body configurations with actuatable joints. The\ntransformable spacecrafts are expected to greatly enhance orbit and attitude\ncontrol capability due to its high redundancy in control degree of freedom if\nthey are used as solar sails. However, its large number of input poses\ndifficulties in control, and therefore, previous researchers imposed strong\nconstraints to limit its potential control capabilities. This paper addresses\nnovel attitude control techniques for the transformable spacecrafts under SRP.\nThe authors have constructed two proposed methods; one of those is a joint\nangle optimization to acquire arbitrary SRP force and torque, and the other is\na momentum damping control driven by joint angle actuation. Our proposed\nmethods are formulated in general forms and applicable to any transformable\nsolar sail that consists of flat and thin body components. Validity of the\nproposed methods are confirmed by numerical simulations. This paper contributes\nto making most of the high control redundancy of transformable solar sails\nwithout consuming any expendable propellants, which is expected to greatly\nenhance orbit and attitude control capability.",

    "abstract": "Hypergraphs are a powerful abstraction for modeling high-order relations,\nwhich are ubiquitous in many fields. A hypergraph consists of nodes and\nhyperedges (i.e., subsets of nodes); and there have been a number of attempts\nto extend the notion of $k$-cores, which proved useful with numerous\napplications for pairwise graphs, to hypergraphs. However, the previous\nextensions are based on an unrealistic assumption that hyperedges are fragile,\ni.e., a high-order relation becomes obsolete as soon as a single member leaves\nit.\nIn this work, we propose a new substructure model, called ($k$,\n$t$)-hypercore, based on the assumption that high-order relations remain as\nlong as at least $t$ fraction of the members remain. Specifically, it is\ndefined as the maximal subhypergraph where (1) every node has degree at least\n$k$ in it and (2) at least $t$ fraction of the nodes remain in every hyperedge.\nWe first prove that, given $t$ (or $k$), finding the ($k$, $t$)-hypercore for\nevery possible $k$ (or $t$) can be computed in time linear w.r.t the sum of the\nsizes of hyperedges. Then, we demonstrate that real-world hypergraphs from the\nsame domain share similar ($k$, $t$)-hypercore structures, which capture\ndifferent perspectives depending on $t$. Lastly, we show the successful\napplications of our model in identifying influential nodes, dense\nsubstructures, and vulnerability in hypergraphs.",

    "title": "Revisiting Estimation Bias in Policy Gradients for Deep Reinforcement  Learning",
    "abstract": "We revisit the estimation bias in policy gradients for the discounted\nepisodic Markov decision process (MDP) from Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\nperspective. The objective is formulated theoretically as the expected returns\ndiscounted over the time horizon. One of the major policy gradient biases is\nthe state distribution shift: the state distribution used to estimate the\ngradients differs from the theoretical formulation in that it does not take\ninto account the discount factor. Existing discussion of the influence of this\nbias was limited to the tabular and softmax cases in the literature. Therefore,\nin this paper, we extend it to the DRL setting where the policy is\nparameterized and demonstrate how this bias can lead to suboptimal policies\ntheoretically. We then discuss why the empirically inaccurate implementations\nwith shifted state distribution can still be effective. We show that, despite\nsuch state distribution shift, the policy gradient estimation bias can be\nreduced in the following three ways: 1) a small learning rate; 2) an\nadaptive-learning-rate-based optimizer; and 3) KL regularization. Specifically,\nwe show that a smaller learning rate, or, an adaptive learning rate, such as\nthat used by Adam and RSMProp optimizers, makes the policy optimization robust\nto the bias. We further draw connections between optimizers and the\noptimization regularization to show that both the KL and the reverse KL\nregularization can significantly rectify this bias. Moreover, we provide\nextensive experiments on continuous control tasks to support our analysis. Our\npaper sheds light on how successful PG algorithms optimize policies in the DRL\nsetting, and contributes insights into the practical issues in DRL.",

    "abstract": "Generative models make huge progress to the photorealistic image synthesis in\nrecent years. To enable human to steer the image generation process and\ncustomize the output, many works explore the interpretable dimensions of the\nlatent space in GANs. Existing methods edit the attributes of the output image\nsuch as orientation or color scheme by varying the latent code along certain\ndirections. However, these methods usually require additional human annotations\nfor each pretrained model, and they mostly focus on editing global attributes.\nIn this work, we propose a self-supervised approach to improve the spatial\nsteerability of GANs without searching for steerable directions in the latent\nspace or requiring extra annotations. Specifically, we design randomly sampled\nGaussian heatmaps to be encoded into the intermediate layers of generative\nmodels as spatial inductive bias. Along with training the GAN model from\nscratch, these heatmaps are being aligned with the emerging attention of the\nGAN's discriminator in a self-supervised learning manner. During inference,\nhuman users can intuitively interact with the spatial heatmaps to edit the\noutput image, such as varying the scene layout or moving objects in the scene.\nExtensive experiments show that the proposed method not only enables spatial\nediting over human faces, animal faces, outdoor scenes, and complicated indoor\nscenes, but also brings improvement in synthesis quality.",

However, individual DOs generally tend to inject larger DP noises\nfor stronger privacy provisions (which entails severe degradation of model\nutility), while the curator (i.e., aggregation server) aims to minimize the\noverall effect of added random noises for satisfactory model performance. To\naddress this conflicting goal, we propose a novel dynamic privacy pricing\n(DyPP) game which allows DOs to sell individual privacy (by lowering the scale\nof locally added DP noise) for differentiated economic compensations (offered\nby the curator), thereby enhancing FL model utility. Considering\nmulti-dimensional information asymmetry among players (e.g., DO's data\ndistribution and privacy preference, and curator's maximum affordable payment)\nas well as their varying private information in distinct FL tasks, it is hard\nto directly attain the Nash equilibrium of the mixed-strategy DyPP game.\nAlternatively, we devise a fast reinforcement learning algorithm with two\nlayers to quickly learn the optimal mixed noise-saving strategy of DOs and the\noptimal mixed pricing strategy of the curator without prior knowledge of\nplayers' private information.

Furthermore,\nturbulent regimes are also considered thanks to the $k-\\varepsilon$ model.\nRegarding the transport diffusion stage new schemes of high order of accuracy\nare developed. The CVC Kolgan-type scheme and ADER methodology are extended to\n3D.

The accuracy and stability analysis of\nthe new method are carried out for the advection-diffusion-reaction equation.\nWithin the projection stage the pressure correction is computed by a piecewise\nlinear finite element method. Numerical results are presented, aimed at\nverifying the formal order of accuracy of the scheme and to assess the\nperformance of the method on several realistic test problems.",

    "abstract": "In Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL), model learning is critical\nsince an inaccurate model can bias policy learning via generating misleading\nsamples. However, learning an accurate model can be difficult since the policy\nis continually updated and the induced distribution over visited states used\nfor model learning shifts accordingly. Prior methods alleviate this issue by\nquantifying the uncertainty of model-generated samples. However, these methods\nonly quantify the uncertainty passively after the samples were generated,\nrather than foreseeing the uncertainty before model trajectories fall into\nthose highly uncertain regions. The resulting low-quality samples can induce\nunstable learning targets and hinder the optimization of the policy. Moreover,\nwhile being learned to minimize one-step prediction errors, the model is\ngenerally used to predict for multiple steps, leading to a mismatch between the\nobjectives of model learning and model usage. To this end, we propose\n\\emph{Plan To Predict} (P2P), an MBRL framework that treats the model rollout\nprocess as a sequential decision making problem by reversely considering the\nmodel as a decision maker and the current policy as the dynamics. In this way,\nthe model can quickly adapt to the current policy and foresee the multi-step\nfuture uncertainty when generating trajectories. Theoretically, we show that\nthe performance of P2P can be guaranteed by approximately optimizing a lower\nbound of the true environment return.

    "abstract": "Models of complex systems often consist of multiple interconnected\nsubsystem/component models that are developed by multi-disciplinary teams of\nengineers or scientists. To ensure that such interconnected models can be\napplied for the purpose of simulation and/or control, a reduced-order model for\nthe interconnected dynamics is needed. In the scope of this paper, we pursue\nthis goal by subsystem reduction to warrant modularity of the reduction\napproach. Clearly, by reducing the complexity of the subsystem models, not only\nthe accuracy of the subsystem models is affected, but, consequently, also the\naccuracy of the interconnected model. It is typically difficult to predict a\npriori how the interconnected model accuracy is affected precisely by the\nsubsystem reduction. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a\ntop-down approach which enables the translation of given accuracy requirements\nof the interconnected system model to accuracy requirements at subsystem model\nlevel, by using mathematical tools from robust performance analysis. This\nallows for the independent reduction of subsystem models while guaranteeing the\ndesired accuracy of the interconnected model. In addition, we show how this\ntop-down approach can be used to significantly reduce the interconnected model\nin an illustrative structural dynamics case study.",

The\nconfiguration assumed by these very dense braided stents once deployed within\nthe parent vessel is not easily predictable and medical volumetric images alone\nmay be insufficient to plan the treatment satisfactorily. Therefore, here we\npropose a fast and accurate machine learning and reduced order modelling\nframework, based on finite element simulations, to assist practitioners in the\nplanning and interventional stages. It consists of a first classification step\nto determine a priori whether a simulation will be successful (good conformity\nbetween stent and vessel) or not from a clinical perspective, followed by a\nregression step that provides an approximated solution of the deployed stent\nconfiguration. The latter is achieved using a non-intrusive reduced order\nmodelling scheme that combines the proper orthogonal decomposition algorithm\nand Gaussian process regression. The workflow was validated on an idealised\nintracranial artery with a saccular aneurysm and the effect of six geometrical\nand surgical parameters on the outcome of stent deployment was studied. The\ntwo-step workflow allows the classification of deployment conditions with up to\n95% accuracy and real-time prediction of the stent deployed configuration with\nan average prediction error never greater than the spatial resolution of 3D\nrotational angiography (0.15 mm).

In\nthis regard, emerging RRAMs have attracted considerable interest for their\nunique qualities like low power consumption, high integration potential,\ndurability, and CMOS compatibility. Using RRAMs to imitate the more analog\nstorage behavior of brain synapses is also a promising strategy for further\nimproving memory density and power efficiency. However, RRAM devices display\nstrong stochastic behavior, together with relaxation effects, making it more\nchallenging to precisely control their multi-level storage capability.

Here, we present a new fully digital relaxation-aware method for\ntuning the conductance of analog RRAMs. The method is based on modulating\ndigital pulse widths during erase operations while keeping other parameters\nfixed, and therefore requires no precise alterations to analog parameters like\ncompliance currents or programming voltage amplitudes. Experimental results,\nwith and without relaxation effect awareness, on a 64 RRAM 1T1R HfOx memory\narray of cells, fabricated in 130nm CMOS technology, indicate that it is\npossible to obtain 2-bit memory per cell multi-value storage at the array\nlevel, verified 1000 seconds after programming.",

    "abstract": "We identify a subtle security issue that impacts the design of smart\ncontracts, because agents may themselves deploy smart contracts (side\ncontracts). Typically, equilibria of games are analyzed in vitro, under the\nassumption that players cannot arbitrarily commit to strategies. However,\nequilibria thus obtained do not hold in general in vivo, when games are\ndeployed on a blockchain. Being able to deploy side contracts changes\nfundamental game-theoretic assumptions by inducing a meta-game wherein agents\nstrategize to deploy the best contracts. Not taking side contracts into account\nthus fails to capture an important aspect of deploying smart contracts in\npractice. A game that remains secure when the players can deploy side contracts\nis said to be side contract resilient. We demonstrate the non-triviality of\nside contract resilience by analyzing two smart contracts for decentralized\ncommerce. These contracts have the same intended functionality, but we show\nthat only one is side contract resilient. We then demonstrate a side contract\nattack on first-price auctions, which are the transaction mechanisms used by\nmost major blockchains. We show that an agent may deploy a contract ensuring\ntheir transaction is included in the next block at almost zero cost while\nforcing most other agents to enter into a lottery for the remaining block\nspace. This benefits all the users, but is detrimental to the miners. This\nmight be cause for re-evaluation of the use of auctions in transaction fee\nmechanisms. We show that the attack works under certain conditions that hold\nwith high probability from natural distributions. The attack also works against\nthe transaction mechanism EIP-1559. Our work highlights an issue that is\nnecessary to address to ensure the secure deployment of smart contracts and\nsuggests that other contracts already deployed on major blockchains may be\nsusceptible to these attacks.",

    "title": "Clustering Human Mobility with Multiple Spaces",
    "abstract": "Human mobility clustering is an important problem for understanding human\nmobility behaviors (e.g., work and school commutes). Existing methods typically\ncontain two steps: choosing or learning a mobility representation and applying\na clustering algorithm to the representation. However, these methods rely on\nstrict visiting orders in trajectories and cannot take advantage of multiple\ntypes of mobility representations. This paper proposes a novel mobility\nclustering method for mobility behavior detection. First, the proposed method\ncontains a permutation-equivalent operation to handle sub-trajectories that\nmight have different visiting orders but similar impacts on mobility behaviors.\nSecond, the proposed method utilizes a variational autoencoder architecture to\nsimultaneously perform clustering in both latent and original spaces. Also, in\norder to handle the bias of a single latent space, our clustering assignment\nprediction considers multiple learned latent spaces at different epochs. This\nway, the proposed method produces accurate results and can provide reliability\nestimates of each trajectory's cluster assignment. The experiment shows that\nthe proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art methods in mobility behavior\ndetection from trajectories with better accuracy and more interpretability.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with a\nprevalence rate estimated to 2.0% for people aged over 65 years. Cardinal motor\nsymptoms of PD such as rigidity and bradykinesia affect the muscles involved in\nthe handwriting process resulting in handwriting abnormalities called PD\ndysgraphia. Nowadays, online handwritten signal (signal with temporal\ninformation) acquired by the digitizing tablets is the most advanced approach\nof graphomotor difficulties analysis. Although the basic kinematic features\nwere proved to effectively quantify the symptoms of PD dysgraphia, a recent\nresearch identified that the theory of fractional calculus can be used to\nimprove the graphomotor difficulties analysis. Therefore, in this study, we\nfollow up on our previous research, and we aim to explore the utilization of\nvarious approaches of fractional order derivative (FD) in the analysis of PD\ndysgraphia. For this purpose, we used the repetitive loops task from the\nParkinson's disease handwriting database (PaHaW). Handwritten signals were\nparametrized by the kinematic features employing three FD approximations:\nGr\\\"unwald-Letnikov's, Riemann-Liouville's, and Caputo's. Results of the\ncorrelation analysis revealed a significant relationship between the clinical\nstate and the handwriting features based on the velocity. The extracted\nfeatures by Caputo's FD approximation outperformed the rest of the analyzed FD\napproaches. This was also confirmed by the results of the classification\nanalysis, where the best model trained by Caputo's handwriting features\nresulted in a balanced accuracy of 79.73% with a sensitivity of 83.78% and a\nspecificity of 75.68%.",

    "abstract": "Efficient exploration strategies are vital in tasks such as search-and-rescue\nmissions and disaster surveying. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become\nparticularly popular in such applications, promising to cover large areas at\nhigh speeds. Moreover, with the increasing maturity of onboard UAV perception,\nresearch focus has been shifting toward higher-level reasoning for single- and\nmulti-robot missions. However, autonomous navigation and exploration of\npreviously unknown large spaces still constitutes an open challenge, especially\nwhen the environment is cluttered and exhibits large and frequent occlusions\ndue to high obstacle density, as is the case of forests. Moreover, the problem\nof long-distance wireless communication in such scenes can become a limiting\nfactor, especially when automating the navigation of a UAV swarm. In this\nspirit, this work proposes an exploration strategy that enables UAVs, both\nindividually and in small swarms, to quickly explore complex scenes in a\ndecentralized fashion. By providing the decision-making capabilities to each\nUAV to switch between different execution modes, the proposed strategy strikes\na great balance between cautious exploration of yet completely unknown regions\nand more aggressive exploration of smaller areas of unknown space. This results\nin full coverage of forest areas of variable density, consistently faster than\nthe state of the art. Demonstrating successful deployment with a single UAV as\nwell as a swarm of up to three UAVs, this work sets out the basic principles\nfor multi-root exploration of cluttered scenes, with up to 65% speed up in the\nsingle UAV case and 40% increase in explored area for the same mission time in\nmulti-UAV setups.",

    "abstract": "Expert demonstrations are a rich source of supervision for training visual\nrobotic manipulation policies, but imitation learning methods often require\neither a large number of demonstrations or expensive online expert supervision\nto learn reactive closed-loop behaviors. In this work, we introduce SPARTN\n(Synthetic Perturbations for Augmenting Robot Trajectories via NeRF): a\nfully-offline data augmentation scheme for improving robot policies that use\neye-in-hand cameras. Our approach leverages neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to\nsynthetically inject corrective noise into visual demonstrations, using NeRFs\nto generate perturbed viewpoints while simultaneously calculating the\ncorrective actions. This requires no additional expert supervision or\nenvironment interaction, and distills the geometric information in NeRFs into a\nreal-time reactive RGB-only policy. In a simulated 6-DoF visual grasping\nbenchmark, SPARTN improves success rates by 2.8$\\times$ over imitation learning\nwithout the corrective augmentations and even outperforms some methods that use\nonline supervision. It additionally closes the gap between RGB-only and RGB-D\nsuccess rates, eliminating the previous need for depth sensors. In real-world\n6-DoF robotic grasping experiments from limited human demonstrations, our\nmethod improves absolute success rates by $22.5\\%$ on average, including\nobjects that are traditionally challenging for depth-based methods.

    "abstract": "Mobile CrowdSensing (MCS), through employing considerable workers to sense\nand collect data in a participatory manner, has been recognized as a promising\nparadigm for building many large-scale applications in a cost-effective way,\nsuch as combating COVID-19. The recruitment of trustworthy and high-quality\nworkers is an important research issue for MCS. Previous studies assume that\nthe qualities of workers are known in advance, or the platform knows the\nqualities of workers once it receives their collected data. In reality, to\nreduce their costs and thus maximize revenue, many strategic workers do not\nperform their sensing tasks honestly and report fake data to the platform. So,\nit is very hard for the platform to evaluate the authenticity of the received\ndata. In this paper, an incentive mechanism named Semi-supervision based\nCombinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit reverse Auction (SCMABA) is proposed to solve\nthe recruitment problem of multiple unknown and strategic workers in MCS.\nFirst, we model the worker recruitment as a multi-armed bandit reverse auction\nproblem, and design an UCB-based algorithm to separate the exploration and\nexploitation, considering the Sensing Rates (SRs) of recruited workers as the\ngain of the bandit. Next, a Semi-supervised Sensing Rate Learning (SSRL)\napproach is proposed to quickly and accurately obtain the workers' SRs, which\nconsists of two phases, supervision and self-supervision. Last, SCMABA is\ndesigned organically combining the SRs acquisition mechanism with multi-armed\nbandit reverse auction, where supervised SR learning is used in the\nexploration, and the self-supervised one is used in the exploitation. We prove\nthat our SCMABA achieves truthfulness and individual rationality. Additionally,\nwe exhibit outstanding performances of the SCMABA mechanism through in-depth\nsimulations of real-world data traces.",

In particular, we propose for Petri nets the distributed non-interference\nproperty, called DNI, based on {\\em branching place bisimilarity}\n\\cite{Gor21b}, which is a sensible, decidable equivalence for finite Petri nets\nwith silent moves. Then we focus our attention on the subclass of Petri nets\ncalled {\\em finite-state machines}, which can be represented (up to\nisomorphism) by the simple process algebra CFM \\cite{Gor17}. DNI is very easily\ncheckable on CFM processes, as it is compositional, so that it does does not\nsuffer from the state-space explosion problem. Moreover, we show that DNI can\nbe characterized syntactically on CFM by means of a type system.",

We have developed a novel approach to\nintegrate knowledge from ontologies into the structure of a Transformer network\nwhich we call ontology pre-training: we train the network to predict membership\nin ontology classes as a way to embed the structure of the ontology into the\nnetwork, and subsequently fine-tune the network for the particular prediction\ntask. We apply this approach to a case study in predicting the potential\ntoxicity of a small molecule based on its molecular structure, a challenging\ntask for machine learning in life sciences chemistry. Our approach improves on\nthe state of the art, and moreover has several additional benefits. First, we\nare able to show that the model learns to focus attention on more meaningful\nchemical groups when making predictions with ontology pre-training than\nwithout, paving a path towards greater robustness and interpretability. Second,\nthe training time is reduced after ontology pre-training, indicating that the\nmodel is better placed to learn what matters for toxicity prediction with the\nontology pre-training than without.

    "abstract": "The incorporation of empathic systems in everyday life draws a lot of\nattention from society. Specifically, the use of wearables to perform stress\nregulation is a growing field of research. Among techniques explored, the\nhaptic emulation of lowered physiological signals has been suggested to be\npromising. However, some discrepancies remain in empirical research focusing on\nsuch biofeedback (BF) regarding their efficacy, and the mechanisms underlying\nthe effects of these wearables remains unclear. Moreover, the influence of\nindividual traits on the efficiency of BF has been marginally studied, while it\nhas been shown that personality could impact both stress and its regulation.\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the outcome of interactions with these\ntechnologies from a psycho-physiological standpoint, but also to explore\nwhether personality may influence its efficiency when other interaction devices\nare present. Participants had to play a challenging game while a lowered haptic\nBF of their heart rate was induced on their wrist. Results showed variable\nefficiency of the wearable among the participants: a subjective relaxation was\nevident for the participants exhibiting the highest neurotic and extraverted\ntraits score. Our results highlight the plurality of the modes of action of\nthese techniques, depending on the individual and on the level of stress to\nregulate.

To investigate the impact of\ndriving style on user acceptance, we 1) develop a data-driven approach to\npersonalize driving style and 2) demonstrate that personalization significantly\nimpacts attitudes towards AVs. Our approach learns a high-level model that\ntunes low-level controllers to ensure safe and personalized control of the AV.\nThe key to our approach is learning an informative, personalized embedding that\nrepresents a user's driving style. Our framework is capable of calibrating the\nlevel of aggression so as to optimize driving style based upon driver\npreference.

    "abstract": "Recent research has employed reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to\noptimize long-term user engagement in recommender systems, thereby avoiding\ncommon pitfalls such as user boredom and filter bubbles. They capture the\nsequential and interactive nature of recommendations, and thus offer a\nprincipled way to deal with long-term rewards and avoid myopic behaviors.\nHowever, RL approaches are intractable in the slate recommendation scenario -\nwhere a list of items is recommended at each interaction turn - due to the\ncombinatorial action space. In that setting, an action corresponds to a slate\nthat may contain any combination of items.\nWhile previous work has proposed well-chosen decompositions of actions so as\nto ensure tractability, these rely on restrictive and sometimes unrealistic\nassumptions. Instead, in this work we propose to encode slates in a continuous,\nlow-dimensional latent space learned by a variational auto-encoder. Then, the\nRL agent selects continuous actions in this latent space, which are ultimately\ndecoded into the corresponding slates. By doing so, we are able to (i) relax\nassumptions required by previous work, and (ii) improve the quality of the\naction selection by modeling full slates instead of independent items, in\nparticular by enabling diversity. Our experiments performed on a wide array of\nsimulated environments confirm the effectiveness of our generative modeling of\nslates over baselines in practical scenarios where the restrictive assumptions\nunderlying the baselines are lifted. Our findings suggest that representation\nlearning using generative models is a promising direction towards generalizable\nRL-based slate recommendation.",

For long-distance communication, many\nresearch projects have been conducted towards using a network composed of\nhigh-altitude platforms (HAPs) flying at an elevation of 20 km to carry\nintermediate FSO transceivers that forward data between ground stations. The\nclear environment at high elevations prevents terrestrial obstacles from\ncutting the LoS between the transceivers. An FSO transceiver on a HAP can\ncommunicate with ground stations within a small area owing to its limited beam\nsize. We suggest using multiple FSO transceivers on a HAP to extend its ground\ncoverage. However, the use of too many FSO transceivers may quickly exhaust the\nonboard energy of the HAP. As a result, HAP must be lowered to recharge\nfrequently. In this study, we first propose a configuration of multiple FSO\ntransceivers to widen the ground coverage of a HAP. We then propose a set of\nclosed-form expressions to calculate the extended coverage. Finally, to\nimplement a HAP network using multiple FSO transceivers, we seek the optimal\nconfiguration of multiple FSO transceivers that minimizes the total cost of the\nHAP network, including amortization, energy, and maintenance costs. The\nsimulation results show that the proposed multiple FSO transceiver\nconfiguration clearly increases the ground coverage of a HAP and significantly\nreduces the cost of the HAP network.",

We\nconclude that ViTMem provides a new step forward, and propose that ViT-derived\nmodels can replace CNNs for computational prediction of image memorability.\nResearchers, educators, advertisers, visual designers and other interested\nparties can leverage the model to improve the memorability of their image\nmaterial.",

    "abstract": "Human mobility estimation is crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic due to its\nsignificant guidance for policymakers to make non-pharmaceutical interventions.\nWhile deep learning approaches outperform conventional estimation techniques on\ntasks with abundant training data, the continuously evolving pandemic poses a\nsignificant challenge to solving this problem due to data nonstationarity,\nlimited observations, and complex social contexts. Prior works on mobility\nestimation either focus on a single city or lack the ability to model the\nspatio-temporal dependencies across cities and time periods. To address these\nissues, we make the first attempt to tackle the cross-city human mobility\nestimation problem through a deep meta-generative framework. We propose a\nSpatio-Temporal Meta-Generative Adversarial Network (STORM-GAN) model that\nestimates dynamic human mobility responses under a set of social and policy\nconditions related to COVID-19. Facilitated by a novel spatio-temporal\ntask-based graph (STTG) embedding, STORM-GAN is capable of learning shared\nknowledge from a spatio-temporal distribution of estimation tasks and quickly\nadapting to new cities and time periods with limited training samples. The STTG\nembedding component is designed to capture the similarities among cities to\nmitigate cross-task heterogeneity. Experimental results on real-world data show\nthat the proposed approach can greatly improve estimation performance and\nout-perform baselines.",

    "abstract": "To support software developers in finding and fixing software bugs, several\nautomated program repair techniques have been introduced. Given a test suite,\nstandard methods usually either synthesize a repair, or navigate a search space\nof software edits to find test-suite passing variants. Recent program repair\nmethods are based on deep learning approaches. One of these novel methods,\nwhich is not primarily intended for automated program repair, but is still\nsuitable for it, is ChatGPT. The bug fixing performance of ChatGPT, however, is\nso far unclear. Therefore, in this paper we evaluate ChatGPT on the standard\nbug fixing benchmark set, QuixBugs, and compare the performance with the\nresults of several other approaches reported in the literature. We find that\nChatGPT's bug fixing performance is competitive to the common deep learning\napproaches CoCoNut and Codex and notably better than the results reported for\nthe standard program repair approaches. In contrast to previous approaches,\nChatGPT offers a dialogue system through which further information, e.g., the\nexpected output for a certain input or an observed error message, can be\nentered. By providing such hints to ChatGPT, its success rate can be further\nincreased, fixing 31 out of 40 bugs, outperforming state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Vehicle volume serves as a critical metric and the fundamental basis for\ntraffic signal control, transportation project prioritization, road maintenance\nplans and more. Traditional methods of quantifying vehicle volume rely on\nmanual counting, video cameras, and loop detectors at a limited number of\nlocations. These efforts require significant labor and cost for expansions.\nResearchers and private sector companies have also explored alternative\nsolutions such as probe vehicle data, while still suffering from a low\npenetration rate. In recent years, along with the technological advancement in\nmobile sensors and mobile networks, Mobile Device Location Data (MDLD) have\nbeen growing dramatically in terms of the spatiotemporal coverage of the\npopulation and its mobility. This paper presents a big-data driven framework\nthat can ingest terabytes of MDLD and estimate vehicle volume at a larger\ngeographical area with a larger sample size. The proposed framework first\nemploys a series of cloud-based computational algorithms to extract multimodal\ntrajectories and trip rosters. A scalable map matching and routing algorithm is\nthen applied to snap and route vehicle trajectories to the roadway network. The\nobserved vehicle counts on each roadway segment are weighted and calibrated\nagainst ground truth control totals, i.e., Annual Vehicle-Miles of Travel\n(AVMT), and Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT). The proposed framework is\nimplemented on the all-street network in the state of Maryland using MDLD for\nthe entire year of 2019. Results indicate that our proposed framework produces\nreliable vehicle volume estimates and also demonstrate its transferability and\nthe generalization ability.",

However, low-quality video is inevitably collected by existing\nsurveillance systems because of poor quality cameras or over-compressed/pruned\nvideo streaming protocols, e.g., as a result of upstream bandwidth limit. To\naddress this issue, existing studies use quality enhancers (e.g., neural\nsuper-resolution) to improve the quality of videos (e.g., resolution) and\neventually ensure inference accuracy. Nevertheless, directly applying quality\nenhancers does not work in practice because it will introduce unacceptable\nlatency. In this paper, we present AccDecoder, a novel accelerated decoder for\nreal-time and neural-enhanced video analytics. AccDecoder can select a few\nframes adaptively via Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to enhance the quality\nby neural super-resolution and then up-scale the unselected frames that\nreference them, which leads to 6-21% accuracy improvement. AccDecoder provides\nefficient inference capability via filtering important frames using DRL for\nDNN-based inference and reusing the results for the other frames via extracting\nthe reference relationship among frames and blocks, which results in a latency\nreduction of 20-80% than baselines.",

However, it is not yet mature enough for a practical use in\nreal-world software development, since usually many training cases are required\nto generate programs that generalize to unseen test cases. As in practice, the\ntraining cases have to be expensively hand-labeled by the user, we need an\napproach to check the program behavior with a lower number of training cases.\nMetamorphic testing needs no labeled input/output examples. Instead, the\nprogram is executed multiple times, first on a given (randomly generated)\ninput, followed by related inputs to check whether certain user-defined\nrelations between the observed outputs hold. In this work, we suggest MTGP,\nwhich combines metamorphic testing and genetic programming and study its\nperformance and the generalizability of the generated programs. Further, we\nanalyze how the generalizability depends on the number of given labeled\ntraining cases. We find that using metamorphic testing combined with labeled\ntraining cases leads to a higher generalization rate than the use of labeled\ntraining cases alone in almost all studied configurations.

Recently, it finds applications in blockchain,\nwhere several users want to jointly authorize a payment through a\nmulti-signature. However, in this setting, there is no centralized authority\nand it could suffer from a rogue key attack where the attacker can generate his\nown keys arbitrarily. Further, to minimize the storage on blockchain, it is\ndesired that the aggregated public-key and the aggregated signature are both as\nshort as possible. In this paper, we find a compiler that converts a kind of\nidentification (ID) scheme (which we call a linear ID) to a multi-signature so\nthat both the aggregated public-key and the aggregated signature have a size\nindependent of the number of signers. Our compiler is provably secure. The\nadvantage of our results is that we reduce a multi-party problem to a weakly\nsecure two-party problem. We realize our compiler with two ID schemes.

In offline settings, many dependent rounding\nschemes achieving a ratio of one and strong negative correlation properties are\nknown (e.g., Gandhi et al., J.ACM'06 and Chekuri et al., FOCS'10), and have\nfound numerous applications. Motivated by online applications, we present\n\\emph{online dependent-rounding schemes} (ODRSes) for $b$-matching.\nFor the special case of uniform matroids (single offline node), we present a\nsimple online algorithm with a rounding ratio of one. Interestingly, we show\nthat our algorithm yields \\emph{the same distribution} as its classic offline\ncounterpart, pivotal sampling (Srinivasan, FOCS'01), and so inherits the\nlatter's strong correlation properties.

A coded scheme is derived to satisfy the above constraints by\nincoporating the idea of secret sharing and key superposition into the\nframework of Placement Delivery Array (PDA), originally proposed to\ncharacterize the single-server coded caching system without any security or\nprivacy constraints, where the memory size at each user, the storage size at\neach server and the total communication load over all servers are characterized\nby the PDA parameters. It is shown that the PDAs describing the original\nMaddah-Ali and Niesen's coded caching scheme result in an achievable\nmemory-storage-communication region, such that the storage size and the\ncommunication load are optimal to within a constant multiplicative gap, except\nfor the small memory regime when the number of files is smaller than the number\nof users.",

    "abstract": "We present Propulate, an evolutionary optimization algorithm and software\npackage for global optimization and in particular hyperparameter search. For\nefficient use of HPC resources, Propulate omits the synchronization after each\ngeneration as done in conventional genetic algorithms. Instead, it steers the\nsearch with the complete population present at time of breeding new\nindividuals. We provide an MPI-based implementation of our algorithm, which\nfeatures variants of selection, mutation, crossover, and migration and is easy\nto extend with custom functionality. We compare Propulate to the established\noptimization tool Optuna. We find that Propulate is up to three orders of\nmagnitude faster without sacrificing solution accuracy, demonstrating the\nefficiency and efficacy of our lazy synchronization approach.

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the development of minimum time control profiles for\npoint-to-point motion of a gantry crane system in the presence of uncertainties\nin modal parameters. Assuming that the velocity of the trolley of the crane can\nbe commanded and is subject to limits, an optimal control problem is posed to\ndetermine the bang-off-bang control profile to transition the system from a\npoint of rest to the terminal states with no residual vibrations. Both undamped\nand underdamped systems are considered and the variation of the structure of\nthe optimal control profiles as a function of the final displacement is\nstudied. As the magnitude of the rigid body displacement is increased, the\ncollapse and birthing of switches in the optimal control profile are observed\nand explained. Robustness to uncertainties in modal parameters is accounted for\nby forcing the state sensitivities at the terminal time to zero. The\nobservation that the time-optimal control profile merges with the robust\ntime-optimal control is noted for specific terminal displacements and the\nmigration of zeros of the time-delay filter parameterizing the optimal control\nprofile are used to explain this counter intuitive result. A two degree of\nfreedom gantry crane system is used to experimentally validate the observations\nof the numerical studies and the tradeoff of increase in maneuver time to the\nreduction of residual vibrations is experimentally illustrated.",

This rapid and\ndynamic updating of comprehenders' expectations about the kind of events that a\npeanut may take part in based on context has been explained using the construct\nof Situation Models - updated mental representations of key elements of an\nevent under discussion, in this case, the peanut protagonist. However, recent\nwork showing that N400 amplitude can be predicted based on distributional\ninformation alone raises the question whether situation models are in fact\nnecessary for the kinds of contextual effects observed in previous work. To\ninvestigate this question, we attempt to model the results of Nieuwland and van\nBerkum (2006) using six computational language models and three sets of word\nvectors, none of which have explicit situation models or semantic grounding. We\nfind that the effect found by Nieuwland and van Berkum (2006) can be fully\nmodeled by two language models and two sets of word vectors, with others\nshowing a reduced effect.

    "abstract": "Transformer, as an alternative to CNN, has been proven effective in many\nmodalities (e.g., texts and images). For 3D point cloud transformers, existing\nefforts focus primarily on pushing their accuracy to the state-of-the-art\nlevel. However, their latency lags behind sparse convolution-based models (3x\nslower), hindering their usage in resource-constrained, latency-sensitive\napplications (such as autonomous driving). This inefficiency comes from point\nclouds' sparse and irregular nature, whereas transformers are designed for\ndense, regular workloads. This paper presents FlatFormer to close this latency\ngap by trading spatial proximity for better computational regularity. We first\nflatten the point cloud with window-based sorting and partition points into\ngroups of equal sizes rather than windows of equal shapes. This effectively\navoids expensive structuring and padding overheads. We then apply\nself-attention within groups to extract local features, alternate sorting axis\nto gather features from different directions, and shift windows to exchange\nfeatures across groups. FlatFormer delivers state-of-the-art accuracy on Waymo\nOpen Dataset with 4.6x speedup over (transformer-based) SST and 1.4x speedup\nover (sparse convolutional) CenterPoint. This is the first point cloud\ntransformer that achieves real-time performance on edge GPUs and is faster than\nsparse convolutional methods while achieving on-par or even superior accuracy\non large-scale benchmarks.

    "abstract": "The possibility for hydrocarbon fluids to migrate through debonded\nmicro-annuli wells is a major concern in the petroleum industry. With effective\npermeability of 0.1-1.0 mD, the existence of channels in a cement annulus with\napertures of 10-300 micrometer constitutes a major threat. Squeeze cement is\ntypically difficult to repair channels-leakage with small apertures; hence, a\nlow-viscosity sealer that can be inserted into these channels while producing a\nlong-term resilient seal is sought. A novel application using nano-silica\nsealants could be the key to seal these channels. In the construction and\nsealing of hydrocarbon wells, cementing is a critical phase. Cement is prone to\ncracking during the life cycle of a well because of the changes in downhole\nconditions. The usage of micro-sized cross-linked nano-silica gel as a sealant\nmaterial to minimize damaged cement sheaths is investigated in this study.\nFluid leakage through channels in the cement was investigated using an\nexperimental system. With a diameter of 0.05 inches, the impact of the cement\nchannel size was explored. The sealing efficiency increased from 86 percent to\n95 percent when the nano-silica concentration of the sealing gel increased from\n13 percent to 25 percent. This demonstrates that the concentration of\nnano-silica in the sealing gel affects the gel's ability to seal against fluid\nflow. This research proposes a new way for improving cement zonal isolation and\nthereby lowering the impact of cement failure in the oil and gas industry.",

    "abstract": "Pathological brain lesions exhibit diverse appearance in brain images, in\nterms of intensity, texture, shape, size, and location. Comprehensive sets of\ndata and annotations are difficult to acquire. Therefore, unsupervised anomaly\ndetection approaches have been proposed using only normal data for training,\nwith the aim of detecting outlier anomalous voxels at test time. Denoising\nmethods, for instance classical denoising autoencoders (DAEs) and more recently\nemerging diffusion models, are a promising approach, however naive application\nof pixelwise noise leads to poor anomaly detection performance. We show that\noptimization of the spatial resolution and magnitude of the noise improves the\nperformance of different model training regimes, with similar noise parameter\nadjustments giving good performance for both DAEs and diffusion models. Visual\ninspection of the reconstructions suggests that the training noise influences\nthe trade-off between the extent of the detail that is reconstructed and the\nextent of erasure of anomalies, both of which contribute to better anomaly\ndetection performance. We validate our findings on two real-world datasets\n(tumor detection in brain MRI and hemorrhage/ischemia/tumor detection in brain\nCT), showing good detection on diverse anomaly appearances. Overall, we find\nthat a DAE trained with coarse noise is a fast and simple method that gives\nstate-of-the-art accuracy. Diffusion models applied to anomaly detection are as\nyet in their infancy and provide a promising avenue for further research.",

A new kind of diffusive\nregularization, of Allen-Cahn type, is introduced in the transport equation for\nthe deformation gradient, together with a regularizing interface term depending\non the gradient of the deformation gradient in the free energy of the system.\nWe study the global existence of a weak solution for the model. While standard\ndiffusive regularizations of the transport equation for the deformation\ngradient presented in literature allows the existence study only for simplified\ncases, i.e. in two space dimensions and for convex elastic free energy\ndensities of Neo-Hookean type which are independent from the phase field\nvariable, the present regularization allows to study more general cases. In\nparticular, we obtain the global existence of a weak solution in three space\ndimensions and for generic nonlinear elastic energy densities with polynomial\ngrowth. Our analysis considers elastic free energy densities which depend on\nthe phase field variable and which can possibly degenerate for some values of\nthe phase field variable. By means of an iterative argument based on elliptic\nregularity bootstrap steps, we find the maximum allowed polynomial growths of\nthe Cahn-Hilliard potential and the elastic energy density which guarantee the\nexistence of a solution in three space dimensions. We propose two\nunconditionally energy stable finite element approximations of the model, based\non convex splitting ideas and on the use of a scalar auxiliary variable,\nproving the existence and stability of discrete solutions.

It\naims at building a visual stimuli recognition system customized for the target\nsubject whose EEG samples are limited, by transferring knowledge from abundant\ndata of source subjects. Existing approaches consider the scenario that samples\nof source subjects are accessible during training. However, it is often\ninfeasible and problematic to access personal biological data like EEG signals\ndue to privacy issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel and practical\nproblem setup, namely source-free subject adaptation, where the source subject\ndata are unavailable and only the pre-trained model parameters are provided for\nsubject adaptation. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose\nclassifier-based data generation to simulate EEG samples from source subjects\nusing classifier responses. Using the generated samples and target subject\ndata, we perform subject-independent feature learning to exploit the common\nknowledge shared across different subjects. Notably, our framework is\ngeneralizable and can adopt any subject-independent learning method.

And finally, we trained classification\nmodels for each task separately as well as a model for their combination to\nestimate the predictive power of the features for the identification of LBDs.\nUsing this approach we were able to identify prodromal LBDs with 74% accuracy\nand showed the promising potential of computerized objective and non-invasive\ndiagnosis of LBDs based on the assessment of graphomotor and handwriting\ndifficulties.",

    "abstract": "We provide a critique of mathematical biology in light of rapid developments\nin modern machine learning. We argue that out of the three modelling activities\n-- (1) formulating models; (2) analysing models; and (3) fitting or comparing\nmodels to data -- inherent to mathematical biology, researchers currently focus\ntoo much on activity (2) at the cost of (1). This trend, we propose, can be\nreversed by realising that any given biological phenomena can be modelled in an\ninfinite number of different ways, through the adoption of an open/pluralistic\napproach. We explain the open approach using fish locomotion as a case study\nand illustrate some of the pitfalls -- universalism, creating models of models,\netc. -- that hinder mathematical biology. We then ask how we might rediscover a\nlost art: that of creative mathematical modelling.\nThis article is dedicated to the memory of Edmund Crampin.",

The outcome of a policy is measured in terms of\na loss or disutility (or negative reward) and the problem is to draw valid\ninferences about the out-of-sample loss of the specified policy when the past\ndata is observed under a, possibly unknown, policy. Using a sample-splitting\nmethod, we show that it is possible to draw such inferences with finite-sample\ncoverage guarantees that evaluate the entire loss distribution. Importantly,\nthe method takes into account model misspecifications of the past policy --\nincluding unmeasured confounding.

One such problem is the capacitive cross-talk between the metallic\ngates that define and control QD qubits. A way to compensate for the capacitive\ncross-talk and enable targeted control of specific QDs independent of coupling\nis by the use of virtual gates. Here, we demonstrate a reliable automated\ncapacitive coupling identification method that combines machine learning with\ntraditional fitting to take advantage of the desirable properties of each. We\nalso show how the cross-capacitance measurement may be used for the\nidentification of spurious QDs sometimes formed during tuning experimental\ndevices. Our systems can autonomously flag devices with spurious dots near the\noperating regime which is crucial information for reliable tuning to a regime\nsuitable for qubit operations.",

    "abstract": "We propose an algorithm to solve optimization problems constrained by partial\n(ordinary) differential equations under uncertainty, with almost sure\nconstraints on the state variable. To alleviate the computational burden of\nhigh-dimensional random variables, we approximate all random fields by the\ntensor-train decomposition. To enable efficient tensor-train approximation of\nthe state constraints, the latter are handled using the Moreau-Yosida penalty,\nwith an additional smoothing of the positive part (plus/ReLU) function by a\nsoftplus function. We derive theoretical bounds on the constraint violation in\nterms of the Moreau-Yosida regularization parameter and smoothing width of the\nsoftplus function. This result also proposes a practical recipe for selecting\nthese two parameters. When the optimization problem is strongly convex, we\nestablish strong convergence of the regularized solution to the optimal\ncontrol. We develop a second order Newton type method with a fast matrix-free\naction of the approximate Hessian to solve the smoothed Moreau-Yosida problem.\nThis algorithm is tested on benchmark elliptic problems with random\ncoefficients, optimization problems constrained by random elliptic variational\ninequalities, and a real-world epidemiological model with 20 random variables.\nThese examples demonstrate mild (at most polynomial) scaling with respect to\nthe dimension and regularization parameters.",

Based on the ABIDES limit order book simulator, we\nbuild a reinforcement learning OpenAI gym environment and utilise it to\nsimulate a realistic trading environment for NASDAQ equities based on historic\norder book messages. To train a trading agent that learns to maximise its\ntrading return in this environment, we use Deep Duelling Double Q-learning with\nthe APEX (asynchronous prioritised experience replay) architecture. The agent\nobserves the current limit order book state, its recent history, and a\nshort-term directional forecast. To investigate the performance of RL for\nadaptive trading independently from a concrete forecasting algorithm, we study\nthe performance of our approach utilising synthetic alpha signals obtained by\nperturbing forward-looking returns with varying levels of noise. Here, we find\nthat the RL agent learns an effective trading strategy for inventory management\nand order placing that outperforms a heuristic benchmark trading strategy\nhaving access to the same signal.",
