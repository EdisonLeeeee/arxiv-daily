    "title": "Contextual Conservative Q-Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning learns an effective policy on offline datasets\nwithout online interaction, and it attracts persistent research attention due\nto its potential of practical application. However, extrapolation error\ngenerated by distribution shift will still lead to the overestimation for those\nactions that transit to out-of-distribution(OOD) states, which degrades the\nreliability and robustness of the offline policy. In this paper, we propose\nContextual Conservative Q-Learning(C-CQL) to learn a robustly reliable policy\nthrough the contextual information captured via an inverse dynamics model. With\nthe supervision of the inverse dynamics model, it tends to learn a policy that\ngenerates stable transition at perturbed states, for the fact that pertuebed\nstates are a common kind of OOD states. In this manner, we enable the learnt\npolicy more likely to generate transition that destines to the empirical next\nstate distributions of the offline dataset, i.e., robustly reliable transition.\nBesides, we theoretically reveal that C-CQL is the generalization of the\nConservative Q-Learning(CQL) and aggressive State Deviation Correction(SDC).\nFinally, experimental results demonstrate the proposed C-CQL achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance in most environments of offline Mujoco suite and a\nnoisy Mujoco setting.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning has emerged as an effective paradigm to achieve\nprivacy-preserving collaborative learning among different parties. Compared to\ntraditional centralized learning that requires collecting data from each party,\nin federated learning, only the locally trained models or computed gradients\nare exchanged, without exposing any data information. As a result, it is able\nto protect privacy to some extent. In recent years, federated learning has\nbecome more and more prevalent and there have been many surveys for summarizing\nrelated methods in this hot research topic. However, most of them focus on a\nspecific perspective or lack the latest research progress. In this paper, we\nprovide a systematic survey on federated learning, aiming to review the recent\nadvanced federated methods and applications from different aspects.\nSpecifically, this paper includes four major contributions. First, we present a\nnew taxonomy of federated learning in terms of the pipeline and challenges in\nfederated scenarios. Second, we summarize federated learning methods into\nseveral categories and briefly introduce the state-of-the-art methods under\nthese categories. Third, we overview some prevalent federated learning\nframeworks and introduce their features. Finally, some potential deficiencies\nof current methods and several future directions are discussed.",

    "abstract": "On-orbit close proximity operations involve robotic spacecraft maneuvering\nand making decisions for a growing number of mission scenarios demanding\nautonomy, including on-orbit assembly, repair, and astronaut assistance. Of\nthese scenarios, on-orbit assembly is an enabling technology that will allow\nlarge space structures to be built in-situ, using smaller building block\nmodules. However, robotic on-orbit assembly involves a number of technical\nhurdles such as changing system models. For instance, grappled modules moved by\na free-flying \"assembler\" robot can cause significant shifts in system inertial\nproperties, which has cascading impacts on motion planning and control portions\nof the autonomy stack. Further, on-orbit assembly and other scenarios require\ncollision-avoiding motion planning, particularly when operating in a\n\"construction site\" scenario of multiple assembler robots and structures. These\ncomplicating factors, relevant to many autonomous microgravity robotics use\ncases, are tackled in the ReSWARM flight experiments as a set of tests on the\nInternational Space Station using NASA's Astrobee robots. RElative Satellite\nsWarming and Robotic Maneuvering, or ReSWARM, demonstrates multiple key\ntechnologies for close proximity operations and on-orbit assembly: (1) global\nlong-horizon planning, accomplished using offline and online sampling-based\nplanner options that consider the system dynamics; (2) on-orbit reconfiguration\nmodel learning, using the recently-proposed RATTLE information-aware planning\nframework; and (3) robust control tools to provide low-level control robustness\nusing current system knowledge. These approaches are detailed individually and\nin an \"on-orbit assembly scenario\" of multi-waypoint tracking on-orbit.\nAdditionally, detail is provided discussing the practicalities of hardware\nimplementation and unique aspects of working with Astrobee in microgravity.",

    "abstract": "Currently, when a security analyst discovers a vulnerability in critical\nsoftware system, they must navigate a fraught dilemma: immediately disclosing\nthe vulnerability to the public could harm the system's users; whereas\ndisclosing the vulnerability only to the software's vendor lets the vendor\ndisregard or deprioritize the security risk, to the detriment of\nunwittingly-affected users. A compelling recent line of work aims to resolve\nthis by using Zero Knowledge (ZK) protocols that let analysts prove that they\nknow a vulnerability in a program, without revealing the details of the\nvulnerability or the inputs that exploit it. In principle, this could be\nachieved by generic ZK techniques. In practice, ZK vulnerability proofs to date\nhave been restricted in scope and expressibility, due to challenges related to\ngenerating proof statements that model real-world software at scale and to\ndirectly formulating violated properties. This paper presents CHEESECLOTH, a\nnovel proofstatement compiler, which proves practical vulnerabilities in ZK by\nsoundly-but-aggressively preprocessing programs on public inputs, selectively\nrevealing information about executed control segments, and formalizing\ninformation leakage using a novel storage-labeling scheme. CHEESECLOTH's\npracticality is demonstrated by generating ZK proofs of well-known\nvulnerabilities in (previous versions of) critical software, including the\nHeartbleed information leakage in OpenSSL and a memory vulnerability in the\nFFmpeg graphics framework.",

We\nconsider a generalization of this problem wherein the agents are placed along\nthe vertices of a graph (corresponding to a social network), and each agent can\nonly experience envy towards its neighbors. Our goal is to minimize the\naggregate envy among the agents as a natural fairness objective, i.e., the sum\nof all pairwise envy values over all edges in a social graph.\nWhen agents have identical and evenly-spaced valuations, our problem reduces\nto the well-studied problem of linear arrangements. For identical valuations\nwith possibly uneven spacing, we show a number of deep and surprising ways in\nwhich our setting is a departure from this classical problem. More broadly, we\ncontribute several structural and computational results for various classes of\ngraphs, including NP-hardness results for disjoint unions of paths, cycles,\nstars, or cliques, and fixed-parameter tractable (and, in some cases,\npolynomial-time) algorithms for paths, cycles, stars, cliques, and their\ndisjoint unions.

CapsNets, which were inspired by the\ninformation processing of the human brain, are considered to have more\ninductive bias than CNNs, whereas ViTs are considered to have less inductive\nbias than CNNs. All three classification models have received great attention\nsince they can serve as backbones for various downstream tasks. However, these\nmodels are far from being perfect. As pointed out by the community, there are\ntwo weaknesses in standard Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). One of the limitations\nof DNNs is the lack of explainability. Even though they can achieve or surpass\nhuman expert performance in the image classification task, the DNN-based\ndecisions are difficult to understand. In many real-world applications,\nhowever, individual decisions need to be explained. The other limitation of\nDNNs is adversarial vulnerability. Concretely, the small and imperceptible\nperturbations of inputs can mislead DNNs. The vulnerability of deep neural\nnetworks poses challenges to current visual classification models. The\npotential threats thereof can lead to unacceptable consequences. Besides,\nstudying model adversarial vulnerability can lead to a better understanding of\nthe underlying models. Our research aims to address the two limitations of\nDNNs.

The canonical\nparallel biconnectivity algorithm is the Tarjan-Vishkin algorithm, which has\n$O(n+m)$ optimal work (number of operations) and polylogarithmic span (longest\ndependent operations) on a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. However,\nTarjan-Vishkin is not widely used in practice. We believe the reason is the\nspace-inefficiency (it generates an auxiliary graph with $O(m)$ edges). In\npractice, existing parallel implementations are based on breath-first search\n(BFS). Since BFS has span proportional to the diameter of the graph, existing\nparallel BCC implementations suffer from poor performance on large-diameter\ngraphs and can be even slower than the sequential algorithm on many real-world\ngraphs.\nWe propose the first parallel biconnectivity algorithm (FAST-BCC) that has\noptimal work, polylogarithmic span, and is space-efficient.

    "abstract": "We study the one-sided allocation problem with multi-unit demand agents. The\nspecial case of the one-sided matching problem with unit demand agents has been\nstudied extensively. The primary focus has been on the folklore Random Priority\nmechanism and the Probabilistic Serial mechanism, introduced by Bogomolnaia and\nMoulin, with emphasis on structural properties, incentives, and performance\nwith respect to social welfare. Under the standard assumption of unit-sum\nvaluation functions, Christodoulou et al. proved that the price of anarchy is\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$ in the one-sided matching problem for both the Random\nPriority and Probabilistic Serial mechanisms. Whilst both Random Priority and\nProbabilistic Serial are ordinal mechanisms, these approximation guarantees are\nthe best possible even for the broader class of cardinal mechanisms. To extend\nthese results to the general setting of one-sided allocation problems with\nmulti-unit demand agents, we consider a natural cardinal mechanism variant of\nProbabilistic Serial, which we call Cardinal Probabilistic Serial. We present\nstructural theorems for this mechanism and use them to show that Cardinal\nProbabilistic Serial has a price of anarchy of $O(\\sqrt{n}\\cdot \\log n)$ for\nthe one-sided allocation problem with multi-unit demand agents.

However, in\nmany tasks the agent might have access to offline data from related tasks in\nthe same target environment. While offline data is increasingly being used to\naid policy optimization via offline RL, our observation is that it can be a\nsurprisingly rich source of information for preference learning as well. We\npropose an approach that uses an offline dataset to craft preference queries\nvia pool-based active learning, learns a distribution over reward functions,\nand optimizes a corresponding policy via offline RL. Crucially, our proposed\napproach does not require actual physical rollouts or an accurate simulator for\neither the reward learning or policy optimization steps. To test our approach,\nwe first evaluate existing offline RL benchmarks for their suitability for\noffline reward learning. Surprisingly, for many offline RL domains, we find\nthat simply using a trivial reward function results good policy performance,\nmaking these domains ill-suited for evaluating learned rewards. To address\nthis, we identify a subset of existing offline RL benchmarks that are well\nsuited for offline reward learning and also propose new offline apprenticeship\nlearning benchmarks which allow for more open-ended behaviors. When evaluated\non this curated set of domains, our empirical results suggest that combining\noffline RL with learned human preferences can enable an agent to learn to\nperform novel tasks that were not explicitly shown in the offline data.",

However, the cost and trajectory of each agent may be unavailable to the\nother agents. Prior work on using partial observations to infer the costs in\ndynamic games assumes an open-loop information pattern. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that the feedback Nash equilibrium concept is more expressive and\nencodes more complex behavior. It is desirable to develop specific tools for\ninferring players' objectives in feedback games. Therefore, we consider the\ndynamic game cost inference problem under the feedback information pattern,\nusing only partial state observations and incomplete trajectory data. To this\nend, we first propose an inverse feedback game loss function, whose minimizer\nyields a feedback Nash equilibrium state trajectory closest to the observation\ndata. We characterize the landscape and differentiability of the loss function.\nGiven the difficulty of obtaining the exact gradient, our main contribution is\nan efficient gradient approximator, which enables a novel inverse feedback game\nsolver that minimizes the loss using first-order optimization.

    "abstract": "Recent years, graph contrastive learning (GCL), which aims to learn\nrepresentations from unlabeled graphs, has made great progress. However, the\nexisting GCL methods mostly adopt human-designed graph augmentations, which are\nsensitive to various graph datasets. In addition, the contrastive losses\noriginally developed in computer vision have been directly applied to graph\ndata, where the neighboring nodes are regarded as negatives and consequently\npushed far apart from the anchor. However, this is contradictory with the\nhomophily assumption of networks that connected nodes often belong to the same\nclass and should be close to each other. In this work, we propose an end-to-end\nautomatic GCL method, named NCLA to apply neighbor contrastive learning on\nlearnable graph augmentation. Several graph augmented views with adaptive\ntopology are automatically learned by the multi-head graph attention mechanism,\nwhich can be compatible with various graph datasets without prior domain\nknowledge. In addition, a neighbor contrastive loss is devised to allow\nmultiple positives per anchor by taking network topology as the supervised\nsignals. Both augmentations and embeddings are learned end-to-end in the\nproposed NCLA. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nNCLA yields the state-of-the-art node classification performance on\nself-supervised GCL and even exceeds the supervised ones, when the labels are\nextremely limited.

    "abstract": "Learning from noisy labels plays an important role in the deep learning era.\nDespite numerous studies with promising results, identifying clean labels from\na noisily-annotated dataset is still challenging since the conventional noisy\nlabel learning problem with single noisy label per instance is not\nidentifiable, i.e., it does not theoretically have a unique solution unless one\nhas access to clean labels or introduces additional assumptions. This paper\naims to formally investigate such identifiability issue by formulating the\nnoisy label learning problem as a multinomial mixture model, enabling the\nformulation of the identifiability constraint. In particular, we prove that the\nnoisy label learning problem is identifiable if there are at least $2C - 1$\nnoisy labels per instance provided, with $C$ being the number of classes. In\nlight of such requirement, we propose a method that automatically generates\nadditional noisy labels per training sample by estimating the noisy label\ndistribution based on nearest neighbours. Such additional noisy labels allow us\nto apply the Expectation - Maximisation algorithm to estimate the posterior of\nclean labels. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method is not only\ncapable of estimating clean labels without any heuristics in several\nchallenging label noise benchmarks, including synthetic, web-controlled and\nreal-world label noises, but also of performing competitively with many\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale capture of human motion with diverse, complex scenes, while\nimmensely useful, is often considered prohibitively costly. Meanwhile, human\nmotion alone contains rich information about the scene they reside in and\ninteract with. For example, a sitting human suggests the existence of a chair,\nand their leg position further implies the chair's pose. In this paper, we\npropose to synthesize diverse, semantically reasonable, and physically\nplausible scenes based on human motion. Our framework, Scene Synthesis from\nHUMan MotiON (SUMMON), includes two steps. It first uses ContactFormer, our\nnewly introduced contact predictor, to obtain temporally consistent contact\nlabels from human motion. Based on these predictions, SUMMON then chooses\ninteracting objects and optimizes physical plausibility losses; it further\npopulates the scene with objects that do not interact with humans. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that SUMMON synthesizes feasible, plausible, and diverse\nscenes and has the potential to generate extensive human-scene interaction data\nfor the community.",

In this paper, we consider the case where the recorded states\nand inputs are not sufficiently rich, and present a system identification\nframework -- inspired by multi-task learning -- that estimates the matrices of\na given number of LTI systems jointly, by leveraging structural similarities\nacross the LTI systems. By regularizing the LS fit for each system with a\nfunction that enforces common structural properties, the proposed method\nalleviates the ill-conditioning of the LS when the recorded trajectories are\nnot sufficiently rich. We consider priors where, for example, the LTI systems\nare similar in the sense that the system matrices share a common sparsity\npattern, some matrices are linear combinations of others, or their norm\ndifference is small. We outline a proximal-gradient method to solve the\nmulti-task identification problem, and we propose a decentralized algorithm in\nthe spirit of existing federated learning architectures. We provide empirical\nevidence of the effectiveness of the proposed method by considering a synthetic\ndataset, and by applying our method to the problem of estimating the dynamics\nof brain networks.

Considering the low efficiency and high energy\nconsumption in robot motion, we proposed combining robotic in-hand observation\nand data synthesis to enlarge the limited data set collected by the robot. We\nfirst used a robot with a depth sensor to collect images of objects held in the\nrobot's hands and segment the object pictures.

The results\nshowed that combined observation and synthetic images led to comparable\nperformance to manual data preparation. They provided a good guide on\noptimizing data configurations and parameter settings for training detectors.\nThe proposed method required only a single process and was a low-cost way to\nproduce the combined data.

    "abstract": "Building coverage statistics provide crucial insights into the urbanization,\ninfrastructure, and poverty level of a region, facilitating efforts towards\nalleviating poverty, building sustainable cities, and allocating infrastructure\ninvestments and public service provision. Global mapping of buildings has been\nmade more efficient with the incorporation of deep learning models into the\npipeline. However, these models typically rely on high-resolution satellite\nimagery which are expensive to collect and infrequently updated. As a result,\nbuilding coverage data are not updated timely especially in developing regions\nwhere the built environment is changing quickly. In this paper, we propose a\nmethod for estimating building coverage using only publicly available\nlow-resolution satellite imagery that is more frequently updated. We show that\nhaving a multi-node quantile regression layer greatly improves the model's\nspatial and temporal generalization. Our model achieves a coefficient of\ndetermination ($R^2$) as high as 0.968 on predicting building coverage in\nregions of different levels of development around the world.

As\ntechnology is developed, so do also the risks and threats associated with it,\nespecially in the forthcoming quantum era. Existing IoT networks, however, lack\na quantum-resistant secret key sharing scheme to meet confidential message\ntransmission demands in wide-area mobile applications. To address this issue,\nthis article proposes a new scheme, channel reciprocity (CR) based quantum key\ndistribution (QKD) CR-QKD, which accomplishes the goal of secret key sharing by\ncombining emerging techniques of QKD and CR-based key generation (CRKG).\nExploiting laws of quantum physics and properties of wireless channels, the\nproposed scheme is able to ensure the secrecy of the key, even against\ncomputationally unbounded adversaries. The basic mechanism is elaborated for a\nsingle-user case and it is extended into a multi-user case by redesigning a\nmulti-user edge forwarding strategy. In addition, to make CR-QKD more\npractical, some enhancement strategies are studied to reduce the time delay and\nto improve the secret key generation rate in a secure manner. A prototype of\nCR-QKD is demonstrated in a metropolitan area network, where secret keys are\nshared between two remote IoT devices that are roughly fifteen kilometers apart\nfrom each other. The experimental results have verified that CR-QKD allows a\nsecret key rate of 424 bits per second with a retransmission rate of 2.1%.",

    "abstract": "Modeling social interactions and their impact on opinion dynamics has\nattracted growing interest in recent decades, fuelled by the mounting\npopularity of online social networks (OSNs). On online social platforms, a few\nindividuals, commonly referred to as \\textit{influencers}, produce the majority\nof content consumed by users. However, classic opinion models do not capture\nthis communication asymmetry in OSNs. We develop an opinion model inspired by\nobservations on leading social media platforms and tailored to the\npeculiarities of online interactions. Our work has two main objectives: first,\nto describe the inherent communication asymmetry in OSNs, where a tiny group of\n\\textit{influencers} hegemonizes the landscape of social debate, and second, to\nmodel the personalization of content by the social media platform. We derive a\nFokker-Planck equation for the temporal evolution of users' opinion\ndistribution and analytically characterize the stationary system behavior.\nAnalytical results, confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations, show how content\npersonalization tends to radicalize user opinion and favor structurally\nadvantaged influencers. These emerging behaviors suggest that algorithmic bias,\ninherently associated with platform filtering, can lead to undesirable\noutcomes. As an example application, we apply our model to Facebook during the\nItalian government crisis in the summer of 2019. Our work provides a flexible\nframework to assess the impact of algorithmic filtering on the opinion\nformation process and a fine-grained tool to study the complex interaction\nbetween influencers and social network users.",

Concretely, we enforce the column space orthogonality by\nkeeping target information on the complement of a low-rank sensitive space.\nFurthermore, in the row space, we encourage feature dimensions between target\nand sensitive representations to be orthogonal. The effectiveness of the\nproposed method is demonstrated with extensive experiments on the CheXpert\ndataset.

    "abstract": "Visual tracker includes network and post-processing. Despite the color\ndistortion and low contrast of underwater images, advanced trackers can still\nbe very competitive in underwater object tracking because deep learning\nempowers the networks to discriminate the appearance features of the target.\nHowever, underwater object tracking also faces another problem. Underwater\ntargets such as fish and dolphins, usually appear in groups, and creatures of\nthe same species usually have similar expressions of appearance features, so it\nis challenging to distinguish the weak differences characteristics only by the\nnetwork itself. The existing detection-based post-processing only reflects the\nresults of single frame detection, but cannot locate real targets among similar\ntargets. In this paper, we propose a new post-processing strategy based on\nmotion, which uses Kalman filter (KF) to maintain the motion information of the\ntarget and exclude similar targets around. Specifically, we use the KF\npredicted box and the candidate boxes in the response map and their confidence\nto calculate the candidate location score to find the real target. Our method\ndoes not change the network structure, nor does it perform additional training\nfor the tracker. It can be quickly applied to other tracking fields with\nsimilar target problem. We improved SOTA trackers based on our method, and\nproved the effectiveness of our method on UOT100 and UTB180. The AUC of our\nmethod for OSTrack on similar subsequences is improved by more than 3% on\naverage, and the precision and normalization precision are improved by more\nthan 3.5% on average.

Random\ndown-sampled lexicase selection evaluates individuals on only a random subset\nof the training cases allowing for more individuals to be explored with the\nsame amount of program executions. However, creating a down-sample randomly\nmight exclude important cases from the current down-sample for a number of\ngenerations, while cases that measure the same behavior (synonymous cases) may\nbe overused despite their redundancy. In this work, we introduce Informed\nDown-Sampled Lexicase Selection.

Through an empirical investigation across two different GP\nsystems (PushGP and Grammar-Guided GP), we find that informed down-sampling\nsignificantly outperforms random down-sampling on a set of contemporary program\nsynthesis benchmark problems. Through an analysis of the created down-samples,\nwe find that important training cases are included in the down-sample\nconsistently across independent evolutionary runs and systems.

However, such\nreputation is hard to build and easy to destroy for all kind of business\ncommercial activities (B2C, B2B, B2B2C, B2G). A misunderstanding during the\ncommunication process to the customers, or just a bad communication strategy,\ncan lead to a disaster for the entire company. This is emphasised by the\nreaction of millions of people on social networks, which can be very\ndetrimental for the corporate image if they react negatively to a certain\nevent. This is called a firestorm.\nIn this paper, I propose a well-organised strategy for firestorm attacks on\norganisations, also showing how an adversary can leverage them to obtain\nprivate information on the attacked firm. Standard business security procedures\nare not designed to operate against multi-domain attacks; therefore, I will\nshow how it is possible to bypass the classic and advised security procedures\nby operating different kinds of attack. I also propose a different firestorm\nattack, targeting a specific business company network in an efficient way.\nFinally, I present defensive procedures to reduce the negative effect of\nfirestorms on a company.",

    "abstract": "Counterfactual explanations are an emerging tool to enhance interpretability\nof deep learning models. Given a sample, these methods seek to find and display\nto the user similar samples across the decision boundary. In this paper, we\npropose a generative adversarial counterfactual approach for satellite image\ntime series in a multi-class setting for the land cover classification task.\nOne of the distinctive features of the proposed approach is the lack of prior\nassumption on the targeted class for a given counterfactual explanation. This\ninherent flexibility allows for the discovery of interesting information on the\nrelationship between land cover classes. The other feature consists of\nencouraging the counterfactual to differ from the original sample only in a\nsmall and compact temporal segment. These time-contiguous perturbations allow\nfor a much sparser and, thus, interpretable solution. Furthermore,\nplausibility/realism of the generated counterfactual explanations is enforced\nvia the proposed adversarial learning strategy.",

    "abstract": "Controllers for dynamical systems that operate in safety-critical settings\nmust account for stochastic disturbances. Such disturbances are often modeled\nas process noise in a dynamical system, and common assumptions are that the\nunderlying distributions are known and/or Gaussian. In practice, however, these\nassumptions may be unrealistic and can lead to poor approximations of the true\nnoise distribution. We present a novel controller synthesis method that does\nnot rely on any explicit representation of the noise distributions. In\nparticular, we address the problem of computing a controller that provides\nprobabilistic guarantees on safely reaching a target, while also avoiding\nunsafe regions of the state space. First, we abstract the continuous control\nsystem into a finite-state model that captures noise by probabilistic\ntransitions between discrete states. As a key contribution, we adapt tools from\nthe scenario approach to compute probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds on\nthese transition probabilities, based on a finite number of samples of the\nnoise. We capture these bounds in the transition probability intervals of a\nso-called interval Markov decision process (iMDP). This iMDP is, with a\nuser-specified confidence probability, robust against uncertainty in the\ntransition probabilities, and the tightness of the probability intervals can be\ncontrolled through the number of samples. We use state-of-the-art verification\ntechniques to provide guarantees on the iMDP and compute a controller for which\nthese guarantees carry over to the original control system. In addition, we\ndevelop a tailored computational scheme that reduces the complexity of the\nsynthesis of these guarantees on the iMDP. Benchmarks on realistic control\nsystems show the practical applicability of our method, even when the iMDP has\nhundreds of millions of transitions.",

    "abstract": "A combinatorial market consists of a set of indivisible items and a set of\nagents, where each agent has a valuation function that specifies for each\nsubset of items its value for the given agent. From an optimization point of\nview, the goal is usually to determine a pair of pricing and allocation of the\nitems that provides an efficient distribution of the resources, i.e., maximizes\nthe social welfare, or is as profitable as possible for the seller, i.e.,\nmaximizes the revenue. To overcome the weaknesses of mechanisms operating with\nstatic prices, a recent line of research has concentrated on dynamic pricing\nschemes. In this model, agents arrive in an unspecified sequential order, and\nthe prices can be updated between two agent-arrivals. Though the dynamic\nsetting is capable of maximizing social welfare in various scenarios, the\nassumption that the agents arrive one after the other eliminates the standard\nconcept of fairness.\nIn this paper, we study the existence of optimal dynamic prices under\nfairness constraints in unit-demand markets. We propose four possible notions\nof envy-freeness of different strength depending on the time period over which\nagents compare themselves to others: the entire time horizon, only the past,\nonly the future, or only the present. For social welfare maximization, while\nthe first definition leads to Walrasian equilibria, we give polynomial-time\nalgorithms that always find envy-free optimal dynamic prices in the remaining\nthree cases. In contrast, for revenue maximization, we show that the\ncorresponding problems are APX-hard if the ordering of the agents is fixed. On\nthe positive side, we give polynomial-time algorithms for the setting when the\nseller can choose the order in which agents arrive.",

Moreover, learning\non static datasets may be simply impossible in scenarios with small aggregate\nstorage across devices. It is, therefore, necessary to design federated\nalgorithms able to learn from data streams. In this work, we formulate and\nstudy the problem of \\emph{federated learning for data streams}.

    "abstract": "Causal inference plays an important role in under standing the underlying\nmechanisation of the data generation process across various domains. It is\nchallenging to estimate the average causal effect and individual causal effects\nfrom observational data with high-dimensional covariates due to the curse of\ndimension and the problem of data sufficiency. The existing matching methods\ncan not effectively estimate individual causal effect or solve the problem of\ndimension curse in causal inference. To address this challenge, in this work,\nwe prove that the reduced set by sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) is a\nbalance score for confounding adjustment. Under the theorem, we propose to use\nan SDR method to obtain a reduced representation set of the original covariates\nand then the reduced set is used for the matching method. In detail, a\nnon-parametric model is used to learn such a reduced set and to avoid model\nspecification errors. The experimental results on real-world datasets show that\nthe proposed method outperforms the compared matching methods. Moreover, we\nconduct an experiment analysis and the results demonstrate that the reduced\nrepresentation is enough to balance the imbalance between the treatment group\nand control group individuals.",

They are motivated by the pattern recognition system in\nthe human brain, where complex objects are decomposed into a hierarchy of\nsimpler object parts. Such a hierarchy is referred to as a parse-tree.\nConceptually, capsule neural networks have been defined to realize such\nparse-trees. The capsule neural network (CapsNet), by Sabour, Frosst, and\nHinton, is the first actual implementation of the conceptual idea of capsule\nneural networks.

Here, we provide a reason for\nthis failure and argue that it is most likely not possible to scale CapsNets\nbeyond toy examples. In particular, we show that the concept of a parse-tree,\nthe main idea behind capsule neuronal networks, is not present in CapsNets.

However, the present\ndiscourse on such critical issues is being shaped by the more economically\ndeveloped countries (MEDC), which raises concerns regarding neglecting local\nknowledge, cultural pluralism and global fairness. This study builds upon\nexisting research on responsible AI, with a focus on areas in the Global South\nconsidered to be under-served vis-a-vis AI. Our goal is two-fold (1) to assess\nFATE-related issues and the effectiveness of transparency methods and (2) to\nproffer useful insights and stimulate action towards bridging the accessibility\nand inclusivity gap in AI. Using ads data from online social networks, we\ndesigned a user study (n=43) to achieve the above goals. Among the findings\nfrom the study include: explanations about decisions reached by the AI systems\ntend to be vague and less informative. To bridge the accessibility and\ninclusivity gap, there is a need to engage with the community for the best way\nto integrate fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics in AI. This will\nhelp in empowering the affected community or individual to effectively probe\nand police the growing application of AI-powered systems.",

    "abstract": "With the rise of hailing services, people are increasingly relying on shared\nmobility (e.g., Uber, Lyft) drivers to pick up for transportation. However,\nsuch drivers and riders have difficulties finding each other in urban areas as\nGPS signals get blocked by skyscrapers, in crowded environments (e.g., in\nstadiums, airports, and bars), at night, and in bad weather. It wastes their\ntime, creates a bad user experience, and causes more CO2 emissions due to idle\ndriving. In this work, we explore the potential of Wi-Fi to help drivers to\ndetermine the street side of the riders. Our proposed system is called CarFi\nthat uses Wi-Fi CSI from two antennas placed inside a moving vehicle and a\ndata-driven technique to determine the street side of the rider. By collecting\nreal-world data in realistic and challenging settings by blocking the signal\nwith other people and other parked cars, we see that CarFi is 95.44% accurate\nin rider-side determination in both line of sight (LoS) and non-line of sight\n(nLoS) conditions, and can be run on an embedded GPU in real-time.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of MOOC quality evaluation which is\nessential for improving the course materials, promoting students' learning\nefficiency, and benefiting user services. While achieving promising\nperformances, current works still suffer from the complicated interactions and\nrelationships of entities in MOOC platforms. To tackle the challenges, we\nformulate the problem as a course representation learning task-based and\ndevelop an Information-aware Graph Representation Learning(IaGRL) for\nmulti-view MOOC quality evaluation. Specifically, We first build a MOOC\nHeterogeneous Network (HIN) to represent the interactions and relationships\namong entities in MOOC platforms. And then we decompose the MOOC HIN into\nmultiple single-relation graphs based on meta-paths to depict the multi-view\nsemantics of courses. The course representation learning can be further\nconverted to a multi-view graph representation task. Different from traditional\ngraph representation learning, the learned course representations are expected\nto match the following three types of validity: (1) the agreement on\nexpressiveness between the raw course portfolio and the learned course\nrepresentations; (2) the consistency between the representations in each view\nand the unified representations; (3) the alignment between the course and MOOC\nplatform representations. Therefore, we propose to exploit mutual information\nfor preserving the validity of course representations. We conduct extensive\nexperiments over real-world MOOC datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour proposed method.",

    "abstract": "The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than six million deaths\nworldwide. Medicalized hotels were established in Taiwan as quarantine\nfacilities for COVID-19 patients with no or mild symptoms. Due to limited\nmedical care available at these hotels, it is of paramount importance to\nidentify patients at risk of clinical deterioration. This study aimed to\ndevelop and evaluate a graph-based deep learning approach for progressive\nhospital transfer risk prediction in a medicalized hotel setting. Vital sign\nmeasurements were obtained for 632 patients and daily patient similarity graphs\nwere constructed. Inductive graph convolutional network models were trained on\ntop of the temporally integrated graphs to predict hospital transfer risk. The\nproposed models achieved AUC scores above 0.83 for hospital transfer risk\nprediction based on the measurements of past 1, 2, and 3 days, outperforming\nbaseline machine learning methods. A post-hoc analysis on the constructed\ndiffusion-based graph using Local Clustering Coefficient discovered a high-risk\ncluster with significantly older mean age, higher body temperature, lower SpO2,\nand shorter length of stay. Further time-to-hospital-transfer survival analysis\nalso revealed a significant decrease in survival probability in the discovered\nhigh-risk cluster. The obtained results demonstrated promising predictability\nand interpretability of the proposed graph-based approach.

Global warming, climate change and a range of other impacts\ncaused by humans, such as carbon emissions, sociopolitical and economical\nchallenges (e.g. war), traditional workforce/labour decline and population\ngrowth are straining global food security. The need for high-speed and reliable\nwireless communication in agriculture is becoming more of a necessity rather\nthan a technological demonstration or showing superiority in the field.\nGovernments and industries around the world are seeing more urgency in\nestablishing communication infrastructure to scale up agricultural activities\nand improve sustainability, by employing autonomous agri-robotics and\nagri-technologies. The work presented here evaluates the physical performance\nof 5G in an agri-robotics application, and the results are compared against 4G\nand WiFi6 (a newly emerging wireless communication standard), which are\ntypically used in agricultural environments. In addition, a series of\nsimulation experiments were performed to assess the ``real-time'' operational\ndelay in critical tasks that may require a human-in-the-loop to support\ndecision making. The results lead to the conclusion that 4G cannot be used in\nthe agricultural domain for applications that require high throughput and\nreliable communication between robot and user. Moreover, a single wireless\nsolution does not exist for the agricultural domain, but instead multiple\nsolutions can be combined to meet the necessary telecommunications\nrequirements. Finally, the results show that 5G greatly outperforms 4G in all\nperformance metrics, and on average only 18.2ms slower than WiFi6 making it\nvery reliable.",

In XGD, instead of empirically adopting a threshold to\nselect the high-quality teacher predictions as soft targets, we decompose the\npredicted 3D box into sub-components and retain the corresponding part for\ndistillation if the teacher component pilot is consistent with ground truth to\nlargely boost the number of positive predictions and alleviate the mimicking\ndifficulty of the student model.

Comprehensive experiments on various existing benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the SPTS v2 can outperform previous state-of-the-art single-point\ntext spotters with fewer parameters while achieving 14x faster inference speed.\nMost importantly, within the scope of our SPTS v2, extensive experiments\nfurther reveal an important phenomenon that single-point serves as the optimal\nsetting for the scene text spotting compared to non-point, rectangular bounding\nbox, and polygonal bounding box. Such an attempt provides a significant\nopportunity for scene text spotting applications beyond the realms of existing\nparadigms. Code is available at https://github.com/shannanyinxiang/SPTS.",

    "abstract": "State uncertainty poses a major challenge for decentralized coordination,\nwhere multiple agents act according to noisy observations without any access to\nother agents' information. Centralized training for decentralized execution\n(CTDE) is a multi-agent reinforcement learning paradigm, which exploits global\ninformation to learn a centralized value function in order to derive\ncoordinated multi-agent policies. State-based CTDE has become popular in\nmulti-agent research due to remarkable progress in the StarCraft Multi-Agent\nChallenge (SMAC). However, SMAC scenarios are less suited for evaluation\nagainst state uncertainty due to deterministic observations and low variance in\ninitial states. Furthermore, state-based CTDE largely neglects state\nuncertainty w.r.t. decentralization of agents and observations thus being\npossibly less effective in more general settings. In this paper, we address\nstate uncertainty and introduce MessySMAC, a modified version of SMAC with\nstochastic observations and higher variance in initial states to provide a more\ngeneral and configurable benchmark. We then propose Attention-based Embeddings\nof Recurrency In multi-Agent Learning (AERIAL) to approximate value functions\nunder consideration of state uncertainty. AERIAL replaces the true state in\nCTDE with the memory representation of all agents' recurrent functions, which\nare processed by a self-attention mechanism. We evaluate AERIAL in Dec-Tiger as\nwell as in a variety of SMAC and MessySMAC maps, and compare the results with\nstate-based CTDE. We also evaluate the robustness of AERIAL and state-based\nCTDE against various configurations of state uncertainty in MessySMAC.",

    "abstract": "The wide-angle lens shows appealing applications in VR technologies, but it\nintroduces severe radial distortion into its captured image. To recover the\nrealistic scene, previous works devote to rectifying the content of the\nwide-angle image. However, such a rectification solution inevitably distorts\nthe image boundary, which potentially changes related geometric distributions\nand misleads the current vision perception models. In this work, we explore\nconstructing a win-win representation on both content and boundary by\ncontributing a new learning model, i.e., Rectangling Rectification Network\n(RecRecNet). In particular, we propose a thin-plate spline (TPS) module to\nformulate the non-linear and non-rigid transformation for rectangling images.\nBy learning the control points on the rectified image, our model can flexibly\nwarp the source structure to the target domain and achieves an end-to-end\nunsupervised deformation. To relieve the complexity of structure approximation,\nwe then inspire our RecRecNet to learn the gradual deformation rules with a DoF\n(Degree of Freedom)-based curriculum learning. By increasing the DoF in each\ncurriculum stage, namely, from similarity transformation (4-DoF) to homography\ntransformation (8-DoF), the network is capable of investigating more detailed\ndeformations, offering fast convergence on the final rectangling task.\nExperiments show the superiority of our solution over the compared methods on\nboth quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

    "abstract": "At the dawn of the next-generation wireless systems and networks, massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has been envisioned as one of the\nenabling technologies. With the continued success of being applied in the 5G\nand beyond, the massive MIMO technology has demonstrated its advantageousness,\nintegrability, and extendibility. Moreover, several evolutionary features and\nrevolutionizing trends for massive MIMO have gradually emerged in recent years,\nwhich are expected to reshape the future 6G wireless systems and networks.\nSpecifically, the functions and performance of future massive MIMO systems will\nbe enabled and enhanced via combining other innovative technologies,\narchitectures, and strategies such as intelligent omni-surfaces\n(IOSs)/intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), artificial intelligence (AI),\nTHz communications, cell free architecture. Also, more diverse vertical\napplications based on massive MIMO will emerge and prosper, such as wireless\nlocalization and sensing, vehicular communications, non-terrestrial\ncommunications, remote sensing, inter-planetary communications.",

    "title": "Error Tolerant Multi-Robot System for Roadside Trash Collection",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the first iteration of an error-tolerant,\nautonomous, multi-robot system that monitors highway road verges and identifies\nand collects roadside litter. It is designed to use an aerial vehicle that can\nrapidly cover a vast area and collect data on the road verge. This data is then\npassed to a ground vehicle that constructs a map of the road verge and uses a\ntrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify pieces of litter. After\nthe pieces of litter are identified on the map of the road verge, the ground\nrobot navigates to each piece of trash, re-evaluates the area, and performs a\n\"greedy pickup\" procedure. This final stage accounts for any error in the map's\nconstruction or the identified trash's location. We found that ending the\nrobotic system's control flow with a greedy pickup procedure can retroactively\naccount for processing errors of the system as it runs. This increases the\nsystem's fault tolerance and allows for the use of cheaper equipment since\npinpoint accuracy is not always necessary. In this paper, we present the\nfeasibility of this system by testing in simulation and later using real\nrobotic hardware. We show that the system is effective enough to iterate on its\ndesign principles to create a more sophisticated system.",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of reduced-order models (ROMs) first obtain a low\ndimensional representation of the problem from high-dimensional model (HDM)\ntraining data which is afterwards used to obtain a system of reduced\ncomplexity. Unfortunately, convection-dominated problems generally have a\nslowly decaying Kolmogorov n-width, which makes obtaining an accurate ROM built\nsolely from training data very challenging. The accuracy of a ROM can be\nimproved through enrichment with HDM solutions; however, due to the large\ncomputational expense of HDM evaluations for complex problems, they can only be\nused parsimoniously to obtain relevant computational savings. In this work, we\nexploit the local spatial and temporal coherence often exhibited by these\nproblems to derive an accurate, cost-efficient approach that repeatedly\ncombines HDM and ROM evaluations without a separate training phase. Our\napproach obtains solutions at a given time step by either fully solving the HDM\nor by combining partial HDM and ROM solves. A dynamic sampling procedure\nidentifies regions that require the HDM solution for global accuracy and the\nreminder of the flow is reconstructed using the ROM. Moreover, solutions\ncombining both HDM and ROM solves use spatial filtering to eliminate potential\nspurious oscillations that may develop. We test the proposed method on inviscid\ncompressible flow problems and demonstrate speedups up to an order of\nmagnitude.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a class of effective deep learning models\nfor node classification tasks; yet their predictive capability may be severely\ncompromised under adversarially designed unnoticeable perturbations to the\ngraph structure and/or node data. Most of the current work on graph adversarial\nattacks aims at lowering the overall prediction accuracy, but we argue that the\nresulting abnormal model performance may catch attention easily and invite\nquick counterattack. Moreover, attacks through modification of existing graph\ndata may be hard to conduct if good security protocols are implemented. In this\nwork, we consider an easier attack harder to be noticed, through adversarially\npatching the graph with new nodes and edges. The attack is universal: it\ntargets a single node each time and flips its connection to the same set of\npatch nodes. The attack is unnoticeable: it does not modify the predictions of\nnodes other than the target. We develop an algorithm, named GUAP, that achieves\nhigh attack success rate but meanwhile preserves the prediction accuracy. GUAP\nis fast to train by employing a sampling strategy. We demonstrate that a 5%\nsampling in each epoch yields 20x speedup in training, with only a slight\ndegradation in attack performance. Additionally, we show that the adversarial\npatch trained with the graph convolutional network transfers well to other\nGNNs, such as the graph attention network.",

However, many DP algorithms have to fill in large DP tables,\nrepresented by two-dimensional arrays, which causes at least quadratic running\ntimes and space usages. This has led to the development of improved algorithms\nfor special cases when the DPs satisfy additional properties like, e.g., the\nMonge property or total monotonicity.\nIn this paper, we consider a new condition which assumes (among some other\ntechnical assumptions) that the rows of the DP table are monotone. Under this\nassumption, we introduce a novel data structure for computing\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate DP solutions in near-linear time and space in the\nstatic setting, and with polylogarithmic update times when the DP entries\nchange dynamically. To the best of our knowledge, our new condition is\nincomparable to previous conditions and is the first which allows to derive\ndynamic algorithms based on existing DPs. Instead of using two-dimensional\narrays to store the DP tables, we store the rows of the DP tables using\nmonotone piecewise constant functions. This allows us to store length-$n$ DP\ntable rows with entries in $[0,W]$ using only polylog$(n,W)$ bits, and to\nperform operations, such as $(\\min,+)$-convolution or rounding, on these\nfunctions in polylogarithmic time.\nWe further present several applications of our data structure. For bicriteria\nversions of $k$-balanced graph partitioning and simultaneous source location,\nwe obtain the first dynamic algorithms with subpolynomial update times, as well\nas the first static algorithms using only near-linear time and space.\nAdditionally, we obtain the currently fastest algorithm for fully dynamic\nknapsack.",

The\nHermite-Taylor method evolves the electromagnetic fields and their derivatives\nthrough order $m$ in each Cartesian coordinate. This makes the development of a\nsystematic approach to enforce boundary and interface conditions difficult.\nHere we use the correction function method to update the numerical solution\nwhere the Hermite-Taylor method cannot be applied directly. The proposed\nhigh-order method offers a flexible systematic approach to handle embedded\nboundary and interface problems, including problems with discontinuous\nsolutions at the interface. This method is also easily adaptable to other first\norder hyperbolic systems.",

    "abstract": "The Yee algorithm for electromagnetic simulations is widely known to have\nmany advantages, including the following crucial two: (i) Its calculations are\nlocal and therefore efficiently parallelizable--enabling simulations that\ncapitalize on the speed and scalability of high-performance computing\narchitecture. (ii) Yee's method faithfully preserves the symplectic geometry of\nMaxwell's equations, improving its accuracy in long-time numerical simulations.\nWhereas previous geometric generalizations of Yee's method have sacrificed its\nscalability, in this article the Yee algorithm is generalized to higher order\nand unstructured meshes in a manner that fully preserves both its scalability\nand geometric naturalness. This generalization is achieved by prioritizing the\nlocality of the algorithm, reflecting the physical locality of Maxwell's\nequations. Specifically, we demonstrate that Yee's method is but a special case\nof a larger family of symplectic, finite element exterior calculus (FEEC)\nmethods that use scalable, local approximations of mass matrices. We discuss\nthe numerical advantages of this family of methods, which we call scalable FEEC\n(SFEEC) methods.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, the use of autonomous drone systems for surveying,\nsearch and rescue, or last-mile delivery has increased exponentially. With the\nrise of these applications comes the need for highly robust, safety-critical\nalgorithms which can operate drones in complex and uncertain environments.\nAdditionally, flying fast enables drones to cover more ground which in turn\nincreases productivity and further strengthens their use case. One proxy for\ndeveloping algorithms used in high-speed navigation is the task of autonomous\ndrone racing, where researchers program drones to fly through a sequence of\ngates and avoid obstacles as quickly as possible using onboard sensors and\nlimited computational power. Speeds and accelerations exceed over 80 kph and 4\ng respectively, raising significant challenges across perception, planning,\ncontrol, and state estimation. To achieve maximum performance, systems require\nreal-time algorithms that are robust to motion blur, high dynamic range, model\nuncertainties, aerodynamic disturbances, and often unpredictable opponents.\nThis survey covers the progression of autonomous drone racing across\nmodel-based and learning-based approaches. We provide an overview of the field,\nits evolution over the years, and conclude with the biggest challenges and open\nquestions to be faced in the future.",

Alternatively using ordinary\ndevices, patients ought to log data into a mobile health-monitoring manually.\nIt causes several issues: (1) clients reportedly tend to enter unrealistic\ndata; (2) typing values several times a day is bothersome and causes clients to\nleave the mobile app. Thus, there is a strong need to use now-ubiquitous\nsmartphones, reducing error by capturing images from the screen of medical\ndevices and extracting useful information automatically. Nevertheless, there\nare a few challenges in its development: (1) data scarcity has led to\nimpractical methods with very low accuracy: to our knowledge, only small\ndatasets are available in this case; (2) accuracy-availability tradeoff: one\ncan execute a less accurate algorithm on a mobile phone to maintain higher\navailability, or alternatively deploy a more accurate and more\ncompute-intensive algorithm on the cloud, however, at the cost of lower\navailability in poor/no connectivity situations. We present an ensemble\nlearning algorithm, a mobile-cloud computing service architecture, and a simple\ncompression technique to achieve higher availability and faster response time\nwhile providing higher accuracy by integrating cloud- and mobile-side\npredictions.

    "abstract": "Side information is being used extensively to improve the effectiveness of\nsequential recommendation models. It is said to help capture the transition\npatterns among items. Most previous work on sequential recommendation that uses\nside information models item IDs and side information separately. This can only\nmodel part of relations between items and their side information. Moreover, in\nreal-world systems, not all values of item feature fields are available. This\nhurts the performance of models that rely on side information. Existing methods\ntend to neglect the context of missing item feature fields, and fill them with\ngeneric or special values, e.g., unknown, which might lead to sub-optimal\nperformance. To address the limitation of sequential recommenders with side\ninformation, we define a way to fuse side information and alleviate the problem\nof missing side information by proposing a unified task, namely the missing\ninformation imputation (MII), which randomly masks some feature fields in a\ngiven sequence of items, including item IDs, and then forces a predictive model\nto recover them. By considering the next item as a missing feature field,\nsequential recommendation can be formulated as a special case of MII. We\npropose a sequential recommendation model, called missing information\nimputation recommender (MIIR), that builds on the idea of MII and\nsimultaneously imputes missing item feature values and predicts the next item.\nWe devise a dense fusion self-attention (DFSA) for MIIR to capture all pairwise\nrelations between items and their side information. Empirical studies on three\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that MIIR, supervised by MII, achieves a\nsignificantly better sequential recommendation performance than\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

Our work is\nmotivated by the application of clustering individuals according to their\npopulation of origin using markers, when the divergence between the two\npopulations is small. We are interested in the case that individual features\nare of low average quality $\\gamma$, and we want to use as few of them as\npossible to correctly partition the sample. We consider semidefinite relaxation\nof an integer quadratic program which is formulated essentially as finding the\nmaximum cut on a graph where edge weights in the cut represent dissimilarity\nscores between two nodes based on their features. A small simulation result in\nBlum, Coja-Oghlan, Frieze and Zhou (2007, 2009) shows that even when the sample\nsize $n$ is small, by increasing $p$ so that $np= \\Omega(1/\\gamma^2)$, one can\nclassify a mixture of two product populations using the spectral method therein\nwith success rate reaching an ``oracle'' curve. There the ``oracle'' was\ncomputed assuming that distributions were known, where success rate means the\nratio between correctly classified individuals and the sample size $n$. In this\nwork, we show the theoretical underpinning of this observed concentration of\nmeasure phenomenon in high dimensions, simultaneously for the semidefinite\noptimization goal and the spectral method, where the input is based on the gram\nmatrix computed from centered data. We allow a full range of tradeoffs between\nthe sample size and the number of features such that the product of these two\nis lower bounded by $1/{\\gamma^2}$ so long as the number of features $p$ is\nlower bounded by $1/\\gamma$.",

    "abstract": "The TESS mission produces a large amount of time series data, only a small\nfraction of which contain detectable exoplanetary transit signals. Deep\nlearning techniques such as neural networks have proved effective at\ndifferentiating promising astrophysical eclipsing candidates from other\nphenomena such as stellar variability and systematic instrumental effects in an\nefficient, unbiased and sustainable manner. This paper presents a high quality\ndataset containing light curves from the Primary Mission and 1st Extended\nMission full frame images and periodic signals detected via Box Least Squares\n(Kov\\'acs et al. 2002; Hartman 2012). The dataset was curated using a thorough\nmanual review process then used to train a neural network called\nAstronet-Triage-v2. On our test set, for transiting/eclipsing events we achieve\na 99.6% recall (true positives over all data with positive labels) at a\nprecision of 75.7% (true positives over all predicted positives). Since 90% of\nour training data is from the Primary Mission, we also test our ability to\ngeneralize on held-out 1st Extended Mission data. Here, we find an area under\nthe precision-recall curve of 0.965, a 4% improvement over Astronet-Triage (Yu\net al. 2019). On the TESS Object of Interest (TOI) Catalog through April 2022,\na shortlist of planets and planet candidates, Astronet-Triage-v2 is able to\nrecover 3577 out of 4140 TOIs, while Astronet-Triage only recovers 3349 targets\nat an equal level of precision. In other words, upgrading to Astronet-Triage-v2\nhelps save at least 200 planet candidates from being lost. The new model is\ncurrently used for planet candidate triage in the Quick-Look Pipeline (Huang et\nal. 2020a,b; Kunimoto et al. 2021).",

    "abstract": "Lymph node (LN) metastasis status is one of the most critical prognostic and\ncancer staging factors for patients with resectable pancreatic ductal\nadenocarcinoma (PDAC), or in general, for any types of solid malignant tumors.\nPreoperative prediction of LN metastasis from non-invasive CT imaging is highly\ndesired, as it might be straightforwardly used to guide the following\nneoadjuvant treatment decision and surgical planning. Most studies only capture\nthe tumor characteristics in CT imaging to implicitly infer LN metastasis and\nvery few work exploit direct LN's CT imaging information. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work to propose a fully-automated LN segmentation\nand identification network to directly facilitate the LN metastasis status\nprediction task. Nevertheless LN segmentation/detection is very challenging\nsince LN can be easily confused with other hard negative anatomic structures\n(e.g., vessels) from radiological images. We explore the anatomical spatial\ncontext priors of pancreatic LN locations by generating a guiding attention map\nfrom related organs and vessels to assist segmentation and infer LN status. As\nsuch, LN segmentation is impelled to focus on regions that are anatomically\nadjacent or plausible with respect to the specific organs and vessels. The\nmetastasized LN identification network is trained to classify the segmented LN\ninstances into positives or negatives by reusing the segmentation network as a\npre-trained backbone and padding a new classification head. More importantly,\nwe develop a LN metastasis status prediction network that combines the\npatient-wise aggregation results of LN segmentation/identification and deep\nimaging features extracted from the tumor region. Extensive quantitative nested\nfive-fold cross-validation is conducted on a discovery dataset of 749 patients\nwith PDAC.",

    "abstract": "One of the fundamental questions about quasars is related to their central\nsupermassive black holes. The reason for the existence of these black holes\nwith such a huge mass is still unclear and various models have been proposed to\nexplain them. However, there is still no comprehensive explanation that is\naccepted by the community. The only thing we are sure of is that these black\nholes were not created by the collapse of giant stars, nor by the accretion of\nmatter around them. Moreover, another important question is the mass\ndistribution of these black holes over time. Observations have shown that if we\ngo back through redshift, we see black holes with more masses, and after\npassing the peak of star formation redshift, this procedure decreases.\nNevertheless, the exact redshift of this peak is still controversial. In this\npaper, with the help of deep learning and the LSTM algorithm, we tried to find\na suitable model for the mass of central black holes of quasars over time by\nconsidering QuasarNET data. Our model was built with these data reported from\nredshift 3 to 7 and for two redshift intervals 0 to 3 and 7 to 10, it predicted\nthe mass of the quasar's central supermassive black holes. We have also tested\nour model for the specified intervals with observed data from central black\nholes and discussed the results.",

    "abstract": "Owing to recent advances in thoracic electrical impedance tomography, a\npatient's hemodynamic function can be noninvasively and continuously estimated\nin real-time by surveilling a cardiac volume signal associated with stroke\nvolume and cardiac output. In clinical applications, however, a cardiac volume\nsignal is often of low quality, mainly because of the patient's deliberate\nmovements or inevitable motions during clinical interventions. This study aims\nto develop a signal quality indexing method that assesses the influence of\nmotion artifacts on transient cardiac volume signals. The assessment is\nperformed on each cardiac cycle to take advantage of the periodicity and\nregularity in cardiac volume changes. Time intervals are identified using the\nsynchronized electrocardiography system. We apply divergent machine-learning\nmethods, which can be sorted into discriminative-model and manifold-learning\napproaches. The use of machine-learning could be suitable for our real-time\nmonitoring application that requires fast inference and automation as well as\nhigh accuracy. In the clinical environment, the proposed method can be utilized\nto provide immediate warnings so that clinicians can minimize confusion\nregarding patients' conditions, reduce clinical resource utilization, and\nimprove the confidence level of the monitoring system. Numerous experiments\nusing actual EIT data validate the capability of cardiac volume signals\ndegraded by motion artifacts to be accurately and automatically assessed in\nreal-time by machine learning.

The abnormal\noscillations in high-frequency waves associated with psychotic disorders during\nsensory and cognitive tasks have been studied many times. However, any\nsignificant dissimilarity in the resting-state low-frequency bands is yet to be\nestablished. Spectral analysis of the alpha and delta band waves shows the\neffectiveness of stimulus-independent EEG in identifying the abnormal activity\npatterns of pathological brains. A generalized model incorporating multiple\nfrequency bands should be more efficient in associating potential EEG\nbiomarkers with First-Episode Psychosis (FEP), leading to an accurate\ndiagnosis. We explore multiple machine-learning methods, including\nrandom-forest, support vector machine, and Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC),\nto demonstrate the practicality of resting-state Power Spectral Density (PSD)\nto distinguish patients of FEP from healthy controls. A comprehensive\ndiscussion of our preprocessing methods for PSD analysis and a detailed\ncomparison of different models are included in this paper. The GPC model\noutperforms the other models with a specificity of 95.78% to show that PSD can\nbe used as an effective feature extraction technique for analyzing and\nclassifying resting-state EEG signals of psychiatric disorders.",

To overcome this difficulty, this\npaper proposes a quantum feasibility labeling (QFL) algorithm to label all\npossible solutions to the vertex coloring problem, which is a well-known\nNP-complete problem. The variational quantum search (VQS) algorithm proposed in\nmy previous work has been demonstrated, up to 26 qubits, to achieve an\nexponential speedup in finding good element(s) from an unstructured database.\nUsing the labels and the associated possible solutions as input, the VQS can\nfind all feasible solutions to the vertex coloring problem. The number of\nqubits and the circuit depth required by the QFL each is a polynomial function\nof the number of vertices, the number of edges, and the number of colors of a\nvertex coloring problem.

Some QNNs with specific encoding methods can be efficiently\nsimulated by classical surrogates, while others with quantum memory may perform\nbetter than classical classifiers. Here we systematically investigate the\nproblem-dependent power of quantum neural classifiers (QCs) on multi-class\nclassification tasks. Through the analysis of expected risk, a measure that\nweighs the training loss and the generalization error of a classifier jointly,\nwe identify two key findings: first, the training loss dominates the power\nrather than the generalization ability; second, QCs undergo a U-shaped risk\ncurve, in contrast to the double-descent risk curve of deep neural classifiers.\nWe also reveal the intrinsic connection between optimal QCs and the Helstrom\nbound and the equiangular tight frame. Using these findings, we propose a\nmethod that uses loss dynamics to probe whether a QC may be more effective than\na classical classifier on a particular learning task. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to explain the superiority of QCs\nover multilayer Perceptron on parity datasets and their limitations over\nconvolutional neural networks on image datasets.

    "abstract": "There is a recent trend to leverage the power of graph neural networks (GNNs)\nfor brain-network based psychiatric diagnosis, which,in turn, also motivates an\nurgent need for psychiatrists to fully understand the decision behavior of the\nused GNNs. However, most of the existing GNN explainers are either post-hoc in\nwhich another interpretive model needs to be created to explain a well-trained\nGNN, or do not consider the causal relationship between the extracted\nexplanation and the decision, such that the explanation itself contains\nspurious correlations and suffers from weak faithfulness. In this work, we\npropose a granger causality-inspired graph neural network (CI-GNN), a built-in\ninterpretable model that is able to identify the most influential subgraph\n(i.e., functional connectivity within brain regions) that is causally related\nto the decision (e.g., major depressive disorder patients or healthy controls),\nwithout the training of an auxillary interpretive network. CI-GNN learns\ndisentangled subgraph-level representations {\\alpha} and \\b{eta} that encode,\nrespectively, the causal and noncausal aspects of original graph under a graph\nvariational autoencoder framework, regularized by a conditional mutual\ninformation (CMI) constraint. We theoretically justify the validity of the CMI\nregulation in capturing the causal relationship. We also empirically evaluate\nthe performance of CI-GNN against three baseline GNNs and four state-of-the-art\nGNN explainers on synthetic data and two large-scale brain disease datasets. We\nobserve that CI-GNN achieves the best performance in a wide range of metrics\nand provides more reliable and concise explanations which have clinical\nevidence.",

    "title": "A Barrier Method for Contact Avoiding Particles in Stokes Flow",
    "abstract": "Rigid particles in a Stokesian fluid can physically not overlap, as a thin\nlayer of fluid always separates a particle pair, exerting increasingly strong\nrepulsive forces on the bodies for decreasing separations. Numerically,\nresolving these lubrication forces comes at an intractably large cost even for\nmoderate system sizes. Hence, it can typically not be guaranteed that particle\ncollisions and overlaps do not occur in a dynamic simulation, independently of\nthe choice of method to solve the Stokes equations. In this work, non-overlap\nconstraints, in terms of the Euclidean distance between boundary points on the\nparticles, are represented via a barrier energy. We solve for the minimum\nmagnitudes of repelling contact forces between any particle pair in contact to\ncorrect for overlaps by enforcing a zero barrier energy at the next time level,\ngiven a contact-free configuration at a previous instance in time. The method\nis tested using a multiblob method to solve the mobility problem in Stokes flow\napplied to suspensions of spheres, rods and boomerang shaped particles.\nCollision free configurations are obtained at all instances in time. The effect\nof the contact forces on the collective order of a set of rods in a background\nflow that naturally promote particle interactions is also illustrated.",

    "abstract": "As the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to impact many aspects\nof life and the global healthcare systems, the adoption of rapid and effective\nscreening methods to prevent further spread of the virus and lessen the burden\non healthcare providers is a necessity. As a cheap and widely accessible\nmedical image modality, point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) imaging allows\nradiologists to identify symptoms and assess severity through visual inspection\nof the chest ultrasound images. Combined with the recent advancements in\ncomputer science, applications of deep learning techniques in medical image\nanalysis have shown promising results, demonstrating that artificial\nintelligence-based solutions can accelerate the diagnosis of COVID-19 and lower\nthe burden on healthcare professionals. However, the lack of a huge amount of\nwell-annotated data poses a challenge in building effective deep neural\nnetworks in the case of novel diseases and pandemics. Motivated by this, we\npresent COVID-Net USPro, an explainable few-shot deep prototypical network,\nthat monitors and detects COVID-19 positive cases with high precision and\nrecall from minimal ultrasound images. COVID-Net USPro achieves 99.65% overall\naccuracy, 99.7% recall and 99.67% precision for COVID-19 positive cases when\ntrained with only 5 shots. The analytic pipeline and results were verified by\nour contributing clinician with extensive experience in POCUS interpretation,\nensuring that the network makes decisions based on actual patterns.",

    "abstract": "Motion artifact reduction is one of the most concerned problems in magnetic\nresonance imaging. As a promising solution, deep learning-based methods have\nbeen widely investigated for artifact reduction tasks in MRI. As a\nretrospective processing method, neural network does not cost additional\nacquisition time or require new acquisition equipment, and seems to work better\nthan traditional artifact reduction methods. In the previous study, training\nsuch models require the paired motion-corrupted and motion-free MR images.\nHowever, it is extremely tough or even impossible to obtain these images in\nreality because patients have difficulty in maintaining the same state during\ntwo image acquisition, which makes the training in a supervised manner\nimpractical. In this work, we proposed a new unsupervised abnomality extraction\nnetwork (UNAEN) to alleviate this problem. Our network realizes the transition\nfrom artifact domain to motion-free domain by processing the abnormal\ninformation introduced by artifact in unpaired MR images. Different from\ndirectly generating artifact reduction results from motion-corrupted MR images,\nwe adopted the strategy of abnomality extraction to indirectly correct the\nimpact of artifact in MR images by learning the deep features. Experimental\nresults show that our method is superior to state-of-the-art networks and can\npotentially be applied in real clinical settings.",

Our method is\nbased on gradient descent over the space of probability measures equipped with\nthe Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao geometry for which we establish convergence\nguarantees. In practice, it can be approximated using an interacting particle\nsystem where the weight and location of particles are updated alternately. We\nconduct extensive numerical experiments to confirm the effectiveness of the\nproposed algorithm compared not only to classical benchmarks but also to\nsimilar gradient descent algorithms with respect to simpler geometries.
