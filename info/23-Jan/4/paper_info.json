    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) has achieved automatic and objective assessment of\nsurgical skills. However, DL models are data-hungry and restricted to their\ntraining domain. This prevents them from transitioning to new tasks where data\nis limited. Hence, domain adaptation is crucial to implement DL in real life.\nHere, we propose a meta-learning model, A-VBANet, that can deliver\ndomain-agnostic surgical skill classification via one-shot learning. We develop\nthe A-VBANet on five laparoscopic and robotic surgical simulators.\nAdditionally, we test it on operating room (OR) videos of laparoscopic\ncholecystectomy. Our model successfully adapts with accuracies up to 99.5% in\none-shot and 99.9% in few-shot settings for simulated tasks and 89.7% for\nlaparoscopic cholecystectomy. For the first time, we provide a domain-agnostic\nprocedure for video-based assessment of surgical skills. A significant\nimplication of this approach is that it allows the use of data from surgical\nsimulators to assess performance in the operating room.",

    "abstract": "Proteins are fundamental biological entities that play a key role in life\nactivities. The amino acid sequences of proteins can be folded into stable 3D\nstructures in the real physicochemical world, forming a special kind of\nsequence-structure data. With the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\ntechniques, Protein Representation Learning (PRL) has recently emerged as a\npromising research topic for extracting informative knowledge from massive\nprotein sequences or structures. To pave the way for AI researchers with little\nbioinformatics background, we present a timely and comprehensive review of PRL\nformulations and existing PRL methods from the perspective of model\narchitectures, pretext tasks, and downstream applications. We first briefly\nintroduce the motivations for protein representation learning and formulate it\nin a general and unified framework. Next, we divide existing PRL methods into\nthree main categories: sequence-based, structure-based, and sequence-structure\nco-modeling. Finally, we discuss some technical challenges and potential\ndirections for improving protein representation learning.

    "abstract": "Deploying reliable deep learning techniques in interdisciplinary applications\nneeds learned models to output accurate and ({even more importantly})\nexplainable predictions. Existing approaches typically explicate network\noutputs in a post-hoc fashion, under an implicit assumption that faithful\nexplanations come from accurate predictions/classifications. We have an\nopposite claim that explanations boost (or even determine) classification. That\nis, end-to-end learning of explanation factors to augment discriminative\nrepresentation extraction could be a more intuitive strategy to inversely\nassure fine-grained explainability, e.g., in those neuroimaging and\nneuroscience studies with high-dimensional data containing noisy, redundant,\nand task-irrelevant information. In this paper, we propose such an explainable\ngeometric deep network dubbed as NeuroExplainer, with applications to uncover\naltered infant cortical development patterns associated with preterm birth.\nGiven fundamental cortical attributes as network input, our NeuroExplainer\nadopts a hierarchical attention-decoding framework to learn fine-grained\nattentions and respective discriminative representations to accurately\nrecognize preterm infants from term-born infants at term-equivalent age.\nNeuroExplainer learns the hierarchical attention-decoding modules under\nsubject-level weak supervision coupled with targeted regularizers deduced from\ndomain knowledge regarding brain development. These prior-guided constraints\nimplicitly maximizes the explainability metrics (i.e., fidelity, sparsity, and\nstability) in network training, driving the learned network to output detailed\nexplanations and accurate classifications. Experimental results on the public\ndHCP benchmark suggest that NeuroExplainer led to quantitatively reliable\nexplanation results that are qualitatively consistent with representative\nneuroimaging studies.",

    "abstract": "Text clustering and topic extraction are two important tasks in text mining.\nUsually, these two tasks are performed separately. For topic extraction to\nfacilitate clustering, we can first project texts into a topic space and then\nperform a clustering algorithm to obtain clusters. To promote topic extraction\nby clustering, we can first obtain clusters with a clustering algorithm and\nthen extract cluster-specific topics. However, this naive strategy ignores the\nfact that text clustering and topic extraction are strongly correlated and\nfollow a chicken-and-egg relationship. Performing them separately fails to make\nthem mutually benefit each other to achieve the best overall performance. In\nthis paper, we propose an unsupervised text clustering and topic extraction\nframework (ClusTop) which integrates text clustering and topic extraction into\na unified framework and can achieve high-quality clustering result and extract\ntopics from each cluster simultaneously. Our framework includes four\ncomponents: enhanced language model training, dimensionality reduction,\nclustering and topic extraction, where the enhanced language model can be\nviewed as a bridge between clustering and topic extraction. On one hand, it\nprovides text embeddings with a strong cluster structure which facilitates\neffective text clustering; on the other hand, it pays high attention on the\ntopic related words for topic extraction because of its self-attention\narchitecture. Moreover, the training of enhanced language model is\nunsupervised. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nframework and provide benchmarks for different model combinations in this\nframework.",

    "abstract": "Wind power forecasting helps with the planning for the power systems by\ncontributing to having a higher level of certainty in decision-making. Due to\nthe randomness inherent to meteorological events (e.g., wind speeds), making\nhighly accurate long-term predictions for wind power can be extremely\ndifficult. One approach to remedy this challenge is to utilize weather\ninformation from multiple points across a geographical grid to obtain a\nholistic view of the wind patterns, along with temporal information from the\nprevious power outputs of the wind farms. Our proposed CNN-RNN architecture\ncombines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks\n(RNNs) to extract spatial and temporal information from multi-dimensional input\ndata to make day-ahead predictions. In this regard, our method incorporates an\nultra-wide learning view, combining data from multiple numerical weather\nprediction models, wind farms, and geographical locations. Additionally, we\nexperiment with global forecasting approaches to understand the impact of\ntraining the same model over the datasets obtained from multiple different wind\nfarms, and we employ a method where spatial information extracted from\nconvolutional layers is passed to a tree ensemble (e.g., Light Gradient\nBoosting Machine (LGBM)) instead of fully connected layers. The results show\nthat our proposed CNN-RNN architecture outperforms other models such as LGBM,\nExtra Tree regressor and linear regression when trained globally, but fails to\nreplicate such performance when trained individually on each farm. We also\nobserve that passing the spatial information from CNN to LGBM improves its\nperformance, providing further evidence of CNN's spatial feature extraction\ncapabilities.",

These shortcomings inhibit the digital transformation in\ngeneral and seem particularly concerning in the context of novel applications\nsuch as access control for decentralized autonomous organizations and\nidentification in the Metaverse. Decentralized or self-sovereign identity (SSI)\naims to offer a solution to this dilemma by empowering individuals to manage\ntheir digital identity through machine-verifiable attestations stored in a\n\"digital wallet\" application on their edge devices. However, when presented to\na relying party, these attestations typically reveal more attributes than\nrequired and allow tracking end users' activities. Several academic works and\npractical solutions exist to reduce or avoid such excessive information\ndisclosure, from simple selective disclosure to data-minimizing anonymous\ncredentials based on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). We first demonstrate that\nthe SSI solutions that are currently built with anonymous credentials still\nlack essential features such as scalable revocation, certificate chaining, and\nintegration with secure elements. We then argue that general-purpose ZKPs in\nthe form of zk-SNARKs can appropriately address these pressing challenges. We\ndescribe our implementation and conduct performance tests on different edge\ndevices to illustrate that the performance of zk-SNARK-based anonymous\ncredentials is already practical. We also discuss further advantages that\ngeneral-purpose ZKPs can easily provide for digital wallets, for instance, to\ncreate \"designated verifier presentations\" that facilitate new design options\nfor digital identity infrastructures that previously were not accessible\nbecause of the threat of man-in-the-middle attacks.",

While much of the literature has\nfocused on discounted MDPs, robust average-reward MDPs remain largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we focus on robust average-reward MDPs, where the\ngoal is to find a policy that optimizes the worst-case average reward over an\nuncertainty set. We first take an approach that approximates average-reward\nMDPs using discounted MDPs. We prove that the robust discounted value function\nconverges to the robust average-reward as the discount factor $\\gamma$ goes to\n$1$, and moreover, when $\\gamma$ is large, any optimal policy of the robust\ndiscounted MDP is also an optimal policy of the robust average-reward. We\nfurther design a robust dynamic programming approach, and theoretically\ncharacterize its convergence to the optimum. Then, we investigate robust\naverage-reward MDPs directly without using discounted MDPs as an intermediate\nstep. We derive the robust Bellman equation for robust average-reward MDPs,\nprove that the optimal policy can be derived from its solution, and further\ndesign a robust relative value iteration algorithm that provably finds its\nsolution, or equivalently, the optimal robust policy.",

    "abstract": "Domain-specific accelerators are used in various computing systems ranging\nfrom edge devices to data centers. Coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs)\nrepresent an architectural midpoint between the flexibility of an FPGA and the\nefficiency of an ASIC and are a promising candidate for servicing multi-tasked\nworkloads within an application domain. Unfortunately, scheduling multiple\ntasks onto a CGRA is challenging. CGRAs lack abstractions that capture hardware\nresources, leaving workload schedulers unable to reason about performance,\nenergy, and utilization for different schedules. This work first proposes a\nCGRA architecture that can flexibly partition key resources, including the\nglobal buffer memory capacity, the global buffer memory bandwidth, and the\ncompute resources. Partitioned resources serve as hardware abstractions that\ndecouple compilation and resource allocation. The compiler uses these\nabstractions for coarse-grained resource mapping, and the scheduler uses them\nfor flexible resource allocation at run time. We then propose two hardware\nmechanisms to support multi-task execution. A flexible-shape execution region\nincreases the overall resource utilization by mapping multiple tasks with\ndifferent resource requirements. Dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) enables\na CGRA to update the hardware configuration as the scheduler makes decisions\nrapidly.

However, in practice, PCDs are often\nincomplete when objects are viewed from few and sparse viewpoints before the\ngrasping action, leading to the generation of wrong or inaccurate grasp poses.\nWe propose a novel grasping strategy, named 3DSGrasp, that predicts the missing\ngeometry from the partial PCD to produce reliable grasp poses. Our proposed PCD\ncompletion network is a Transformer-based encoder-decoder network with an\nOffset-Attention layer.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, time-stamped web documents related to a general news query floods\nspread throughout the Internet, and timeline summarization targets concisely\nsummarizing the evolution trajectory of events along the timeline. Unlike\ntraditional document summarization, timeline summarization needs to model the\ntime series information of the input events and summarize important events in\nchronological order. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose a\nUnified Timeline Summarizer (UTS) that can generate abstractive and extractive\ntimeline summaries in time order. Concretely, in the encoder part, we propose a\ngraph-based event encoder that relates multiple events according to their\ncontent dependency and learns a global representation of each event. In the\ndecoder part, to ensure the chronological order of the abstractive summary, we\npropose to extract the feature of event-level attention in its generation\nprocess with sequential information remained and use it to simulate the\nevolutionary attention of the ground truth summary. The event-level attention\ncan also be used to assist in extracting summary, where the extracted summary\nalso comes in time sequence. We augment the previous Chinese large-scale\ntimeline summarization dataset and collect a new English timeline dataset.\nExtensive experiments conducted on these datasets and on the out-of-domain\nTimeline 17 dataset show that UTS achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nterms of both automatic and human evaluations.",

For classical digital computing\nmachines such requirements pose no fundamental problems as long as the physical\nclock rate is fast enough for the fastest relevant timescales. However, when\ndigital microchips become scaled down into the few-nanometer range where\nquantum noise and device mismatch become unavoidable, or when the digital\ncomputing paradigm is altogether abandoned in analog neuromorphic systems or\nother unconventional hardware bases, it can become difficult to relate\ntimescale conditions to the physical hardware dynamics. Here we explore the\nrelations between task-defined timescale conditions and physical hardware\ntimescales in some depth. The article has two main parts. In the first part we\ndevelop an abstract model of a generic computational system that admits a\nunified discussion of computational timescales. This model is general enough to\ncover digital computing systems as well as analog neuromorphic or other\nunconventional ones. We identify four major types of timescales which require\nseparate considerations: causal physical timescales; timescales of phenomenal\nchange which characterize the ``speed'' of how something changes in time;\ntimescales of reactivity which describe how fast a computing system can react\nto incoming trigger information; and memory timescales.

    "abstract": "Adversarial robustness assessment for video recognition models has raised\nconcerns owing to their wide applications on safety-critical tasks. Compared\nwith images, videos have much high dimension, which brings huge computational\ncosts when generating adversarial videos. This is especially serious for the\nquery-based black-box attacks where gradient estimation for the threat models\nis usually utilized, and high dimensions will lead to a large number of\nqueries. To mitigate this issue, we propose to simultaneously eliminate the\ntemporal and spatial redundancy within the video to achieve an effective and\nefficient gradient estimation on the reduced searching space, and thus query\nnumber could decrease. To implement this idea, we design the novel Adversarial\nspatial-temporal Focus (AstFocus) attack on videos, which performs attacks on\nthe simultaneously focused key frames and key regions from the inter-frames and\nintra-frames in the video. AstFocus attack is based on the cooperative\nMulti-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework. One agent is responsible\nfor selecting key frames, and another agent is responsible for selecting key\nregions. These two agents are jointly trained by the common rewards received\nfrom the black-box threat models to perform a cooperative prediction. By\ncontinuously querying, the reduced searching space composed of key frames and\nkey regions is becoming precise, and the whole query number becomes less than\nthat on the original video. Extensive experiments on four mainstream video\nrecognition models and three widely used action recognition datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed AstFocus attack outperforms the SOTA methods,\nwhich is prevenient in fooling rate, query number, time, and perturbation\nmagnitude at the same.",

The goal is to discover an intelligent\ndecision rule that processes information available to growers and prescribes\nsensible irrigation amounts for the time steps considered. Due to the technical\nnovelty, however, the research on the technique remains sparse and impractical.\nTo accelerate the progress, the paper proposes a general framework and\nactionable procedure that allow researchers to formulate their own optimisation\nproblems and implement solution algorithms based on deep reinforcement\nlearning. The effectiveness of the framework was demonstrated using a case\nstudy of irrigated wheat grown in a productive region of Australia where\nprofits were maximised. Specifically, the decision rule takes nine state\nvariable inputs: crop phenological stage, leaf area index, extractable soil\nwater for each of the five top layers, cumulative rainfall and cumulative\nirrigation. It returns a probabilistic prescription over five candidate\nirrigation amounts (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 mm) every day. The production system\nwas simulated at Goondiwindi using the APSIM-Wheat crop model.

    "title": "Towards Modeling and Influencing the Dynamics of Human Learning",
    "abstract": "Humans have internal models of robots (like their physical capabilities), the\nworld (like what will happen next), and their tasks (like a preferred goal).\nHowever, human internal models are not always perfect: for example, it is easy\nto underestimate a robot's inertia. Nevertheless, these models change and\nimprove over time as humans gather more experience. Interestingly, robot\nactions influence what this experience is, and therefore influence how people's\ninternal models change. In this work we take a step towards enabling robots to\nunderstand the influence they have, leverage it to better assist people, and\nhelp human models more quickly align with reality. Our key idea is to model the\nhuman's learning as a nonlinear dynamical system which evolves the human's\ninternal model given new observations. We formulate a novel optimization\nproblem to infer the human's learning dynamics from demonstrations that\nnaturally exhibit human learning. We then formalize how robots can influence\nhuman learning by embedding the human's learning dynamics model into the robot\nplanning problem. Although our formulations provide concrete problem\nstatements, they are intractable to solve in full generality. We contribute an\napproximation that sacrifices the complexity of the human internal models we\ncan represent, but enables robots to learn the nonlinear dynamics of these\ninternal models. We evaluate our inference and planning methods in a suite of\nsimulated environments and an in-person user study, where a 7DOF robotic arm\nteaches participants to be better teleoperators. While influencing human\nlearning remains an open problem, our results demonstrate that this influence\nis possible and can be helpful in real human-robot interaction.",

However, the need to explore\ndiverse experiences in order to learn optimal policies often limits the\napplication of RL techniques in safety-critical systems like vehicle control.\nIn this paper, an exponential control barrier function (ECBF) is derived and\nutilized to filter unsafe actions proposed by an RL-based driver assistance\nsystem.

    "abstract": "In the era of information overload, recommender systems (RSs) have become an\nindispensable part of online service platforms. Traditional RSs estimate user\ninterests and predict their future behaviors by utilizing correlations in the\nobservational historical activities, their profiles, and the content of\ninteracted items. However, since the inherent causal reasons that lead to the\nobserved users' behaviors are not considered, multiple types of biases could\nexist in the generated recommendations. In addition, the causal motives that\ndrive user activities are usually entangled in these RSs, where the\nexplainability and generalization abilities of recommendations cannot be\nguaranteed. To address these drawbacks, recent years have witnessed an upsurge\nof interest in enhancing traditional RSs with causal inference techniques. In\nthis survey, we provide a systematic overview of causal RSs and help readers\ngain a comprehensive understanding of this promising area. We start with the\nbasic concepts of traditional RSs and their limitations due to the lack of\ncausal reasoning ability. We then discuss how different causal inference\ntechniques can be introduced to address these challenges, with an emphasis on\ndebiasing, explainability promotion, and generalization improvement.\nFurthermore, we thoroughly analyze various evaluation strategies for causal\nRSs, focusing especially on how to reliably estimate their performance with\nbiased data if the causal effects of interests are unavailable.

In particular, privacy-preserving IoT connects\ndevices embedded with sensors and maintains the data privacy of people.\nHowever, common misconceptions exist among IoT researchers, service providers,\nand users about privacy-preserving IoT.\nThis article refutes five common misconceptions about privacy-preserving IoT\nconcerning data sensing and innovation, regulations, and privacy safeguards.\nFor example, IoT users have a common misconception that no data collection is\npermitted in data privacy regulations. On the other hand, IoT service providers\noften think data privacy impedes IoT sensing and innovation. Addressing these\nmisconceptions is essential for making progress in privacy-preserving IoT. This\narticle refutes such common misconceptions using real-world experiments and\nonline survey research. First, the experiments indicate that data privacy\nshould not be perceived as an impediment in IoT but as an opportunity to\nincrease customer retention and trust. Second, privacy-preserving IoT is not\nexclusively a regulatory problem but also a functional necessity that must be\nincorporated in the early stages of any IoT design. Third, people do not trust\nservices that lack sufficient privacy measures. Fourth, conventional data\nsecurity principles do not guarantee data privacy protection, and data privacy\ncan be exposed even if data is securely stored.

    "abstract": "We consider infinite horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) with fast-slow\nstructure, meaning that certain parts of the state space move \"fast\" (and in a\nsense, are more influential) while other parts transition more \"slowly.\" Such\nstructure is common in real-world problems where sequential decisions need to\nbe made at high frequencies, yet information that varies at a slower timescale\nalso influences the optimal policy. Examples include: (1) service allocation\nfor a multi-class queue with (slowly varying) stochastic costs, (2) a restless\nmulti-armed bandit with an environmental state, and (3) energy demand response,\nwhere both day-ahead and real-time prices play a role in the firm's revenue.\nModels that fully capture these problems often result in MDPs with large state\nspaces and large effective time horizons (due to frequent decisions), rendering\nthem computationally intractable. We propose an approximate dynamic programming\nalgorithmic framework based on the idea of \"freezing\" the slow states, solving\na set of simpler finite-horizon MDPs (the lower-level MDPs), and applying value\niteration (VI) to an auxiliary MDP that transitions on a slower timescale (the\nupper-level MDP). We also extend the technique to a function approximation\nsetting, where a feature-based linear architecture is used. On the theoretical\nside, we analyze the regret incurred by each variant of our frozen-state\napproach. Finally, we give empirical evidence that the frozen-state approach\ngenerates effective policies using just a fraction of the computational cost,\nwhile illustrating that simply omitting slow states from the decision modeling\nis often not a viable heuristic.",

    "abstract": "Computational units in artificial neural networks follow a simplified model\nof biological neurons. In the biological model, the output signal of a neuron\nruns down the axon, splits following the many branches at its end, and passes\nidentically to all the downward neurons of the network. Each of the downward\nneurons will use their copy of this signal as one of many inputs dendrites,\nintegrate them all and fire an output, if above some threshold. In the\nartificial neural network, this translates to the fact that the nonlinear\nfiltering of the signal is performed in the upward neuron, meaning that in\npractice the same activation is shared between all the downward neurons that\nuse that signal as their input. Dendrites thus play a passive role.\nWe propose a slightly more complex model for the biological neuron, where\ndendrites play an active role: the activation in the output of the upward\nneuron becomes optional, and instead the signals going through each dendrite\nundergo independent nonlinear filterings, before the linear combination.\nWe implement this new model into a ReLU computational unit and discuss its\nbiological plausibility. We compare this new computational unit with the\nstandard one and describe it from a geometrical point of view. We provide a\nKeras implementation of this unit into fully connected and convolutional layers\nand estimate their FLOPs and weights change. We then use these layers in ResNet\narchitectures on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Imagenette, and Imagewoof, obtaining\nperformance improvements over standard ResNets up to 1.73%.

Despite\nits scalability and ease of use, many users who own sensitive data refrain from\nfully utilizing cloud services due to confidentiality concerns. Maintaining\ndata confidentiality for data at rest and in transit has been widely explored\nbut data remains vulnerable in the cloud while it is in use. This vulnerability\nis further elevated once the scope of computing spans across the edge-to-cloud\ncontinuum. Accordingly, the goal of this dissertation is to enable data\nconfidentiality by adopting confidential computing across the continuum.\nTowards this goal, one approach we explore is to separate the intelligence\naspect of data processing from the pattern-matching aspect. We present our\napproach to make confidential data clustering on the cloud, and then develop\nconfidential search service across edge-to-cloud for unstructured text data.\nOur proposed clustering solution named ClusPr, performs topic-based clustering\nfor static and dynamic datasets that improves cluster coherency up to\n30%-to-60% when compared with other encryption-based clustering techniques. Our\ntrusted enterprise search service named SAED, provides context-aware and\npersonalized semantic search over confidential data across the continuum. We\nrealized that enabling confidential computing across edge-to-cloud requires\nmajor contribution from the edge tiers particularly to run multiple Deep\nLearning (DL) services concurrently. This raises memory contention on the edge\ntier. To resolve this, we develop Edge-MultiAI framework to manage Neural\nNetwork (NN) models of DL applications such that it can meet the latency\nconstraints of the DL applications without compromising inference accuracy.",

However, most of the existing works on data valuation\nrequire actual training of a model, which often demands high-computational\ncost.

They should be accessible to a\ntypical engineering graduate student with a strong background in Applied\nMathematics.\nThe main objective of these notes is to introduce a student who is familiar\nwith concepts in linear algebra and partial differential equations to select\ntopics in deep learning. These lecture notes exploit the strong connections\nbetween deep learning algorithms and the more conventional techniques of\ncomputational physics to achieve two goals. First, they use concepts from\ncomputational physics to develop an understanding of deep learning algorithms.\nNot surprisingly, many concepts in deep learning can be connected to similar\nconcepts in computational physics, and one can utilize this connection to\nbetter understand these algorithms. Second, several novel deep learning\nalgorithms can be used to solve challenging problems in computational physics.\nThus, they offer someone who is interested in modeling a physical phenomena\nwith a complementary set of tools.",

    "abstract": "Context: Stack Overflow (SO) has won the intention from software engineers\n(e.g., architects) to learn, practice, and utilize development knowledge, such\nas Architectural Knowledge (AK). But little is known about AK communicated in\nSO, which is a type of high-level but important knowledge in development.\nObjective: This study aims to investigate the AK in SO posts in terms of their\ncategories and characteristics as well as their usefulness from the point of\nview of SO users. Method: We conducted an exploratory study by qualitatively\nanalyzing a statistically representative sample of 968 Architecture Related\nPosts (ARPs) from SO. Results: The main findings are: (1) architecture related\nquestions can be classified into 9 core categories, in which \"architecture\nconfiguration\" is the most common category, followed by the \"architecture\ndecision\" category, and (2) architecture related questions that provide clear\ndescriptions together with architectural diagrams increase their likelihood of\ngetting more than one answer, while poorly structured architecture questions\ntend to only get one answer. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that future\nresearch can focus on enabling automated approaches and tools that could\nfacilitate the search and (re)use of AK in SO. SO users can refer to our\nproposed guidelines to compose architecture related questions with the\nlikelihood of getting more responses in SO.",

    "abstract": "In large-scale machine learning, recent works have studied the effects of\ncompressing gradients in stochastic optimization in order to alleviate the\ncommunication bottleneck. These works have collectively revealed that\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) is robust to structured perturbations such as\nquantization, sparsification, and delays. Perhaps surprisingly, despite the\nsurge of interest in large-scale, multi-agent reinforcement learning, almost\nnothing is known about the analogous question: Are common reinforcement\nlearning (RL) algorithms also robust to similar perturbations? In this paper,\nwe investigate this question by studying a variant of the classical temporal\ndifference (TD) learning algorithm with a perturbed update direction, where a\ngeneral compression operator is used to model the perturbation. Our main\ntechnical contribution is to show that compressed TD algorithms, coupled with\nan error-feedback mechanism used widely in optimization, exhibit the same\nnon-asymptotic theoretical guarantees as their SGD counterparts. We then extend\nour results significantly to nonlinear stochastic approximation algorithms and\nmulti-agent settings. In particular, we prove that for multi-agent TD learning,\none can achieve linear convergence speedups in the number of agents while\ncommunicating just $\\tilde{O}(1)$ bits per agent at each time step. Our work is\nthe first to provide finite-time results in RL that account for general\ncompression operators and error-feedback in tandem with linear function\napproximation and Markovian sampling. Our analysis hinges on studying the drift\nof a novel Lyapunov function that captures the dynamics of a memory variable\nintroduced by error feedback.",

    "abstract": "In the sea-land clutter classification of sky-wave over-the-horizon-radar\n(OTHR), the imbalanced and scarce data leads to a poor performance of the deep\nlearning-based classification model. To solve this problem, this paper proposes\nan improved auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network~(AC-GAN)\narchitecture, namely auxiliary classifier variational autoencoder generative\nadversarial network (AC-VAEGAN). AC-VAEGAN can synthesize higher quality\nsea-land clutter samples than AC-GAN and serve as an effective tool for data\naugmentation. Specifically, a 1-dimensional convolutional AC-VAEGAN\narchitecture is designed to synthesize sea-land clutter samples. Additionally,\nan evaluation method combining both traditional evaluation of GAN domain and\nstatistical evaluation of signal domain is proposed to evaluate the quality of\nsynthetic samples. Using a dataset of OTHR sea-land clutter, both the quality\nof the synthetic samples and the performance of data augmentation of AC-VAEGAN\nare verified. Further, the effect of AC-VAEGAN as a data augmentation method on\nthe classification performance of imbalanced and scarce sea-land clutter\nsamples is validated. The experiment results show that the quality of samples\nsynthesized by AC-VAEGAN is better than that of AC-GAN, and the data\naugmentation method with AC-VAEGAN is able to improve the classification\nperformance in the case of imbalanced and scarce sea-land clutter samples.",

    "abstract": "Panoptic Part Segmentation (PPS) unifies panoptic segmentation and part\nsegmentation into one task. Previous works utilize separated approaches to\nhandle thing, stuff, and part predictions without shared computation and task\nassociation. We aim to unify these tasks at the architectural level, designing\nthe first end-to-end unified framework named Panoptic-PartFormer. Moreover, we\nfind the previous metric PartPQ biases to PQ. To handle both issues, we make\nthe following contributions: Firstly, we design a meta-architecture that\ndecouples part feature and things/stuff feature, respectively. We model things,\nstuff, and parts as object queries and directly learn to optimize all three\nforms of prediction as a unified mask prediction and classification problem. We\nterm our model as Panoptic-PartFormer. Secondly, we propose a new metric\nPart-Whole Quality (PWQ) to better measure such task from both pixel-region and\npart-whole perspectives. It can also decouple the error for part segmentation\nand panoptic segmentation. Thirdly, inspired by Mask2Former, based on our\nmeta-architecture, we propose Panoptic-PartFormer++ and design a new part-whole\ncross attention scheme to further boost part segmentation qualities. We design\na new part-whole interaction method using masked cross attention. Finally, the\nextensive ablation studies and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of both\nPanoptic-PartFormer and Panoptic-PartFormer++. Compared with previous\nPanoptic-PartFormer, our Panoptic-PartFormer++ achieves 2% PartPQ and 3% PWQ\nimprovements on the Cityscapes PPS dataset and 5% PartPQ on the Pascal Context\nPPS dataset. On both datasets, Panoptic-PartFormer++ achieves new\nstate-of-the-art results with a significant cost drop of 70% on GFlops and 50%\non parameters. Our models can serve as a strong baseline and aid future\nresearch in PPS. Code will be available.",

This\npaper discusses the understanding and virtual simulation of such a robot\ncapable of detecting and understanding human emotions, generating its gait, and\nresponding via sounds and expression on a screen. To this end, we use a\ncombination of reinforcement learning and software engineering concepts to\nsimulate a quadruped robot that can understand emotions, navigate through\nvarious terrains and detect sound sources, and respond to emotions using\naudio-visual feedback. This paper aims to establish the framework of simulating\na quadruped robot that is emotionally intelligent and can primarily respond to\naudio-visual stimuli using motor or audio response. The emotion detection from\nthe speech was not as performant as ERANNs or Zeta Policy learning, still\nmanaging an accuracy of 63.5%. The video emotion detection system produced\nresults that are almost at par with the state of the art, with an accuracy of\n99.66%. Due to its \"on-policy\" learning process, the PPO algorithm was\nextremely rapid to learn, allowing the simulated dog to demonstrate a\nremarkably seamless gait across the different cadences and variations.

Prior methods successfully\npreserve the character of clothing images, however, occlusion remains a\npernicious effect for realistic virtual try-on.

Based on the in-depth analysis, we find that the\nocclusions can be simulated by a novel semantically-guided mixup module, which\ncan generate semantic-specific occluded images that work together with the\ntry-on images to facilitate training a de-occlusion try-on (DOC-VTON)\nframework. Specifically, DOC-VTON first conducts a sharpened semantic parsing\non the try-on person.

It is a core technology in software security, especially in\nvulnerability discovery and malware analysis. In recent years, with the\nsuccessful application of neural machine translation (NMT) models in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP), researchers have tried to build neural decompilers\nby borrowing the idea of NMT. They formulate the decompilation process as a\ntranslation problem between LPL and HPL, aiming to reduce the human cost\nrequired to develop decompilation tools and improve their generalizability.\nHowever, state-of-the-art learning-based decompilers do not cope well with\ncompiler-optimized binaries.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nlearning-based approach named NeurDP, that targets compiler-optimized binaries.\nNeurDP uses a graph neural network (GNN) model to convert LPL to an\nintermediate representation (IR), which bridges the gap between source code and\noptimized binary.

In\nthis paper, we aim to comprehensively analyze the robustness of LiDAR semantic\nsegmentation models under various corruptions. To rigorously evaluate the\nrobustness and generalizability of current approaches, we propose a new\nbenchmark called SemanticKITTI-C, which features 16 out-of-domain LiDAR\ncorruptions in three groups, namely adverse weather, measurement noise and\ncross-device discrepancy. Then, we systematically investigate 11 LiDAR semantic\nsegmentation models, especially spanning different input representations (e.g.,\npoint clouds, voxels, projected images, and etc.), network architectures and\ntraining schemes. Through this study, we obtain two insights: 1) We find out\nthat the input representation plays a crucial role in robustness. Specifically,\nunder specific corruptions, different representations perform variously. 2)\nAlthough state-of-the-art methods on LiDAR semantic segmentation achieve\npromising results on clean data, they are less robust when dealing with noisy\ndata. Finally, based on the above observations, we design a robust LiDAR\nsegmentation model (RLSeg) which greatly boosts the robustness with simple but\neffective modifications.

    "abstract": "Interview has been regarded as one of the most crucial step for recruitment.\nTo fully prepare for the interview with the recruiters, job seekers usually\npractice with mock interviews between each other. However, such a mock\ninterview with peers is generally far away from the real interview experience:\nthe mock interviewers are not guaranteed to be professional and are not likely\nto behave like a real interviewer. Due to the rapid growth of online\nrecruitment in recent years, recruiters tend to have online interviews, which\nmakes it possible to collect real interview data from real interviewers. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel application named EZInterviewer, which aims to\nlearn from the online interview data and provides mock interview services to\nthe job seekers. The task is challenging in two ways: (1) the interview data\nare now available but still of low-resource; (2) to generate meaningful and\nrelevant interview dialogs requires thorough understanding of both resumes and\njob descriptions. To address the low-resource challenge, EZInterviewer is\ntrained on a very small set of interview dialogs. The key idea is to reduce the\nnumber of parameters that rely on interview dialogs by disentangling the\nknowledge selector and dialog generator so that most parameters can be trained\nwith ungrounded dialogs as well as the resume data that are not low-resource.\nEvaluation results on a real-world job interview dialog dataset indicate that\nwe achieve promising results to generate mock interviews.

    "abstract": "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is considered one of the primary concerns due to\nits effect on vision loss among most people with diabetes globally. The\nseverity of DR is mostly comprehended manually by ophthalmologists from fundus\nphotography-based retina images. This paper deals with an automated\nunderstanding of the severity stages of DR. In the literature, researchers have\nfocused on this automation using traditional machine learning-based algorithms\nand convolutional architectures. However, the past works hardly focused on\nessential parts of the retinal image to improve the model performance. In this\npaper, we adopt transformer-based learning models to capture the crucial\nfeatures of retinal images to understand DR severity better. We work with\nensembling image transformers, where we adopt four models, namely ViT (Vision\nTransformer), BEiT (Bidirectional Encoder representation for image\nTransformer), CaiT (Class-Attention in Image Transformers), and DeiT (Data\nefficient image Transformers), to infer the degree of DR severity from fundus\nphotographs. For experiments, we used the publicly available APTOS-2019\nblindness detection dataset, where the performances of the transformer-based\nmodels were quite encouraging.",

However, recent research generally focuses on\nshort-distance applications (i.e., phone unlocking) while lacking consideration\nof long-distance scenes (i.e., surveillance security checks). In order to\npromote relevant research and fill this gap in the community, we collect a\nlarge-scale Surveillance High-Fidelity Mask (SuHiFiMask) dataset captured under\n40 surveillance scenes, which has 101 subjects from different age groups with\n232 3D attacks (high-fidelity masks), 200 2D attacks (posters, portraits, and\nscreens), and 2 adversarial attacks. In this scene, low image resolution and\nnoise interference are new challenges faced in surveillance FAS. Together with\nthe SuHiFiMask dataset, we propose a Contrastive Quality-Invariance Learning\n(CQIL) network to alleviate the performance degradation caused by image quality\nfrom three aspects: (1) An Image Quality Variable module (IQV) is introduced to\nrecover image information associated with discrimination by combining the\nsuper-resolution network. (2) Using generated sample pairs to simulate quality\nvariance distributions to help contrastive learning strategies obtain robust\nfeature representation under quality variation. (3) A Separate Quality Network\n(SQN) is designed to learn discriminative features independent of image\nquality. Finally, a large number of experiments verify the quality of the\nSuHiFiMask dataset and the superiority of the proposed CQIL.",

    "abstract": "Increasing research interests focus on sequential recommender systems, aiming\nto model dynamic sequence representation precisely. However, the most commonly\nused loss function in state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models has\nessential limitations. To name a few, Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss\nsuffers the vanishing gradient problem from numerous negative sampling and\npredictionbiases; Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss subjects to negative sampling\nnumbers, thereby it is likely to ignore valuable negative examples and reduce\nthe training efficiency; Cross-Entropy (CE) loss only focuses on the last\ntimestamp of the training sequence, which causes low utilization of sequence\ninformation and results in inferior user sequence representation. To avoid\nthese limitations, in this paper, we propose to calculate Cumulative\nCross-Entropy (CCE) loss over the sequence. CCE is simple and direct, which\nenjoys the virtues of painless deployment, no negative sampling, and effective\nand efficient training. We conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark\ndatasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CCE. The results\nshow that employing CCE loss on three state-of-the-art models GRU4Rec, SASRec,\nand S3-Rec can reach 125.63%, 69.90%, and 33.24% average improvement of full\nranking NDCG@5, respectively.

    "abstract": "Transformer has achieved impressive successes for various computer vision\ntasks. However, most of existing studies require to pretrain the Transformer\nbackbone on a large-scale labeled dataset (e.g., ImageNet) for achieving\nsatisfactory performance, which is usually unavailable for medical images.\nAdditionally, due to the gap between medical and natural images, the\nimprovement generated by the ImageNet pretrained weights significantly degrades\nwhile transferring the weights to medical image processing tasks. In this\npaper, we propose Bootstrap Own Latent of Transformer (BOLT), a self-supervised\nlearning approach specifically for medical image classification with the\nTransformer backbone. Our BOLT consists of two networks, namely online and\ntarget branches, for self-supervised representation learning. Concretely, the\nonline network is trained to predict the target network representation of the\nsame patch embedding tokens with a different perturbation. To maximally\nexcavate the impact of Transformer from limited medical data, we propose an\nauxiliary difficulty ranking task. The Transformer is enforced to identify\nwhich branch (i.e., online/target) is processing the more difficult perturbed\ntokens. Overall, the Transformer endeavours itself to distill the\ntransformation-invariant features from the perturbed tokens to simultaneously\nachieve difficulty measurement and maintain the consistency of self-supervised\nrepresentations. The proposed BOLT is evaluated on three medical image\nprocessing tasks, i.e., skin lesion classification, knee fatigue fracture\ngrading and diabetic retinopathy grading. The experimental results validate the\nsuperiority of our BOLT for medical image classification, compared to ImageNet\npretrained weights and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches.",

To this end, we propose PPGeo (Policy Pre-training via\nGeometric modeling), an intuitive and straightforward fully self-supervised\nframework curated for the policy pretraining in visuomotor driving. We aim at\nlearning policy representations as a powerful abstraction by modeling 3D\ngeometric scenes on large-scale unlabeled and uncalibrated YouTube driving\nvideos.

    "abstract": "A Digital Twin (DT) is a simulation of a physical system that provides\ninformation to make decisions that add economic, social or commercial value.\nThe behaviour of a physical system changes over time, a DT must therefore be\ncontinually updated with data from the physical systems to reflect its changing\nbehaviour. For resource-constrained systems, updating a DT is non-trivial\nbecause of challenges such as on-board learning and the off-board data\ntransfer. This paper presents a framework for updating data-driven DTs of\nresource-constrained systems geared towards system health monitoring. The\nproposed solution consists of: (1) an on-board system running a light-weight DT\nallowing the prioritisation and parsimonious transfer of data generated by the\nphysical system; and (2) off-board robust updating of the DT and detection of\nanomalous behaviours. Two case studies are considered using a production gas\nturbine engine system to demonstrate the digital representation accuracy for\nreal-world, time-varying physical systems.",

Recent studies (e.g., predicting IoU\nwith an auxiliary head, Generalized Focal Loss, Rank & Sort Loss) have shown\nthat forcing these two loss terms to interact with each other in\nnon-conventional ways creates a useful inductive bias and improves performance.\nInspired by these works, we focus on the correlation between classification and\nlocalization and make two main contributions: (i) We provide an analysis about\nthe effects of correlation between classification and localization tasks in\nobject detectors. We identify why correlation affects the performance of\nvarious NMS-based and NMS-free detectors, and we devise measures to evaluate\nthe effect of correlation and use them to analyze common detectors. (ii)\nMotivated by our observations, e.g., that NMS-free detectors can also benefit\nfrom correlation, we propose Correlation Loss, a novel plug-in loss function\nthat improves the performance of various object detectors by directly\noptimizing correlation coefficients: E.g., Correlation Loss on Sparse R-CNN, an\nNMS-free method, yields 1.6 AP gain on COCO and 1.8 AP gain on Cityscapes\ndataset.

Overcoming the knowledge disruption of previously\nacquired concepts, a drawback affecting deep learning models and that goes by\nthe name of catastrophic forgetting, is a hard challenge. Currently, deep\nlearning methods can attain impressive results when the data modeled does not\nundergo a considerable distributional shift in subsequent learning sessions,\nbut whenever we expose such systems to this incremental setting, performance\ndrop very quickly.

Based on the observation that the\nrendered pixels at a low resolution are typically highly aliased, we present a\nnovel method for neural supersampling based on ray tracing 1/4-spp samples at\nthe high resolution. Our key insight is that the ray-traced samples at the\ntarget resolution are accurate and reliable, which makes the supersampling an\ninterpolation problem. We present a mask-reinforced neural network to\nreconstruct and interpolate high-quality image sequences. First, a novel\ntemporal accumulation network is introduced to compute the correlation between\ncurrent and previous features to significantly improve their temporal\nstability. Then a reconstruct network based on a multi-scale U-Net with skip\nconnections is adopted for reconstruction and generation of the desired\nhigh-resolution image. Experimental results and comparisons have shown that our\nproposed method can generate higher quality results of supersampling, without\nincreasing the total number of ray-tracing samples, over current\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

These\ntechnologies have a long history of application in production and have had\nnumerous positive impacts, but also hold great potential when integrated with\nIndustry 4.0 and advanced machine learning, particularly deep learning,\nsolutions. However, in order to implement these solutions in production and\nenable widespread adoption, the scalability and transferability of deep\nlearning methods have become a focus of research. While transfer learning has\nproven successful in many cases, particularly with computer vision and\nhomogenous data inputs, it can be challenging to apply to heterogeneous data.\nMotivated by the need to transfer and standardize established processes to\ndifferent, non-identical environments and by the challenge of adapting to\nheterogeneous data representations, this work introduces the Domain Adaptation\nNeural Network with Cyclic Supervision (DBACS) approach. DBACS addresses the\nissue of model generalization through domain adaptation, specifically for\nheterogeneous data, and enables the transfer and scalability of deep\nlearning-based statistical control methods in a general manner. Additionally,\nthe cyclic interactions between the different parts of the model enable DBACS\nto not only adapt to the domains, but also match them. To the best of our\nknowledge, DBACS is the first deep learning approach to combine adaptation and\nmatching for heterogeneous data settings. For comparison, this work also\nincludes subspace alignment and a multi-view learning that deals with\nheterogeneous representations by mapping data into correlated latent feature\nspaces. Finally, DBACS with its ability to adapt and match, is applied to a\nvirtual metrology use case for an etching process run on different machine\ntypes in semiconductor manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "As the accuracy of machine learning models increases at a fast rate, so does\ntheir demand for energy and compute resources. On a low level, the major part\nof these resources is consumed by data movement between different memory units.\nModern hardware architectures contain a form of fast memory (e.g., cache,\nregisters), which is small, and a slow memory (e.g., DRAM), which is larger but\nexpensive to access. We can only process data that is stored in fast memory,\nwhich incurs data movement (input/output-operations, or I/Os) between the two\nunits. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the I/Os\nneeded in sparse feedforward neural network (FFNN) inference. We establish\nbounds that determine the optimal number of I/Os up to a factor of 2 and\npresent a method that uses a number of I/Os within that range. Much of the\nI/O-complexity is determined by a few high-level properties of the FFNN (number\nof inputs, outputs, neurons, and connections), but if we want to get closer to\nthe exact lower bound, the instance-specific sparsity patterns need to be\nconsidered. Departing from the 2-optimal computation strategy, we show how to\nreduce the number of I/Os further with simulated annealing. Complementing this\nresult, we provide an algorithm that constructively generates networks with\nmaximum I/O-efficiency for inference. We test the algorithms and empirically\nverify our theoretical and algorithmic contributions.

    "title": "Further Improving Weakly-supervised Object Localization via Causal  Knowledge Distillation",
    "abstract": "Weakly-supervised object localization aims to indicate the category as well\nas the scope of an object in an image given only the image-level labels. Most\nof the existing works are based on Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and endeavor\nto enlarge the discriminative area inside the activation map to perceive the\nwhole object, yet ignore the co-occurrence confounder of the object and context\n(e.g., fish and water), which makes the model inspection hard to distinguish\nobject boundaries. Besides, the use of CAM also brings a dilemma problem that\nthe classification and localization always suffer from a performance gap and\ncan not reach their highest accuracy simultaneously. In this paper, we propose\na casual knowledge distillation method, dubbed KD-CI-CAM, to address these two\nunder-explored issues in one go. More specifically, we tackle the co-occurrence\ncontext confounder problem via causal intervention (CI), which explores the\ncausalities among image features, contexts, and categories to eliminate the\nbiased object-context entanglement in the class activation maps. Based on the\nde-biased object feature, we additionally propose a multi-teacher causal\ndistillation framework to balance the absorption of classification knowledge\nand localization knowledge during model training. Extensive experiments on\nseveral benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of KD-CI-CAM in learning clear\nobject boundaries from confounding contexts and addressing the dilemma problem\nbetween classification and localization performance.",

    "abstract": "Finding cycles in directed graphs enables important applications in various\ndomains such as finance, biology, chemistry, and network science. However, as\nthe size of graph datasets continues to grow, it becomes increasingly difficult\nto discover cycles within them, which necessitates more efficient algorithms\nand their parallel implementations. In this work, we propose scalable\nparallelisation of state-of-the-art sequential algorithms for enumerating\nsimple, temporal, and hop-constrained cycles. First, we focus on the simple\ncycle enumeration problem and parallelise the algorithms by Johnson and by Read\nand Tarjan in a fine-grained manner. We theoretically show that our resulting\nfine-grained parallel algorithms are scalable, with the fine-grained parallel\nRead-Tarjan algorithm being strongly scalable. In contrast, we show that\nstraightforward coarse-grained parallel versions of these simple cycle\nenumeration algorithms that exploit edge- or vertex-level parallelism are not\nscalable. Next, we adapt our fine-grained approach to enable scalable\nparallelisation of state-of-the-art algorithms for temporal and hop-constrained\ncycle enumeration. Our evaluation on a cluster with 256 physical cores\ndemonstrates a near-linear scalability of our fine-grained parallel algorithms\nwhen enumerating all the aforementioned types of cycles. On the same cluster,\nour fine-grained parallel algorithms achieve, on average, one order of\nmagnitude speedup compared to the respective coarse-grained parallel versions\nof the state-of-the-art algorithms for cycle enumeration. The performance gap\nbetween the fine-grained and the coarse-grained parallel algorithms increases\nas we use more CPU cores.",

Although\nexisting one-shot talking head methods have made significant progress in lip\nsync, natural facial expressions, and stable head motions, they still cannot\ngenerate diverse speaking styles in the final talking head videos. To tackle\nthis problem, we propose a one-shot style-controllable talking face generation\nframework. In a nutshell, we aim to attain a speaking style from an arbitrary\nreference speaking video and then drive the one-shot portrait to speak with the\nreference speaking style and another piece of audio. Specifically, we first\ndevelop a style encoder to extract dynamic facial motion patterns of a style\nreference video and then encode them into a style code. Afterward, we introduce\na style-controllable decoder to synthesize stylized facial animations from the\nspeech content and style code. In order to integrate the reference speaking\nstyle into generated videos, we design a style-aware adaptive transformer,\nwhich enables the encoded style code to adjust the weights of the feed-forward\nlayers accordingly. Thanks to the style-aware adaptation mechanism, the\nreference speaking style can be better embedded into synthesized videos during\ndecoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is capable of\ngenerating talking head videos with diverse speaking styles from only one\nportrait image and an audio clip while achieving authentic visual effects.\nProject Page: https://github.com/FuxiVirtualHuman/styletalk.",

    "abstract": "View-dependent effects such as reflections pose a substantial challenge for\nimage-based and neural rendering algorithms. Above all, curved reflectors are\nparticularly hard, as they lead to highly non-linear reflection flows as the\ncamera moves. We introduce a new point-based representation to compute Neural\nPoint Catacaustics allowing novel-view synthesis of scenes with curved\nreflectors, from a set of casually-captured input photos. At the core of our\nmethod is a neural warp field that models catacaustic trajectories of\nreflections, so complex specular effects can be rendered using efficient point\nsplatting in conjunction with a neural renderer. One of our key contributions\nis the explicit representation of reflections with a reflection point cloud\nwhich is displaced by the neural warp field, and a primary point cloud which is\noptimized to represent the rest of the scene. After a short manual annotation\nstep, our approach allows interactive high-quality renderings of novel views\nwith accurate reflection flow. Additionally, the explicit representation of\nreflection flow supports several forms of scene manipulation in captured\nscenes, such as reflection editing, cloning of specular objects, reflection\ntracking across views, and comfortable stereo viewing.

However, we observe that two drawbacks\nof the positive and negative sample construction mechanisms limit the\nperformance of existing algorithms from further improvement. 1) The quality of\npositive samples heavily depends on the carefully designed data augmentations,\nwhile inappropriate data augmentations would easily lead to the semantic drift\nand indiscriminative positive samples. 2) The constructed negative samples are\nnot reliable for ignoring important clustering information. To solve these\nproblems, we propose a Cluster-guided Contrastive deep Graph Clustering network\n(CCGC) by mining the intrinsic supervision information in the high-confidence\nclustering results. Specifically, instead of conducting complex node or edge\nperturbation, we construct two views of the graph by designing special Siamese\nencoders whose weights are not shared between the sibling sub-networks. Then,\nguided by the high-confidence clustering information, we carefully select and\nconstruct the positive samples from the same high-confidence cluster in two\nviews. Moreover, to construct semantic meaningful negative sample pairs, we\nregard the centers of different high-confidence clusters as negative samples,\nthus improving the discriminative capability and reliability of the constructed\nsample pairs. Lastly, we design an objective function to pull close the samples\nfrom the same cluster while pushing away those from other clusters by\nmaximizing and minimizing the cross-view cosine similarity between positive and\nnegative samples.

    "abstract": "Modeling lies at the core of both the financial and the insurance industry\nfor a wide variety of tasks. The rise and development of machine learning and\ndeep learning models have created many opportunities to improve our modeling\ntoolbox. Breakthroughs in these fields often come with the requirement of large\namounts of data. Such large datasets are often not publicly available in\nfinance and insurance, mainly due to privacy and ethics concerns. This lack of\ndata is currently one of the main hurdles in developing better models. One\npossible option to alleviating this issue is generative modeling. Generative\nmodels are capable of simulating fake but realistic-looking data, also referred\nto as synthetic data, that can be shared more freely. Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs) is such a model that increases our capacity to fit very\nhigh-dimensional distributions of data. While research on GANs is an active\ntopic in fields like computer vision, they have found limited adoption within\nthe human sciences, like economics and insurance. Reason for this is that in\nthese fields, most questions are inherently about identification of causal\neffects, while to this day neural networks, which are at the center of the GAN\nframework, focus mostly on high-dimensional correlations. In this paper we\nstudy the causal preservation capabilities of GANs and whether the produced\nsynthetic data can reliably be used to answer causal questions. This is done by\nperforming causal analyses on the synthetic data, produced by a GAN, with\nincreasingly more lenient assumptions. We consider the cross-sectional case,\nthe time series case and the case with a complete structural model. It is shown\nthat in the simple cross-sectional scenario where correlation equals causation\nthe GAN preserves causality, but that challenges arise for more advanced\nanalyses.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel technique, namely INVALIDATOR, to\nautomatically assess the correctness of APR-generated patches via semantic and\nsyntactic reasoning. INVALIDATOR reasons about program semantic via program\ninvariants while it also captures program syntax via language semantic learned\nfrom large code corpus using the pre-trained language model. Given a buggy\nprogram and the developer-patched program, INVALIDATOR infers likely invariants\non both programs. Then, INVALIDATOR determines that a APR-generated patch\noverfits if: (1) it violates correct specifications or (2) maintains errors\nbehaviors of the original buggy program. In case our approach fails to\ndetermine an overfitting patch based on invariants, INVALIDATOR utilizes a\ntrained model from labeled patches to assess patch correctness based on program\nsyntax. The benefit of INVALIDATOR is three-fold. First, INVALIDATOR is able to\nleverage both semantic and syntactic reasoning to enhance its discriminant\ncapability. Second, INVALIDATOR does not require new test cases to be generated\nbut instead only relies on the current test suite and uses invariant inference\nto generalize the behaviors of a program. Third, INVALIDATOR is fully\nautomated. We have conducted our experiments on a dataset of 885 patches\ngenerated on real-world programs in Defects4J. Experiment results show that\nINVALIDATOR correctly classified 79% overfitting patches, accounting for 23%\nmore overfitting patches being detected by the best baseline. INVALIDATOR also\nsubstantially outperforms the best baselines by 14% and 19% in terms of\nAccuracy and F-Measure, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The performance of inertial navigation systems is largely dependent on the\nstable flow of external measurements and information to guarantee continuous\nfilter updates and bind the inertial solution drift. Platforms in different\noperational environments may be prevented at some point from receiving external\nmeasurements, thus exposing their navigation solution to drift. Over the years,\na wide variety of works have been proposed to overcome this shortcoming, by\nexploiting knowledge of the system current conditions and turning it into an\napplicable source of information to update the navigation filter.

    "abstract": "Beamforming (BF) training is crucial to establishing reliable millimeter-wave\ncommunication connections between stations (STAs) and an access point. In IEEE\n802.11ad BF training protocol, all STAs contend for limited BF training\nopportunities, i.e., associated BF training (A-BFT) slots, which results in\nsevere collisions and significant BF training latency, especially in dense user\nscenarios. In this paper, we first develop an analytical model to evaluate the\nBF training protocol performance. Our analytical model accounts for various\nprotocol components, including user density, the number of A-BFT slots, and\nprotocol parameters, i.e., retry limit and contention window size. We then\nderive the average successful BF training probability, the BF training\nefficiency and latency. Since the derived BF training efficiency is an implicit\nfunction, to reveal the relationship between system parameters and BF training\nperformance, we also derive an approximate expression of BF training\nefficiency. Theoretical analysis indicates that the BF training efficiency\ndegrades drastically in dense user scenarios. To address this issue, we propose\nan enhancement scheme which adaptively adjusts the protocol parameters in tune\nwith user density, to improve the BF training performance in dense user\nscenarios. Extensive simulations are carried out to validate the accuracy of\nthe developed analytical model. In addition, simulation results show that the\nproposed enhancement scheme can improve the BF training efficiency by 35% in\ndense user scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Edge caching is emerging as the most promising solution to reduce the content\nretrieval delay and relieve the huge burden on the backhaul links in the\nultra-dense networks by proactive caching popular contents in the small base\nstation (SBS). However, constraint cache resource of individual SBSs\nsignificantly throttles the performance of edge caching. In this paper, we\npropose a device-to-device (D2D) assisted cooperative edge caching (DCEC)\npolicy for millimeter (mmWave) dense networks, which cooperatively utilizes the\ncache resource of users and SBSs in proximity. In the proposed DCEC policy, a\ncontent can be cached in either users' devices or SBSs according to the content\npopularity, and a user can retrieve the requested content from neighboring\nusers via D2D links or the neighboring SBSs via cellular links to efficiently\nexploit the cache diversity. Unlike existing cooperative caching policies in\nthe lower frequency bands that require complex interference management\ntechniques to suppress interference, we take advantage of directional antenna\nin mmWave systems to ensure high transmission rate whereas mitigating\ninterference footprint. Taking the practical directional antenna model and the\nnetwork density into consideration, we derive closed-form expressions of the\nbackhaul offloading performance and content retrieval delay based on the\nstochastic information of network topology. In addition, analytical results\nindicate that, with the increase of the network density, the content retrieval\ndelay via D2D links increases significantly while that via cellular links\nincreases slightly. Comprehensive simulations validate our theoretical analysis\nand demonstrate that the proposed policy can achieve higher performance in\noffloading the backhaul traffic and reducing the content retrieval delay\ncompared with the state-of-the-art most popular caching (MPC) policy.",

In this paper, we introduce our\nnoisy-label learning approach, called Asymmetric Co-teaching (AsyCo), which\nintroduces novel prediction disagreement that produces more consistent\ndivergent results of the co-teaching models, and a new sample selection\napproach that does not require small-loss assumption to enable a better\nrobustness to confirmation bias than previous methods. More specifically, the\nnew prediction disagreement is achieved with the use of different training\nstrategies, where one model is trained with multi-class learning and the other\nwith multi-label learning. Also, the new sample selection is based on\nmulti-view consensus, which uses the label views from training labels and model\npredictions to divide the training set into clean and noisy for training the\nmulti-class model and to re-label the training samples with multiple top-ranked\nlabels for training the multi-label model.

To\nrestore reliability, grid-interactive efficient buildings can provide\nflexibility services to the grid through demand response. Residential demand\nresponse programs are hindered by the need for manual intervention by\ncustomers. To maximize the energy flexibility potential of residential\nbuildings, an advanced control architecture is needed. Reinforcement learning\nis well-suited for the control of flexible resources as it is able to adapt to\nunique building characteristics compared to expert systems. Yet, factors\nhindering the adoption of RL in real-world applications include its large data\nrequirements for training, control security and generalizability.

    "title": "I2F: A Unified Image-to-Feature Approach for Domain Adaptive Semantic  Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation is a promising\ntask freeing people from heavy annotation work. However, domain discrepancies\nin low-level image statistics and high-level contexts compromise the\nsegmentation performance over the target domain. A key idea to tackle this\nproblem is to perform both image-level and feature-level adaptation jointly.\nUnfortunately, there is a lack of such unified approaches for UDA tasks in the\nexisting literature. This paper proposes a novel UDA pipeline for semantic\nsegmentation that unifies image-level and feature-level adaptation. Concretely,\nfor image-level domain shifts, we propose a global photometric alignment module\nand a global texture alignment module that align images in the source and\ntarget domains in terms of image-level properties. For feature-level domain\nshifts, we perform global manifold alignment by projecting pixel features from\nboth domains onto the feature manifold of the source domain; and we further\nregularize category centers in the source domain through a category-oriented\ntriplet loss and perform target domain consistency regularization over\naugmented target domain images. Experimental results demonstrate that our\npipeline significantly outperforms previous methods. In the commonly tested\nGTA5$\\rightarrow$Cityscapes task, our proposed method using Deeplab V3+ as the\nbackbone surpasses previous SOTA by 8%, achieving 58.2% in mIoU.",

    "title": "RELIANT: Fair Knowledge Distillation for Graph Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown satisfying performance on various\ngraph learning tasks. To achieve better fitting capability, most GNNs are with\na large number of parameters, which makes these GNNs computationally expensive.\nTherefore, it is difficult to deploy them onto edge devices with scarce\ncomputational resources, e.g., mobile phones and wearable smart devices.\nKnowledge Distillation (KD) is a common solution to compress GNNs, where a\nlight-weighted model (i.e., the student model) is encouraged to mimic the\nbehavior of a computationally expensive GNN (i.e., the teacher GNN model).\nNevertheless, most existing GNN-based KD methods lack fairness consideration.\nAs a consequence, the student model usually inherits and even exaggerates the\nbias from the teacher GNN. To handle such a problem, we take initial steps\ntowards fair knowledge distillation for GNNs. Specifically, we first formulate\na novel problem of fair knowledge distillation for GNN-based teacher-student\nframeworks. Then we propose a principled framework named RELIANT to mitigate\nthe bias exhibited by the student model. Notably, the design of RELIANT is\ndecoupled from any specific teacher and student model structures, and thus can\nbe easily adapted to various GNN-based KD frameworks. We perform extensive\nexperiments on multiple real-world datasets, which corroborates that RELIANT\nachieves less biased GNN knowledge distillation while maintaining high\nprediction utility.",

    "abstract": "Few Shot Instance Segmentation (FSIS) requires models to detect and segment\nnovel classes with limited several support examples. In this work, we explore a\nsimple yet unified solution for FSIS as well as its incremental variants, and\nintroduce a new framework named Reference Twice (RefT) to fully explore the\nrelationship between support/query features based on a Transformer-like\nframework. Our key insights are two folds: Firstly, with the aid of support\nmasks, we can generate dynamic class centers more appropriately to re-weight\nquery features. Secondly, we find that support object queries have already\nencoded key factors after base training. In this way, the query features can be\nenhanced twice from two aspects, i.e., feature-level and instance-level. In\nparticular, we firstly design a mask-based dynamic weighting module to enhance\nsupport features and then propose to link object queries for better calibration\nvia cross-attention. After the above steps, the novel classes can be improved\nsignificantly over our strong baseline. Additionally, our new framework can be\neasily extended to incremental FSIS with minor modification. When benchmarking\nresults on the COCO dataset for FSIS, gFSIS, and iFSIS settings, our method\nachieves a competitive performance compared to existing approaches across\ndifferent shots, e.g., we boost nAP by noticeable +8.2/+9.4 over the current\nstate-of-the-art FSIS method for 10/30-shot. We further demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our approach on Few Shot Object Detection. Code and model will\nbe available.",

In this paper, we extend Kubernetes networking to make use of\nSRv6, a feature-rich overlay networking mechanism. Integration with SRv6 can be\nvery beneficial when Kubernetes is used in large-scale and distributed\nmulti-datacenter scenarios. We have focused on the Calico CNI plugin, one of\nthe most used Kubernetes networking plugins.

The proposed SRv6 overlay networking solution for Kubernetes\noffers several advantages compared to a traditional overlay (e.g. IP in IP), in\nparticular the possibility to use Traffic Engineering for the overlay tunnels.\nIn the paper, we provide the architecture and the detailed design of the SRv6\nbased overlay and describe our open source implementation. We consider the\nresearch and technological question on how to extend Kubernetes networking to\nsupport large-scale and distributed multi-datacenter scenarios, which is an\nimportant goal for Cloud and Network providers. In this respect, we compare two\ndifferent solutions for the control plane architecture of the SRv6 capable\nKubernetes networking plugin, one based on the BGP routing protocol and another\none based on extending the Kubernetes control plane.

The method is based on a Fourier decomposition of the\nsource into a modal expansion and the evaluation of the corresponding modes of\nthe field using a two-dimensional tree decomposition in the radial and axial\ncoordinate. The field coefficients are evaluated using a modal Green's function\nwhich can be evaluated using well-known recursions for the Legendre function of\nthe second kind, and whose derivatives can be found recursively using the\nLaplace equation in cylindrical coordinates.

Results are presented for solution accuracy\nand convergence and for computation time compared to direct evaluation. The\nmethod is found to converge well, with ten digit accuracy being achieved for\nthe test cases presented.

Thus,\nthese videos are becoming a common artifact that developers must manage. In\nlight of unique mobile development constraints, including swift release cycles\nand rapidly evolving platforms, automated techniques for analyzing all types of\nrich software artifacts provide benefit to mobile developers. Unfortunately,\nautomatically analyzing screen recordings presents serious challenges, due to\ntheir graphical nature, compared to other types of (textual) artifacts. To\naddress these challenges, this paper introduces V2S+, an automated approach for\ntranslating video recordings of Android app usages into replayable scenarios.\nV2S+ is based primarily on computer vision techniques and adapts recent\nsolutions for object detection and image classification to detect and classify\nuser gestures captured in a video, and convert these into a replayable test\nscenario. Given that V2S+ takes a computer vision-based approach, it is\napplicable to both hybrid and native Android applications. We performed an\nextensive evaluation of V2S+ involving 243 videos depicting 4,028 GUI-based\nactions collected from users exercising features and reproducing bugs from a\ncollection of over 90 popular native and hybrid Android apps. Our results\nillustrate that V2S+ can accurately replay scenarios from screen recordings,\nand is capable of reproducing $\\approx$ 90.2% of sequential actions recorded in\nnative application scenarios on physical devices, and $\\approx$ 83% of\nsequential actions recorded in hybrid application scenarios on emulators, both\nwith low overhead.

    "abstract": "Dataset distillation has emerged as a prominent technique to improve data\nefficiency when training machine learning models. It encapsulates the knowledge\nfrom a large dataset into a smaller synthetic dataset. A model trained on this\nsmaller distilled dataset can attain comparable performance to a model trained\non the original training dataset. However, the existing dataset distillation\ntechniques mainly aim at achieving the best trade-off between resource usage\nefficiency and model utility. The security risks stemming from them have not\nbeen explored. This study performs the first backdoor attack against the models\ntrained on the data distilled by dataset distillation models in the image\ndomain. Concretely, we inject triggers into the synthetic data during the\ndistillation procedure rather than during the model training stage, where all\nprevious attacks are performed. We propose two types of backdoor attacks,\nnamely NAIVEATTACK and DOORPING. NAIVEATTACK simply adds triggers to the raw\ndata at the initial distillation phase, while DOORPING iteratively updates the\ntriggers during the entire distillation procedure. We conduct extensive\nevaluations on multiple datasets, architectures, and dataset distillation\ntechniques. Empirical evaluation shows that NAIVEATTACK achieves decent attack\nsuccess rate (ASR) scores in some cases, while DOORPING reaches higher ASR\nscores (close to 1.0) in all cases. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive\nablation study to analyze the factors that may affect the attack performance.\nFinally, we evaluate multiple defense mechanisms against our backdoor attacks\nand show that our attacks can practically circumvent these defense mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Successful implementation of oil spill segmentation in Synthetic Aperture\nRadar (SAR) images is vital for marine environmental protection. In this paper,\nwe develop an effective segmentation framework named DGNet, which performs oil\nspill segmentation by incorporating the intrinsic distribution of backscatter\nvalues in SAR images. Specifically, our proposed segmentation network is\nconstructed with two deep neural modules running in an interactive manner,\nwhere one is the inference module to achieve latent feature variable inference\nfrom SAR images, and the other is the generative module to produce oil spill\nsegmentation maps by drawing the latent feature variables as inputs. Thus, to\nyield accurate segmentation, we take into account the intrinsic distribution of\nbackscatter values in SAR images and embed it in our segmentation model. The\nintrinsic distribution originates from SAR imagery, describing the physical\ncharacteristics of oil spills. In the training process, the formulated\nintrinsic distribution guides efficient learning of optimal latent feature\nvariable inference for oil spill segmentation. The efficient learning enables\nthe training of our proposed DGNet with a small amount of image data. This is\neconomically beneficial to oil spill segmentation where the availability of oil\nspill SAR image data is limited in practice. Additionally, benefiting from\noptimal latent feature variable inference, our proposed DGNet performs accurate\noil spill segmentation. We evaluate the segmentation performance of our\nproposed DGNet with different metrics, and experimental evaluations demonstrate\nits effective segmentations.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an online-capable controller for the energy management\nsystem of a parallel hybrid electric vehicle based on model predictive control.\nIts task is to minimize the vehicle's fuel consumption along a predicted\ndriving mission by calculating the distribution of the driver's power request\nbetween the electrical and the combustive part of the powertrain, and by\nchoosing the driving mode, which depends on the vehicle's clutch state. The\ninclusion of the clutch state in a model predictive control structure is not\ntrivial because the underlying optimization problem becomes a mixed-integer\nprogram as a consequence. Using Pontryagin's Minimum Principle and a simplified\nvehicle model, it is possible to prove that a drive cycle-dependent critical\npower request Pcrit exists, which uniquely separates the optimal driving mode.\nBased on this result, a learning algorithm is proposed to determine Pcrit\nduring the operation of the vehicle. The learning algorithm is incorporated\ninto a multi-level controller structure and the working principle of the\nresulting multi-level learning-based model predictive controller is analyzed in\ndetail using two realistic driving missions. A comparison to the solution\nobtained by Dynamic Programming reveals that the proposed controller achieves\nclose-to-optimal performance.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we aim to tackle the challenging few-shot segmentation task\nfrom a new perspective. Typical methods follow the paradigm to firstly learn\nprototypical features from support images and then match query features in\npixel-level to obtain segmentation results. However, to obtain satisfactory\nsegments, such a paradigm needs to couple the learning of the matching\noperations with heavy segmentation modules, limiting the flexibility of design\nand increasing the learning complexity. To alleviate this issue, we propose\nMask Matching Transformer (MM-Former), a new paradigm for the few-shot\nsegmentation task. Specifically, MM-Former first uses a class-agnostic\nsegmenter to decompose the query image into multiple segment proposals. Then, a\nsimple matching mechanism is applied to merge the related segment proposals\ninto the final mask guided by the support images. The advantages of our\nMM-Former are two-fold. First, the MM-Former follows the paradigm of decompose\nfirst and then blend, allowing our method to benefit from the advanced\npotential objects segmenter to produce high-quality mask proposals for query\nimages. Second, the mission of prototypical features is relaxed to learn\ncoefficients to fuse correct ones within a proposal pool, making the MM-Former\nbe well generalized to complex scenarios or cases. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on the popular COCO-$20^i$ and Pascal-$5^i$ benchmarks. Competitive\nresults well demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalization ability of\nour MM-Former.",

Machine and statistical learning regression algorithms are regularly\nutilized in this endeavour.

    "abstract": "There is a growing interest in developing unlearnable examples (UEs) against\nvisual privacy leaks on the Internet. UEs are training samples added with\ninvisible but unlearnable noise, which have been found can prevent unauthorized\ntraining of machine learning models. UEs typically are generated via a bilevel\noptimization framework with a surrogate model to remove (minimize) errors from\nthe original samples, and then applied to protect the data against unknown\ntarget models. However, existing UE generation methods all rely on an ideal\nassumption called label-consistency, where the hackers and protectors are\nassumed to hold the same label for a given sample. In this work, we propose and\npromote a more practical label-agnostic setting, where the hackers may exploit\nthe protected data quite differently from the protectors. E.g., a m-class\nunlearnable dataset held by the protector may be exploited by the hacker as a\nn-class dataset. Existing UE generation methods are rendered ineffective in\nthis challenging setting. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel\ntechnique called Unlearnable Clusters (UCs) to generate label-agnostic\nunlearnable examples with cluster-wise perturbations. Furthermore, we propose\nto leverage VisionandLanguage Pre-trained Models (VLPMs) like CLIP as the\nsurrogate model to improve the transferability of the crafted UCs to diverse\ndomains.

In this paper, we\ntake the role of investigators who want to trace the attack and identify the\nsource, that is, the particular model which the adversarial examples are\ngenerated from. Techniques derived would aid forensic investigation of attack\nincidents and serve as deterrence to potential attacks. We consider the\nbuyers-seller setting where a machine learning model is to be distributed to\nvarious buyers and each buyer receives a slightly different copy with same\nfunctionality. A malicious buyer generates adversarial examples from a\nparticular copy $\\mathcal{M}_i$ and uses them to attack other copies. From\nthese adversarial examples, the investigator wants to identify the source\n$\\mathcal{M}_i$. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage\nseparate-and-trace framework. The model separation stage generates multiple\ncopies of a model for a same classification task. This process injects unique\ncharacteristics into each copy so that adversarial examples generated have\ndistinct and traceable features. We give a parallel structure which embeds a\n``tracer'' in each copy, and a noise-sensitive training loss to achieve this\ngoal. The tracing stage takes in adversarial examples and a few candidate\nmodels, and identifies the likely source.

    "abstract": "In inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), a learning agent infers a reward\nfunction encoding the underlying task using demonstrations from experts.\nHowever, many existing IRL techniques make the often unrealistic assumption\nthat the agent has access to full information about the environment. We remove\nthis assumption by developing an algorithm for IRL in partially observable\nMarkov decision processes (POMDPs). We address two limitations of existing IRL\ntechniques. First, they require an excessive amount of data due to the\ninformation asymmetry between the expert and the learner. Second, most of these\nIRL techniques require solving the computationally intractable forward problem\n-- computing an optimal policy given a reward function -- in POMDPs. The\ndeveloped algorithm reduces the information asymmetry while increasing the data\nefficiency by incorporating task specifications expressed in temporal logic\ninto IRL. Such specifications may be interpreted as side information available\nto the learner a priori in addition to the demonstrations. Further, the\nalgorithm avoids a common source of algorithmic complexity by building on\ncausal entropy as the measure of the likelihood of the demonstrations as\nopposed to entropy. Nevertheless, the resulting problem is nonconvex due to the\nso-called forward problem. We solve the intrinsic nonconvexity of the forward\nproblem in a scalable manner through a sequential linear programming scheme\nthat guarantees to converge to a locally optimal policy. In a series of\nexamples, including experiments in a high-fidelity Unity simulator, we\ndemonstrate that even with a limited amount of data and POMDPs with tens of\nthousands of states, our algorithm learns reward functions and policies that\nsatisfy the task while inducing similar behavior to the expert by leveraging\nthe provided side information.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a coding approach for achieving omnidirectional\ntransmission of certain common signals in massive multi-input multi-output\n(MIMO) networks such that the received power at any direction in a cell remains\nconstant for any given distance. Specifically, two-dimensional (2D) Golay\ncomplementary array set (GCAS) can be used to design optimal massive MIMO\nprecoding matrix so as to achieve omnidirectional transmission due to its\ncomplementary autocorrelation property. In this paper, novel constructions of\nnew 2D GCASs with arbitrary array lengths are proposed. Our key idea is to\ncarefully truncate the columns of certain larger arrays generated by 2D\ngeneralized Boolean functions. Finally, the power radiation patterns and\nnumerical results are provided to verify the omnidirectional property of the\nGCAS-based precoding. The error performances of the proposed precoding scheme\nare presented to validate its superiority over the existing alternatives.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs and ontologies are becoming increasingly important as\ntechnical solutions for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable data\nand metadata (FAIR Guiding Principles). We discuss four challenges that impede\nthe use of FAIR knowledge graphs and propose semantic units as their potential\nsolution. Semantic units structure a knowledge graph into identifiable and\nsemantically meaningful subgraphs. Each unit is represented by its own\nresource, instantiates a corresponding semantic unit class, and can be\nimplemented as a FAIR Digital Object and a nanopublication in RDF/OWL and\nproperty graphs. We distinguish statement and compound units as basic\ncategories of semantic units. Statement units represent smallest, independent\npropositions that are semantically meaningful for a human reader. They consist\nof one or more triples and mathematically partition a knowledge graph. We\ndistinguish assertional, contingent (prototypical), and universal statement\nunits as basic types of statement units and propose representational schemes\nand formal semantics for them (including for absence statements, negations, and\ncardinality restrictions) that do not involve blank nodes and that translate\nback to OWL. Compound units, on the other hand, represent semantically\nmeaningful collections of semantic units and we distinguish various types of\ncompound units, representing different levels of representational granularity,\ndifferent types of granularity trees, and different frames of reference.\nSemantic units support making statements about statements, can be used for\ngraph-alignment, subgraph-matching, knowledge graph profiling, and for managing\naccess restrictions to sensitive data. Organizing the graph into semantic units\nsupports the separation of ontological, diagnostic (i.e., referential), and\ndiscursive information, and it also supports the differentiation of multiple\nframes of reference.",

As such, researchers have committed\nconsiderable resources toward automating various tasks of the bug management\nprocess for mobile apps, such as reproduction and triaging. However, the\nsuccess of these automated approaches is largely dictated by the\ncharacteristics and properties of the bug reports they operate upon. As such,\nunderstanding mobile app bug reports is imperative to drive the continued\nadvancement of report management techniques. While prior studies have examined\nhigh-level statistics of large sets of reports, we currently lack an in-depth\ninvestigation of how the information typically reported in mobile app issue\ntrackers relates to the specific details generally required to reproduce the\nunderlying failures. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of 180\nreproducible bug reports systematically mined from Android apps on GitHub and\ninvestigate how the information contained in the reports relates to the task of\nreproducing the described bugs. In our analysis, we focus on three pieces of\ninformation: the environment needed to reproduce the bug report, the steps to\nreproduce (S2Rs), and the observed behavior. Focusing on this information, we\ncharacterize failure types, identify the modality used to report the\ninformation, and characterize the quality of the information within the\nreports. We find that bugs are reported in a multi-modal fashion, the\nenvironment is not always provided, and S2Rs often contain missing or\nnon-specific enough information. These findings carry with them important\nimplications on automated bug reproduction techniques as well as automated bug\nreport management approaches more generally.",

It reports two types of constrained motion: i) Bilateral\nConstrained Motion, also called Remote Center Motion (RCM), and ii)\nUnilaterally Constrained Motion (UCM). In the first case, the incision hole has\nalmost the same diameter as the robotic tool. In contrast, in the second state,\nthe diameter of the incision orifice is larger than the tool diameter. The\nsecond case offers more space where the surgical instrument moves freely\nwithout constraints before touching the incision wall.

The proposed methods and materials were tested first on\nour simulator that mimics realistic conditions of middle ear surgery, and then\non an experimental platform.

    "abstract": "While being decentralized, secure, and reliable, Bitcoin and many other\nblockchain-based cryptocurrencies suffer from scalability issues. One of the\npromising proposals to address this problem is off-chain payment channels.\nSince, not all nodes are connected directly to each other, they can use a\npayment network to route their payments. Each node allocates a balance that is\nfrozen during the channel's lifespan. Spending and receiving transactions will\nshift the balance to one side of the channel. A channel becomes unbalanced when\nthere is not sufficient balance in one direction. In this case, we say the\neffective lifespan of the channel has ended.\nIn this paper, we develop a mathematical model to predict the expected\neffective lifespan of a channel based on the network's topology. We investigate\nthe impact of channel unbalancing on the payment network and individual\nchannels. We also discuss the effect of certain characteristics of payment\nchannels on their lifespan. Our case study on a snapshot of the Lightning\nNetwork shows how the effective lifespan is distributed, and how it is\ncorrelated with other network characteristics. Our results show that central\nunbalanced channels have a drastic effect on the network performance.",

For\nthis aim, we propose a protocol of challenge-response using a memory chip. For\nthe central management, a central node controls the entry of electronic\nappliances with a memory chip into the network, and excludes a fake node (e.g.,\nthe spoofing entity) from the network that the central node manages. For the\ndecentralized communications, Merkle's tree turns out to be composed of memory\nchips to which the logical nodes are uniquely linked, respectively. The root of\nMerkle turns out to be the memory chip that stores the latest record of data\ntransactions. We can register this memory chip as a new block by satisfying the\nrequirement of the proof-of-consensus. After blocks are chained, it gets harder\nfor even the central node to manipulate transaction record among memory chips.\nBy this way, the decentralized system (e.g., blockchain) and the central\nmanagement can coexist.

One way to tackle this issue is to\nbenefit from the perception of different view points, namely cooperative\nperception. We propose here a decentralized collaboration, i.e. peer-to-peer,\nin which the agents are active in their quest for full perception by asking for\nspecific areas in their surroundings on which they would like to know more.\nUltimately, we want to optimize a trade-off between the maximization of\nknowledge about moving objects and the minimization of the total volume of\ninformation received from others, to limit communication costs and message\nprocessing time. For this, we propose a way to learn a communication policy\nthat reverses the usual communication paradigm by only requesting from other\nvehicles what is unknown to the ego-vehicle, instead of filtering on the sender\nside. We tested three different generative models to be taken as base for a\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm, and compared them to a\nbroadcasting policy and a policy randomly selecting areas. In particular, we\npropose Locally Predictable VAE (LP-VAE), which appears to be producing better\nbelief states for predictions than state-of-the-art models, both as a\nstandalone model and in the context of DRL. Experiments were conducted in the\ndriving simulator CARLA.

Global metrics such as betweenness centrality exploit\nthe information of the whole network structure at the cost of a very high\ncomputational complexity. Recent works have shown that combining multiple\nmetrics is a promising strategy to quantify the node's influential ability. Our\nwork is in this line. In this paper, we introduce a multi-attributes centrality\nmeasure called M-Centrality that combines the information on the position of\nthe node in the network with the local information on its nearest neighborhood.\nThe position is measured by the K-shell decomposition, and the degree variation\nin the neighborhood of the node quantifies the influence of the local context.\nIn order to examine the performances of the proposed measure, we conduct\nexperiments on small and large scale real-world networks from the perspectives\nof transmission dynamics and network connectivity. According to the empirical\nresults, the M-Centrality outperforms its alternatives in identifying both\ninfluential spreaders and nodes essential to maintain the network connectivity.\nIn addition, its low computational complexity makes it easily applied to large\nscale networks.",

To\nthis end, we introduce the Pseudo-Inverted Bottleneck conv block intending to\nreduce the computational footprint of the inverted bottleneck block proposed in\nConvNeXt. Our proposed architecture is much less sensitive to evaluation layer\ncount and outperforms a DARTS network with similar size significantly, at layer\ncounts as small as 2. Furthermore, with less layers, not only does it achieve\nhigher accuracy with lower GMACs and parameter count, GradCAM comparisons show\nthat our network is able to better detect distinctive features of target\nobjects compared to DARTS.",

    "abstract": "Masked image modeling (MIM) performs strongly in pre-training large vision\nTransformers (ViTs). However, small models that are critical for real-world\napplications cannot or only marginally benefit from this pre-training approach.\nIn this paper, we explore distillation techniques to transfer the success of\nlarge MIM-based pre-trained models to smaller ones. We systematically study\ndifferent options in the distillation framework, including distilling targets,\nlosses, input, network regularization, sequential distillation, etc, revealing\nthat: 1) Distilling token relations is more effective than CLS token- and\nfeature-based distillation; 2) An intermediate layer of the teacher network as\ntarget perform better than that using the last layer when the depth of the\nstudent mismatches that of the teacher; 3) Weak regularization is preferred;\netc. With these findings, we achieve significant fine-tuning accuracy\nimprovements over the scratch MIM pre-training on ImageNet-1K classification,\nusing all the ViT-Tiny, ViT-Small, and ViT-base models, with +4.2%/+2.4%/+1.4%\ngains, respectively. Our TinyMIM model of base size achieves 52.2 mIoU in AE20K\nsemantic segmentation, which is +4.1 higher than the MAE baseline. Our TinyMIM\nmodel of tiny size achieves 79.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K image\nclassification, which sets a new record for small vision models of the same\nsize and computation budget.

For\nthe inference attack, we quantify how $\\epsilon$ affects the estimation of the\ntrue ranking based on synthetic rankings. For the personalized ranking task, we\nconsider varying privacy preferences among users and quantify how their privacy\npreferences affect the consistency in estimating the optimal ranking function.\nExtensive numerical experiments are carried out to verify the theoretical\nresults and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed synthetic ranking\nalgorithm.",

This gives an unconditional\nproof that constant-depth quantum circuits can sample from distributions which\ncan't be reproduced by constant-depth bounded fan-in classical circuits, even\nup to additive error.\nThe distribution $D_n$ and classical circuit lower bounds are based on work\nof Viola, in which he shows a different (but related) distribution cannot be\nsampled from approximately by constant-depth bounded fan-in classical circuits.",

    "abstract": "Molecular Communications (MC) is a bio-inspired communication paradigm which\nuses molecules as information carriers, thereby requiring unconventional\ntransmitter/receiver architectures and modulation/detection techniques.\nPractical MC receivers (MC-Rxs) can be implemented based on field-effect\ntransistor biosensor (bioFET) architectures, where surface receptors reversibly\nreact with ligands, whose concentration encodes the information. The\ntime-varying concentration of ligand-bound receptors is then translated into\nelectrical signals via field-effect, which is used to decode the transmitted\ninformation. However, ligand-receptor interactions do not provide an ideal\nmolecular selectivity, as similar types of ligands, i.e., interferers,\nco-existing in the MC channel can interact with the same type of receptors,\nresulting in cross-talk. Overcoming this molecular cross-talk with time-domain\nsamples of the Rx's electrical output is not always attainable, especially when\nRx has no knowledge of the interferer statistics or it operates near\nsaturation. In this study, we propose a frequency-domain detection (FDD)\ntechnique for bioFET-based MC-Rxs, which exploits the difference in binding\nreaction rates of different types of ligands, reflected to the noise spectrum\nof the ligand-receptor binding fluctuations. We analytically derive the bit\nerror probability (BEP) of the FDD technique, and demonstrate its effectiveness\nin decoding transmitted concentration signals under stochastic molecular\ninterference, in comparison to a widely-used time-domain detection (TDD)\ntechnique. The proposed FDD method can be applied to any biosensor-based\nMC-Rxs, which employ receptor molecules as the channel-Rx interface.",

    "abstract": "In the past years, deep learning has seen an increase of usage in the domain\nof histopathological applications. However, while these approaches have shown\ngreat potential, in high-risk environments deep learning models need to be able\nto judge their own uncertainty and be able to reject inputs when there is a\nsignificant chance of misclassification. In this work, we conduct a rigorous\nevaluation of the most commonly used uncertainty and robustness methods for the\nclassification of Whole-Slide-Images under domain shift using the H\\&E stained\nCamelyon17 breast cancer dataset. Although it is known that histopathological\ndata can be subject to strong domain shift and label noise, to our knowledge\nthis is the first work that compares the most common methods for uncertainty\nestimation under these aspects. In our experiments, we compare Stochastic\nVariational Inference, Monte-Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensembles, Test-Time Data\nAugmentation as well as combinations thereof. We observe that ensembles of\nmethods generally lead to higher accuracies and better calibration and that\nTest-Time Data Augmentation can be a promising alternative when choosing an\nappropriate set of augmentations. Across methods, a rejection of the most\nuncertain tiles leads to a significant increase in classification accuracy on\nboth in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution data. Furthermore, we\nconduct experiments comparing these methods under varying conditions of label\nnoise. We observe that the border regions of the Camelyon17 dataset are subject\nto label noise and evaluate the robustness of the included methods against\ndifferent noise levels. Lastly, we publish our code framework to facilitate\nfurther research on uncertainty estimation on histopathological data.",

For the first time, we present a modification of the GI\nrule that can be used in experiments with exponentially-distributed rewards.

Compared\nto traditional non-adaptive designs, our novel GI modified design shows\noperating characteristics comparable in learning (e.g. statistical power) but\nsubstantially better in earning (e.g. direct benefits).

Recently, one-time\nuniversal hashing QDS framework, exploiting the quantum asymmetric encryption\nand universal hash functions, was proposed to significantly improve the\nsignature rate and ensure unconditional security by directly signing the hash\nvalue of long messages. However, similar to quantum key distribution, this\nframework utilizes keys with perfect secrecy via performing privacy\namplification that introduces huge matrix operations, thus consuming large\ncomputational resources, causing time delays and increasing failure\nprobability.

State-of-the-art bias correction methods only address errors in the\nsimulated frequency distributions locally, at every individual grid cell.\nImproving unrealistic spatial patterns of the ESM output, which would require\nspatial context, has not been possible so far. Here, we show that a\npost-processing method based on physically constrained generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs) can correct biases of a state-of-the-art, CMIP6-class ESM both\nin local frequency distributions and in the spatial patterns at once. While our\nmethod improves local frequency distributions equally well as gold-standard\nbias-adjustment frameworks it strongly outperforms any existing methods in the\ncorrection of spatial patterns, especially in terms of the characteristic\nspatial intermittency of precipitation extremes.",

    "abstract": "Recently, grant-free transmission paradigm has been introduced for massive\nInternet of Things (IoT) networks to save both time and bandwidth and transmit\nthe message with low latency. In order to accurately decode the message of each\ndevice at the base station (BS), first, the active devices at each transmission\nframe must be identified. In this work, first we investigate the problem of\nactivity detection as a threshold comparing problem. We show the convexity of\nthe activity detection method through analyzing its probability of error which\nmakes it possible to find the optimal threshold for minimizing the activity\ndetection error. Consequently, to achieve an optimum solution, we propose a\ndeep learning (DL)-based method called convolutional neural network\n(CNN)-activity detection (AD). In order to make it more practical, we consider\nunknown and time-varying activity rate for the IoT devices. Our simulations\nverify that our proposed CNN-AD method can achieve higher performance compared\nto the existing non-Bayesian greedy-based methods. This is while existing\nmethods need to know the activity rate of IoT devices, while our method works\nfor unknown and even time-varying activity rates",

We\nadopt a quasi-periodic conformal mapping formulation of the Euler equations,\nwhere one-dimensional quasi-periodic functions are represented by periodic\nfunctions on a higher-dimensional torus. We compute the time evolution of free\nsurface waves in the presence of a background flow and a quasi-periodic bottom\nboundary and observe the formation of quasi-periodic patterns on the free\nsurface. Two types of quasi-periodic traveling waves are computed:\nsmall-amplitude waves bifurcating from the zero-amplitude solution and\nlarger-amplitude waves bifurcating from finite-amplitude periodic traveling\nwaves. We derive weakly nonlinear approximations of the first type and\ninvestigate the associated small-divisor problem. We find that waves of the\nsecond type exhibit striking nonlinear behavior, e.g., the peaks and troughs\nare shifted non-periodically from the corresponding periodic waves due to the\nactivation of quasi-periodic modes.",

Besides, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are an alternative to\nHMMs and appear in the literature as different and somewhat concurrent models.\nWe propose two contributions. First, we show that basic Linear-Chain CRFs\n(LC-CRFs), considered as different from the HMMs, are in fact equivalent to\nthem in the sense that for each LC-CRF there exists a HMM - that we specify -\nwhom posterior distribution is identical to the given LC-CRF. Second, we show\nthat it is possible to reformulate the generative Bayesian classifiers Maximum\nPosterior Mode (MPM) and Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) used in HMMs, as\ndiscriminative ones. The last point is of importance in many fields, especially\nin Natural Language Processing (NLP), as it shows that in some situations\ndropping HMMs in favor of CRFs was not necessary.",
