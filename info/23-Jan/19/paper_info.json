    "abstract": "ChatGPT is not only fun to chat with, but it also searches information,\nanswers questions, and gives advice. With consistent moral advice, it might\nimprove the moral judgment and decisions of users, who often hold contradictory\nmoral beliefs. Unfortunately, ChatGPT turns out highly inconsistent as a moral\nadvisor. Nonetheless, it influences users' moral judgment, we find in an\nexperiment, even if they know they are advised by a chatting bot, and they\nunderestimate how much they are influenced. Thus, ChatGPT threatens to corrupt\nrather than improves users' judgment. These findings raise the question of how\nto ensure the responsible use of ChatGPT and similar AI. Transparency is often\ntouted but seems ineffective. We propose training to improve digital literacy.",

    "title": "EENet: Learning to Early Exit for Adaptive Inference",
    "abstract": "Budgeted adaptive inference with early exits is an emerging technique to\nimprove the computational efficiency of deep neural networks (DNNs) for edge AI\napplications with limited resources at test time. This method leverages the\nfact that different test data samples may not require the same amount of\ncomputation for a correct prediction. By allowing early exiting from full\nlayers of DNN inference for some test examples, we can reduce latency and\nimprove throughput of edge inference while preserving performance. Although\nthere have been numerous studies on designing specialized DNN architectures for\ntraining early-exit enabled DNN models, most of the existing work employ\nhand-tuned or manual rule-based early exit policies. In this study, we\nintroduce a novel multi-exit DNN inference framework, coined as EENet, which\nleverages multi-objective learning to optimize the early exit policy for a\ntrained multi-exit DNN under a given inference budget. This paper makes two\nnovel contributions. First, we introduce the concept of early exit utility\nscores by combining diverse confidence measures with class-wise prediction\nscores to better estimate the correctness of test-time predictions at a given\nexit. Second, we train a lightweight, budget-driven, multi-objective neural\nnetwork over validation predictions to learn the exit assignment scheduling for\nquery examples at test time. The EENet early exit scheduler optimizes both the\ndistribution of test samples to different exits and the selection of the exit\nutility thresholds such that the given inference budget is satisfied while the\nperformance metric is maximized. Extensive experiments are conducted on five\nbenchmarks, including three image datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet) and\ntwo NLP datasets (SST-2, AgNews). The results demonstrate the performance\nimprovements of EENet compared to existing representative early exit\ntechniques.",

    "abstract": "Physics-based optimization problems are generally very time-consuming,\nespecially due to the computational complexity associated with the forward\nmodel. Recent works have demonstrated that physics-modelling can be\napproximated with neural networks. However, there is always a certain degree of\nerror associated with this learning, and we study this aspect in this paper. We\ndemonstrate through experiments on popular mathematical benchmarks, that neural\nnetwork approximations (NN-proxies) of such functions when plugged into the\noptimization framework, can lead to erroneous results. In particular, we study\nthe behavior of particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm methods and\nanalyze their stability when coupled with NN-proxies. The correctness of the\napproximate model depends on the extent of sampling conducted in the parameter\nspace, and through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that caution needs to\nbe taken when constructing this landscape with neural networks. Further, the\nNN-proxies are hard to train for higher dimensional functions, and we present\nour insights for 4D and 10D problems. The error is higher for such cases, and\nwe demonstrate that it is sensitive to the choice of the sampling scheme used\nto build the NN-proxy.

Here, our\nobjective is to develop a deep learning model for a real-time, individualized,\nand interpretable mortality prediction model - AICare. Method and Materials:\nOur proposed model consists of a multi-channel feature extraction module and an\nadaptive feature importance recalibration module. AICare explicitly identifies\nthe key features that strongly indicate the outcome prediction for each patient\nto build the health status embedding individually. This study has collected\n13,091 clinical follow-up visits and demographic data of 656 PD patients. To\nverify the application universality, this study has also collected 4,789 visits\nof 1,363 hemodialysis dialysis (HD) as an additional experiment dataset to test\nthe prediction performance, which will be discussed in the Appendix.

In spite of this, traditional Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks lack the ability to explicitly\naccommodate policy heterogeneity, and typically constrain agents to share\nneural network parameters. This enforced homogeneity limits application in\ncases where the tasks benefit from heterogeneous behaviors. In this paper, we\ncrystallize the role of heterogeneity in MARL policies. Towards this end, we\nintroduce Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network Proximal Policy Optimization\n(HetGPPO), a paradigm for training heterogeneous MARL policies that leverages a\nGraph Neural Network for differentiable inter-agent communication. HetGPPO\nallows communicating agents to learn heterogeneous behaviors while enabling\nfully decentralized training in partially observable environments. We\ncomplement this with a taxonomical overview that exposes more heterogeneity\nclasses than previously identified. To motivate the need for our model, we\npresent a characterization of techniques that homogeneous models can leverage\nto emulate heterogeneous behavior, and show how this \"apparent heterogeneity\"\nis brittle in real-world conditions. Through simulations and real-world\nexperiments, we show that: (i) when homogeneous methods fail due to strong\nheterogeneous requirements, HetGPPO succeeds, and, (ii) when homogeneous\nmethods are able to learn apparently heterogeneous behaviors, HetGPPO achieves\nhigher resilience to both training and deployment noise.",

    "abstract": "Online abuse is becoming an increasingly prevalent issue in modern-day\nsociety, with 41 percent of Americans having experienced online harassment in\nsome capacity in 2021. People who identify as women, in particular, can be\nsubjected to a wide range of abusive behavior online, with gender-specific\nexperiences cited broadly in recent literature across fields such as blogging,\npolitics, and journalism. In response to this rise in abusive content,\nplatforms have been found to largely employ \"individualistic moderation\"\napproaches, aiming to protect users from harmful content through the screening\nand management of singular interactions or accounts. Yet, previous work\nperformed by the author of this paper has shown that in the cases of women in\nparticular, these approaches can often be ineffective; failing to protect users\nfrom multi-dimensional abuse spanning prolonged time periods, different\nplatforms, and varying interaction types. In recognition of its increasing\ncomplexity, platforms are beginning to outsource content moderation to users in\na new and decentralized approach. The goal of this research is to examine the\nfeasibility of using multidimensional abuse indicators in a Twitter-based\nmoderation algorithm aiming to protect women from female-targeted online abuse.\nThis research outlines three indicators of multidimensional abuse, explores how\nthese indicators can be extracted as features from Twitter data, and proposes a\ntechnical framework for deploying an end-to-end moderation algorithm using\nthese features.",

On social media platforms where individual communities moderate\ntheir own activities, the responsibility to address user appeals falls on\nvolunteers from within the community. While there is a growing body of work\ndevoted to understanding and supporting the volunteer moderators' workload,\nlittle is known about their practice of handling user appeals. Through a\ncollaborative and iterative design process with Reddit moderators, we found\nthat moderators spend considerable effort in investigating user ban appeals and\ndesired to directly engage with users and retain their agency over each\ndecision. To fulfill their needs, we designed and built AppealMod, a system\nthat asks users to put more effort in their appeals, by providing additional\ninformation, before their appeals are reviewed by human moderators. In addition\nto giving moderators more information, we expected the friction in the appeal\nprocess would lead to a selection effect among users, with many insincere and\ntoxic appeals being abandoned before getting any attention from human\nmoderators. To evaluate our system, we conducted a field experiment in a Reddit\ncommunity of over 29 million users that lasted for four months. As a result of\nthe selection effect, moderators viewed only 30\\% of initial appeals and less\nthan 10\\% of the toxically worded appeals; yet they granted roughly the same\nnumber of appeals. Overall, our system is effective at reducing moderator\nworkload and minimizing their exposure to toxic content while honoring their\npreference for direct engagement and agency in appeals.",

    "abstract": "In South Africa, it is a common practice for people to leave their vehicles\nbeside the road when traveling long distances for a short comfort break. This\npractice might increase human encounters with wildlife, threatening their\nsecurity and safety. Here we intend to create awareness about wildlife fencing,\nusing drone technology and computer vision algorithms to recognize and detect\nwildlife fences and associated features. We collected data at Amakhala and\nLalibela private game reserves in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. We used\nwildlife electric fence data containing single and double fences for the\nclassification task. Additionally, we used aerial and still annotated images\nextracted from the drone and still cameras for the segmentation and detection\ntasks. The model training results from the drone camera outperformed those from\nthe still camera. Generally, poor model performance is attributed to (1)\nover-decompression of images and (2) the ability of drone cameras to capture\nmore details on images for the machine learning model to learn as compared to\nstill cameras that capture only the front view of the wildlife fence. We argue\nthat our model can be deployed on client-edge devices to inform people about\nthe presence and significance of wildlife fencing, which minimizes human\nencounters with wildlife, thereby mitigating wildlife-vehicle collisions.",

    "title": "Artificial Neuronal Ensembles with Learned Context Dependent Gating",
    "abstract": "Biological neural networks are capable of recruiting different sets of\nneurons to encode different memories. However, when training artificial neural\nnetworks on a set of tasks, typically, no mechanism is employed for selectively\nproducing anything analogous to these neuronal ensembles. Further, artificial\nneural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where the network's\nperformance rapidly deteriorates as tasks are learned sequentially. By\ncontrast, sequential learning is possible for a range of biological organisms.\nWe introduce Learned Context Dependent Gating (LXDG), a method to flexibly\nallocate and recall `artificial neuronal ensembles', using a particular network\nstructure and a new set of regularization terms. Activities in the hidden\nlayers of the network are modulated by gates, which are dynamically produced\nduring training. The gates are outputs of networks themselves, trained with a\nsigmoid output activation. The regularization terms we have introduced\ncorrespond to properties exhibited by biological neuronal ensembles. The first\nterm penalizes low gate sparsity, ensuring that only a specified fraction of\nthe network is used. The second term ensures that previously learned gates are\nrecalled when the network is presented with input from previously learned\ntasks. Finally, there is a regularization term responsible for ensuring that\nnew tasks are encoded in gates that are as orthogonal as possible from\npreviously used ones. We demonstrate the ability of this method to alleviate\ncatastrophic forgetting on continual learning benchmarks. When the new\nregularization terms are included in the model along with Elastic Weight\nConsolidation (EWC) it achieves better performance on the benchmark `permuted\nMNIST' than with EWC alone. The benchmark `rotated MNIST' demonstrates how\nsimilar tasks recruit similar neurons to the artificial neuronal ensemble.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a growth in the number of industrial robots working\nclosely with end-users such as factory workers. This growing use of\ncollaborative robots has been enabled in part due to the availability of\nend-user robot programming methods that allow users who are not robot\nprogrammers to teach robots task actions. Programming by Demonstration (PbD) is\none such end-user programming method that enables users to bypass the\ncomplexities of specifying robot motions using programming languages by instead\ndemonstrating the desired robot behavior. Demonstrations are often provided by\nphysically guiding the robot through the motions required for a task action in\na process known as kinesthetic teaching. Kinesthetic teaching enables users to\ndirectly demonstrate task behaviors in the robot's configuration space, making\nit a popular end-user robot programming method for collaborative robots known\nfor its low cognitive burden. However, because kinesthetic teaching restricts\nthe programmer's teaching to motion demonstrations, it fails to leverage\ninformation from other modalities that humans naturally use when providing\nphysical task demonstrations to one other, such as gaze and speech.\nIncorporating multimodal information into the traditional kinesthetic\nprogramming workflow has the potential to enhance robot learning by\nhighlighting critical aspects of a program, reducing ambiguity, and improving\nsituational awareness for the robot learner and can provide insight into the\nhuman programmer's intent and difficulties. In this extended abstract, we\ndescribe a preliminary study on multimodal kinesthetic demonstrations and\nfuture directions for using multimodal demonstrations to enhance robot learning\nand user programming experiences.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided robotic systems offer great potential\nfor new minimally invasive medical tools, including MRI-powered miniature\nrobots. By re-purposing the imaging hardware of an MRI scanner, the magnetic\nminiature robot could be navigated into the remote part of the patient's body\nwithout needing tethered endoscopic tools. However, the state-of-art\nMRI-powered magnetic miniature robots have limited functionality besides\nnavigation. Here, we propose an MRI-powered magnetic miniature capsule robot\nbenefiting from acoustic streaming forces generated by MRI-guided\nhigh-intensity focus ultrasound (HIFU) for controlled drug release. Our design\ncomprises a polymer capsule shell with a submillimeter-diameter drug-release\nhole that captures an air bubble functioning as a stopper. We use the HIFU\npulse to initiate drug release by removing the air bubble once the capsule\nrobot reaches the target location. By controlling acoustic pressure, we also\nregulate the drug release rate for multiple location targeting during\nnavigation. We demonstrated that the proposed magnetic capsule robot could\ntravel at high speed up to 1.13 cm/s in ex vivo porcine small intestine and\nrelease drug to multiple target sites in a single operation, using a\ncombination of MRI-powered actuation and HIFU-controlled release.

Concurrently, to provide semantic\nunderstanding of the surgical area, recent advances have enabled\nmicroscope-integrated intraoperative Optical Coherent Tomography (iOCT) with\nhigh-resolution 3D imaging at near video rate. The combination of robotics and\nsemantic understanding enables task autonomy in robotic retinal surgery, such\nas for subretinal injection.

    "abstract": "Recovering full 3D shapes from partial observations is a challenging task\nthat has been extensively addressed in the computer vision community. Many deep\nlearning methods tackle this problem by training 3D shape generation networks\nto learn a prior over the full 3D shapes. In this training regime, the methods\nexpect the inputs to be in a fixed canonical form, without which they fail to\nlearn a valid prior over the 3D shapes. We propose SCARP, a model that performs\nShape Completion in ARbitrary Poses. Given a partial pointcloud of an object,\nSCARP learns a disentangled feature representation of pose and shape by relying\non rotationally equivariant pose features and geometric shape features trained\nusing a multi-tasking objective. Unlike existing methods that depend on an\nexternal canonicalization, SCARP performs canonicalization, pose estimation,\nand shape completion in a single network, improving the performance by 45% over\nthe existing baselines. In this work, we use SCARP for improving grasp\nproposals on tabletop objects.

    "abstract": "AI explanations are often mentioned as a way to improve human-AI\ndecision-making. Yet, empirical studies have not found consistent evidence of\nexplanations' effectiveness and, on the contrary, suggest that they can\nincrease overreliance when the AI system is wrong. While many factors may\naffect reliance on AI support, one important factor is how decision-makers\nreconcile their own intuition -- which may be based on domain knowledge, prior\ntask experience, or pattern recognition -- with the information provided by the\nAI system to determine when to override AI predictions. We conduct a\nthink-aloud, mixed-methods study with two explanation types (feature- and\nexample-based) for two prediction tasks to explore how decision-makers'\nintuition affects their use of AI predictions and explanations, and ultimately\ntheir choice of when to rely on AI. Our results identify three types of\nintuition involved in reasoning about AI predictions and explanations:\nintuition about the task outcome, features, and AI limitations. Building on\nthese, we summarize three observed pathways for decision-makers to apply their\nown intuition and override AI predictions. We use these pathways to explain why\n(1) the feature-based explanations we used did not improve participants'\ndecision outcomes and increased their overreliance on AI, and (2) the\nexample-based explanations we used improved decision-makers' performance over\nfeature-based explanations and helped achieve complementary human-AI\nperformance. Overall, our work identifies directions for further development of\nAI decision-support systems and explanation methods that help decision-makers\neffectively apply their intuition to achieve appropriate reliance on AI.",

    "abstract": "We consider additive Schwarz methods for fourth-order variational\ninequalities. While most existing works on Schwarz methods for fourth-order\nvariational inequalities deal with auxiliary linear problems instead of the\noriginal ones, we deal with the original ones directly by using a nonlinear\nsubspace correction framework for convex optimization. Based on a unified\nframework of various finite element methods for fourth-order variational\ninequalities, we develop one- and two-level additive Schwarz methods. We prove\nthat the two-level method is scalable in the sense that the convergence rate of\nthe method depends on $H/h$ and $H/\\delta$ only, where $h$ and $H$ are the\ntypical diameters of an element and a subdomain, respectively, and $\\delta$\nmeasures the overlap among the subdomains.

An efficient numerical method to solve coarse\nproblems in the two-level method is also presented. Our theoretical results are\nverified by numerical experiments.",

    "abstract": "Data-free quantization aims to achieve model quantization without accessing\nany authentic sample. It is significant in an application-oriented context\ninvolving data privacy. Converting noise vectors into synthetic samples through\na generator is a popular data-free quantization method, which is called\ngenerative data-free quantization. However, there is a difference in attention\nbetween synthetic samples and authentic samples. This is always ignored and\nrestricts the quantization performance. First, since synthetic samples of the\nsame class are prone to have homogenous attention, the quantized network can\nonly learn limited modes of attention. Second, synthetic samples in eval mode\nand training mode exhibit different attention. Hence, the batch-normalization\nstatistics matching tends to be inaccurate. ACQ is proposed in this paper to\nfix the attention of synthetic samples. An attention center position-condition\ngenerator is established regarding the homogenization of intra-class attention.\nRestricted by the attention center matching loss, the attention center position\nis treated as the generator's condition input to guide synthetic samples in\nobtaining diverse attention. Moreover, we design adversarial loss of paired\nsynthetic samples under the same condition to prevent the generator from paying\novermuch attention to the condition, which may result in mode collapse. To\nimprove the attention similarity of synthetic samples in different network\nmodes, we introduce a consistency penalty to guarantee accurate BN statistics\nmatching. The experimental results demonstrate that ACQ effectively improves\nthe attention problems of synthetic samples. Under various training settings,\nACQ achieves the best quantization performance. For the 4-bit quantization of\nResnet18 and Resnet50, ACQ reaches 67.55% and 72.23% accuracy, respectively.",

This makes previous attacks harder to\ninfer the continuous labels due to the unbounded output range. To address the\nlimitation, we propose a novel learning-based attack that integrates gradient\ninformation and extra learning regularization objectives in aspects of model\ntraining properties, which can infer the labels under regression settings\neffectively.

    "abstract": "In recent years, neural models learned through self-supervised pretraining on\nlarge scale multilingual text or speech data have exhibited promising results\nfor underresourced languages, especially when a relatively large amount of data\nfrom related language(s) is available. While the technology has a potential for\nfacilitating tasks carried out in language documentation projects, such as\nspeech transcription, pretraining a multilingual model from scratch for every\nnew language would be highly impractical. We investigate the possibility for\nadapting an existing multilingual wav2vec 2.0 model for a new language,\nfocusing on actual fieldwork data from a critically endangered tongue: Ainu.\nSpecifically, we (i) examine the feasibility of leveraging data from similar\nlanguages also in fine-tuning; (ii) verify whether the model's performance can\nbe improved by further pretraining on target language data. Our results show\nthat continued pretraining is the most effective method to adapt a wav2vec 2.0\nmodel for a new language and leads to considerable reduction in error rates.\nFurthermore, we find that if a model pretrained on a related speech variety or\nan unrelated language with similar phonological characteristics is available,\nmultilingual fine-tuning using additional data from that language can have\npositive impact on speech recognition performance when there is very little\nlabeled data in the target language.",

    "abstract": "In autonomous driving, 3D object detection based on multi-modal data has\nbecome an indispensable approach when facing complex environments around the\nvehicle. During multi-modal detection, LiDAR and camera are simultaneously\napplied for capturing and modeling. However, due to the intrinsic discrepancies\nbetween the LiDAR point and camera image, the fusion of the data for object\ndetection encounters a series of problems. Most multi-modal detection methods\nperform even worse than LiDAR-only methods. In this investigation, we propose a\nmethod named PTA-Det to improve the performance of multi-modal detection.\nAccompanied by PTA-Det, a Pseudo Point Cloud Generation Network is proposed,\nwhich can convert image information including texture and semantic features by\npseudo points. Thereafter, through a transformer-based Point Fusion Transition\n(PFT) module, the features of LiDAR points and pseudo points from image can be\ndeeply fused under a unified point-based representation. The combination of\nthese modules can conquer the major obstacle in feature fusion across\nmodalities and realizes a complementary and discriminative representation for\nproposal generation.

However, this has limitations $-$ 1) IL policies generalize poorly to\nnew states, since the training mimics actions not their consequences, and 2)\ncollecting demonstrations is expensive. On the other hand, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) is trivially scalable, but requires careful reward engineering to\nachieve desirable behavior. We present a two-stage learning scheme for IL\npretraining on human demonstrations followed by RL-finetuning. This leads to a\nPIRLNav policy that advances the state-of-the-art on ObjectNav from $60.0\\%$\nsuccess rate to $65.0\\%$ ($+5.0\\%$ absolute). Using this IL$\\rightarrow$RL\ntraining recipe, we present a rigorous empirical analysis of design choices.\nFirst, we investigate whether human demonstrations can be replaced with `free'\n(automatically generated) sources of demonstrations, e.g. shortest paths (SP)\nor task-agnostic frontier exploration (FE) trajectories.

    "abstract": "A thorough and systematic understanding of different elements of cyberattacks\nis essential for developing the necessary tools to prevent, detect, diagnose,\nand mitigate cyberattacks in manufacturing systems. In response, researchers\nhave proposed several attack taxonomies as methods for recognizing and\ncategorizing various cyberattack attributes. However, those taxonomies cover\nselected attack attributes depending on the research focus, sometimes\naccompanied by inconsistent naming and definitions. These seemingly different\ntaxonomies often overlap and can complement each other to create a\ncomprehensive knowledge base of cyberattack attributes that is currently\nmissing in the literature. Additionally, there is a missing link from creating\nstructured knowledge by using a taxonomy to applying this structure for\ncybersecurity tools development and aiding practitioners in using it. To tackle\nthese challenges, this article highlights how cyberattack taxonomies can be\nused to better understand and characterize manufacturing cybersecurity threats.\nIt also reviews and analyzes current taxonomical classifications of\nmanufacturing cybersecurity threat attributes and countermeasures, as well as\nthe proliferation of the scope and coverage in existing taxonomies. As a\nresult, these taxonomies are compiled into a more comprehensive and consistent\nmeta-taxonomy for the smart manufacturing space. The resulting meta-taxonomy\nprovides a holistic analysis of current taxonomies and integrates them into a\nunified structure. Based on this structure, this paper identifies gaps in\ncurrent attack taxonomies and provides directions for future improvements.\nFinally, the paper introduces potential use cases for attack taxonomies in\nsmart manufacturing systems for assessing security threats and their associated\nrisks, devising risk mitigation strategies, and informing the application of\ncybersecurity frameworks.",

Third, the\nproposed method identifies the attack path that maximizes the likelihood of\nsuccess and minimizes the attack detection probability, and then computes the\nassociated cybersecurity risk. Finally, the proposed risk modeling and\nassessment framework is demonstrated via an interconnected smart manufacturing\nsystem illustrative example.

    "abstract": "Robust loss minimization is an important strategy for handling robust\nlearning issue on noisy labels. Current robust losses, however, inevitably\ninvolve hyperparameters to be tuned for different datasets with noisy labels,\nmanually or heuristically through cross validation, which makes them fairly\nhard to be generally applied in practice. Existing robust loss methods usually\nassume that all training samples share common hyperparameters, which are\nindependent of instances. This limits the ability of these methods on\ndistinguishing individual noise properties of different samples, making them\nhardly adapt to different noise structures. To address above issues, we propose\nto assemble robust loss with instance-dependent hyperparameters to improve\ntheir noise-tolerance with theoretical guarantee. To achieve setting such\ninstance-dependent hyperparameters for robust loss, we propose a meta-learning\nmethod capable of adaptively learning a hyperparameter prediction function,\ncalled Noise-Aware-Robust-Loss-Adjuster (NARL-Adjuster). Specifically, through\nmutual amelioration between hyperparameter prediction function and classifier\nparameters in our method, both of them can be simultaneously finely ameliorated\nand coordinated to attain solutions with good generalization capability. Four\nkinds of SOTA robust losses are attempted to be integrated with our algorithm,\nand experiments substantiate the general availability and effectiveness of the\nproposed method in both its noise tolerance and generalization performance.\nMeanwhile, the explicit parameterized structure makes the meta-learned\nprediction function capable of being readily transferrable and plug-and-play to\nunseen datasets with noisy labels. Specifically, we transfer our meta-learned\nNARL-Adjuster to unseen tasks, including several real noisy datasets, and\nachieve better performance compared with conventional hyperparameter tuning\nstrategy.",

    "abstract": "In modern networking research, infrastructure-assisted unmanned autonomous\nvehicles (UAVs) are actively considered for real-time learning-based\nsurveillance and aerial data-delivery under unexpected 3D free mobility and\ncoordination. In this system model, it is essential to consider the power\nlimitation in UAVs and autonomous object recognition (for abnormal behavior\ndetection) deep learning model performance in infrastructure/towers. To\novercome the power limitation of UAVs, this paper proposes a novel aerial\nscheduling algorithm between multi-UAVs and multi-towers where the towers\nconduct wireless power transfer toward UAVs. In addition, to take care of the\nhigh-performance learning model training in towers, the training data from UAVs\nshould be fairly delivered to towers because larger data delivery will make\nhuge computation overhead whereas the less data delivery will introduce\noverfitting. Therefore, fair data distribution from UAVs to their associated\ntowers is essentially required. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel\nworkload-aware scheduling algorithm between multi-towers and multi-UAVs for\njoint power-charging from towers to their associated UAVs and training data\ndelivery from UAVs to their associated towers. For computing the workload-aware\noptimal scheduling decisions in each unit time, our solution approach for the\ngiven scheduling problem is designed based on Markov decision process (MDP) to\ndeal with (i) time-varying low-complexity computation and (ii)\npseudo-polynomial optimality. As shown in performance evaluation results, our\nproposed algorithm ensures (i) sufficient times for resource exchanges between\ntowers and UAVs, (ii) the most even and uniform data collection during the\nprocesses compared to the other algorithms, and (iii) the performance of all\ntowers converges to optimal levels.",

HSTFormer consists of four transformer encoders (TEs) and a fusion module.\nTo the best of our knowledge, HSTFormer is the first to study hierarchical TEs\nwith multi-level fusion. Extensive experiments on three datasets (i.e.,\nHuman3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and HumanEva) demonstrate that HSTFormer achieves\ncompetitive and consistent performance on benchmarks with various scales and\ndifficulties. Specifically, it surpasses recent SOTAs on the challenging\nMPI-INF-3DHP dataset and small-scale HumanEva dataset, with a highly\ngeneralized systematic approach.

    "abstract": "Advances in Single-vehicle intelligence of automated driving have encountered\nsignificant challenges because of limited capabilities in perception and\ninteraction with complex traffic environments. Cooperative Driving\nAutomation~(CDA) has been considered a pivotal solution to next-generation\nautomated driving and intelligent transportation. Though CDA has attracted much\nattention from both academia and industry, exploration of its potential is\nstill in its infancy. In industry, companies tend to build their in-house data\ncollection pipeline and research tools to tailor their needs and protect\nintellectual properties. Reinventing the wheels, however, wastes resources and\nlimits the generalizability of the developed approaches since no standardized\nbenchmarks exist. On the other hand, in academia, due to the absence of\nreal-world traffic data and computation resources, researchers often\ninvestigate CDA topics in simplified and mostly simulated environments,\nrestricting the possibility of scaling the research outputs to real-world\nscenarios. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish an open-source\necosystem~(OSE) to address the demands of different communities for CDA\nresearch, particularly in the early exploratory research stages, and provide\nthe bridge to ensure an integrated development and testing pipeline that\ndiverse communities can share. In this paper, we introduce the OpenCDA research\necosystem, a unified OSE integrated with a model zoo, a suite of driving\nsimulators at various resolutions, large-scale real-world and simulated\ndatasets, complete development toolkits for benchmark training/testing, and a\nscenario database/generator. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of OpenCDA\nOSE through example use cases, including cooperative 3D LiDAR detection,\ncooperative merge, cooperative camera-based map prediction, and adversarial\nscenario generation.",

    "abstract": "Deblurring can not only provide visually more pleasant pictures and make\nphotography more convenient, but also can improve the performance of objection\ndetection as well as tracking. However, removing dynamic scene blur from images\nis a non-trivial task as it is difficult to model the non-uniform blur\nmathematically. Several methods first use single or multiple images to estimate\noptical flow (which is treated as an approximation of blur kernels) and then\nadopt non-blind deblurring algorithms to reconstruct the sharp images. However,\nthese methods cannot be trained in an end-to-end manner and are usually\ncomputationally expensive. In this paper, we explore optical flow to remove\ndynamic scene blur by using the multi-scale spatially variant recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN). We utilize FlowNets to estimate optical flow from two\nconsecutive images in different scales. The estimated optical flow provides the\nRNN weights in different scales so that the weights can better help RNNs to\nremove blur in the feature spaces. Finally, we develop a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) to restore the sharp images from the deblurred features. Both\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations on the benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms\nin terms of accuracy, speed, and model size.",

    "abstract": "Recent mask proposal models have significantly improved the performance of\nzero-shot semantic segmentation. However, the use of a `background' embedding\nduring training in these methods is problematic as the resulting model tends to\nover-learn and assign all unseen classes as the background class instead of\ntheir correct labels. Furthermore, they ignore the semantic relationship of\ntext embeddings, which arguably can be highly informative for zero-shot\nprediction as seen classes may have close relationship with unseen classes. To\nthis end, this paper proposes novel class enhancement losses to bypass the use\nof the background embbedding during training, and simultaneously exploit the\nsemantic relationship between text embeddings and mask proposals by ranking the\nsimilarity scores. To further capture the relationship between seen and unseen\nclasses, we propose an effective pseudo label generation pipeline using\npretrained vision-language model. Extensive experiments on several benchmark\ndatasets show that our method achieves overall the best performance for\nzero-shot semantic segmentation. Our method is flexible, and can also be\napplied to the challenging open-vocabulary semantic segmentation problem.",

    "abstract": "Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation aims at training the segmentation model\nwith limited labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. To effectively\nleverage the unlabeled data, pseudo labeling, along with the teacher-student\nframework, is widely adopted in semi-supervised semantic segmentation. Though\nproved to be effective, this paradigm suffers from incorrect pseudo labels\nwhich inevitably exist and are taken as auxiliary training data. To alleviate\nthe negative impact of incorrect pseudo labels, we delve into the current\nSemi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation frameworks. We argue that the unlabeled\ndata with pseudo labels can facilitate the learning of representative features\nin the feature extractor, but it is unreliable to supervise the mask predictor.\nMotivated by this consideration, we propose a novel framework, Gentle Teaching\nAssistant (GTA-Seg) to disentangle the effects of pseudo labels on feature\nextractor and mask predictor of the student model. Specifically, in addition to\nthe original teacher-student framework, our method introduces a teaching\nassistant network which directly learns from pseudo labels generated by the\nteacher network. The gentle teaching assistant (GTA) is coined gentle since it\nonly transfers the beneficial feature representation knowledge in the feature\nextractor to the student model in an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) manner,\nprotecting the student model from the negative influences caused by unreliable\npseudo labels in the mask predictor. The student model is also supervised by\nreliable labeled data to train an accurate mask predictor, further facilitating\nfeature representation.

The DST-USERS task is much more challenging since it\nrequires the model to understand and track dialogue states in the dialogue\nbetween users and to understand who suggested the schedule and who agreed to\nthe proposed schedule. To facilitate DST-USERS research, we develop dialogue\ndatasets between users that plan a schedule. The annotated slot values which\nneed to be extracted in the dialogue are date, time, and location. Previous\napproaches, such as Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) and traditional DST\ntechniques, have not achieved good results in our extensive evaluations.

Their results highlight that current security\nsolutions that adopt a one-size-fits-all-users approach ignore the differences\nand needs of particular user communities. However, those works focus on a\nsingle community or cluster users into hard-to-interpret sub-populations.\nIn this work, we perform a large-scale quantitative analysis of the risk of\nencountering malware and other potentially unwanted applications (PUA) across\nuser communities. At the core of our study is a dataset of app installation\nlogs collected from 12M Android mobile devices. Leveraging user-installed apps,\nwe define intuitive profiles based on users' interests (e.g., gamers and\ninvestors), and fit a subset of 5.4M devices to those profiles. Our analysis is\nstructured in three parts. First, we perform risk analysis on the whole\npopulation to measure how the risk of malicious app encounters is affected by\ndifferent factors. Next, we create different profiles to investigate whether\nrisk differences across users may be due to their interests. Finally, we\ncompare a per-profile approach for classifying clean and infected devices with\nthe classical approach that considers the whole population.\nWe observe that features such as the diversity of the app signers and the use\nof alternative markets highly correlate with the risk of malicious app\nencounters. We also discover that some profiles such as gamers and social-media\nusers are exposed to more than twice the risks experienced by the average\nusers. We also show that the classification outcome has a marked accuracy\nimprovement when using a per-profile approach to train the prediction models.\nOverall, our results confirm the inadequacy of one-size-fits-all protection\nsolutions.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning has attracted increasing attention as it learns\ndata-driven representation from data without annotations. Vision\ntransformer-based autoencoder (ViT-AE) by He et al. (2021) is a recent\nself-supervised learning technique that employs a patch-masking strategy to\nlearn a meaningful latent space. In this paper, we focus on improving ViT-AE\n(nicknamed ViT-AE++) for a more effective representation of both 2D and 3D\nmedical images. We propose two new loss functions to enhance the representation\nduring the training stage. The first loss term aims to improve\nself-reconstruction by considering the structured dependencies and hence\nindirectly improving the representation.

    "abstract": "A sliding-window algorithm of window size $t$ is an algorithm whose current\noperation depends solely on the last $t$ symbols read. We construct\npseudorandom generators (PRGs) for low-space randomized sliding-window\nalgorithms that have access to a binary randomness source. More specifically,\nwe lift these algorithms to the non-uniform setting of branching programs and\nstudy them as a subclass thereof that we call sliding-window branching programs\n(SWBPs), accordingly. For general SWBPs, given a base PRG $G_\\mathrm{base}$\nwith seed length $d_\\mathrm{base}$ that $\\varepsilon_\\mathrm{base}$-fools\nwidth-$w$, length-$t$ (general) branching programs, we give two PRG\nconstructions for fooling any same-width SWBP of length $n$ and window size $t$\n(where we assume $w \\ge n$). The first uses an additional $d_\\mathrm{base} +\nO(\\log(n/t) \\log(1/\\varepsilon_\\mathrm{base}))$ random bits, whereas the second\nhas a seed length of $O((d_\\mathrm{base} + \\log\\log(n/t) +\n\\log(1/\\varepsilon_\\mathrm{base})) \\log(d_\\mathrm{base} +\n\\log(1/\\varepsilon_\\mathrm{base})))$. Both PRGs incur only a $(n/2t)^{O(1)}$\nmultiplicative loss in the error parameter.\nAs an application, we show how to decide the language of a sublinear-time\nprobabilistic cellular automaton using small space. More specifically, these\nresults target the model of PACAs, which are probabilistic cellular automata\nthat accept if and only if all cells are simultaneously accepting. For\n(sublinear) $T(n) = \\Omega(\\log n)^{1.01}$, we prove that every language\naccepted by a $T$-time one-sided error PACA (the PACA equivalent of\n$\\mathsf{RP}$) can be decided using only $O(T)$ space. Meanwhile, forgoing the\nprevious requirement on $T$, we show the same holds for $T$-time two-sided\nerror PACA (the PACA equivalent of $\\mathsf{BPP}$) if we use $\\tilde{O}(T) +\nO(\\log n)$ space instead (where the $\\tilde{O}$ notation hides only\n$\\mathsf{polylog}(T)$ factors).",

    "abstract": "Background and Objective: Pelvic floor disorders are prevalent diseases and\npatient care remains difficult as the dynamics of the pelvic floor remains\npoorly known. So far, only 2D dynamic observations of straining exercises at\nexcretion are available in the clinics and the understanding of\nthree-dimensional pelvic organs mechanical defects is not yet achievable. In\nthis context, we proposed a complete methodology for the 3D representation of\nthe non-reversible bladder deformations during exercises, directly combined\nwith synthesized 3D representation of the location of the highest strain areas\non the organ surface. Methods: Novel image segmentation and registration\napproaches have been combined with three geometrical configurations of\nup-to-date rapid dynamic multi-slices MRI acquisition for the reconstruction of\nreal-time dynamic bladder volumes. Results: For the first time, we proposed\nreal-time 3D deformation fields of the bladder under strain from in-bore forced\nbreathing exercises. The potential of our method was assessed on eight control\nsubjects undergoing forced breathing exercises. We obtained average volume\ndeviation of the reconstructed dynamic volume of bladders around 2.5\\% and high\nregistration accuracy with mean distance values of 0.4 $\\pm$ 0.3 mm and\nHausdorff distance values of 2.2 $\\pm$ 1.1 mm. Conclusions: Immediately\ntransferable to the clinics with rapid acquisitions, the proposed framework\nrepresents a real advance in the field of pelvic floor disorders as it\nprovides, for the first time, a proper 3D+t spatial tracking of bladder\nnon-reversible deformations. This work is intended to be extended to patients\nwith cavities filling and excretion to better characterize the degree of\nseverity of pelvic floor pathologies for diagnostic assistance or in\npreoperative surgical planning.",

    "abstract": "Complex IoT ecosystems often require the usage of Digital Twins (DTs) of\ntheir physical assets in order to perform predictive analytics and simulate\nwhat-if scenarios. DTs are able to replicate IoT devices and adapt over time to\ntheir behavioral changes. However, DTs in IoT are typically tailored to a\nspecific use case, without the possibility to seamlessly adapt to different\nscenarios. Further, the fragmentation of IoT poses additional challenges on how\nto deploy DTs in heterogeneous scenarios characterized by the usage of multiple\ndata formats and IoT network protocols. In this paper, we propose the\nRelativistic Digital Twin (RDT) framework, through which we automatically\ngenerate general purpose DTs of IoT entities and tune their behavioral models\nover time by constantly observing their real counterparts. The framework relies\non the object representation via the Web of Things (WoT), to offer a\nstandardized interface to each of the IoT devices as well as to their DTs. To\nthis purpose, we extended the W3C WoT standard in order to encompass the\nconcept of behavioral model and define it in the Thing Description (TD) through\na new vocabulary. Finally, we evaluated the RDT framework over two disjoint use\ncases to assess its correctness and learning performance, i.e. the DT of a\nsimulated smart home scenario with the capability of forecasting the indoor\ntemperature, and the DT of a real-world drone with the capability of\nforecasting its trajectory in an outdoor scenario.",

    "abstract": "RGB-D saliency detection aims to fuse multi-modal cues to accurately localize\nsalient regions. Existing works often adopt attention modules for feature\nmodeling, with few methods explicitly leveraging fine-grained details to merge\nwith semantic cues. Thus, despite the auxiliary depth information, it is still\nchallenging for existing models to distinguish objects with similar appearances\nbut at distinct camera distances. In this paper, from a new perspective, we\npropose a novel Hierarchical Depth Awareness network (HiDAnet) for RGB-D\nsaliency detection. Our motivation comes from the observation that the\nmulti-granularity properties of geometric priors correlate well with the neural\nnetwork hierarchies. To realize multi-modal and multi-level fusion, we first\nuse a granularity-based attention scheme to strengthen the discriminatory power\nof RGB and depth features separately. Then we introduce a unified cross\ndual-attention module for multi-modal and multi-level fusion in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner. The encoded multi-modal features are gradually\naggregated into a shared decoder. Further, we exploit a multi-scale loss to\ntake full advantage of the hierarchical information. Extensive experiments on\nchallenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that our HiDAnet performs favorably\nover the state-of-the-art methods by large margins.",

    "title": "Representing Noisy Image Without Denoising",
    "abstract": "A long-standing topic in artificial intelligence is the effective recognition\nof patterns from noisy images. In this regard, the recent data-driven paradigm\nconsiders 1) improving the representation robustness by adding noisy samples in\ntraining phase (i.e., data augmentation) or 2) pre-processing the noisy image\nby learning to solve the inverse problem (i.e., image denoising). However, such\nmethods generally exhibit inefficient process and unstable result, limiting\ntheir practical applications. In this paper, we explore a non-learning paradigm\nthat aims to derive robust representation directly from noisy images, without\nthe denoising as pre-processing. Here, the noise-robust representation is\ndesigned as Fractional-order Moments in Radon space (FMR), with also beneficial\nproperties of orthogonality and rotation invariance. Unlike earlier\ninteger-order methods, our work is a more generic design taking such classical\nmethods as special cases, and the introduced fractional-order parameter offers\ntime-frequency analysis capability that is not available in classical methods.\nFormally, both implicit and explicit paths for constructing the FMR are\ndiscussed in detail. Extensive simulation experiments and an image security\napplication are provided to demonstrate the uniqueness and usefulness of our\nFMR, especially for noise robustness, rotation invariance, and time-frequency\ndiscriminability.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a drive train topology with a dynamically reconfigurable\ndc battery, which breaks hard-wired batteries into smaller subunits. It can\nrapidly control the output voltage and even contribute to voltage shaping of\nthe inverter. Based upon the rapid development of low-voltage transistors and\nmodular circuit topologies in the recent years, the proposed technology uses\nrecent 48 V power electronics to achieve higher-voltage output and reduce\nlosses in electric vehicle (EV) drive trains. The fast switching capability and\nlow loss of low-voltage field effect transistors (FET) allow sharing the\nmodulation with the main drive inverter. As such, the slower insulated-gate\nbipolar transistors (IGBT) of the inverter can operate at ideal duty cycle and\naggressively reduced switching, while the adaptive dc battery provides an\nadjustable voltage and all common-mode contributions at the dc link with lower\nloss. Up to 2/3 of the switching of the main inverter is avoided. At high drive\nspeeds and thus large modulation indices, the proposed converter halves the\ntotal loss compared to using the inverter alone; at lower speeds and thus\nsmaller modulation indices, the advantage is even more prominent because of the\ndynamically lowered dc-link voltage. Furthermore, it can substantially reduce\nthe distortion, particularly at lower modulation indices, e.g., down to 1/2\ncompared to conventional space-vector modulation and even 1/3 for discontinuous\npulse-width modulation with hard-wired battery. Other benefits include\nalleviated insulation stress for motor windings, active battery balancing, and\neliminating the vulnerability of large hard-wired battery packs to weak cells.\nWe demonstrate the proposed motor drive on a 3-kW setup with eight battery\nmodules.",

Results show that the CNN\nmodel can mimic the drivers' behavior with an R2-squared of 0.83.

    "abstract": "Synthetic data generation has been widely adopted in software testing, data\nprivacy, imbalanced learning, and artificial intelligence explanation. In all\nsuch contexts, it is crucial to generate plausible data samples. A common\nassumption of approaches widely used for data generation is the independence of\nthe features. However, typically, the variables of a dataset depend on one\nanother, and these dependencies are not considered in data generation leading\nto the creation of implausible records. The main problem is that dependencies\namong variables are typically unknown. In this paper, we design a synthetic\ndataset generator for tabular data that can discover nonlinear causalities\namong the variables and use them at generation time. State-of-the-art methods\nfor nonlinear causal discovery are typically inefficient. We boost them by\nrestricting the causal discovery among the features appearing in the frequent\npatterns efficiently retrieved by a pattern mining algorithm. We design a\nframework for generating synthetic datasets with known causalities to validate\nour proposal. Broad experimentation on many synthetic and real datasets with\nknown causalities shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

When choosing an avoidance algorithm, many different options are\navailable, each with their advantages and disadvantages. As there is currently\nno consensus on testing methods, it is quite challenging to compare the\nperformance between algorithms. In this paper, we propose AvoidBench, a\nbenchmarking suite which can evaluate the performance of vision-based obstacle\navoidance algorithms by subjecting them to a series of tasks. Thanks to the\nhigh fidelity of multi-rotors dynamics from RotorS and virtual scenes of\nUnity3D, AvoidBench can realize realistic simulated flight experiments.\nCompared to current drone simulators, we propose and implement both performance\nand environment metrics to reveal the suitability of obstacle avoidance\nalgorithms for environments of different complexity. To illustrate AvoidBench's\nusage, we compare three algorithms: Ego-planner, MBPlanner, and Agile-autonomy.\nThe trends observed are validated with real-world obstacle avoidance\nexperiments.",

    "abstract": "Current methods aggregate multi-level features or introduce edge and skeleton\nto get more refined saliency maps. However, little attention is paid to how to\nobtain the complete salient object in cluttered background, where the targets\nare usually similar in color and texture to the background. To handle this\ncomplex scene, we propose a sharp eyes network (SENet) that first seperates the\nobject from scene, and then finely segments it, which is in line with human\nvisual characteristics, i.e., to look first and then focus. Different from\nprevious methods which directly integrate edge or skeleton to supplement the\ndefects of objects, the proposed method aims to utilize the expanded objects to\nguide the network obtain complete prediction. Specifically, SENet mainly\nconsists of target separation (TS) brach and object segmentation (OS) branch\ntrained by minimizing a new hierarchical difference aware (HDA) loss. In the TS\nbranch, we construct a fractal structure to produce saliency features with\nexpanded boundary via the supervision of expanded ground truth, which can\nenlarge the detail difference between foreground and background. In the OS\nbranch, we first aggregate multi-level features to adaptively select\ncomplementary components, and then feed the saliency features with expanded\nboundary into aggregated features to guide the network obtain complete\nprediction. Moreover, we propose the HDA loss to further improve the structural\nintegrity and local details of the salient objects, which assigns weight to\neach pixel according to its distance from the boundary hierarchically. Hard\npixels with similar appearance in border region will be given more attention\nhierarchically to emphasize their importance in completeness prediction.\nComprehensive experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively\nand qualitatively.",

Previous dominant works mainly adopt\ncontrastive learning to achieve global feature alignment across modalities.\nHowever, the local associations between videos and texts are not modeled,\nrestricting the pre-training models' generality, especially for tasks requiring\nthe temporal video boundary for certain query texts. This work introduces a\nnovel text-video localization pre-text task to enable fine-grained temporal and\nsemantic alignment such that the trained model can accurately perceive temporal\nboundaries in videos given the text description. Specifically, text-video\nlocalization consists of moment retrieval, which predicts start and end\nboundaries in videos given the text description, and text localization which\nmatches the subset of texts with the video features. To produce temporal\nboundaries, frame features in several videos are manually merged into a long\nvideo sequence that interacts with a text sequence. With the localization task,\nour method connects the fine-grained frame representations with the word\nrepresentations and implicitly distinguishes representations of different\ninstances in the single modality.

    "abstract": "A key performance bottleneck when training graph neural network (GNN) models\non large, real-world graphs is loading node features onto a GPU. Due to limited\nGPU memory, expensive data movement is necessary to facilitate the storage of\nthese features on alternative devices with slower access (e.g. CPU memory).\nMoreover, the irregularity of graph structures contributes to poor data\nlocality which further exacerbates the problem. Consequently, existing\nframeworks capable of efficiently training large GNN models usually incur a\nsignificant accuracy degradation because of the inevitable shortcuts involved.\nTo address these limitations, we instead propose ReFresh, a general-purpose GNN\nmini-batch training framework that leverages a historical cache for storing and\nreusing GNN node embeddings instead of re-computing them through fetching raw\nfeatures at every iteration. Critical to its success, the corresponding cache\npolicy is designed, using a combination of gradient-based and staleness\ncriteria, to selectively screen those embeddings which are relatively stable\nand can be cached, from those that need to be re-computed to reduce estimation\nerrors and subsequent downstream accuracy loss. When paired with complementary\nsystem enhancements to support this selective historical cache, ReFresh is able\nto accelerate the training speed on large graph datasets such as\nogbn-papers100M and MAG240M by 4.6x up to 23.6x and reduce the memory access by\n64.5% (85.7% higher than a raw feature cache), with less than 1% influence on\ntest accuracy.",

    "title": "Exposing Reliability Degradation and Mitigation in Approximate DNNs  under Permanent Faults",
    "abstract": "Approximate computing is known for enhancing deep neural network\naccelerators' energy efficiency by introducing inexactness with a tolerable\naccuracy loss. However, small accuracy variations may increase the sensitivity\nof these accelerators towards undesired subtle disturbances, such as permanent\nfaults. The impact of permanent faults in accurate deep neural network (AccDNN)\naccelerators has been thoroughly investigated in the literature. Conversely,\nthe impact of permanent faults and their mitigation in approximate DNN (AxDNN)\naccelerators is vastly under-explored. Towards this, we first present an\nextensive fault resilience analysis of approximate multi-layer perceptrons\n(MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using the state-of-the-art\nEvoapprox8b multipliers in GPU and TPU accelerators. Then, we propose a novel\nfault mitigation method, i.e., fault-aware retuning of weights (Fal-reTune).\nFal-reTune retunes the weights using a weight mapping function in the presence\nof faults for improved classification accuracy. To evaluate the fault\nresilience and the effectiveness of our proposed mitigation method, we used the\nmost widely used MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets. Our results\ndemonstrate that the permanent faults exacerbate the accuracy loss in AxDNNs\ncompared to the AccDNN accelerators. For instance, a permanent fault in AxDNNs\ncan lead to 56\\% accuracy loss, whereas the same faulty bit can lead to only\n4\\% accuracy loss in AccDNN accelerators. We empirically show that our proposed\nFal-reTune mitigation method improves the performance of AxDNNs up to 98%, even\nwith fault rates of up to 50%. Furthermore, we observe that the fault\nresilience in AxDNNs is orthogonal to their energy efficiency.",

A particularly interesting property highlighted by our research,\nwhich is also characteristic of this class of generative models, is the\nindependence of the latent representation from the networks implementing the\nreverse diffusion process.

    "abstract": "The rise of data-intensive applications exposed the limitations of\nconventional processor-centric von-Neumann architectures that struggle to meet\nthe off-chip memory bandwidth demand. Therefore, recent innovations in computer\narchitecture advocate compute-in-memory (CIM) and compute-near-memory (CNM),\nnon-von- Neumann paradigms achieving orders-of-magnitude improvements in\nperformance and energy consumption. Despite significant technological\nbreakthroughs in the last few years, the programmability of these systems is\nstill a serious challenge. Their programming models are too low-level and\nspecific to particular system implementations. Since such future architectures\nare predicted to be highly heterogenous, developing novel compiler abstractions\nand frameworks become necessary. To this end, we present CINM (Cinnamon), a\nfirst end-to-end compilation flow that leverages the hierarchal abstractions to\ngeneralize over different CIM and CNM devices and enable device-agnostic and\ndevice-aware optimizations. Cinnamon progressively lowers input programs and\nperforms optimizations at each level in the lowering pipeline. To show its\nefficacy, we evaluate CINM on a set of benchmarks for the well-known UPMEM CNM\nsystem and the memristors-based CIM accelerators. We show that Cinnamon,\nsupporting multiple hardware targets, generates high-performance code\ncomparable to or better than state-of-the-art implementations.",

One of\nthe major challenges in text-to-SQL parsing is domain generalization, i.e., how\nto generalize well to unseen databases.

    "title": "Site-specific weed management in corn using UAS imagery analysis and  computer vision techniques",
    "abstract": "Currently, weed control in commercial corn production is performed without\nconsidering weed distribution information in the field. This kind of weed\nmanagement practice leads to excessive amounts of chemical herbicides being\napplied in a given field. The objective of this study was to perform\nsite-specific weed control (SSWC) in a corn field by 1) using an unmanned\naerial system (UAS) to map the spatial distribution information of weeds in the\nfield; 2) creating a prescription map based on the weed distribution map, and\n3) spraying the field using the prescription map and a commercial size sprayer.\nIn this study, we are proposing a Crop Row Identification (CRI) algorithm, a\ncomputer vision algorithm that identifies corn rows on UAS imagery. After being\nidentified, the corn rows were then removed from the imagery and the remaining\nvegetation fraction was classified as weeds. Based on that information, a\ngrid-based weed prescription map was created and the weed control application\nwas implemented through a commercial-size sprayer. The decision of spraying\nherbicides on a particular grid was based on the presence of weeds in that grid\ncell. All the grids that contained at least one weed were sprayed, while the\ngrids free of weeds were not. Using our SSWC approach, we were able to save\n26.23\\% of the land (1.97 acres) from being sprayed with chemical herbicides\ncompared to the existing method. This study presents a full workflow from UAS\nimage collection to field weed control implementation using a commercial-size\nsprayer, and it shows that some level of savings can potentially be obtained\neven in a situation with high weed infestation, which might provide an\nopportunity to reduce chemical usage in corn production systems.",

    "abstract": "There is abundant observational data in the software engineering domain,\nwhereas running large-scale controlled experiments is often practically\nimpossible. Thus, most empirical studies can only report statistical\ncorrelations -- instead of potentially more insightful and robust causal\nrelations.\nThis paper discusses some novel techniques that support analyzing purely\nobservational data for causal relations. Using fundamental causal models such\nas directed acyclic graphs, one can rigorously express, and partially validate,\ncausal hypotheses; and then use the causal information to guide the\nconstruction of a statistical model that captures genuine causal relations --\nsuch that correlation does imply causation.\nWe apply these ideas to analyzing public data about programmer performance in\nCode Jam, a large world-wide coding contest organized by Google every year.\nSpecifically, we look at the impact of different programming languages on a\nparticipant's performance in the contest. While the overall effect associated\nwith programming languages is weak compared to other variables -- regardless of\nwhether we consider correlational or causal links -- we found considerable\ndifferences between a purely statistical and a causal analysis of the very same\ndata. The takeaway message is that even an imperfect causal analysis of\nobservational data can help answer the salient research questions more\nprecisely and more robustly than with just purely statistical techniques.",

    "abstract": "In the insurance industry detecting fraudulent claims is a critical task with\na significant financial impact. A common strategy to identify fraudulent claims\nis looking for inconsistencies in the supporting evidence. However, this is a\nlaborious and cognitively heavy task for human experts as insurance claims\ntypically come with a plethora of data from different modalities (e.g. images,\ntext and metadata). To overcome this challenge, the research community has\nfocused on multimodal machine learning frameworks that can efficiently reason\nthrough multiple data sources. Despite recent advances in multimodal learning,\nthese frameworks still suffer from (i) challenges of joint-training caused by\nthe different characteristics of different modalities and (ii) overfitting\ntendencies due to high model complexity. In this work, we address these\nchallenges by introducing a multimodal reasoning framework, AutoFraudNet\n(Automobile Insurance Fraud Detection Network), for detecting fraudulent\nauto-insurance claims. AutoFraudNet utilizes a cascaded slow fusion framework\nand state-of-the-art fusion block, BLOCK Tucker, to alleviate the challenges of\njoint-training. Furthermore, it incorporates a light-weight architectural\ndesign along with additional losses to prevent overfitting. Through extensive\nexperiments conducted on a real-world dataset, we demonstrate: (i) the merits\nof multimodal approaches, when compared to unimodal and bimodal methods, and\n(ii) the effectiveness of AutoFraudNet in fusing various modalities to boost\nperformance (over 3\\% in PR AUC).",

The approach starts by using stochastic modeling to model the\nbehaviors of consensus algorithms under different typical and faulty\noperational scenarios. Next, we implemented a blockchain application using\ndifferent consensus protocols and tested their performance using chaos\nengineering techniques. To demonstrate our generic evaluation approach, we\nanalyze the performance of four permissioned blockchain platforms and their\nconsensus protocols. Our results showed that stochastic modeling is an\ninexpensive and efficient technique for analyzing consensus protocols.

Moreover, an experiment with chaos engineering\nindicates that if two different blockchain platforms use the same blockchain\nalgorithm or protocol, we should not assume they will have similar performance.\nTherefore, It is also essential to consider the role of platform architecture\nand how the protocols are engineered in a given platform.",

We give an algorithm\nattaining an approximation factor of $1.786$ for weighted 3-set packing,\nimproving on the recent best result of $2-\\frac{1}{63,700,992}$ due to\nNeuwohner.\nOur algorithm is based on the local search procedure of Berman that attempts\nto improve the sum of squared weights rather than the problem's objective. When\nusing exchanges of size at most $k$, this algorithm attains an approximation\nfactor of $\\frac{k+1}{2}$. Using exchanges of size $k^2(k-1) + k$, we provide a\nrelatively simple analysis to obtain an approximation factor of 1.811 when $k =\n3$. We then show that the tools we develop can be adapted to larger exchanges\nof size $2k^2(k-1) + k$ to give an approximation factor of 1.786.

The experimental evaluation on two large,\npublicly available video datasets (MiniKinetics, ActivityNet) demonstrates that\nGated-ViGAT provides a large computational complexity reduction in comparison\nto our previous approach (ViGAT), while maintaining the excellent event\nrecognition and explainability performance.

    "abstract": "In this letter we present an improved distributed video coding (DVC) scheme\nbased on polar coding techniques. Firstly, we adapt log-likelihood ratios\n(LLRs) for DVC with integer implementation of a discrete cosine transform\n(DCT). We propose a computationally efficient and numerically stable\nmodification of these LLRs based on the simplified methods of polar codes\ndecoding. We show that on average this approach provides 0.3 dB PSNR gain for\nDVC with LDPC accumulated (LDPCA) codes. Secondly, we introduce the nested\nshortened polar codes construction algorithm. We demonstrate that replacement\nof LDPCA by polar codes improves PSNR by 0.1 dB on average, whereas, for videos\nwith relatively high motion level, the gain reaches up to 0.23, 0.39 and 0.55\ndB for Group of Pictures (GOP) lengths 2, 4 and 8 frames, respectively.\nFinally, experimental results demonstrate that DVC with polar codes and\nTal-Vardy list decoder operates up to two times faster than DVC with LDPCA code\nand belief propagation (BP) decoder.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in vision-language pre-training (e.g. CLIP) have shown\nthat vision models can benefit from language supervision. While many models\nusing language modality have achieved great success on 2D vision tasks, the\njoint representation learning of 3D point cloud with text remains\nunder-explored due to the difficulty of 3D-Text data pair acquisition and the\nirregularity of 3D data structure. In this paper, we propose a novel Text4Point\nframework to construct language-guided 3D point cloud models. The key idea is\nutilizing 2D images as a bridge to connect the point cloud and the language\nmodalities. The proposed Text4Point follows the pre-training and fine-tuning\nparadigm. During the pre-training stage, we establish the correspondence of\nimages and point clouds based on the readily available RGB-D data and use\ncontrastive learning to align the image and point cloud representations.\nTogether with the well-aligned image and text features achieved by CLIP, the\npoint cloud features are implicitly aligned with the text embeddings. Further,\nwe propose a Text Querying Module to integrate language information into 3D\nrepresentation learning by querying text embeddings with point cloud features.\nFor fine-tuning, the model learns task-specific 3D representations under\ninformative language guidance from the label set without 2D images. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our model shows consistent improvement on various\ndownstream tasks, such as point cloud semantic segmentation, instance\nsegmentation, and object detection.

ChatGPT is able to respond effectively to\na wide range of human questions, providing fluent and comprehensive answers\nthat significantly surpass previous public chatbots in terms of security and\nusefulness. On one hand, people are curious about how ChatGPT is able to\nachieve such strength and how far it is from human experts. On the other hand,\npeople are starting to worry about the potential negative impacts that large\nlanguage models (LLMs) like ChatGPT could have on society, such as fake news,\nplagiarism, and social security issues. In this work, we collected tens of\nthousands of comparison responses from both human experts and ChatGPT, with\nquestions ranging from open-domain, financial, medical, legal, and\npsychological areas. We call the collected dataset the Human ChatGPT Comparison\nCorpus (HC3). Based on the HC3 dataset, we study the characteristics of\nChatGPT's responses, the differences and gaps from human experts, and future\ndirections for LLMs. We conducted comprehensive human evaluations and\nlinguistic analyses of ChatGPT-generated content compared with that of humans,\nwhere many interesting results are revealed.

    "abstract": "Foundation models have shown impressive adaptation and scalability in\nsupervised and self-supervised learning problems, but so far these successes\nhave not fully translated to reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we\ndemonstrate that training an RL agent at scale leads to a general in-context\nlearning algorithm that can adapt to open-ended novel embodied 3D problems as\nquickly as humans. In a vast space of held-out environment dynamics, our\nadaptive agent (AdA) displays on-the-fly hypothesis-driven exploration,\nefficient exploitation of acquired knowledge, and can successfully be prompted\nwith first-person demonstrations. Adaptation emerges from three ingredients:\n(1) meta-reinforcement learning across a vast, smooth and diverse task\ndistribution, (2) a policy parameterised as a large-scale attention-based\nmemory architecture, and (3) an effective automated curriculum that prioritises\ntasks at the frontier of an agent's capabilities. We demonstrate characteristic\nscaling laws with respect to network size, memory length, and richness of the\ntraining task distribution.

The performance of thermally tuned tiny\narchitecture is further evaluated on the public as well as locally gathered\ntest data in diversified and challenging weather and environmental conditions.\nThe efficacy of a thermally tuned nano network is quantified using various\nqualitative metrics which include mean average precision, frames per second\nrate, and average inference time.

To achieve\nthis result, the model does not need to access any plaintext passwords from the\ntarget set. Instead, it exploits users' auxiliary information, such as email\naddresses, as a proxy signal to predict the underlying target password\ndistribution. The model uses deep learning to capture the correlation between\nthe auxiliary data of a group of users (e.g., users of a web application) and\ntheir passwords. It then exploits those patterns to create a tailored password\nmodel for the target community at inference time. No further training steps,\ntargeted data collection, or prior knowledge of the community's password\ndistribution is required. Besides defining a new state-of-the-art for password\nstrength estimation, our model enables any end-user (e.g., system\nadministrators) to autonomously generate tailored password models for their\nsystems without the often unworkable requirement of collecting suitable\ntraining data and fitting the underlying password model.

HTSS involves simultaneous training on multiple\nheterogeneous datasets, i.e. datasets with conflicting label spaces and\ndifferent (weak) annotation types from the perspective of semantic\nsegmentation. The HTSS formulation exposes deep networks to a larger and\npreviously unexplored aggregation of information that can potentially enhance\nsemantic segmentation in three directions: i) performance: increased\nsegmentation metrics on seen datasets, ii) generalization: improved\nsegmentation metrics on unseen datasets, and iii) knowledgeability: increased\nnumber of recognizable semantic concepts. To research these benefits of HTSS,\nwe propose a unified framework, that incorporates heterogeneous datasets in a\nsingle-network training pipeline following the established FCN standard. Our\nframework first curates heterogeneous datasets to bring them into a common\nformat and then trains a single-backbone FCN on all of them simultaneously. To\nachieve this, it transforms weak annotations, which are incompatible with\nsemantic segmentation, to per-pixel labels, and hierarchizes their label spaces\ninto a universal taxonomy. The trained HTSS models demonstrate performance and\ngeneralization gains over a wide range of datasets and extend the inference\nlabel space entailing hundreds of semantic classes.",

In this\nwork we propose to study how local learning can be applied at the level of\nsplitting layers or modules into sub-components, adding a notion of width-wise\nmodularity to the existing depth-wise modularity associated with local\nlearning. We investigate local-learning penalties that permit such models to be\ntrained efficiently. Our experiments on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Imagenet32\ndatasets demonstrate that introducing width-level modularity can lead to\ncomputational advantages over existing methods based on local learning and\nopens new opportunities for improved model-parallel distributed training.

In transportation\nsystems, the vehicular Metaverse can provide a fully-immersive and hyperreal\ntraveling experience (e.g., via augmented reality head-up displays, AR-HUDs) to\ndrivers and users in autonomous vehicles (AVs) via roadside units (RSUs).\nHowever, provisioning real-time and immersive services necessitates effective\nphysical-virtual synchronization between physical and virtual entities, i.e.,\nAVs and Metaverse AR recommenders (MARs). In this paper, we propose a\ngenerative AI-empowered physical-virtual synchronization framework for the\nvehicular Metaverse. In physical-to-virtual synchronization, digital twin (DT)\ntasks generated by AVs are offloaded for execution in RSU with future route\ngeneration. In virtual-to-physical synchronization, MARs customize diverse and\npersonal AR recommendations via generative AI models based on user preferences.\nFurthermore, we propose a multi-task enhanced auction-based mechanism to match\nand price AVs and MARs for RSUs to provision real-time and effective services.\nFinally, property analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed mechanism is strategy-proof and adverse-selection free while\nincreasing social surplus by 50%.",

For negative\nvalence, a decrease in temperature and blood perfusion was observed in the\nROIs, and the effect was greater on the left side than on the right side. In\npositive valence, the temperature and blood perfusion increased in some cases,\nshowing a complex pattern. The temperature and perfusion of the nose was\nreduced for both valences, which is indicative of the arousal dimension. The\nblood perfusion images were found to be greater contrast; the percentage\ndifferences in the blood perfusion images are greater than those obtained in\nthermographic images. Moreover, the blood perfusion images, and vasomotor\nanswer are consistent, therefore, they can be a better biomarker than\nthermographic analysis in identifying emotions.",

With our built multi-view capture\nsystem, it captures the deformable interactions with multiple perspectives,\nvarious object shapes, and diverse interactive forms. Our motivation is the\ncurrent lack of hand and deformable object interaction datasets, as 3D hand and\ndeformable object reconstruction is challenging. Mainly due to mutual\nocclusion, the interaction area is difficult to observe, the visual features\nbetween the hand and the object are entangled, and the reconstruction of the\ninteraction area deformation is difficult. To tackle this challenge, we propose\na method to annotate our captured data. Our key idea is to collaborate with\nestimated hand features to guide the object global pose estimation, and then\noptimize the deformation process of the object by analyzing the relationship\nbetween the hand and the object. Through comprehensive evaluation, the proposed\nmethod can reconstruct interactive motions of hands and deformable objects with\nhigh quality.

    "abstract": "Obtaining access to exclusive spectrum, cell sites, Radio Access Network\n(RAN) equipment, and edge infrastructure requires major capital expenses for\nmobile network operators. A neutral host infrastructure, where a third-party\ncompany provides RAN services to mobile operators through network\nvirtualization and slicing techniques, is seen as a promising solution to\ndecrease these costs. Currently, however, neutral host providers lack automated\nand virtualized pipelines for onboarding new tenants and to provide elastic and\non-demand allocation of resources matching operator's demands. To address this\ngap, this paper presents NeutRAN, a zero-touch framework based on the O-RAN\narchitecture to support applications on neutral hosts and automatic operator\nonboarding, that enables multiple tenants to access a shared RAN\ninfrastructure. The NeutRAN architecture builds upon two key components: (i) an\noptimization engine to guarantee coverage and meet quality of service\nrequirements while accounting for the limited amount of shared spectrum and RAN\nnodes, and (ii) a fully virtualized and automated infrastructure that converts\nthe output of the optimization engine into deployable micro-services to be\nexecuted at RAN nodes and cell sites. NeutRAN was prototyped on an OpenShift\ncluster and on a programmable testbed with 4 base stations and 10 users from 3\ndifferent tenants. We evaluated the benefits of NeutRAN compared to a\ntraditional license-based RAN where each tenant has dedicated physical and\nspectrum resources. Experimental results show that NeutRAN can deploy a fully\noperational neutral host-based cellular network in around 10 seconds, and it\nincreases the cumulative network throughput by 2.18x and the per-user average\nthroughput by 1.73x with shared spectrum blocks of 30 MHz.",

To reduce manual\nlabelling, active learning (AL) targets the most informative samples from the\nunlabelled set to annotate and add to the labelled training set. On one hand,\nmost active learning works have focused on the classification or limited\nsegmentation of natural images, despite active learning being highly desirable\nin the difficult task of medical image segmentation. On the other hand,\nuncertainty-based AL approaches notoriously offer sub-optimal batch-query\nstrategies, while diversity-based methods tend to be computationally expensive.\nOver and above methodological hurdles, random sampling has proven an extremely\ndifficult baseline to outperform when varying learning and sampling conditions.\nThis work aims to take advantage of the diversity and speed offered by random\nsampling to improve the selection of uncertainty-based AL methods for\nsegmenting medical images.

Experiments show that the proposed pipeline\noutperforms existing one-shot CAD-model-free methods by a large margin and is\ncomparable to CAD-model-based methods on LINEMOD even for low-textured objects.\nWe also collect a new dataset composed of 80 sequences of 40 low-textured\nobjects to facilitate future research on one-shot object pose estimation.

Second, if\nclimate change was not influential, what factors were important for predicting\nfinancial wellbeing of the farm. And third, ascertain whether observed effects\non the financial wellbeing of the farm were a result of interactions between\npredictor variables. This is the first report directly comparing climate change\nwith other factors potentially impacting financial wellbeing of farms. Certain\nclimate change factors, namely increases in temperature and reductions in\nprecipitation, can regionally impact self-perceived financial wellbeing of\nfruit farmers.

With our scheme, the server does not get to learn anything\nfurther than the subset of submodels updated by the clients: the server does\nnot get to know which client updated which submodel(s), or anything about the\nlocal client data. In comparison to the state-of-the-art private FSL schemes of\nJia-Jafar and Vithana-Ulukus, our scheme does not require noisy storage of the\nmodel at the databases; and in comparison to the secure aggregation scheme of\nZhao-Sun, our scheme does not require pre-distribution of client-side common\nrandomness, instead, our scheme creates the required client-side common\nrandomness via random SPIR and one-time pads. The protocol starts with a common\nrandomness generation (CRG) phase where the two databases establish common\nrandomness at the client-side using RSPIR and one-time pads (this phase is\ncalled FSL-CRG). Next, the clients utilize the established client-side common\nrandomness to have the server determine privately the union of indices of\nsubmodels to be updated collectively by the clients (this phase is called\nFSL-PSU). Then, the two databases broadcast the current versions of the\nsubmodels in the set union to clients. The clients update the submodels based\non their local training data. Finally, the clients use a variation of FSL-PSU\nto write the updates back to the databases privately (this phase is called\nFSL-write). Our proposed private FSL scheme is robust against client drop-outs,\nclient late-arrivals, and database drop-outs.",

To construct the\nQA dataset on structured EHR data, we conducted a poll at a university hospital\nand templatized the responses to create seed questions. Then, we manually\nlinked them to two open-source EHR databases, MIMIC-III and eICU, and included\nthem with various time expressions and held-out unanswerable questions in the\ndataset, which were all collected from the poll. Our dataset poses a unique set\nof challenges: the model needs to 1) generate SQL queries that reflect a wide\nrange of needs in the hospital, including simple retrieval and complex\noperations such as calculating survival rate, 2) understand various time\nexpressions to answer time-sensitive questions in healthcare, and 3)\ndistinguish whether a given question is answerable or unanswerable based on the\nprediction confidence.

In this\npaper, we exploit these sparse structure to recover the unknown signal uniquely\nup to inevitable ambiguities as global phase shifts, transitions, and\nconjugated reflections. Although using a constructive proof essentially based\non Prony's method, our focus lies on the derivation of a recovery guarantee for\nmultivariate signals using an adaptive sampling scheme. Instead of sampling the\nentire multivariate Fourier intensity, we only employ Fourier samples along\ncertain adaptively chosen lines.

This minute tumor-to-normal area ratio in a MIL bag inhibits the\nattention mechanism from properly weighting the areas corresponding to minor\ntumor lesions. To overcome this challenge, we propose salient instance\ninference MIL (SiiMIL), a weakly-supervised MIL model for WSI classification.\nOur method initially learns representations of normal WSIs, and it then\ncompares the normal WSIs representations with all the input patches to infer\nthe salient instances of the input WSI. Finally, it employs attention-based MIL\nto perform the slide-level classification based on the selected patches of the\nWSI. Our experiments imply that SiiMIL can accurately identify tumor instances,\nwhich could only take up less than 1% of a WSI, so that the ratio of tumor to\nnormal instances within a bag can increase by two to four times. It is worth\nmentioning that it performs equally well for large tumor lesions. As a result,\nSiiMIL achieves a significant improvement in performance over the\nstate-of-the-art MIL methods.",

Our method efficiently estimates 3D motion fields that are accurate,\ndense, and approximately diffeomorphic and incompressible. The efficacy of the\nmethod is assessed using human tongue motion during speech, and includes both\nhealthy controls and patients that have undergone glossectomy. We show that the\nmethod outperforms existing approaches, and also exhibits improvements in\nspeed, robustness to tag fading, and large tongue motion.",

The vector field of the limit-cycle oscillator is\napproximated by polynomials whose coefficients are estimated by convex\noptimization. Linear stability of the limit cycle is ensured by introducing an\nupper bound to the Floquet exponent. The validity of the proposed method is\nverified numerically by designing several types of two-dimensional existing and\nartificial oscillators. As applications, we first design a limit-cycle\noscillator with an artificial star-shaped periodic trajectory and demonstrate\nglobal entrainment.

    "abstract": "Advertisers in online ad auctions are increasingly using auto-bidding\nmechanisms to bid into auctions instead of directly bidding their value\nmanually. One prominent auto-bidding format is the target cost-per-acquisition\n(tCPA) which maximizes the volume of conversions subject to a\nreturn-of-investment constraint. From an auction theoretic perspective however,\nthis trend seems to go against foundational results that postulate that for\nprofit-maximizing bidders, it is optimal to use a classic bidding system like\nmarginal CPA (mCPA) bidding rather than using strategies like tCPA.\nIn this paper we rationalize the adoption of such seemingly sub-optimal\nbidding within the canonical quasi-linear framework. The crux of the argument\nlies in the notion of *commitment*. We consider a multi-stage game where first\nthe auctioneer declares the auction rules; then bidders select either the tCPA\nor mCPA bidding format and then, if the auctioneer lacks commitment, it can\nrevisit the rules of the auction (e.g., may readjust reserve prices depending\non the observed bids). Our main result is that so long as a bidder believes\nthat the auctioneer lacks commitment to follow the rule of the declared auction\nthen the bidder will make a higher profit by choosing the tCPA format over the\nmCPA format.\nWe then explore the commitment consequences for the auctioneer. In a\nsimplified version of the model where there is only one bidder, we show that\nthe tCPA subgame admits a *credible* equilibrium while the mCPA format does\nnot. That is, when the bidder chooses the tCPA format the auctioneer can\ncredibly implement the auction rules announced at the beginning of the game. We\nalso show that, under some mild conditions, the auctioneer's revenue is larger\nwhen the bidder uses the tCPA format rather than mCPA. We further quantify the\nvalue for the auctioneer to be able to commit to the declared auction rules.",

    "abstract": "Cross-matching operation, which is to find corresponding data for the same\ncelestial object or region from multiple catalogues,is indispensable to\nastronomical data analysis and research. Due to the large amount of\nastronomical catalogues generated by the ongoing and next-generation\nlarge-scale sky surveys, the time complexity of the cross-matching is\nincreasing dramatically. Heterogeneous computing environments provide a\ntheoretical possibility to accelerate the cross-matching, but the performance\nadvantages of heterogeneous computing resources have not been fully utilized.\nTo meet the challenge of cross-matching for substantial increasing amount of\nastronomical observation data, this paper proposes\nHeterogeneous-computing-enabled Large Catalogue Cross-matcher (HLC2), a\nhigh-performance cross-matching framework based on spherical position deviation\non CPU-GPU heterogeneous computing platforms. It supports scalable and flexible\ncross-matching and can be directly applied to the fusion of large astronomical\ncataloguesfrom survey missions and astronomical data centres. A performance\nestimation model is proposed to locate the performance bottlenecks and guide\nthe optimizations. A two-level partitioning strategy is designed to generate an\noptimized data placement according to the positions of celestial objects to\nincrease throughput. To make HLC2 a more adaptive solution, the\narchitecture-aware task splitting, thread parallelization, and concurrent\nscheduling strategies are designed and integrated. Moreover, a novel\nquad-direction strategy is proposed for the boundary problem to effectively\nbalance performance and completeness. We have experimentally evaluated HLC2\nusing public released catalogue data. Experiments demonstrate that HLC2 scales\nwell on different sizes of catalogues and the cross-matching speed is\nsignificantly improved compared to the state-of-the-art cross-matchers.",

Currently, a large number of deep\nlearning models emphasis on developing deep architectures and ignore capturing\nthe structural features of curvature objects, which may lead to unsatisfactory\nresults.

    "abstract": "The goal of Protein Structure Prediction (PSP) problem is to predict a\nprotein's 3D structure (confirmation) from its amino acid sequence. The problem\nhas been a 'holy grail' of science since the Noble prize-winning work of\nAnfinsen demonstrated that protein conformation was determined by sequence. A\nrecent and important step towards this goal was the development of AlphaFold2,\ncurrently the best PSP method. AlphaFold2 is probably the highest profile\napplication of AI to science. Both AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold (another\nimpressive PSP method) have been published and placed in the public domain\n(code & models). Stacking is a form of ensemble machine learning ML in which\nmultiple baseline models are first learnt, then a meta-model is learnt using\nthe outputs of the baseline level model to form a model that outperforms the\nbase models. Stacking has been successful in many applications. We developed\nthe ARStack PSP method by stacking AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold. ARStack\nsignificantly outperforms AlphaFold2. We rigorously demonstrate this using two\nsets of non-homologous proteins, and a test set of protein structures published\nafter that of AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold. As more high quality prediction\nmethods are published it is likely that ensemble methods will increasingly\noutperform any single method.",

    "title": "Strong inductive biases provably prevent harmless interpolation",
    "abstract": "Classical wisdom suggests that estimators should avoid fitting noise to\nachieve good generalization. In contrast, modern overparameterized models can\nyield small test error despite interpolating noise -- a phenomenon often called\n\"benign overfitting\" or \"harmless interpolation\". This paper argues that the\ndegree to which interpolation is harmless hinges upon the strength of an\nestimator's inductive bias, i.e., how heavily the estimator favors solutions\nwith a certain structure: while strong inductive biases prevent harmless\ninterpolation, weak inductive biases can even require fitting noise to\ngeneralize well. Our main theoretical result establishes tight non-asymptotic\nbounds for high-dimensional kernel regression that reflect this phenomenon for\nconvolutional kernels, where the filter size regulates the strength of the\ninductive bias. We further provide empirical evidence of the same behavior for\ndeep neural networks with varying filter sizes and rotational invariance.",

    "title": "Physics-informed Information Field Theory for Modeling Physical Systems  with Uncertainty Quantification",
    "abstract": "Data-driven approaches coupled with physical knowledge are powerful\ntechniques to model systems. The goal of such models is to efficiently solve\nfor the underlying field by combining measurements with known physical laws. As\nmany systems contain unknown elements, such as missing parameters, noisy data,\nor incomplete physical laws, this is widely approached as an uncertainty\nquantification problem. The common techniques to handle all the variables\ntypically depend on the numerical scheme used to approximate the posterior, and\nit is desirable to have a method which is independent of any such\ndiscretization. Information field theory (IFT) provides the tools necessary to\nperform statistics over fields that are not necessarily Gaussian. We extend IFT\nto physics-informed IFT (PIFT) by encoding the functional priors with\ninformation about the physical laws which describe the field. The posteriors\nderived from this PIFT remain independent of any numerical scheme and can\ncapture multiple modes, allowing for the solution of problems which are\nill-posed. We demonstrate our approach through an analytical example involving\nthe Klein-Gordon equation. We then develop a variant of stochastic gradient\nLangevin dynamics to draw samples from the joint posterior over the field and\nmodel parameters. We apply our method to numerical examples with various\ndegrees of model-form error and to inverse problems involving nonlinear\ndifferential equations. As an addendum, the method is equipped with a metric\nwhich allows the posterior to automatically quantify model-form uncertainty.\nBecause of this, our numerical experiments show that the method remains robust\nto even an incorrect representation of the physics given sufficient data. We\nnumerically demonstrate that the method correctly identifies when the physics\ncannot be trusted, in which case it automatically treats learning the field as\na regression problem.",

It is shown\nthat a large class of margin-based loss functions for binary\nclassification/regression result in estimating scores equivalent to\nlog-likelihood scores weighted by an even function. A simple characterization\nfor conformable (consistent) loss functions is given, which allows for\nstraightforward comparison of different losses, including exponential loss,\nlogistic loss, and others. The characterization is used to construct a new\nHuber-type loss function for the logistic model. A simple relation between the\nmargin and standardized logistic regression residuals is derived, demonstrating\nthat all margin-based loss can be viewed as loss functions of squared\nstandardized logistic regression residuals. The relation provides new,\nstraightforward interpretations for exponential and logistic loss, and aids in\nunderstanding why exponential loss is sensitive to outliers. In particular, it\nis shown that minimizing empirical exponential loss is equivalent to minimizing\nthe sum of squared standardized logistic regression residuals. The relation\nalso provides new insight into the AdaBoost algorithm.",

The\nMSTCI problem consists in finding a spanning tree that has the least number of\nsuch non-empty intersections and the instersection number is the number of\nnon-empty intersections of a solution. In this article we consider three\naspects of the problem in a general context (i.e. for arbitrary connected\ngraphs). The first presents two lower bounds of the intersection number. The\nsecond compares the intersection number of graphs that differ in one edge. The\nlast is an attempt to generalize a recent result for graphs with a universal\nvertex.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying cause and effect relationships is an important problem in many\ndomains. The gold standard solution is to conduct a randomised controlled\ntrial. However, in many situations such trials cannot be performed. In the\nabsence of such trials, many methods have been devised to quantify the causal\nimpact of an intervention from observational data given certain assumptions.\nOne widely used method are synthetic control models. While identifiability of\nthe causal estimand in such models has been obtained from a range of\nassumptions, it is widely and implicitly assumed that the underlying\nassumptions are satisfied for all time periods both pre- and post-intervention.\nThis is a strong assumption, as synthetic control models can only be learned in\npre-intervention period. In this paper we address this challenge, and prove\nidentifiability can be obtained without the need for this assumption, by\nshowing it follows from the principle of invariant causal mechanisms. Moreover,\nfor the first time, we formulate and study synthetic control models in Pearl's\nstructural causal model framework. Importantly, we provide a general framework\nfor sensitivity analysis of synthetic control causal inference to violations of\nthe assumptions underlying non-parametric identifiability. We end by providing\nan empirical demonstration of our sensitivity analysis framework on simulated\nand real data in the widely-used linear synthetic control framework.",

    "abstract": "Realizing the potential gains of large-scale MIMO systems requires the\naccurate estimation of their channels or the fine adjustment of their narrow\nbeams. This, however, is typically associated with high channel\nacquisition/beam sweeping overhead that scales with the number of antennas.\nMachine and deep learning represent promising approaches to overcome these\nchallenges thanks to their powerful ability to learn from prior observations\nand side information. Training machine and deep learning models, however,\nrequires large-scale datasets that are expensive to collect in deployed\nsystems. To address this challenge, we propose a novel direction that utilizes\ndigital replicas of the physical world to reduce or even eliminate the MIMO\nchannel acquisition overhead. In the proposed digital twin aided communication,\n3D models that approximate the real-world communication environment are\nconstructed and accurate ray-tracing is utilized to simulate the site-specific\nchannels. These channels can then be used to aid various communication tasks.\nFurther, we propose to use machine learning to approximate the digital replicas\nand reduce the ray tracing computational cost. To evaluate the proposed digital\ntwin based approach, we conduct a case study focusing on the position-aided\nbeam prediction task. The results show that a learning model trained solely\nwith the data generated by the digital replica can achieve relatively good\nperformance on the real-world data. Moreover, a small number of real-world data\npoints can quickly achieve near-optimal performance, overcoming the modeling\nmismatches between the physical and digital worlds and significantly reducing\nthe data acquisition overhead.",
