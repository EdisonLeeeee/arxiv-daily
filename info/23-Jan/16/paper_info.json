    "title": "Online Class-Incremental Learning For Real-World Food Classification",
    "abstract": "Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) aims to continuously learn new\ninformation from single-pass data streams to update the model and mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting. However, most existing OCIL methods make several\nassumptions, including non-overlapped classes across phases and an equal number\nof classes in each learning phase. This is a highly simplified view of typical\nreal-world scenarios. In this paper, we extend OCIL to the real-world food\nimage classification task by removing these assumptions and significantly\nimproving the performance of existing OCIL methods. We first introduce a novel\nprobabilistic framework to simulate realistic food data sequences in different\nscenarios, including strict, moderate, and open diets, as a new benchmark\nexperiment protocol. Next, we propose a novel plug-and-play module to\ndynamically select relevant images during training for the model update to\nimprove learning and forgetting performance. Our proposed module can be\nincorporated into existing Experience Replay (ER) methods, which store\nrepresentative samples from each class into an episodic memory buffer for\nknowledge rehearsal. We evaluate our method on the challenging Food-101 dataset\nand show substantial improvements over the current OCIL methods, demonstrating\ngreat potential for lifelong learning of real-world food image classification.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is an effective approach to train a\ndeep learning model at multiple nodes over a multi-hop network, without the\nneed of a server having direct connections to all nodes. In general, as long as\nnodes are connected potentially via multiple hops, the DFL process will\neventually allow each node to experience the effects of models from all other\nnodes via either direct connections or multi-hop paths, and thus is able to\ntrain a high-fidelity model at each node. We consider an effective attack that\nuses jammers to prevent the model exchanges between nodes. There are two attack\nscenarios. First, the adversary can attack any link under a certain budget.\nOnce attacked, two end nodes of a link cannot exchange their models. Secondly,\nsome jammers with limited jamming ranges are deployed in the network and a\njammer can only jam nodes within its jamming range. Once a directional link is\nattacked, the receiver node cannot receive the model from the transmitter node.\nWe design algorithms to select links to be attacked for both scenarios. For the\nsecond scenario, we also design algorithms to deploy jammers at optimal\nlocations so that they can attack critical nodes and achieve the highest impact\non the DFL process. We evaluate these algorithms by using wireless signal\nclassification over a large network area as the use case and identify how these\nattack mechanisms exploits various learning, connectivity, and sensing aspects.\nWe show that the DFL performance can be significantly reduced by jamming\nattacks launched in a wireless network and characterize the attack surface as a\nvulnerability study before the safe deployment of DFL over wireless networks.",

Therefore, researchers in the\nrecent past have extensively studied the robustness and defense of DNNs and\nSNNs under adversarial attacks. Compared to accurate SNNs (AccSNN), approximate\nSNNs (AxSNNs) are known to be up to 4X more energy-efficient for ultra-low\npower applications. Unfortunately, the robustness of AxSNNs under adversarial\nattacks is yet unexplored. In this paper, we first extensively analyze the\nrobustness of AxSNNs with different structural parameters and approximation\nlevels under two gradient-based and two neuromorphic attacks. Then, we propose\ntwo novel defense methods, i.e., precision scaling and approximate\nquantization-aware filtering (AQF), for securing AxSNNs. We evaluated the\neffectiveness of these two defense methods using both static and neuromorphic\ndatasets. Our results demonstrate that AxSNNs are more prone to adversarial\nattacks than AccSNNs, but precision scaling and AQF significantly improve the\nrobustness of AxSNNs. For instance, a PGD attack on AxSNN results in a 72\\%\naccuracy loss compared to AccSNN without any attack, whereas the same attack on\nthe precision-scaled AxSNN leads to only a 17\\% accuracy loss in the static\nMNIST dataset (4X robustness improvement). Similarly, a Sparse Attack on AxSNN\nleads to a 77\\% accuracy loss when compared to AccSNN without any attack,\nwhereas the same attack on an AxSNN with AQF leads to only a 2\\% accuracy loss\nin the neuromorphic DVS128 Gesture dataset (38X robustness improvement).",

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks have made breakthroughs in computer vision by lending\nthemselves to neuromorphic hardware. However, the neuromorphic hardware lacks\nparallelism and hence, limits the throughput and hardware acceleration of SNNs\non edge devices. To address this problem, many systolic-array SNN accelerators\n(systolicSNNs) have been proposed recently, but their reliability is still a\nmajor concern. In this paper, we first extensively analyze the impact of\npermanent faults on the SystolicSNNs. Then, we present a novel fault mitigation\nmethod, i.e., fault-aware threshold voltage optimization in retraining\n(FalVolt). FalVolt optimizes the threshold voltage for each layer in retraining\nto achieve the classification accuracy close to the baseline in the presence of\nfaults. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mitigation, we\nclassify both static (i.e., MNIST) and neuromorphic datasets (i.e., N-MNIST and\nDVS Gesture) on a 256x256 systolicSNN with stuck-at faults. We empirically show\nthat the classification accuracy of a systolicSNN drops significantly even at\nextremely low fault rates (as low as 0.012\\%). Our proposed FalVolt mitigation\nmethod improves the performance of systolicSNNs by enabling them to operate at\nfault rates of up to 60\\%, with a negligible drop in classification accuracy\n(as low as 0.1\\%). Our results show that FalVolt is 2x faster compared to other\nstate-of-the-art techniques common in artificial neural networks (ANNs), such\nas fault-aware pruning and retraining without threshold voltage optimization.",

The impressive scalability of\nLLMs due to the advent of deep learning can be seen as a continuation of\nempiricist lingusitic methods, as opposed to rule-based linguistic methods that\nare grounded in a nativist perspective. Current LLMs are generally inaccessible\nto resource-constrained researchers, due to a variety of factors including\nclosed source code. This work argues that this lack of accessibility could\ninstill a nativist bias in researchers new to computational linguistics, given\nthat new researchers may only have rule-based, nativist approaches to study to\nproduce new work. Also, given that there are numerous critics of deep learning\nclaiming that LLMs and related methods may soon lose their relevancy, we\nspeculate that such an event could trigger a new wave of nativism in the\nlanguage processing community. To prevent such a dramatic shift and placing\nfavor in hybrid methods of rules and deep learning, we call upon researchers to\nopen source their LLM code wherever possible to allow both empircist and hybrid\napproaches to remain accessible.",

    "abstract": "Intersections are essential road infrastructures for traffic in modern\nmetropolises; however, they can also be the bottleneck of traffic flows due to\ntraffic incidents or the absence of traffic coordination mechanisms such as\ntraffic lights. Thus, various control and coordination mechanisms that are\nbeyond traditional control methods have been proposed to improve the efficiency\nof intersection traffic. Amongst these methods, the control of foreseeable\nhybrid traffic that consists of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and robot vehicles\n(RVs) has recently emerged. We propose a decentralized reinforcement learning\napproach for the control and coordination of hybrid traffic at real-world,\ncomplex intersections--a topic that has not been previously explored.\nComprehensive experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of our\napproach. In particular, we show that using 5% RVs, we can prevent congestion\nformation inside the intersection under the actual traffic demand of 700\nvehicles per hour. In contrast, without RVs, congestion starts to develop when\nthe traffic demand reaches as low as 200 vehicles per hour. Further performance\ngains (reduced waiting time of vehicles at the intersection) are obtained as\nthe RV penetration rate increases. When there exist more than 50% RVs in\ntraffic, our method starts to outperform traffic signals on the average waiting\ntime of all vehicles at the intersection.\nOur method is also robust against both blackout events and sudden RV\npercentage drops, and enjoys excellent generalizablility, which is illustrated\nby its successful deployment in two unseen intersections.",

They specify communication structures essential for\nprogram correctness; a session type says what and when should be exchanged\nthrough a channel. Central to session-typed languages are sequencing constructs\nin types and processes that explicitly specify the order of actions in a\nprotocol.\nIn this paper we study session types without sequencing. The resulting\nframework of minimal session types is arguably the simplest form of session\ntypes one could conceive. In the context of a core process calculus with\nsessions and higher-order concurrency (abstraction-passing), we establish two\nmain technical results. First, we prove that every process $P$ typable with\nstandard session types can be compiled down into a process $\\mathcal{D}(P)$\ntypable with minimal session types. Second, we prove that $P$ and\n$\\mathcal{D}(P)$ are behaviorally equivalent. These results indicate that\nhaving sequencing constructs in processes and session types is convenient but\nredundant: only sequentiality in processes is truly indispensable, as it can\ncorrectly codify sequentiality in types.\nOur developments draw inspiration from work by Parrow on behavior-preserving\ndecompositions of untyped processes. By casting Parrow's results in the realm\nof typed processes, our developments reveal a conceptually simple formulation\nof session types and a principled avenue to the integration of session types\ninto programming languages without sequencing in types.",

    "title": "Probabilistic Constraint Construction for Network-safe Load Coordination",
    "abstract": "Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) can provide balancing services to the\ngrid, but their power variations might cause voltage and current constraint\nviolations in the distribution network, compromising network safety. This could\nbe avoided by including network constraints within DER control formulations,\nbut the entities coordinating DERs (e.g., aggregators) may not have access to\nnetwork information, which typically is known only to the utility. Therefore,\nit is challenging to develop network-safe DER control algorithms when the\naggregator is not the utility; it requires these entities to coordinate with\neach other. In this paper, we develop an aggregator-utility coordination\nframework that enables network-safe control of thermostatically-controlled\nloads to provide frequency regulation. In our framework, the utility sends a\nnetwork-safe constraint set on the aggregator's command without directly\nsharing any network information. We propose a constraint set construction\nalgorithm that guarantees satisfaction of a chance constraint on network\nsafety. Assuming monotonicity of the probability of network safety with respect\nto the aggregator's command, we leverage the bisection method to find the\nlargest possible constraint set, providing maximum flexibility to the\naggregator. Simulations show that, compared to two benchmark algorithms, the\nproposed approach provides a good balance between service quality and network\nsafety.",

    "abstract": "Identifying live and dead states in an abstract transition system is a\nrecurring problem in formal verification. However, state-of-the-art graph\nalgorithms for maintaining reachability information incrementally (that is, as\nstates are visited and before the entire state space is explored) assume that\nnew edges can be added from any state at any time, whereas in many\napplications, outgoing edges are added from each state as it is explored. To\nformalize the latter situation, we propose guided incremental digraphs (GIDs),\nincremental graphs which support labeling closed states (states which will not\nreceive further outgoing edges). Our main result is that dead state detection\nin GIDs is solvable in $O(\\log m)$ time per edge update for $m$ edges,\nimproving upon $O(\\sqrt{m})$ per edge due to Bender, Fineman, Gilbert, and\nTarjan (BFGT) for general incremental directed graphs.\nWe introduce two algorithms for GIDs: one establishing the logarithmic time\nbound, and a second algorithm to explore a lazy heuristics-based approach. To\ndemonstrate applicability, we show how GIDs can be used to lazily decide\nregular expression constraints in SMT applications. To enable an\napples-to-apples experimental comparison, we implemented both algorithms, two\nnaive baselines, and the state-of-the-art BFGT baseline using a common directed\ngraph interface in Rust. Our evaluation shows $110$-$530$x speedups over BFGT\nfor the largest input graphs over a range of graph classes, random graphs, and\ngraphs arising from regular expression benchmarks.",

One reason is that agents normally choose their\nactions independently of one another. In order to see coordination strategies\nemerging from the combination of independent policies, the recent research has\nfocused on the use of a centralized function (CF) that learns each agent's\ncontribution to the team reward. However, the structure in which the\nenvironment is presented to the agents and to the CF is typically overlooked.\nWe have observed that the features used to describe the coordination problem\ncan be represented as vertex features of a latent graph structure. Here, we\npresent TransfQMix, a new approach that uses transformers to leverage this\nlatent structure and learn better coordination policies. Our transformer agents\nperform a graph reasoning over the state of the observable entities. Our\ntransformer Q-mixer learns a monotonic mixing-function from a larger graph that\nincludes the internal and external states of the agents. TransfQMix is designed\nto be entirely transferable, meaning that same parameters can be used to\ncontrol and train larger or smaller teams of agents. This enables to deploy\npromising approaches to save training time and derive general policies in MARL,\nsuch as transfer learning, zero-shot transfer, and curriculum learning. We\nreport TransfQMix's performances in the Spread and StarCraft II environments.\nIn both settings, it outperforms state-of-the-art Q-Learning models, and it\ndemonstrates effectiveness in solving problems that other methods can not\nsolve.",

To address this issue,\nthis paper starts to estimate the OD trips travel time combined with the road\nnetwork. Subsequently, a Multitask Weakly Supervised Learning Framework for\nTravel Time Estimation (MWSL TTE) has been proposed to infer transition\nprobability between roads segments, and the travel time on road segments and\nintersection simultaneously. Technically, given an OD pair, the transition\nprobability intends to recover the most possible route.

A novel route recovery function has been proposed to\niteratively maximize the current route's co occurrence probability, and\nminimize the discrepancy between routes' probability distribution and the\ninverse distribution of routes' estimation loss. Moreover, the expected log\nlikelihood function based on a weakly supervised framework has been deployed in\noptimizing the travel time from road segments and intersections concurrently.\nWe conduct experiments on a wide range of real world taxi datasets in Xi'an and\nChengdu and demonstrate our method's effectiveness on route recovery and travel\ntime estimation.",

The automatic generation of such co-speech\ngestures is a long-standing problem in computer animation and is considered an\nenabling technology in film, games, virtual social spaces, and for interaction\nwith social robots. The problem is made challenging by the idiosyncratic and\nnon-periodic nature of human co-speech gesture motion, and by the great\ndiversity of communicative functions that gestures encompass. Gesture\ngeneration has seen surging interest recently, owing to the emergence of more\nand larger datasets of human gesture motion, combined with strides in\ndeep-learning-based generative models, that benefit from the growing\navailability of data. This review article summarizes co-speech gesture\ngeneration research, with a particular focus on deep generative models. First,\nwe articulate the theory describing human gesticulation and how it complements\nspeech. Next, we briefly discuss rule-based and classical statistical gesture\nsynthesis, before delving into deep learning approaches. We employ the choice\nof input modalities as an organizing principle, examining systems that generate\ngestures from audio, text, and non-linguistic input. We also chronicle the\nevolution of the related training data sets in terms of size, diversity, motion\nquality, and collection method. Finally, we identify key research challenges in\ngesture generation, including data availability and quality; producing\nhuman-like motion; grounding the gesture in the co-occurring speech in\ninteraction with other speakers, and in the environment; performing gesture\nevaluation; and integration of gesture synthesis into applications.

However, ViTs are typically constructed\nwith large-scale sizes, which then severely hinder their potential deployment\nin many practical resources-constrained applications. To mitigate this\nchallenging problem, structured pruning is a promising solution to compress\nmodel size and enable practical efficiency. However, unlike its current\npopularity for CNNs and RNNs, structured pruning for ViT models is little\nexplored.\nIn this paper, we propose GOHSP, a unified framework of Graph and\nOptimization-based Structured Pruning for ViT models.

    "abstract": "Interactive Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are becoming increasingly\nprevalent in society. However, application of such systems without\nunderstanding them can be problematic. Black-box AI systems can lead to\nliability and accountability issues when they produce an incorrect decision.\nExplainable AI (XAI) seeks to bridge the knowledge gap, between developers and\nend-users, by offering insights into how an AI algorithm functions. Many modern\nalgorithms focus on making the AI model \"transparent\", i.e. unveil the inherent\nfunctionality of the agent in a simpler format. However, these approaches do\nnot cater to end-users of these systems, as users may not possess the requisite\nknowledge to understand these explanations in a reasonable amount of time.\nTherefore, to be able to develop suitable XAI methods, we need to understand\nthe factors which influence subjective perception and objective usability. In\nthis paper, we present a novel user-study which studies four differing XAI\nmodalities commonly employed in prior work for explaining AI behavior, i.e.\nDecision Trees, Text, Programs. We study these XAI modalities in the context of\nexplaining the actions of a self-driving car on a highway, as driving is an\neasily understandable real-world task and self-driving cars is a keen area of\ninterest within the AI community. Our findings highlight internal consistency\nissues wherein participants perceived language explanations to be significantly\nmore usable, however participants were better able to objectively understand\nthe decision making process of the car through a decision tree explanation. Our\nwork also provides further evidence of importance of integrating user-specific\nand situational criteria into the design of XAI systems. Our findings show that\nfactors such as computer science experience, and watching the car succeed or\nfail can impact the perception and usefulness of the explanation.",

    "abstract": "We study concentration phenomena in gossip opinion dynamics over random\ngraphs. In the model, a network is generated from a random graph with\nindependent edges, and agents interact pairwise randomly over the network.\nDuring the process, regular agents average the opinions of themselves and their\nneighbors as updates, whereas stubborn agents do not change opinions. To\napproximate the original process, we introduce gossip dynamics over an averaged\ngraph, obtained by averaging all possible networks generated from the random\ngraph. Using concentration inequalities, we derive high-probability bounds for\nthe difference between the expected final opinions of the regular agents in the\noriginal gossip process and those in the dynamics over the averaged graph. The\nresult shows that the expected final opinions for most networks generated from\nthe random graph are close to the final opinions of the averaged graph, which\nare convex combinations of stubborn-agent states with weights depending on link\nprobability between regular and stubborn agents. We further show how such\nconcentration can help study the effect of network topology on the expected\nfinal opinions in two cases, using matrix perturbation theory: (i) When the\ninfluence of stubborn agents is large, the original expected final opinions\npolarize. (ii) When the influence of stubborn agents is small, the expected\nfinal opinions are close to each other. With the help of concentration\ninequalities of Markov chains, we obtain high-probability bounds for the\ndifference between the time average of agent states in the original process and\nthe expected final opinions of the averaged graph.

To approach this goal, we focus on the text-to-point-cloud cross-modal\nlocalization problem. Given a textual query, it aims to identify the described\nlocation from city-scale point clouds. The task involves two challenges. 1) In\ncity-scale point clouds, similar ambient instances may exist in several\nlocations. Searching each location in a huge point cloud with only instances as\nguidance may lead to less discriminative signals and incorrect results. 2) In\ntextual descriptions, the hints are provided separately. In this case, the\nrelations among those hints are not explicitly described, leading to\ndifficulties of learning relations. To overcome these two challenges, we\npropose a unified Relation-Enhanced Transformer (RET) to improve representation\ndiscriminability for both point cloud and natural language queries. The core of\nthe proposed RET is a novel Relation-enhanced Self-Attention (RSA) mechanism,\nwhich explicitly encodes instance (hint)-wise relations for the two modalities.\nMoreover, we propose a fine-grained cross-modal matching method to further\nrefine the location predictions in a subsequent instance-hint matching stage.\nExperimental results on the KITTI360Pose dataset demonstrate that our approach\nsurpasses the previous state-of-the-art method by large margin.",

Objective. This study aims to investigate the\neffects of remote work on LGBTQIA+ software professionals. Method.

    "abstract": "Medical images are generally acquired with limited field-of-view (FOV), which\ncould lead to incomplete regions of interest (ROI), and thus impose a great\nchallenge on medical image analysis. This is particularly evident for the\nlearning-based multi-target landmark detection, where algorithms could be\nmisleading to learn primarily the variation of background due to the varying\nFOV, failing the detection of targets. Based on learning a navigation policy,\ninstead of predicting targets directly, reinforcement learning (RL)-based\nmethods have the potential totackle this challenge in an efficient manner.\nInspired by this, in this work we propose a multi-agent RL framework for\nsimultaneous multi-target landmark detection. This framework is aimed to learn\nfrom incomplete or (and) complete images to form an implicit knowledge of\nglobal structure, which is consolidated during the training stage for the\ndetection of targets from either complete or incomplete test images. To further\nexplicitly exploit the global structural information from incomplete images, we\npropose to embed a shape model into the RL process. With this prior knowledge,\nthe proposed RL model can not only localize dozens of targetssimultaneously,\nbut also work effectively and robustly in the presence of incomplete images. We\nvalidated the applicability and efficacy of the proposed method on various\nmulti-target detection tasks with incomplete images from practical clinics,\nusing body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), cardiac MRI and head CT\ndatasets. Results showed that our method could predict whole set of landmarks\nwith incomplete training images up to 80% missing proportion (average distance\nerror 2.29 cm on body DXA), and could detect unseen landmarks in regions with\nmissing image information outside FOV of target images (average distance error\n6.84 mm on 3D half-head CT).",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) must share the driving space with other drivers and\noften employ conservative motion planning strategies to ensure safety. These\nconservative strategies can negatively impact AV's performance and\nsignificantly slow traffic throughput. Therefore, to avoid conservatism, we\ndesign an interaction-aware motion planner for the ego vehicle (AV) that\ninteracts with surrounding vehicles to perform complex maneuvers in a locally\noptimal manner. Our planner uses a neural network-based interactive trajectory\npredictor and analytically integrates it with model predictive control (MPC).\nWe solve the MPC optimization using the alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM) and prove the algorithm's convergence. We provide an\nempirical study and compare our method with a baseline heuristic method.",

    "abstract": "A well-designed recommender system can accurately capture the attributes of\nusers and items, reflecting the unique preferences of individuals. Traditional\nrecommendation techniques usually focus on modeling the singular type of\nbehaviors between users and items. However, in many practical recommendation\nscenarios (e.g., social media, e-commerce), there exist multi-typed interactive\nbehaviors in user-item relationships, such as click, tag-as-favorite, and\npurchase in online shopping platforms. Thus, how to make full use of\nmulti-behavior information for recommendation is of great importance to the\nexisting system, which presents challenges in two aspects that need to be\nexplored: (1) Utilizing users' personalized preferences to capture\nmulti-behavioral dependencies; (2) Dealing with the insufficient recommendation\ncaused by sparse supervision signal for target behavior. In this work, we\npropose a Knowledge Enhancement Multi-Behavior Contrastive Learning\nRecommendation (KMCLR) framework, including two Contrastive Learning tasks and\nthree functional modules to tackle the above challenges, respectively. In\nparticular, we design the multi-behavior learning module to extract users'\npersonalized behavior information for user-embedding enhancement, and utilize\nknowledge graph in the knowledge enhancement module to derive more robust\nknowledge-aware representations for items. In addition, in the optimization\nstage, we model the coarse-grained commonalities and the fine-grained\ndifferences between multi-behavior of users to further improve the\nrecommendation effect. Extensive experiments and ablation tests on the three\nreal-world datasets indicate our KMCLR outperforms various state-of-the-art\nrecommendation methods and verify the effectiveness of our method.",

Because\nstandard AI approaches did not converge to reasonable solutions, we pre-train\nthe RNN with special initial weights devised to turn it into a numerical solver\nof the differential equation.

This is a classical scheduling problem, first considered\nby [Lawler and Moore 1969], that also generalizes the Subset Sum problem.\nRecently, it was shown that this problem can be solved efficiently by computing\n$(\\max,\\min)$-skewed-convolutions. The running time of the resulting algorithm\nis equivalent, up to logarithmic factors, to the time it takes to compute a\n$(\\max,\\min)$-skewed-convolution of two vectors of integers whose sum is\n$O(P)$, where $P$ is the sum of the jobs' processing times. We further improve\nthe running time of the minimum tardy processing time computation by\nintroducing a job ``bundling'' technique and achieve a\n$\\tilde{O}\\left(P^{2-1/\\alpha}\\right)$ running time, where\n$\\tilde{O}\\left(P^\\alpha\\right)$ is the running time of a\n$(\\max,\\min)$-skewed-convolution of vectors of size $P$. This results in a\n$\\tilde{O}\\left(P^{7/5}\\right)$ time algorithm for tardy processing time\nminimization, an improvement over the previously known\n$\\tilde{O}\\left(P^{5/3}\\right)$ time algorithm.",

Semi-supervised image\nsegmentation can alleviate the problem by utilizing a large number of unlabeled\nimages along with limited labeled images. However, learning a robust\nrepresentation from numerous unlabeled images remains challenging due to\npotential noise in pseudo labels and insufficient class separability in feature\nspace, which undermines the performance of current semi-supervised segmentation\napproaches. To address the issues above, we propose a novel semi-supervised\nsegmentation method named as Rectified Contrastive Pseudo Supervision (RCPS),\nwhich combines a rectified pseudo supervision and voxel-level contrastive\nlearning to improve the effectiveness of semi-supervised segmentation.\nParticularly, we design a novel rectification strategy for the pseudo\nsupervision method based on uncertainty estimation and consistency\nregularization to reduce the noise influence in pseudo labels.

To bridge the gap, we adopt a pattern-oriented approach and build a\nresponsible AI pattern catalogue for operationalising responsible AI from a\nsystem perspective. In this article, we first summarise the major challenges in\noperationalising responsible AI at scale and introduce how we use responsible\nAI pattern catalogue to address those challenges. Then, we discuss the case\nstudy we have conducted using the chatbot development use case to evaluate the\nusefulness of the pattern catalogue.",

    "abstract": "The simplest and often most effective way of parallelizing the training of\ncomplex machine learning models is to execute several training instances on\nmultiple machines, possibly scanning the hyperparameter space to optimize the\nunderlying statistical model and the learning procedure. Often, such a meta\nlearning procedure is limited by the ability of accessing securely a common\ndatabase organizing the knowledge of the previous and ongoing trials.\nExploiting opportunistic GPUs provided in different environments represents a\nfurther challenge when designing such optimization campaigns. In this\ncontribution we discuss how a set of RestAPIs can be used to access a dedicated\nservice based on INFN Cloud to monitor and possibly coordinate multiple\ntraining instances, with gradient-less optimization techniques, via simple HTTP\nrequests. The service, named Hopaas (Hyperparameter OPtimization As A Service),\nis made of web interface and sets of APIs implemented with a FastAPI back-end\nrunning through Uvicorn and NGINX in a virtual instance of INFN Cloud. The\noptimization algorithms are currently based on Bayesian techniques as provided\nby Optuna. A Python front-end is also made available for quick prototyping. We\npresent applications to hyperparameter optimization campaigns performed\ncombining private, INFN Cloud and CINECA resources.",

    "title": "Understanding Concept Identification as Consistent Data Clustering  Across Multiple Feature Spaces",
    "abstract": "Identifying meaningful concepts in large data sets can provide valuable\ninsights into engineering design problems. Concept identification aims at\nidentifying non-overlapping groups of design instances that are similar in a\njoint space of all features, but which are also similar when considering only\nsubsets of features. These subsets usually comprise features that characterize\na design with respect to one specific context, for example, constructive design\nparameters, performance values, or operation modes. It is desirable to evaluate\nthe quality of design concepts by considering several of these feature subsets\nin isolation. In particular, meaningful concepts should not only identify\ndense, well separated groups of data instances, but also provide\nnon-overlapping groups of data that persist when considering pre-defined\nfeature subsets separately. In this work, we propose to view concept\nidentification as a special form of clustering algorithm with a broad range of\npotential applications beyond engineering design. To illustrate the differences\nbetween concept identification and classical clustering algorithms, we apply a\nrecently proposed concept identification algorithm to two synthetic data sets\nand show the differences in identified solutions. In addition, we introduce the\nmutual information measure as a metric to evaluate whether solutions return\nconsistent clusters across relevant subsets. To support the novel understanding\nof concept identification, we consider a simulated data set from a\ndecision-making problem in the energy management domain and show that the\nidentified clusters are more interpretable with respect to relevant feature\nsubsets than clusters found by common clustering algorithms and are thus more\nsuitable to support a decision maker.",

    "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) based remote sensing (RS) image\nsemantic segmentation technology has achieved great success used in many\nreal-world applications such as geographic element analysis. However, strong\ndependency on annotated data of specific scene makes it hard for DCNNs to fit\ndifferent RS scenes. To solve this problem, recent works gradually focus on\ncross-domain RS image semantic segmentation task. In this task, different\nground sampling distance, remote sensing sensor variation and different\ngeographical landscapes are three main factors causing dramatic domain shift\nbetween source and target images. To decrease the negative influence of domain\nshift, we propose a self-training guided disentangled adaptation network\n(ST-DASegNet). We first propose source student backbone and target student\nbackbone to respectively extract the source-style and target-style feature for\nboth source and target images. Towards the intermediate output feature maps of\neach backbone, we adopt adversarial learning for alignment. Then, we propose a\ndomain disentangled module to extract the universal feature and purify the\ndistinct feature of source-style and target-style features. Finally, these two\nfeatures are fused and served as input of source student decoder and target\nstudent decoder to generate final predictions. Based on our proposed domain\ndisentangled module, we further propose exponential moving average (EMA) based\ncross-domain separated self-training mechanism to ease the instability and\ndisadvantageous effect during adversarial optimization. Extensive experiments\nand analysis on benchmark RS datasets show that ST-DASegNet outperforms\nprevious methods on cross-domain RS image semantic segmentation task and\nachieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.

Those are\nconnected to the CPU and the separate Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) via\nthe I2C-based PMBus.\nIn this paper, using the case study of the widely used Supermicro X11SSL\nmotherboard, we show how remotely exploitable software weaknesses in the BMC\n(or other processors with PMBus access) can be used to access the PMBus and\nthen perform hardware-based fault injection attacks on the main CPU. The\nunderlying weaknesses include insecure firmware encryption and signing\nmechanisms, a lack of authentication for the firmware upgrade process and the\nIPMI KCS control interface, as well as the motherboard design (with the PMBus\nconnected to the BMC and SMBus by default).\nFirst, we show that undervolting through the PMBus allows breaking the\nintegrity guarantees of SGX enclaves, bypassing Intel's countermeasures against\nprevious undervolting attacks like Plundervolt/V0ltPwn. Second, we\nexperimentally show that overvolting outside the specified range has the\npotential of permanently damaging Intel Xeon CPUs, rendering the server\ninoperable. We assess the impact of our findings on other server motherboards\nmade by Supermicro and ASRock.\nOur attacks, dubbed PMFault, can be carried out by a privileged software\nadversary and do not require physical access to the server motherboard or\nknowledge of the BMC login credentials.\nWe responsibly disclosed the issues reported in this paper to Supermicro and\ndiscuss possible countermeasures at different levels. To the best of our\nknowledge, the 12th generation of Supermicro motherboards, which was designed\nbefore we reported PMFault to Supermicro, is not vulnerable.",

    "abstract": "Maximizing quality of experience (QoE) for interactive video streaming has\nbeen a long-standing challenge, as its delay-sensitive nature makes it more\nvulnerable to bandwidth fluctuations. While reinforcement learning (RL) has\ndemonstrated great potential, existing works are either limited by fixed models\nor require enormous data/time for online adaptation, which struggle to fit\ntime-varying and diverse network states. Driven by these practical concerns, we\nperform large-scale measurements on WeChat for Business's interactive video\nservice to study real-world network fluctuations. Surprisingly, our analysis\nshows that, compared to time-varying network metrics, network sequences exhibit\nnoticeable short-term continuity, sufficient for few-shot learning\nrequirements. We thus propose Fiammetta, the first meta-RL-based bitrate\nadaptation algorithm for interactive video streaming. Building on the\nshort-term continuity, Fiammetta accumulates learning experiences through\noffline meta-training and enables fast online adaptation to changing network\nstates through a few gradient updates. Moreover, Fiammetta innovatively\nincorporates a probing mechanism for real-time monitoring of network states,\nand proposes an adaptive meta-testing mechanism for seamless adaptation. We\nimplement Fiammetta on a testbed whose end-to-end network follows the\nreal-world WeChat for Business traces. The results show that Fiammetta\noutperforms prior algorithms significantly, improving video bitrate by\n3.6%-16.2% without increasing stalling rate.",

However, current studies of wireless FL typically\nconsider a single task in a single-cell wireless network, ignoring the impact\nof inter-cell interference on learning performance. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable\nintelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted over-the-air computation based vertical\nFL system in multi-cell networks, in which a STAR-RIS is deployed at the cell\nedge to facilitate the completion of different FL tasks in different cells. We\nestablish the convergence of the proposed system through theoretical analysis\nand introduce the Pareto boundary of the optimality gaps to characterize the\ntrade-off among cells. Based on the analysis, we then jointly design the\ntransmit and receive beamforming as well as the STAR-RIS transmission and\nreflection coefficient matrices to minimize the sum of the gaps of all cells.\nTo solve the non-convex resource allocation problem, we introduce a successive\nconvex approximation based algorithm.

An analogous approach can also be applied to the\nmechanical loads on a wind turbine, such as generator torque. The constructed\nSDE consists of the deterministic and stochastic terms, the latter\ncorresponding to the highly fluctuating behavior of the wind turbine. Here we\nshow how advanced stochastic analysis of the noise contribution can be used to\nshow different operating modes of the conversion process of a wind turbine. The\nparameters of the SDE, known as Kramers-Moyal (KM) coefficients, are estimated\ndirectly from the measurement data. Clear evidence is found that both,\ncontinuous diffusion noise and discontinuous jump noise are present. The\ndifference in the noise contributions indicates different operational regions.\nIn particular, we observe that the jump character or discontinuity in power\nproduction has a significant contribution in the regions where the control\nsystem switches strategies. We find that there is a high increase in jump\namplitude near the transition to the rated region, and the switching strategies\ncannot result in a smooth transition.

Besides, by counting the number of\ninstances with different degrees of overlap of CrowdHuman dataset, we find that\nthe number of severely overlapping objects and the number of slightly\noverlapping objects are unbalanced, which may exacerbate the challenges posed\nby occlusion issues. Regarding to the noise issue, from the perspective of\ndenoising, an iterable dynamic instance noise filter (DINF) is proposed for the\nRCNN-based pedestrian detectors to improve the signal-noise ratio of the\ninstance feature. Simulating the wavelet denoising process, we use the instance\nfeature vector to generate dynamic convolutional kernels to transform the RoIs\nfeatures to a domain in which the near-zero values represent the noise\ninformation. Then, soft thresholding with channel-wise adaptive thresholds is\napplied to convert the near-zero values to zero to filter out noise\ninformation. For the imbalance issue, we propose an IoU-Focal factor (IFF) to\nmodulate the contributions of the well-regressed boxes and the bad-regressed\nboxes to the loss in the training process, paying more attention to the\nminority severely overlapping objects. Extensive experiments conducted on\nCrowdHuman and CityPersons demonstrate that our methods can help RCNN-based\npedestrian detectors achieve state-of-the-art performance.",

The objectives\ninclude the advancement of natural language processing (NLP) information\nextraction techniques for SDOH and clinical information more broadly. This\npaper presents the shared task, data, participating teams, performance results,\nand considerations for future work.\nMaterials and Methods: The task used the Social History Annotated Corpus\n(SHAC), which consists of clinical text with detailed event-based annotations\nfor SDOH events such as alcohol, drug, tobacco, employment, and living\nsituation. Each SDOH event is characterized through attributes related to\nstatus, extent, and temporality. The task includes three subtasks related to\ninformation extraction (Subtask A), generalizability (Subtask B), and learning\ntransfer (Subtask C). In addressing this task, participants utilized a range of\ntechniques, including rules, knowledge bases, n-grams, word embeddings, and\npretrained language models (LM).\nResults: A total of 15 teams participated, and the top teams utilized\npretrained deep learning LM. The top team across all subtasks used a\nsequence-to-sequence approach achieving 0.901 F1 for Subtask A, 0.774 F1\nSubtask B, and 0.889 F1 for Subtask C.\nConclusions: Similar to many NLP tasks and domains, pretrained LM yielded the\nbest performance, including generalizability and learning transfer. An error\nanalysis indicates extraction performance varies by SDOH, with lower\nperformance achieved for conditions, like substance use and homelessness, that\nincrease health risks (risk factors) and higher performance achieved for\nconditions, like substance abstinence and living with family, that reduce\nhealth risks (protective factors).",

    "abstract": "Gait disabilities are among the most frequent worldwide. Their treatment\nrelies on rehabilitation therapies, in which smart walkers are being introduced\nto empower the user's recovery and autonomy, while reducing the clinicians\neffort. For that, these should be able to decode human motion and needs, as\nearly as possible. Current walkers decode motion intention using information of\nwearable or embedded sensors, namely inertial units, force and hall sensors,\nand lasers, whose main limitations imply an expensive solution or hinder the\nperception of human movement. Smart walkers commonly lack a seamless\nhuman-robot interaction, which intuitively understands human motions. A\ncontactless approach is proposed in this work, addressing human motion decoding\nas an early action recognition/detection problematic, using RGB-D cameras. We\nstudied different deep learning-based algorithms, organised in three different\napproaches, to process lower body RGB-D video sequences, recorded from an\nembedded camera of a smart walker, and classify them into 4 classes (stop,\nwalk, turn right/left). A custom dataset involving 15 healthy participants\nwalking with the device was acquired and prepared, resulting in 28800 balanced\nRGB-D frames, to train and evaluate the deep networks. The best results were\nattained by a convolutional neural network with a channel attention mechanism,\nreaching accuracy values of 99.61% and above 93%, for offline early\ndetection/recognition and trial simulations, respectively. Following the\nhypothesis that human lower body features encode prominent information,\nfostering a more robust prediction towards real-time applications, the\nalgorithm focus was also evaluated using Dice metric, leading to values\nslightly higher than 30%. Promising results were attained for early action\ndetection as a human motion decoding strategy, with enhancements in the focus\nof the proposed architectures.",

Pulse shaping is an important process in\nall communication systems, as it modifies the waveform of transmitted signals\nto match the characteristics of the communication channel for reliable and\nhigh-speed information transfer. In MC systems, the unconventional\narchitectures of components, such as transmitters and receivers, and the\ncomplex, nonlinear, and time-varying nature of MC channels make pulse shaping\neven more important.

Moreover, the majority of recently proposed experimental MC testbeds\nthat rely on microfluidics technology lack the incorporation of programmable\npulse shaping methods, which hinders the accurate evaluation of MC techniques\nin practical settings. To address the challenges associated with pulse shaping\nin microfluidic MC systems, we provide a comprehensive overview of practical\nmicrofluidic chemical waveform generation techniques that have been\nexperimentally validated and whose architectures can inform the design of pulse\nshaping methods for microfluidic MC systems and testbeds.

However, the\nliterature claims that the KGEM evaluation procedure would benefit from adding\nsupplementary dimensions to assess. That is why, in this paper, we extend our\npreviously introduced metric Sem@$K$ that measures the capability of models to\npredict valid entities w.r.t. domain and range constrains. In particular, we\nconsider a broad range of KGs and take their respective characteristics into\naccount to propose different versions of Sem@$K$. We also perform an extensive\nstudy of KGEM semantic awareness. Our experiments show that Sem@$K$ provides a\nnew perspective on KGEM quality. Its joint analysis with rank-based metrics\noffer different conclusions on the predictive power of models. Regarding\nSem@$K$, some KGEMs are inherently better than others, but this semantic\nsuperiority is not indicative of their performance w.r.t. rank-based metrics.\nIn this work, we generalize conclusions about the relative performance of KGEMs\nw.r.t. rank-based and semantic-oriented metrics at the level of families of\nmodels.

We empirically show that the proposed extension not only\noutperforms the purely planning-based- and purely data-driven goal recognition\nmethods but is also able to recognize the correct goal more reliably,\nespecially when only a small number of observations were seen. This\nsubstantially improves the usefulness of hybrid goal recognition approaches for\nintelligent assistance systems, as recognizing a goal early opens much more\npossibilities for supportive reactions of the system.",

    "abstract": "Human-robot co-manipulation of soft materials, such as fabrics, composites,\nand sheets of paper/cardboard, is a challenging operation that presents several\nrelevant industrial applications. Estimating the deformation state of the\nco-manipulated material is one of the main challenges. Viable methods provide\nthe indirect measure by calculating the human-robot relative distance. In this\npaper, we develop a data-driven model to estimate the deformation state of the\nmaterial from a depth image through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).\nFirst, we define the deformation state of the material as the relative\nroto-translation from the current robot pose and a human grasping position. The\nmodel estimates the current deformation state through a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork, specifically a DenseNet-121 pretrained on ImageNet.The delta between\nthe current and the desired deformation state is fed to the robot controller\nthat outputs twist commands. The paper describes the developed approach to\nacquire, preprocess the dataset and train the model. The model is compared with\nthe current state-of-the-art method based on a skeletal tracker from cameras.\nResults show that our approach achieves better performances and avoids the\nvarious drawbacks caused by using a skeletal tracker.Finally, we also studied\nthe model performance according to different architectures and dataset\ndimensions to minimize the time required for dataset acquisition",

    "abstract": "Model order reduction usually consists of two stages: the offline stage and\nthe online stage. The offline stage is the expensive part that sometimes takes\nhours till the final reduced-order model is derived, especially when the\noriginal model is very large or complex. Once the reduced-order model is\nobtained, the online stage of querying the reduced-order model for simulation\nis very fast and often real-time capable. This work concerns a strategy to\nsignificantly speed up the offline stage of model order reduction for large and\ncomplex systems. In particular, it is successful in accelerating the greedy\nalgorithm that is often used in the offline stage for reduced-order model\nconstruction. We propose multi-fidelity error estimators and replace the\nhigh-fidelity error estimator in the greedy algorithm. Consequently, the\ncomputational complexity at each iteration of the greedy algorithm is reduced\nand the algorithm converges more than 3 times faster without incurring\nnoticeable accuracy loss.",

In this article, we briefly discuss recent studies of learning\nthrough large-scale digital platforms, but largely focus on those exploring\nsociological aspects of education.

The scale-standardization step has recently\ncome under criticism as inappropriate, at least for growth studies. This essay\nargues for a similar rethinking of the centering and rotation, and then the\nreplacement of the thin-plate spline interpolant of the resulting\nconfigurations by a different strategy that leaves unexplained residuals at\nevery landmark individually in order to simplify the interpretation of the\ndisplayed grid as a whole, the \"transformation grid\" that has been highlighted\nas the true underlying topic ever since D'Arcy Thompson's exposition of 1917.\nFor analyses of comparisons involving gradients at large geometric scale,\nthis paper argues for replacement of all the Procrustes conventions by a\nversion of my two-point registration of 1986 (originally Francis Galton's of\n1907). The choice of the two points interacts with another non-Procrustes\nconcern, interpretability of the grid lines of a coordinate system deformed\naccording to a fitted polynomial trend rather than an interpolating thin-plate\nspline.\nThe paper works two examples using previously published cranial data; there\nresult new findings pertinent to the interpretation of both of these classic\ndata sets.\nA concluding discussion suggests that the current toolkit of geometric\nmorphometrics, centered on Procrustes shape coordinates and thin-plate splines,\nis too restricted to suit many of the interpretive purposes of evolutionary and\ndevelopmental biology.",

To achieve better inpainting quality, we propose to exploit\nboth the global and local context of indoor panorama during the inpainting\nprocess. Specifically, we take the low-level layout edges estimated from the\ninput panorama as a prior to guide the inpainting model for recovering the\nglobal indoor structure.

In these cases, the commonly used random\nexploration is often not helpful. The literature shows that this kind of\nenvironments require enormous efforts to systematically explore large chunks of\nthe state space. Learned state representations can help here to improve the\nsearch by providing semantic context and build a structure on top of the raw\nobservations. In this work we introduce a novel time-myopic state\nrepresentation that clusters temporal close states together while providing a\ntime prediction capability between them. By adapting this model to the\nGo-Explore paradigm (Ecoffet et al., 2021b), we demonstrate the first learned\nstate representation that reliably estimates novelty instead of using the\nhand-crafted representation heuristic. Our method shows an improved solution\nfor the detachment problem which still remains an issue at the Go-Explore\nExploration Phase. We provide evidence that our proposed method covers the\nentire state space with respect to all possible time trajectories without\ncausing disadvantageous conflict-overlaps in the cell archive.

In this work we close\nthis gap, up to logarithmic factors.\nIn order to do so we consider the needle problem, which is a natural hard\nproblem for frequency estimation studied in (Andoni et al. 2008, Crouch et al.\n2016). Here, the goal is to distinguish between two distributions over data\nstreams with $t$ samples. The first is uniform over a large enough domain. The\nsecond is a planted model; a secret ''needle'' is uniformly chosen, and then\neach element in the stream equals the needle with probability $p$, and\notherwise is uniformly chosen from the domain. It is simple to design streaming\nalgorithms that distinguish the distributions using space $s \\approx 1/(p^2\nt)$. It was unclear if this is tight, as the existing lower bounds are weaker.\nWe close this gap and show that the trade-off is near optimal, up to a\nlogarithmic factor.\nOur proof builds and extends classical connections between streaming\nalgorithms and communication complexity, concretely multi-party unique\nset-disjointness. We introduce two new ingredients that allow us to prove sharp\nbounds. The first is a lower bound for an asymmetric version of multi-party\nunique set-disjointness, where players receive input sets of different sizes,\nand where the communication of each player is normalized relative to their\ninput length. The second is a combinatorial technique that allows to sample\nneedles in the planted model by first sampling intervals, and then sampling a\nuniform needle in each interval.",

    "abstract": "Stylometry is mostly applied to authorial style. Recently, researchers have\nbegun investigating the style of characters, finding that the variation remains\nwithin authorial bounds. We address the stylistic distinctiveness of characters\nin drama. Our primary contribution is methodological; we introduce and evaluate\ntwo non-parametric methods to produce a summary statistic for character\ndistinctiveness that can be usefully applied and compared across languages and\ntimes. Our first method is based on bootstrap distances between 3-gram\nprobability distributions, the second (reminiscent of 'unmasking' techniques)\non word keyness curves. Both methods are validated and explored by applying\nthem to a reasonably large corpus (a subset of DraCor): we analyse 3301\ncharacters drawn from 2324 works, covering five centuries and four languages\n(French, German, Russian, and the works of Shakespeare). Both methods appear\nuseful; the 3-gram method is statistically more powerful but the word keyness\nmethod offers rich interpretability. Both methods are able to capture\nphonological differences such as accent or dialect, as well as broad\ndifferences in topic and lexical richness. Based on exploratory analysis, we\nfind that smaller characters tend to be more distinctive, and that women are\ncross-linguistically more distinctive than men, with this latter finding\ncarefully interrogated using multiple regression. This greater distinctiveness\nstems from a historical tendency for female characters to be restricted to an\n'internal narrative domain' covering mainly direct discourse and\nfamily/romantic themes. It is hoped that direct, comparable statistical\nmeasures will form a basis for more sophisticated future studies, and advances\nin theory.",

    "abstract": "Occurrence reporting is a commonly used method in safety management systems\nto obtain insight in the prevalence of hazards and accident scenarios. In\nsupport of safety data analysis, reports are often categorized according to a\ntaxonomy. However, the processing of the reports can require significant effort\nfrom safety analysts and a common problem is interrater variability in labeling\nprocesses. Also, in some cases, reports are not processed according to a\ntaxonomy, or the taxonomy does not fully cover the contents of the documents.\nThis paper explores various Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to\nsupport the analysis of aviation safety occurrence reports. In particular, the\nproblems studied are the automatic labeling of reports using a classification\nmodel, extracting the latent topics in a collection of texts using a topic\nmodel and the automatic generation of probable cause texts. Experimental\nresults showed that (i) under the right conditions the labeling of occurrence\nreports can be effectively automated with a transformer-based classifier, (ii)\ntopic modeling can be useful for finding the topics present in a collection of\nreports, and (iii) using a summarization model can be a promising direction for\ngenerating probable cause texts.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the empirical distribution of a scalar-valued data set is a basic\nand fundamental task. In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating an\nempirical distribution in a setting with two challenging features. First, the\nalgorithm does not directly observe the data; instead, it only asks a limited\nnumber of threshold queries about each sample. Second, the data are not assumed\nto be independent and identically distributed; instead, we allow for an\narbitrary process generating the samples, including an adaptive adversary.\nThese considerations are relevant, for example, when modeling a seller\nexperimenting with posted prices to estimate the distribution of consumers'\nwillingness to pay for a product: offering a price and observing a consumer's\npurchase decision is equivalent to asking a single threshold query about their\nvalue, and the distribution of consumers' values may be non-stationary over\ntime, as early adopters may differ markedly from late adopters.\nOur main result quantifies, to within a constant factor, the sample\ncomplexity of estimating the empirical CDF of a sequence of elements of $[n]$,\nup to $\\varepsilon$ additive error, using one threshold query per sample. The\ncomplexity depends only logarithmically on $n$, and our result can be\ninterpreted as extending the existing logarithmic-complexity results for noisy\nbinary search to the more challenging setting where noise is non-stochastic.\nAlong the way to designing our algorithm, we consider a more general model in\nwhich the algorithm is allowed to make a limited number of simultaneous\nthreshold queries on each sample. We solve this problem using Blackwell's\nApproachability Theorem and the exponential weights method. As a side result of\nindependent interest, we characterize the minimum number of simultaneous\nthreshold queries required by deterministic CDF estimation algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The standard approach to modeling the human brain as a complex system is with\na network, where the basic unit of interaction is a pairwise link between two\nbrain regions. While powerful, this approach is limited by the inability to\nassess higher-order interactions involving three or more elements directly. In\nthis work, we present a method for capturing higher-order dependencies in\ndiscrete data based on partial entropy decomposition (PED). Our approach\ndecomposes the joint entropy of the whole system into a set of strictly\nnon-negative partial entropy atoms that describe the redundant, unique, and\nsynergistic interactions that compose the system's structure. We begin by\nshowing how the PED can provide insights into the mathematical structure of\nboth the FC network itself, as well as established measures of higher-order\ndependency such as the O-information. When applied to resting state fMRI data,\nwe find robust evidence of higher-order synergies that are largely invisible to\nstandard functional connectivity analyses. This synergistic structure distinct\nfrom structural features based on redundancy that have previously dominated FC\nanalyses. Our approach can also be localized in time, allowing a frame-by-frame\nanalysis of how the distributions of redundancies and synergies change over the\ncourse of a recording. We find that different ensembles of regions can\ntransiently change from being redundancy-dominated to synergy-dominated, and\nthat the temporal pattern is structured in time. These results provide strong\nevidence that there exists a large space of unexplored structures in human\nbrain data that have been largely missed by a focus on bivariate network\nconnectivity models.

    "abstract": "Hybrid power plants comprising renewable power sources and electrolyzers are\nenvisioned to play a key role in accelerating the transition towards\ndecarbonization. It is common in the current literature to use simplified\noperational models for electrolyzers. It is still an open question whether this\nis a good practice, and if not, when a more detailed operational model is\nnecessary. This paper answers it by assessing the impact of adding different\nlevels of electrolyzer details, i.e., physics and operational constraints, to\nthe optimal dispatch problem of a hybrid power plant in the day-ahead time\nstage. Our focus lies on the number of operating states (on, off, standby) as\nwell as the number of linearization segments used for approximating the\nnon-linear hydrogen production curve. For that, we develop several\nmixed-integer linear models, each representing a different level of operational\ndetails. We conduct a thorough comparative ex-post performance analysis under\ndifferent price conditions, wind farm capacities, and minimum hydrogen demand\nrequirements, and discuss under which operational circumstances a detailed\nmodel is necessary. In particular, we provide a case under which a simplified\nmodel, compared to a detailed one, results in a decrease in profit of 1.8% and\nhydrogen production of 13.5% over a year. The key lesson learned is that a\ndetailed model potentially earns a higher profit in circumstances under which\nthe electrolyzer operates with partial loading. This could be the case for a\ncertain range of electricity and hydrogen prices, or limited wind power\navailability. The detailed model also provides a better estimation of true\nhydrogen production, facilitating the logistics required.",

    "abstract": "Feed-forward neural networks (NN) are a staple machine learning method widely\nused in many areas of science and technology. While even a single-hidden layer\nNN is a universal approximator, its expressive power is limited by the use of\nsimple neuron activation functions (such as sigmoid functions) that are\ntypically the same for all neurons. More flexible neuron activation functions\nwould allow using fewer neurons and layers and thereby save computational cost\nand improve expressive power. We show that additive Gaussian process regression\n(GPR) can be used to construct optimal neuron activation functions that are\nindividual to each neuron. An approach is also introduced that avoids\nnon-linear fitting of neural network parameters. The resulting method combines\nthe advantage of robustness of a linear regression with the higher expressive\npower of a NN. We demonstrate the approach by fitting the potential energy\nsurface of the water molecule. Without requiring any non-linear optimization,\nthe additive GPR based approach outperforms a conventional NN in the high\naccuracy regime, where a conventional NN suffers more from overfitting.",

    "abstract": "Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) based brain-computer interface\n(BCI) has received considerable attention due to its high transfer rate and\navailable quantity of targets. However, the performance of frequency\nidentification methods heavily hinges on the amount of user calibration data\nand data length, which hinders the deployment in real-world applications.\nRecently, generative adversarial networks (GANs)-based data generation methods\nhave been widely adopted to create supplementary synthetic\nelectroencephalography (EEG) data, holds promise to address these issues. In\nthis paper, we proposed a GAN-based end-to-end signal transformation network\nfor data length window extension, termed as TEGAN. TEGAN transforms short-time\nSSVEP signals into long-time artificial SSVEP signals. By incorporating a novel\nU-Net generator architecture and auxiliary classifier into the network design,\nthe TEGAN could produce conditioned features in the synthetic data.\nAdditionally, to regularize the training process of GAN, we introduced a\ntwo-stage training strategy and the LeCam-divergence regularization term during\nthe network implementation. The proposed TEGAN was evaluated on two public\nSSVEP datasets. With the assistance of TEGAN, the performance of traditional\nfrequency recognition methods and deep learning-based methods have been\nsignificantly improved under limited calibration data. This study substantiates\nthe feasibility of the proposed method to extend the data length for short-time\nSSVEP signals to develop a high-performance BCI system. The proposed GAN-based\nmethods have the great potential of shortening the calibration time for various\nreal-world BCI-based applications, while the novelty of our augmentation\nstrategies shed some value light on understanding the subject-invariant\nproperties of SSVEPs.",

However, a critical knowledge gap exists in\nterms of the extent to which socio-spatial networks shaped by human mobility\nexacerbate or alleviate urban heat exposures of populations in cities. In this\nstudy, we utilize location-based data to construct human mobility networks in\ntwenty metropolitan areas in the U.S. The human mobility networks are analyzed\nin conjunction with the urban heat characteristics of spatial areas. We\nidentify areas with high and low urban heat exposure and evaluate visitation\npatterns of populations residing in high and low urban heat areas to other\nspatial areas with similar and dissimilar urban heat exposure. The results\nreveal the presence of urban heat traps in the majority of the studied\nmetropolitan areas in which populations residing in high heat exposure areas\nprimarily visit areas with high heat exposure. The results also show a small\npercentage of human mobility to produce urban heat escalate (visitations from\nlow heat areas to high heat areas) and heat escapes (movements from high heat\nareas to low heat areas). The findings from this study provide a better\nunderstanding of urban heat exposure in cities based on patterns of human\nmobility. These finding contribute to a broader understanding of the\nintersection of human network dynamics and environmental hazard exposures in\ncities to inform more integrated urban design and planning to promote health\nand sustainability.",

While the application varies greatly, these devices are\nregularly used for performing board management tasks, making them a fundamental\nelement in the correct operation of the board. The large number of hundreds of\nSoC devices creates significant challenges in their firmware deployment,\nmaintenance, and accessibility. Even though U-Boot on ZUS+ devices supports\nnetwork boot through the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE), the standard ZUS+\nboot process contains application-specific information at earlier boot steps,\nparticularly within the First Stage Bootloader (FSBL). This prevents the\ninitialization of several devices from a universal image. Inspired by the PXE\nboot process on desktop PCs, this paper describes split boot, a novel boot\nmethod tailored to the specific needs of the ZUS+. All application-specific\nconfiguration is moved to a network storage device and automatically fetched\nduring the boot process. We considered the entire process, from firmware and\nsoftware development to binary distribution in a large-scale system.
