    "title": "The political ideology of conversational AI: Converging evidence on  ChatGPT's pro-environmental, left-libertarian orientation",
    "abstract": "Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) disrupts how humans interact with\ntechnology. Recently, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art dialogue\nmodel that can converse with its human counterparts with unprecedented\ncapabilities. ChatGPT has witnessed tremendous attention from the media,\nacademia, industry, and the general public, attracting more than a million\nusers within days of its release. However, its explosive adoption for\ninformation search and as an automated decision aid underscores the importance\nto understand its limitations and biases. This paper focuses on one of\ndemocratic society's most important decision-making processes: political\nelections. Prompting ChatGPT with 630 political statements from two leading\nvoting advice applications and the nation-agnostic political compass test in\nthree pre-registered experiments, we uncover ChatGPT's pro-environmental,\nleft-libertarian ideology. For example, ChatGPT would impose taxes on flights,\nrestrict rent increases, and legalize abortion. In the 2021 elections, it would\nhave voted most likely for the Greens both in Germany (B\\\"undnis 90/Die\nGr\\\"unen) and in the Netherlands (GroenLinks). Our findings are robust when\nnegating the prompts, reversing the order of the statements, varying prompt\nformality, and across languages (English, German, Dutch, and Spanish). We\nconclude by discussing the implications of politically biased conversational AI\non society.",

    "title": "MetaSecure: A Passwordless Authentication for the Metaverse",
    "abstract": "Metaverse in general holds a potential future for cyberspace. At the\nbeginning of Web 2.0, it was witnessed that people were signing in with various\npseudonyms or 'nyms', risking their online identities by increasing presence of\nfake accounts leading to difficulty in unique identification for different\nroles. However, in Web 3.0, the metaverse, a user's identity is tied to their\noriginal identity, where risking one poses a significant risk to the other.\nTherefore, this paper proposes a novel authentication system for securing\ndigital assets, online identity, avatars, and accounts called Metasecure where\na unique id for every entity or user to develop a human establishment is\nessential on a digital platform. The proposed passwordless system provides\nthree layers of security using device attestation, facial recognition and use\nof physical security keys, security keys, or smartcards in accordance to Fast\nIDentity Online (FIDO2) specifications. It provides SDKs for authentication on\nany system including VR/XR glasses, thus ensuring seamlessness in accessing\nservices in the Metaverse.",

    "abstract": "Different factors have effects on traffic crashes and crash-related injuries.\nThese factors include segment characteristics, crash-level characteristics,\noccupant level characteristics, environment characteristics, and vehicle level\ncharacteristics. There are several studies regarding these factors' effects on\ncrash injuries. However, limited studies have examined the effects of pre-crash\nevents on injuries, especially for curve-related crashes. The majority of\nprevious studies for curve-related crashes focused on the impact of geometric\nfeatures or street design factors. The current study tries to eliminate the\naforementioned shortcomings by considering important pre-crash events related\nfactors as selected variables and the number of vehicles with or without injury\nas the predicted variable. This research used CRSS data from the National\nHighway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which includes traffic\ncrash-related data for different states in the USA. The relationships are\nexplored using different machine learning algorithms like the random forest,\nC5.0, CHAID, Bayesian Network, Neural Network, C\\&R Tree, Quest, etc. The\nrandom forest and SHAP values are used to identify the most effective\nvariables. The C5.0 algorithm, which has the highest accuracy rate among the\nother algorithms, is used to develop the final model. Analysis results revealed\nthat the extent of the damage, critical pre-crash event, pre-impact location,\nthe trafficway description, roadway surface condition, the month of the crash,\nthe first harmful event, number of motor vehicles, attempted avoidance\nmaneuver, and roadway grade affect the number of vehicles with or without\ninjury in curve-related crashes.",

    "abstract": "The Transformer architecture yields state-of-the-art results in many tasks\nsuch as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), since the\nability to efficiently capture the precise long-range dependency coupling\nbetween input sequences. With this advanced capability, however, the quadratic\ntime complexity and high memory usage prevents the Transformer from dealing\nwith long time-series forecasting problem (LTFP). To address these\ndifficulties: (i) we revisit the learned attention patterns of the vanilla\nself-attention, redesigned the calculation method of self-attention based the\nMaximum Entropy Principle. (ii) we propose a new method to sparse the\nself-attention, which can prevent the loss of more important self-attention\nscores due to random sampling.(iii) We propose Keys/Values Distilling method\nmotivated that a large amount of feature in the original self-attention map is\nredundant, which can further reduce the time and spatial complexity and make it\npossible to input longer time-series. Finally, we propose a method that\ncombines the encoder-decoder architecture with seasonal-trend decomposition,\ni.e., using the encoder-decoder architecture to capture more specific seasonal\nparts. A large number of experiments on several large-scale datasets show that\nour Infomaxformer is obviously superior to the existing methods.

    "abstract": "Fair resource allocation is one of the most important topics in communication\nnetworks. Existing solutions almost exclusively assume each user utility\nfunction is known and concave. This paper seeks to answer the following\nquestion: how to allocate resources when utility functions are unknown, even to\nthe users? This answer has become increasingly important in the next-generation\nAI-aware communication networks where the user utilities are complex and their\nclosed-forms are hard to obtain. In this paper, we provide a new solution using\na distributed and data-driven bilevel optimization approach, where the lower\nlevel is a distributed network utility maximization (NUM) algorithm with\nconcave surrogate utility functions, and the upper level is a data-driven\nlearning algorithm to find the best surrogate utility functions that maximize\nthe sum of true network utility. The proposed algorithm learns from data\nsamples (utility values or gradient values) to autotune the surrogate utility\nfunctions to maximize the true network utility, so works for unknown utility\nfunctions. For the general network, we establish the nonasymptotic convergence\nrate of the proposed algorithm with nonconcave utility functions. The\nsimulations validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the great\neffectiveness of the proposed method in a real-world network.",

    "abstract": "Clustering data lying close to a union of low-dimensional manifolds, with\neach manifold as a cluster, is a fundamental problem in machine learning. When\nthe manifolds are assumed to be linear subspaces, many methods succeed using\nlow-rank and sparse priors, which have been studied extensively over the past\ntwo decades. Unfortunately, most real-world datasets can not be well\napproximated by linear subspaces. On the other hand, several works have\nproposed to identify the manifolds by learning a feature map such that the data\ntransformed by the map lie in a union of linear subspaces, even though the\noriginal data are from non-linear manifolds. However, most works either assume\nknowledge of the membership of samples to clusters, or are shown to learn\ntrivial representations. In this paper, we propose to simultaneously perform\nclustering and learn a union-of-subspace representation via Maximal Coding Rate\nReduction. Experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets show that the\nproposed method achieves clustering accuracy comparable with state-of-the-art\nalternatives, while being more scalable and learning geometrically meaningful\nrepresentations.",

In this\npaper we view the interaction between humans and ML systems within the broader\ncontext of interaction between agents capable of learning and explanation.\nWithin this setting, we argue that it is more helpful to view the interaction\nas characterised by two-way intelligibility of information rather than once-off\nexplanation of a prediction. We formulate two-way intelligibility as a property\nof a communication protocol. Development of the protocol is motivated by a set\nof `Intelligibility Axioms' for decision-support systems that use ML with a\nhuman-in-the-loop. The axioms are intended as sufficient criteria to claim\nthat: (a) information provided by a human is intelligible to an ML system; and\n(b) information provided by an ML system is intelligible to a human. The axioms\ninform the design of a general synchronous interaction model between agents\ncapable of learning and explanation.

Several strategies (e.g.,\nAdapters, prefix tuning, BitFit, and LoRA) have been proposed. However, their\ndesigns are hand-crafted separately, and it remains unclear whether certain\ndesign patterns exist for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Thus, we present a\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning design paradigm and discover design patterns\nthat are applicable to different experimental settings. Instead of focusing on\ndesigning another individual tuning strategy, we introduce parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning design spaces that parameterize tuning structures and tuning\nstrategies. Specifically, any design space is characterized by four components:\nlayer grouping, trainable parameter allocation, tunable groups, and strategy\nassignment. Starting from an initial design space, we progressively refine the\nspace based on the model quality of each design choice and make greedy\nselection at each stage over these four components. We discover the following\ndesign patterns: (i) group layers in a spindle pattern; (ii) allocate the\nnumber of trainable parameters to layers uniformly; (iii) tune all the groups;\n(iv) assign proper tuning strategies to different groups. These design patterns\nresult in new parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.

    "abstract": "Everyday, large amounts of sensitive data \\sai{is} distributed across mobile\nphones, wearable devices, and other sensors. Traditionally, these enormous\ndatasets have been processed on a single system, with complex models being\ntrained to make valuable predictions. Distributed machine learning techniques\nsuch as Federated and Split Learning have recently been developed to protect\nuser \\sai{data and} privacy better while ensuring high performance. Both of\nthese distributed learning architectures have advantages and disadvantages. In\nthis paper, we examine these tradeoffs and suggest a new hybrid Federated Split\nLearning architecture that combines the efficiency and privacy benefits of\nboth. Our evaluation demonstrates how our hybrid Federated Split Learning\napproach can lower the amount of processing power required by each client\nrunning a distributed learning system, reduce training and inference time while\nkeeping a similar accuracy. We also discuss the resiliency of our approach to\ndeep learning privacy inference attacks and compare our solution to other\nrecently proposed benchmarks.",

In the proposed\ncontrol strategy, the trajectory tracking component is formed by a refined\nbackstepping algorithm that controls the velocity variation and a sliding mode\ncontrol deducts the torque/force outputs; the fault-tolerant component is\nestablished based on a Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), which provides\nfast convergence speed as well as satisfactory accuracy of deducting optimized\nreallocation of the thruster forces to compensate for the power loss in\ndifferent fault cases.

    "abstract": "Sequential Bayesian inference can be used for continual learning to prevent\ncatastrophic forgetting of past tasks and provide an informative prior when\nlearning new tasks. We revisit sequential Bayesian inference and test whether\nhaving access to the true posterior is guaranteed to prevent catastrophic\nforgetting in Bayesian neural networks. To do this we perform sequential\nBayesian inference using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We propagate the posterior as\na prior for new tasks by fitting a density estimator on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo\nsamples. We find that this approach fails to prevent catastrophic forgetting\ndemonstrating the difficulty in performing sequential Bayesian inference in\nneural networks. From there we study simple analytical examples of sequential\nBayesian inference and CL and highlight the issue of model misspecification\nwhich can lead to sub-optimal continual learning performance despite exact\ninference. Furthermore, we discuss how task data imbalances can cause\nforgetting. From these limitations, we argue that we need probabilistic models\nof the continual learning generative process rather than relying on sequential\nBayesian inference over Bayesian neural network weights. In this vein, we also\npropose a simple baseline called Prototypical Bayesian Continual Learning,\nwhich is competitive with state-of-the-art Bayesian continual learning methods\non class incremental continual learning vision benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Implementing accurate Distribution System State Estimation (DSSE) faces\nseveral challenges, among which the lack of observability and the high density\nof the distribution system. While data-driven alternatives based on Machine\nLearning models could be a choice, they suffer in DSSE because of the lack of\nlabeled data. In fact, measurements in the distribution system are often noisy,\ncorrupted, and unavailable. To address these issues, we propose the Deep\nStatistical Solver for Distribution System State Estimation (DSS$^2$), a deep\nlearning model based on graph neural networks (GNNs) that accounts for the\nnetwork structure of the distribution system and for the physical governing\npower flow equations. DSS$^2$ leverages hypergraphs to represent the\nheterogeneous components of the distribution systems and updates their latent\nrepresentations via a node-centric message-passing scheme. A weakly supervised\nlearning approach is put forth to train the DSS$^2$ in a learning-to-optimize\nfashion w.r.t. the Weighted Least Squares loss with noisy measurements and\npseudomeasurements. By enforcing the GNN output into the power flow equations\nand the latter into the loss function, we force the DSS$^2$ to respect the\nphysics of the distribution system. This strategy enables learning from noisy\nmeasurements, acting as an implicit denoiser, and alleviating the need for\nideal labeled data. Extensive experiments with case studies on the IEEE 14-bus,\n70-bus, and 179-bus networks showed the DSS$^2$ outperforms by a margin the\nconventional Weighted Least Squares algorithm in accuracy, convergence, and\ncomputational time, while being more robust to noisy, erroneous, and missing\nmeasurements. The DSS$^2$ achieves a competing, yet lower, performance compared\nwith the supervised models that rely on the unrealistic assumption of having\nall the true labels.",

    "abstract": "Explainability is a key challenge and a major research theme in AI research\nfor developing intelligent systems that are capable of working with humans more\neffectively. An obvious choice in developing explainable intelligent systems\nrelies on employing knowledge representation formalisms which are inherently\ntailored towards expressing human knowledge e.g., interrogative agendas. In the\nscope of this work, we focus on formal concept analysis (FCA), a standard\nknowledge representation formalism, to express interrogative agendas, and in\nparticular to categorize objects w.r.t. a given set of features. Several\nFCA-based algorithms have already been in use for standard machine learning\ntasks such as classification and outlier detection. These algorithms use a\nsingle concept lattice for such a task, meaning that the set of features used\nfor the categorization is fixed. Different sets of features may have different\nimportance in that categorization, we call a set of features an agenda. In many\napplications a correct or good agenda for categorization is not known\nbeforehand. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning algorithm to construct a\ngood interrogative agenda explaining the data. Such algorithm is meant to call\nexisting FCA-based classification and outlier detection algorithms iteratively,\nto increase their accuracy and reduce their sample complexity. The proposed\nmethod assigns a measure of importance to different set of features used in the\ncategorization, hence making the results more explainable.",

    "abstract": "Recent rapid development of sensor technology has allowed massive\nfine-grained time series (TS) data to be collected and set the foundation for\nthe development of data-driven services and applications. During the process,\ndata sharing is often involved to allow the third-party modelers to perform\nspecific time series data mining (TSDM) tasks based on the need of data owner.\nThe high resolution of TS brings new challenges in protecting privacy. While\nmeaningful information in high-resolution TS shifts from concrete point values\nto local shape-based segments, numerous research have found that long\nshape-based patterns could contain more sensitive information and may\npotentially be extracted and misused by a malicious third party. However, the\nprivacy issue for TS patterns is surprisingly seldom explored in\nprivacy-preserving literature. In this work, we consider a new\nprivacy-preserving problem: preventing malicious inference on long shape-based\npatterns while preserving short segment information for the utility task\nperformance. To mitigate the challenge, we investigate an alternative approach\nby sharing Matrix Profile (MP), which is a non-linear transformation of\noriginal data and a versatile data structure that supports many data mining\ntasks. We found that while MP can prevent concrete shape leakage, the canonical\ncorrelation in MP index can still reveal the location of sensitive long\npattern. Based on this observation, we design two attacks named Location Attack\nand Entropy Attack to extract the pattern location from MP. To further protect\nMP from these two attacks, we propose a Privacy-Aware Matrix Profile (PMP) via\nperturbing the local correlation and breaking the canonical correlation in MP\nindex vector. We evaluate our proposed PMP against baseline noise-adding\nmethods through quantitative analysis and real-world case studies to show the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Understanding forest health is of great importance for the conservation of\nthe integrity of forest ecosystems. The monitoring of forest health is,\ntherefore, indispensable for the long-term conservation of forests and their\nsustainable management. In this regard, evaluating the amount and quality of\ndead wood is of utmost interest as they are favorable indicators of\nbiodiversity. Apparently, remote sensing-based machine learning techniques have\nproven to be more efficient and sustainable with unprecedented accuracy in\nforest inventory. However, the application of these techniques is still in its\ninfancy with respect to dead wood mapping. This study investigates for the\nfirst time the automatic classification of individual coniferous trees into\nfive decay stages (live, declining, dead, loose bark, and clean) from combined\nairborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds and CIR images using three Machine\nLearning methods - 3D point cloud-based deep learning (PointNet), Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN), and Random Forest (RF). All models achieved promising\nresults, reaching overall accuracy (OA) up to 90.9%, 90.6%, and 80.6% for CNN,\nRF, and PointNet, respectively. The experimental results reveal that the\nimage-based approach notably outperformed the 3D point cloud-based one, while\nspectral image texture is of the highest relevance to the success of\ncategorizing tree decay. Our models could therefore be used for automatic\ndetermination of single tree decay stages and landscape-wide assessment of dead\nwood amount and quality using modern airborne remote sensing techniques with\nmachine/deep learning.

    "abstract": "Detection of high impedance faults (HIF) has been one of the biggest\nchallenges in the power distribution network. The low current magnitude and\ndiverse characteristics of HIFs make them difficult to be detected by\nover-current relays. Recently, data-driven methods based on machine learning\nmodels are gaining popularity in HIF detection due to their capability to learn\ncomplex patterns from data. Most machine learning-based detection methods adopt\nsupervised learning techniques to distinguish HIFs from normal load conditions\nby performing classifications, which rely on a large amount of data collected\nduring HIF. However, measurements of HIF are difficult to acquire in the real\nworld. As a result, the reliability and generalization of the classification\nmethods are limited when the load profiles and faults are not present in the\ntraining data. Consequently, this paper proposes an unsupervised HIF detection\nframework using the autoencoder and principal component analysis-based\nmonitoring techniques. The proposed fault detection method detects the HIF by\nmonitoring the changes in correlation structure within the current waveforms\nthat are different from the normal loads. The performance of the proposed HIF\ndetection method is tested using real data collected from a 4.16 kV\ndistribution system and compared with results from a commercially available\nsolution for HIF detection. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms the commercially available HIF detection technique while\nmaintaining high security by not falsely detecting during load conditions.",

    "abstract": "Given an untrimmed video, temporal sentence localization (TSL) aims to\nlocalize a specific segment according to a given sentence query. Though\nrespectable works have made decent achievements in this task, they severely\nrely on dense video frame annotations, which require a tremendous amount of\nhuman effort to collect. In this paper, we target another more practical and\nchallenging setting: one-shot temporal sentence localization (one-shot TSL),\nwhich learns to retrieve the query information among the entire video with only\none annotated frame. Particularly, we propose an effective and novel\ntree-structure baseline for one-shot TSL, called Multiple Hypotheses Segment\nTree (MHST), to capture the query-aware discriminative frame-wise information\nunder the insufficient annotations. Each video frame is taken as the leaf-node,\nand the adjacent frames sharing the same visual-linguistic semantics will be\nmerged into the upper non-leaf node for tree building. At last, each root node\nis an individual segment hypothesis containing the consecutive frames of its\nleaf-nodes. During the tree construction, we also introduce a pruning strategy\nto eliminate the interference of query-irrelevant nodes. With our designed\nself-supervised loss functions, our MHST is able to generate high-quality\nsegment hypotheses for ranking and selection with the query. Experiments on two\nchallenging datasets demonstrate that MHST achieves competitive performance\ncompared to existing methods.",

    "abstract": "One major issue that challenges person re-identification (Re-ID) is the\nubiquitous occlusion over the captured persons. There are two main challenges\nfor the occluded person Re-ID problem, i.e., the interference of noise during\nfeature matching and the loss of pedestrian information brought by the\nocclusions. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Feature Recovery\nTransformer (FRT) to address the two challenges simultaneously, which mainly\nconsists of visibility graph matching and feature recovery transformer. To\nreduce the interference of the noise during feature matching, we mainly focus\non visible regions that appear in both images and develop a visibility graph to\ncalculate the similarity. In terms of the second challenge, based on the\ndeveloped graph similarity, for each query image, we propose a recovery\ntransformer that exploits the feature sets of its $k$-nearest neighbors in the\ngallery to recover the complete features. Extensive experiments across\ndifferent person Re-ID datasets, including occluded, partial and holistic\ndatasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of FRT. Specifically, FRT significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art results by at least 6.2\\% Rank-1 accuracy and\n7.2\\% mAP scores on the challenging Occluded-Duke dataset.

    "abstract": "Video instance segmentation (VIS) aims at segmenting and tracking objects in\nvideos. Prior methods typically generate frame-level or clip-level object\ninstances first and then associate them by either additional tracking heads or\ncomplex instance matching algorithms. This explicit instance association\napproach increases system complexity and fails to fully exploit temporal cues\nin videos. In this paper, we design a simple, fast and yet effective\nquery-based framework for online VIS. Relying on an instance query and proposal\npropagation mechanism with several specially developed components, this\nframework can perform accurate instance association implicitly. Specifically,\nwe generate frame-level object instances based on a set of instance\nquery-proposal pairs propagated from previous frames. This instance\nquery-proposal pair is learned to bind with one specific object across frames\nthrough conscientiously developed strategies. When using such a pair to predict\nan object instance on the current frame, not only the generated instance is\nautomatically associated with its precursors on previous frames, but the model\ngets a good prior for predicting the same object. In this way, we naturally\nachieve implicit instance association in parallel with segmentation and\nelegantly take advantage of temporal clues in videos. To show the effectiveness\nof our method InsPro, we evaluate it on two popular VIS benchmarks, i.e.,\nYouTube-VIS 2019 and YouTube-VIS 2021. Without bells-and-whistles, our InsPro\nwith ResNet-50 backbone achieves 43.2 AP and 37.6 AP on these two benchmarks\nrespectively, outperforming all other online VIS methods.",

Our algorithm allows to combine several BA complementation\nprocedures together, with one procedure for a subset of the BA's strongly\nconnected components (SCCs). In this way, one can exploit the structure of\nparticular SCCs (such as when they are inherently weak or deterministic) and\nuse more efficient specialized algorithms, regardless of the structure of the\nwhole BA. We give a general framework into which partial complementation\nprocedures can be plugged in, and its instantiation with several algorithms.\nThe framework can, in general, produce a complement with an Emerson-Lei\nacceptance condition, which can often be more compact. Using the algorithm, we\nwere able to establish an exponentially better new upper bound of $O(4n)$ for\ncomplementation of the recently introduced class of elevator automata.

    "abstract": "Increasing computational power and improving deep learning methods have made\ncomputer vision technologies pervasively common in urban environments. Their\napplications in policing, traffic management, and documenting public spaces are\nincreasingly common.

There is\na lack of context, depth, and specificity in these practices that enables\nsemantic knowledge or analysis within urban contexts, especially within the\ncontext of using and occupying urban space. This paper will critique existing\nuses of artificial intelligence and computer vision in urban practices to\npropose a new framework for understanding people, action, and public space.\nThis paper revisits Geertz's use of thick descriptions in generating\ninterpretive theories of culture and activity and uses this lens to establish a\nframework to evaluate the varied uses of computer vision technologies that\nweigh meaning.

    "abstract": "Application of the replica exchange (i.e., parallel tempering) technique to\nLangevin Monte Carlo algorithms, especially stochastic gradient Langevin\ndynamics (SGLD), has scored great success in non-convex learning problems, but\none potential limitation is the computational cost caused by running multiple\nchains. Upon observing that a large variance of the gradient estimator in SGLD\nessentially increases the temperature of the stationary distribution, we\npropose expediting tempering schemes for SGLD by directly estimating the bias\ncaused by the stochastic gradient estimator. This simple idea enables us to\nsimulate high-temperature chains at a negligible computational cost (compared\nto that of the low-temperature chain) while preserving the convergence to the\ntarget distribution. Our method is fundamentally different from the recently\nproposed m-reSGLD (multi-variance replica exchange SGLD) method in that the\nlatter suffers from the low accuracy of the gradient estimator (e.g., the chain\ncan fail to converge to the target) while our method benefits from it. Further,\nwe derive a swapping rate that can be easily evaluated, providing another\nsignificant improvement over m-reSGLD. To theoretically demonstrate the\nadvantage of our method, we develop convergence bounds in Wasserstein\ndistances.

However, most SNN hardware\nimplementations for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) cannot meet\narithmetic or memory efficiency requirements, which significantly restricts the\ndevelopment of SNNs. They do not delve into the arithmetic operations between\nthe binary spikes and synaptic weights or assume unlimited on-chip RAM\nresources by using overly expensive devices on small tasks.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a reactive planning system that allows a Cassie-series\nbipedal robot to avoid multiple non-overlapping obstacles via a single,\ncontinuously differentiable control barrier function (CBF). The overall system\ndetects an individual obstacle via a height map derived from a LiDAR point\ncloud and computes an elliptical outer approximation, which is then turned into\na CBF. The QP-CLF-CBF formalism developed by Ames et al. is applied to ensure\nthat safe trajectories are generated. Liveness is ensured by an analysis of\ninduced equilibrium points that are distinct from the goal state. Safe planning\nin environments with multiple obstacles is demonstrated both in simulation and\nexperimentally on the Cassie biped.",

    "abstract": "When educational institutions worldwide scrambled for ways to continue their\nclasses during lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of\ninformation and communication technology (ICT) for remote teaching has become\nwidely considered to be a potential solution. As universities raced to\nimplement emergency remote teaching (ERT) strategies in Japan, some have\nexplored innovative interventions other than webinar platforms and learning\nmanagement systems to bridge the gap caused by restricted mobility among\nteachers and learners. One such innovation is virtual reality (VR). VR has been\nchanging the landscape of higher education because of its ability to \"teleport\"\nlearners to various places by simulating real-world environments in the virtual\nworld. Some teachers, including the authors of this paper, explored integrating\nVR into their activities to address issues caused by geographical limitations\nbrought about by the heightened restrictions in 2020. Results were largely\nencouraging. However, rules started relaxing in the succeeding years as more\npeople got vaccinated. Thus, some fully online classes in Japan shifted to\nblended learning as they moved toward fully returning to in-person classes\nprompting educators to modify how they implemented their VR-based\ninterventions. This paper describes how a class of university students in Japan\nwho were taking a Filipino language course experienced a VR-based intervention\nin blended mode, which was originally prototyped during the peak of the ERT\nera. Moreover, adjustments and comparisons regarding methodological\nidiosyncrasies and findings between the fully online iteration and the recently\nimplemented blended one are reported in detail.",

    "abstract": "Constraint programming is known for being an efficient approach for solving\ncombinatorial problems. Important design choices in a solver are the branching\nheuristics, which are designed to lead the search to the best solutions in a\nminimum amount of time. However, developing these heuristics is a\ntime-consuming process that requires problem-specific expertise. This\nobservation has motivated many efforts to use machine learning to automatically\nlearn efficient heuristics without expert intervention. To the best of our\nknowledge, it is still an open research question. Although several generic\nvariable-selection heuristics are available in the literature, the options for\na generic value-selection heuristic are more scarce. In this paper, we propose\nto tackle this issue by introducing a generic learning procedure that can be\nused to obtain a value-selection heuristic inside a constraint programming\nsolver. This has been achieved thanks to the combination of a deep Q-learning\nalgorithm, a tailored reward signal, and a heterogeneous graph neural network\narchitecture. Experiments on graph coloring, maximum independent set, and\nmaximum cut problems show that our framework is able to find better solutions\nclose to optimality without requiring a large amounts of backtracks while being\ngeneric.",

    "abstract": "A Samll Moving Object Detection algorithm Based on Motion Information\n(SMOD-BMI) was proposed to detect small moving objects with low Signal-to-Noise\nRatio (SNR). Firstly, To capture suspicious moving objects, a ConvLSTM-SCM-PAN\nmodel structure was designed, in which the Convolutional Long and Short Time\nMemory (ConvLSTM) network fused temporal and spatial information, the Selective\nConcatenate Module (SCM) was selected to solve the problem of channel unbalance\nduring feature fusion, and the Path Aggregation Network (PAN) located the\nsuspicious moving objects. Then, an object tracking algorithm is used to track\nsuspicious moving objects and calculate their Motion Range (MR). At the same\ntime, according to the moving speed of the suspicious moving objects, the size\nof their MR is adjusted adaptively (To be specific, if the objects move slowly,\nwe expand their MR according their speed to ensure the contextual environment\ninformation) to obtain their Adaptive Candidate Motion Range (ACMR), so as to\nensure that the SNR of the moving object is improved while the necessary\ncontext information is retained adaptively. Finally, a LightWeight SCM U-Shape\nNet (LW-SCM-USN) based on ACMR with a SCM module is designed to classify and\nlocate small moving objects accurately and quickly. In this paper, the moving\nbird in surveillance video is used as the experimental dataset to verify the\nperformance of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed\nsmall moving object detection method based on motion information can\neffectively reduce the missing rate and false detection rate, and its\nperformance is better than the existing moving small object detection method of\nSOTA.",

The\nadvanced spectral and spatial specification of the recently launched DESIS (the\nDLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer) instrument provides a unique\nopportunity to test the potential for monitoring plant species diversity with\nspaceborne hyperspectral data. This study provides a quantitative assessment on\nthe ability of DESIS hyperspectral data for predicting plant species richness\nin two different habitat types in southeast Australia. Spectral features were\nfirst extracted from the DESIS spectra, then regressed against on-ground\nestimates of plant species richness, with a two-fold cross validation scheme to\nassess the predictive performance. We tested and compared the effectiveness of\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA), Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and\nPartial Least Squares analysis (PLS) for feature extraction, and Kernel Ridge\nRegression (KRR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Random Forest Regression\n(RFR) for species richness prediction.

Relative importance analysis for the DESIS spectral\nbands showed that the red-edge, red, and blue spectral regions were more\nimportant for predicting plant species richness than the green bands and the\nnear-infrared bands beyond red-edge.

We observe that face recognition models pretrained on a large\ndataset and naively fine-tuned models perform poorly for this task.

Computer aided diagnosis frameworks are utilized to relieve\npathologist workload by classifying the data automatically, in which deep\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) are effective solutions. The features\nextracted from activation layer of pre-trained CNNs are called deep\nconvolutional activation features (DeCAF). In this paper, we have analyzed that\nall DeCAF features are not necessarily led to a higher accuracy in the\nclassification task and dimension reduction plays an important role. Therefore,\ndifferent dimension reduction methods are applied to achieve an effective\ncombination of features by capturing the essence of DeCAF features. To this\npurpose, we have proposed reduced deep convolutional activation features\n(R-DeCAF). In this framework, pre-trained CNNs such as AlexNet, VGG-16 and\nVGG-19 are utilized in transfer learning mode as feature extractors. DeCAF\nfeatures are extracted from the first fully connected layer of the mentioned\nCNNs and support vector machine has been used for binary classification.

In the first experiment, we train three random\nforests using the sounds that make up the names of Japanese, Chinese, and\nKorean Pokemon to classify Pokemon into pre-evolution and post-evolution\ncategories. We then train a fourth random forest using the results of an\nelicitation experiment whereby Japanese participants named previously unseen\nPokemon. In Experiment 2, we reproduce those random forests with name length as\na feature and compare the performance of the random forests against humans in a\nclassification experiment whereby Japanese participants classified the names\nelicited in Experiment 1 into pre-and post-evolution categories. Experiment 2\nreveals an issue pertaining to overfitting in Experiment 1 which we resolve\nusing a novel cross-validation method. The results show that the random forests\nare efficient learners of systematic sound-meaning correspondence patterns and\ncan classify samples with greater accuracy than the human participants.",

In this paper, we\npropose a Situated Conversation Agent Petrained with Multimodal Questions from\nINcremental Layout Graph (SPRING) with abilities of reasoning multi-hops\nspatial relations and connecting them with visual attributes in crowded\nsituated scenarios. Specifically, we design two types of Multimodal Question\nAnswering (MQA) tasks to pretrain the agent. All QA pairs utilized during\npretraining are generated from novel Incremental Layout Graphs (ILG). QA pair\ndifficulty labels automatically annotated by ILG are used to promote MQA-based\nCurriculum Learning.

    "abstract": "Aligning objects with words plays a critical role in Image-Language BERT\n(IL-BERT) and Video-Language BERT (VDL-BERT). Different from the image case\nwhere an object covers some spatial patches, an object in a video usually\nappears as an object trajectory, i.e., it spans over a few spatial but longer\ntemporal patches and thus contains abundant spatiotemporal contexts. However,\nmodern VDL-BERTs neglect this trajectory characteristic that they usually\nfollow IL-BERTs to deploy the patch-to-word (P2W) attention while such\nattention may over-exploit trivial spatial contexts and neglect significant\ntemporal contexts. To amend this, we propose a novel TW-BERT to learn\nTrajectory-Word alignment for solving video-language tasks. Such alignment is\nlearned by a newly designed trajectory-to-word (T2W) attention. Besides T2W\nattention, we also follow previous VDL-BERTs to set a word-to-patch (W2P)\nattention in the cross-modal encoder. Since T2W and W2P attentions have diverse\nstructures, our cross-modal encoder is asymmetric. To further help this\nasymmetric cross-modal encoder build robust vision-language associations, we\npropose a fine-grained ``align-before-fuse'' strategy to pull close the\nembedding spaces calculated by the video and text encoders. By the proposed\nstrategy and T2W attention, our TW-BERT achieves SOTA performances on\ntext-to-video retrieval tasks, and comparable performances on video question\nanswering tasks with some VDL-BERTs trained on much more data.

We use this name since each layer of ACF\ncan adaptively cluster input elements to carry self-attention (Self-ATT) for\nlearning local context. Compared with other global-local Transformers which\ncarry Self-ATT in fixed-size windows, ACF can capture varying graininess, \\eg,\nan object may cover different numbers of grids or a phrase may contain diverse\nnumbers of words. To build ACF, we insert a probabilistic matrix C into the\nSelf-ATT layer. For an input sequence {{s}_1,...,{s}_N , C_{i,j} softly\ndetermines whether the sub-sequence {s_i,...,s_j} should be clustered for\ncarrying Self-ATT. For implementation, {C}_{i,j} is calculated from the\ncontexts of {{s}_i,...,{s}_j}, thus ACF can exploit the input itself to decide\nwhich local contexts should be learned. By using ACF to build the vision\nencoder and language decoder, the captioning model can automatically discover\nthe hidden structures in both vision and language, which encourages the model\nto learn a unified structural space for transferring more structural\ncommonalities.

We found that the local features are insufficient to FS-UDA, which\ncould introduce noise or bias against classification, and not be used to\neffectively align the domains. To address the above issues, we aim to refine\nthe local features to be more discriminative and relevant to classification.\nThus, we propose a novel task-specific semantic feature learning method (TSECS)\nfor FS-UDA.

We frame the problem using scaling analysis,\nresulting in a control framework robust against material and geometric changes.\nPath planning is carried out over the generated manifold to produce robot\nmanipulation trajectories optimized to prevent sliding.

The\nexisting works which employ standard detection framework and fixed\npseudo-labelling mechanism (PLM) have the following problems: (i) The inclusion\nof detecting unknown objects substantially reduces the model's ability to\ndetect known ones. (ii) The PLM does not adequately utilize the priori\nknowledge of inputs. (iii) The fixed selection manner of PLM cannot guarantee\nthat the model is trained in the right direction.

Moreover, we propose new\nindicators to quantify the activeness and value of NFT and propose an algorithm\nthat combines indicators and graph analyses to find bubble NFTs. Real-world\ncases demonstrate that our indicators and approach can be used to discern\nbubble NFTs effectively.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we formulate inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) as an\nexpert-learner interaction whereby the optimal performance intent of an expert\nor target agent is unknown to a learner agent. The learner observes the states\nand controls of the expert and hence seeks to reconstruct the expert's cost\nfunction intent and thus mimics the expert's optimal response. Next, we add\nnon-cooperative disturbances that seek to disrupt the learning and stability of\nthe learner agent. This leads to the formulation of a new interaction we call\nzero-sum game IRL. We develop a framework to solve the zero-sum game IRL\nproblem that is a modified extension of RL policy iteration (PI) to allow\nunknown expert performance intentions to be computed and non-cooperative\ndisturbances to be rejected. The framework has two parts: a value function and\ncontrol action update based on an extension of PI, and a cost function update\nbased on standard inverse optimal control. Then, we eventually develop an\noff-policy IRL algorithm that does not require knowledge of the expert and\nlearner agent dynamics and performs single-loop learning. Rigorous proofs and\nanalyses are given. Finally, simulation experiments are presented to show the\neffectiveness of the new approach.",

Building on the recent success of\ndifferentiable sorting algorithms, group ordering constraints enforce that the\ndistances of all positive samples (a positive group) are smaller than the\ndistances of all negative images (a negative group); thus, enforcing positive\nsamples to gather around an anchor. This leads to a more holistic optimization\nof the local neighborhoods. We evaluate the proposed setting on a suite of\ncompetitive self-supervised learning benchmarks and show that our method is not\nonly competitive to current methods in the case of linear probing but also\nleads to higher consistency in local representations, as can be seen from a\nsignificantly improved k-NN performance across all benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "We propose an effective lightweight dynamic local and global self-attention\nnetwork (DLGSANet) to solve image super-resolution. Our method explores the\nproperties of Transformers while having low computational costs. Motivated by\nthe network designs of Transformers, we develop a simple yet effective\nmulti-head dynamic local self-attention (MHDLSA) module to extract local\nfeatures efficiently. In addition, we note that existing Transformers usually\nexplore all similarities of the tokens between the queries and keys for the\nfeature aggregation. However, not all the tokens from the queries are relevant\nto those in keys, using all the similarities does not effectively facilitate\nthe high-resolution image reconstruction. To overcome this problem, we develop\na sparse global self-attention (SparseGSA) module to select the most useful\nsimilarity values so that the most useful global features can be better\nutilized for the high-resolution image reconstruction. We develop a hybrid\ndynamic-Transformer block(HDTB) that integrates the MHDLSA and SparseGSA for\nboth local and global feature exploration. To ease the network training, we\nformulate the HDTBs into a residual hybrid dynamic-Transformer group (RHDTG).\nBy embedding the RHDTGs into an end-to-end trainable network, we show that our\nproposed method has fewer network parameters and lower computational costs\nwhile achieving competitive performance against state-of-the-art ones in terms\nof accuracy.

For the case that the beam width is relatively\nlarger than the detection aperture, we propose the three kinds of models that\nhave the form of $c_1\\exp(-c_2r^2) $.It is shown that the modified intensity\nuniform model not only achieves a comparable accuracy with the best linearized\nmodel, but also is expressed in an elegant mathematical way when compared to\nthe traditional Fraid model. This indicates that the modified intensity uniform\nmodel is preferable in the performance analysis of free space optical (FSO)\nsystems that consider the effects of the pointing errors. By analogizing the\nbeam spot with a point in the case that beam width is smaller than the\ndetection aperture, the solution of the pointing errors model is transformed to\na smooth function approximation problem, and we find that a more accurate\napproximation can be achieved by the proposed point approximation model when\ncompared to the model that is induced from the Vasylyev model in some\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "Basic abstraction principles are reached through ontology, which was\ntraditionally conceived as a depiction of the world itself. Ontology is also\ndescribed using conceptual modeling (CM) that defines fundamental concepts of\nreality. CM is one of the central activities in computer science, especially as\nit is mainly used in software engineering as an intermediate artifact for\nsystem construction. To achieve such a goal, we propose Stoic CM (SCM) as a\ndescription of what a system must do functionally with minimal ambiguity. As a\ncase study, we apply SCM to investigate the ontology of BPMN (business process\nmodeling notation). Such an undertaking would demonstrate SCM notions and\nsimultaneously may offer a viable ontological foundation for BPMN. SCM defines\nthe being of things and actions in reality based on Stoic notions of existence\nand subsistence. It has two levels of specification: (1) a subsistence static\nmodel where things and actions subsist and (2) an existence dynamic model where\nthings and actions exist in time. From the Stoic ontological point of view,\nwhile a thing existing has a clear denotation, subsistence indicates the thing\nis being there, but it is inactive (does not participate in an event). We apply\nSCM to BPMN processes that involve buying a new car with many notions, such as\nactivity, task, event, and message. The result indicates that SCM produces a\ntighter representation of reality, thus providing the necessary description of\nthe part in the application world to be used as requirements for developing the\nsoftware system.",

Since distracted driving is already one of\nthe main causes of fatal accidents, in-vehicle touchscreen Human-Machine\nInterfaces (HMIs) must be as little distracting as possible. To ensure that\nthese systems are safe to use, they undergo elaborate and expensive empirical\ntesting, requiring fully functional prototypes. Thus, early-stage methods\ninforming designers about the implication their design may have on driver\ndistraction are of great value. This paper presents a machine learning method\nthat, based on anticipated usage scenarios, predicts the visual demand of\nin-vehicle touchscreen interactions and provides local and global explanations\nof the factors influencing drivers' visual attention allocation. The approach\nis based on large-scale natural driving data continuously collected from\nproduction line vehicles and employs the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP)\nmethod to provide explanations leveraging informed design decisions. Our\napproach is more accurate than related work and identifies interactions during\nwhich long glances occur with 68 % accuracy and predicts the total glance\nduration with a mean error of 2.4 s. Our explanations replicate the results of\nvarious recent studies and provide fast and easily accessible insights into the\neffect of UI elements, driving automation, and vehicle speed on driver\ndistraction.

The space\ndiscretization is performed by the loworder nonconforming Rannacher-Turek\nfinite element: the scalar unknowns are associated to the cells of the mesh,\nwhile the velocities unknowns are associated to the edges or faces. The\nmomentum convection operator is of finite volume type, and its almost second\norder expression is derived by a MUSCL-like technique. The latter is of\nalgebraic type, in the sense that the limitation procedure does not invoke any\nslope reconstruction, and is independent from the geometry of the cells. The\nderived discrete convection operator applies both to constant or variable\ndensity flows, and may thus be implemented in a scheme for incompressible or\ncompressible flows.

    "abstract": "A decentralized identity system that can provide users with self-sovereign\ndigital identities to facilitate complete control over their own data is\nparamount to Web 3.0. The accounting system on blockchain is an ideal archetype\nfor realizing Web 3.0 decentralized identity: users can create their accounts\nwithout registering with a central agent. Such an identity system is endowed\nwith anonymity property: nobody knows the account's owner because the\nrelationship between an account and the owner is invisible. Thus, user privacy\nis well protected even though the account's data is public. However, a\ndisadvantage of such complete anonymity is that users can create multiple\naccounts without authentication to obfuscate their activities on the\nblockchain. In particular, the current anonymous blockchain account system\ncannot accurately register the social relationships and interactions between\nreal human users, given the amorphous mappings between users and blockchain\nidentities. Mistrust can be a major hurdle to the large-scale deployment of Web\n3.0. This work proposes ZKBID, a zero-knowledge blockchain-account-based Web\n3.0 decentralized identity scheme, to overcome endemic mistrust in blockchain\naccount systems. ZKBID links souls (blockchain accounts) to humans (users) in a\none-to-one manner to truly reflect the societal relationships and interactions\nbetween humans on the blockchain. With ZKBID, the users are accountable for\ntheir accounts anonymously, preserving privacy. ZKBID authenticates users using\nface match and then maps authenticated users to accounts. Zero-knowledge proofs\nencode the face match results, and user-account mappings employ linkable ring\nsignatures to preserve anonymity. We implemented ZKBID and built a blockchain\ntest network for evaluation purposes. Our tests demonstrate the effectiveness\nof ZKBID and suggest proper ways to configure ZKBID system parameters.",

    "title": "FICE: Text-Conditioned Fashion Image Editing With Guided GAN Inversion",
    "abstract": "Fashion-image editing represents a challenging computer vision task, where\nthe goal is to incorporate selected apparel into a given input image. Most\nexisting techniques, known as Virtual Try-On methods, deal with this task by\nfirst selecting an example image of the desired apparel and then transferring\nthe clothing onto the target person. Conversely, in this paper, we consider\nediting fashion images with text descriptions. Such an approach has several\nadvantages over example-based virtual try-on techniques, e.g.: (i) it does not\nrequire an image of the target fashion item, and (ii) it allows the expression\nof a wide variety of visual concepts through the use of natural language.\nExisting image-editing methods that work with language inputs are heavily\nconstrained by their requirement for training sets with rich attribute\nannotations or they are only able to handle simple text descriptions. We\naddress these constraints by proposing a novel text-conditioned editing model,\ncalled FICE (Fashion Image CLIP Editing), capable of handling a wide variety of\ndiverse text descriptions to guide the editing procedure. Specifically with\nFICE, we augment the common GAN inversion process by including semantic,\npose-related, and image-level constraints when generating images. We leverage\nthe capabilities of the CLIP model to enforce the semantics, due to its\nimpressive image-text association capabilities. We furthermore propose a\nlatent-code regularization technique that provides the means to better control\nthe fidelity of the synthesized images. We validate FICE through rigorous\nexperiments on a combination of VITON images and Fashion-Gen text descriptions\nand in comparison with several state-of-the-art text-conditioned image editing\napproaches. Experimental results demonstrate FICE generates highly realistic\nfashion images and leads to stronger editing performance than existing\ncompeting approaches.",

However, success in scientific discovery\ntasks is limited by the accessibility of well-defined and labeled in-domain\ndata. To tackle the low-data constraint, recent adaptions of deep learning\nmodels pretrained on millions of protein sequences have shown promise; however,\nthe construction of such domain-specific large-scale model is computationally\nexpensive. Here, we propose Representation Learning via Dictionary Learning\n(R2DL), an end-to-end representation learning framework in which we reprogram\ndeep models for alternate-domain tasks that can perform well on protein\nproperty prediction with significantly fewer training samples. R2DL reprograms\na pretrained English language model to learn the embeddings of protein\nsequences, by learning a sparse linear mapping between English and protein\nsequence vocabulary embeddings. Our model can attain better accuracy and\nsignificantly improve the data efficiency by up to $10^5$ times over the\nbaselines set by pretrained and standard supervised methods. To this end, we\nreprogram an off-the-shelf pre-trained English language transformer and\nbenchmark it on a set of protein physicochemical prediction tasks (secondary\nstructure, stability, homology, stability) as well as on a biomedically\nrelevant set of protein function prediction tasks (antimicrobial, toxicity,\nantibody affinity).",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging aims to detect and localize\narbitrary anomalies without requiring annotated anomalous data during training.\nOften, this is achieved by learning a data distribution of normal samples and\ndetecting anomalies as regions in the image which deviate from this\ndistribution. Most current state-of-the-art methods use latent variable\ngenerative models operating directly on the images. However, generative models\nhave been shown to mostly capture low-level features, s.a. pixel-intensities,\ninstead of rich semantic features, which also applies to their representations.\nWe circumvent this problem by proposing CRADL whose core idea is to model the\ndistribution of normal samples directly in the low-dimensional representation\nspace of an encoder trained with a contrastive pretext-task. By utilizing the\nrepresentations of contrastive learning, we aim to fix the over-fixation on\nlow-level features and learn more semantic-rich representations. Our\nexperiments on anomaly detection and localization tasks using three distinct\nevaluation datasets show that 1) contrastive representations are superior to\nrepresentations of generative latent variable models and 2) the CRADL framework\nshows competitive or superior performance to state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial team games model multiplayer strategic interactions in which a\nteam of identically-interested players is competing against an adversarial\nplayer in a zero-sum game. Such games capture many well-studied settings in\ngame theory, such as congestion games, but go well-beyond to environments\nwherein the cooperation of one team -- in the absence of explicit communication\n-- is obstructed by competing entities; the latter setting remains poorly\nunderstood despite its numerous applications. Since the seminal work of Von\nStengel and Koller (GEB `97), different solution concepts have received\nattention from an algorithmic standpoint. Yet, the complexity of the standard\nNash equilibrium has remained open.\nIn this paper, we settle this question by showing that computing a Nash\nequilibrium in adversarial team games belongs to the class continuous local\nsearch (CLS), thereby establishing CLS-completeness by virtue of the recent\nCLS-hardness result of Rubinstein and Babichenko (STOC `21) in potential games.\nTo do so, we leverage linear programming duality to prove that any\n$\\epsilon$-approximate stationary strategy for the team can be extended in\npolynomial time to an $O(\\epsilon)$-approximate Nash equilibrium, where the\n$O(\\cdot)$ notation suppresses polynomial factors in the description of the\ngame.

    "abstract": "The evolution of the retail business presents new challenges and raises\npivotal questions on how to reinvent stores and supply chains to meet the\ngrowing demand of the online channel. One of the recent measures adopted by\nomnichannel retailers is to address the growth of online sales using in-store\npicking, which allows serving online orders using existing assets. However, it\ncomes with the downside of harming the offline customer experience. To achieve\npicking policies adapted to the dynamic customer flows of a retail store, we\nformalize a new problem called Dynamic In-store Picker Routing Problem (diPRP).\nIn this relevant problem - diPRP - a picker tries to pick online orders while\nminimizing customer encounters. We model the problem as a Markov Decision\nProcess (MDP) and solve it using a hybrid solution approach comprising\nmathematical programming and reinforcement learning components. Computational\nexperiments on synthetic instances suggest that the algorithm converges to\nefficient policies. Furthermore, we apply our approach in the context of a\nlarge European retailer to assess the results of the proposed policies\nregarding the number of orders picked and customers encountered. Our work\nsuggests that retailers should be able to scale the in-store picking of online\norders without jeopardizing the experience of offline customers. The policies\nlearned using the proposed solution approach reduced the number of customer\nencounters by more than 50% when compared to policies solely focused on picking\norders. Thus, to pursue omnichannel strategies that adequately trade-off\noperational efficiency and customer experience, retailers cannot rely on actual\nsimplistic picking strategies, such as choosing the shortest possible route.",

    "abstract": "Face presentation attack detection (PAD) plays a pivotal role in securing\nface recognition systems against spoofing attacks. Although great progress has\nbeen made in designing face PAD methods, developing a model that can generalize\nwell to an unseen test domain remains a significant challenge. Moreover, due to\ndifferent types of spoofing attacks, creating a dataset with a sufficient\nnumber of samples for training deep neural networks is a laborious task. This\nwork addresses these challenges by creating synthetic data and introducing a\ndeep learning-based unified framework for improving the generalization ability\nof the face PAD. In particular, synthetic data is generated by proposing a\nvideo distillation technique that blends a spatiotemporal warped image with a\nstill image based on alpha compositing. Since the proposed synthetic samples\ncan be generated by increasing different alpha weights, we train multiple\nclassifiers by taking the advantage of a specific type of ensemble learning\nknown as a stacked ensemble, where each such classifier becomes an expert in\nits own domain but a non-expert to others. Motivated by this, a meta-classifier\nis employed to learn from these experts collaboratively so that when developing\nan ensemble, they can leverage complementary information from each other to\nbetter tackle or be more useful for an unseen target domain. Experimental\nresults using half total error rates (HTERs) on four PAD databases CASIA-MFSD\n(6.97 %), Replay-Attack (33.49%), MSU-MFSD (4.02%), and OULU-NPU (10.91%))\ndemonstrate the robustness of the method and open up new possibilities for\nadvancing presentation attack detection using ensemble learning with\nlarge-scale synthetic data.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a multiphysics and geometric multiscale computational model,\nsuitable to describe the hemodynamics of the whole human heart, driven by a\nfour-chamber electromechanical model. We first present a study on the\ncalibration of the biophysically detailed RDQ20 activation model (Regazzoni et\nal., 2020) that is able to reproduce the physiological range of hemodynamic\nbiomarkers. Then, we demonstrate that the ability of the force generation model\nto reproduce certain microscale mechanisms, such as the dependence of force on\nfiber shortening velocity, is crucial to capture the overall physiological\nmechanical and fluid dynamics macroscale behavior. This motivates the need for\nusing multiscale models with high biophysical fidelity, even when the outputs\nof interest are relative to the macroscale. We show that the use of a\nhigh-fidelity electromechanical model, combined with a detailed calibration\nprocess, allows us to achieve remarkable biophysical fidelity in terms of both\nmechanical and hemodynamic quantities. Indeed, our electromechanical-driven CFD\nsimulations - carried out on an anatomically accurate geometry of the whole\nheart - provide results that match the cardiac physiology both qualitatively\n(in terms of flow patterns) and quantitatively (when comparing in silico\nresults with biomarkers acquired in vivo).

    "abstract": "In data-parallel optimization of machine learning models, workers collaborate\nto improve their estimates of the model: more accurate gradients allow them to\nuse larger learning rates and optimize faster. In the decentralized setting, in\nwhich workers communicate over a sparse graph, current theory fails to capture\nimportant aspects of real-world behavior. First, the `spectral gap' of the\ncommunication graph is not predictive of its empirical performance in (deep)\nlearning. Second, current theory does not explain that collaboration enables\nlarger learning rates than training alone. In fact, it prescribes smaller\nlearning rates, which further decrease as graphs become larger, failing to\nexplain convergence dynamics in infinite graphs. This paper aims to paint an\naccurate picture of sparsely-connected distributed optimization. We quantify\nhow the graph topology influences convergence in a quadratic toy problem and\nprovide theoretical results for general smooth and (strongly) convex\nobjectives. Our theory matches empirical observations in deep learning, and\naccurately describes the relative merits of different graph topologies.

    "abstract": "We introduce multi-head neural networks (MH-NNs) to physics-informed machine\nlearning, which is a type of neural networks (NNs) with all nonlinear hidden\nlayers as the body and multiple linear output layers as multi-head. Hence, we\nconstruct multi-head physics-informed neural networks (MH-PINNs) as a potent\ntool for multi-task learning (MTL), generative modeling, and few-shot learning\nfor diverse problems in scientific machine learning (SciML). MH-PINNs connect\nmultiple functions/tasks via a shared body as the basis functions as well as a\nshared distribution for the head. The former is accomplished by solving\nmultiple tasks with MH-PINNs with each head independently corresponding to each\ntask, while the latter by employing normalizing flows (NFs) for density\nestimate and generative modeling. To this end, our method is a two-stage\nmethod, and both stages can be tackled with standard deep learning tools of\nNNs, enabling easy implementation in practice. MH-PINNs can be used for various\npurposes, such as approximating stochastic processes, solving multiple tasks\nsynergistically, providing informative prior knowledge for downstream few-shot\nlearning tasks such as meta-learning and transfer learning, learning\nrepresentative basis functions, and uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of MH-PINNs in five benchmarks, investigating also the\npossibility of synergistic learning in regression analysis.

We examine how\nusers would prefer for three categories of norm-violating content (hate speech,\nsexually explicit content, and violent content) to be regulated. Specifically,\nwe analyze whether users prefer platforms to remove such content for all users\nor leave it up to each user to decide if and how much they want to moderate it.\nWe explore the influence of presumed effects on others (PME3) and support for\nfreedom of expression on user attitudes, the two critical factors identified as\nrelevant for social media censorship attitudes by prior literature, about this\nchoice. We find perceived negative effects on others and free speech support as\nsignificant predictors of preference for having personal moderation settings\nover platform-directed moderation for regulating each speech category. Our\nfindings show that platform governance initiatives need to account for both the\nactual and perceived media effects of norm-violating speech categories to\nincrease user satisfaction.

For a fixed poset the collection of weakening relations is a subreduct\nof the full relation algebra on the underlying set of the poset. We present a\ntwo-player game for the class of representable weakening relation algebras akin\nto that for the class of representable relation algebras.

    "abstract": "Unlike language tasks, where the output space is usually limited to a set of\ntokens, the output space of visual tasks is more complicated, making it\ndifficult to build a unified visual model for various visual tasks. In this\npaper, we seek to unify the output space of visual tasks, so that we can also\nbuild a unified model for visual tasks. To this end, we demonstrate a single\nunified model that simultaneously handles two typical visual tasks of instance\nsegmentation and depth estimation, which have discrete/fixed-length and\ncontinuous/varied-length outputs, respectively. We propose several new\ntechniques that take into account the particularity of visual tasks: 1) Soft\ntoken. We employ soft token to represent the task output. Unlike hard tokens in\nthe common VQ-VAE which are assigned one-hot to discrete\ncodebooks/vocabularies, the soft token is assigned softly to the codebook\nembeddings. Soft token can improve the accuracy of both the next token\ninference and decoding of the task output; 2) Mask augmentation. Many visual\ntasks have corruption, undefined or invalid values in label annotations, i.e.,\noccluded area of depth maps. We show that a mask augmentation technique can\ngreatly benefit these tasks. With these new techniques and other designs, we\nshow that the proposed general-purpose task-solver can perform both instance\nsegmentation and depth estimation well. Particularly, we achieve 0.279 RMSE on\nthe specific task of NYUv2 depth estimation, setting a new record on this\nbenchmark.

    "abstract": "Quadratic programming over the (special) orthogonal group encompasses a broad\nclass of optimization problems such as group synchronization, point-set\nregistration, and simultaneous localization and mapping. Such problems are\ninstances of the little noncommutative Grothendieck problem (LNCG), a natural\ngeneralization of quadratic combinatorial optimization where, instead of binary\ndecision variables, one optimizes over orthogonal matrices. In this work, we\nestablish an embedding of this class of LNCG problems over the orthogonal group\nonto a quantum Hamiltonian. This embedding is accomplished by identifying\northogonal matrices with their double cover (Pin and Spin group) elements,\nwhich we represent as quantum states. We connect this construction to the\ntheory of free fermions, which provides a physical interpretation of the\nderived LNCG Hamiltonian as a two-body interacting-fermion model due to the\nquadratic nature of the problem. Determining extremal states of this\nHamiltonian provides an outer approximation to the original problem, analogous\nto classical relaxations of the problem via semidefinite programming. When\noptimizing over the special orthogonal group, our quantum relaxation naturally\nobeys additional, powerful constraints based on the convex hull of rotation\nmatrices. The classical size of this convex-hull representation is exponential\nin matrix dimension, whereas the quantum representation requires only a linear\nnumber of qubits. Finally, to project the relaxed solution into the feasible\nspace, we employ rounding procedures which return orthogonal matrices from\nappropriate measurements of the quantum state. Through numerical experiments we\nprovide evidence that this quantum relaxation can produce high-quality\napproximations.",

    "abstract": "Any image is perceived subconsciously as a coherent structure (or whole) with\ntwo contrast substructures: figure and ground. The figure consists of numerous\nauto-generated substructures with an inherent hierarchy of far more smalls than\nlarges. Through these substructures, the structural beauty of an image (L) can\nbe computed by the multiplication of the number of substructures (S) and their\ninherent hierarchy (H). This definition implies that the more substructures,\nthe more living or more structurally beautiful, and the higher hierarchy of the\nsubstructures, the more living or more structurally beautiful. This is the\nnon-recursive approach to the structural beauty of images or the livingness of\nspace. In this paper we develop a recursive approach, which derives all\nsubstructures of an image (instead of its figure) and continues the deriving\nprocess for those decomposable substructures until none of them are\ndecomposable. All of the substructures derived at different iterations (or\nrecursive levels) together constitute a living structure; hence the notion of\nliving images. We applied the recursive approach to a set of images and found\nthat (1) the number of substructures of an image is far lower (3 percent on\naverage) than the number of pixels and the centroids of the substructures can\neffectively capture the skeleton or saliency of the image; (2) all the images\nhave the recursive levels more than three, indicating that they are indeed\nliving images; (3) no more than 2 percent of the substructures are\ndecomposable; (4) structural beauty can be measured by the recursively defined\nsubstructures, as well as their decomposable subsets. The recursive approach is\nproved to be more robust than the non-recursive approach. The recursive\napproach and the non-recursive approach both provide a powerful means to study\nthe livingness or vitality of space in cities and communities.",

While some\nprevious works have investigated the ability of adversarial attacks to degrade\nmodel performance in medical imaging, the ability to falsely improve\nperformance via recently-developed \"enhancement attacks\" may be a greater\nthreat to biomedical machine learning. In the spirit of developing attacks to\nbetter understand trustworthiness, we developed three techniques to drastically\nenhance prediction performance of classifiers with minimal changes to features,\nincluding the enhancement of 1) within-dataset predictions, 2) a particular\nmethod over another, and 3) cross-dataset generalization.

Similarly, the method-specific enhancement framework\nwas effective in falsely improving the performance of one method over another.\nFor example, a simple neural network outperformed LR by 50% on our enhanced\ndataset, although no performance differences were present in the original\ndataset. Crucially, the original and enhanced data were still similar (r=0.95).\nFinally, we demonstrated that enhancement is not specific to within-dataset\npredictions but can also be adapted to enhance the generalization accuracy of\none dataset to another by up to 38%.

    "title": "A Novel Exploitative and Explorative GWO-SVM Algorithm for Smart Emotion  Recognition",
    "abstract": "Emotion recognition or detection is broadly utilized in patient-doctor\ninteractions for diseases such as schizophrenia and autism and the most typical\ntechniques are speech detection and facial recognition. However, features\nextracted from these behavior-based emotion recognitions are not reliable since\nhumans can disguise their emotions. Recording voices or tracking facial\nexpressions for a long term is also not efficient. Therefore, our aim is to\nfind a reliable and efficient emotion recognition scheme, which can be used for\nnon-behavior-based emotion recognition in real-time. This can be solved by\nimplementing a single-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) based emotion recognition\nscheme in a lightweight embedded system. However, existing schemes have\nrelatively low accuracy. Therefore, we propose a reliable and efficient emotion\nrecognition scheme - exploitative and explorative grey wolf optimizer based SVM\n(X - GWO - SVM) for ECG-based emotion recognition. Two datasets, one raw\nself-collected iRealcare dataset, and the widely-used benchmark WESAD dataset\nare used in the X - GWO - SVM algorithm for emotion recognition. This work\ndemonstrates that the X - GWO - SVM algorithm can be used for emotion\nrecognition and the algorithm exhibits superior performance in reliability\ncompared to the use of other supervised machine learning methods in earlier\nworks. It can be implemented in a lightweight embedded system, which is much\nmore efficient than existing solutions based on deep neural networks.",

    "abstract": "The structure and variability of the brain's connections can be investigated\nvia prediction of non-imaging phenotypes using neural networks.

An\nEdgeConv module aggregates features from anatomically similar white matter\nconnections indicated by graph edges, and an attention module enables\ninterpretation of predictive white matter tracts. Results in a sex prediction\ntestbed task demonstrate strong performance of TractGraphCNN in two large\ndatasets (HCP and ABCD). Graphs informed by white matter geometry demonstrate\nhigher performance than graphs informed by gray matter connectivity. Overall,\nthe bilateral cingulum and left middle longitudinal fasciculus are consistently\nhighly predictive of sex.

    "abstract": "This paper aims to tackle the issues on unavailable or insufficient clinical\nUS data and meaningful annotation to enable bone segmentation and registration\nfor US-guided spinal surgery. While the US is not a standard paradigm for\nspinal surgery, the scarcity of intra-operative clinical US data is an\ninsurmountable bottleneck in training a neural network. Moreover, due to the\ncharacteristics of US imaging, it is difficult to clearly annotate bone\nsurfaces which causes the trained neural network missing its attention to the\ndetails. Hence, we propose an In silico bone US simulation framework that\nsynthesizes realistic US images from diagnostic CT volume. Afterward, using\nthese simulated bone US we train a lightweight vision transformer model that\ncan achieve accurate and on-the-fly bone segmentation for spinal sonography. In\nthe validation experiments, the realistic US simulation was conducted by\nderiving from diagnostic spinal CT volume to facilitate a radiation-free\nUS-guided pedicle screw placement procedure. When it is employed for training\nbone segmentation task, the Chamfer distance achieves 0.599mm; when it is\napplied for CT-US registration, the associated bone segmentation accuracy\nachieves 0.93 in Dice, and the registration accuracy based on the segmented\npoint cloud is 0.13~3.37mm in a complication-free manner. While bone US images\nexhibit strong echoes at the medium interface, it may enable the model\nindistinguishable between thin interfaces and bone surfaces by simply relying\non small neighborhood information. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose\nto utilize a Long-range Contrast Learning Module to fully explore the\nLong-range Contrast between the candidates and their surrounding pixels.",

For example, classification, clustering, and data\nvisualization methods all require a quantification of differences in the\nobserved values. We can refer to the quantification of such differences, as\ndistance. An appropriate definition of a distance depends on the nature of the\ndata and the problem at hand. For distances between numerical variables, there\nexist many definitions that depend on the size of the observed differences. For\ncategorical data, the definition of a distance is more complex, as there is no\nstraightforward quantification of the size of the observed differences.\nConsequently, many proposals exist that can be used to measure differences\nbased on categorical variables. In this paper, we introduce a general framework\nthat allows for an efficient and transparent implementation of distances\nbetween observations on categorical variables. We show that several existing\ndistances can be incorporated into the framework. Moreover, our framework quite\nnaturally leads to the introduction of new distance formulations and allows for\nthe implementation of flexible, case and data specific distance definitions.\nFurthermore, in a supervised classification setting, the framework can be used\nto construct distances that incorporate the association between the response\nand predictor variables and hence improve the performance of distance-based\nclassifiers.",

    "title": "Competitive learning to generate sparse representations for associative  memory",
    "abstract": "One of the most well established brain principles, hebbian learning, has led\nto the theoretical concept of neural assemblies. Based on it, many interesting\nbrain theories have spawned. Palm's work implements this concept through binary\nassociative memory, in a model that not only has a wide cognitive explanatory\npower but also makes neuroscientific predictions. Yet, associative memory can\nonly work with logarithmic sparse representations, which makes it extremely\ndifficult to apply the model to real data. We propose a biologically plausible\nnetwork that encodes images into codes that are suitable for associative\nmemory. It is organized into groups of neurons that specialize on local\nreceptive fields, and learn through a competitive scheme. After conducting\nauto- and hetero-association experiments on two visual data sets, we can\nconclude that our network not only beats sparse coding baselines, but also that\nit comes close to the performance achieved using optimal random codes.",

Our\nmethod leverages deep pretrained and sequential neural networks, including\nwav2vec 2.0 and LSTM, and is validated on three data sets from three different\ngreat ape lineages (orangutans, chimpanzees, and bonobos). The recordings were\ncollected by different researchers and include different annotation schemes,\nwhich our pipeline preprocesses and trains in a uniform fashion. Our results\nfor call detection and classification attain high accuracy. Our method is aimed\nto be generalizable to other animal species, and more generally, sound event\ndetection tasks.

    "title": "Value Enhancement of Reinforcement Learning via Efficient and Robust  Trust Region Optimization",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful machine learning technique that\nenables an intelligent agent to learn an optimal policy that maximizes the\ncumulative rewards in sequential decision making. Most of methods in the\nexisting literature are developed in \\textit{online} settings where the data\nare easy to collect or simulate. Motivated by high stake domains such as mobile\nhealth studies with limited and pre-collected data, in this paper, we study\n\\textit{offline} reinforcement learning methods. To efficiently use these\ndatasets for policy optimization, we propose a novel value enhancement method\nto improve the performance of a given initial policy computed by existing\nstate-of-the-art RL algorithms. Specifically, when the initial policy is not\nconsistent, our method will output a policy whose value is no worse and often\nbetter than that of the initial policy. When the initial policy is consistent,\nunder some mild conditions, our method will yield a policy whose value\nconverges to the optimal one at a faster rate than the initial policy,\nachieving the desired ``value enhancement\" property. The proposed method is\ngenerally applicable to any parametrized policy that belongs to certain\npre-specified function class (e.g., deep neural networks). Extensive numerical\nstudies are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of our method.",

    "title": "Optimal lower bounds for Quantum Learning via Information Theory",
    "abstract": "Although a concept class may be learnt more efficiently using quantum samples\nas compared with classical samples in certain scenarios, Arunachalam and de\nWolf (JMLR, 2018) proved that quantum learners are asymptotically no more\nefficient than classical ones in the quantum PAC and Agnostic learning models.\nThey established lower bounds on sample complexity via quantum state\nidentification and Fourier analysis. In this paper, we derive optimal lower\nbounds for quantum sample complexity in both the PAC and agnostic models via an\ninformation-theoretic approach. The proofs are arguably simpler, and the same\nideas can potentially be used to derive optimal bounds for other problems in\nquantum learning theory.\nWe then turn to a quantum analogue of the Coupon Collector problem, a classic\nproblem from probability theory also of importance in the study of PAC\nlearning. Arunachalam, Belovs, Childs, Kothari, Rosmanis, and de Wolf (TQC,\n2020) characterized the quantum sample complexity of this problem up to\nconstant factors. First, we show that the information-theoretic approach\nmentioned above provably does not yield the optimal lower bound. As a\nby-product, we get a natural ensemble of pure states in arbitrarily high\ndimensions which are not easily (simultaneously) distinguishable, while the\nensemble has close to maximal Holevo information. Second, we discover that the\ninformation-theoretic approach yields an asymptotically optimal bound for an\napproximation variant of the problem. Finally, we derive a sharp lower bound\nfor the Quantum Coupon Collector problem, with the exact leading order term,\nvia the Holevo-Curlander bounds on the distinguishability of an ensemble. All\nthe aspects of the Quantum Coupon Collector problem we study rest on properties\nof the spectrum of the associated Gram matrix, which may be of independent\ninterest.",
