    "abstract": "To tackle challenging combinatorial optimization problems, analog computing\nmachines based on the nature-inspired Ising model are attracting increasing\nattentions in order to disruptively overcome the impending limitations on\nconventional electronic computers. Photonic spatial Ising machine has become an\nunique and primitive solution with all-to-all connections to solve large-scale\nMax-cut problems. However, spin configuration and flipping requires two\nindependent sets of spatial light modulators (SLMs) for amplitude and phase\nmodulation, which will lead to tremendous engineering difficulty of optical\nalignment and coupling. We report a novel quadrature photonic spatial-Euler\nIsing machine to realize large-scale and flexible spin-interaction\nconfiguration and spin-flip in a single spatial light modulator, and develop a\nnoise enhancement approach by adding digital white noise onto detected optical\nsignals. We experimentally show that such proposal accelerates solving\n(un)weighted, (non)fully connected, 20736-node Max-cut problems, which offers\nobvious advantages over simulation and heuristic algorithm results in digital\ncomputers.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning is becoming increasingly prevalent for tackling challenges\nin earthquake engineering and providing fairly reliable and accurate\npredictions. However, it is mostly unclear how decisions are made because\nmachine learning models are generally highly sophisticated, resulting in opaque\nblack-box models. Machine learning models that are naturally interpretable and\nprovide their own decision explanation, rather than using an explanatory, are\nmore accurate in determining what the model actually computes. With this\nmotivation, this study aims to develop a fully explainable machine learning\nmodel to predict the deformation capacity of non-ductile reinforced concrete\nshear walls based on experimental data collected worldwide. The proposed\nExplainable Boosting Machines (EBM)-based model is an interpretable, robust,\nnaturally explainable glass-box model, yet provides high accuracy comparable to\nits black-box counterparts. The model enables the user to observe the\nrelationship between the wall properties and the deformation capacity by\nquantifying the individual contribution of each wall property as well as the\ncorrelations among them. The mean coefficient of determination R2 and the mean\nratio of predicted to actual value based on the test dataset are 0.92 and 1.05,\nrespectively. The proposed predictive model stands out with its overall\nconsistency with scientific knowledge, practicality, and interpretability\nwithout sacrificing high accuracy.",

However, its damping and force-velocity properties\nare less well studied. Understanding these properties will allow for more\nrobust dynamic modeling of soft robotic systems. The force-velocity response of\nthese actuators is of particular interest because these actuators are often\nused as hardware models of skeletal muscles for bioinspired robots, and this\nforce-velocity relationship is fundamental to muscle physiology. In this work,\nwe investigated the force-velocity response of McKibben actuators and the\nability to tune this response through the use of viscoelastic polymer sheaths.\nThese viscoelastic McKibben actuators (VMAs) were characterized using\niso-velocity experiments inspired by skeletal muscle physiology tests. A\nsimplified 1D model of the actuators was developed to connect the shape of the\nforce-velocity curve to the material parameters of the actuator and sheaths.\nUsing these viscoelastic materials, we were able to modulate the shape and\nmagnitude of the actuators' force-velocity curves, and using the developed\nmodel, these changes were connected back to the material properties of the\nsheaths.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel solution for unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation. To\ntranslate complex images with a wide range of objects to a different domain,\nrecent approaches often use the object annotations to perform per-class\nsource-to-target style mapping. However, there remains a point for us to\nexploit in the I2I. An object in each class consists of multiple components,\nand all the sub-object components have different characteristics. For example,\na car in CAR class consists of a car body, tires, windows and head and tail\nlamps, etc., and they should be handled separately for realistic I2I\ntranslation. The simplest solution to the problem will be to use more detailed\nannotations with sub-object component annotations than the simple object\nannotations, but it is not possible. The key idea of this paper is to bypass\nthe sub-object component annotations by leveraging the original style of the\ninput image because the original style will include the information about the\ncharacteristics of the sub-object components. Specifically, for each pixel, we\nuse not only the per-class style gap between the source and target domains but\nalso the pixel's original style to determine the target style of a pixel. To\nthis end, we present Style Harmonization for unpaired I2I translation (SHUNIT).\nOur SHUNIT generates a new style by harmonizing the target domain style\nretrieved from a class memory and an original source image style. Instead of\ndirect source-to-target style mapping, we aim for source and target styles\nharmonization. We validate our method with extensive experiments and achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on the latest benchmark sets.

    "abstract": "This article aims to provide a novel formalization of the concept of\ncomputational irreducibility in terms of the exactness of functorial\ncorrespondence between a category of data structures and elementary\ncomputations and a corresponding category of (1-dimensional) cobordisms. We\nproceed to demonstrate that, by equipping both categories with a symmetric\nmonoidal structure and considering the case of higher-dimensional cobordism\ncategories, we obtain a natural extension of this formalism that serves also to\nencompass non-deterministic or ``multiway'' computations, in which one\nquantifies not only the irreducibility in the behavior of a single\n(deterministic) computation path, but in the branching and merging behavior of\nan entire ``multiway system'' of such paths too. We finally outline how, in the\nmost general case, the resulting symmetric monoidal functor may be considered\nto be adjoint to the functor characterizing the Atiyah-Segal axiomatization of\na functorial quantum field theory. Thus, we conclude by arguing that the\nirreducibility of (multi)computations may be thought of as being dual to the\nlocality of time evolution in functorial approaches to quantum mechanics and\nquantum field theory. In the process, we propose an extension of the methods of\nstandard (monoidal) category theory, in which morphisms are effectively\nequipped with intrinsic computational complexity data, together with an algebra\nfor how those complexities compose (both in sequence and in parallel, subject\nto the monoidal structure).",

The pairing between data available to the SP\nand users in the data market requires an effective mechanism design that\nconsiders the SPs' profitability and the quality-of-service (QoS) needs of the\nusers. We develop a generic framework to analyze and enable such interactions\nefficiently, leveraging tools from contract theory and mechanism design theory.\nIt can enable and empower emerging data sharing paradigms such as\nSensing-as-a-Service (SaaS). The contract design creates a pricing structure\nfor on-demand sensing data for IoT users. By considering a continuum of user\ntypes, we capture a diverse range of application requirements and propose\noptimal pricing and allocation rules that ensure QoS provisioning and maximum\nprofitability for the SP. Furthermore, we provide analytical solutions for\nfixed distributions of user types to analyze the developed approach. For\ncomparison, we consider the benchmark case assuming complete information of the\nuser types and obtain optimal contract solutions. Finally, a case study is\npresented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed contract design\nframework.",

    "abstract": "As the most common representation for 3D shapes, mesh is often stored\ndiscretely with arrays of vertices and faces. However, 3D shapes in the real\nworld are presented continuously. In this paper, we propose to learn a\ncontinuous representation for meshes with fixed topology, a common and\npractical setting in many faces-, hand-, and body-related applications. First,\nwe split the template into multiple closed manifold genus-0 meshes so that each\ngenus-0 mesh can be parameterized onto the unit sphere. Then we learn spherical\nimplicit surface (SIS), which takes a spherical coordinate and a global feature\nor a set of local features around the coordinate as inputs, predicting the\nvertex corresponding to the coordinate as an output. Since the spherical\ncoordinates are continuous, SIS can depict a mesh in an arbitrary resolution.\nSIS representation builds a bridge between discrete and continuous\nrepresentation in 3D shapes. Specifically, we train SIS networks in a\nself-supervised manner for two tasks: a reconstruction task and a\nsuper-resolution task. Experiments show that our SIS representation is\ncomparable with state-of-the-art methods that are specifically designed for\nmeshes with a fixed resolution and significantly outperforms methods that work\nin arbitrary resolutions.",

    "abstract": "Semantic labeling of coronary arterial segments in invasive coronary\nangiography (ICA) is important for automated assessment and report generation\nof coronary artery stenosis in the computer-aided diagnosis of coronary artery\ndisease (CAD). Inspired by the training procedure of interventional\ncardiologists for interpreting the structure of coronary arteries, we propose\nan association graph-based graph matching network (AGMN) for coronary arterial\nsemantic labeling. We first extract the vascular tree from invasive coronary\nangiography (ICA) and convert it into multiple individual graphs. Then, an\nassociation graph is constructed from two individual graphs where each vertex\nrepresents the relationship between two arterial segments. Using the\nassociation graph, the AGMN extracts the vertex features by the embedding\nmodule, aggregates the features from adjacent vertices and edges by graph\nconvolution network, and decodes the features to generate the semantic mappings\nbetween arteries. By learning the mapping of arterial branches between two\nindividual graphs, the unlabeled arterial segments are classified by the\nlabeled segments to achieve semantic labeling. A dataset containing 263 ICAs\nwas employed to train and validate the proposed model, and a five-fold\ncross-validation scheme was performed. Our AGMN model achieved an average\naccuracy of 0.8264, an average precision of 0.8276, an average recall of\n0.8264, and an average F1-score of 0.8262, which significantly outperformed\nexisting coronary artery semantic labeling methods. In conclusion, we have\ndeveloped and validated a new algorithm with high accuracy, interpretability,\nand robustness for coronary artery semantic labeling on ICAs.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, the use of machine learning models has emerged as a\ngeneric and powerful means for prediction purposes. At the same time, there is\na growing demand for interpretability of prediction models. To determine which\nfeatures of a dataset are important to predict a target variable $Y$, a Feature\nImportance (FI) method can be used. By quantifying how important each feature\nis for predicting $Y$, irrelevant features can be identified and removed, which\ncould increase the speed and accuracy of a model, and moreover, important\nfeatures can be discovered, which could lead to valuable insights. A major\nproblem with evaluating FI methods, is that the ground truth FI is often\nunknown. As a consequence, existing FI methods do not give the exact correct FI\nvalues. This is one of the many reasons why it can be hard to properly\ninterpret the results of an FI method. Motivated by this, we introduce a new\nglobal approach named the Berkelmans-Pries FI method, which is based on a\ncombination of Shapley values and the Berkelmans-Pries dependency function. We\nprove that our method has many useful properties, and accurately predicts the\ncorrect FI values for several cases where the ground truth FI can be derived in\nan exact manner. We experimentally show for a large collection of FI methods\n(468) that existing methods do not have the same useful properties. This shows\nthat the Berkelmans-Pries FI method is a highly valuable tool for analyzing\ndatasets with complex interdependencies.",

In\nthis paper, we study the benefits and challenges of using a learned dynamics\nmodel when performing PbRL. In particular, we provide evidence that a learned\ndynamics model offers the following benefits when performing PbRL: (1)\npreference elicitation and policy optimization require significantly fewer\nenvironment interactions than model-free PbRL, (2) diverse preference queries\ncan be synthesized safely and efficiently as a byproduct of standard\nmodel-based RL, and (3) reward pre-training based on suboptimal demonstrations\ncan be performed without any environmental interaction.

All state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in this challenge\ncontained hundreds of millions of parameters.

It is not easy to propose a new model with a novel\narchitecture and intensively train it on a massive dataset with many GPUs to\nsurpass many SOTA models, which are already available to use on the Internet.\nIn this paper, we proposed a compact graph-based framework, named HADA, which\ncan combine pretrained models to produce a better result, rather than building\nfrom scratch. First, we created a graph structure in which the nodes were the\nfeatures extracted from the pretrained models and the edges connecting them.\nThe graph structure was employed to capture and fuse the information from every\npretrained model with each other. Then a graph neural network was applied to\nupdate the connection between the nodes to get the representative embedding\nvector for an image and text. Finally, we used the cosine similarity to match\nimages with their relevant texts and vice versa to ensure a low inference time.\nOur experiments showed that, although HADA contained a tiny number of trainable\nparameters, it could increase baseline performance by more than 3.6% in terms\nof evaluation metrics in the Flickr30k dataset. Additionally, the proposed\nmodel did not train on any external dataset and did not require many GPUs but\nonly 1 to train due to its small number of parameters.

To this end, this work\noffers an approach to characterize and visualize the interior of a rubble pile\nand conduct a preliminary analysis of the occurrence of voids. Specifically,\nthe analysis makes opportunistic use of four days of aerial imagery gathered\nfrom responders at Surfside to create a 3D volumetric aggregated model of the\ncollapse in order to identify and characterize void spaces in the interior of\nthe rubble. The preliminary results confirm expectations of small number and\nscale of these interior voids.

    "abstract": "Residential heating, primarily powered by natural gas, accounts for a\nsignificant portion of residential sector energy use and carbon emissions in\nmany parts of the world. Hence, there is a push towards decarbonizing\nresidential heating by transitioning to energy-efficient heat pumps powered by\nan increasingly greener and less carbon-intensive electric grid. However, such\na transition will add additional load to the electric grid triggering\ninfrastructure upgrades, and subsequently erode the customer base using the gas\ndistribution network. Utilities want to guide these transition efforts to\nensure a phased decommissioning of the gas network and deferred electric grid\ninfrastructure upgrades while achieving carbon reduction goals. To facilitate\nsuch a transition, we present a network-aware optimization framework for\ndecarbonizing residential heating at city scale with an objective to maximize\ncarbon reduction under budgetary constraints. Our approach operates on a graph\nrepresentation of the gas network topology to compute the cost of transitioning\nand select neighborhoods for transition. We further extend our approach to\nexplicitly incorporate equity and ensure an equitable distribution of benefits\nacross different socioeconomic groups. We apply our framework to a city in the\nNew England region of the U.S., using real-world gas usage, electric usage, and\ngrid infrastructure data.

    "abstract": "Accurate tracking of an anatomical landmark over time has been of high\ninterests for disease assessment such as minimally invasive surgery and tumor\nradiation therapy. Ultrasound imaging is a promising modality benefiting from\nlow-cost and real-time acquisition. However, generating a precise landmark\ntracklet is very challenging, as attempts can be easily distorted by different\ninterference such as landmark deformation, visual ambiguity and partial\nobservation. In this paper, we propose a long-short diffeomorphic motion\nnetwork, which is a multi-task framework with a learnable deformation prior to\nsearch for the plausible deformation of landmark. Specifically, we design a\nnovel diffeomorphism representation in both long and short temporal domains for\ndelineating motion margins and reducing long-term cumulative tracking errors.\nTo further mitigate local anatomical ambiguity, we propose an expectation\nmaximisation motion alignment module to iteratively optimize both long and\nshort deformation, aligning to the same directional and spatial representation.\nThe proposed multi-task system can be trained in a weakly-supervised manner,\nwhich only requires few landmark annotations for tracking and zero annotation\nfor long-short deformation learning. We conduct extensive experiments on two\nultrasound landmark tracking datasets. Experimental results show that our\nproposed method can achieve better or competitive landmark tracking performance\ncompared with other state-of-the-art tracking methods, with a strong\ngeneralization capability across different scanner types and different\nultrasound modalities.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale language model pretraining is a very successful form of\nself-supervised learning in natural language processing, but it is increasingly\nexpensive to perform as the models and pretraining corpora have become larger\nover time. We propose NarrowBERT, a modified transformer encoder that increases\nthe throughput for masked language model pretraining by more than $2\\times$.\nNarrowBERT sparsifies the transformer model such that the self-attention\nqueries and feedforward layers only operate on the masked tokens of each\nsentence during pretraining, rather than all of the tokens as with the usual\ntransformer encoder. We also show that NarrowBERT increases the throughput at\ninference time by as much as $3.5\\times$ with minimal (or no) performance\ndegradation on sentence encoding tasks like MNLI. Finally, we examine the\nperformance of NarrowBERT on the IMDB and Amazon reviews classification and\nCoNLL NER tasks and show that it is also comparable to standard BERT\nperformance.",

Of the challenges we\nidentify, communication problems, such as unresponsiveness and disputes, are\nthe most substantial.

However, understanding how to\napply the world modeling approach in complex real-world environments relevant\nto mobile robots remains an open question. In this paper, we present a\nframework for learning a probabilistic predictive world model for real-world\nroad environments. We implement the model using a hierarchical VAE (HVAE)\ncapable of predicting a diverse set of fully observed plausible worlds from\naccumulated sensor observations. While prior HVAE methods require complete\nstates as ground truth for learning, we present a novel sequential training\nmethod to allow HVAEs to learn to predict complete states from partially\nobserved states only. We experimentally demonstrate accurate spatial structure\nprediction of deterministic regions achieving 96.21 IoU, and close the gap to\nperfect prediction by 62 % for stochastic regions using the best prediction. By\nextending HVAEs to cases where complete ground truth states do not exist, we\nfacilitate continual learning of spatial prediction as a step towards realizing\nexplainable and comprehensive predictive world models for real-world mobile\nrobotics applications.",

To achieve\nstronger robustness, existing methods primarily focus on how to generate strong\nattacks by increasing the number of update steps, regularizing the models with\nthe smoothed loss function, and injecting the randomness into the attack.\nInstead, we analyze the behavior of adversarial training through the lens of\nresponse frequency. We empirically discover that adversarial training causes\nneural networks to have low convergence to high-frequency information,\nresulting in highly oscillated predictions near each data. To learn\nhigh-frequency contents efficiently and effectively, we first prove that a\nuniversal phenomenon of frequency principle, i.e., \\textit{lower frequencies\nare learned first}, still holds in adversarial training. Based on that, we\npropose phase-shifted adversarial training (PhaseAT) in which the model learns\nhigh-frequency components by shifting these frequencies to the low-frequency\nrange where the fast convergence occurs. For evaluations, we conduct the\nexperiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with the adaptive attack carefully\ndesigned for reliable evaluation. Comprehensive results show that PhaseAT\nsignificantly improves the convergence for high-frequency information.

However, it has always been very challenging\ndue to the diverse shape and size of polyp. In recent years, state-of-the-art\nmethods have achieved significant breakthroughs in this task with the help of\ndeep convolutional neural networks. However, few algorithms explicitly consider\nthe impact of the size and shape of the polyp and the complex spatial context\non the segmentation performance, which results in the algorithms still being\npowerless for complex samples. In fact, segmentation of polyps of different\nsizes relies on different local and global contextual information for regional\ncontrast reasoning. To tackle these issues, we propose an adaptive context\nselection based encoder-decoder framework which is composed of Local Context\nAttention (LCA) module, Global Context Module (GCM) and Adaptive Selection\nModule (ASM). Specifically, LCA modules deliver local context features from\nencoder layers to decoder layers, enhancing the attention to the hard region\nwhich is determined by the prediction map of previous layer. GCM aims to\nfurther explore the global context features and send to the decoder layers. ASM\nis used for adaptive selection and aggregation of context features through\nchannel-wise attention.

    "title": "Diffusion-based Data Augmentation for Skin Disease Classification:  Impact Across Original Medical Datasets to Fully Synthetic Images",
    "abstract": "Despite continued advancement in recent years, deep neural networks still\nrely on large amounts of training data to avoid overfitting. However, labeled\ntraining data for real-world applications such as healthcare is limited and\ndifficult to access given longstanding privacy, and strict data sharing\npolicies. By manipulating image datasets in the pixel or feature space,\nexisting data augmentation techniques represent one of the effective ways to\nimprove the quantity and diversity of training data. Here, we look to advance\naugmentation techniques by building upon the emerging success of text-to-image\ndiffusion probabilistic models in augmenting the training samples of our\nmacroscopic skin disease dataset. We do so by enabling fine-grained control of\nthe image generation process via input text prompts. We demonstrate that this\ngenerative data augmentation approach successfully maintains a similar\nclassification accuracy of the visual classifier even when trained on a fully\nsynthetic skin disease dataset. Similar to recent applications of generative\nmodels, our study suggests that diffusion models are indeed effective in\ngenerating high-quality skin images that do not sacrifice the classifier\nperformance, and can improve the augmentation of training datasets after\ncuration.",

    "abstract": "Single image dehazing is a challenging ill-posed problem which estimates\nlatent haze-free images from observed hazy images. Some existing deep learning\nbased methods are devoted to improving the model performance via increasing the\ndepth or width of convolution. The learning ability of convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) structure is still under-explored. In this paper, a\ndetail-enhanced attention block (DEAB) consisting of the detail-enhanced\nconvolution (DEConv) and the content-guided attention (CGA) is proposed to\nboost the feature learning for improving the dehazing performance.\nSpecifically, the DEConv integrates prior information into normal convolution\nlayer to enhance the representation and generalization capacity. Then by using\nthe re-parameterization technique, DEConv is equivalently converted into a\nvanilla convolution with NO extra parameters and computational cost. By\nassigning unique spatial importance map (SIM) to every channel, CGA can attend\nmore useful information encoded in features. In addition, a CGA-based mixup\nfusion scheme is presented to effectively fuse the features and aid the\ngradient flow. By combining above mentioned components, we propose our\ndetail-enhanced attention network (DEA-Net) for recovering high-quality\nhaze-free images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our DEA-Net, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by boosting\nthe PSNR index over 41 dB with only 3.653 M parameters.

During an excavation, failure of\nretaining walls could cause catastrophic accidents and hence their lateral\ndeformations are monitored regularly. Laser scanning can rapidly acquire the\nspatial data of a relatively large area at fine spatial resolutions, which is\nideal for monitoring retaining walls' deformations. This paper attempts to\napply laser scanning to measurements of the lateral deformations of a soil\nmixing retaining wall at an ongoing excavation site. Reference measurements by\ntotal station and inclinometer were also conducted to verify those from the\nlaser scanning. The deformations derived using laser scanning data were\nconsistent with the reference measurements at the top part of the retaining\nwall (i.e., mainly the ring beam of the wall).

    "abstract": "We propose a new model that resembles Algorand's mechanism that selects a\ncommittee at each synchronous round to govern the stateless progression of its\nconsensus algorithm. We consider an infinite set of authenticated processors in\na synchronous round-by-round model. At each round $r$ an adversary chooses an\nunknown, finite committee $C_r$. Unlike Algorand, no information is known about\nthe size of the committee. The committee can send messages to the whole\nuniverse, while processors outside the committee at the round do not send\nmessages at all. Moreover, the adversary partitions the committee into a set of\ngood processors $G_r$ and a set of processors $F_r$ that it impersonates during\nround $r$. If we fix $F_r$ to be static, i.e. the same in all rounds, we obtain\nan idealized version of the Sleepy Model of Pass and Shi. If both $G_r$ and\n$F_r$ are static and are additionally known to the processors, we obtain the\ntraditional, synchronous Authenticated Byzantine Agreement Model.\nAssuming that a majority of the committee is good in each round, we show that\nconsensus is solvable deterministically if the union of all sets $F_r$ is\nbounded. We also show that consensus is solvable probabilistically even if both\n$G_r$ and $F_r$ change without bounds. Those are surprising and mathematically\npleasing results because, contrary to the traditional, eventually-synchronous\nmodel, there is no resiliency gap between the static and non-static cases (in\nthe traditional model, resiliency degrades from half under synchrony to one\nthird under eventual synchrony). Moreover, these results are new even for the\nspecial case of the Sleepy Model.",

Specifically,\nwe utilize control barrier functions (CBFs) to impart collision-free behavior\nwith formal safety guarantees to the closed-loop system. The safety of both the\nCAV and HDVs is incorporated into the framework through a quadratic\nprogram-based controller, that minimizes deviation from a nominal stabilizing\ntraffic controller subject to CBF-based safety constraints. Considering that\nsome state information of the following HDVs may be unavailable to the CAV, we\nemploy state observer-based CBFs for STC.

    "abstract": "Time series classification is an important data mining task that has received\na lot of interest in the past two decades. Due to the label scarcity in\npractice, semi-supervised time series classification with only a few labeled\nsamples has become popular. Recently, Similarity-aware Time Series\nClassification (SimTSC) is proposed to address this problem by using a graph\nneural network classification model on the graph generated from pairwise\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance of batch data. It shows excellent accuracy\nand outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in several few-label\nsettings. However, since SimTSC relies on pairwise DTW distances, the quadratic\ncomplexity of DTW limits its usability to only reasonably sized datasets. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a new efficient semi-supervised time series\nclassification technique, LB-SimTSC, with a new graph construction module.\nInstead of using DTW, we propose to utilize a lower bound of DTW, LB_Keogh, to\napproximate the dissimilarity between instances in linear time, while retaining\nthe relative proximity relationships one would have obtained via computing DTW.\nWe construct the pairwise distance matrix using LB_Keogh and build a graph for\nthe graph neural network. We apply this approach to the ten largest datasets\nfrom the well-known UCR time series classification archive. The results\ndemonstrate that this approach can be up to 104x faster than SimTSC when\nconstructing the graph on large datasets without significantly decreasing\nclassification accuracy.",

Further, modeling frameworks are discussed where one modality is\ntransformed into the other, as well as models in which one modality is utilized\nto enhance representation learning for the other. To conclude the second part,\narchitectures with a focus on handling both modalities simultaneously are\nintroduced. Finally, we also cover other modalities as well as general-purpose\nmulti-modal models, which are able to handle different tasks on different\nmodalities within one unified architecture.

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of output quantiles is crucial in many use cases, where\nit is desired to model the range of possibility. Modeling target distribution\nat arbitrary quantile levels and at arbitrary input attribute levels are\nimportant to offer a comprehensive picture of the data, and requires the\nquantile function to be expressive enough. The quantile function describing the\ntarget distribution using quantile levels is critical for quantile regression.\nAlthough various parametric forms for the distributions (that the quantile\nfunction specifies) can be adopted, an everlasting problem is selecting the\nmost appropriate one that can properly approximate the data distributions. In\nthis paper, we propose a non-parametric and data-driven approach, Neural Spline\nSearch (NSS), to represent the observed data distribution without parametric\nassumptions. NSS is flexible and expressive for modeling data distributions by\ntransforming the inputs with a series of monotonic spline regressions guided by\nsymbolic operators. We demonstrate that NSS outperforms previous methods on\nsynthetic, real-world regression and time-series forecasting tasks.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical image segmentation plays a significant role in computer-aided\ndiagnosis. However, existing CNN based methods rely heavily on massive manual\nannotations, which are very expensive and require huge human resources. In this\nwork, we adopt a coarse-to-fine strategy and propose a self-supervised\ncorrection learning paradigm for semi-supervised biomedical image segmentation.\nSpecifically, we design a dual-task network, including a shared encoder and two\nindependent decoders for segmentation and lesion region inpainting,\nrespectively. In the first phase, only the segmentation branch is used to\nobtain a relatively rough segmentation result. In the second step, we mask the\ndetected lesion regions on the original image based on the initial segmentation\nmap, and send it together with the original image into the network again to\nsimultaneously perform inpainting and segmentation separately. For labeled\ndata, this process is supervised by the segmentation annotations, and for\nunlabeled data, it is guided by the inpainting loss of masked lesion regions.\nSince the two tasks rely on similar feature information, the unlabeled data\neffectively enhances the representation of the network to the lesion regions\nand further improves the segmentation performance. Moreover, a gated feature\nfusion (GFF) module is designed to incorporate the complementary features from\nthe two tasks. Experiments on three medical image segmentation datasets for\ndifferent tasks including polyp, skin lesion and fundus optic disc segmentation\nwell demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method compared with other\nsemi-supervised approaches.

    "abstract": "Since the fully convolutional network has achieved great success in semantic\nsegmentation, lots of works have been proposed focusing on extracting\ndiscriminative pixel feature representations. However, we observe that existing\nmethods still suffer from two typical challenges, i.e. (i) large intra-class\nfeature variation in different scenes, (ii) small inter-class feature\ndistinction in the same scene. In this paper, we first rethink semantic\nsegmentation from a perspective of similarity between pixels and class centers.\nEach weight vector of the segmentation head represents its corresponding\nsemantic class in the whole dataset, which can be regarded as the embedding of\nthe class center. Thus, the pixel-wise classification amounts to computing\nsimilarity in the final feature space between pixels and the class centers.\nUnder this novel view, we propose a Class Center Similarity layer (CCS layer)\nto address the above-mentioned challenges by generating adaptive class centers\nconditioned on different scenes and supervising the similarities between class\ncenters. It utilizes a Adaptive Class Center Module (ACCM) to generate class\ncenters conditioned on each scene, which adapt the large intra-class variation\nbetween different scenes. Specially designed loss functions are introduced to\ncontrol both inter-class and intra-class distances based on predicted\ncenter-to-center and pixel-to-center similarity, respectively. Finally, the CCS\nlayer outputs the processed pixel-to-center similarity as the segmentation\nprediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model performs\nfavourably against the state-of-the-art CNN-based methods.",

Existing works have improved the performance of dialogue systems by\nintentionally learning interlocutor personas with sophisticated network\nstructures. One issue with this approach is that it requires more personal\ncorpora with annotations. Additionally, these models typically perform the next\nutterance prediction to generate a response but neglect the discourse coherence\nin the entire conversation. To address these issues, this study proposes a\nmethod of learning to memorize entailment and discourse relations for\npersona-consistent dialogue tasks. Entailment text pairs in natural language\ninference dataset were applied to learn latent entailment relations as external\nmemories by premise-to-hypothesis generation task. Furthermore, an internal\nmemory with a similar architecture was applied to the discourse information in\nthe dialogue. Placing orthogonality restrictions on these two memory spaces\nensures that the latent entailment relations remain dialogue-independent. Both\nmemories collaborate to obtain entailment and discourse representation for the\ngeneration, allowing a deeper understanding of both consistency and coherence.\nExperiments on two large public datasets, PersonaChat and DSTC7-AVSD,\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. Both automatic and human\nevaluations indicate that the proposed model outperforms several strong\nbaselines in terms of both persona consistency and response coherence.

This\nstrategy tends to generate safe responses due to the mutual restriction between\nemotion and semantics, and requires rare emotion-annotated large-scale dialogue\ncorpus. Inspired by the \"think twice\" behavior in human dialogue, we propose a\ntwo-stage conversational agent for the generation of emotional dialogue.\nFirstly, a dialogue model trained without the emotion-annotated dialogue corpus\ngenerates a prototype response that meets the contextual semantics. Secondly,\nthe first-stage prototype is modified by a controllable emotion refiner with\nthe empathy hypothesis.

    "abstract": "The Byzantine consensus problem involves $n$ processes, out of which t < n\ncould be faulty and behave arbitrarily. Three properties characterize\nconsensus: (1) termination, requiring correct (non-faulty) processes to\neventually reach a decision, (2) agreement, preventing them from deciding\ndifferent values, and (3) validity, precluding ``unreasonable'' decisions. But,\nwhat is a reasonable decision? Strong validity, a classical property,\nstipulates that, if all correct processes propose the same value, only that\nvalue can be decided. Weak validity, another established property, stipulates\nthat, if all processes are correct and they propose the same value, that value\nmust be decided. The space of possible validity properties is vast. However,\ntheir impact on consensus remains unclear.\nThis paper addresses the question of which validity properties allow\nByzantine consensus to be solvable with partial synchrony, and at what cost.\nFirst, we determine necessary and sufficient conditions for a validity property\nto make the consensus problem solvable; we say that such validity properties\nare solvable. Notably, we prove that, if n <= 3t, all solvable validity\nproperties are trivial (there exists an always-admissible decision).\nFurthermore, we show that, with any non-trivial (and solvable) validity\nproperty, consensus requires Omega(t^2) messages. This extends the seminal\nDolev-Reischuk bound, originally proven for strong validity, to all non-trivial\nvalidity properties. Lastly, we give a general Byzantine consensus algorithm,\nwe call Universal, for any solvable (and non-trivial) validity property.\nImportantly, Universal incurs O(n^2) message complexity. Thus, together with\nour lower bound, Universal implies a fundamental result in partial synchrony:\nwith t \\in Omega(n), the message complexity of all (non-trivial) consensus\nvariants is Theta(n^2).",

In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate how CLIP\nknowledge benefits 3D scene understanding. To this end, we propose CLIP2Scene,\na simple yet effective framework that transfers CLIP knowledge from 2D\nimage-text pre-trained models to a 3D point cloud network.

Specifically, built upon CLIP, we design a Semantic-driven\nCross-modal Contrastive Learning framework that pre-trains a 3D network via\nsemantic and spatial-temporal consistency regularization. For semantic\nconsistency regularization, we first leverage CLIP's text semantics to select\nthe positive and negative point samples and then employ the contrastive loss to\ntrain the 3D network. In terms of spatial-temporal consistency regularization,\nwe force the consistency between the temporally coherent point cloud features\nand their corresponding image features.

In this work we\npropose a variant of the dispersion problem where we start with any number of\nrobots, and put an additional constraint that no two adjacent nodes contain\nrobots in the final configuration. We name this problem as\nDistance-2-Dispersion (D-2-D). However, even if the number of robots $k$ is\nless than $n$, it may not possible for each robot to find a distinct node to\nreside, maintaining our added constraint. Specifically, if a maximal\nindependent set is already formed by the nodes which contain a robot each, then\nother robots, if any, who are searching for a node to seat, will not find one.\nHence we allow multiple robots to seat on some nodes only if there is no place\nto seat.

SPI is an offline reinforcement learning (RL)\nproblem that assumes access to (1) historical data about an environment, and\n(2) the so-called behavior policy that previously generated this data by\ninteracting with the environment. SPI methods neither require access to a model\nnor the environment itself, and aim to reliably improve the behavior policy in\nan offline manner. Existing methods make the strong assumption that the\nenvironment is fully observable. In our novel approach to the SPI problem for\nPOMDPs, we assume that a finite-state controller (FSC) represents the behavior\npolicy and that finite memory is sufficient to derive optimal policies. This\nassumption allows us to map the POMDP to a finite-state fully observable MDP,\nthe history MDP. We estimate this MDP by combining the historical data and the\nmemory of the FSC, and compute an improved policy using an off-the-shelf SPI\nalgorithm. The underlying SPI method constrains the policy-space according to\nthe available data, such that the newly computed policy only differs from the\nbehavior policy when sufficient data was available. We show that this new\npolicy, converted into a new FSC for the (unknown) POMDP, outperforms the\nbehavior policy with high probability.

These DM modules are used to find and fuse the regions of interest\nin the remaining neural network classification decisions in the mask image in a\nlearning-based way. Since HDM forces DM to perform importance analysis in\ndifferent areas, it makes the fused saliency map more comprehensive.

It is available at\nhttps://somo.chem.utk.edu/shape2sas. The user defines a model of arbitrary\nshape by combining geometrical subunits, and Shape2SAS then calculates and\ndisplays the scattering intensity, the pair distance distribution as well as a\nvisualization of the user-defined shape. Simulated data with realistic noise\nare also generated. We demonstrate how Shape2SAS can calculate and display the\ndifferent scattering patterns for various geometrical shapes, such as spheres\nand cylinders. We also demonstrate how the effect of structure factors can be\nvisualized. Finally, we show how multi-contrast particles can readily be\ngenerated, and how the calculated scattering may be used to validate and\nvisualize analytical models generated in analysis software for fitting\nsmall-angle scattering data.",

As in real life predicting a mean function is most of the time\nnot sufficient, but the question remains how confident can we be about our\nprediction? Thus, in this work, we will introduce a novel graph neural network\narchitecture (WGP-NN) employing (weighted) Gaussian processes (GP) to jointly\nmodel the temporal evolution of the occurrence probability of events and their\ntime-dependent uncertainty. Especially we employ Gaussian processes to model\nthe uncertainty of future links by their ability to predict predictive\nvariance. This is in contrast to existing works, which are only able to express\nuncertainties in the learned entity representations. Moreover, WGP-NN can model\nparameter-free complex temporal and structural dynamics of tKGs in continuous\ntime. We further demonstrate the model's state-of-the-art performance on two\nreal-world benchmark datasets.",

The RIS has the potential for significantly improving the\nperformance of wireless networks. Unfortunately, RIS also multiplies the number\nof Channel State Information (CSI) coefficients between the transmitter and\nreceiver, which magnifies the challenges in estimating and communicating the\nchannel state information. Furthermore, the simplicity and cost-effectiveness\nof the passive RIS also implies that the incoming links are not locally\nestimated at the RIS, and fresh pilots are not inserted into outgoing RIS\nlinks. This introduces new challenges for training and estimation of channel\nstate information. The rapid growth of the literature on CSI acquisition in\nRIS-aided systems has been accompanied by variations in the underlying\nassumptions, models, and notation, which can obscure the similarities and\ndifferences of various techniques, and their relative merits.

Such context, if taken into account while\nlearning, can potentially improve the performance of predictive models.\nTypically, the data from various sensors are present in the form of time\nseries.

However, annotators are individuals with different backgrounds, and\nminors' opinions should not be simply ignored. As annotation tasks become\nsubjective and topics are controversial in modern NLP tasks, we need NLP\nsystems that can represent people's diverse voices on subjective matters and\npredict the level of diversity. This paper examines whether the text of the\ntask and annotators' demographic background information can be used to estimate\nthe level of disagreement among annotators. Particularly, we extract\ndisagreement labels from the annotators' voting histories in the five\nsubjective datasets, and then fine-tune language models to predict annotators'\ndisagreement. Our results show that knowing annotators' demographic\ninformation, like gender, ethnicity, and education level, helps predict\ndisagreements. In order to distinguish the disagreement from the inherent\ncontroversy from text content and the disagreement in the annotators' different\nperspectives, we simulate everyone's voices with different combinations of\nannotators' artificial demographics and examine its variance of the finetuned\ndisagreement predictor.

To correct this behavior, we replace the metric used in the\npersistence score, the Kullback-Leibler divergence, with the Wasserstein\ndistance.

    "abstract": "The importance of tasks in information retrieval (IR) has been long argued\nfor, addressed in different ways, often ignored, and frequently revisited. For\ndecades, scholars made a case for the role that a user's task plays in how and\nwhy that user engages in search and what a search system should do to assist.\nBut for the most part, the IR community has been too focused on query\nprocessing and assuming a search task to be a collection of user queries, often\nignoring if or how such an assumption addresses the users accomplishing their\ntasks. With emerging areas of conversational agents and proactive IR,\nunderstanding and addressing users' tasks has become more important than ever\nbefore. In this paper, we provide various perspectives on where the\nstate-of-the-art is with regard to tasks in IR, what are some of the\nbottlenecks in deriving and using task information, and how do we go forward\nfrom here. In addition to covering relevant literature, the paper provides a\nsynthesis of historical and current perspectives on understanding, extracting,\nand addressing task-focused search. To ground ongoing and future research in\nthis area, we present a new framing device for tasks using a tree-like\nstructure and various moves on that structure that allow different\ninterpretations and applications. Presented as a combination of synthesis of\nideas and past works, proposals for future research, and our perspectives on\ntechnical, social, and ethical considerations, this paper is meant to help\nrevitalize the interest and future work in task-based IR.",

    "title": "Open SESAME: Fighting Botnets with Seed Reconstructions of Domain  Generation Algorithms",
    "abstract": "An important aspect of many botnets is their capability to generate\npseudorandom domain names using Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). A cyber\ncriminal can register such domains to establish periodically changing\nrendezvous points with the bots. DGAs make use of seeds to generate sets of\ndomains. Seeds can easily be changed in order to generate entirely new groups\nof domains while using the same underlying algorithm. While this requires very\nlittle manual effort for an adversary, security specialists typically have to\nmanually reverse engineer new malware strains to reconstruct the seeds. Only\nwhen the seed and DGA are known, past and future domains can be generated,\nefficiently attributed, blocked, sinkholed or used for a take-down. Common\ncounters in the literature consist of databases or Machine Learning (ML) based\ndetectors to keep track of past and future domains of known DGAs and to\nidentify DGA-generated domain names, respectively. However, database based\napproaches can not detect domains generated by new DGAs, and ML approaches can\nnot generate future domain names. In this paper, we introduce SESAME, a system\nthat combines the two above-mentioned approaches and contains a module for\nautomatic Seed Reconstruction, which is, to our knowledge, the first of its\nkind. It is used to automatically classify domain names, rate their novelty,\nand determine the seeds of the underlying DGAs. SESAME consists of multiple\nDGA-specific Seed Reconstructors and is designed to work purely based on domain\nnames, as they are easily obtainable from observing the network traffic. We\nevaluated our approach on 20.8 gigabytes of DNS-lookups. Thereby, we identified\n17 DGAs, of which 4 were entirely new to us.",

    "abstract": "We study a simple random process that computes a maximal independent set\n(MIS) on a general $n$-vertex graph. Each vertex has a binary state, black or\nwhite, where black indicates inclusion into the MIS. The vertex states are\narbitrary initially, and are updated in parallel: In each round, every vertex\nwhose state is ``inconsistent'' with its neighbors', i.e., it is black and has\na black neighbor, or it is white and all neighbors are white, changes its state\nwith probability $1/2$. The process stabilizes with probability 1 on any graph,\nand the resulting set of black vertices is an MIS. It is also easy to see that\nthe expected stabilization time is $O(\\log n)$ on certain graph families, such\nas cliques and trees. However, analyzing the process on graphs beyond these\nsimple cases seems challenging.\nOur main result is that the process stabilizes in $\\mathrm{poly}(\\log n)$\nrounds w.h.p.\\ on $G_{n,p}$ random graphs, for $0\\leq p \\leq \\mathrm{poly}(\\log\nn)\\cdot n^{-1/2}$ and $p \\geq 1/\\mathrm{poly}(\\log n)$. Further, an extension\nof this process, with larger but still constant vertex state space, stabilizes\nin $\\mathrm{poly}(\\log n)$ rounds on $G_{n,p}$ w.h.p., for all $1\\leq p\\leq 1$.\nWe conjecture that this improved bound holds for the original process as well.\nIn fact, we believe that the original process stabilizes in $\\mathrm{poly}(\\log\nn)$ rounds on any given $n$-vertex graph w.h.p. Both processes readily\ntranslate into distributed/parallel MIS algorithms, which are self-stabilizing,\nuse constant space (and constant random bits per round), and assume restricted\ncommunication as in the beeping or the synchronous stone age models. To the\nbest of our knowledge, no previously known MIS algorithm is self-stabilizing,\nuses constant space and constant randomness, and stabilizes in\n$\\mathrm{poly}(\\log n)$ rounds in general or random graphs.",

The training method includes\ntwo new techniques for learning X-FM from text, image, and image-text pair\ndata.

Via examples\nof constraints, we illustrate the utility of our method in providing explicit\nvalues or efficient algorithms for our counting problem. Our second approach is\nto obtain good upper bounds on the sizes of the largest constrained codes that\ncan correct a fixed number of combinatorial errors or erasures. We accomplish\nthis using an extension of Delsarte's linear program (LP) to the setting of\nconstrained systems. We observe that the numerical values of our LP-based upper\nbounds beat those obtained by using the generalized sphere packing bounds of\nFazeli, Vardy, and Yaakobi (2015).",

In practice,\nfully trained neural networks interact randomly with out-of-distribution (OOD)\ninputs and map aberrant samples randomly within the model representation space.\nSince data representations are direct manifestations of the training\ndistribution, the data selection process plays a crucial role in outlier\nrobustness. For paradigms such as active learning, this is especially\nchallenging since protocols must not only improve performance on the training\ndistribution most effectively but further render a robust representation space.\nHowever, existing strategies directly base the data selection on the data\nrepresentation of the unlabeled data which is random for OOD samples by\ndefinition. For this purpose, we introduce forgetful active learning with\nswitch events (FALSE) - a novel active learning protocol for\nout-of-distribution active learning. Instead of defining sample importance on\nthe data representation directly, we formulate \"informativeness\" with learning\ndifficulty during training. Specifically, we approximate how often the network\n\"forgets\" unlabeled samples and query the most \"forgotten\" samples for\nannotation. We report up to 4.5\\% accuracy improvements in over 270\nexperiments, including four commonly used protocols, two OOD benchmarks, one\nin-distribution benchmark, and three different architectures.",

While creating a sound, or a soundy, analysis for Python remains an open\nproblem, we present in this work Serenity, a framework for static analysis of\nPython that turns out to be sufficient for some tasks.

We demonstrate the efficiency and usefulness of\nSerenity's analysis in two applications: code completion and automated machine\nlearning.

They also serve as the backbone for automatic\ndecision systems, e.g. for medical diagnostics and credit scoring. As\nstakeholders affected by these decisions would like to understand their\nsituation and verify fair decisions, a number of explanation approaches have\nbeen proposed using concepts in description logics. However, the learned\nconcepts can become long and difficult to fathom for non-experts, even when\nverbalized.

Counterfactuals answering the question \"How\nmust feature values be changed to obtain a different classification?\" have been\nproposed as short, human-friendly explanations for tabular data.

Counterfactual candidates are generated from concepts\nand the candidates with fewest feature changes are selected as counterfactuals.\nIn case of multiple counterfactuals, we rank them according to the likeliness\nof their feature combinations.

This is true even for\nthe now automated estimation of human poses, as domain-specific, sufficiently\nlarge data sets required for training computational models are either not\npublicly available or not indexed at a fine enough granularity.

In this\narticle, we consider the implications that AI art generation introduces through\na post-industrial revolution historical lens.

    "abstract": "In this work, we characterize a class of nonlinear monotone dynamical systems\nthat have a certain translation invariance property which goes by the name of\nplus-homogeneity; usually called \"topical\" systems. Such systems need not be\nasymptotically stable, since they are merely nonexpansive but not contractive.\nThus, we introduce a stricter version of monotonicity, termed \"type-K\" in honor\nof Kamke, and we prove the asymptotic stability of the equilibrium points, as\nwell as the convergence of all trajectories to such equilibria for type-K\nmonotone and plus-homogeneous systems: we call them \"K-topical\". Since topical\nmaps are the natural nonlinear counterpart of linear maps defined by\nrow-stochastic matrices, which are a cornerstone in the convergence analysis of\nlinear multi-agent systems (MASs), we exploit our results for solving the\nconsensus problem over nonlinear K-topical MASs. We first provide necessary and\nsufficient conditions on the local interaction rules of the agents ensuring the\nK-topicality of a MAS. Then, we prove that the agents achieve consensus\nasymptotically if the graph describing their interactions contains a globally\nreachable node. Finally, several examples for continuous-time and discrete-time\nsystems are discussed to corroborate the enforceability of our results in\ndifferent applications.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing integration of controllable distributed energy resources (DER)\nmakes distribution networks capable of aggregating flexible power and providing\nflexibility services at both transmission and distribution levels. The\naggregated flexibility of an active distribution network (ADN) can be\nrepresented as its feasible operating area in the P-Q space. The limits of this\narea are pivotal for arranging flexibility markets and coordinating\ntransmission and distribution system operators (TSOs and DSOs). However,\nmotivated by the current technical limitations of distribution networks (e.g.,\nprotection schemes), existing literature on ADN flexibility and TSO-DSO\ncoordination mostly focuses on radial networks, overlooking the potential\nbenefits of network reconfiguration. This paper, using a realistic meshed\ndistribution system from the UK and the exact ACOPF model for flexibility\nestimation, demonstrates that network reconfiguration can increase the limits\nof ADN aggregated flexibility and improve the economic efficiency of\nflexibility markets.",

    "abstract": "The resource demands of HPC applications vary significantly. However, it is\ncommon for HPC systems to assign resources on a per-node basis to prevent\ninterference from co-located workloads. This gap between the coarse-grained\nresource allocation and the varying resource demands can lead to\nunderutilization of HPC resources. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed\nthe resource usage and characteristics of NERSC Perlmutter, a state-of-the-art\nHPC system with both CPU-only and GPU-accelerated nodes. Our three-week usage\nanalysis revealed that the majority of jobs had low CPU utilization and that\naround 86% of both CPU and GPU-enabled jobs used 50% or less of the available\nhost memory. Additionally, 52.1% of GPU-enabled jobs used up to 25% of the GPU\nmemory, and the memory capacity was over-provisioned in some ways for all jobs.\nThe study also found that 60% of GPU-enabled jobs had idle GPUs, which could\nindicate that resource underutilization may occur as users adapt workflows to a\nsystem with new resources. Our research provides valuable insights into\nperformance characterization and offers new perspectives for system operators\nto understand and track the migration of workloads.

    "abstract": "Learning from large amounts of unsupervised data and a small amount of\nsupervision is an important open problem in computer vision. We propose a new\nsemi-supervised learning method, Semantic Positives via Pseudo-Labels (SemPPL),\nthat combines labelled and unlabelled data to learn informative\nrepresentations. Our method extends self-supervised contrastive learning --\nwhere representations are shaped by distinguishing whether two samples\nrepresent the same underlying datum (positives) or not (negatives) -- with a\nnovel approach to selecting positives. To enrich the set of positives, we\nleverage the few existing ground-truth labels to predict the missing ones\nthrough a $k$-nearest neighbours classifier by using the learned embeddings of\nthe labelled data. We thus extend the set of positives with datapoints having\nthe same pseudo-label and call these semantic positives. We jointly learn the\nrepresentation and predict bootstrapped pseudo-labels. This creates a\nreinforcing cycle. Strong initial representations enable better pseudo-label\npredictions which then improve the selection of semantic positives and lead to\neven better representations. SemPPL outperforms competing semi-supervised\nmethods setting new state-of-the-art performance of $68.5\\%$ and $76\\%$ top-$1$\naccuracy when using a ResNet-$50$ and training on $1\\%$ and $10\\%$ of labels on\nImageNet, respectively.

    "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning has become a powerful technique for several graph\nmining tasks. It learns discriminative representation from different\nperspectives of augmented graphs. Ubiquitous in our daily life, singed-directed\ngraphs are the most complex and tricky to analyze among various graph types.\nThat is why singed-directed graph contrastive learning has not been studied\nmuch yet, while there are many contrastive studies for unsigned and undirected.\nThus, this paper proposes a novel signed-directed graph contrastive learning,\nSDGCL. It makes two different structurally perturbed graph views and gets node\nrepresentations via magnetic Laplacian perturbation. We use a node-level\ncontrastive loss to maximize the mutual information between the two graph\nviews. The model is jointly learned with contrastive and supervised objectives.\nThe graph encoder of SDGCL does not depend on social theories or predefined\nassumptions. Therefore it does not require finding triads or selecting\nneighbors to aggregate. It leverages only the edge signs and directions via\nmagnetic Laplacian. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first to introduce\nmagnetic Laplacian perturbation and signed spectral graph contrastive learning.\nThe superiority of the proposed model is demonstrated through exhaustive\nexperiments on four real-world datasets.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of social welfare maximization in bilateral trade, where\ntwo agents, a buyer and a seller, trade an indivisible item. We consider\narguably the simplest form of mechanisms -- the fixed-price mechanisms, where\nthe designer offers trade at a fixed price to the seller and buyer. Besides the\nsimple form, fixed-price mechanisms are also the only DSIC and budget balanced\nmechanisms in bilateral trade.\nWe obtain improved approximation ratios of fixed-price mechanisms in both (i)\nthe full information setting, where the designer knows the value distributions\nof both the seller and buyer; and (ii) the limited information settings. In the\nfull information setting, we show that the optimal fixed-price mechanism can\nachieve at least $0.72$ of the optimal welfare, and no fixed-price mechanism\ncan achieve more than $0.7381$ of the optimal welfare. Prior to our result the\nstate of the art approximation ratio was $1 - 1/e + 0.0001\\approx 0.632$. We\nfurther consider two limited information settings. In the first one, the\ndesigner is only given the mean of the buyer's value (or the mean of the\nseller's value). We show that with such minimal information, one can already\ndesign a fixed-price mechanism that achieves $0.65$ of the optimal social\nwelfare, which surpasses the previous state of the art ratio in the full\ninformation setting. In the second one, we assume that the designer has access\nto more than one but still finitely many samples from the value distributions.\nWe propose a new family of sample-based fixed-price mechanisms called order\nstatistic mechanisms and provide a complete characterization of their\napproximation ratios for any fixed number of samples. Using the\ncharacterization, we provide the optimal approximation ratios obtainable by\norder statistic mechanism for small sample sizes and observe that they\nsignificantly outperform the single sample mechanism.",

In contrast to expensive\nmarker-based or multi-view systems, our lightweight setup is ideal for private\nusers as it enables an affordable 3D motion capture that is easy to install and\ndoes not require expert knowledge. To deal with this challenging setting, we\nleverage recent advances in computer vision using large-scale pre-trained\nmodels for a variety of modalities, including 2D body joints, joint angles,\nnormalized disparity maps, and human segmentation masks. Thus, we introduce the\nfirst non-linear optimization-based approach that jointly solves for the\nabsolute 3D position of each human, their articulated pose, their individual\nshapes as well as the scale of the scene. In particular, we estimate the scene\ndepth and person unique scale from normalized disparity predictions using the\n2D body joints and joint angles. Given the per-frame scene depth, we\nreconstruct a point-cloud of the static scene in 3D space. Finally, given the\nper-frame 3D estimates of the humans and scene point-cloud, we perform a\nspace-time coherent optimization over the video to ensure temporal, spatial and\nphysical plausibility. We evaluate our method on established multi-person 3D\nhuman pose benchmarks where we consistently outperform previous methods and we\nqualitatively demonstrate that our method is robust to in-the-wild conditions\nincluding challenging scenes with people of different sizes.",

    "abstract": "Rehearsal approaches in class incremental learning (CIL) suffer from decision\nboundary overfitting to new classes, which is mainly caused by two factors:\ninsufficiency of old classes data for knowledge distillation and imbalanced\ndata learning between the learned and new classes because of the limited\nstorage memory. In this work, we present a simple but effective approach to\ntackle these two factors. First, we employ a re-sampling strategy and Mixup\nK}nowledge D}istillation (Re-MKD) to improve the performances of KD, which\nwould greatly alleviate the overfitting problem. Specifically, we combine mixup\nand re-sampling strategies to synthesize adequate data used in KD training that\nare more consistent with the latent distribution between the learned and new\nclasses. Second, we propose a novel incremental influence balance (IIB) method\nfor CIL to tackle the classification of imbalanced data by extending the\ninfluence balance method into the CIL setting, which re-weights samples by\ntheir influences to create a proper decision boundary. With these two\nimprovements, we present the effective decision boundary learning algorithm\n(EDBL) which improves the performance of KD and deals with the imbalanced data\nlearning simultaneously. Experiments show that the proposed EDBL achieves\nstate-of-the-art performances on several CIL benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel LiDAR(-inertial) odometry and mapping\nframework to achieve the goal of simultaneous localization and meshing in\nreal-time. This proposed framework termed ImMesh comprises four tightly-coupled\nmodules: receiver, localization, meshing, and broadcaster. The localization\nmodule utilizes the prepossessed sensor data from the receiver, estimates the\nsensor pose online by registering LiDAR scans to maps, and dynamically grows\nthe map. Then, our meshing module takes the registered LiDAR scan for\nincrementally reconstructing the triangle mesh on the fly. Finally, the\nreal-time odometry, map, and mesh are published via our broadcaster. The key\ncontribution of this work is the meshing module, which represents a scene by an\nefficient hierarchical voxels structure, performs fast finding of voxels\nobserved by new scans, and reconstructs triangle facets in each voxel in an\nincremental manner. This voxel-wise meshing operation is delicately designed\nfor the purpose of efficiency; it first performs a dimension reduction by\nprojecting 3D points to a 2D local plane contained in the voxel, and then\nexecutes the meshing operation with pull, commit and push steps for incremental\nreconstruction of triangle facets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work in literature that can reconstruct online the triangle mesh of\nlarge-scale scenes, just relying on a standard CPU without GPU acceleration.

As a case study, we investigate the recently-discovered\nphenomenon of ``grokking'' exhibited by small transformers trained on modular\naddition tasks. We fully reverse engineer the algorithm learned by these\nnetworks, which uses discrete Fourier transforms and trigonometric identities\nto convert addition to rotation about a circle. We confirm the algorithm by\nanalyzing the activations and weights and by performing ablations in Fourier\nspace. Based on this understanding, we define progress measures that allow us\nto study the dynamics of training and split training into three continuous\nphases: memorization, circuit formation, and cleanup. Our results show that\ngrokking, rather than being a sudden shift, arises from the gradual\namplification of structured mechanisms encoded in the weights, followed by the\nlater removal of memorizing components.",

Meanwhile, we observe several\npapers have used (severely) sub-optimal hyper-parameters in pruning\nexperiments, while the reason behind them is also elusive. These sub-optimal\nhyper-parameters further exacerbate the distorted benchmarks, rendering the\nstate of neural network pruning even more obscure.\nTwo mysteries in pruning represent such a confusing status: the\nperformance-boosting effect of a larger finetuning learning rate, and the\nno-value argument of inheriting pretrained weights in filter pruning.\nIn this work, we attempt to explain the confusing state of network pruning by\ndemystifying the two mysteries. Specifically, (1) we first clarify the fairness\nprinciple in pruning experiments and summarize the widely-used comparison\nsetups; (2) then we unveil the two pruning mysteries and point out the central\nrole of network trainability, which has not been well recognized so far; (3)\nfinally, we conclude the paper and give some concrete suggestions regarding how\nto calibrate the pruning benchmarks in the future.

The think stage adopts a pre-trained\nlarge language model (LLM) to attend to the key concepts from candidates\nadaptively. It then transforms them into text context for prompting with a\nvisual captioning model and adopts the LLM to generate the answer. The confirm\nstage further uses the LLM to generate the supporting rationale to the answer,\nverify the generated rationale with a cross-modality classifier and ensure that\nthe rationale can infer the predicted output consistently. We conduct\nexperiments on a range of knowledge-based visual reasoning datasets. We found\nour IPVR enjoys several benefits, 1). it achieves better performance than the\nprevious few-shot learning baselines; 2). it enjoys the total transparency and\ntrustworthiness of the whole reasoning process by providing rationales for each\nreasoning step; 3). it is computation-efficient compared with other fine-tuning\nbaselines.",

    "abstract": "Segmentation of lung tissue in computed tomography (CT) images is a precursor\nto most pulmonary image analysis applications. Semantic segmentation methods\nusing deep learning have exhibited top-tier performance in recent years. This\npaper presents a fully automatic method for identifying the lungs in\nthree-dimensional (3D) pulmonary CT images, which we call it Lung-Net. We\nconjectured that a significant deeper network with inceptionV3 units can\nachieve a better feature representation of lung CT images without increasing\nthe model complexity in terms of the number of trainable parameters. The method\nhas three main advantages. First, a U-Net architecture with InceptionV3 blocks\nis developed to resolve the problem of performance degradation and parameter\noverload. Then, using information from consecutive slices, a new data structure\nis created to increase generalization potential, allowing more discriminating\nfeatures to be extracted by making data representation as efficient as\npossible. Finally, the robustness of the proposed segmentation framework was\nquantitatively assessed using one public database to train and test the model\n(LUNA16) and two public databases (ISBI VESSEL12 challenge and CRPF dataset)\nonly for testing the model; each database consists of 700, 23, and 40 CT\nimages, respectively, that were acquired with a different scanner and protocol.\nBased on the experimental results, the proposed method achieved competitive\nresults over the existing techniques with Dice coefficient of 99.7, 99.1, and\n98.8 for LUNA16, VESSEL12, and CRPF datasets, respectively. For segmenting lung\ntissue in CT images, the proposed model is efficient in terms of time and\nparameters and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, this\nmodel is publicly accessible via a graphical user interface.",

    "abstract": "Classification algorithms using RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data as input are\nused in a variety of biological applications. By nature, RNA-Seq data is\nsubject to uncontrolled fluctuations both within and especially across\ndatasets, which presents a major difficulty for a trained classifier to\ngeneralize to an external dataset. Replacing raw gene counts with the rank of\ngene counts inside an observation has proven effective to mitigate this\nproblem. However, the rank of a feature is by definition relative to all other\nfeatures, including highly variable features that introduce noise in the\nranking. To address this problem and obtain more robust ranks, we propose a\nlogistic regression model, optirank, which learns simultaneously the parameters\nof the model and the genes to use as a reference set in the ranking. We show\nthe effectiveness of this method on simulated data. We also consider real\nclassification tasks, which present different kinds of distribution shifts\nbetween train and test data. Those tasks concern a variety of applications,\nsuch as cancer of unknown primary classification, identification of specific\ngene signatures, and determination of cell type in single-cell RNA-Seq\ndatasets. On those real tasks, optirank performs at least as well as the\nvanilla logistic regression on classical ranks, while producing sparser\nsolutions. In addition, to increase the robustness against dataset shifts, we\npropose a multi-source learning scheme and demonstrate its effectiveness when\nused in combination with rank-based classifiers.",

    "abstract": "Clouds, especially low clouds, are crucial for regulating Earth's energy\nbalance and mediating the response of the climate system to changes in\ngreenhouse gas concentrations. Despite their importance for climate, they\nremain relatively poorly understood and are inaccurately represented in climate\nmodels. A principal reason is that the high computational expense of simulating\nthem with large-eddy simulations (LES) has inhibited broad and systematic\nnumerical experimentation and the generation of large datasets for training\nparametrization schemes for climate models. Here we demonstrate LES of low\nclouds on Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), application-specific integrated\ncircuits that were originally developed for machine learning applications. We\nshow that TPUs in conjunction with tailored software implementations can be\nused to simulate computationally challenging stratocumulus clouds in conditions\nobserved during the Dynamics and Chemistry of Marine Stratocumulus (DYCOMS)\nfield study. The TPU-based LES code successfully reproduces clouds during\nDYCOMS and opens up the large computational resources available on TPUs to\ncloud simulations. The code enables unprecedented weak and strong scaling of\nLES, making it possible, for example, to simulate stratocumulus with $10\\times$\nspeedup over real-time evolution in domains with a $34.7~\\mathrm{km} \\times\n53.8~\\mathrm{km}$ horizontal cross section.

Millimetre (mm)-waves and terahertz\n(THz) with high carrier frequency are proposed as the enabling technologies to\novercome Shannons channel capacity limit of existing communication systems by\nproviding ultrawide bandwidth signals. Mm-waves and THz are also able to build\nwireless links compatible with optical communication systems.

This method constructs a one-to-one mapping between individual\nstructure descriptors and spectral trends. Specifically, an adversarial\nautoencoder is augmented with a novel rank constraint (RankAAE). The RankAAE\nmethodology produces a continuous and interpretable latent space, where each\ndimension can track an individual structure descriptor. As a part of this\nprocess, the model provides a robust and quantitative measure of the\nstructure-spectrum relationship by decoupling intertwined spectral\ncontributions from multiple structural characteristics. This makes it ideal for\nspectral interpretation and the discovery of new descriptors. The capability of\nthis procedure is showcased by considering five local structure descriptors and\na database of over fifty thousand simulated XANES spectra across eight\nfirst-row transition metal oxide families. The resulting structure-spectrum\nrelationships not only reproduce known trends in the literature, but also\nreveal unintuitive ones that are visually indiscernible in large data sets.

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the capacity of graph neural networks to learn the\nfunctional form of ordinary differential equations that govern dynamics on\ncomplex networks. We propose necessary elements for such a problem, namely,\ninductive biases, a neural network architecture and a learning task.\nStatistical learning theory suggests that generalisation power of neural\nnetworks relies on independence and identical distribution (i.i.d.)\\ of\ntraining and testing data. Although this assumption together with an\nappropriate neural architecture and a learning mechanism is sufficient for\naccurate out-of-sample predictions of dynamics such as, e.g.\\ mass-action\nkinetics, by studying the out-of-distribution generalisation in the case of\ndiffusion dynamics, we find that the neural network model: (i) has a\ngeneralisation capacity that depends on the first moment of the initial value\ndata distribution; (ii) learns the non-dissipative nature of dynamics\nimplicitly; and (iii) the model's accuracy resolution limit is of order\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{n})$ for a system of size $n$.",

    "title": "Lesion-aware Dynamic Kernel for Polyp Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Automatic and accurate polyp segmentation plays an essential role in early\ncolorectal cancer diagnosis. However, it has always been a challenging task due\nto 1) the diverse shape, size, brightness and other appearance characteristics\nof polyps, 2) the tiny contrast between concealed polyps and their surrounding\nregions. To address these problems, we propose a lesion-aware dynamic network\n(LDNet) for polyp segmentation, which is a traditional u-shape encoder-decoder\nstructure incorporated with a dynamic kernel generation and updating scheme.\nSpecifically, the designed segmentation head is conditioned on the global\ncontext features of the input image and iteratively updated by the extracted\nlesion features according to polyp segmentation predictions. This simple but\neffective scheme endows our model with powerful segmentation performance and\ngeneralization capability. Besides, we utilize the extracted lesion\nrepresentation to enhance the feature contrast between the polyp and background\nregions by a tailored lesion-aware cross-attention module (LCA), and design an\nefficient self-attention module (ESA) to capture long-range context relations,\nfurther improving the segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on four\npublic polyp benchmarks and our collected large-scale polyp dataset demonstrate\nthe superior performance of our method compared with other state-of-the-art\napproaches.

Here we develop\nProxSPS, a proximal variant of SPS that can handle regularization terms.\nDeveloping a proximal variant of SPS is particularly important, since SPS\nrequires a lower bound of the objective function to work well. When the\nobjective function is the sum of a loss and a regularizer, available estimates\nof a lower bound of the sum can be loose. In contrast, ProxSPS only requires a\nlower bound for the loss which is often readily available. As a consequence, we\nshow that ProxSPS is easier to tune and more stable in the presence of\nregularization. Furthermore for image classification tasks, ProxSPS performs as\nwell as AdamW with little to no tuning, and results in a network with smaller\nweight parameters. We also provide an extensive convergence analysis for\nProxSPS that includes the non-smooth, smooth, weakly convex and strongly convex\nsetting.",

The framework of diversity of solutions is a\nyoung and thriving topic in the field of artificial intelligence. The main idea\nis to provide the user with not just one, but with a set of different\nsolutions, enabling her to pick a sufficiently good solution that satisfies\nadditional subjective criteria that are hard or impossible to model.\nIn this work, we use a quantum annealer to solve the KRA problem and to\ncompute a representative set of solutions. Quantum annealing is a meta search\nheuristic that does not only show promising runtime behavior on currently\nexisting prototypes but also samples the solutions space in an inherently\ndifferent way, making use of quantum effects. We describe how KRA instances can\nbe solved by a quantum annealer and provide an implementation as well as\nexperimental evaluations. As existing quantum annealers are still restricted in\ntheir number of qubits, we further implement two different data reduction rules\nthat can split an instance into a set of smaller instances.
