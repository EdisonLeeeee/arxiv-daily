    "abstract": "An effective framework for learning 3D representations for perception tasks\nis distilling rich self-supervised image features via contrastive learning.\nHowever, image-to point representation learning for autonomous driving datasets\nfaces two main challenges: 1) the abundance of self-similarity, which results\nin the contrastive losses pushing away semantically similar point and image\nregions and thus disturbing the local semantic structure of the learned\nrepresentations, and 2) severe class imbalance as pretraining gets dominated by\nover-represented classes. We propose to alleviate the self-similarity problem\nthrough a novel semantically tolerant image-to-point contrastive loss that\ntakes into consideration the semantic distance between positive and negative\nimage regions to minimize contrasting semantically similar point and image\nregions. Additionally, we address class imbalance by designing a class-agnostic\nbalanced loss that approximates the degree of class imbalance through an\naggregate sample-to-samples semantic similarity measure. We demonstrate that\nour semantically-tolerant contrastive loss with class balancing improves\nstate-of-the art 2D-to-3D representation learning in all evaluation settings on\n3D semantic segmentation. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\n2D-to-3D representation learning frameworks across a wide range of 2D\nself-supervised pretrained models.",

    "abstract": "The recent trend for multi-camera 3D object detection is through the unified\nbird's-eye view (BEV) representation. However, directly transforming features\nextracted from the image-plane view to BEV inevitably results in feature\ndistortion, especially around the objects of interest, making the objects blur\ninto the background. To this end, we propose OA-BEV, a network that can be\nplugged into the BEV-based 3D object detection framework to bring out the\nobjects by incorporating object-aware pseudo-3D features and depth features.\nSuch features contain information about the object's position and 3D\nstructures. First, we explicitly guide the network to learn the depth\ndistribution by object-level supervision from each 3D object's center. Then, we\nselect the foreground pixels by a 2D object detector and project them into 3D\nspace for pseudo-voxel feature encoding. Finally, the object-aware depth\nfeatures and pseudo-voxel features are incorporated into the BEV representation\nwith a deformable attention mechanism. We conduct extensive experiments on the\nnuScenes dataset to validate the merits of our proposed OA-BEV. Our method\nachieves consistent improvements over the BEV-based baselines in terms of both\naverage precision and nuScenes detection score. Our codes will be published.",

    "abstract": "Deep supervised learning algorithms generally require large numbers of\nlabeled examples to attain satisfactory performance. To avoid the expensive\ncost incurred by collecting and labeling too many examples, as a subset of\nunsupervised learning, self-supervised learning (SSL) was proposed to learn\ngood features from many unlabeled examples without any human-annotated labels.\nSSL has recently become a hot research topic, and many related algorithms have\nbeen proposed. However, few comprehensive studies have explained the\nconnections among different SSL variants and how they have evolved. In this\npaper, we attempt to provide a review of the various SSL methods from the\nperspectives of algorithms, theory, applications, three main trends, and open\nquestions. First, the motivations of most SSL algorithms are introduced in\ndetail, and their commonalities and differences are compared. Second, the\ntheoretical issues associated with SSL are investigated. Third, typical\napplications of SSL in areas such as image processing and computer vision (CV),\nas well as natural language processing (NLP), are discussed.

This problem is important for societal applications such as eco-routing,\nwhich aims to find paths with the lowest exhaust emissions or energy need. The\nchallenges of this problem are three-fold: (1) the dependence of a vehicle's\neco-toll on its physical parameters; (2) the lack of access to data with\neco-toll information; and (3) the influence of contextual information (i.e. the\nconnections of adjacent segments in the path) on the eco-toll of road segments.\nPrior work on eco-toll estimation has mostly relied on pure data-driven\napproaches and has high estimation errors given the limited training data. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel Eco-toll estimation\nPhysics-informed Neural Network framework (Eco-PiNN) using three novel ideas,\nnamely, (1) a physics-informed decoder that integrates the physical laws of the\nvehicle engine into the network, (2) an attention-based contextual information\nencoder, and (3) a physics-informed regularization to reduce overfitting.\nExperiments on real-world heavy-duty truck data show that the proposed method\ncan greatly improve the accuracy of eco-toll estimation compared with\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Concurrent objects form the foundation of many applications that exploit\nmulticore architectures. Reasoning about the fine-grained complexities\n(interleavings, invariants, etc.) of those data structures, however, is\nnotoriously difficult. Formal proof methodologies for arguing about the\ncorrectness -- i.e.,~linearizability -- of these data structures are still\nsomewhat disconnected from the intuitive correctness arguments. Intuitions are\noften about a few canonical executions, possibly with few threads, whereas\nformal proofs would often use generic but complex arguments about arbitrary\ninterleavings over unboundedly many threads.\nAs a way to bring formal proofs closer to intuitive arguments, we introduce a\nnew methodology for characterizing the interleavings of concurrent objects,\nbased on their \\emph{commutativity quotient}. This quotient represents every\ninterleaving up to reordering of commutative steps and, when chosen carefully,\nadmits simple abstractions in the form of regular or context-free languages\nthat enable simple proofs of linearizability. We demonstrate these facts on a\nlarge class of lock-free data structures and the infamously difficult\nHerlihy-Wing Queue. We automate the discovery of these execution quotients and\nshow it can be automatically done for challenging data-structures such as\nTreiber's stack, Michael/Scott Queue, and a concurrent Set implemented as a\nlinked list.",

In this article, we present a platform for\ndistributing computer simulations on resources available on a network using\ncontainers that abstracts the complexity needed to configure these execution\nenvironments and allows any user can benefit from this infrastructure.\nSimulations could be developed in any programming language (like Python, Java,\nC, R) and with specific execution needs within reach of the scientific\ncommunity in a general way. We will present results obtained in running\nsimulations that required more than 1000 runs with different initial parameters\nand various other experiments that benefited from using the platform.",

If you have not read those works,\nI refer you to the \"Important Reading for Ethical Model Building\" list at the\nend of this paper as it will help give you a framework on how to think about\nMachine Learning models more holistically taking into account their effect on\nmarginalized people. In the Introduction to this chapter, I root the\nsignificance of their work in real world examples of what happens when models\nare deployed without transparent data collected for the training process and\nare deployed without the practitioners paying special attention to what happens\nto models that adapt to exploit gaps between their training environment and the\nreal world. The rest of this chapter builds on the work of the aforementioned\nresearchers and discusses the reality of models performing post production and\ndetails ways ML practitioners can identify bias using tools during the MLOps\nlifecycle to mitigate bias that may be introduced to models in the real world.",

However, it is difficult for humans to\nconstruct optimal activation functions, and current activation function search\nalgorithms are prohibitively expensive. This paper aims to improve the state of\nthe art through three steps: First, the benchmark datasets Act-Bench-CNN,\nAct-Bench-ResNet, and Act-Bench-ViT were created by training convolutional,\nresidual, and vision transformer architectures from scratch with 2,913\nsystematically generated activation functions. Second, a characterization of\nthe benchmark space was developed, leading to a new surrogate-based method for\noptimization. More specifically, the spectrum of the Fisher information matrix\nassociated with the model's predictive distribution at initialization and the\nactivation function's output distribution were found to be highly predictive of\nperformance. Third, the surrogate was used to discover improved activation\nfunctions in CIFAR-100 and ImageNet tasks. Each of these steps is a\ncontribution in its own right; together they serve as a practical and\ntheoretical foundation for further research on activation function\noptimization.

    "abstract": "Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [40] trains classifiers under a strict\nmemory budget: in each incremental phase, learning is done for new data, most\nof which is abandoned to free space for the next phase. The preserved data are\nexemplars used for replaying. However, existing methods use a static and ad hoc\nstrategy for memory allocation, which is often sub-optimal. In this work, we\npropose a dynamic memory management strategy that is optimized for the\nincremental phases and different object classes. We call our method reinforced\nmemory management (RMM), leveraging reinforcement learning. RMM training is not\nnaturally compatible with CIL as the past, and future data are strictly\nnon-accessible during the incremental phases. We solve this by training the\npolicy function of RMM on pseudo CIL tasks, e.g., the tasks built on the data\nof the 0-th phase, and then applying it to target tasks. RMM propagates two\nlevels of actions: Level-1 determines how to split the memory between old and\nnew classes, and Level-2 allocates memory for each specific class. In essence,\nit is an optimizable and general method for memory management that can be used\nin any replaying-based CIL method. For evaluation, we plug RMM into two\ntop-performing baselines (LUCIR+AANets and POD+AANets [30]) and conduct\nexperiments on three benchmarks (CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Subset, and\nImageNet-Full).

    "abstract": "In recent years, representations given by fully connected neural networks\nhave shown to represent scenes, objects, and other measurements well in dense\nlow-dimensional settings. For these models, termed coordinate based MLPs,\nsinusoidal encodings are necessary in allowing for convergence to the high\nfrequency components of the target function. This requirement is a result of\ntheir severe spectral bias when using dense, low dimensional coordinate based\ninputs. Previous work explained this phenomena using Neural Tangent Kernel\n(NTK) and Fourier analysis. While these methods provide insight towards this\nlarge spectral bias and the benefits of positional encoding, the properties of\nReLU networks that induce this behavior are not fully determined. Analyzing\nspectral bias directly through the computations of ReLU networks would expose\ntheir limitations in dense settings, while providing a clearer explanation as\nto how this behavior emerges during the learning process. In this paper, we\nsystematically analyze the spectral bias of a coordinate based MLP through its\nactivation regions and gradient descent dynamics. This allows us to relate the\nnetwork's expressive capacity to the speed at which gradient descent converges\nfor components of varying frequency, and how the density of the data further\nrestricts the model.",

Sharing a unified backbone design that reconstructs\nhand gestures in real-time, our reconfigurable data glove operates in three\nmodes for various downstream tasks with distinct features. In the\ntactile-sensing mode, the glove system aggregates manipulation force via\ncustomized force sensors made from a soft and thin piezoresistive material;\nthis design is to minimize interference during complex hand movements. The\nVirtual Reality (VR) mode enables real-time interaction in a physically\nplausible fashion; a caging-based approach is devised to determine stable\ngrasps by detecting collision events. Leveraging a state-of-the-art Finite\nElement Method (FEM) simulator, the simulation mode collects a fine-grained 4D\nmanipulation event: hand and object motions in 3D space and how the object's\nphysical properties (e.g., stress, energy) change in accord with the\nmanipulation in time. Of note, this glove system is the first to look into,\nthrough high-fidelity simulation, the unobservable physical and causal factors\nbehind manipulation actions. In a series of experiments, we characterize our\ndata glove in terms of individual sensors and the overall system. Specifically,\nwe evaluate the system's three modes by (i) recording hand gestures and\nassociated forces, (ii) improving manipulation fluency in VR, and (iii)\nproducing realistic simulation effects of various tool uses, respectively.\nTogether, our reconfigurable data glove collects and reconstructs fine-grained\nhuman grasp data in both the physical and virtual environments, opening up new\navenues to learning manipulation skills for embodied AI agents.",

Their learning processes should be\nbased on interactions with their physical and social world in the manner of\nhuman learning and cognitive development. Based on this context, in this paper,\nwe focus on the two concepts of world models and predictive coding. Recently,\nworld models have attracted renewed attention as a topic of considerable\ninterest in artificial intelligence. Cognitive systems learn world models to\nbetter predict future sensory observations and optimize their policies, i.e.,\ncontrollers. Alternatively, in neuroscience, predictive coding proposes that\nthe brain continuously predicts its inputs and adapts to model its own dynamics\nand control behavior in its environment. Both ideas may be considered as\nunderpinning the cognitive development of robots and humans capable of\ncontinual or lifelong learning. Although many studies have been conducted on\npredictive coding in cognitive robotics and neurorobotics, the relationship\nbetween world model-based approaches in AI and predictive coding in robotics\nhas rarely been discussed. Therefore, in this paper, we clarify the\ndefinitions, relationships, and status of current research on these topics, as\nwell as missing pieces of world models and predictive coding in conjunction\nwith crucially related concepts such as the free-energy principle and active\ninference in the context of cognitive and developmental robotics. Furthermore,\nwe outline the frontiers and challenges involved in world models and predictive\ncoding toward the further integration of AI and robotics, as well as the\ncreation of robots with real cognitive and developmental capabilities in the\nfuture.",

Our approach is fully unsupervised and can\nlead to high-quality correspondences even in challenging cases such as sparse\npoint clouds or non-isometric meshes, where current methods fail. Our first key\nobservation is that, in line with neural priors observed in other domains,\nrecent network architectures on 3D data, even without training, tend to produce\npointwise features that induce plausible maps between rigid or non-rigid\nshapes. Secondly, we show that given a noisy map as input, training a feature\nextraction network with the input map as supervision tends to remove artifacts\nfrom the input and can act as a powerful correspondence denoising mechanism,\nboth between individual pairs and within a collection. With these observations\nin hand, we propose a two-stage unsupervised paradigm for shape matching by (i)\nperforming unsupervised training by adapting an existing approach to obtain an\ninitial set of noisy matches, and (ii) using these matches to train a network\nin a supervised manner. We demonstrate that this approach significantly\nimproves the accuracy of the maps, especially when trained within a collection.\nWe show that NCP is data-efficient, fast, and achieves state-of-the-art results\non many tasks.

We begin by modeling the\nquadrotors as particles in the YZ-plane evolving under dynamics with uncertain\nstate information.

Results\nfrom numerical simulations show that for the planar quadrotor model considered\n-- with uncertainty in sensor measurements modeled as Gaussian noise -- the\nresulting optimal control is able to drive each agent to achieve the desired\nglobal objective: leader trajectory tracking with formation maintenance.\nFinally, we evaluate the performance of the control law using the tracking and\nformation errors of the multiagent system.",

Unfortunately, pedestrian-detection-based systems can be\nhindered in certain situations such as nighttime or when pedestrians are\noccluded. Our system, CHAMP (Crowdsourced, History-based Advisories of Mapped\nPedestrians), addresses such issues using an online, map-based pedestrian\ndetection system where pedestrian locations are aggregated into a dataset after\nrepeated passes of locations. Using this dataset, we are able to learn\npedestrian zones and generate advisory notices when a vehicle is approaching a\npedestrian despite challenges like dark lighting or pedestrian occlusion. We\ncollected and carefully annotated pedestrian data in La Jolla, CA to construct\ntraining and test sets of pedestrian locations. Moreover, we use the number of\ncorrect advisories, false advisories, and missed advisories to define precision\nand recall performance metrics to evaluate CHAMP.

Further, we extract distilled knowledge from CrysGNN and inject\ninto different state of the art property predictors to enhance their property\nprediction accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments to show that with\ndistilled knowledge from the pre-trained model, all the SOTA algorithms are\nable to outperform their own vanilla version with good margins.

However, we note that current label assignment strategies barely\nconsider the characteristics of targets in remote sensing images thoroughly,\nsuch as large variations in orientations, aspect ratios and scales, which lead\nto insufficient sampling. In this paper, an Elliptical Distribution aided\nAdaptive Rotation Label Assignment (EARL) is proposed to select positive\nsamples with higher quality in orientation detectors, and yields better\nperformance. Concretely, to avoid inadequate sampling of targets with extreme\nscales, an adaptive scale sampling (ADS) strategy is proposed to dynamically\nselect samples on different feature levels according to the scales of targets.\nTo enhance ADS, positive samples are selected following a dynamic elliptical\ndistribution (DED), which can further exploit the orientation and shape\nproperties of targets. Moreover, a spatial distance weighting (SDW) module is\nintroduced to mitigate the influence from low-quality samples on detection\nperformance. Extensive experiments on popular remote sensing datasets, such as\nDOTA and HRSC2016, demonstrate the effectiveness and the superiority of our\nproposed EARL, where without bells and whistles, it achieves 72.87 of mAP on\nDOTA dataset by being integrated with simple structure, which outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art anchor-free detectors and provides comparable\nperformance as anchor-based methods.

    "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks have been widely used in scene\nclassification of remotely sensed images. In this work, we propose a robust\nlearning method for the task that is secure against partially incorrect\ncategorization of images. Specifically, we remove and correct errors in the\nlabels progressively by iterative multi-view voting and entropy ranking. At\neach time step, we first divide the training data into disjoint parts for\nseparate training and voting. The unanimity in the voting reveals the\ncorrectness of the labels, so that we can train a strong model with only the\nimages with unanimous votes. In addition, we adopt entropy as an effective\nmeasure for prediction uncertainty, in order to partially recover labeling\nerrors by ranking and selection. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of\nthe proposed method on the WHU-RS19 dataset and the AID dataset.",

    "title": "A Comprehensive Survey of Graph-level Learning",
    "abstract": "Graphs have a superior ability to represent relational data, like chemical\ncompounds, proteins, and social networks. Hence, graph-level learning, which\ntakes a set of graphs as input, has been applied to many tasks including\ncomparison, regression, classification, and more. Traditional approaches to\nlearning a set of graphs tend to rely on hand-crafted features, such as\nsubstructures. But while these methods benefit from good interpretability, they\noften suffer from computational bottlenecks as they cannot skirt the graph\nisomorphism problem. Conversely, deep learning has helped graph-level learning\nadapt to the growing scale of graphs by extracting features automatically and\ndecoding graphs into low-dimensional representations. As a result, these deep\ngraph learning methods have been responsible for many successes. Yet, there is\nno comprehensive survey that reviews graph-level learning starting with\ntraditional learning and moving through to the deep learning approaches. This\narticle fills this gap and frames the representative algorithms into a\nsystematic taxonomy covering traditional learning, graph-level deep neural\nnetworks, graph-level graph neural networks, and graph pooling. To ensure a\nthoroughly comprehensive survey, the evolutions, interactions, and\ncommunications between methods from four different branches of development are\nalso examined. This is followed by a brief review of the benchmark data sets,\nevaluation metrics, and common downstream applications. The survey concludes\nwith 13 future directions of necessary research that will help to overcome the\nchallenges facing this booming field.",

    "abstract": "In-memory key-value stores (IMKVSes) serve many online applications because\nof their efficiency. To support data backup, popular industrial IMKVSes\nperiodically take a point-in-time snapshot of the in-memory data with the\nsystem call fork. However, this mechanism can result in latency spikes for\nqueries arriving during the snapshot period because fork leads the engine into\nthe kernel mode in which the engine is out-of-service for queries. In contrast\nto existing research focusing on optimizing snapshot algorithms, we optimize\nthe fork operation to address the latency spikes problem from the operating\nsystem (OS) level, while keeping the data persistent mechanism in IMKVSes\nunchanged. Specifically, we first conduct an in-depth study to reveal the\nimpact of the fork operation as well as the optimization techniques on query\nlatency. Based on findings in the study, we propose Async-fork to offload the\nwork of copying the page table from the engine (the parent process) to the\nchild process as copying the page table dominates the execution time of fork.\nTo keep data consistent between the parent and the child, we design the\nproactive synchronization strategy. Async-fork is implemented in the Linux\nkernel and deployed into the online Redis database in public clouds. Our\nexperiment results show that compared with the default fork method in OS,\nAsync-fork reduces the tail latency of queries arriving during the snapshot\nperiod by 81.76% on an 8GB instance and 99.84% on a 64GB instance.",

    "abstract": "A myriad of studies addressed the problem of rumor verification in Twitter by\neither utilizing evidence from the propagation networks or external evidence\nfrom the Web. However, none of these studies exploited evidence from trusted\nauthorities. In this paper, we define the task of detecting the stance of\nauthorities towards rumors in tweets, i.e., whether a tweet from an authority\nagrees, disagrees, or is unrelated to the rumor. We believe the task is useful\nto augment the sources of evidence utilized by existing rumor verification\nsystems. We construct and release the first Authority STance towards Rumors\n(AuSTR) dataset, where evidence is retrieved from authority timelines in Arabic\nTwitter. Due to the relatively limited size of our dataset, we study the\nusefulness of existing datasets for stance detection in our task. We show that\nexisting datasets are somewhat useful for the task; however, they are clearly\ninsufficient, which motivates the need to augment them with annotated data\nconstituting stance of authorities from Twitter.",

Our\ncontributions are two-fold. First, we leverage multi-view correlation through a\nseries of self- and cross-attention layers in order to obtain enhanced depth\nfeature representation.

To\nimprove the motion field predictions, we propose an iterative optimization\nstrategy, together with a sparsity-regularized loss.

    "abstract": "Team competition in multi-agent Markov games is an increasingly important\nsetting for multi-agent reinforcement learning, due to its general\napplicability in modeling many real-life situations. Multi-agent actor-critic\nmethods are the most suitable class of techniques for learning optimal policies\nin the team competition setting, due to their flexibility in learning\nagent-specific critic functions, which can also learn from other agents. In\nmany real-world team competitive scenarios, the roles of the agents naturally\nemerge, in order to aid in coordination and collaboration within members of the\nteams. However, existing methods for learning emergent roles rely heavily on\nthe Q-learning setup which does not allow learning of agent-specific\nQ-functions. In this paper, we propose RAC, a novel technique for learning the\nemergent roles of agents within a team that are diverse and dynamic. In the\nproposed method, agents also benefit from predicting the roles of the agents in\nthe opponent team. RAC uses the actor-critic framework with role encoder and\nopponent role predictors for learning an optimal policy. Experimentation using\n2 games demonstrates that the policies learned by RAC achieve higher rewards\nthan those learned using state-of-the-art baselines.

    "abstract": "The syllable is a perceptually salient unit in speech. Since both the\nsyllable and its acoustic correlate, i.e., the speech envelope, have a\npreferred range of rhythmicity between 4 and 8 Hz, it is hypothesized that\ntheta-band neural oscillations play a major role in extracting syllables based\non the envelope. A literature survey, however, reveals inconsistent evidence\nabout the relationship between speech envelope and syllables, and the current\nstudy revisits this question by analyzing large speech corpora. It is shown\nthat the center frequency of speech envelope, characterized by the modulation\nspectrum, reliably correlates with the rate of syllables only when the analysis\nis pooled over minutes of speech recordings. In contrast, in the time domain, a\ncomponent of the speech envelope is reliably phase-locked to syllable onsets.\nBased on a speaker-independent model, the timing of syllable onsets explains\nabout 24% variance of the speech envelope. These results indicate that local\nfeatures in the speech envelope, instead of the modulation spectrum, are a more\nreliable acoustic correlate of syllables.",

First, the mathematical models of the static and\neigenproblems are formulated in great detail. The FG material properties are\nassumed to vary smoothly and continuously throughout three directions of the\nplate according to a Mori-Tanaka micromechanics model distribution of volume\nfraction of constituents. Then, finite element analysis (FEA) with mixed\ninterpolation of tensorial components of 4-nodes (MITC4) is implemented in\norder to eliminate theoretically a shear locking phenomenon existing. Next,\ninfluences of the variable thickness functions (uniform, non-uniform linear,\nand non-uniform non-linear), material properties, length-to-thickness ratio,\nboundary conditions, and elastic parameters on the plate response are\ninvestigated and discussed in detail through several numerical examples.\nFinally, a deep neural network (DNN) technique using batch normalization (BN)\nis learned to predict the non-dimensional values of multi-directional FG\nplates. The DNN model also shows that it is a powerful technique capable of\nhandling an extensive database and different vital parameters in engineering\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Drug combination therapy is a well-established strategy for disease treatment\nwith better effectiveness and less safety degradation. However, identifying\nnovel drug combinations through wet-lab experiments is resource intensive due\nto the vast combinatorial search space. Recently, computational approaches,\nspecifically deep learning models have emerged as an efficient way to discover\nsynergistic combinations. While previous methods reported fair performance,\ntheir models usually do not take advantage of multi-modal data and they are\nunable to handle new drugs or cell lines. In this study, we collected data from\nvarious datasets covering various drug-related aspects. Then, we take advantage\nof large-scale pre-training models to generate informative representations and\nfeatures for drugs, proteins, and diseases. Based on that, a message-passing\ngraph is built on top to propagate information together with graph structure\nlearning flexibility. This is first introduced in the biological networks and\nenables us to generate pseudo-relations in the graph. Our framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in comparison with other deep learning-based methods\non synergistic prediction benchmark datasets. We are also capable of\ninferencing new drug combination data in a test on an independent set released\nby AstraZeneca, where 10% of improvement over previous methods is observed. In\naddition, we're robust against unseen drugs and surpass almost 15% AU ROC\ncompared to the second-best model.

    "abstract": "The evaluation of Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems has\ntraditionally used metrics based on the edit distance between HTR and ground\ntruth (GT) transcripts, at both the character and word levels. This is very\nadequate when the experimental protocol assumes that both GT and HTR text lines\nare the same, which allows edit distances to be independently computed to each\ngiven line. Driven by recent advances in pattern recognition, HTR systems\nincreasingly face the end-to-end page-level transcription of a document, where\nthe precision of locating the different text lines and their corresponding\nreading order (RO) play a key role. In such a case, the standard metrics do not\ntake into account the inconsistencies that might appear. In this paper, the\nproblem of evaluating HTR systems at the page level is introduced in detail. We\nanalyze the convenience of using a two-fold evaluation, where the transcription\naccuracy and the RO goodness are considered separately. Different alternatives\nare proposed, analyzed and empirically compared both through partially\nsimulated and through real, full end-to-end experiments. Results support the\nvalidity of the proposed two-fold evaluation approach. An important conclusion\nis that such an evaluation can be adequately achieved by just two simple and\nwell-known metrics: the Word Error Rate, that takes transcription sequentiality\ninto account, and the here re-formulated Bag of Words Word Error Rate, that\nignores order. While the latter directly and very accurately assess intrinsic\nword recognition errors, the difference between both metrics gracefully\ncorrelates with the Spearman's Foot Rule Distance, a metric which explicitly\nmeasures RO errors associated with layout analysis flaws.",

In this paper, we\nstudy the spatial disequilibrium problem of modern object detectors and propose\nto quantify this ``spatial bias'' by measuring the detection performance over\nzones. Our analysis surprisingly shows that the spatial imbalance of objects\nhas a great impact on the detection performance, limiting the robustness of\ndetection applications. This motivates us to design a more generalized\nmeasurement, termed Spatial equilibrium Precision (SP), to better characterize\nthe detection performance of object detectors. Furthermore, we also present a\nspatial equilibrium label assignment (SELA) to alleviate the spatial\ndisequilibrium problem by injecting the prior spatial weight into the\noptimization process of detectors. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC, MS\nCOCO, and 3 application datasets on face mask/fruit/helmet images demonstrate\nthe advantages of our method. Our findings challenge the conventional sense of\nobject detectors and show the indispensability of spatial equilibrium.

    "title": "Unveiling the Hidden Agenda: Biases in News Reporting and Consumption",
    "abstract": "One of the most pressing challenges in the digital media landscape is\nunderstanding the impact of biases on the news sources that people rely on for\ninformation. Biased news can have significant and far-reaching consequences,\ninfluencing our perspectives and shaping the decisions we make, potentially\nendangering the public and individual well-being. With the advent of the\nInternet and social media, discussions have moved online, making it easier to\ndisseminate both accurate and inaccurate information. To combat mis- and\ndis-information, many have begun to evaluate the reliability of news sources,\nbut these assessments often only examine the validity of the news (narrative\nbias) and neglect other types of biases, such as the deliberate selection of\nevents to favor certain perspectives (selection bias). This paper aims to\ninvestigate these biases in various news sources and their correlation with\nthird-party evaluations of reliability, engagement, and online audiences. Using\nmachine learning to classify content, we build a six-year dataset on the\nItalian vaccine debate and adopt a Bayesian latent space model to identify\nnarrative and selection biases. Our results show that the source classification\nprovided by third-party organizations closely follows the narrative bias\ndimension, while it is much less accurate in identifying the selection bias.\nMoreover, we found a nonlinear relationship between biases and engagement, with\nhigher engagement for extreme positions. Lastly, analysis of news consumption\non Twitter reveals common audiences among news outlets with similar ideological\npositions.",

    "abstract": "Pioneering data profiling systems such as Metanome and OpenClean brought\npublic attention to science-intensive data profiling. This type of profiling\naims to extract complex patterns (primitives) such as functional dependencies,\ndata constraints, association rules, and others. However, these tools are\nresearch prototypes rather than production-ready systems.\nThe following work presents Desbordante - a high-performance\nscience-intensive data profiler with open source code. Unlike similar systems,\nit is built with emphasis on industrial application in a multi-user\nenvironment. It is efficient, resilient to crashes, and scalable. Its\nefficiency is ensured by implementing discovery algorithms in C++, resilience\nis achieved by extensive use of containerization, and scalability is based on\nreplication of containers.\nDesbordante aims to open industrial-grade primitive discovery to a broader\npublic, focusing on domain experts who are not IT professionals. Aside from the\ndiscovery of various primitives, Desbordante offers primitive validation, which\nnot only reports whether a given instance of primitive holds or not, but also\npoints out what prevents it from holding via the use of special screens. Next,\nDesbordante supports pipelines - ready-to-use functionality implemented using\nthe discovered primitives, for example, typo detection. We provide built-in\npipelines, and the users can construct their own via provided Python bindings.\nUnlike other profilers, Desbordante works not only with tabular data, but with\ngraph and transactional data as well.\nIn this paper, we present Desbordante, the vision behind it and its\nuse-cases. To provide a more in-depth perspective, we discuss its current\nstate, architecture, and design decisions it is built on. Additionally, we\noutline our future plans.",

    "abstract": "Industrial robots are widely used in various manufacturing environments due\nto their efficiency in doing repetitive tasks such as assembly or welding. A\ncommon problem for these applications is to reach a destination without\ncolliding with obstacles or other robot arms. Commonly used sampling-based path\nplanning approaches such as RRT require long computation times, especially in\ncomplex environments. Furthermore, the environment in which they are employed\nneeds to be known beforehand. When utilizing the approaches in new\nenvironments, a tedious engineering effort in setting hyperparameters needs to\nbe conducted, which is time- and cost-intensive. On the other hand, Deep\nReinforcement Learning has shown remarkable results in dealing with unknown\nenvironments, generalizing new problem instances, and solving motion planning\nproblems efficiently. On that account, this paper proposes a\nDeep-Reinforcement-Learning-based motion planner for robotic manipulators.

In this paper, we consider the\nproblem of maximizing dynamic risk of a sequence of rewards in infinite-horizon\nMarkov Decision Processes (MDPs). We adapt the Expected Conditional Risk\nMeasures (ECRMs) to the infinite-horizon risk-averse MDP and prove its time\nconsistency. Using a convex combination of expectation and conditional\nvalue-at-risk (CVaR) as a special one-step conditional risk measure, we\nreformulate the risk-averse MDP as a risk-neutral counterpart with augmented\naction space and manipulation on the immediate rewards. We further prove that\nthe related Bellman operator is a contraction mapping, which guarantees the\nconvergence of any value-based RL algorithms. Accordingly, we develop a\nrisk-averse deep Q-learning framework, and our numerical studies based on two\nsimple MDPs show that the risk-averse setting can reduce the variance and\nenhance robustness of the results.",

These systems are represented by the\nPoisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations coupled with the Navier-Stokes (NS)\nequation. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) to accurately capture the\nspatio-temporal variation of ion concentration and current flux remains\nchallenging due to the (a) small critical dimension of the electric double\nlayer (EDL), (b) stiff coupling, large advective effects, and steep gradients\nclose to boundaries, and (c) complex geometries exhibited by electrochemical\ndevices.\nIn the current study, we address these challenges by presenting a direct\nnumerical simulation framework that incorporates: (a) a variational multiscale\n(VMS) treatment, (b) a block-iterative strategy in conjunction with\nsemi-implicit (for NS) and implicit (for PNP) time integrators, and (c) octree\nbased adaptive mesh refinement. The VMS formulation provides numerical\nstabilization critical for capturing the electro-convective instabilities often\nobserved in engineered devices. The block-iterative strategy decouples the\ndifficulty of non-linear coupling between the NS and PNP equations and allows\nusing tailored numerical schemes separately for NS and PNP equations. The\ncarefully designed second-order, hybrid implicit methods circumvent the harsh\ntimestep requirements of explicit time steppers, thus enabling simulations over\nlonger time horizons. Finally, the octree-based meshing allows efficient and\ntargeted spatial resolution of the EDL.

    "title": "Rationalizing Predictions by Adversarial Information Calibration",
    "abstract": "Explaining the predictions of AI models is paramount in safety-critical\napplications, such as in legal or medical domains. One form of explanation for\na prediction is an extractive rationale, i.e., a subset of features of an\ninstance that lead the model to give its prediction on that instance. For\nexample, the subphrase ``he stole the mobile phone'' can be an extractive\nrationale for the prediction of ``Theft''. Previous works on generating\nextractive rationales usually employ a two-phase model: a selector that selects\nthe most important features (i.e., the rationale) followed by a predictor that\nmakes the prediction based exclusively on the selected features. One\ndisadvantage of these works is that the main signal for learning to select\nfeatures comes from the comparison of the answers given by the predictor to the\nground-truth answers. In this work, we propose to squeeze more information from\nthe predictor via an information calibration method. More precisely, we train\ntwo models jointly: one is a typical neural model that solves the task at hand\nin an accurate but black-box manner, and the other is a selector-predictor\nmodel that additionally produces a rationale for its prediction. The first\nmodel is used as a guide for the second model.

    "abstract": "When there are unlabeled Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data from other classes,\nSemi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods suffer from severe performance\ndegradation and even get worse than merely training on labeled data. In this\npaper, we empirically analyze Pseudo-Labeling (PL) in class-mismatched SSL. PL\nis a simple and representative SSL method that transforms SSL problems into\nsupervised learning by creating pseudo-labels for unlabeled data according to\nthe model's prediction. We aim to answer two main questions: (1) How do OOD\ndata influence PL? (2) What is the proper usage of OOD data with PL? First, we\nshow that the major problem of PL is imbalanced pseudo-labels on OOD data.\nSecond, we find that OOD data can help classify In-Distribution (ID) data given\ntheir OOD ground truth labels. Based on the findings, we propose to improve PL\nin class-mismatched SSL with two components -- Re-balanced Pseudo-Labeling\n(RPL) and Semantic Exploration Clustering (SEC). RPL re-balances pseudo-labels\nof high-confidence data, which simultaneously filters out OOD data and\naddresses the imbalance problem. SEC uses balanced clustering on low-confidence\ndata to create pseudo-labels on extra classes, simulating the process of\ntraining with ground truth. Experiments show that our method achieves steady\nimprovement over supervised baseline and state-of-the-art performance under all\nclass mismatch ratios on different benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a novel complementary learning approach to enhance\ntest-time adaptation (TTA), which has been proven to exhibit good performance\non testing data with distribution shifts such as corruptions. In test-time\nadaptation tasks, information from the source domain is typically unavailable\nand the model has to be optimized without supervision for test-time samples.\nHence, usual methods assign labels for unannotated data with the prediction by\na well-trained source model in an unsupervised learning framework. Previous\nstudies have employed unsupervised objectives, such as the entropy of model\npredictions, as optimization targets to effectively learn features for\ntest-time samples. However, the performance of the model is easily compromised\nby the quality of pseudo-labels, since inaccuracies in pseudo-labels introduce\nnoise to the model. Therefore, we propose to leverage the \"less probable\ncategories\" to decrease the risk of incorrect pseudo-labeling. The\ncomplementary label is introduced to designate these categories. We highlight\nthat the risk function of complementary labels agrees with their Vanilla loss\nformula under the conventional true label distribution. Experiments show that\nthe proposed learning algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on\ndifferent datasets and experiment settings.",

The key components of a typical regressor lie\nin the feature extraction of input views and the fusion of multi-view features.\nIn this paper, we present Pixel-aligned Feedback Fusion (PaFF) for accurate yet\nefficient human mesh recovery from multi-view images. PaFF is an iterative\nregression framework that performs feature extraction and fusion alternately.\nAt each iteration, PaFF extracts pixel-aligned feedback features from each\ninput view according to the reprojection of the current estimation and fuses\nthem together with respect to each vertex of the downsampled mesh. In this way,\nour regressor can not only perceive the misalignment status of each view from\nthe feedback features but also correct the mesh parameters more effectively\nbased on the feature fusion on mesh vertices. Additionally, our regressor\ndisentangles the global orientation and translation of the body mesh from the\nestimation of mesh parameters such that the camera parameters of input views\ncan be better utilized in the regression process.

We target two research areas of interest: Gaussian graphical\nmodels for tensor-variate data and summarization of complex time-varying texts\nusing topic models. This work advances the state-of-the-art in several\ndirections. First, it introduces a new class of tensor-variate Gaussian\ngraphical models via the Sylvester tensor equation. Second, it develops an\noptimization technique based on a fast-converging proximal alternating\nlinearized minimization method, which scales tensor-variate Gaussian graphical\nmodel estimations to modern big-data settings. Third, it connects\nKronecker-structured (inverse) covariance models with spatio-temporal partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) and introduces a new framework for ensemble\nKalman filtering that is capable of tracking chaotic physical systems. Fourth,\nit proposes a modular and interpretable framework for unsupervised and\nweakly-supervised probabilistic topic modeling of time-varying data that\ncombines generative statistical models with computational geometric methods.\nThroughout, practical applications of the methodology are considered using real\ndatasets. This includes brain-connectivity analysis using EEG data, space\nweather forecasting using solar imaging data, longitudinal analysis of public\nopinions using Twitter data, and mining of mental health related issues using\nTalkLife data.

    "abstract": "BERT-based re-ranking and dense retrieval (DR) systems have been shown to\nimprove search effectiveness for spoken content retrieval (SCR). However, both\nmethods can still show a reduction in effectiveness when using ASR transcripts\nin comparison to accurate manual transcripts. We find that a known-item search\ntask on the How2 dataset of spoken instruction videos shows a reduction in mean\nreciprocal rank (MRR) scores of 10-14%. As a potential method to reduce this\ndisparity, we investigate the use of semi-supervised ASR transcripts and N-best\nASR transcripts to mitigate ASR errors for spoken search using BERT-based\nranking. Semi-supervised ASR transcripts brought 2-5.5% MRR improvements over\nstandard ASR transcripts and our N-best early fusion methods for BERT DR\nsystems improved MRR by 3-4%. Combining semi-supervised transcripts with N-best\nearly fusion for BERT DR reduced the MRR gap in search effectiveness between\nmanual and ASR transcripts by more than 50% from 14.32% to 6.58%.",

    "abstract": "There are a plethora of methods and algorithms that solve the classical\nmulti-label document classification. However, when it comes to deployment and\nusage in an industry setting, most, if not all the contemporary approaches fail\nto address some of the vital aspects or requirements of an ideal solution: i.\nability to operate on variable-length texts and rambling documents. ii.\ncatastrophic forgetting problem. iii. modularity when it comes to online\nlearning and updating the model. iv. ability to spotlight relevant text while\nproducing the prediction, i.e. visualizing the predictions. v. ability to\noperate on imbalanced or skewed datasets. vi. scalability. The paper describes\nthe significance of these problems in detail and proposes a unique neural\nnetwork architecture that addresses the above problems. The proposed\narchitecture views documents as a sequence of sentences and leverages\nsentence-level embeddings for input representation. A hydranet-like\narchitecture is designed to have granular control over and improve the\nmodularity, coupled with a weighted loss driving task-specific heads. In\nparticular, two specific mechanisms are compared: Bi-LSTM and\nTransformer-based. The architecture is benchmarked on some of the popular\nbenchmarking datasets such as Web of Science - 5763, Web of Science - 11967,\nBBC Sports, and BBC News datasets. The experimental results reveal that the\nproposed model outperforms the existing methods by a substantial margin.

Our\napproach learns viseme dynamics from speech videos, produces animator-friendly\nviseme curves, and supports multilingual speech inputs. The core of our\napproach is a novel parametric viseme fitting algorithm that utilizes phoneme\npriors to extract viseme parameters from speech videos. With the guidance of\nphonemes, the extracted viseme curves can better correlate with phonemes, thus\nmore controllable and friendly to animators. To support multilingual speech\ninputs and generalizability to unseen voices, we take advantage of deep audio\nfeature models pretrained on multiple languages to learn the mapping from audio\nto viseme curves. Our audio-to-curves mapping achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance even when the input audio suffers from distortions of volume,\npitch, speed, or noise. Lastly, a viseme scanning approach for acquiring\nhigh-fidelity viseme assets is presented for efficient speech animation\nproduction. We show that the predicted viseme curves can be applied to\ndifferent viseme-rigged characters to yield various personalized animations\nwith realistic and natural facial motions.

At every time, each agent is randomly\ncoupled with another agent via their dynamics and one-stage cost function,\nwhere this randomization is generated via the empirical distribution of their\nstates (i.e., the mean-field term). Therefore, the transition probability and\nthe one-stage cost function of each agent depend linearly on the mean-field\nterm, which is the key distinction between classical mean-field games and\nlinear mean-field games. Under mild assumptions, we show that the policy\nobtained from infinite population equilibrium is $\\varepsilon(N)$-Nash when the\nnumber of agents $N$ is sufficiently large, where $\\varepsilon(N)$ is an\nexplicit function of $N$. Then, using the linear programming formulation of\nMDPs and the linearity of the transition probability in mean-field term, we\nformulate the game in the infinite population limit as a generalized Nash\nequilibrium problem (GNEP) and establish an algorithm for computing equilibrium\nwith a convergence guarantee.",

When we prepare a pair of raw images and\ndamage class labels, it is possible to train supervised learning toward the\npredefined damage grade, displacement.

    "abstract": "Objective: This work proposes a semi-supervised training approach for\ndetecting lung and heart sounds simultaneously with only one trained model and\nin invariance to the auscultation point. Methods: We use open-access data from\nthe 2016 Physionet/CinC Challenge, the 2022 George Moody Challenge, and from\nthe lung sound database HF_V1. We first train specialist single-task models\nusing foreground ground truth (GT) labels from different auscultation databases\nto identify background sound events in the respective lung and heart\nauscultation databases. The pseudo-labels generated in this way were combined\nwith the ground truth labels in a new training iteration, such that a new model\nwas subsequently trained to detect foreground and background signals. Benchmark\ntests ensured that the newly trained model could detect both, lung, and heart\nsound events in different auscultation sites without regressing on the original\ntask. We also established hand-validated labels for the respective background\nsignal in heart and lung sound auscultations to evaluate the models. Results:\nIn this work, we report for the first time results for i) a multi-class\nprediction for lung sound events and ii) for simultaneous detection of heart\nand lung sound events and achieve competitive results using only one model. The\ncombined multi-task model regressed slightly in heart sound detection and\ngained significantly in lung sound detection accuracy with an overall macro F1\nscore of 39.2% over six classes, representing a 6.7% improvement over the\nsingle-task baseline models. Conclusion/Significance: To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first approach developed to date for measuring heart and\nlung sound events invariant to both, the auscultation site and capturing\ndevice. Hence, our model is capable of performing lung and heart sound\ndetection from any auscultation location.",

    "abstract": "We study automated intrusion response and formulate the interaction between\nan attacker and a defender as an optimal stopping game where attack and defense\nstrategies evolve through reinforcement learning and self-play. The\ngame-theoretic modeling enables us to find defender strategies that are\neffective against a dynamic attacker, i.e. an attacker that adapts its strategy\nin response to the defender strategy. Further, the optimal stopping formulation\nallows us to prove that optimal strategies have threshold properties. To obtain\nnear-optimal defender strategies, we develop Threshold Fictitious Self-Play\n(T-FP), a fictitious self-play algorithm that learns Nash equilibria through\nstochastic approximation. We show that T-FP outperforms a state-of-the-art\nalgorithm for our use case. The experimental part of this investigation\nincludes two systems: a simulation system where defender strategies are\nincrementally learned and an emulation system where statistics are collected\nthat drive simulation runs and where learned strategies are evaluated. We argue\nthat this approach can produce effective defender strategies for a practical IT\ninfrastructure.",

    "abstract": "When allocating indivisible items to agents, it is known that the only\nstrategyproof mechanisms that satisfy a set of rather mild conditions are\nconstrained serial dictatorships: given a fixed order over agents, at each step\nthe designated agent chooses a given number of items (depending on her position\nin the sequence). With these rules, also known as non-interleaving picking\nsequences, agents who come earlier in the sequence have a larger choice of\nitems. However, this advantage can be compensated by a higher number of items\nreceived by those who come later. How to balance priority in the sequence and\nnumber of items received is a nontrivial question. We use a previous model,\nparameterized by a mapping from ranks to scores, a social welfare functional,\nand a distribution over preference profiles.

    "abstract": "With the rapid acceleration of transportation electrification, public\ncharging stations are becoming vital infrastructure in a smart sustainable city\nto provide on-demand electric vehicle (EV) charging services. As more consumers\nseek to utilize public charging services, the pricing and scheduling of such\nservices will become vital, complementary tools to mediate competition for\ncharging resources. However, determining the right prices to charge is\ndifficult due to the online nature of EV arrivals. This paper studies a joint\npricing and scheduling problem for the operator of EV charging networks with\nlimited charging capacity and time-varying energy cost. Upon receiving a\ncharging request, the operator offers a price, and the EV decides whether to\nadmit the offer based on its own value and the posted price. The operator then\nschedules the real-time charging process to satisfy the charging request if the\nEV admits the offer. We propose an online pricing algorithm that can determine\nthe posted price and EV charging schedule to maximize social welfare, i.e., the\ntotal value of EVs minus the energy cost of charging stations. Theoretically,\nwe prove the devised algorithm can achieve the order-optimal competitive ratio\nunder the competitive analysis framework. Practically, we show the empirical\nperformance of our algorithm outperforms other benchmark algorithms in\nexperiments using real EV charging data.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a unified gas-kinetic particle (UGKP) method for the\nfrequency-dependent photon transport process. The photon transport is a typical\nmultiscale process governed by the nonlinear radiative transfer equations\n(RTE). The flow regime of photon transport varies from the ballistic regime to\nthe diffusive regime with respect to optical depth and photon frequency. The\nUGKP method is an asymptotic preserving (AP) scheme and a regime adaptive\nscheme. The teleportation error is significantly reduced, and the computational\nefficiency is remarkably improved in the diffusive regime. Distinguished from\nthe standard multigroup treatment, the proposed UGKP method solves the\nfrequency space in a non-discretized way. Therefore the Rosseland diffusion\nsystem can be precisely preserved in the optically thick regime. Taking\nadvantage of the local integral solution of RTE, the distribution of the\nemitted photon can be constructed from its macroscopic moments. The Monte Carlo\nparticles in the UGKP method need only be tracked before their first collision\nevents, and a re-sampling process is performed to close the photon distribution\nfor each time step. The large computational cost of excessive scattering events\ncan be saved, especially in the optically thick regime. The proposed UGKP\nmethod is implicit and removes the light speed constraint on the time step. The\nparticle tracking approach combining the implicit formulation makes the\nproposed UGKP method an efficient solution algorithm for frequency-dependent\nradiative transfer problems. We demonstrate with numerical examples the\ncapability of the proposed multi-frequency UGKP method.",

    "abstract": "The goal of image ordinal estimation is to estimate the ordinal label of a\ngiven image with a convolutional neural network. Existing methods are mainly\nbased on ordinal regression and particularly focus on modeling the ordinal\nmapping from the feature representation of the input to the ordinal label\nspace. However, the manifold of the resultant feature representations does not\nmaintain the intrinsic ordinal relations of interest, which hinders the\neffectiveness of the image ordinal estimation. Therefore, this paper proposes\nlearning intrinsic Consistent Ordinal REpresentations (CORE) from ordinal\nrelations residing in groundtruth labels while encouraging the feature\nrepresentations to embody the ordinal low-dimensional manifold. First, we\ndevelop an ordinal totally ordered set (toset) distribution (OTD), which can\n(i) model the label embeddings to inherit ordinal information and measure\ndistances between ordered labels of samples in a neighborhood, and (ii) model\nthe feature embeddings to infer numerical magnitude with unknown ordinal\ninformation among the features of different samples. Second, through OTD, we\nconvert the feature representations and labels into the same embedding space\nfor better alignment, and then compute the Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence\nbetween the ordinal labels and feature representations to endow the latent\nspace with consistent ordinal relations. Third, we optimize the KL divergence\nthrough ordinal prototype-constrained convex programming with dual\ndecomposition; our theoretical analysis shows that we can obtain the optimal\nsolutions via gradient backpropagation. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed CORE can accurately construct an ordinal latent\nspace and significantly enhance existing deep ordinal regression methods to\nachieve better results.",

Previous studies on finetuning focused on adapting only the weights\nof a task-specific classifier or re-optimizing all layers of the pre-trained\nmodel using the new task data. The first type of methods cannot mitigate the\nmismatch between a pre-trained model and the new task data, and the second type\nof methods easily cause over-fitting when processing tasks with limited data.\nTo explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning, we propose a novel block-wise\noptimization mechanism, which adapts the weights of a group of layers of a\npre-trained model. In our work, the layer selection can be done in four\ndifferent ways. The first is layer-wise adaptation, which aims to search for\nthe most salient single layer according to the classification performance. The\nsecond way is based on the first one, jointly adapting a small number of\ntop-ranked layers instead of using an individual layer. The third is block\nbased segmentation, where the layers of a deep network is segmented into blocks\nby non-weighting layers, such as the MaxPooling layer and Activation layer. The\nlast one is to use a fixed-length sliding window to group layers block by\nblock. To identify which group of layers is the most suitable for finetuning,\nthe search starts from the target end and is conducted by freezing other layers\nexcluding the selected layers and the classification layers. The most salient\ngroup of layers is determined in terms of classification performance. In our\nexperiments, the proposed approaches are tested on an often-used dataset,\nTf_flower, by finetuning five typical pre-trained models, VGG16, MobileNet-v1,\nMobileNet-v2, MobileNet-v3, and ResNet50v2, respectively.

We exploit the expressive power of neural networks as novel templates\nfor indicating supermartingale functions, which provide general certificates of\nreachability that are both tight and sound.

Because the common workflow is to use a back-facing camera to\ncapture the physical world for overlaying virtual objects, we refer to this\nusage pattern as back-facing AR. However, existing methods often fall short in\nsupporting emerging front-facing mobile AR applications, e.g., virtual try-on\nwhere a user leverages a front-facing camera to explore the effect of various\nproducts (e.g., glasses or hats) of different styles. This lack of support can\nbe attributed to the unique challenges of obtaining 360$^\\circ$ HDR environment\nmaps, an ideal format of lighting representation, from the front-facing camera\nand existing techniques. In this paper, we propose to leverage dual-camera\nstreaming to generate a high-quality environment map by combining multi-view\nlighting reconstruction and parametric directional lighting estimation. Our\npreliminary results show improved rendering quality using a dual-camera setup\nfor front-facing AR compared to a commercial solution.",

    "abstract": "We investigate a transmitter-receiver pair in a slotted-time system. The\ntransmitter observes a dynamic source and sends updates to a remote receiver\nthrough a communication channel. We assume that the channel is error-free but\nsuffers a random delay. We consider two more practical cases to facilitate the\nanalysis. In the first case, the update is guaranteed to be delivered within a\ncertain number of time slots. In the second case, once the transmission time\nexceeds a predetermined value, the update is immediately discarded, leaving the\nchannel free for a new transmission on demand. The receiver will maintain an\nestimate of the current state of the dynamic source using the received updates.\nIn this paper, we adopt the Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) as the\nperformance metric and investigate the problem of optimizing the transmitter's\naction in each time slot to minimize AoII. We first characterize the\noptimization problem using the Markov decision process and investigate the\nperformance of the threshold policy, under which the transmitter transmits\nupdates only when the AoII exceeds the threshold $\\tau$. By delving into the\ncharacteristics of the system evolution, we precisely compute the expected AoII\nachieved by the threshold policy using the Markov chain. Then, we prove that\nthe optimal policy exists and provide a computable relative value iteration\nalgorithm to estimate the optimal policy. Next, by leveraging the policy\nimprovement theorem, we prove that, under an easy-to-verify condition, the\noptimal policy is the threshold policy with $\\tau=1$. Finally, numerical\nresults are laid out to highlight the performance of the optimal policy.",

    "title": "Cooperative Concurrent Games",
    "abstract": "In rational verification, the aim is to verify which temporal logic\nproperties will obtain in a multi-agent system, under the assumption that\nagents (\"players\") in the system choose strategies for acting that form a game\ntheoretic equilibrium. Preferences are typically defined by assuming that\nagents act in pursuit of individual goals, specified as temporal logic\nformulae. To date, rational verification has been studied using non-cooperative\nsolution concepts - Nash equilibrium and refinements thereof. Such\nnon-cooperative solution concepts assume that there is no possibility of agents\nforming binding agreements to cooperate, and as such they are restricted in\ntheir applicability. In this article, we extend rational verification to\ncooperative solution concepts, as studied in the field of cooperative game\ntheory. We focus on the core, as this is the most fundamental (and most widely\nstudied) cooperative solution concept. We begin by presenting a variant of the\ncore that seems well-suited to the concurrent game setting, and we show that\nthis version of the core can be characterised using ATL*. We then study the\ncomputational complexity of key decision problems associated with the core,\nwhich range from problems in PSPACE to problems in 3EXPTIME. We also\ninvestigate conditions that are sufficient to ensure that the core is\nnon-empty, and explore when it is invariant under bisimilarity. We then\nintroduce and study a number of variants of the main definition of the core,\nleading to the issue of credible deviations, and to stronger notions of\ncollective stable behaviour. Finally, we study cooperative rational\nverification using an alternative model of preferences, in which players seek\nto maximise the mean-payoff they obtain over an infinite play in games where\nquantitative information is allowed.",

Despite the large\nnumber of methods that have been put forth to extract the main topics of texts,\na limited number of studies have probed the impact of the text length on the\nperformance of keyword extraction (KE) methods. In this study, we adopted a\nnetwork-based approach to evaluate whether keywords extracted from paper\nabstracts are compatible with keywords extracted from full papers. We employed\na community detection method to identify groups of related papers in citation\nnetworks. These paper clusters were then employed to extract keywords from\nabstracts. Our results indicate that while the various community detection\nmethods employed in our KE approach yielded similar levels of accuracy, a\ncorrelation analysis revealed that these methods produced distinct keyword\nlists for each abstract. We also observed that all considered approaches,\nhowever, reach low values of accuracy. Surprisingly, text clustering approaches\noutperformed all citation-based methods. The findings suggest that using\ndifferent sources of information to extract keywords can lead to significant\ndifferences in performance.

The SARS is a special police unit under the Nigeria Police Force tasked\nwith the responsibility of fighting violent crimes. However, the unit has been\naccused of waves of human rights abuse across the nation. According to a report\nby Amnesty International, between January 2017 and May 2020, 82 cases of police\nbrutality have been committed.

The #EndSARS hashtag was widely used by\nthe protesters to amplify their messages and reach out to wider communities on\nTwitter.

We found that the\nmobilisation strategies include direct and indirect engagements with\ninfluential users, sharing direct stories and vicarious experiences. Also,\nthere is evidence that suggests the deployment of automated accounts to promote\nthe course of the protest. In terms of participation, over 70% of the protest\nis confined within a few states in Nigeria, and the diaspora communities also\nlent their voices to the movement. The most active users are not those with\nhigh followership, and the majority of the protesters utilised mobile devices,\naccounting for 88% to mobilise and report on the protest. We also examined how\nsocial media users interact with the movement and the response from the wider\nonline communities.

    "abstract": "Increasing the number of cyclists, whether for general transport or\nrecreation, can provide health improvements and reduce the environmental impact\nof vehicular transportation. However, the public's perception of cycling may be\ndriven by the ideologies and reporting standards of news agencies. For\ninstance, people may identify cyclists on the road as \"dangerous\" if news\nagencies overly report cycling accidents, limiting the number of people that\ncycle for transportation. Moreover, if fewer people cycle, there may be less\nfunding from the government to invest in safe infrastructure. In this paper, we\nexplore the perceived perception of cyclists within news headlines. To\naccomplish this, we introduce a new dataset, \"Bike Frames\", that can help\nprovide insight into how headlines portray cyclists and help detect\naccident-related headlines. Next, we introduce a multi-task (MT) regularization\napproach that increases the detection accuracy of accident-related posts,\ndemonstrating improvements over traditional MT frameworks. Finally, we compare\nand contrast the perceptions of cyclists with motorcyclist-related headlines to\nground the findings with another related activity for both male- and\nfemale-related posts. Our findings show that general news websites are more\nlikely to report accidents about cyclists than other events. Moreover,\ncyclist-specific websites are more likely to report about accidents than\nmotorcycling-specific websites, even though there is more potential danger for\nmotorcyclists. Finally, we show substantial differences in the reporting about\nmale vs. female-related persons, e.g., more male-related cyclists headlines are\nrelated to accidents, but more female-related motorcycling headlines about\naccidents.

Methods: A Multi-Processor\nSystem-On-Chip (MPSoC) composed of Central Processor Unit (CPU) and\nField-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is proposed for increasing the security\nand the frame rate of a smart IoT edge device. The private encryption key is\nsafely embedded in the FPGA unit to avoid being exposed in the Random Access\nMemory (RAM). This allows the edge device to securely store and authenticate\nthe key, protecting the data transmitted from the same Integrated Circuit (IC).\nAdditionally, the edge device can simultaneously publish and route a camera\nstream using a lightweight communication protocol, achieving a frame rate of 14\nframes per Second (fps). The performance of the MPSoC is compared to a NVIDIA\nJetson Nano (NJN) and a Raspberry Pi 4 (RPI4) and it is found that the RPI4 is\nthe most cost-effective solution but with lower frame rate, the NJN is the\nfastest because it can achieve higher frame-rate but it is not secure, and the\nMPSoC is the optimal solution because it offers a balanced frame rate and it is\nsecure because it never exposes the secure key into the memory. Results: The\nproposed system successfully addresses the challenges of security, scalability,\nand efficiency in an IoT system used for surveillance and monitoring. The\nencryption key is securely stored and authenticated, and the edge device is\nable to simultaneously publish and route a camera stream feed high-definition\nimages at 14 fps.",

    "title": "Early Detection for Multiversion Concurrency Control Conflicts in  Hyperledger Fabric",
    "abstract": "Hyperledger Fabric is a popular permissioned blockchain system that features\na highly modular and extensible system for deploying permissioned blockchains\nwhich are expected to have a major effect on a wide range of sectors. Unlike\ntraditional blockchain systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric\nuses the EOV model for transaction processing: the submitted transactions are\nexecuted by the endorsing peer, ordered and batched by the ordering services,\nand validated by the validating peers. Due to this EOV workflow, a\nwell-documented issue that arises is the multi-version concurrency control\nconflict. This happens when two transactions try to writes and read the same\nkey in the ledger at the same time. Existing solutions to address this problem\nincludes eliminating blocks in favor of streaming transactions, repairing\nconflicts during the ordering phase, and automatically merging the conflicting\ntransactions using CRDT (Conflict Free Replicated Data) techniques. In this\npaper, we propose a novel solution called Early Detection for MVCC Conflicts.\nOur solution detects the conflicting transactions at an early stage of the\ntransaction execution instead of processing them until the validation phase to\nbe aborted. The advantage of our solution is that it detects conflict as soon\nas possible to minimize the overhead of conflicting transaction on the network\nresulting in the reduction of the end-to-end transaction latency and the\nincrease of the system's effective throughput. We have successfully implemented\nour solution in Hyperledger Fabric. We propose three different implementations\nwhich realize early detection. Our results show that our solutions all perform\nbetter than the baseline Fabric, with our best solution SyncMap which improves\nthe goodput by up to 23% and reduces the latency by up to 80%.",

    "abstract": "An accurate understanding of omnidirectional environment lighting is crucial\nfor high-quality virtual object rendering in mobile augmented reality (AR). In\nparticular, to support reflective rendering, existing methods have leveraged\ndeep learning models to estimate or have used physical light probes to capture\nphysical lighting, typically represented in the form of an environment map.\nHowever, these methods often fail to provide visually coherent details or\nrequire additional setups. For example, the commercial framework ARKit uses a\nconvolutional neural network that can generate realistic environment maps;\nhowever the corresponding reflective rendering might not match the physical\nenvironments. In this work, we present the design and implementation of a\nlighting reconstruction framework called LitAR that enables realistic and\nvisually-coherent rendering. LitAR addresses several challenges of supporting\nlighting information for mobile AR. First, to address the spatial variance\nproblem, LitAR uses two-field lighting reconstruction to divide the lighting\nreconstruction task into the spatial variance-aware near-field reconstruction\nand the directional-aware far-field reconstruction. The corresponding\nenvironment map allows reflective rendering with correct color tones. Second,\nLitAR uses two noise-tolerant data capturing policies to ensure data quality,\nnamely guided bootstrapped movement and motion-based automatic capturing.\nThird, to handle the mismatch between the mobile computation capability and the\nhigh computation requirement of lighting reconstruction, LitAR employs two\nnovel real-time environment map rendering techniques called multi-resolution\nprojection and anchor extrapolation. These two techniques effectively remove\nthe need of time-consuming mesh reconstruction while maintaining visual\nquality.",

Deep learning\nmodels for human action recognition have progressed significantly over the last\ndecade. Recently, there is an increased interest in research that incorporates\ndeep learning-based action recognition for animal behavior classification.\nHowever, human action recognition methods are more developed. This survey\npresents an overview of human action recognition and pose estimation methods\nthat are based on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and have\nbeen adapted for animal behavior classification in neuroscience. Pose\nestimation, estimating joint positions from an image frame, is included because\nit is often applied before classifying animal behavior. First, we provide\nfoundational information on algorithms that learn spatiotemporal features\nthrough 2D, two-stream, and 3D CNNs. We explore motivating factors that\ndetermine optimizers, loss functions and training procedures, and compare their\nperformance on benchmark datasets. Next, we review animal behavior frameworks\nthat use or build upon these methods, organized by the level of supervision\nthey require. Our discussion is uniquely focused on the technical evolution of\nthe underlying CNN models and their architectural adaptations (which we\nillustrate), rather than their usability in a neuroscience lab.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the\nstandard class of deep neural network for image processing, classification and\nsegmentation tasks. However, the large strides in accuracy obtained by CNNs\nhave been derived from increasing the complexity of network topologies, which\nincurs sizeable performance and energy penalties in the training and inference\nof CNNs. Many recent works have validated the effectiveness of parameter\nquantization, which consists in reducing the bit width of the network's\nparameters, to enable the attainment of considerable performance and energy\nefficiency gains without significantly compromising accuracy. However, it is\ndifficult to compare the relative effectiveness of different quantization\nmethods. To address this problem, we introduce RedBit, an open-source framework\nthat provides a transparent, extensible and easy-to-use interface to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of different algorithms and parameter configurations on\nnetwork accuracy. We use RedBit to perform a comprehensive survey of five\nstate-of-the-art quantization methods applied to the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and\nImageNet datasets. We evaluate a total of 2300 individual bit width\ncombinations, independently tuning the width of the network's weight and input\nactivation parameters, from 32 bits down to 1 bit (e.g., 8/8, 2/2, 1/32, 1/1,\nfor weights/activations). Upwards of 20000 hours of computing time in a pool of\nstate-of-the-art GPUs were used to generate all the results in this paper. For\n1-bit quantization, the accuracy losses for the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet\ndatasets range between [0.26%, 0.79%], [9.74%, 32.96%] and [10.86%, 47.36%]\ntop-1, respectively.

However, most learning results are limited in interpretability\nand generalization over different computational grid resolutions, initial and\nboundary conditions, domain geometries, and physical or problem-specific\nparameters. In the present study, we simultaneously address all these\nchallenges by developing the novel and versatile methodology of unified neural\npartial delay differential equations. We augment existing/low-fidelity\ndynamical models directly in their partial differential equation (PDE) forms\nwith both Markovian and non-Markovian neural network (NN) closure\nparameterizations. The melding of the existing models with NNs in the\ncontinuous spatiotemporal space followed by numerical discretization\nautomatically allows for the desired generalizability. The Markovian term is\ndesigned to enable extraction of its analytical form and thus provides\ninterpretability. The non-Markovian terms allow accounting for inherently\nmissing time delays needed to represent the real world. We obtain adjoint PDEs\nin the continuous form, thus enabling direct implementation across\ndifferentiable and non-differentiable computational physics codes, different ML\nframeworks, and treatment of nonuniformly-spaced spatiotemporal training data.\nWe demonstrate the new generalized neural closure models (gnCMs) framework\nusing four sets of experiments based on advecting nonlinear waves, shocks, and\nocean acidification models.

    "abstract": "Human cognition model could help us gain insights in how human cognition\nbehaviors work under external stimuli, pave the way for synthetic data\ngeneration, and assist in adaptive intervention design for cognition\nregulation. When the external stimuli is highly dynamic, it becomes hard to\nmodel the effect that how the stimuli influences human cognition behaviors.\nHere we propose a novel hybrid deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework\nintegrating drift-diffusion model to simulate the effect of dynamic time\npressure on human cognition performance. We start with a N=50 user study to\ninvestigate how different factors may affect human performance, which help us\ngain prior knowledge in framework design. The evaluation demonstrates that this\nframework could improve human cognition modeling quantitatively and capture the\ngeneral trend of human cognition behaviors qualitatively.

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can potentially combat jamming\nattacks by diffusing jamming signals. This paper jointly optimizes user\nselection, channel allocation, modulation-coding, and RIS configuration in a\nmultiuser OFDMA system under a jamming attack. This problem is non-trivial and\nhas never been addressed, because of its mixed-integer programming nature and\ndifficulties in acquiring channel state information (CSI) involving the RIS and\njammer. We propose a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach,\nwhich learns only through changes in the received data rates of the users to\nreject the jamming signals and maximize the sum rate of the system. The key\nidea is that we decouple the discrete selection of users, channels, and\nmodulation-coding from the continuous RIS configuration, hence facilitating the\nRIS configuration with the latest twin delayed deep deterministic policy\ngradient (TD3) model. Another important aspect is that we show a\nwinner-takes-all strategy is almost surely optimal for selecting the users,\nchannels, and modulation-coding, given a learned RIS configuration. Simulations\nshow that the new approach converges fast to fulfill the benefit of the RIS,\ndue to its substantially small state and action spaces.

    "abstract": "It is an open problem to control the interaction forces of lower-limb\nexoskeletons designed for unrestricted overground walking, i.e., floating base\nexoskeletons with feet that contact the ground. For these types of\nexoskeletons, it is challenging to measure interaction forces as it is not\nfeasible to implement force/torque sensors at every contact between the user\nand the exoskeleton. Moreover, it is important to compensate for the\nexoskeleton's whole-body gravitational and dynamical forces. Previous works\neither simplified the dynamic model by treating the legs as independent double\npendulums, or they did not close the loop with interaction force feedback.\nThis paper presents a novel method to calculate interaction torques during\nthe complete gait cycle by using whole-body dynamics and joint torque\nmeasurements on a hip-knee exoskeleton. Furthermore, we propose a constrained\noptimization scheme combined with a virtual model controller to track desired\ninteraction torques in a closed loop while considering physical limits and\nsafety considerations. Together, we call this approach whole-exoskeleton\nclosed-loop compensation (WECC) control. We evaluated the haptic transparency\nand spring-damper rendering performance of WECC control on three subjects. We\nalso compared the performance of WECC with a controller based on a simplified\ndynamic model and a passive version of the exoskeleton with disassembled\ndrives. The WECC controller resulted in consistent interaction torque tracking\nduring the whole gait cycle for both zero and nonzero desired interaction\ntorques. On the contrary, the simplified controller failed to track desired\ninteraction torques during the stance phase. The proposed interaction force\ncontrol method is especially beneficial for heavy lower-limb exoskeletons where\nthe dynamics of the entire exoskeleton should be compensated.",

To lower the complexity of our decoding algorithm, referred to\nas subRPA, we investigate different approaches to prune the projections. Next,\nwe derive the soft-decision based version of our algorithm, called soft-subRPA,\nthat not only improves upon the performance of subRPA but also enables a\ndifferentiable decoding algorithm. Building upon the soft-subRPA algorithm, we\nthen provide a framework for training a machine learning (ML) model to search\nfor \\textit{good} sets of projections that minimize the decoding error rate.\nTraining our ML model enables achieving very close to the performance of\nfull-projection decoding with a significantly smaller number of projections.

    "abstract": "As one of the most popular GNN architectures, the graph attention networks\n(GAT) is considered the most advanced learning architecture for graph\nrepresentation and has been widely used in various graph mining tasks with\nimpressive results. However, since GAT was proposed, none of the existing\nstudies have provided systematic insight into the relationship between the\nperformance of GAT and the number of layers, which is a critical issue in\nguiding model performance improvement. In this paper, we perform a systematic\nexperimental evaluation and based on the experimental results, we find two\nimportant facts: (1) the main factor limiting the accuracy of the GAT model as\nthe number of layers increases is the oversquashing phenomenon; (2) among the\nprevious improvements applied to the GNN model, only the residual connection\ncan significantly improve the GAT model performance. We combine these two\nimportant findings to provide a theoretical explanation that it is the residual\nconnection that mitigates the loss of original feature information due to\noversquashing and thus improves the deep GAT model performance. This provides\nempirical insights and guidelines for researchers to design the GAT variant\nmodel with appropriate depth and well performance. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed guidelines, we propose a GAT variant model-ADGAT\nthat adaptively selects the number of layers based on the sparsity of the\ngraph, and experimentally demonstrate that the effectiveness of our model is\nsignificantly improved over the original GAT.",

However, the lack of high-quality benchmark\ndataset with task-specific accurate annotations for photon-limited\nimages/videos delays the research progress heavily. In this paper, we\ncontribute the first multi-illuminance, multi-camera, and low-light dataset,\nnamed DarkVision, serving for both image enhancement and object detection. We\nprovide bright and dark pairs with pixel-wise registration, in which the bright\ncounterpart provides reliable reference for restoration and annotation. The\ndataset consists of bright-dark pairs of 900 static scenes with objects from 15\ncategories, and 32 dynamic scenes with 4-category objects. For each scene,\nimages/videos were captured at 5 illuminance levels using three cameras of\ndifferent grades, and average photons can be reliably estimated from the\ncalibration data for quantitative studies. The static-scene images and dynamic\nvideos respectively contain around 7,344 and 320,667 instances in total. With\nDarkVision, we established baselines for image/video enhancement and object\ndetection by representative algorithms. To demonstrate an exemplary application\nof DarkVision, we propose two simple yet effective approaches for improving\nperformance in video enhancement and object detection respectively. We believe\nDarkVision would advance the state-of-the-arts in both imaging and related\ncomputer vision tasks in low-light environment.",

    "abstract": "We first adopt a human-guided machine learning framework to develop a new\ndataset for hyperpartisan news title detection with 2,200 manually labeled and\n1.8 million machine-labeled titles that were posted from 2014 to the present by\nnine representative media organizations across three media bias groups - Left,\nCentral, and Right in an active learning manner. The fine-tuned\ntransformer-based language model achieves an overall accuracy of 0.84 and an F1\nscore of 0.78 on an external validation set. Next, we conduct a computational\nanalysis to quantify the extent and dynamics of partisanship in news titles.\nWhile some aspects are as expected, our study reveals new or nuanced\ndifferences between the three media groups. We find that overall the Right\nmedia tends to use proportionally more hyperpartisan titles. Roughly around the\n2016 Presidential Election, the proportions of hyperpartisan titles increased\nin all media bias groups where the relative increase in the proportion of\nhyperpartisan titles of the Left media was the most. We identify three major\ntopics including foreign issues, political systems, and societal issues that\nare suggestive of hyperpartisanship in news titles using logistic regression\nmodels and the Shapley values. Through an analysis of the topic distribution,\nwe find that societal issues gradually receive more attention from all media\ngroups. We further apply a lexicon-based language analysis tool to the titles\nof each topic and quantify the linguistic distance between any pairs of the\nthree media groups. Three distinct patterns are discovered. The Left media is\nlinguistically more different from Central and Right in terms of foreign\nissues. The linguistic distance between the three media groups becomes smaller\nover recent years. In addition, a seasonal pattern where linguistic difference\nis associated with elections is observed for societal issues.",

    "abstract": "We study the effect of baselines in on-policy stochastic policy gradient\noptimization, and close the gap between the theory and practice of policy\noptimization methods. Our first contribution is to show that the \\emph{state\nvalue} baseline allows on-policy stochastic \\emph{natural} policy gradient\n(NPG) to converge to a globally optimal policy at an $O(1/t)$ rate, which was\nnot previously known. The analysis relies on two novel findings: the expected\nprogress of the NPG update satisfies a stochastic version of the non-uniform\n\\L{}ojasiewicz (N\\L{}) inequality, and with probability 1 the state value\nbaseline prevents the optimal action's probability from vanishing, thus\nensuring sufficient exploration. Importantly, these results provide a new\nunderstanding of the role of baselines in stochastic policy gradient: by\nshowing that the variance of natural policy gradient estimates remains\nunbounded with or without a baseline, we find that variance reduction\n\\emph{cannot} explain their utility in this setting. Instead, the analysis\nreveals that the primary effect of the value baseline is to \\textbf{reduce the\naggressiveness of the updates} rather than their variance. That is, we\ndemonstrate that a finite variance is \\emph{not necessary} for almost sure\nconvergence of stochastic NPG, while controlling update aggressiveness is both\nnecessary and sufficient.

    "abstract": "As a practical alternative of speech separation, target speaker extraction\n(TSE) aims to extract the speech from the desired speaker using additional\nspeaker cue extracted from the speaker. Its main challenge lies in how to\nproperly extract and leverage the speaker cue to benefit the extracted speech\nquality. The cue extraction method adopted in majority existing TSE studies is\nto directly utilize discriminative speaker embedding, which is extracted from\nthe pre-trained models for speaker verification. Although the high speaker\ndiscriminability is a most desirable property for speaker verification task, we\nargue that it may be too sophisticated for TSE. In this study, we propose that\na simplified speaker cue with clear class separability might be preferred for\nTSE. To verify our proposal, we introduce several forms of speaker cues,\nincluding naive speaker embedding (such as, x-vector and xi-vector) and new\nspeaker embeddings produced from sparse LDA-transform. Corresponding TSE models\nare built by integrating these speaker cues with SepFormer (one SOTA speech\nseparation model). Performances of these TSE models are examined on the\nbenchmark WSJ0-2mix dataset. Experimental results validate the effectiveness\nand generalizability of our proposal, showing up to 9.9% relative improvement\nin SI-SDRi. Moreover, with SI-SDRi of 19.4 dB and PESQ of 3.78, our best TSE\nsystem significantly outperforms the current SOTA systems and offers the top\nTSE results reported till date on the WSJ0-2mix.",

    "abstract": "One-shot video-driven talking face generation aims at producing a synthetic\ntalking video by transferring the facial motion from a video to an arbitrary\nportrait image. Head pose and facial expression are always entangled in facial\nmotion and transferred simultaneously. However, the entanglement sets up a\nbarrier for these methods to be used in video portrait editing directly, where\nit may require to modify the expression only while maintaining the pose\nunchanged. One challenge of decoupling pose and expression is the lack of\npaired data, such as the same pose but different expressions. Only a few\nmethods attempt to tackle this challenge with the feat of 3D Morphable Models\n(3DMMs) for explicit disentanglement. But 3DMMs are not accurate enough to\ncapture facial details due to the limited number of Blenshapes, which has side\neffects on motion transfer. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-supervised\ndisentanglement framework to decouple pose and expression without 3DMMs and\npaired data, which consists of a motion editing module, a pose generator, and\nan expression generator. The editing module projects faces into a latent space\nwhere pose motion and expression motion can be disentangled, and the pose or\nexpression transfer can be performed in the latent space conveniently via\naddition. The two generators render the modified latent codes to images,\nrespectively. Moreover, to guarantee the disentanglement, we propose a\nbidirectional cyclic training strategy with well-designed constraints.\nEvaluations demonstrate our method can control pose or expression independently\nand be used for general video editing.",

Novelty adaptation is an\nagent's ability to improve its policy performance post-novelty. Most\nreinforcement learning (RL) methods assume that the world is a closed, fixed\nprocess. Consequentially, RL policies adapt inefficiently to novelties. To\naddress this, we introduce WorldCloner, an end-to-end trainable neuro-symbolic\nworld model for rapid novelty adaptation. WorldCloner learns an efficient\nsymbolic representation of the pre-novelty environment transitions, and uses\nthis transition model to detect novelty and efficiently adapt to novelty in a\nsingle-shot fashion. Additionally, WorldCloner augments the policy learning\nprocess using imagination-based adaptation, where the world model simulates\ntransitions of the post-novelty environment to help the policy adapt. By\nblending ''imagined'' transitions with interactions in the post-novelty\nenvironment, performance can be recovered with fewer total environment\ninteractions. Using environments designed for studying novelty in sequential\ndecision-making problems, we show that the symbolic world model helps its\nneural policy adapt more efficiently than model-based and model-based\nneural-only reinforcement learning methods.",

    "abstract": "Although existing neural network approaches have achieved great success on\nChinese spelling correction, there is still room to improve. The model is\nrequired to avoid over-correction and to distinguish a correct token from its\nphonological and visually similar ones. In this paper, we propose an\nerror-guided correction model (EGCM) to improve Chinese spelling correction. By\nborrowing the powerful ability of BERT, we propose a novel zero-shot error\ndetection method to do a preliminary detection, which guides our model to\nattend more on the probably wrong tokens in encoding and to avoid modifying the\ncorrect tokens in generating. Furthermore, we introduce a new loss function to\nintegrate the error confusion set, which enables our model to distinguish\neasily misused tokens. Moreover, our model supports highly parallel decoding to\nmeet real application requirements. Experiments are conducted on widely used\nbenchmarks. Our model achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art\napproaches by a remarkable margin, on both the correction quality and\ncomputation speed.",

    "abstract": "Traditional tabular classifiers provide explainable decision-making with\ninterpretable features(concepts). However, using their explainability in vision\ntasks has been limited due to the pixel representation of images. In this\npaper, we design Img2Tabs that classify images by concepts to harness the\nexplainability of tabular classifiers. Img2Tabs encode image pixels into\ntabular features by StyleGAN inversion. Since not all of the resulting features\nare class-relevant or interpretable due to their generative nature, we expect\nImg2Tab classifiers to discover class-relevant concepts automatically from the\nStyleGAN features. Thus, we propose a novel method using the Wasserstein-1\nmetric to quantify class-relevancy and interpretability simultaneously. Using\nthis method, we investigate whether important features extracted by tabular\nclassifiers are class-relevant concepts. Consequently, we determine the most\neffective classifier for Img2Tabs in terms of discovering class-relevant\nconcepts automatically from StyleGAN features. In evaluations, we demonstrate\nconcept-based explanations through importance and visualization. Img2Tab\nachieves top-1 accuracy that is on par with CNN classifiers and deep feature\nlearning baselines. Additionally, we show that users can easily debug Img2Tab\nclassifiers at the concept level to ensure unbiased and fair decision-making\nwithout sacrificing accuracy.",

The current literature contains an\narray of approaches to estimate TD principal, however, only a few of them focus\nspecifically on architectural TD, and none of these are fully automated, freely\navailable, and thoroughly validated. Moreover, a recent study has shown that\nmany of the current approaches suffer from certain shortcomings, such as\nrelying on hand-picked thresholds.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach to estimate architectural\ntechnical debt principal based on machine learning and architectural smells to\naddress such shortcomings. Our approach can estimate the amount of technical\ndebt principal generated by a single architectural smell instance. To do so, we\nadopt novel techniques from Information Retrieval to train a learning-to-rank\nmachine learning model that estimates the severity of an architectural smell\nand ensure the transparency of the predictions. Then, for each instance, we\nstatically analyse the source code to calculate the exact number of lines of\ncode creating the smell. Finally, we combine these two values to calculate the\ntechnical debt principal.\nTo validate the approach, we conducted a case study and interviewed 16\npractitioners, from both open source and industry, and asked them about their\nopinions on the TD principal estimations for several smells detected in their\nprojects. The results show that for 71\\% of instances, practitioners agreed\nthat the estimations provided were \\emph{representative} of the effort\nnecessary to refactor the smell.",

In multi-hop UAV\nnetworks, the successful transmission of these tasks to the edge is severely\nchallenged due to severe bandwidth constraints. For this reason, we propose a\nnovel A$^2$-UAV framework to optimize the number of correctly executed tasks at\nthe edge. In stark contrast with existing art, we take an application-aware\napproach and formulate a novel pplication-Aware Task Planning Problem\n(A$^2$-TPP) that takes into account (i) the relationship between deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) accuracy and image compression for the classes of interest based\non the available dataset, (ii) the target positions, (iii) the current\nenergy/position of the UAVs to optimize routing, data pre-processing and target\nassignment for each UAV. We demonstrate A$^2$-TPP is NP-Hard and propose a\npolynomial-time algorithm to solve it efficiently. We extensively evaluate\nA$^2$-UAV through real-world experiments with a testbed composed by four DJI\nMavic Air 2 UAVs. We consider state-of-the-art image classification tasks with\nfour different DNN models (i.e., DenseNet, ResNet152, ResNet50 and\nMobileNet-V2) and object detection tasks using YoloV4 trained on the ImageNet\ndataset. Results show that A$^2$-UAV attains on average around 38% more\naccomplished tasks than the state-of-the-art, with 400% more accomplished tasks\nwhen the number of targets increases significantly.

Method: A\nsystematic literature review was performed by extending our previous review\nseries to draw a comprehensive understanding of the metrics for process\nmodeling following a meta-model of ontology of metrics in SPS. Results: We\nidentified 145 process modeling studies that collectively involve 2130 metrics\nand classified them using the coding technique. Two diagrams which illustrate\nthe high frequency causal relationships used between metrics are proposed in\nterms of two hierarchical levels of modeling purposes. We revisited the data\nissues encountered in SPS data preparing phases, as well as identified the\ncorresponding strategies. Conclusion: The results of this study provide process\nmodelers with an evidence-based reference of the identification and the use of\nmetrics in SPS modeling, and further contribute to the development of the body\nof knowledge on software metrics in the context of process modeling.\nFurthermore, this study is not limited to process simulation but can be\nextended to software process modeling, in general. Taking simulation metrics as\nstandards and references can further motivate and guide software developers to\nimprove the collection, governance, and application of process data in\npractice.",

    "abstract": "Light field (LF) camera captures rich information from a scene. Using the\ninformation, the LF de-occlusion (LF-DeOcc) task aims to reconstruct the\nocclusion-free center view image. Existing LF-DeOcc studies mainly focus on the\nsparsely sampled (sparse) LF images where most of the occluded regions are\nvisible in other views due to the large disparity. In this paper, we expand\nLF-DeOcc in more challenging datasets, densely sampled (dense) LF images, which\nare taken by a micro-lens-based portable LF camera. Due to the small disparity\nranges of dense LF images, most of the background regions are invisible in any\nview. To apply LF-DeOcc in both LF datasets, we propose a framework, ISTY,\nwhich is defined and divided into three roles: (1) extract LF features, (2)\ndefine the occlusion, and (3) inpaint occluded regions. By dividing the\nframework into three specialized components according to the roles, the\ndevelopment and analysis can be easier. Furthermore, an explainable\nintermediate representation, an occlusion mask, can be obtained in the proposed\nframework. The occlusion mask is useful for comprehensive analysis of the model\nand other applications by manipulating the mask. In experiments, qualitative\nand quantitative results show that the proposed framework outperforms\nstate-of-the-art LF-DeOcc methods in both sparse and dense LF datasets.",

    "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search has attracted increasing attention in recent\nyears. Among them, differential NAS approaches such as DARTS, have gained\npopularity for the search efficiency. However, they still suffer from three\nmain issues, that are, the weak stability due to the performance collapse, the\npoor generalization ability of the searched architectures, and the inferior\nrobustness to different kinds of proxies. To solve the stability and\ngeneralization problems, a simple-but-effective regularization method, termed\nas Beta-Decay, is proposed to regularize the DARTS-based NAS searching process\n(i.e., $\\beta$-DARTS). Specifically, Beta-Decay regularization can impose\nconstraints to keep the value and variance of activated architecture parameters\nfrom being too large, thereby ensuring fair competition among architecture\nparameters and making the supernet less sensitive to the impact of input on the\noperation set. In-depth theoretical analyses on how it works and why it works\nare provided. Comprehensive experiments validate that Beta-Decay regularization\ncan help to stabilize the searching process and makes the searched network more\ntransferable across different datasets. To address the robustness problem, we\nfirst benchmark different NAS methods under a wide range of proxy data, proxy\nchannels, proxy layers and proxy epochs, since the robustness of NAS under\ndifferent kinds of proxies has not been explored before. We then conclude some\ninteresting findings and find that $\\beta$-DARTS always achieves the best\nresult among all compared NAS methods under almost all proxies. We further\nintroduce the novel flooding regularization to the weight optimization of\n$\\beta$-DARTS (i.e., Bi-level regularization), and experimentally and\ntheoretically verify its effectiveness for improving the proxy robustness of\ndifferentiable NAS.",

To this end, we present a dataset of 183 argumentative dialogues\nabout 3 controversial topics: veganism, Brexit and COVID-19 vaccination. The\ndialogues were collected using the Wizard of Oz approach, where wizards\nleverage a knowledge-base of arguments to converse with participants.\nOpen-mindedness is measured before and after engaging in the dialogue using a\nquestionnaire from the psychology literature, and success of the dialogue is\nmeasured as the change in the participant's stance towards those who hold\nopinions different to theirs.

    "abstract": "Electric vehicle charging demand models, with charging records as input, will\ninherently be biased toward the supply of available chargers, as the data do\nnot include demand lost from occupied stations and competitors. This lost\ndemand implies that the records only observe a fraction of the total demand,\ni.e. the observations are censored, and actual demand is likely higher than\nwhat the data reflect. Machine learning models often neglect to account for\nthis censored demand when forecasting the charging demand, which limits models'\napplications for future expansions and supply management. We address this gap\nby modelling the charging demand with probabilistic censorship-aware graph\nneural networks, which learn the latent demand distribution in both the spatial\nand temporal dimensions. We use GPS trajectories from cars in Copenhagen,\nDenmark, to study how censoring occurs and much demand is lost due to occupied\ncharging and competing services. We find that censorship varies throughout the\ncity and over time, encouraging spatial and temporal modelling. We find that in\nsome regions of Copenhagen, censorship occurs 61% of the time. Our results show\ncensorship-aware models provide better prediction and uncertainty estimation in\nactual future demand than censorship-unaware models. Our results suggest that\nfuture models based on charging records should account for the censoring to\nexpand the application areas of machine learning models in this supply\nmanagement and infrastructure expansion.",

We argue that alignment dialogues have a\nnumber of advantages in comparison to data-driven approaches, especially for\nbehaviour support agents, which aim to support users in achieving their desired\nfuture behaviours rather than their current behaviours. The advantages of\nalignment dialogues include allowing the users to directly convey higher-level\nconcepts to the agent, and making the agent more transparent and trustworthy.\nIn this paper we outline the concept and high-level structure of alignment\ndialogues.

One of the critical challenges of this task is to align semantic\nrepresentations for different modalities including vision and language.

For achieving the pixel-text alignment, we\ndesign a Vision-Language Bidirectional Attention module (VLBA) and resort\ncontrastive learning. Concretely, the VLBA enhances visual features by\npropagating semantic text representations to each pixel and promotes linguistic\nfeatures by fusing fine-grained image features. Moreover, we introduce the\ncross-modal instance contrastive loss to alleviate the influence of pixel\nsamples in ambiguous regions and improve the ability to align multi-modal\nrepresentations.

    "abstract": "Spherical robots can conduct surveillance in hostile, cluttered environments\nwithout being damaged, as their protective shell can safely house sensors such\nas cameras. However, lateral oscillations, also known as wobble, occur when\nthese sphere-shaped robots operate at low speeds, leading to shaky camera\nfeedback. These oscillations in a pendulum-actuated spherical robot are caused\nby the coupling between the forward and steering motions due to nonholonomic\nconstraints. Designing a controller to limit wobbling in these robots is\nchallenging due to their underactuated nature. We propose a model-based\ncontroller to navigate a pendulum-actuated spherical robot using wobble-free\nturning maneuvers consisting of circular arcs and straight lines. The model is\ndeveloped using Lagrange-D'Alembert equations and accounts for the coupled\nforward and steering motions. The model is further analyzed to derive\nexpressions for radius of curvature, precession rate, wobble amplitude, and\nwobble frequency during circular motions. Finally, we design an input-output\nfeedback linearization-based controller to control the robot's heading\ndirection and wobble. Overall, the proposed controller enables a teleoperator\nto command a specific forward velocity and pendulum angle as per the desired\nturning radius while limiting the robot's lateral oscillations to enhance the\nquality of camera feedback.",

    "abstract": "The sense of belonging to a community is a basic human need that impacts an\nindividuals behavior, long-term engagement, and job satisfaction, as revealed\nby research in disciplines such as psychology, healthcare, and education.\nDespite much research on how to retain developers in Open Source Software\nprojects and other virtual, peer-production communities, there is a paucity of\nresearch investigating what might contribute to a sense of belonging in these\ncommunities. To that end, we develop a theoretical model that seeks to\nunderstand the link between OSS developer motives and a Sense of Virtual\nCommunity. We test the model with a dataset collected in the Linux Kernel\ndeveloper community, using structural equation modeling techniques. Our results\nfor this case study show that intrinsic motivations - social or hedonic motives\n- are positively associated with a sense of virtual community, but living in an\nauthoritative country and being paid to contribute can reduce the sense of\nvirtual community. Based on these results, we offer suggestions for open source\nprojects to foster a sense of virtual community, with a view to retaining\ncontributors and improving projects sustainability.",

    "title": "Modeling Uncertain Feature Representation for Domain Generalization",
    "abstract": "Though deep neural networks have achieved impressive success on various\nvision tasks, obvious performance degradation still exists when models are\ntested in out-of-distribution scenarios. In addressing this limitation, we\nponder that the feature statistics (mean and standard deviation), which carry\nthe domain characteristics of the training data, can be properly manipulated to\nimprove the generalization ability of deep learning models. Existing methods\ncommonly consider feature statistics as deterministic values measured from the\nlearned features and do not explicitly model the uncertain statistics\ndiscrepancy caused by potential domain shifts during testing. In this paper, we\nimprove the network generalization ability by modeling domain shifts with\nuncertainty (DSU), i.e., characterizing the feature statistics as uncertain\ndistributions during training. Specifically, we hypothesize that the feature\nstatistic, after considering the potential uncertainties, follows a\nmultivariate Gaussian distribution. During inference, we propose an\ninstance-wise adaptation strategy that can adaptively deal with the\nunforeseeable shift and further enhance the generalization ability of the\ntrained model with negligible additional cost. We also conduct theoretical\nanalysis on the aspects of generalization error bound and the implicit\nregularization effect, showing the efficacy of our method. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method consistently improves the network\ngeneralization ability on multiple vision tasks, including image\nclassification, semantic segmentation, instance retrieval, and pose estimation.\nOur methods are simple yet effective and can be readily integrated into\nnetworks without additional trainable parameters or loss constraints.

Minimal problems are usually formulated\nas complex systems of polynomial equations. Many state-of-the-art efficient\npolynomial solvers are based on the action matrix method that has been\nautomated and highly optimised in recent years. In this paper we explore the\ntheory of sparse resultants for generating minimal solvers and propose a novel\napproach based on a using an extra polynomial with a special form.

However, for many existing FL systems, clients need to frequently\nexchange model parameters of large data size with the remote cloud server\ndirectly via wide-area networks (WAN), leading to significant communication\noverhead and long transmission time. To mitigate the communication bottleneck,\nwe resort to the hierarchical federated learning paradigm of HiFL, which reaps\nthe benefits of mobile edge computing and combines synchronous client-edge\nmodel aggregation and asynchronous edge-cloud model aggregation together to\ngreatly reduce the traffic volumes of WAN transmissions. Specifically, we first\nanalyze the convergence bound of HiFL theoretically and identify the key\ncontrollable factors for model performance improvement. We then advocate an\nenhanced design of HiFlash by innovatively integrating deep reinforcement\nlearning based adaptive staleness control and heterogeneity-aware client-edge\nassociation strategy to boost the system efficiency and mitigate the staleness\neffect without compromising model accuracy.

    "abstract": "Computational drug repositioning aims to discover new uses of drugs that have\nbeen marketed. However, the existing models suffer from the following\nlimitations. Firstly, in the real world, only a minority of diseases have\ndefinite treatment drugs. This leads to an imbalance in the proportion of\nvalidated drug-disease associations (positive samples) and unvalidated\ndrug-disease associations (negative samples), which disrupts the optimization\ngradient of the model. Secondly, the existing drug representation does not take\ninto account the behavioral information of the drug, resulting in its inability\nto comprehensively model the latent feature of the drug. In this work, we\npropose a balanced matrix factorization with embedded behavior information\n(BMF) for computational drug repositioning to address the above-mentioned\nshortcomings. Specifically, in the BMF model, we propose a novel balanced\ncontrastive loss (BCL) to optimize the category imbalance problem in\ncomputational drug repositioning. The BCL optimizes the parameters in the model\nby maximizing the similarity between the target drug and positive disease, and\nminimizing the similarity between the target drug and negative disease below\nthe margin. In addition, we designed a method to enhance drug representation\nusing its behavioral information. The comprehensive experiments on three\ncomputational drug repositioning datasets validate the effectiveness of the\nabove improvement points.

With the celebrated distributed\nsketching technique of palette sparsification [Assadi, Chen, and Khanna\nSODA'19], nodes limit themselves to $O(\\log n)$ independently sampled colors.\nThey showed that it suffices to color the resulting sparsified graph with edges\nbetween nodes that sampled a common color. To compute the actual coloring,\nhowever, that information must be gathered at a single server for centralized\nprocessing. We seek instead a local algorithm to compute such a coloring in the\nsparsified graph. The question is if this can be achieved in $poly(\\log n)$\ndistributed rounds with small messages.\nOur main result is an algorithm that computes a $\\Delta+1$-coloring after\npalette sparsification with $poly\\log n$ random colors per node and runs in\n$O(\\log^2 \\Delta + \\log^3 \\log n)$ rounds on the sparsified graph, using\n$O(\\log n)$-bit messages.

In order to deal with having only limited resources available\nfor conversational German and, at the same time, with a large variation among\nspeakers with respect to pronunciation characteristics, we improve a\nKaldi-based ASR system by incorporating a (large) knowledge-based pronunciation\nlexicon, while exploring different data-based methods to restrict the number of\npronunciation variants for each lexical entry.

    "title": "Computing Distance-based metrics on Very Large Graphs",
    "abstract": "We propose PROPAGATE, a fast approximation framework to estimate\ndistance-based metrics on very large graphs such as the (effective) diameter,\nthe (effective) radius, or the average distance within a small error. The\nframework assigns seeds to nodes and propagates them in a BFS-like fashion,\ncomputing the neighbors set until we obtain either the whole vertex set (the\ndiameter) or a given percentage (the effective diameter). At each iteration, we\nderive compressed Boolean representations of the neighborhood sets discovered\nso far. The PROPAGATE framework yields two algorithms: PROPAGATE-P, which\npropagates all the $s$ seeds in parallel, and PROPAGATE-s which propagates the\nseeds sequentially. For each node, the compressed representation of the\nPROPAGATE-P algorithm requires $s$ bits while that of PROPAGATE-S only $1$ bit.\nBoth algorithms compute the average distance, the effective diameter, the\ndiameter, and the connectivity rate within a small error with high probability:\nfor any $\\varepsilon>0$ and using $s=\\Theta\\left(\\frac{\\log\nn}{\\varepsilon^2}\\right)$ sample nodes, the error for the average distance is\nbounded by $\\xi = \\frac{\\varepsilon \\Delta}{\\alpha}$, the error for the\neffective diameter and the diameter are bounded by $\\xi =\n\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\alpha}$, and the error for the connectivity rate is bounded\nby $\\varepsilon$ where $\\Delta$ is the diameter and $\\alpha$ is a measure of\nconnectivity of the graph. The time complexity is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(m\\Delta\n\\frac{\\log n}{\\varepsilon^2}\\right)$, where $m$ is the number of edges of the\ngraph. The experimental results show that the PROPAGATE framework improves the\ncurrent state of the art both in accuracy and speed. Moreover, we\nexperimentally show that PROPAGATE-S is also very efficient for solving the All\nPair Shortest Path problem in very large graphs.",

    "title": "A Computationally Efficient Vectorized Implementation of Localizing  Gradient Damage Method in MATLAB",
    "abstract": "In this work, a recently developed fracture modeling method called localizing\ngradient damage method (LGDM) is implemented in MATLAB. MATLAB is well-known in\nthe computational research community for its simple and easy-to-learn coding\ninterface. As a result, MATLAB is generally preferred for the initial\ndevelopment (prototyping) of computational models by researchers. However,\nMATLAB-developed codes are seldom used for large-scale simulations (after\ninitial development is complete) due to their computational inefficiency.\nHence, a computationally efficient implementation of LGDM using MATLAB\nvectorization is presented in this work. The choice of LGDM (as the fracture\nmodeling method) is based on its thermodynamically consistent formulation built\nupon the micromorphic framework. Moreover, the non-linear coupled field\nformulation of LGDM makes it suitable for testing the computational efficiency\nof vectorized MATLAB implementation in a non-linear finite element setting. It\nis shown in this work that the vectorized MATLAB implementation can save\nsignificant computational resources and time as compared to non-vectorized\nimplementations (that are parallelized with MATLAB parfor). The vectorized\nMATLAB implementation is tested by solving numerical problems in 1D, 2D and 3D\non a consumer-grade PC, demonstrating the capability of vectorized\nimplementation to run simulations efficiently on systems with limited\nresources. The sample source codes are provided as supplementary materials that\nwould be helpful to researchers working on similar coupled field models.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel family of asymptotically stable, implicit-explicit,\nadaptive, time integration method (denoted with the $\\theta$-method) for the\nsolution of the fractional advection-diffusion-reaction (FADR) equations. This\nfamily of time integration method generalized the computationally explicit\n$L_1$-method adopted by Brunner (J. Comput.

The spectral analysis of the method\n(involving the group velocity and the phase speed) indicates a region of\nfavorable dispersion for a limited range of Peclet number. The numerical\ninversion of the coefficient matrix is avoided by exploiting the sparse\nstructure of the matrix in the iterative solver for the Poisson equation. The\naccuracy and the efficacy of the method is benchmarked using (a) the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) fractional diffusion equation, originally proposed by\nBrunner, and (b) the incompressible, subdiffusive dynamics of a planar\nviscoelastic channel flow of the Rouse chain melts (FADR equation with\nfractional time-derivative of order $\\alpha=\\nicefrac{1}{2}$) and the Zimm\nchain solution ($\\alpha=\\nicefrac{2}{3}$).

    "abstract": "While thinking aloud has been reported to positively affect problem-solving,\nthe effects of the presence of an embodied entity (e.g., a social robot) to\nwhom words can be directed remain mostly unexplored. In this work, we\ninvestigated the role of a robot in a \"rubber duck debugging\" setting, by\nanalyzing how a robot's listening behaviors could support a thinking-aloud\nproblem-solving session. Participants completed two different tasks while\nspeaking their thoughts aloud to either a robot or an inanimate object (a giant\nrubber duck). We implemented and tested two types of listener behavior in the\nrobot: a rule-based heuristic and a deep-learning-based model. In a\nbetween-subject user study with 101 participants, we evaluated how the presence\nof a robot affected users' engagement in thinking aloud, behavior during the\ntask, and self-reported user experience. In addition, we explored the impact of\nthe two robot listening behaviors on those measures. In contrast to prior work,\nour results indicate that neither the rule-based heuristic nor the deep\nlearning robot conditions improved performance or perception of the task,\ncompared to an inanimate object. We discuss potential explanations and shed\nlight on the feasibility of designing social robots as assistive tools in\nthinking-aloud problem-solving tasks.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel learning-based control policy with strong\ngeneralizability to new environments that enables a mobile robot to navigate\nautonomously through spaces filled with both static obstacles and dense crowds\nof pedestrians. The policy uses a unique combination of input data to generate\nthe desired steering angle and forward velocity: a short history of lidar data,\nkinematic data about nearby pedestrians, and a sub-goal point. The policy is\ntrained in a reinforcement learning setting using a reward function that\ncontains a novel term based on velocity obstacles to guide the robot to\nactively avoid pedestrians and move towards the goal. Through a series of 3D\nsimulated experiments with up to 55 pedestrians, this control policy is able to\nachieve a better balance between collision avoidance and speed (i.e. higher\nsuccess rate and faster average speed) than state-of-the-art model-based and\nlearning-based policies, and it also generalizes better to different crowd\nsizes and unseen environments. An extensive series of hardware experiments\ndemonstrate the ability of this policy to directly work in different real-world\nenvironments with different crowd sizes with zero retraining. Furthermore, a\nseries of simulated and hardware experiments show that the control policy also\nworks in highly constrained static environments on a different robot platform\nwithout any additional training. Lastly, we summarize several important lessons\nthat can be applied to other robot learning systems.

Existing animation edition methods either work\ndirectly on the motion data, providing precise but tedious tools, or manipulate\nsemantic style categories, taking control away from the user. As a middle\nground, we propose a new character motion edition paradigm allowing\nhigher-level manipulations without sacrificing controllability. We describe the\nconcept of pose metrics, objective value functions which can be used to edit\nanimation, leaving the style interpretation up to the user. We then propose an\nedition pipeline to edit animation data using pose metrics.",

    "abstract": "Mobile augmented reality (MAR) applications extended in the metaverse could\nprovide mixed and immersive experiences by amalgamating the virtual and\nphysical world. However, the joint consideration between MAR and metaverse\nseeks the reliable and high quality support for foreground interactions and\nbackground contents from these applications, which intensifies their\nconsumption in energy, caching and computing resources. To tackle these\nchallenges, a more flexible request assignment and resource allocation with\nmore efficient processing are proposed in this paper through anchoring\ndecomposed metaverse AR services at different edge nodes and proactively\ncaching background metaverse region models embedded with target Augmented\nReality Objects (AROs).Advanced terminals are also considered to further reduce\nservice delay at an acceptable cost of energy consumption.We then propose and\nsolve a joint optimization problem that explicitly considers the balance\nbetween service delay and energy consumption under the constraint of user\nperception quality in a mobility event.By also explicitly taking into account\ncapabilities of user terminals, the proposed optimized scheme is compared to\nits terminal oblivious version in this paper. According to a wide set of\nnumerical investigations, the proposed scheme owns advantages in service\nlatency and energy efficiency over other nominal baseline schemes which neglect\ncapacities of terminals, user physical mobility, service decomposition and the\ninherent multi modality of the metaverse MAR service.",

The main application is to cell-free networks, where each\naccess point (AP) must typically satisfy an individual power constraint and\nform its transmit signal on the basis of possibly partial sharing of data\nbearing signals and channel state information. Our duality principle applies to\nergodic achievable rates given by the popular hardening bound, and it can be\ninterpreted as a nontrivial generalization of a previous result by Yu and Lan\nfor deterministic channels. This generalization allows us to cover more\ninvolved information constraints, and to show that optimal joint precoders can\nbe obtained using a variation of the recently developed team minimum\nmean-square error method. As particular examples, we solve the problems of\noptimal centralized and local precoding design in user-centric cell-free\nmassive MIMO networks subject to per-AP power constraints.",

In recent times, significant advances have been made in\nmultilingual understanding due to the steeply increasing necessity of working\nin different languages.

We can leverage the power of machine\ntranslation to skip the tiresome part of translating datasets from one language\nto another.

To ensure\nthe effectiveness of the workload simulation, it is necessary to dynamically\nevaluate the similarity of system inner status using key performance\nindicators(KPIs), which provide a comprehensive record of the system status,\nbetween the simulated workload and real workload by injecting workload into the\nsystem. However, due to the characteristics of KPIs, including large data size,\namplitude differences, phase shifts, non-smoothness, high dimension, and Large\nnumerical span, it is unpractical to evaluation on the full volume of KPIs and\nis challenging to measure the similarity between KPIs. In this paper, we\npropose a similarity metric algorithm for KPIs, ESBD, which describes both\nshape and intensity similarity. Around ESBD, a KPIs-based quality evaluation of\nworkload simulation(KEWS) was proposed, which consists of four steps: KPIs\npreprocessing, KPIs screening, KPIs clustering, and KPIs evaluation. These\ntechniques help mitigate the negative impact of the KPIs characteristics and\ngive a comprehensive evaluation result.

The prevailing methods,\nDynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and its extensions are based on least squares\nestimates that can be shown to be biased towards data that are densely\npopulated. The DE formula consisting of inner products of a nonlinear state\ntransition function with observable functions does not incur this biased\nestimation problem and thus serves as a desirable alternative to DMD. However,\nthe original DE formula requires knowledge of the nonlinear state equation,\nwhich is not available in many practical applications. In this paper, the DE\nformula is extended to a data-driven method, Data-Driven Encoding (DDE) of\nKoopman operator, in which the inner products are calculated from data taken\nfrom a nonlinear dynamic system. An effective algorithm is presented for the\ncomputation of the inner products, and their convergence to true values is\nproven. Numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of DDE compared to\nExtended DMD. The experiments demonstrate robustness to data distribution and\nthe convergent properties of DDE, guaranteeing accuracy improvements with\nadditional sample points.

    "abstract": "This letter presents a novel hybrid method that leverages deep learning to\nexploit the multi-resolution analysis capability of the wavelets, in order to\ndenoise a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal. Under the proposed method, a noisy\nPPG sequence of length N is first decomposed into L detailed coefficients using\nthe fast wavelet transform (FWT). Then, the clean PPG sequence is reconstructed\nas follows. A custom feedforward neural network (FFNN) provides the binary\nweights for each of the wavelet sub-signals outputted by the inverse-FWT block.\nThis way, all those sub-signals which correspond to noise or artefacts are\ndiscarded during reconstruction. The FFNN is trained on the Beth Israel\nDeaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) dataset under the supervised learning\nframework, whereby we compute the mean squared-error (MSE) between the denoised\nsequence and the reference clean PPG signal, and compute the gradient of the\nMSE for the back-propagation. Numerical results show that the proposed method\neffectively denoises the corrupted PPG and video-PPG signal.",

Error-related potentials (ErrPs) are a\nparticular brain signal elicited when one commits or observes an erroneous\nevent.

Recent works have revealed\nparticular cognitive processes such as awareness, embodiment, and\npredictability that contribute to ErrP variations. In this paper, we explore\nthe performance of classifier transferability when trained on different ErrP\nvariation datasets generated by varying the levels of awareness and embodiment\nfor a given task. In particular, we look at transference between observational\nand interactive ErrP categories when elicited by similar and differing tasks.\nOur empirical results provide an exploratory analysis into the ErrP\ntransferability problem from a data perspective.",

While there is an\nextensive theory on infinite dimensional representations in the operator sense,\nthere are few constructive results on how to select the observables to realize\nthem. When it comes to the possibility of finite Koopman representations, which\nare highly important form a practical point of view, there is no constructive\ntheory. Hence, in practice, often a data-based method and ad-hoc choice of the\nobservable functions is used. When truncating to a finite number of basis,\nthere is also no clear indication of the introduced approximation error. In\nthis paper, we propose a systematic method to compute the finite dimensional\nKoopman embedding of a specific class of polynomial nonlinear systems in\ncontinuous-time such that, the embedding, without approximation, can fully\nrepresent the dynamics of the nonlinear system.",

    "abstract": "Reliable and accurate high-resolution maps of surface waters are critical\ninputs to models that help understand the impacts and relationships between the\nenvironment and human activities. Advances in remote sensing technology have\nopened up the possibility of mapping very small bodies of water that are\nclosely related to people's daily lives and are mostly affected by\nanthropogenic pressures. However, a robust and scalable method that works well\nfor all types of water bodies located in diverse landscapes at high-resolution\nhas yet to be developed. This paper presents a method that can accurately\nextract surface water bodies up to a very fine scale in a wide variety of\nlandscapes. Unlike optical image-based methods, the proposed method exploits\nthe robust assumption that surface water is flat as gravity always pulls liquid\nmolecules down. Based on this natural law, the proposed method extracts\naccurate, high-resolution water bodies including their elevations in a fully\nautomated manner using only airborne LiDAR data. Extensive experiments with\nlarge ($\\approx$ 2,500$km^{2}$) and diverse landscapes (urban, coastal, and\nmountainous areas) confirmed that our method can generate accurate results\nwithout site-specific parameter tunings for varied types of surface water. The\nproposed method enables an automated, scalable high-resolution mapping of a\nfull 3D topography that includes both water and terrain, using only point\nclouds for the first time. We will release the code to the public in the hope\nthat our work would lead to more effective solutions to help build a\nsustainable and resilient environment.",

As manual data labeling needed to develop text mining models is\nresource intensive, we investigated whether off-the-shelf text mining models\ndeveloped at external institutions, together with limited within-institution\nlabeled data, could be used to reliably extract study variables to conduct\nassociation studies.\nMaterials and Methods: We developed multiple text mining models on different\ncombinations of within-institution and external-institution data to extract\nsocial factors from discharge reports of intensive care patients. Subsequently,\nwe assessed the associations between social factors and having a\ndo-not-resuscitate/intubate code. Results: Important differences were found\nbetween associations based on manually labeled data compared to text-mined\nsocial factors in three out of five cases. Adopting external-institution text\nmining models using manually labeled within-institution data resulted in models\nwith higher F1-scores, but not in meaningfully different associations.\nDiscussion: While text mining facilitated scaling analyses to larger samples\nleading to discovering a larger number of associations, the estimates may be\nunreliable. Confirmation is needed with better text mining models, ideally on a\nlarger manually labeled dataset.\nConclusion: The currently used text mining models were not sufficiently\naccurate to be used reliably in an association study.

    "abstract": "We propose causal recurrent variational autoencoder (CR-VAE), a novel\ngenerative model that is able to learn a Granger causal graph from a\nmultivariate time series x and incorporates the underlying causal mechanism\ninto its data generation process. Distinct to the classical recurrent VAEs, our\nCR-VAE uses a multi-head decoder, in which the $p$-th head is responsible for\ngenerating the $p$-th dimension of $\\mathbf{x}$ (i.e., $\\mathbf{x}^p$). By\nimposing a sparsity-inducing penalty on the weights (of the decoder) and\nencouraging specific sets of weights to be zero, our CR-VAE learns a sparse\nadjacency matrix that encodes causal relations between all pairs of variables.\nThanks to this causal matrix, our decoder strictly obeys the underlying\nprinciples of Granger causality, thereby making the data generating process\ntransparent. We develop a two-stage approach to train the overall objective.\nEmpirically, we evaluate the behavior of our model in synthetic data and two\nreal-world human brain datasets involving, respectively, the\nelectroencephalography (EEG) signals and the functional magnetic resonance\nimaging (fMRI) data. Our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art time\nseries generative models both qualitatively and quantitatively.

    "abstract": "When learning from very small data sets, the resulting models can make many\nmistakes. For example, consider learning predictors for open source project\nhealth. The training data for this task may be very small (e.g. five years of\ndata, collected every month means just 60 rows of training data). Using this\ndata, prior work had unacceptably large errors in their learned predictors. We\nshow that these high errors rates can be tamed by better configuration of the\ncontrol parameters of the machine learners. For example, we present here a {\\em\nlandscape analytics} method (called SNEAK)\nthat (a)~clusters the data to find the general landscape of the\nhyperparameters; then\n(b)~explores a few representatives from each part of that landscape.\nSNEAK is both\nfaster and and more effective than\nprior state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization algorithms (FLASH,\nHYPEROPT, OPTUNA, and differential evolution). More importantly, the\nconfigurations found by SNEAK had far less error that other methods.\nWe conjecture that SNEAK works so well since it finds the most informative\nregions of the hyperparameters, then jumps to those regions. Other methods\n(that do not reflect over the landscape) can waste time exploring less\ninformative options.\nFrom this, we make the following conclusions. Firstly, for predicting open\nsource project health, we recommend landscape analytics (e.g.SNEAK). Secondly,\nand more generally, when learning from very small data sets, using\nhyperparameter optimization (e.g. SNEAK) to select learning control parameters.\nDue to its speed and implementation simplicity, we suggest SNEAK might also be\nuseful in other ``data-light'' SE domains.\nTo assist other researchers in repeating, improving, or even refuting our\nresults, all our scripts and data are available on GitHub at\nhttps://github.com/zxcv123456qwe/niSneak",

    "title": "TAAL: Test-time Augmentation for Active Learning in Medical Image  Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Deep learning methods typically depend on the availability of labeled data,\nwhich is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Active learning addresses such\neffort by prioritizing which samples are best to annotate in order to maximize\nthe performance of the task model. While frameworks for active learning have\nbeen widely explored in the context of classification of natural images, they\nhave been only sparsely used in medical image segmentation. The challenge\nresides in obtaining an uncertainty measure that reveals the best candidate\ndata for annotation. This paper proposes Test-time Augmentation for Active\nLearning (TAAL), a novel semi-supervised active learning approach for\nsegmentation that exploits the uncertainty information offered by data\ntransformations. Our method applies cross-augmentation consistency during\ntraining and inference to both improve model learning in a semi-supervised\nfashion and identify the most relevant unlabeled samples to annotate next. In\naddition, our consistency loss uses a modified version of the JSD to further\nimprove model performance. By relying on data transformations rather than on\nexternal modules or simple heuristics typically used in uncertainty-based\nstrategies, TAAL emerges as a simple, yet powerful task-agnostic\nsemi-supervised active learning approach applicable to the medical domain. Our\nresults on a publicly-available dataset of cardiac images show that TAAL\noutperforms existing baseline methods in both fully-supervised and\nsemi-supervised settings. Our implementation is publicly available on\nhttps://github.com/melinphd/TAAL.",

To address\nthese issues, we propose the Masked Vector Quantization (MVQ) framework which\nincreases the representational capacity of each code vector by learning mask\nconfigurations via a stochastic winner-takes-all training regime called\nMultiple Hypothese Dropout (MH-Dropout). On ImageNet 64$\\times$64, MVQ reduces\nFID in existing vector quantization architectures by up to $68\\%$ at 2 tokens\nper instance and $57\\%$ at 5 tokens. These improvements widen as codebook\nentries is reduced and allows for $7\\textit{--}45\\times$ speed-up in token\nsampling during inference.

    "abstract": "Today's large language models (LLMs) routinely generate coherent, grammatical\nand seemingly meaningful paragraphs of text. This achievement has led to\nspeculation that these networks are -- or will soon become -- \"thinking\nmachines\", capable of performing tasks that require abstract knowledge and\nreasoning. Here, we review the capabilities of LLMs by considering their\nperformance on two different aspects of language use: 'formal linguistic\ncompetence', which includes knowledge of rules and patterns of a given\nlanguage, and 'functional linguistic competence', a host of cognitive abilities\nrequired for language understanding and use in the real world. Drawing on\nevidence from cognitive neuroscience, we show that formal competence in humans\nrelies on specialized language processing mechanisms, whereas functional\ncompetence recruits multiple extralinguistic capacities that comprise human\nthought, such as formal reasoning, world knowledge, situation modeling, and\nsocial cognition. In line with this distinction, LLMs show impressive (although\nimperfect) performance on tasks requiring formal linguistic competence, but\nfail on many tests requiring functional competence. Based on this evidence, we\nargue that (1) contemporary LLMs should be taken seriously as models of formal\nlinguistic skills; (2) models that master real-life language use would need to\nincorporate or develop not only a core language module, but also multiple\nnon-language-specific cognitive capacities required for modeling thought.\nOverall, a distinction between formal and functional linguistic competence\nhelps clarify the discourse surrounding LLMs' potential and provides a path\ntoward building models that understand and use language in human-like ways.",

    "abstract": "Designing visually appealing layouts for multimedia documents containing\ntext, graphs and images requires a form of creative intelligence. Modelling the\ngeneration of layouts has recently gained attention due to its importance in\naesthetics and communication style. In contrast to standard prediction tasks,\nthere are a range of acceptable layouts which depend on user preferences. For\nexample, a poster designer may prefer logos on the top-left while another\nprefers logos on the bottom-right. Both are correct choices yet existing\nmachine learning models treat layouts as a single choice prediction problem. In\nsuch situations, these models would simply average over all possible choices\ngiven the same input forming a degenerate sample. In the above example, this\nwould form an unacceptable layout with a logo in the centre. In this paper, we\npresent an auto-regressive neural network architecture, called LayoutMCL, that\nuses multi-choice prediction and winner-takes-all loss to effectively stabilise\nlayout generation. LayoutMCL avoids the averaging problem by using multiple\npredictors to learn a range of possible options for each layout object. This\nenables LayoutMCL to generate multiple and diverse layouts from a single input\nwhich is in contrast with existing approaches which yield similar layouts with\nminor variations. Through quantitative benchmarks on real data (magazine,\ndocument and mobile app layouts), we demonstrate that LayoutMCL reduces\nFr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) by 83-98% and generates significantly more\ndiversity in comparison to existing approaches.",

Here we show that data-aware customization of\nactivation functions can result in striking reductions in neural network error.\nWe first give a simple linear algebraic explanation of the role of activation\nfunctions in neural networks; then, through connection with the\nDiaconis-Shahshahani Approximation Theorem, we propose a set of criteria for\ngood activation functions. As a case study, we consider regression tasks with a\npartially exchangeable target function, \\emph{i.e.} $f(u,v,w)=f(v,u,w)$ for\n$u,v\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ and $w\\in \\mathbb{R}^k$, and prove that for such a target\nfunction, using an even activation function in at least one of the layers\nguarantees that the prediction preserves partial exchangeability for best\nperformance. Since even activation functions are seldom used in practice, we\ndesigned the ``seagull'' even activation function $\\log(1+x^2)$ according to\nour criteria. Empirical testing on over two dozen 9-25 dimensional examples\nwith different local smoothness, curvature, and degree of exchangeability\nrevealed that a simple substitution with the ``seagull'' activation function in\nan already-refined neural network can lead to an order-of-magnitude reduction\nin error. This improvement was most pronounced when the activation function\nsubstitution was applied to the layer in which the exchangeable variables are\nconnected for the first time. While the improvement is greatest for\nlow-dimensional data, experiments on the CIFAR10 image classification dataset\nshowed that use of ``seagull'' can reduce error even for high-dimensional\ncases.

However, multiple challenges remain to\nbe addressed for deploying FL in real-world Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks\nwith hierarchies. Although existing works have proposed various approaches to\naccount data heterogeneity, system heterogeneity, unexpected stragglers and\nscalibility, none of them provides a systematic solution to address all of the\nchallenges in a hierarchical and unreliable IoT network. In this paper, we\npropose an asynchronous and hierarchical framework (Async-HFL) for performing\nFL in a common three-tier IoT network architecture. In response to the largely\nvaried delays, Async-HFL employs asynchronous aggregations at both the gateway\nand the cloud levels thus avoids long waiting time. To fully unleash the\npotential of Async-HFL in converging speed under system heterogeneities and\nstragglers, we design device selection at the gateway level and device-gateway\nassociation at the cloud level. Device selection chooses edge devices to\ntrigger local training in real-time while device-gateway association determines\nthe network topology periodically after several cloud epochs, both satisfying\nbandwidth limitation. We evaluate Async-HFL's convergence speedup using\nlarge-scale simulations based on ns-3 and a network topology from NYCMesh. Our\nresults show that Async-HFL converges 1.08-1.31x faster in wall-clock time and\nsaves up to 21.6% total communication cost compared to state-of-the-art\nasynchronous FL algorithms (with client selection).

We revisit a semi-oblivious approach to this problem: each\nsource-destination pair is assigned a small set of predefined paths before the\ndemand is revealed, while the sending rates along the paths can be optimally\nadapted to the demand. This approach has been considered in practice in network\ntraffic engineering due to its superior robustness and performance as compared\nto both oblivious routing and traditional traffic engineering approaches.\nWe show the existence of sparse semi-oblivious routings: only $O(\\log n)$\npaths are selected between each pair of vertices. The routing is $(poly \\log\nn)$-competitive for all demands against the offline-optimal congestion\nobjective. Even for the well-studied case of hypercubes, no such result was\nknown: our deterministic and oblivious selection of $O(\\log n)$ paths is the\nfirst simple construction of a deterministic oblivious structure that\nnear-optimally assigns source-destination pairs to few routes. Our results\ncontrast the current solely-negative landscape of results for semi-oblivious\nrouting. We give the sparsity-competitiveness trade-off for lower sparsities\nand nearly match it with a lower bound.\nOur construction is extremely simple: Sample the few paths from any\ncompetitive oblivious routing. Indeed, this natural construction was used in\ntraffic engineering as an unproven heuristic. We give a satisfactory\ntheoretical justification for their empirical effectiveness: the\ncompetitiveness of the construction improves exponentially with the number of\npaths.

In this paper, we propose a complementary dynamic regression (DR)\nframework to enhance existing deep multistep traffic forecasting frameworks\nthrough structured specifications and learning for the residual process.\nSpecifically, we assume the residuals of the base model (i.e., a well-developed\ntraffic forecasting model) are governed by a matrix-variate seasonal\nautoregressive (AR) model, which can be seamlessly integrated into the training\nprocess by redesigning the overall loss function. Parameters in the DR\nframework can be jointly learned with the base model.

    "title": "An Empirical Study of Deep Learning Sentiment Detection Tools for  Software Engineering in Cross-Platform Settings",
    "abstract": "Sentiment detection in software engineering (SE) has shown promise to support\ndiverse development activities. However, given the diversity of SE platforms,\nSE-specific sentiment detection tools may suffer in performance in\ncross-platform settings. Recently deep learning (DL)-based SE-specific\nsentiment detection tools are found to offer superior performance than shallow\nmachine learning (ML) based/rule-based tools. However, it is not known how the\nDL tools perform in cross-platform settings. In this paper, we study whether\nSE-specific DL sentiment detectors are more effective than shallow\nML-based/rule-based sentiment detectors in cross-platform settings. In three\ndatasets, we study three DL tools (SEntiMoji, BERT4SEntiSE, RNN4SentiSE) and\ncompare those against three baselines: two shallow learning tools (Senti4SD,\nSentiCR) and one rule-based tool (SentistrengthSE). We find that (1) The deep\nlearning SD tools for SE, BERT4SentiSE outperform other supervised tools in\ncross-platform settings in most cases, but then the tool is outperformed by the\nrule-based tool SentistrengthSE in most cases. (2) BERT4SentiSE outperforms\nSentistrengthSE by large margin in within-platform settings across the three\ndatasets and is only narrowly outperformed by SentiStrengthSE in four out of\nthe six cross-platform settings. This finding offers hope for the feasibility\nto further improve a pre-trained transformer model like BERT4SentiSE in\ncross-platform settings. (3) The two best-performing deep learning tools\n(BERT4SentiSE and SentiMoji) show varying level performance drop across the\nthree datasets. We find that this inconsistency is mainly due to the\n\"subjectivity in annotation\" and performance improvement for the studied\nsupervised tools in cross-platform settings may require the fixing of the\ndatasets.",

    "title": "Graph Topology Learning Under Privacy Constraints",
    "abstract": "Graph learning, which aims to infer the underlying topology behind high\ndimension data, has attracted intense attention. In this study, we shed a new\nlight on graph learning by considering a pragmatic scenario where data are\nprivacy sensitive and located in separated clients (devices or organizations).\nThe main difficulty in learning graphs in this scenario is that we cannot\nprocess all the data in a central server, because the data are not allowed to\nleave the local clients due to privacy concerns. The problem becomes more\nchallenging when data of different clients are non-IID, since it is\nunreasonable to learn a global graph for heterogeneous data. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel framework in which a personalized graph for each\nclient and a consensus graph are jointly learned in a federated fashion.\nSpecifically, we commute model updates instead of raw data to the central\nserver in the proposed federated algorithm. A provable convergence analysis\nshows that the algorithm enjoys $\\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ convergence rate. To further\nenhance privacy, we design a deferentially privacy algorithm to prevent the\ninformation of the raw data from being leaked when transferring model updates.\nA theoretical guidance is provided on how to ensure that the algorithm\nsatisfies differential privacy. We also analyze the impact of differential\nprivacy on the convergence of our algorithm. Finally, extensive experiments on\nboth synthetic and real world data are carried out to validate the proposed\nmodels and algorithms. Experimental results illustrate that our framework is\nable to learn graphs effectively in the target scenario.",

In addition, the global restrictions of motion motivated\nlarge investments in online/hybrid education. In this work, a newly developed\nrobotics education kit and its ecosystem are presented which is used as the\nbackbone of an online/hybrid course in teleoperated robots. The students are\nassembled into teams, design, fabricate, and control a master device and\ngripper, and compete in a teleoperation challenge. The kit is low cost (<\n100USD), which allows higher-learning institutions to provide one kit per\nstudent and they can learn in a risk-free environment. As of now, 53 such kits\nhave been assembled and sent to course participants in eight countries. As\nmajor success stories, we show an example of gripper and master designed for\nthe proposed course.

    "abstract": "Temperature field prediction is of great importance in the thermal design of\nsystems engineering, and building the surrogate model is an effective way for\nthe task. Generally, large amounts of labeled data are required to guarantee a\ngood prediction performance of the surrogate model, especially the deep\nlearning model, which have more parameters and better representational ability.\nHowever, labeled data, especially high-fidelity labeled data, are usually\nexpensive to obtain and sometimes even impossible. To solve this problem, this\npaper proposes a pithy deep multi-fidelity model (DMFM) for temperature field\nprediction, which takes advantage of low-fidelity data to boost the performance\nwith less high-fidelity data. First, a pre-train and fine-tune paradigm are\ndeveloped in DMFM to train the low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, which\nsignificantly reduces the complexity of the deep surrogate model. Then, a\nself-supervised learning method for training the physics-driven deep\nmulti-fidelity model (PD-DMFM) is proposed, which fully utilizes the physics\ncharacteristics of the engineering systems and reduces the dependence on large\namounts of labeled low-fidelity data in the training process. Two diverse\ntemperature field prediction problems are constructed to validate the\neffectiveness of DMFM and PD-DMFM, and the result shows that the proposed\nmethod can greatly reduce the dependence of the model on high-fidelity data.",

Here we\npropose a methodology for explainable classification of fundus images to\nuncover the mechanism(s) by which CNNs successfully predict the labels. We used\npatient sex as a case study to validate our proposed methodology.\nApproach: First, we used a set of 4746 fundus images, including training,\nvalidation and test partitions, to fine-tune a pre-trained CNN on the sex\nclassification task. Next, we utilized deep learning explainability tools to\nhypothesize possible ways sex differences in the retina manifest. We measured\nnumerous retinal properties relevant to our hypotheses through image\nsegmentation to identify those significantly different between males and\nfemales. To tackle the multiple comparisons problem, we shortlisted the\nparameters by testing them on a set of 100 fundus images distinct from the\nimages used for fine-tuning. Finally, we used an additional 400 images, not\nincluded in any previous set, to reveal significant sex differences in the\nretina.\nResults: We observed that the peripapillary area is darker in males compared\nto females ($p=.023, d=.243$). We also observed that males have richer retinal\nvasculature networks by showing a higher number of branches ($p=.016, d=.272$)\nand nodes ($p=.014, d=.299$) and a larger total length of branches ($p=.045,\nd=.206$) in the vessel graph. Also, vessels cover a greater area in the\nsuperior temporal quadrant of the retina in males compared to females\n($p=0.048, d=.194$).\nConclusions: Our methodology reveals retinal features in fundus photographs\nthat allow CNNs to predict traits currently unknown, but meaningful to experts.",

It is critical to have confidence in AI's trustworthiness. ML\ntechniques have been useful in predicting important parameters and improving\nmodel performance. However, for these AI techniques to be useful for making\ndecisions, they need to be audited, accounted for, and easy to understand.\nTherefore, the use of Explainable AI (XAI) and interpretable machine learning\n(IML) is crucial for the accurate prediction of prognostics, such as remaining\nuseful life (RUL) in a digital twin system to make it intelligent while\nensuring that the AI model is transparent in its decision-making processes and\nthat the predictions it generates can be understood and trusted by users. By\nusing AI that is explainable, interpretable, and trustworthy, intelligent\ndigital twin systems can make more accurate predictions of RUL, leading to\nbetter maintenance and repair planning and, ultimately, improved system\nperformance. The objective of this paper is to understand the idea of XAI and\nIML and justify the important role of ML/AI in the Digital Twin framework and\ncomponents, which requires XAI to understand the prediction better. This paper\nexplains the importance of XAI and IML in both local and global aspects to\nensure the use of trustworthy ML/AI applications for RUL prediction.

    "abstract": "Existing salient object detection methods often adopt deeper and wider\nnetworks for better performance, resulting in heavy computational burden and\nslow inference speed. This inspires us to rethink saliency detection to achieve\na favorable balance between efficiency and accuracy. To this end, we design a\nlightweight framework while maintaining satisfying competitive accuracy.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel trilateral decoder framework by decoupling the\nU-shape structure into three complementary branches, which are devised to\nconfront the dilution of semantic context, loss of spatial structure and\nabsence of boundary detail, respectively. Along with the fusion of three\nbranches, the coarse segmentation results are gradually refined in structure\ndetails and boundary quality. Without adding additional learnable parameters,\nwe further propose Scale-Adaptive Pooling Module to obtain multi-scale\nreceptive filed. In particular, on the premise of inheriting this framework, we\nrethink the relationship among accuracy, parameters and speed via network\ndepth-width tradeoff. With these insightful considerations, we comprehensively\ndesign shallower and narrower models to explore the maximum potential of\nlightweight SOD. Our models are purposed for different application\nenvironments: 1) a tiny version CTD-S (1.7M, 125FPS) for resource constrained\ndevices, 2) a fast version CTD-M (12.6M, 158FPS) for speed-demanding scenarios,\n3) a standard version CTD-L (26.5M, 84FPS) for high-performance platforms.\nExtensive experiments validate the superiority of our method, which achieves\nbetter efficiency-accuracy balance across five benchmarks.",

Many\nlarge-scale public CXR datasets have been curated for detection of\nabnormalities using deep learning. However, each of these datasets focus on\ndetecting a subset of disease labels that could be present in a CXR, thus\nlimiting their clinical utility. Furthermore, the distributed nature of these\ndatasets, along with data sharing regulations, make it difficult to share and\ncreate a complete representation of disease labels. We propose surgical\naggregation, a federated learning framework for aggregating knowledge from\ndistributed datasets with different disease labels into a 'global' deep\nlearning model. We randomly divided the NIH Chest X-Ray 14 dataset into\ntraining (70%), validation (10%), and test (20%) splits with no patient overlap\nand conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, we pruned the disease\nlabels to create two 'toy' datasets containing 11 and 8 labels respectively\nwith 4 overlapping labels. For the second experiment, we pruned the disease\nlabels to create two disjoint 'toy' datasets with 7 labels each. We observed\nthat the surgically aggregated 'global' model resulted in excellent performance\nacross both experiments when compared to a 'baseline' model trained on complete\ndisease labels. The overlapping and disjoint experiments had an AUROC of 0.87\nand 0.86 respectively, compared to the baseline AUROC of 0.87. We used surgical\naggregation to harmonize the NIH Chest X-Ray 14 and CheXpert datasets into a\n'global' model with an AUROC of 0.85 and 0.83 respectively. Our results show\nthat surgical aggregation could be used to develop clinically useful deep\nlearning models by aggregating knowledge from distributed datasets with diverse\ntasks, a step forward towards bridging the gap from bench to bedside.",

    "title": "Audio2Gestures: Generating Diverse Gestures from Audio",
    "abstract": "People may perform diverse gestures affected by various mental and physical\nfactors when speaking the same sentences. This inherent one-to-many\nrelationship makes co-speech gesture generation from audio particularly\nchallenging. Conventional CNNs/RNNs assume one-to-one mapping, and thus tend to\npredict the average of all possible target motions, easily resulting in\nplain/boring motions during inference. So we propose to explicitly model the\none-to-many audio-to-motion mapping by splitting the cross-modal latent code\ninto shared code and motion-specific code. The shared code is expected to be\nresponsible for the motion component that is more correlated to the audio while\nthe motion-specific code is expected to capture diverse motion information that\nis more independent of the audio. However, splitting the latent code into two\nparts poses extra training difficulties. Several crucial training\nlosses/strategies, including relaxed motion loss, bicycle constraint, and\ndiversity loss, are designed to better train the VAE.\nExperiments on both 3D and 2D motion datasets verify that our method\ngenerates more realistic and diverse motions than previous state-of-the-art\nmethods, quantitatively and qualitatively. Besides, our formulation is\ncompatible with discrete cosine transformation (DCT) modeling and other popular\nbackbones (\\textit{i.e.} RNN, Transformer). As for motion losses and\nquantitative motion evaluation, we find structured losses/metrics\n(\\textit{e.g.} STFT) that consider temporal and/or spatial context complement\nthe most commonly used point-wise losses (\\textit{e.g.} PCK), resulting in\nbetter motion dynamics and more nuanced motion details. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat our method can be readily used to generate motion sequences with\nuser-specified motion clips on the timeline.",

Internet\nservice providers (ISPs) are best poised to play key roles in mitigating risks\nby automatically inferring active IoT devices per household and notifying users\nof vulnerable ones. Developing a scalable inference method that can perform\nrobustly across thousands of home networks is a non-trivial task. This paper\nfocuses on the challenges of developing and applying data-driven inference\nmodels when labeled data of device behaviors is limited and the distribution of\ndata changes (concept drift) across time and space domains. Our contributions\nare three-fold: (1) We collect and analyze network traffic of 24 types of\nconsumer IoT devices from 12 real homes over six weeks to highlight the\nchallenge of temporal and spatial concept drifts in network behavior of IoT\ndevices; (2) We analyze the performance of two inference strategies, namely\n\"global inference\" (a model trained on a combined set of all labeled data from\ntraining homes) and \"contextualized inference\" (several models each trained on\nthe labeled data from a training home) in the presence of concept drifts; and\n(3) To manage concept drifts, we develop a method that dynamically applies the\n``closest'' model (from a set) to network traffic of unseen homes during the\ntesting phase, yielding better performance in 20% of scenarios.",

In contrast, robots can not perform reactive\nmanipulation and they mostly operate in open-loop while interacting with their\nenvironment. Consequently, the current manipulation algorithms either are\ninefficient in performance or can only work in highly structured environments.\nIn this paper, we present closed-loop control of a complex manipulation task\nwhere a robot uses a tool to interact with objects. Manipulation using a tool\nleads to complex kinematics and contact constraints that need to be satisfied\nfor generating feasible manipulation trajectories. We first present an\nopen-loop controller design using Non-Linear Programming (NLP) that satisfies\nthese constraints. In order to design a closed-loop controller, we present a\npose estimator of objects and tools using tactile sensors. Using our tactile\nestimator, we design a closed-loop controller based on Model Predictive Control\n(MPC). The proposed algorithm is verified using a 6 DoF manipulator on tasks\nusing a variety of objects and tools.

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation plays a critical role in various computer vision\nand robotics applications such as localization, mapping, and 3D object\ndetection. Recently, learning-based algorithms achieve huge success in depth\nestimation by training models with a large amount of data in a supervised\nmanner. However, it is challenging to acquire dense ground truth depth labels\nfor supervised training, and the unsupervised depth estimation using monocular\nsequences emerges as a promising alternative. Unfortunately, most studies on\nunsupervised depth estimation explore loss functions or occlusion masks, and\nthere is little change in model architecture in that ConvNet-based\nencoder-decoder structure becomes a de-facto standard for depth estimation. In\nthis paper, we employ a convolution-free Swin Transformer as an image feature\nextractor so that the network can capture both local geometric features and\nglobal semantic features for depth estimation. Also, we propose a Densely\nCascaded Multi-scale Network (DCMNet) that connects every feature map directly\nwith another from different scales via a top-down cascade pathway. This densely\ncascaded connectivity reinforces the interconnection between decoding layers\nand produces high-quality multi-scale depth outputs.

    "abstract": "Efficient detectors for edge devices are often optimized for metrics like\nparameters or speed counts, which remain weak correlation with the energy of\ndetectors. However, among vision applications of convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs), some, such as always-on surveillance cameras, are critical for energy\nconstraints. This paper aims to serve as a baseline by designing detectors to\nreach tradeoffs between energy and performance from two perspectives: 1) We\nextensively analyze various CNNs to identify low-energy architectures,\nincluding the selection of activation functions, convolutions operators, and\nfeature fusion structures on necks. These underappreciated details in past\nworks seriously affect the energy consumption of detectors; 2) To break through\nthe dilemmatic energy-performance problem, we propose a balanced detector\ndriven by energy using discovered low-energy components named\n\\textit{FemtoDet}. In addition to the novel construction, we further improve\nFemtoDet by considering convolutions and training strategy optimizations.\nSpecifically, we develop a new instance boundary enhancement (IBE) module for\nconvolution optimization to overcome the contradiction between the limited\ncapacity of CNNs and detection tasks in diverse spatial representations, and\npropose a recursive warm-restart (RecWR) for optimizing training strategy to\nescape the sub-optimization of light-weight detectors, considering the data\nshift produced in popular augmentations. As a result, FemtoDet with only 68.77k\nparameters achieves a competitive score of 46.3 AP50 on PASCAL VOC and power of\n7.83W on RTX 3090.

Discovering a fast solution to\nthis problem would also have implications for efforts to develop practical\nimprovements to lexicase selection. Here, I prove that this problem, which I\nname lex-prob, is NP-Hard. I achieve this proof by reducing SAT, a well-known\nNP-Complete problem, to lex-prob in polynomial time. This reduction involves an\nintermediate step in which a popular variant of lexicase selection,\nepsilon-lexicase selection, is reduced to standard lexicase selection. This\nproof has important practical implications for anyone needing a fast way of\ncalculating the probabilities of individual solutions being selected under\nlexicase selection. Doing so in polynomial time would be incredibly\nchallenging, if not all-together impossible.

Many\nexisting approaches have developed sequential and spatiotemporal models, such\nas recurrent neural networks, temporal convolutional networks, and\nthree-dimensional convolutional neural networks, for measuring student\nengagement from videos. These models are trained to incorporate the order of\nbehavioral and emotional states of students into video analysis and output\ntheir level of engagement.

    "abstract": "Previous face inverse rendering methods often require synthetic data with\nground truth and/or professional equipment like a lighting stage. However, a\nmodel trained on synthetic data or using pre-defined lighting priors is\ntypically unable to generalize well for real-world situations, due to the gap\nbetween synthetic data/lighting priors and real data. Furthermore, for common\nusers, the professional equipment and skill make the task expensive and\ncomplex. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework to disentangle\nface images in the wild into their corresponding albedo, normal, and lighting\ncomponents. Specifically, a decomposition network is built with a hierarchical\nsubdivision strategy, which takes image pairs captured from arbitrary\nviewpoints as input. In this way, our approach can greatly mitigate the\npressure from data preparation, and significantly broaden the applicability of\nface inverse rendering.

Usage of subword tokens to build PL and LM, and\ncombining them to form words after decoding, enables the recovery of many out\nof vocabulary words.

    "abstract": "Previous works on emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) follow a two-step\nparadigm, which can be summarized as first producing context-independent\nfeatures via fine-tuning pretrained language models (PLMs) and then analyzing\ncontextual information and dialogue structure information among the extracted\nfeatures. However, we discover that this paradigm has several limitations.\nAccordingly, we propose a novel paradigm, i.e., exploring contextual\ninformation and dialogue structure information in the fine-tuning step, and\nadapting the PLM to the ERC task in terms of input text, classification\nstructure, and training strategy. Furthermore, we develop our model BERT-ERC\naccording to the proposed paradigm, which improves ERC performance in three\naspects, namely suggestive text, fine-grained classification module, and\ntwo-stage training. Compared to existing methods, BERT-ERC achieves substantial\nimprovement on four datasets, indicating its effectiveness and generalization\ncapability. Besides, we also set up the limited resources scenario and the\nonline prediction scenario to approximate real-world scenarios.

We introduce a method for\nanalyzing how a Transformer model processes these inputs by focusing on simple\narithmetic problems and their intermediate values. To trace where information\nabout intermediate values is encoded, we measure the correlation between\nintermediate values and the activations of the model using principal component\nanalysis (PCA).

We identify that the root cause of these weaknesses is a lack of a\nproper treatment for subgraphs. A treatment called Subgraph Centralization for\ngraph anomaly detection is proposed to address all the above weaknesses. Its\nimportance is shown in two ways. First, we present a simple yet effective new\nframework called Graph-Centric Anomaly Detection (GCAD). The key advantages of\nGCAD over existing detectors including deep-learning detectors are: (i) better\nanomaly detection accuracy; (ii) linear time complexity with respect to the\nnumber of nodes; and (iii) it is a generic framework that admits an existing\npoint anomaly detector to be used to detect node anomalies in a network.\nSecond, we show that Subgraph Centralization can be incorporated into two\nexisting detectors to overcome the above-mentioned weaknesses.",

    "abstract": "The increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) has led to the need for\ninstalling public charging stations. Though EVs are mostly charged at the\nresidence, public charging stations are also required for the ease-of-use. The\npublic electric vehicle charging infrastructures (EVCIs) must be equipped with\na good number of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) with fast charging\ncapability to accommodate the EV traffic demand, or else it would lead to\ncongestion at the charging stations. The location of these fast-charging\ninfrastructures significantly impacts the distribution system (DS). We propose\nthe optimal placement of fast-charging EVCIs at different locations in the\ndistribution system so that the power loss and voltage deviations are kept at a\nminimum using multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). Time-series\nanalysis of the distribution and EV load variations are performed using MATLAB\nand OpenDSS. We further analyze the cost benefits of the EVCIs for a real-time\npricing condition and use an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)\nmodel to predict the dynamic price. This allows the charging station operator\nto make promotional offers for maximizing utilization and increasing profits.\nUsing the proposed methods, the results obtained validate the optimal location\nof EVCIs, cost benefits, and dynamic price predictions.",

Various methods have been\nproposed for predicting a post's popularity, i.e., how much engagement (e.g.,\nLikes) it will generate. However, these methods are limited: first, they focus\non forecasting the likes, ignoring the number of comments, which became crucial\nin 2021. Secondly, studies often use biased or limited data. Third, researchers\nfocused on Deep Learning models to increase predictive performance, which are\ndifficult to interpret. As a result, end-users can only estimate engagement\nafter a post is created, which is inefficient and expensive. A better approach\nis to generate a post based on what people and IG like, e.g., by following\nguidelines.\nIn this work, we uncover part of the underlying mechanisms driving IG\nengagement. To achieve this goal, we rely on statistical analysis and\ninterpretable models rather than Deep Learning (black-box) approaches. We\nconduct extensive experiments using a worldwide dataset of 10 million posts\ncreated by 34K global influencers in nine different categories. With our simple\nyet powerful algorithms, we can predict engagement up to 94% of F1-Score,\nmaking us comparable and even superior to Deep Learning-based method.\nFurthermore, we propose a novel unsupervised algorithm for finding highly\nengaging topics on IG.

    "abstract": "We introduce a new Eulerian simulation framework for liquid animation that\nleverages both finite element and finite volume methods. In contrast to\nprevious methods where the whole simulation domain is discretized either using\nthe finite volume method or finite element method, our method spatially merges\nthem together using two types of discretization being tightly coupled on its\nseams while enforcing second order accurate boundary conditions at free\nsurfaces. We achieve our formulation via a variational form using new shape\nfunctions specifically designed for this purpose. By enabling a mixture of the\ntwo methods, we can take advantage of the best of two worlds. For example,\nfinite volume method (FVM) result in sparse linear systems; however, complexity\nis encountered when unstructured grids such as tetrahedral or Voronoi elements\nare used. Finite element method (FEM), on the other hand, result in comparably\ndenser linear systems, but the complexity remains the same even if unstructured\nelements are chosen; thereby facilitating spatial adaptivity. In this paper, we\npropose to use FVM for the majority parts to retain the sparsity of linear\nsystems and FEM for parts where the grid elements are allowed to be freely\ndeformed. An example of this application is locally moving grids. We show that\nby adapting the local grid movement to an underlying nearly rigid motion,\nnumerical diffusion is noticeably reduced; leading to better preservation of\nstructural details such as sharp edges, thin sheets and spindles of liquids.",

However, tactile data is not widely available for robots due\nto their limited reachable space and the restrictions of tactile sensors. To\neliminate the need for tactile data, in this paper we propose a novel method\nnamed as Vis2Hap to generate haptic rendering from visual inputs that can be\nobtained from a distance without physical interaction. We take the surface\ntexture of objects as key cues to be conveyed to the human operator. To this\nend, a generative model is designed to simulate the roughness and slipperiness\nof the object's surface. To embed haptic cues in Vis2Hap, we use height maps\nfrom tactile sensors and spectrograms from friction coefficients as the\nintermediate outputs of the generative model. Once Vis2Hap is trained, it can\nbe used to generate height maps and spectrograms of new surface textures, from\nwhich a friction image can be obtained and displayed on a haptic display. The\nuser study demonstrates that our proposed Vis2Hap method enables users to\naccess a realistic haptic feeling similar to that of physical objects.

Although significant progress has been achieved, existing\napproaches typically suffer from two major limitations: (1) It hurts the\naccuracy of the representation by directly exploiting the bottom-up attention\nbased region-level features where each region is equally treated. (2) It limits\nthe scale of negative sample pairs by employing the mini-batch based end-to-end\ntraining mechanism. To address these limitations, we propose a Unified Semantic\nEnhancement Momentum Contrastive Learning (USER) method for ITR. Specifically,\nwe delicately design two simple but effective Global representation based\nSemantic Enhancement (GSE) modules. One learns the global representation via\nthe self-attention algorithm, noted as Self-Guided Enhancement (SGE) module.\nThe other module benefits from the pre-trained CLIP module, which provides a\nnovel scheme to exploit and transfer the knowledge from an off-the-shelf model,\nnoted as CLIP-Guided Enhancement (CGE) module. Moreover, we incorporate the\ntraining mechanism of MoCo into ITR, in which two dynamic queues are employed\nto enrich and enlarge the scale of negative sample pairs.

    "title": "Algorithms for Acyclic Weighted Finite-State Automata with Failure Arcs",
    "abstract": "Weighted finite-state automata (WSFAs) are commonly used in NLP. Failure\ntransitions are a useful extension for compactly representing backoffs or\ninterpolation in $n$-gram models and CRFs, which are special cases of WFSAs.\nThe pathsum in ordinary acyclic WFSAs is efficiently computed by the backward\nalgorithm in time $O(|E|)$, where $E$ is the set of transitions. However, this\ndoes not allow failure transitions, and preprocessing the WFSA to eliminate\nfailure transitions could greatly increase $|E|$. We extend the backward\nalgorithm to handle failure transitions directly. Our approach is efficient\nwhen the average state has outgoing arcs for only a small fraction $s \\ll 1$ of\nthe alphabet $\\Sigma$. We propose an algorithm for general acyclic WFSAs which\nruns in $O{\\left(|E| + s |\\Sigma| |Q| T_\\text{max} \\log{|\\Sigma|}\\right)}$,\nwhere $Q$ is the set of states and $T_\\text{max}$ is the size of the largest\nconnected component of failure transitions. When the failure transition\ntopology satisfies a condition exemplified by CRFs, the $T_\\text{max}$ factor\ncan be dropped, and when the weight semiring is a ring, the $\\log{|\\Sigma|}$\nfactor can be dropped. In the latter case (ring-weighted acyclic WFSAs), we\nalso give an alternative algorithm with complexity $\\displaystyle O{\\left(|E| +\n|\\Sigma| |Q| \\min(1,s\\pi_\\text{max}) \\right)}$, where $\\pi_\\text{max}$ is the\nsize of the longest failure path.",

    "abstract": "Underwater target localization using range-only and single-beacon (ROSB)\ntechniques with autonomous vehicles has been used recently to improve the\nlimitations of more complex methods, such as long baseline and ultra-short\nbaseline systems. Nonetheless, in ROSB target localization methods, the\ntrajectory of the tracking vehicle near the localized target plays an important\nrole in obtaining the best accuracy of the predicted target position. Here, we\ninvestigate a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to find the optimal path\nthat an autonomous vehicle should follow in order to increase and optimize the\noverall accuracy of the predicted target localization, while reducing time and\npower consumption. To accomplish this objective, different experimental tests\nhave been designed using state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms. Our study also\ncompares the results obtained with the analytical Fisher information matrix\napproach used in previous studies. The results revealed that the policy learned\nby the RL agent outperforms trajectories based on these analytical solutions,\ne.g. the median predicted error at the beginning of the target's localisation\nis 17% less. These findings suggest that using deep RL for localizing acoustic\ntargets could be successfully applied to in-water applications that include\ntracking of acoustically tagged marine animals by autonomous underwater\nvehicles. This is envisioned as a first necessary step to validate the use of\nRL to tackle such problems, which could be used later on in a more complex\nscenarios",

    "abstract": "Existing benchmarks for evaluating long video understanding falls short on\nmultiple aspects, either lacking in scale or quality of annotations. These\nlimitations arise from the difficulty in collecting dense annotations for long\nvideos (e.g. actions, dialogues, etc.), which are often obtained by manually\nlabeling many frames per second. In this work, we introduce an automated\nAnnotation and Video Stream Alignment Pipeline (abbreviated ASAP). We\ndemonstrate the generality of ASAP by aligning unlabeled videos of four\ndifferent sports (Cricket, Football, Basketball, and American Football) with\ntheir corresponding dense annotations (i.e. commentary) freely available on the\nweb. Our human studies indicate that ASAP can align videos and annotations with\nhigh fidelity, precision, and speed. We then leverage ASAP scalability to\ncreate LCric, a large-scale long video understanding benchmark, with over 1000\nhours of densely annotated long Cricket videos (with an average sample length\nof 50 mins) collected at virtually zero annotation cost. We benchmark and\nanalyze state-of-the-art video understanding models on LCric through a large\nset of compositional multi-choice and regression queries.

The configuration\nc has an annihilator if a non-trivial linear combination of finitely many\ntranslations of c is the zero configuration. Writing c as a d-variate formal\npower series, the annihilator is conveniently expressed as a d-variate Laurent\npolynomial f whose formal product with c is the zero power series. More\ngenerally, if the formal product is a strongly periodic configuration, we call\nthe polynomial f a periodizer of c. A common annihilator (periodizer) of a set\nof configurations is called an annihilator (periodizer, respectively) of the\nset. In particular, we consider annihilators and periodizers of d-dimensional\nsubshifts, that is, sets of configurations defined by disallowing some local\npatterns. We show that a (d-1)-dimensional linear subspace S \\subseteq R^d is\nexpansive for a subshift if the subshift has a periodizer whose support\ncontains exactly one element of S. As a subshift is known to be finite if all\n(d-1)-dimensional subspaces are expansive, we obtain a simple necessary\ncondition on the periodizers that guarantees finiteness of a subshift or,\nequivalently, strong periodicity of a configuration.

    "abstract": "Transformer models have achieved promising performances in point cloud\nsegmentation. However, most existing attention schemes provide the same feature\nlearning paradigm for all points equally and overlook the enormous difference\nin size among scene objects. In this paper, we propose the Size-Aware\nTransformer (SAT) that can tailor effective receptive fields for objects of\ndifferent sizes. Our SAT achieves size-aware learning via two steps: introduce\nmulti-scale features to each attention layer and allow each point to choose its\nattentive fields adaptively. It contains two key designs: the Multi-Granularity\nAttention (MGA) scheme and the Re-Attention module. The MGA addresses two\nchallenges: efficiently aggregating tokens from distant areas and preserving\nmulti-scale features within one attention layer. Specifically, point-voxel\ncross attention is proposed to address the first challenge, and the shunted\nstrategy based on the standard multi-head self attention is applied to solve\nthe second. The Re-Attention module dynamically adjusts the attention scores to\nthe fine- and coarse-grained features output by MGA for each point. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that SAT achieves state-of-the-art\nperformances on S3DIS and ScanNetV2 datasets. Our SAT also achieves the most\nbalanced performance on categories among all referred methods, which\nillustrates the superiority of modelling categories of different sizes.

The Iterative scheme\nenables the sharing of features between the two parts of the network at the\nearly stages of training.

    "abstract": "Mean Field Control (MFC) is a powerful approximation tool to solve\nlarge-scale Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problems. However, the\nsuccess of MFC relies on the presumption that given the local states and\nactions of all the agents, the next (local) states of the agents evolve\nconditionally independent of each other. Here we demonstrate that even in a\nMARL setting where agents share a common global state in addition to their\nlocal states evolving conditionally independently (thus introducing a\ncorrelation between the state transition processes of individual agents), the\nMFC can still be applied as a good approximation tool. The global state is\nassumed to be non-decomposable i.e., it cannot be expressed as a collection of\nlocal states of the agents. We compute the approximation error as\n$\\mathcal{O}(e)$ where $e=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\left[\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{X}|}\n+\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{U}|}\\right]$. The size of the agent population is denoted by\nthe term $N$, and $|\\mathcal{X}|, |\\mathcal{U}|$ respectively indicate the\nsizes of (local) state and action spaces of individual agents. The\napproximation error is found to be independent of the size of the shared global\nstate space. We further demonstrate that in a special case if the reward and\nstate transition functions are independent of the action distribution of the\npopulation, then the error can be improved to\n$e=\\frac{\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{X}|}}{\\sqrt{N}}$. Finally, we devise a Natural Policy\nGradient based algorithm that solves the MFC problem with\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$ sample complexity and obtains a policy that is\nwithin $\\mathcal{O}(\\max\\{e,\\epsilon\\})$ error of the optimal MARL policy for\nany $\\epsilon>0$.",

    "abstract": "Traditional segmentation methods for colonic polyps are mainly designed based\non low-level features. They could not accurately extract the location of small\ncolonic polyps. Although the existing deep learning methods can improve the\nsegmentation accuracy, their effects are still unsatisfied. To meet the above\nchallenges, we propose a hybrid network called Fusion-Transformer-HardNetMSEG\n(i.e., Fu-TransHNet) in this study. Fu-TransHNet uses deep learning of\ndifferent mechanisms to fuse each other and is enhanced with multi-view\ncollaborative learning techniques. Firstly, the Fu-TransHNet utilizes the\nTransformer branch and the CNN branch to realize the global feature learning\nand local feature learning, respectively. Secondly, a fusion module is designed\nto integrate the features from two branches. The fusion module consists of two\nparts: 1) the Global-Local Feature Fusion (GLFF) part and 2) the Dense Fusion\nof Multi-scale features (DFM) part. The former is built to compensate the\nfeature information mission from two branches at the same scale; the latter is\nconstructed to enhance the feature representation. Thirdly, the above two\nbranches and fusion modules utilize multi-view cooperative learning techniques\nto obtain their respective weights that denote their importance and then make a\nfinal decision comprehensively. Experimental results showed that the\nFu-TransHNet network was superior to the existing methods on five widely used\nbenchmark datasets. In particular, on the ETIS-LaribPolypDB dataset containing\nmany small-target colonic polyps, the mDice obtained by Fu-TransHNet were 12.4%\nand 6.2% higher than the state-of-the-art methods HardNet-MSEG and TransFuse-s,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "The position and the orientation of a rigid body object pushed by a robot on\na planar surface are extremely difficult to predict. In this paper, the\nprediction problem is formulated as a disturbance observer design problem. The\ndisturbance observer provides accurate estimation of the total sum of model\nerrors and external disturbances acting on the object. From the estimation\nresults, it is revealed that there is a strong linear relationship between the\napplied force or torque and the estimated disturbances. The proposed prediction\nalgorithm has two phases: the identification & the prediction.

    "abstract": "Curve-based methods are one of the classic lane detection methods. They learn\nthe holistic representation of lane lines, which is intuitive and concise.\nHowever, their performance lags behind the recent state-of-the-art methods due\nto the limitation of their lane representation and optimization. In this paper,\nwe revisit the curve-based lane detection methods from the perspectives of the\nlane representations' globality and locality. The globality of lane\nrepresentation is the ability to complete invisible parts of lanes with visible\nparts. The locality of lane representation is the ability to modify lanes\nlocally which can simplify parameter optimization. Specifically, we first\npropose to exploit the b-spline curve to fit lane lines since it meets the\nlocality and globality. Second, we design a simple yet efficient network BSNet\nto ensure the acquisition of global and local features. Third, we propose a new\ncurve distance to make the lane detection optimization objective more\nreasonable and alleviate ill-conditioned problems. The proposed methods achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on the Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS datasets,\nwhich dramatically improved the accuracy of curve-based methods in the lane\ndetection task while running far beyond real-time (197FPS).",

    "abstract": "Speech patterns have been identified as potential diagnostic markers for\nneuropsychiatric conditions. However, most studies only compare a single\nclinical group to healthy controls, whereas clinical practice often requires\ndifferentiating between multiple potential diagnoses (multiclass settings). To\naddress this, we assembled a dataset of repeated recordings from 420\nparticipants (67 with major depressive disorder, 106 with schizophrenia and 46\nwith autism, as well as matched controls), and tested the performance of a\nrange of conventional machine learning models and advanced Transformer models\non both binary and multiclass classification, based on voice and text features.\nWhile binary models performed comparably to previous research (F1 scores\nbetween 0.54-0.75 for autism spectrum disorder, ASD; 0.67-0.92 for major\ndepressive disorder, MDD; and 0.71-0.83 for schizophrenia); when\ndifferentiating between multiple diagnostic groups performance decreased\nmarkedly (F1 scores between 0.35-0.44 for ASD, 0.57-0.75 for MDD, 0.15-0.66 for\nschizophrenia, and 0.38-0.52 macro F1). Combining voice and text-based models\nyielded increased performance, suggesting that they capture complementary\ndiagnostic information.\nOur results indicate that models trained on binary classification may learn\nto rely on markers of generic differences between clinical and non-clinical\npopulations, or markers of clinical features that overlap across conditions,\nrather than identifying markers specific to individual conditions. We provide\nrecommendations for future research in the field, suggesting increased focus on\ndeveloping larger transdiagnostic datasets that include more fine-grained\nclinical features, and that can support the development of models that better\ncapture the complexity of neuropsychiatric conditions and naturalistic\ndiagnostic assessment.",

This\nversatility benefits large-scale space-frame structures, as the individual\ndesign of each structural node can be tailored to meet specific mechanical and\nother functional requirements. To this end, however, the design and analysis of\nsuch space-frames with distinct structural nodes needs to be highly automated.\nA critical aspect in this context is automated integration of the local 3D\nfeatures into the 1D large-scale models. In the present work, a two-scale\nmodeling approach is developed to improve the design and linear-elastic\nanalysis of space frames with complex additively manufactured nodes. The\nmechanical characteristics of the 3D nodes are numerically reduced through an\nautomated dimensional reduction process based on the Finite Cell Method (FCM)\nand substructuring. The reduced stiffness quantities are assembled in the\nlarge-scale 1D model which, in turn, enables efficient structural analysis. The\nresponse of the 1D model is passed on to the local model, enabling fully\nresolved 3D linear-elastic analysis. The proposed approach is numerically\nverified on a simplified beam example. Furthermore, the workflow is\ndemonstrated on a tree canopy structure with additively manufactured nodes with\nbolted connections. The form of the large-scale structure is found based on the\nCombinatorial Equilibrium Modeling framework, and the different designs of the\nlocal structural nodes are based on generative exploration of the design space.\nIt is demonstrated that the proposed methodology effectively automates the\ndesign and analysis of space-frame structures with complex, distinct structural\nnodes.",

Recent machine learning\napproaches to ToM have demonstrated that we can train the observer to read the\npast and present behaviours of other agents and infer their beliefs (including\nfalse beliefs about things that no longer exist), goals, intentions and future\nactions. The challenges arise when the behavioural space is complex, demanding\nskilful space navigation for rapidly changing contexts for an extended period.\nWe tackle the challenges by equipping the observer with novel neural memory\nmechanisms to encode, and hierarchical attention to selectively retrieve\ninformation about others. The memories allow rapid, selective querying of\ndistal related past behaviours of others to deliberatively reason about their\ncurrent mental state, beliefs and future behaviours. This results in ToMMY, a\ntheory of mind model that learns to reason while making little assumptions\nabout the underlying mental processes. We also construct a new suite of\nexperiments to demonstrate that memories facilitate the learning process and\nachieve better theory of mind performance, especially for high-demand\nfalse-belief tasks that require inferring through multiple steps of changes.",

Trust functions to reduce the effort spent in constantly\nmonitoring others' actions in order to verify their assertions, thus\nfacilitating cooperation by allowing groups to function with reduced\ncomplexity. To date, in modern societies, large scale trust is almost\nexclusively provided by large centralized institutions. Specifically in the\ncase of the Internet, Big Tech companies maintain the largest Internet\nplatforms where users can interact, transact and share information. Thus, they\ncontrol who can interact and conduct transactions through their monopoly of\nonline trust. However, as recent events have shown, allowing for-profit\ncorporations to act as gatekeepers to the online world comes with a litany of\nproblems. While so far ecosystems of trust on the Internet could only be\nfeasibly created by large institutions, Web3 proponents have a vision of the\nInternet where trust is generated without centralised actors. They attempt to\ndo so by creating an ecosystem of trust constructed using decentralised\ntechnology. This survey explores this elusive goal of Web3 to create a\n\"Universal Trust Machine\", which in a true decentralised paradigm would be\nowned by both nobody and everybody. In order to do so, we first motivate the\ndecades-old problem of generating trust without an intermediary by discussing\nRobert Axelrod's research on the evolution of cooperation. Next, we present the\nchallenges that would have to be overcome in order to enable long term\ncooperation.

    "abstract": "Inspired by the success of recent vision transformers and large kernel design\nin convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in this paper, we analyze and explore\nessential reasons for their success. We claim two factors that are critical for\n3D large-scale scene understanding: a larger receptive field and operations\nwith greater non-linearity. The former is responsible for providing long range\ncontexts and the latter can enhance the capacity of the network. To achieve the\nabove properties, we propose a simple yet effective long range pooling (LRP)\nmodule using dilation max pooling, which provides a network with a large\nadaptive receptive field. LRP has few parameters, and can be readily added to\ncurrent CNNs. Also, based on LRP, we present an entire network architecture,\nLRPNet, for 3D understanding. Ablation studies are presented to support our\nclaims, and show that the LRP module achieves better results than large kernel\nconvolution yet with reduced computation, due to its nonlinearity. We also\ndemonstrate the superiority of LRPNet on various benchmarks: LRPNet performs\nthe best on ScanNet and surpasses other CNN-based methods on S3DIS and\nMatterport3D.

There has been a lot of research on dynamic\nalgorithms for graph problems that are solvable in polynomial time by a static\nalgorithm. However, while there is a large body of theoretical work on\nefficient dynamic graph algorithms, a lot of these algorithms were never\nimplemented and empirically evaluated. In this work, we consider the fully\ndynamic edge orientation problem, also called fully dynamic\n$\\Delta$-orientation problem, which is to maintain an orientation of the edges\nof an undirected graph such that the out-degree is low. If edges are inserted\nor deleted, one may have to flip the orientation of some edges in order to\navoid vertices having a large out-degree. While there has been theoretical work\non dynamic versions of this problem, currently there is no experimental\nevaluation available. In this work, we close this gap and engineer a range of\nnew dynamic edge orientation algorithms as well as algorithms from the current\nliterature. Moreover, we evaluate these algorithms on real-world dynamic\ngraphs. The best algorithm considered in this paper in terms of quality, based\non a simple breadth-first search, computes the optimum result more than 90% of\nthe instances and is on average only 2.4% worse than the optimum solution.",

On LCP-type applications, DBP reduces the worst-case connectivity\nrequirement of W-MSR from (2F+1)-connected to (F+1)-connected and the number of\ncooperative observers required to propagate new information from F+1 to just 1\nobserver.

With the goal of minimizing\nthis gap on resource-constrained embedded systems, we train and live-adapt\nagents on quadrotors built from off-the-shelf hardware. In achieving this we\ndeveloped three novel contributions. (i) SwaNNFlight, an open-source firmware\nenabling wireless data capture and transfer of agents' observations.\nFine-tuning agents with new data, and receiving and swapping onboard NN\ncontrollers -- all while in flight. We also design SwaNNFlight System (SwaNNFS)\nallowing new research in training and live-adapting learning agents on similar\nsystems. (ii) Multiplicative value composition, a technique for preserving the\nimportance of each policy optimization criterion, improving training\nperformance and variability in learnt behavior. And (iii) anchor critics to\nhelp stabilize the fine-tuning of agents during sim-to-real transfer, online\nlearning from real data while retaining behavior optimized in simulation. We\ntrain consistently flight-worthy control policies in simulation and deploy them\non real quadrotors. We then achieve live controller adaptation via over-the-air\nupdates of the onboard control policy from a ground station.

    "title": "Dataset Distillation: A Comprehensive Review",
    "abstract": "Recent success of deep learning can be largely attributed to the huge amount\nof data used for training deep neural networks. However, the sheer amount of\ndata significantly increase the burden on storage and transmission. It would\nalso consume considerable time and computational resources to train models on\nsuch large datasets. Moreover, directly publishing raw data inevitably raise\nconcerns on privacy and copyright. Focusing on these inconveniences, dataset\ndistillation (DD), also known as dataset condensation (DC), has become a\npopular research topic in recent years. Given an original large dataset, DD\naims at a much smaller dataset containing several synthetic samples, such that\nmodels trained on the synthetic dataset can have comparable performance with\nthose trained on the original real one. This paper presents a comprehensive\nreview and summary for recent advances in DD and its application. We first\nintroduce the task in formal and propose an overall algorithmic framework\nfollowed by all existing DD methods. Then, we provide a systematic taxonomy of\ncurrent methodologies in this area. Their theoretical relationship will also be\ndiscussed. We also point out current challenges in DD through extensive\nexperiments and envision possible directions for future works.",

    "abstract": "Accurate bot detection is necessary for the safety and integrity of online\nplatforms. It is also crucial for research on the influence of bots in\nelections, the spread of misinformation, and financial market manipulation.\nPlatforms deploy infrastructure to flag or remove automated accounts, but their\ntools and data are not publicly available. Thus, the public must rely on\nthird-party bot detection. These tools employ machine learning and often\nachieve near perfect performance for classification on existing datasets,\nsuggesting bot detection is accurate, reliable and fit for use in downstream\napplications. We provide evidence that this is not the case and show that high\nperformance is attributable to limitations in dataset collection and labeling\nrather than sophistication of the tools. Specifically, we show that simple\ndecision rules -- shallow decision trees trained on a small number of features\n-- achieve near-state-of-the-art performance on most available datasets and\nthat bot detection datasets, even when combined together, do not generalize\nwell to out-of-sample datasets. Our findings reveal that predictions are highly\ndependent on each dataset's collection and labeling procedures rather than\nfundamental differences between bots and humans. These results have important\nimplications for both transparency in sampling and labeling procedures and\npotential biases in research using existing bot detection tools for\npre-processing.",

Aquarium achieves stable simulation with accurate flow\nphysics by integrating over the discrete, incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations directly using a fully-implicit Crank-Nicolson scheme with a\nsecond-order finite-volume spatial discretization. The robot and fluid physics\nare coupled using the immersed boundary method by formulating the no-slip\ncondition as an equality constraint applied directly to the Navier-Stokes\nsystem. This choice of coupling allows the fluid-structure interaction to be\nposed and solved as a nonlinear optimization problem. This optimization-based\nformulation is then exploited using the implicit-function theorem to compute\nderivatives. The derivatives can then be passed to a gradient-based\noptimization or learning framework. We demonstrate Aquarium's ability to\naccurately simulate coupled fluid-solid physics with numerous examples,\nincluding a cylinder in free stream and a soft robotic tail with hardware\nvalidation.

These\nusers are grouped into \\emph{latent} clusters such that the mean reward vectors\nof users within the same cluster are identical. At each round, a user, selected\nuniformly at random, pulls an arm and observes a corresponding noisy reward.\nThe goal of the users is to maximize their cumulative rewards. This problem is\ncentral to practical recommendation systems and has received wide attention of\nlate \\cite{gentile2014online, maillard2014latent}. Now, if each user acts\nindependently, then they would have to explore each arm independently and a\nregret of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\mathsf{MNT}})$ is unavoidable, where $\\mathsf{M},\n\\mathsf{N}$ are the number of arms and users, respectively.

However,\nthe same malleability that enables homomorphic computations also raises\nintegrity issues, which have so far been mostly overlooked. While FHEs lack of\nintegrity has obvious implications for correctness, it also has severe\nimplications for confidentiality: a malicious server can leverage the lack of\nintegrity to carry out interactive key-recovery attacks. As a result, virtually\nall FHE schemes and applications assume an honest-but-curious server who does\nnot deviate from the protocol.

    "abstract": "Objective: To develop and validate a deep learning model for the\nidentification of out-of-body images in endoscopic videos. Background: Surgical\nvideo analysis facilitates education and research. However, video recordings of\nendoscopic surgeries can contain privacy-sensitive information, especially if\nout-of-body scenes are recorded. Therefore, identification of out-of-body\nscenes in endoscopic videos is of major importance to preserve the privacy of\npatients and operating room staff. Methods: A deep learning model was trained\nand evaluated on an internal dataset of 12 different types of laparoscopic and\nrobotic surgeries. External validation was performed on two independent\nmulticentric test datasets of laparoscopic gastric bypass and cholecystectomy\nsurgeries. All images extracted from the video datasets were annotated as\ninside or out-of-body. Model performance was evaluated compared to human ground\ntruth annotations measuring the receiver operating characteristic area under\nthe curve (ROC AUC). Results: The internal dataset consisting of 356,267 images\nfrom 48 videos and the two multicentric test datasets consisting of 54,385 and\n58,349 images from 10 and 20 videos, respectively, were annotated.

    "abstract": "Research on prompting has shown excellent performance with little or even no\nsupervised training across many tasks. However, prompting for machine\ntranslation is still under-explored in the literature. We fill this gap by\noffering a systematic study on prompting strategies for translation, examining\nvarious factors for prompt template and demonstration example selection. We\nfurther explore the use of monolingual data and the feasibility of\ncross-lingual, cross-domain, and sentence-to-document transfer learning in\nprompting. Extensive experiments with GLM-130B (Zeng et al., 2022) as the\ntestbed show that 1) the number and the quality of prompt examples matter,\nwhere using suboptimal examples degenerates translation; 2) several features of\nprompt examples, such as semantic similarity, show significant Spearman\ncorrelation with their prompting performance; yet, none of the correlations are\nstrong enough; 3) using pseudo parallel prompt examples constructed from\nmonolingual data via zero-shot prompting could improve translation; and 4)\nimproved performance is achievable by transferring knowledge from prompt\nexamples selected in other settings. We finally provide an analysis on the\nmodel outputs and discuss several problems that prompting still suffers from.",

    "abstract": "Segmentation is one of the primary tasks in the application of deep learning\nin medical imaging, owing to its multiple downstream clinical applications. As\na result, many large-scale segmentation datasets have been curated and released\nfor the segmentation of different anatomical structures. However, these\ndatasets focus on the segmentation of a subset of anatomical structures in the\nbody, therefore, training a model for each dataset would potentially result in\nhundreds of models and thus limit their clinical translational utility.\nFurthermore, many of these datasets share the same field of view but have\ndifferent subsets of annotations, thus making individual dataset annotations\nincomplete. To that end, we developed SegViz, a federated learning framework\nfor aggregating knowledge from distributed medical image segmentation datasets\nwith different and incomplete annotations into a `global` meta-model. The\nSegViz framework was trained to build a single model capable of segmenting both\nliver and spleen aggregating knowledge from both these nodes by aggregating the\nweights after every 10 epochs. The global SegViz model was tested on an\nexternal dataset, Beyond the Cranial Vault (BTCV), comprising both liver and\nspleen annotations using the dice similarity (DS) metric. The baseline\nindividual segmentation models for spleen and liver trained on their respective\ndatasets produced a DS score of 0.834 and 0.878 on the BTCV test set. In\ncomparison, the SegViz model produced comparable mean DS scores of 0.829 and\n0.899 for the segmentation of the spleen and liver respectively. Our results\ndemonstrate SegViz as an essential first step towards training clinically\ntranslatable multi-task segmentation models from distributed datasets with\ndisjoint incomplete annotations with excellent performance.",

    "abstract": "Prompts have been the center of progress in advancing language models'\nzero-shot and few-shot performance. However, recent work finds that models can\nperform surprisingly well when given intentionally irrelevant or misleading\nprompts. Such results may be interpreted as evidence that model behavior is not\n\"human like\". In this study, we challenge a central assumption in such work:\nthat humans would perform badly when given pathological instructions. We find\nthat humans are able to reliably ignore irrelevant instructions and thus, like\nmodels, perform well on the underlying task despite an apparent lack of signal\nregarding the task they are being asked to do. However, when given deliberately\nmisleading instructions, humans follow the instructions faithfully, whereas\nmodels do not. Thus, our conclusion is mixed with respect to prior work. We\nargue against the earlier claim that high performance with irrelevant prompts\nconstitutes evidence against models' instruction understanding, but we\nreinforce the claim that models' failure to follow misleading instructions\nraises concerns. More broadly, we caution that future research should not\nidealize human behaviors as a monolith and should not train or evaluate models\nto mimic assumptions about these behaviors without first validating humans'\nbehaviors empirically.",

    "abstract": "With recent advancements in the area of Natural Language Processing, the\nfocus is slowly shifting from a purely English-centric view towards more\nlanguage-specific solutions, including German. Especially practical for\nbusinesses to analyze their growing amount of textual data are text\nsummarization systems, which transform long input documents into compressed and\nmore digestible summary texts. In this work, we assess the particular landscape\nof German abstractive text summarization and investigate the reasons why\npractically useful solutions for abstractive text summarization are still\nabsent in industry. Our focus is two-fold, analyzing a) training resources, and\nb) publicly available summarization systems. We are able to show that popular\nexisting datasets exhibit crucial flaws in their assumptions about the original\nsources, which frequently leads to detrimental effects on system generalization\nand evaluation biases. We confirm that for the most popular training dataset,\nMLSUM, over 50% of the training set is unsuitable for abstractive summarization\npurposes. Furthermore, available systems frequently fail to compare to simple\nbaselines, and ignore more effective and efficient extractive summarization\napproaches. We attribute poor evaluation quality to a variety of different\nfactors, which are investigated in more detail in this work: A lack of\nqualitative (and diverse) gold data considered for training, understudied (and\nuntreated) positional biases in some of the existing datasets, and the lack of\neasily accessible and streamlined pre-processing strategies or analysis tools.\nWe provide a comprehensive assessment of available models on the cleaned\ndatasets, and find that this can lead to a reduction of more than 20 ROUGE-1\npoints during evaluation.

    "abstract": "In many scientific research and engineering applications where repeated\nsimulations of complex systems are conducted, a surrogate is commonly adopted\nto quickly estimate the whole system. To reduce the expensive cost of\ngenerating training examples, it has become a promising approach to combine the\nresults of low-fidelity (fast but inaccurate) and high-fidelity (slow but\naccurate) simulations. Despite the fast developments of multi-fidelity fusion\ntechniques, most existing methods require particular data structures and do not\nscale well to high-dimensional output. To resolve these issues, we generalize\nthe classic autoregression (AR), which is wildly used due to its simplicity,\nrobustness, accuracy, and tractability, and propose generalized autoregression\n(GAR) using tensor formulation and latent features. GAR can deal with arbitrary\ndimensional outputs and arbitrary multifidelity data structure to satisfy the\ndemand of multi-fidelity fusion for complex problems; it admits a fully\ntractable likelihood and posterior requiring no approximate inference and\nscales well to high-dimensional problems. Furthermore, we prove the\nautokrigeability theorem based on GAR in the multi-fidelity case and develop\nCIGAR, a simplified GAR with the exact predictive mean accuracy with\ncomputation reduction by a factor of d 3, where d is the dimensionality of the\noutput. The empirical assessment includes many canonical PDEs and real\nscientific examples and demonstrates that the proposed method consistently\noutperforms the SOTA methods with a large margin (up to 6x improvement in RMSE)\nwith only a couple high-fidelity training samples.",

To this end, we consider a multimodal\ntransportation network, where a ride-hailing platform operates a fleet of AVs\nto offer mobility-on-demand services in competition with a public transit\nagency that offers transit services on a transportation network. A\ngame-theoretic model is developed to characterize the intimate interactions\nbetween the ride-hailing platform, the transit agency, and multiclass\npassengers with distinct income levels. An algorithm is proposed to compute the\nNash equilibrium of the game and conduct an ex-post evaluation of the\nperformance of the obtained solution. Based on the proposed framework, we\nevaluate the spatial and social equity in transport accessibility using Theil\nindex, and find that although the proliferation of for-hire AVs in the\nride-hailing network improves overall accessibility, the benefits are not\nfairly distributed among distinct locations or population groups, implying that\nthe deployment of AVs will enlarge the existing spatial and social inequity\ngaps in the transportation network if no regulatory intervention is in place.\nTo address this concern, we investigate two regulatory policies that can\nimprove transport equity: (a) a minimum service-level requirement on\nride-hailing service, which improves the spatial equity in the transport\nnetwork; (b) a subsidy on ride-hailing trips that serve as first/last-mile\nconnection to public transit, which promotes the use of public transit and\nimproves the social equity of the transport network. We show that the minimum\nservice-level requirement entails a trade-off: as a higher minimum service\nlevel is imposed, the spatial inequity reduces, but the social inequity will be\nexacerbated.

    "title": "Modulation spectral features for speech emotion recognition using deep  neural networks",
    "abstract": "This work explores the use of constant-Q transform based modulation spectral\nfeatures (CQT-MSF) for speech emotion recognition (SER). The human perception\nand analysis of sound comprise of two important cognitive parts: early auditory\nanalysis and cortex-based processing. The early auditory analysis considers\nspectrogram-based representation whereas cortex-based analysis includes\nextraction of temporal modulations from the spectrogram. This temporal\nmodulation representation of spectrogram is called modulation spectral feature\n(MSF). As the constant-Q transform (CQT) provides higher resolution at emotion\nsalient low-frequency regions of speech, we find that CQT-based spectrogram,\ntogether with its temporal modulations, provides a representation enriched with\nemotion-specific information. We argue that CQT-MSF when used with a\n2-dimensional convolutional network can provide a time-shift invariant and\ndeformation insensitive representation for SER. Our results show that CQT-MSF\noutperforms standard mel-scale based spectrogram and its modulation features on\ntwo popular SER databases, Berlin EmoDB and RAVDESS. We also show that our\nproposed feature outperforms the shift and deformation invariant scattering\ntransform coefficients, hence, showing the importance of joint hand-crafted and\nself-learned feature extraction instead of reliance on complete hand-crafted\nfeatures. Finally, we perform Grad-CAM analysis to visually inspect the\ncontribution of constant-Q modulation features over SER.",

However, existing kernel\ntests either run in $n^2$ time or sacrifice undue power to improve runtime. To\naddress these shortcomings, we introduce Compress Then Test (CTT), a new\nframework for high-powered kernel testing based on sample compression. CTT\ncheaply approximates an expensive test by compressing each $n$ point sample\ninto a small but provably high-fidelity coreset. For standard kernels and\nsubexponential distributions, CTT inherits the statistical behavior of a\nquadratic-time test -- recovering the same optimal detection boundary -- while\nrunning in near-linear time. We couple these advances with cheaper permutation\ntesting, justified by new power analyses; improved time-vs.-quality guarantees\nfor low-rank approximation; and a fast aggregation procedure for identifying\nespecially discriminating kernels.

The principal component reduced Gaussian\nmixture model was implemented to investigate the geographic distribution of the\nsurface units across the dwarf planet. We also present the likelihood of each\nsurface unit at the image pixel level. Average I/F spectra of each unit were\nanalyzed -- in terms of the position and strengths of absorption bands of\nabundant volatiles such as N${}_{2}$, CH${}_{4}$, and CO and nonvolatile\nH${}_{2}$O -- to connect the unit to surface composition, geology, and\ngeographic location. The distribution of surface units shows a latitudinal\npattern with distinct surface compositions of volatiles -- consistent with the\nexisting literature. However, previous mapping efforts were based primarily on\ncompositional analysis using spectral indices (indicators) or implementation of\ncomplex radiative transfer models, which need (prior) expert knowledge, label\ndata, or optical constants of representative endmembers. We prove that an\napplication of unsupervised learning in this instance renders a satisfactory\nresult in mapping the spatial distribution of ice compositions without any\nprior information or label data. Thus, such an application is specifically\nadvantageous for a planetary surface mapping when label data are poorly\nconstrained or completely unknown, because an understanding of surface material\ndistribution is vital for volatile transport modeling at the planetary scale.\nWe emphasize that the unsupervised learning used in this study has wide\napplicability and can be expanded to other planetary bodies of the Solar System\nfor mapping surface material distribution.",

To enhance the noise\nadaptation capability of current methods, we first resort to the weighted HSI\ndenoising model since its weight is capable of characterizing the noise in\ndifferent positions of the image. However, the weight in these weighted models\nis always determined by an empirical updating formula, which does not fully\nutilize the noise information contained in noisy images and thus limits their\nperformance improvement. In this work, we propose an automatic weighting scheme\nto alleviate this issue. Specifically, the weight in the weighted model is\npredicted by a hyper-weight network (i.e., HWnet), which can be learned in a\nbi-level optimization framework based on the data-driven methodology. The\nlearned HWnet can be explicitly plugged into other weighted denoising models,\nand help adjust weights for different noisy HSIs and different weighted models.\nExtensive experiments verify that the proposed HWnet can help improve the\ngeneralization ability of a weighted model to adapt to more complex noise, and\ncan also strengthen the weighted model by transferring the knowledge from\nanother weighted model. Additionally, to explain the experimental results, we\nalso theoretically prove the training error and generalization error upper\nbound of the proposed HWnet, which should be the first generalization error\nanalysis in the low-level vision field as far as we know.",

    "abstract": "Optimization problems are a staple of today's scientific and technical\nlandscape. However, at present, solvers of such problems are almost exclusively\nrun on digital hardware. Using Turing machines as a mathematical model for any\ntype of digital hardware, in this paper, we analyze fundamental limitations of\nthis conceptual approach of solving optimization problems. Since in most\napplications, the optimizer itself is of significantly more interest than the\noptimal value of the corresponding function, we will focus on computability of\nthe optimizer. In fact, we will show that in various situations the optimizer\nis unattainable on Turing machines and consequently on digital computers.\nMoreover, even worse, there does not exist a Turing machine, which approximates\nthe optimizer itself up to a certain constant error. We prove such results for\na variety of well-known problems from very different areas, including\nartificial intelligence, financial mathematics, and information theory, often\nderiving the even stronger result that such problems are not Banach-Mazur\ncomputable, also not even in an approximate sense.",

    "title": "Cell-Free Massive MIMO in O-RAN: Energy-Aware Joint Orchestration of  Cloud, Fronthaul, and Radio Resources",
    "abstract": "The physical-layer foundations of cell-free massive MIMO are now\nwell-established. The end-to-end network (from radio site to the cloud)\nanalysis and energy-efficient operation are two critical factors to be\nconsidered for the deployment of cell-free massive MIMO functionality in a\npractical wireless network architecture. In line with the cloudification and\nvirtualization in the open radio access networks (O-RAN), it is indisputable to\nenvision prospective cell-free infrastructure on top of the O-RAN architecture.\nO-RAN is the key enabler for the end-to-end management of cell-free massive\nMIMO. In this paper, we explore the performance and power consumption of\ndifferent radio technologies, i.e., cell-free massive MIMO and traditional\nsmall-cell systems, in the virtualized O-RAN architecture from an end-to-end\nperspective. We compare two different functional split options and different\nresource orchestration mechanisms, including the fully virtualized end-to-end,\nlocal cloud coordination-based, and radio-only resource allocation. In the\nend-to-end orchestration scheme, we aim to minimize the end-to-end power\nconsumption by jointly allocating the radio, optical fronthaul, and virtualized\ncloud processing resources. We compare end-to-end orchestration with two other\nschemes: i)``radio-only'' where radio resources are optimized independently\nfrom the cloud and ii)``local cloud coordination'' where orchestration is only\nallowed among a local cluster of radio units. The spectral efficiency (SE) is\neither considered as an optimization constraint for each user equipment or as a\nsum SE in the objective function. We develop several algorithms to solve the\nrespective end-to-end optimization problems.",

At present, machine\nlearning-based methodologies are gaining popularity as a means of predicting\nbinding affinity due to their efficiency and accuracy, as well as the\nincreasing availability of structural and binding affinity data for\nprotein-ligand complexes. In biomolecular studies, graph theory has been widely\napplied since graphs can be used to model molecules or molecular complexes in a\nnatural manner. In the present work, we upgrade the graph-based learners for\nthe study of protein-ligand interactions by integrating extensive atom types\nsuch as SYBYL and extended connectivity interactive features (ECIF) into\nmultiscale weighted colored graphs (MWCG). By pairing with the gradient\nboosting decision tree (GBDT) machine learning algorithm, our approach results\nin two different methods, namely $^\\text{sybyl}\\text{GGL}$-Score and\n$^\\text{ecif}\\text{GGL}$-Score.

    "abstract": "Fourier transformations of pseudo-Boolean functions are popular tools for\nanalyzing functions of binary sequences. Real-world functions often have\nstructures that manifest in a sparse Fourier transform, and previous works have\nshown that under the assumption of sparsity the transform can be computed\nefficiently. But what if we want to compute the Fourier transform of functions\ndefined over a $q$-ary alphabet? These types of functions arise naturally in\nmany areas including biology. A typical workaround is to encode the $q$-ary\nsequence in binary, however, this approach is computationally inefficient and\nfundamentally incompatible with the existing sparse Fourier transform\ntechniques. Herein, we develop a sparse Fourier transform algorithm\nspecifically for $q$-ary functions of length $n$ sequences, dubbed $q$-SFT,\nwhich provably computes an $S$-sparse transform with vanishing error as $q^n\n\\rightarrow \\infty$ in $O(Sn)$ function evaluations and $O(S n^2 \\log q)$\ncomputations, where $S = q^{n\\delta}$ for some $\\delta < 1$. Under certain\nassumptions, we show that for fixed $q$, a robust version of $q$-SFT has a\nsample complexity of $O(Sn^2)$ and a computational complexity of $O(Sn^3)$ with\nthe same asymptotic guarantees. We present numerical simulations on synthetic\nand real-world RNA data, demonstrating the scalability of $q$-SFT to massively\nhigh dimensional $q$-ary functions.",

    "abstract": "General distribution steering is intrinsically an infinite-dimensional\nproblem, where the distributions to steer are arbitrary. In the literature, the\ndistribution steering problem governed by system dynamics is usually treated by\nassuming the distribution of the system states to be Gaussian. In our previous\npaper, we considered the distribution steering problem where the initial and\nterminal distributions are arbitrary (only required to have first several\norders of power moments), and proposed to use the moments to turn this problem\ninto a finite-dimensional one. We put forward a moment representation of the\nprimal system for control. However, the control law in that paper was an\nempirical one without optimization towards a design criterion, which doesn't\nalways ensure a most satisfactory solution. In this paper, which is a very\npreliminary version, we propose a convex optimization approach to the general\ndistribution steering problem of the first-order discrete-time linear system,\ni.e., an optimal control law for the corresponding moment system. The optimal\ncontrol inputs of the moment system are obtained by convex optimization, of\nwhich the convexity of the domain is proved. An algorithm of distribution\nsteering is then put forward by extending a realization scheme of control\ninputs using the Kullback-Leibler distance to one realization using the squared\nHellinger distance, of which the performance has been shown to be better than\nthe former one. Experiments on different types of cost functions are given to\nvalidate the performance of our proposed algorithm. Since the moment system is\na dimension-reduced counterpart of the primal system, and we are not optimizing\nthe cost function over all feasible control inputs, we call this solution a\nsub-optimal one to the primal general distribution steering problem.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider passive RIS-assisted multi-user communication\nbetween wireless nodes to improve the blocked line-of-sight (LOS) link\nperformance. The wireless nodes are assumed to be equipped with Massive\nMultiple-Input Multiple-Output antennas, hybrid precoder, combiner, and\nlow-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). We first derive the\nexpression for the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the Mean Squared Error\n(MSE) of the received and combined signal at the intended receiver under\ninterference. By appropriate design of the hybrid precoder, combiner, and RIS\nphase settings, it can be shown that the MSE achieves the CRLB. We further show\nthat minimizing the MSE w.r.t. the phase settings of the RIS is equivalent to\nmaximizing the throughput and energy efficiency of the system. We then propose\na novel Information-Directed Branch-and-Prune (IDBP) algorithm to derive the\nphase settings of the RIS. We, for the first time in the literature, use an\ninformation-theoretic measure to decide on the pruning rules in a tree-search\nalgorithm to arrive at the RIS phase-setting solution, which is vastly\ndifferent compared to the traditional branch-and-bound algorithm that uses\nbounds of the cost function to define the pruning rules.

    "abstract": "Motivation: Machine learning methods can be used to support scientific\ndiscovery in healthcare-related research fields. However, these methods can\nonly be reliably used if they can be trained on high-quality and curated\ndatasets. Currently, no such dataset for the exploration of Plasmodium\nfalciparum protein antigen candidates exists. The parasite Plasmodium\nfalciparum causes the infectious disease malaria. Thus, identifying potential\nantigens is of utmost importance for the development of antimalarial drugs and\nvaccines. Since exploring antigen candidates experimentally is an expensive and\ntime-consuming process, applying machine learning methods to support this\nprocess has the potential to accelerate the development of drugs and vaccines\nwhich are needed for fighting and controlling malaria.\nResults: We developed PlasmoFAB, a curated benchmark that can be used to\ntrain machine learning methods for the exploration of Plasmodium falciparum\nprotein antigen candidates. We combined an extensive literature search with\ndomain expertise to create high-quality labels for Plasmodium falciparum\nspecific proteins that distinguish between antigen candidates and intracellular\nproteins. Additionally, we used our benchmark to compare different well-known\nprediction models and available protein localization prediction services on the\ntask of identifying protein antigen candidates. We show that available\ngeneral-purpose services are unable to provide sufficient performance on\nidentifying protein antigen candidates and are outperformed by models that were\ntrained on specialized data.",

In many real world applications, one often encounters high\ndimensional data (e.g. point cloud data) centred around some lower dimensional\nunknown manifolds. The geometry of manifold is in general different from the\nusual Euclidean geometry. Naively applying traditional smoothing methods such\nas Euclidean Gaussian Processes (GPs) to manifold valued data and so ignoring\nthe geometry of the space can potentially lead to highly misleading predictions\nand inferences. A manifold embedded in a high dimensional Euclidean space can\nbe well described by a probabilistic mapping function and the corresponding\nlatent space. We investigate the geometrical structure of the unknown manifolds\nusing the Bayesian Gaussian Processes latent variable models(BGPLVM) and\nRiemannian geometry. The distribution of the metric tensor is learned using\nBGPLVM. The boundary of the resulting manifold is defined based on the\nuncertainty quantification of the mapping. We use the the probabilistic metric\ntensor to simulate Brownian Motion paths on the unknown manifold. The heat\nkernel is estimated as the transition density of Brownian Motion and used as\nthe covariance functions of GPUM. The applications of GPUM are illustrated in\nthe simulation studies on the Swiss roll, high dimensional real datasets of\nWiFi signals and image data examples.

The diversity of communication\nprotocols and hardware creates a problematic case, since this diversity\nrequires to design or update the calibration procedures for each new advanced\nantenna system.

Firstly, we\ndefine a parameter space, based on near-field measurements, that captures the\nunderlying hardware impairments corresponding to each radiating element, their\npositional offsets, as well as the mutual coupling effects between antenna\nelements. Secondly, Gaussian process regression is used to form models from a\nsparse set of the aforementioned near-field data.

    "abstract": "Accurate image reconstruction is crucial for photoacoustic (PA) computed\ntomography (PACT). Recently, deep learning has been used to reconstruct the PA\nimage with a supervised scheme, which requires high-quality images as ground\ntruth labels. In practice, there are inevitable trade-offs between cost and\nperformance since the use of more channels is an expensive strategy to access\nmore measurements. Here, we propose a cross-domain unsupervised reconstruction\n(CDUR) strategy with a pure transformer model, which overcomes the lack of\nground truth labels from limited PA measurements. The proposed approach\nexploits the equivariance of PACT to achieve high performance with a smaller\nnumber of channels. We implement a self-supervised reconstruction in a\nmodel-based form. Meanwhile, we also leverage the self-supervision to enforce\nthe measurement and image consistency on three partitions of measured PA data,\nby randomly masking different channels. We find that dynamically masking a high\nproportion of the channels, e.g., 80%, yields nontrivial self-supervisors in\nboth image and signal domains, which decrease the multiplicity of the pseudo\nsolution to efficiently reconstruct the image from fewer PA measurements with\nminimum error of the image.

We solve the underlying combinatorial\nnonconvex optimization problem using alternating optimization and propose a\nlow-complexity solver, which is provably nearly optimal.

In contrast to the existing\ntheory that requires running subsolvers until a certain precision is reached,\nwe only assume that a finite number of gradient steps is taken at each\niteration. As a special case, our theory allows us to show the convergence of\nFirst-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FO-MAML) to the vicinity of a\nsolution of Moreau objective. We also study a more general family of\nfirst-order algorithms that can be viewed as a generalization of FO-MAML.

In particular, our perturbed-iterate analysis allows for tighter\nguarantees that improve the dependency on the problem's conditioning. In\ncontrast to the related work on meta-learning, ours does not require any\nassumptions on the Hessian smoothness, and can leverage smoothness and\nconvexity of the reformulation based on Moreau envelopes. Furthermore, to fill\nthe gaps in the comparison of FO-MAML to the Implicit MAML (iMAML), we show\nthat the objective of iMAML is neither smooth nor convex, implying that it has\nno convergence guarantees based on the existing theory.",

However, this result was derived from an informal\nargument, applied only to deterministic computations, and had an arbitrary\ndependence on the choice of physical protocol (via the additive constant). Here\nwe use stochastic thermodynamics to derive a generalized version of Zurek's\nbound from a rigorous Hamiltonian formulation. Our bound applies to all quantum\nand classical processes, whether noisy or deterministic, and it explicitly\ncaptures the dependence on the protocol. We show that $K(x\\vert y)$ is a\nfundamental cost of mapping $x$ to $y$ which must be paid using some\ncombination of heat, noise, and protocol complexity, implying a tradeoff\nbetween these three resources.

An early effective screening and\ngrading become imperative towards optimizing the limited available resources of\nthe medical facilities. Computed tomography (CT) provides a significant\nnon-invasive screening mechanism for COVID-19 infection. An automated\nsegmentation of the infected volumes in lung CT is expected to significantly\naid in the diagnosis and care of patients. However, an accurate demarcation of\nlesions remains problematic due to their irregular structure and location(s)\nwithin the lung. A novel deep learning architecture, Mixed Attention Deeply\nSupervised Network (MiADS-Net), is proposed for delineating the infected\nregions of the lung from CT images. Incorporating dilated convolutions with\nvarying dilation rates, into a mixed attention framework, allows capture of\nmulti-scale features towards improved segmentation of lesions having different\nsizes and textures. Mixed attention helps prioritise relevant feature maps to\nbe probed, along with those regions containing crucial information within these\nmaps. Deep supervision facilitates discovery of robust and discriminatory\ncharacteristics in the hidden layers at shallower levels, while overcoming the\nvanishing gradient. This is followed by estimating the severity of the disease,\nbased on the ratio of the area of infected region in each lung with respect to\nits entire volume. Experimental results, on three publicly available datasets,\nindicate that the MiADS-Net outperforms several state-of-the-art architectures\nin the COVID-19 lesion segmentation task; particularly in defining structures\ninvolving complex geometries.",

    "abstract": "We study mechanism design for public-good provision under a noisy\nprivacy-preserving transformation of individual agents' reported preferences.\nThe setting is a standard binary model with transfers and quasi-linear utility.\nAgents report their preferences for the public good, which are randomly\n``flipped,'' so that any individual report may be explained away as the outcome\nof noise. We study mechanisms that seek to preserve the public decisions made\nin the presence of noise (noise sensitivity), pursue efficiency, and mitigate\nthe effect of noise on revenue. The paper analyzes the trade-offs between these\ncompeting considerations.",

    "title": "General Index Reduction by Embedding for Integro-differential-algebraic  Equations",
    "abstract": "Integro differential algebraic equations are widely are widely used in\napplication. The existing definition of the signature matrix is insufficient,\nwhich will lead to the failure of structural methods. And existing structural\nmethods may fail for a system of integro differential algebraic equations if\nits Jacobian matrix after differentiation is still singular due to symbolic\ncancellation or numerical degeneration. That leads to the need to use the index\nreduction by embedding method to find all hidden constraints.\nIn this paper, for polynomially nonlinear systems of integro differential\nalgebraic equations, globally numerical method is given to solve both\ndegenerated cases using numerical real algebraic geometry. Firstly, we redefine\nthe signature matrix, so that it can solve the problems caused by numerical\ndegeneration and derivatives in differential terms. Secondly, we present a\ndefinition of degree of freedom for integro differential algebraic equations.\nThis can help to ensure termination of the index reduction by embedding method.\nThirdly, combined with witness point method, we give a framework of global\nnumerical method. Application example of model two stage drive system is used\nto demonstrate our method and its advantages.",

    "title": "Model Reproducibility Study on Left Atrial Fibres",
    "abstract": "We present an open-source software pipeline to create patient-specific left\natrial (LA) models with fibre orientations and a fibrosis map, suitable for\nelectrophysiology simulations. The semi-automatic pipeline takes as input a\ncontrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiogram, and a late gadolinium enhanced\n(LGE) contrast magnetic resonance (CMR). Five operators were allocated 20 cases\neach from a set of 50 CMR datasets to create a total of 100 models to evaluate\ninter/intra-operator variability. Each output model consisted of (1) a labelled\nsurface mesh open at the pulmonary veins (PV) and mitral valve (MV), (2) fibre\norientations mapped from a diffusion tensor MRI human atlas, (3) fibrosis map\nfrom the LGE-CMR scan, and (4) simulation of local activation time (LAT) and\nphase singularity (PS) mapping. We evaluated reproducibility in our pipeline by\ncomparing agreement in shape of the output meshes, fibrosis distribution in the\nLA body, and fibre orientations; simulations outputs were evaluated comparing\ntotal activation times of LAT maps, mean conduction velocity (CV), and\nstructural similarity index measure (SSIM) of PS maps. Our workflow allows a\nsingle model to be created in 16.72 +/- 12.25 minutes. Results in this abstract\nare reported as inter/intra. Shape only differed noticeably with users'\nselection of the MV and the length of the PV from the ostia to the distal end;\nfibrosis agreement (0.91/0.99 ICC) and fibre orientation agreement (60.63/71.77\n%) were high. LAT maps showed good agreement, the median of the absolute\ndifference of the total activation times was 2.02ms/1.37ms. The average of the\nmean CV difference was -4.04mm/s / 2.1mm/s. PS maps showed a moderately good\nagreement with SSIM of 0.648/0.608. Although we found notable differences in\nthe models due to user input, our tests show that operator variability was\ncomparable to that of image resolution or fibre estimation.",

    "title": "Consciousness is learning: predictive processing systems that learn by  binding may perceive themselves as conscious",
    "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms have achieved superhuman performance in specific\ncomplex domains. Yet learning online from few examples and efficiently\ngeneralizing across domains remains elusive. In humans such learning proceeds\nvia declarative memory formation and is closely associated with consciousness.\nPredictive processing has been advanced as a principled Bayesian inference\nframework for understanding the cortex as implementing deep generative\nperceptual models for both sensory data and action control. However, predictive\nprocessing offers little direct insight into fast compositional learning or the\nmystery of consciousness. Here we propose that through implementing online\nlearning by hierarchical binding of unpredicted inferences, a predictive\nprocessing system may flexibly generalize in novel situations by forming\nworking memories for perceptions and actions from single examples, which can\nbecome short- and long-term declarative memories retrievable by associative\nrecall. We argue that the contents of such working memories are unified yet\ndifferentiated, can be maintained by selective attention and are consistent\nwith observations of masking, postdictive perceptual integration, and other\nparadigm cases of consciousness research. We describe how the brain could have\nevolved to use perceptual value prediction for reinforcement learning of\ncomplex action policies simultaneously implementing multiple survival and\nreproduction strategies. 'Conscious experience' is how such a learning system\nperceptually represents its own functioning, suggesting an answer to the meta\nproblem of consciousness. Our proposal naturally unifies feature binding,\nrecurrent processing, and predictive processing with global workspace, and, to\na lesser extent, the higher order theories of consciousness.",

    "abstract": "Non-invasive brain imaging techniques allow understanding the behavior and\nmacro changes in the brain to determine the progress of a disease. However,\ncomputational pathology provides a deeper understanding of brain disorders at\ncellular level, able to consolidate a diagnosis and make the bridge between the\nmedical image and the omics analysis. In traditional histopathology, histology\nslides are visually inspected, under the microscope, by trained pathologists.\nThis process is time-consuming and labor-intensive; therefore, the emergence of\nComputational Pathology has triggered great hope to ease this tedious task and\nmake it more robust. This chapter focuses on understanding the state-of-the-art\nmachine learning techniques used to analyze whole slide images within the\ncontext of brain disorders. We present a selective set of remarkable machine\nlearning algorithms providing discriminative approaches and quality results on\nbrain disorders. These methodologies are applied to different tasks, such as\nmonitoring mechanisms contributing to disease progression and patient survival\nrates, analyzing morphological phenotypes for classification and quantitative\nassessment of disease, improving clinical care, diagnosing tumor specimens, and\nintraoperative interpretation. Thanks to the recent progress in machine\nlearning algorithms for high-content image processing, computational pathology\nmarks the rise of a new generation of medical discoveries and clinical\nprotocols, including in brain disorders.",

The porosity is\nconstituted as a periodic lattice generated by a representative cell consisting\nof elastic skeleton, rigid inclusion and a void pore. Unilateral frictionless\ncontact is considered between opposing surfaces of the pore. For the\nhomogenized model derived in our previous work, we justify incremental\nformulations and propose several variants of two-scale algorithms which commute\niteratively solving of the micro- and the macro-level contact subproblems. A\ndual formulation which take advantage of the assumed microstructure periodicity\nand a small deformation framework, is derived for the contact problems at the\nmicro-level. This enables to apply the semi-smooth Newton method. For the\nglobal, macrolevel step two alternatives are tested; one relying on a frozen\ncontact identified at the microlevel, the other based on a reduced contact\nassociated with boundaries of contact sets. Numerical examples of 2D deforming\nstructures are presented as a proof of the concept.",
