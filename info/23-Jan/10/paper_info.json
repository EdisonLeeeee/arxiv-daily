We present LAMA, Locomotion-Action-MAnipulation, to\nsynthesize natural and plausible long term human movements in complex indoor\nenvironments. The key motivation of LAMA is to build a unified framework to\nencompass a series of motions commonly observable in our daily lives, including\nlocomotion, interactions with 3D scenes, and manipulations of 3D objects. LAMA\nis based on a reinforcement learning framework coupled with a motion matching\nalgorithm to synthesize locomotion and scene interaction seamlessly under\ncommon constraints and collision avoidance handling. LAMA also exploits a\nmotion editing framework via manifold learning to cover possible variations in\ninteraction and manipulation motions. We quantitatively and qualitatively\ndemonstrate that LAMA outperforms existing approaches in various challenging\nscenarios. Project webpage: https://lama-www.github.io/ .",

    "abstract": "Particle filters are a group of algorithms to solve inverse problems through\nstatistical Bayesian methods when the model does not comply with the linear and\nGaussian hypothesis. Particle filters are used in domains like data\nassimilation, probabilistic programming, neural networkoptimization,\nlocalization and navigation. Particle filters estimate the\nprobabilitydistribution of model states by running a large number of model\ninstances, the so called particles. The ability to handle a very large number\nof particles is critical for high dimensional models.This paper proposes a\nnovel paradigm to run very large ensembles of parallel model instances on\nsupercomputers. The approach combines an elastic and fault tolerant\nrunner/server model minimizing data movementswhile enabling dynamic load\nbalancing. Particle weights are computed locally on each runner andtransmitted\nwhen available to a server that normalizes them, resamples new particles based\non their weight, and redistributes dynamically the work torunners to react to\nload imbalance. Our approach relies on a an asynchronously manageddistributed\nparticle cache permitting particles to move from one runner to another inthe\nbackground while particle propagation goes on. This also enables the number\nofrunners to vary during the execution either in reaction to failures and\nrestarts, orto adapt to changing resource availability dictated by external\ndecision processes.The approach is experimented with the Weather Research and\nForecasting (WRF) model, toassess its performance for probabilistic weather\nforecasting. Up to 2555particles on 20442 compute cores are used to assimilate\ncloud cover observations into short--range weather forecasts over Europe.",

Nevertheless, on\nreal-world graphs, it is usually difficult to obtain abundant labeled nodes for\nmany classes. In practice, each meta-training class can only consist of several\nlabeled nodes, known as the extremely weak supervision problem. In few-shot\nnode classification, with extremely limited labeled nodes for meta-training,\nthe generalization gap between meta-training and meta-test will become larger\nand thus lead to suboptimal performance. To tackle this issue, we study a novel\nproblem of few-shot node classification with extremely weak supervision and\npropose a principled framework X-FNC under the prevalent meta-learning\nframework. Specifically, our goal is to accumulate meta-knowledge across\ndifferent meta-training tasks with extremely weak supervision and generalize\nsuch knowledge to meta-test tasks. To address the challenges resulting from\nextremely scarce labeled nodes, we propose two essential modules to obtain\npseudo-labeled nodes as extra references and effectively learn from extremely\nlimited supervision information.

The results demonstrate that both LSTM\nand A-LSTM with cyclic feature encoding outperform those with one-hot feature\nencoding.",

    "title": "Multimodal Lyrics-Rhythm Matching",
    "abstract": "Despite the recent increase in research on artificial intelligence for music,\nprominent correlations between key components of lyrics and rhythm such as\nkeywords, stressed syllables, and strong beats are not frequently studied. Ths\nis likely due to challenges such as audio misalignment, inaccuracies in\nsyllabic identification, and most importantly, the need for cross-disciplinary\nknowledge. To address this lack of research, we propose a novel multimodal\nlyrics-rhythm matching approach in this paper that specifically matches key\ncomponents of lyrics and music with each other without any language\nlimitations. We use audio instead of sheet music with readily available\nmetadata, which creates more challenges yet increases the application\nflexibility of our method. Furthermore, our approach creatively generates\nseveral patterns involving various multimodalities, including music strong\nbeats, lyrical syllables, auditory changes in a singer's pronunciation, and\nespecially lyrical keywords, which are utilized for matching key lyrical\nelements with key rhythmic elements. This advantageous approach not only\nprovides a unique way to study auditory lyrics-rhythm correlations including\nefficient rhythm-based audio alignment algorithms, but also bridges\ncomputational linguistics with music as well as music cognition. Our\nexperimental results reveal an 0.81 probability of matching on average, and\naround 30% of the songs have a probability of 0.9 or higher of keywords landing\non strong beats, including 12% of the songs with a perfect landing. Also, the\nsimilarity metrics are used to evaluate the correlation between lyrics and\nrhythm. It shows that nearly 50% of the songs have 0.70 similarity or higher.\nIn conclusion, our approach contributes significantly to the lyrics-rhythm\nrelationship by computationally unveiling insightful correlations.",

    "abstract": "Social media networks commonly employ content moderation as a tool to limit\nthe spread of harmful content. However, the efficacy of this strategy in\nlimiting the delivery of harmful content to users is not well understood. In\nthis paper, we create a framework to quantify the efficacy of content\nmoderation and use our metrics to analyze content removal on Facebook within\nthe U.S. news ecosystem. In a data set of over 2M posts with 1.6B user\nengagements collected from 2,551 U.S. news sources before and during the\nCapitol Riot on January 6, 2021, we identify 10,811 removed posts. We find that\nthe active engagement life cycle of Facebook posts is very short, with 90% of\nall engagement occurring within the first 30 hours after posting. Thus, even\nrelatively quick intervention allowed significant accrual of engagement before\nremoval, and prevented only 21% of the predicted engagement potential during a\nbaseline period before the U.S. Capitol attack. Nearly a week after the attack,\nFacebook began removing older content, but these removals occurred so late in\nthese posts' engagement life cycles that they disrupted less than 1% of\npredicted future engagement, highlighting the limited impact of this\nintervention. Content moderation likely has limits in its ability to prevent\nengagement, especially in a crisis, and we recommend that other approaches such\nas slowing down the rate of content diffusion be investigated.",

In this work, we present a machine\nlearning-based multiscale method by integrating injection molding-induced\nmicrostructures, material homogenization, and Deep Material Network (DMN) in\nthe finite element simulation software LS-DYNA for structural analysis of SFRC.\nDMN is a physics-embedded machine learning model that learns the microscale\nmaterial morphologies hidden in representative volume elements of composites\nthrough offline training. By coupling DMN with finite elements, we have\ndeveloped a highly accurate and efficient data-driven approach, which predicts\nnonlinear behaviors of composite materials and structures at a computational\nspeed orders-of-magnitude faster than the high-fidelity direct numerical\nsimulation. To model industrial-scale SFRC products, transfer learning is\nutilized to generate a unified DMN database, which effectively captures the\neffects of injection molding-induced fiber orientations and volume fractions on\nthe overall composite properties.

    "abstract": "Finding antenna designs that satisfy frequency requirements and are also\noptimal with respect to multiple physical criteria is a critical component in\ndesigning next generation hardware. However, such a process is non-trivial\nbecause the objective function is typically highly nonlinear and sensitive to\nsubtle design change. Moreover, the objective to be optimized often involves\nelectromagnetic (EM) simulations, which is slow and expensive with commercial\nsimulation software. In this work, we propose a sample-efficient and accurate\nsurrogate model, named CZP (Constant Zeros Poles), to directly estimate the\nscattering coefficients in the frequency domain of a given 2D planar antenna\ndesign, without using a simulator. CZP achieves this by predicting the complex\nzeros and poles for the frequency response of scattering coefficients, which we\nhave theoretically justified for any linear PDE, including Maxwell's equations.\nMoreover, instead of using low-dimensional representations, CZP leverages a\nnovel image-based representation for antenna topology inspired by the existing\nmesh-based EM simulation techniques, and attention-based neural network\narchitectures. We demonstrate experimentally that CZP not only outperforms\nbaselines in terms of test loss, but also is able to find 2D antenna designs\nverifiable by commercial software with only 40k training samples, when coupling\nwith advanced sequential search techniques like reinforcement learning.",

Path planning and\ntracking control, in particular, are critical components of autonomous driving.\nHowever, It is challenging to comprehensively design an robust control\nalgorithm by integrating vehicle path planning in a complicated unstructured\nscenario for FDWEV. To address the above issue, this paper first proposes the\nartificial potential field (APF) method for path planning in the prescribed\npark with different static obstacles to generate the reference path\ninformation, where speed planning is incorporated considering kinematics and\ndynamic constraints. Second, two tracking control methods, curvature\ncalculation (CC-based) and model predictive control (MPC-based) methods with\nthe lateral dynamics model, are proposed to track the desired path under\ndifferent driving conditions, in which a forward-looking behavior model of the\ndriver with variable preview distance is designed based on fuzzy control\ntheory. CarSim-AMESim-Simulink co-simulation is conducted with the existence of\nobstacles. The simulation results show that the proposed two control approaches\nare effective for many driving scenarios and the MPC-based path-tracking\ncontroller enhances dynamic tracking performance and ensures good\nmaneuverability under high-dynamic driving conditions.",

O-RAN Alliance has been\ntransforming the RAN industry by proposing open RAN specifications and the\nprogrammable Non-Real-Time and Near-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controllers\n(Non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC). Both RICs provide platforms for running\napplications called rApps and xApps, respectively, to optimize the behavior of\nthe RAN.

Edge computing nodes often present limited resources and are\nexpensive compared to cloud computing. For example, in the O-RAN Signalling\nStorm Protection, Near-RT RIC is expected to support end-to-end control loop\nlatencies as low as 10ms. Therefore, performance-critical components of Near-RT\nRIC and certain xApps should run at the edge while other components can run on\nthe cloud.

    "abstract": "Recently, relying on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), many methods for\nsalient object detection in optical remote sensing images (ORSI-SOD) are\nproposed. However, most methods ignore the huge parameters and computational\ncost brought by CNNs, and only a few pay attention to the portability and\nmobility. To facilitate practical applications, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel lightweight network for ORSI-SOD based on semantic matching and edge\nalignment, termed SeaNet. Specifically, SeaNet includes a lightweight\nMobileNet-V2 for feature extraction, a dynamic semantic matching module (DSMM)\nfor high-level features, an edge self-alignment module (ESAM) for low-level\nfeatures, and a portable decoder for inference. First, the high-level features\nare compressed into semantic kernels. Then, semantic kernels are used to\nactivate salient object locations in two groups of high-level features through\ndynamic convolution operations in DSMM. Meanwhile, in ESAM, cross-scale edge\ninformation extracted from two groups of low-level features is self-aligned\nthrough L2 loss and used for detail enhancement. Finally, starting from the\nhighest-level features, the decoder infers salient objects based on the\naccurate locations and fine details contained in the outputs of the two\nmodules. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our\nlightweight SeaNet not only outperforms most state-of-the-art lightweight\nmethods but also yields comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art conventional\nmethods, while having only 2.76M parameters and running with 1.7G FLOPs for\n288x288 inputs.

In this paper, based on the observation that graphs\ntypically share some joint motif patterns, we propose a novel non-parametric\nsubgraph matching framework, dubbed MatchExplainer, to explore explanatory\nsubgraphs. It couples the target graph with other counterpart instances and\nidentifies the most crucial joint substructure by minimizing the node\ncorresponding-based distance.

    "title": "Knowledge Reasoning via Jointly Modeling Knowledge Graphs and Soft Rules",
    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a crucial role in many applications, such as\nquestion answering, but incompleteness is an urgent issue for their broad\napplication. Much research in knowledge graph completion (KGC) has been\nperformed to resolve this issue. The methods of KGC can be classified into two\nmajor categories: rule-based reasoning and embedding-based reasoning. The\nformer has high accuracy and good interpretability, but a major challenge is to\nobtain effective rules on large-scale KGs. The latter has good efficiency and\nscalability, but it relies heavily on data richness and cannot fully use domain\nknowledge in the form of logical rules. We propose a novel method that injects\nrules and learns representations iteratively to take full advantage of rules\nand embeddings. Specifically, we model the conclusions of rule groundings as\n0-1 variables and use a rule confidence regularizer to remove the uncertainty\nof the conclusions. The proposed approach has the following advantages: 1) It\ncombines the benefits of both rules and knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) and\nachieves a good balance between efficiency and scalability. 2) It uses an\niterative method to continuously improve KGEs and remove incorrect rule\nconclusions. Evaluations on two public datasets show that our method\noutperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, improving performance by\n2.7\\% and 4.3\\% in mean reciprocal rank (MRR).",

    "abstract": "In practice, we can not only disable some events, but also enforce the\noccurrence of some events prior to the occurrence of other events by external\ncontrol. In this paper, we combine these two control mechanisms to synthesize a\nmore powerful supervisor. Here our control goal is to design an isolation\nsupervisor which ensures in the closed-loop system, faults are isolatable in\nthe sense that after a fault occurs, we can determine which type the fault\nbelongs to by observing the output of the closed-loop system. The isolation\nsupervisor starts to work when the occurrence of faults is detected. We then\nsolve the isolation supervisor synthesis problem as follows. For a given\ndiscrete event system, we firstly construct a bipartite transition system which\nincludes all feasible isolation supervisors. An isolation supervisor is\nfeasible if it enforces only events that are physically possible. We then\ndevelop an algorithm to check whether the synthesis problem is solvable or not.\nThe algorithm can also be used to find a valid isolation supervisor if the\nsynthesis problem is solvable. The method of combining two control mechanisms\ncan be used to synthesize more powerful supervisors for other supervisory\ncontrol problems of discrete event systems as well.",

This paper presents Duet,\na scalable, manycore-FPGA architecture that promotes embedded FPGAs (eFPGA) to\nbe equal peers with processors through non-intrusive, bi-directionally\ncache-coherent integration. In contrast to existing CPU-FPGA hybrid systems in\nwhich the processors play a supportive role, Duet unleashes the full potential\nof both the processors and the eFPGAs with two classes of post-fabrication\nenhancements: fine-grained acceleration, which partitions an application into\nsmall tasks and offloads the frequently-invoked, compute-intensive ones onto\nvarious small accelerators, leveraging the processors to handle dynamic control\nflow and less accelerable tasks; hardware augmentation, which employs\neFPGA-emulated hardware widgets to improve processor efficiency or mitigate\nsoftware overheads in certain execution models. An RTL-level implementation of\nDuet is developed to evaluate the architecture with high fidelity. Experiments\nusing synthetic benchmarks show that Duet can reduce the processor-accelerator\ncommunication latency by up to 82% and increase the bandwidth by up to 9.5x.\nThe RTL implementation is further evaluated with seven application benchmarks,\nachieving 1.5-24.9x speedup.",

Instance-level GNN explanation\naims to discover critical input elements, like nodes or edges, that the target\nGNN relies upon for making predictions. %These identified sub-structures can\nprovide interpretations of GNN's behavior. Though various algorithms are\nproposed, most of them formalize this task by searching the minimal subgraph\nwhich can preserve original predictions.

Consequently, they have the danger of\nproviding spurious explanations and failing to provide consistent explanations.\nApplying them to explain weakly-performed GNNs would further amplify these\nissues. To address this problem, we theoretically examine the predictions of\nGNNs from the causality perspective.

The present paper proposes a method called RLAS-BIABC\nfor AS, which is established on attention mechanism-based long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) and the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers\n(BERT) word embedding, enriched by an improved artificial bee colony (ABC)\nalgorithm for pretraining and a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for\ntraining backpropagation (BP) algorithm. BERT can be comprised in downstream\nwork and fine-tuned as a united task-specific architecture, and the pretrained\nBERT model can grab different linguistic effects. Existing algorithms typically\ntrain the AS model with positive-negative pairs for a two-class classifier. A\npositive pair contains a question and a genuine answer, while a negative one\nincludes a question and a fake answer. The output should be one for positive\nand zero for negative pairs. Typically, negative pairs are more than positive,\nleading to an imbalanced classification that drastically reduces system\nperformance. To deal with it, we define classification as a sequential\ndecision-making process in which the agent takes a sample at each step and\nclassifies it. For each classification operation, the agent receives a reward,\nin which the prize of the majority class is less than the reward of the\nminority class. Ultimately, the agent finds the optimal value for the policy\nweights. We initialize the policy weights with the improved ABC algorithm. The\ninitial value technique can prevent problems such as getting stuck in the local\noptimum.

    "abstract": "Language models (LMs) compute the probability of a text by sequentially\ncomputing a representation of an already-seen context and using this\nrepresentation to predict the next word. Currently, most LMs calculate these\nrepresentations through a neural network consuming the immediate previous\ncontext. However recently, retrieval-augmented LMs have shown to improve over\nstandard neural LMs, by accessing information retrieved from a large datastore,\nin addition to their standard, parametric, next-word prediction. In this paper,\nwe set out to understand why retrieval-augmented language models, and\nspecifically why k-nearest neighbor language models (kNN-LMs) perform better\nthan standard parametric LMs, even when the k-nearest neighbor component\nretrieves examples from the same training set that the LM was originally\ntrained on. To this end, we perform a careful analysis of the various\ndimensions over which kNN-LM diverges from standard LMs, and investigate these\ndimensions one by one. Empirically, we identify three main reasons why kNN-LM\nperforms better than standard LMs: using a different input representation for\npredicting the next tokens, approximate kNN search, and the importance of\nsoftmax temperature for the kNN distribution. Further, we incorporate these\ninsights into the model architecture or the training procedure of the standard\nparametric LM, improving its results without the need for an explicit retrieval\ncomponent.

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) algorithms have shown significant performance in various\ncomputer vision tasks. However, having limited labelled data lead to a network\noverfitting problem, where network performance is bad on unseen data as\ncompared to training data. Consequently, it limits performance improvement. To\ncope with this problem, various techniques have been proposed such as dropout,\nnormalization and advanced data augmentation. Among these, data augmentation,\nwhich aims to enlarge the dataset size by including sample diversity, has been\na hot topic in recent times. In this article, we focus on advanced data\naugmentation techniques. we provide a background of data augmentation, a novel\nand comprehensive taxonomy of reviewed data augmentation techniques, and the\nstrengths and weaknesses (wherever possible) of each technique. We also provide\ncomprehensive results of the data augmentation effect on three popular computer\nvision tasks, such as image classification, object detection and semantic\nsegmentation. For results reproducibility, we compiled available codes of all\ndata augmentation techniques. Finally, we discuss the challenges and\ndifficulties, and possible future direction for the research community. We\nbelieve, this survey provides several benefits i) readers will understand the\ndata augmentation working mechanism to fix overfitting problems ii) results\nwill save the searching time of the researcher for comparison purposes. iii)\nCodes of the mentioned data augmentation techniques are available at\nhttps://github.com/kmr2017/Advanced-Data-augmentation-codes iv) Future work\nwill spark interest in research community.",

    "abstract": "To make a good balance between performance, cost, and power consumption, a\nhybrid intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided directional modulation (DM)\nnetwork is investigated in this paper, where the hybrid IRS consists of passive\nand active reflecting elements. To maximize the achievable rate, two\noptimization algorithms, called maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-fractional\nprogramming (FP) (Max-SNR-FP) and maximum SNR-equal amplitude reflecting (EAR)\n(Max-SNR-EAR), are proposed to jointly design the beamforming vector and IRS\nphase shift matrix by alternately optimizing one and fixing another. The former\nemploys the successive convex approximation and FP methods to solve the\nbeamforming vector and hybrid IRS phase shift matrix, while the latter uses the\nmaximum signal-to-leakage-noise ratio method and the criteria of phase\nalignment and EAR to design them. Simulation results show that the rates\nharvested by the proposed two methods are slightly lower than that of active\nIRS with higher power consumption, which are 35 percent higher than those of no\nIRS and random phase IRS, while passive IRS achieves only about 17 percent rate\ngain over the latter. Moreover, compared to Max-SNR-FP, the proposed\nMax-SNR-EAR method makes an obvious complexity reduction at the cost of a\nslight rate performance loss.",

    "abstract": "$\\bf{Purpose}$: To describe the 3D structural changes in both connective and\nneural tissues of the optic nerve head (ONH) that occur concurrently at\ndifferent stages of glaucoma using traditional and AI-driven approaches.\n$\\bf{Methods}$: We included 213 normal, 204 mild glaucoma (mean deviation\n[MD] $\\ge$ -6.00 dB), 118 moderate glaucoma (MD of -6.01 to -12.00 dB), and 118\nadvanced glaucoma patients (MD < -12.00 dB). All subjects had their ONHs imaged\nin 3D with Spectralis optical coherence tomography. To describe the 3D\nstructural phenotype of glaucoma as a function of severity, we used two\ndifferent approaches: (1) We extracted human-defined 3D structural parameters\nof the ONH including retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, lamina\ncribrosa (LC) shape and depth at different stages of glaucoma; (2) we also\nemployed a geometric deep learning method (i.e. PointNet) to identify the most\nimportant 3D structural features that differentiate ONHs from different\nglaucoma severity groups without any human input.\n$\\bf{Results}$: We observed that the majority of ONH structural changes\noccurred in the early glaucoma stage, followed by a plateau effect in the later\nstages. Using PointNet, we also found that 3D ONH structural changes were\npresent in both neural and connective tissues. In both approaches, we observed\nthat structural changes were more prominent in the superior and inferior\nquadrant of the ONH, particularly in the RNFL, the prelamina, and the LC. As\nthe severity of glaucoma increased, these changes became more diffuse (i.e.\nwidespread), particularly in the LC.\n$\\bf{Conclusions}$: In this study, we were able to uncover complex 3D\nstructural changes of the ONH in both neural and connective tissues as a\nfunction of glaucoma severity. We hope to provide new insights into the complex\npathophysiology of glaucoma that might help clinicians in their daily clinical\ncare.",

    "abstract": "The emerging drone aerial survey has the advantages of low cost, high\nefficiency, and flexible use. However, UAVs are often equipped with cheap POS\nsystems and non-measurement cameras, and their flight attitudes are easily\naffected. How to realize the large-scale mapping of UAV image-free control\nsupported by POS faces many technical problems. The most basic and important\ncore technology is how to accurately realize the absolute orientation of images\nthrough advanced aerial triangulation technology. In traditional aerial\ntriangulation, image matching algorithms are constrained to varying degrees by\npreset prior knowledge. In recent years, deep learning has developed rapidly in\nthe field of photogrammetric computer vision. It has surpassed the performance\nof traditional handcrafted features in many aspects. It has shown stronger\nstability in image-based navigation and positioning tasks, especially it has\nbetter resistance to unfavorable factors such as blur, illumination changes,\nand geometric distortion. Based on the introduction of the key technologies of\naerial triangulation without image control points, this paper proposes a new\ndrone image registration method based on deep learning image features to solve\nthe problem of high mismatch rate in traditional methods. It adopts SuperPoint\nas the feature detector, uses the superior generalization performance of CNN to\nextract precise feature points from the UAV image, thereby achieving\nhigh-precision aerial triangulation. Experimental results show that under the\nsame pre-processing and post-processing conditions, compared with the\ntraditional method based on the SIFT algorithm, this method achieves suitable\nprecision more efficiently, which can meet the requirements of UAV aerial\ntriangulation without image control points in large-scale surveys.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study several important geometric optimization problems\narising in machine learning. First, we revisit the Minimum Enclosing Ball (MEB)\nproblem in Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^d$. The problem has been extensively\nstudied before, but real-world machine learning tasks often need to handle\nlarge-scale datasets so that we cannot even afford linear time algorithms.\nMotivated by the recent studies on {\\em beyond worst-case analysis}, we\nintroduce the notion of stability for MEB, which is natural and easy to\nunderstand. Roughly speaking, an instance of MEB is stable, if the radius of\nthe resulting ball cannot be significantly reduced by removing a small fraction\nof the input points. Under the stability assumption, we present two sampling\nalgorithms for computing radius-approximate MEB with sample complexities\nindependent of the number of input points $n$. In particular, the second\nalgorithm has the sample complexity even independent of the dimensionality $d$.\nWe also consider the general case without the stability assumption. We present\na hybrid algorithm that can output either a radius-approximate MEB or a\ncovering-approximate MEB. Our algorithm improves the running time and the\nnumber of passes for the previous sublinear MEB algorithms. Our method relies\non two novel techniques, the Uniform-Adaptive Sampling method and Sandwich\nLemma. Furthermore, we observe that these two techniques can be generalized to\ndesign sublinear time algorithms for a broader range of geometric optimization\nproblems with outliers in high dimensions, including MEB with outliers,\none-class and two-class linear SVMs with outliers, $k$-center clustering with\noutliers, and flat fitting with outliers.

Some tasks may benefit from being learned together while others may\nbe detrimental to one another. From a task perspective, grouping cooperative\ntasks while separating competing tasks is paramount to reap the benefits of\nMTL, i.e., reducing training and inference costs. Therefore, estimating task\naffinity for joint learning is a key endeavor. Recent work suggests that the\ntraining conditions themselves have a significant impact on the outcomes of\nMTL. Yet, the literature is lacking of a benchmark to assess the effectiveness\nof tasks affinity estimation techniques and their relation with actual MTL\nperformance.

By utilizing specific symbols\ncommonly found in ABC notation to indicate section boundaries, TunesFormer can\nunderstand and generate melodies with given musical forms based on control\ncodes. Our objective evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the control\ncodes in achieving controlled musical forms, and subjective experiments show\nthat the generated melodies are of comparable quality to human compositions.\nOur results also provide insights into the optimal placement of control codes\nand their impact on the generated melodies. TunesFormer presents a promising\napproach for generating melodies with desired musical forms through the use of\ndeep learning techniques.",

    "abstract": "Complex network analysis has brought significant advances in uncovering\nnetwork mesoscopic properties. Community detection is one of the significant\nfeatures of understanding real-world complex systems. In this paper, we propose\na High-order node proximity Spectral Clustering on Ratios-of-Eigenvectors\n(SCOREH+) algorithm for finding communities in complex networks. This algorithm\npreserves high-order transitivity information of the network affinity matrix.\nFirst, we construct the high-order proximity matrix from the original affinity\nmatrix using the Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) and Katz index. Furthermore, we\nobtain the normalized Laplacian matrix and the normalized leading eigenvectors.\nThe ratios of the leading eigenvectors aid in mitigating the effect of degree\nheterogeneity. Moreover, we implement a procedure that joins an additional\neigenvector (the $(K+1)^{th}$ leading eigenvector) to the spectrum domain for\nclustering if the network is considered to be a ``weak signal\" graph. Finally,\nwe apply the K-means algorithm to the spectrum domain for acquiring the node\nlabels. We compare our SCOREH+ algorithm with spectral clustering (SC),\nSpectral Clustering on Ratios-of-Eigenvectors (SCORE), and SCORE+. To\ndemonstrate the high effectiveness of our algorithm, we conducted comparison\nexperiments on $11$ real-world networks and several synthetic networks with\nnoise. The experimental results demonstrate that our SCOREH+ outperforms SC,\nSCORE, and SCORE+ on most of these networks. In addition, we find that by\ntuning the RBFs and their shaping parameters, we can obtain state-of-the-art\ncommunity structures on all real-world networks and even on noisy synthetic\nnetworks.",

    "abstract": "Sound matching algorithms seek to approximate a target waveform by parametric\naudio synthesis. Deep neural networks have achieved promising results in\nmatching sustained harmonic tones. However, the task is more challenging when\ntargets are nonstationary and inharmonic, e.g., percussion. We attribute this\nproblem to the inadequacy of loss function. On one hand, mean square error in\nthe parametric domain, known as \"P-loss\", is simple and fast but fails to\naccommodate the differing perceptual significance of each parameter. On the\nother hand, mean square error in the spectrotemporal domain, known as \"spectral\nloss\", is perceptually motivated and serves in differentiable digital signal\nprocessing (DDSP). Yet, spectral loss has more local minima than P-loss and its\ngradient may be computationally expensive; hence a slow convergence. Against\nthis conundrum, we present Perceptual-Neural-Physical loss (PNP). PNP is the\noptimal quadratic approximation of spectral loss while being as fast as P-loss\nduring training. We instantiate PNP with physical modeling synthesis as decoder\nand joint time-frequency scattering transform (JTFS) as spectral\nrepresentation.

    "abstract": "Evolutionary anti-coordination games on networks capture real-world strategic\nsituations such as traffic routing and market competition. In such games,\nagents maximize their utility by choosing actions that differ from their\nneighbors' actions. Two important problems concerning evolutionary games are\nthe existence of a pure Nash equilibrium (NE) and the convergence time of the\ndynamics. In this work, we study these two problems for anti-coordination games\nunder sequential and synchronous update schemes. For each update scheme, we\nexamine two decision modes based on whether an agent considers its own previous\naction (self essential ) or not (self non-essential ) in choosing its next\naction. Using a relationship between games and dynamical systems, we show that\nfor both update schemes, finding an NE can be done efficiently under the self\nnon-essential mode but is computationally intractable under the self essential\nmode. To cope with this hardness, we identify special cases for which an NE can\nbe obtained efficiently. For convergence time, we show that the best-response\ndynamics converges in a polynomial number of steps in the synchronous scheme\nfor both modes; for the sequential scheme, the convergence time is polynomial\nonly under the self non-essential mode.

    "abstract": "In today's data-driven world, the sensitivity of information has been a\nsignificant concern. With this data and additional information on the person's\nbackground, one can easily infer an individual's private data. Many\ndifferentially private iterative algorithms have been proposed in interactive\nsettings to protect an individual's privacy from these inference attacks. The\nexisting approaches adapt the method to compute differentially private(DP)\ncentroids by iterative Llyod's algorithm and perturbing the centroid with\nvarious DP mechanisms. These DP mechanisms do not guarantee convergence of\ndifferentially private iterative algorithms and degrade the quality of the\ncluster. Thus, in this work, we further extend the previous work on\n'Differentially Private k-Means Clustering With Convergence Guarantee' by\ntaking it as our baseline. The novelty of our approach is to sub-cluster the\nclusters and then select the centroid which has a higher probability of moving\nin the direction of the future centroid. At every Lloyd's step, the centroids\nare injected with the noise using the exponential DP mechanism. The results of\nthe experiments indicate that our approach outperforms the current\nstate-of-the-art method, i.e., the baseline algorithm, in terms of clustering\nquality while maintaining the same differential privacy requirements.

    "title": "How to Allocate your Label Budget? Choosing between Active Learning and  Learning to Reject in Anomaly Detection",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection attempts at finding examples that deviate from the expected\nbehaviour. Usually, anomaly detection is tackled from an unsupervised\nperspective because anomalous labels are rare and difficult to acquire.\nHowever, the lack of labels makes the anomaly detector have high uncertainty in\nsome regions, which usually results in poor predictive performance or low user\ntrust in the predictions. One can reduce such uncertainty by collecting\nspecific labels using Active Learning (AL), which targets examples close to the\ndetector's decision boundary. Alternatively, one can increase the user trust by\nallowing the detector to abstain from making highly uncertain predictions,\nwhich is called Learning to Reject (LR). One way to do this is by thresholding\nthe detector's uncertainty based on where its performance is low, which\nrequires labels to be evaluated. Although both AL and LR need labels, they work\nwith different types of labels: AL seeks strategic labels, which are evidently\nbiased, while LR requires i.i.d. labels to evaluate the detector's performance\nand set the rejection threshold. Because one usually has a unique label budget,\ndeciding how to optimally allocate it is challenging. In this paper, we propose\na mixed strategy that, given a budget of labels, decides in multiple rounds\nwhether to use the budget to collect AL labels or LR labels. The strategy is\nbased on a reward function that measures the expected gain when allocating the\nbudget to either side. We evaluate our strategy on 18 benchmark datasets and\ncompare it to some baselines.",

The enabler technology for these\ncomplex systems are powerful application core processors with operating system\nsupport, such as Linux. While the isolation of applications through the\noperating system increases the security, the interface to the kernel poses a\nnew threat. Different attack vectors, including fault attacks and memory\nvulnerabilities, exploit the kernel interface to escalate privileges and take\nover the system.\nIn this work, we present SFP, a mechanism to protect the execution of system\ncalls against software and fault attacks providing integrity to user-kernel\ntransitions. SFP provides system call flow integrity by a two-step linking\napproach, which links the system call and its origin to the state of\ncontrol-flow integrity. A second linking step within the kernel ensures that\nthe right system call is executed in the kernel. Combining both linking steps\nensures that only the correct system call is executed at the right location in\nthe program and cannot be skipped. Furthermore, SFP provides dynamic CFI\ninstrumentation and a new CFI checking policy at the edge of the kernel to\nverify the control-flow state of user programs before entering the kernel. We\nintegrated SFP into FIPAC, a CFI protection scheme exploiting ARM pointer\nauthentication.

In this paper, we\nfocus on biological sequence design to maximize some sequence score. A recent\napproach employs bidirectional learning, combining a forward mapping for\nexploitation and a backward mapping for constraint, and it relies on the neural\ntangent kernel (NTK) of an infinitely wide network to build a proxy model.\nThough effective, the NTK cannot learn features because of its parametrization,\nand its use prevents the incorporation of powerful pre-trained Language Models\n(LMs) that can capture the rich biophysical information in millions of\nbiological sequences. We adopt an alternative proxy model, adding a linear head\nto a pre-trained LM, and propose a linearization scheme. This yields a\nclosed-form loss and also takes into account the biophysical information in the\npre-trained LM.

    "abstract": "The segmentation and automatic identification of histological regions of\ndiagnostic interest offer a valuable aid to pathologists. However, segmentation\nmethods are hampered by the difficulty of obtaining pixel-level annotations,\nwhich are tedious and expensive to obtain for Whole-Slide images (WSI). To\nremedy this, weakly supervised methods have been developed to exploit the\nannotations directly available at the image level. However, to our knowledge,\nnone of these techniques is adapted to deal with WSIs. In this paper, we\npropose WholeSIGHT, a weakly-supervised method, to simultaneously segment and\nclassify WSIs of arbitrary shapes and sizes. Formally, WholeSIGHT first\nconstructs a tissue-graph representation of the WSI, where the nodes and edges\ndepict tissue regions and their interactions, respectively.

    "abstract": "Contactless 3D finger knuckle patterns have emerged as an effective biometric\nidentifier due to its discriminativeness, visibility from a distance, and\nconvenience. Recent research has developed a deep feature collaboration network\nwhich simultaneously incorporates intermediate features from deep neural\nnetworks with multiple scales. However, this approach results in a large\nfeature dimension, and the trained classification layer is required for\ncomparing probe samples, which limits the introduction of new classes. This\npaper advances this approach by investigating the possibility of learning a\ndiscriminative feature vector with the least possible dimension for\nrepresenting 3D finger knuckle images. Experimental results are presented using\na publicly available 3D finger knuckle images database with comparisons to\npopular deep learning architectures and the state-of-the-art 3D finger knuckle\nrecognition methods. The proposed approach offers outperforming results in\nclassification and identification tasks under the more practical feature\ncomparison scenario, i.e., using the extracted deep feature instead of the\ntrained classification layer for comparing probe samples. More importantly,\nthis approach can offer 99% reduction in the size of feature templates, which\nis highly attractive for deploying biometric systems in the real world.\nExperiments are also performed using other two public biometric databases with\nsimilar patterns to ascertain the effectiveness and generalizability of our\nproposed approach.",

Such a directivity problem is formulated to find the\noptimal minimum distance between the antenna elements $d_\\text{min}$ aiming to\nachieve as high directivity gains as possible. {An expedited implementation\nmethod is developed to place the antenna elements in a distinctive plane\ndependent on ($\\theta_0$; $\\phi_0$). A novel concept on optimizing directivity\nfor the uniform planar array (OUPA) is introduced to find a quasi-optimal\nsolution for the non-convex optimization problem with low complexity. This\nsolution is reached by deploying the proposed successive evaluation and\nvalidation (SEV) method. {Moreover, the genetic} algorithm (GA) method was\ndeployed to find the directivity optimization solution expeditiously.

Climate change is at the\nroot of many recent natural hazards while the COVID-19 pandemic is still an\nactive threat. Social vulnerability also refers to resilience, or the ability\nto recover from such adverse events. To gauge the many aspects of social\nvulnerability the US Center of Disease Control (CDC) has subdivided social\nvulnerabilities into distinct themes, such as socioeconomic status, household\ncomposition, and others. Knowing a community's social vulnerabilities can help\npolicymakers and responders to recognize risks to community health, prepare for\npossible hazards, or recover from disasters. In this paper we study social\nvulnerabilities on the US county level and present research that suggests that\nthere are certain combinations, or patterns, of social vulnerability indicators\ninto which US counties can be grouped.

    "abstract": "Many real-world reinforcement learning (RL) problems necessitate learning\ncomplex, temporally extended behavior that may only receive reward signal when\nthe behavior is completed. If the reward-worthy behavior is known, it can be\nspecified in terms of a non-Markovian reward function - a function that depends\non aspects of the state-action history, rather than just the current state and\naction. Such reward functions yield sparse rewards, necessitating an inordinate\nnumber of experiences to find a policy that captures the reward-worthy pattern\nof behavior. Recent work has leveraged Knowledge Representation (KR) to provide\na symbolic abstraction of aspects of the state that summarize reward-relevant\nproperties of the state-action history and support learning a Markovian\ndecomposition of the problem in terms of an automaton over the KR. Providing\nsuch a decomposition has been shown to vastly improve learning rates,\nespecially when coupled with algorithms that exploit automaton structure.\nNevertheless, such techniques rely on a priori knowledge of the KR. In this\nwork, we explore how to automatically discover useful state abstractions that\nsupport learning automata over the state-action history. The result is an\nend-to-end algorithm that can learn optimal policies with significantly fewer\nenvironment samples than state-of-the-art RL on simple non-Markovian domains.",

In this paper, we focus on the small-scale spatial correlation and\neigenvalue properties excluding and including MC effects, for RISs with a\nquasi-continuous aperture (i.e., holographic RISs). Specifically, asymptotic\nbehaviors of far-field and near-field eigenvalues of the spatial correlation\nmatrix of holographic RISs without MC are first investigated, where the\ncounter-intuitive observation of a lower DoF with more elements is explained by\nleveraging the power spectrum of the spatial correlation function. Second, a\nnovel metric is proposed to quantify the inter-element correlation or coupling\nstrength in RISs and ordinary antenna arrays. Furthermore, in-depth analysis is\nperformed regarding the MC effects on array gain, effective spatial\ncorrelation, and eigenvalue architectures for a variety of element intervals\nwhen a holographic RIS works in the radiation and reception mode, respectively.\nThe analysis and numerical results demonstrate that a considerable amount of\nthe eigenvalues of the spatial correlation matrix correspond to evanescent\nwaves that are promising for near-field communication and sensing.

However, data augmentation techniques are limited to the \"seen\" pose\ncombinations and hard to infer poses with rare \"unseen\" joint positions. To\naddress this problem, we present CameraPose, a weakly-supervised framework for\n3D human pose estimation from a single image, which can not only be applied on\n2D-3D pose pairs but also on 2D alone annotations. By adding a camera parameter\nbranch, any in-the-wild 2D annotations can be fed into our pipeline to boost\nthe training diversity and the 3D poses can be implicitly learned by\nreprojecting back to 2D.

Experimental results demonstrate\nthat the CameraPose brings in clear improvements on cross-scenario datasets.\nNotably, it outperforms the baseline method by 3mm on the most challenging\ndataset 3DPW.

In\nthis paper, we present the first convergence analysis to show that under the\nnon-i.i.d. data, the mismatch between the local and global statistical\nparameters in BN causes the gradient deviation between the local and global\nmodels, which, as a result, slows down and biases the FL convergence. In view\nof this, we develop a new FL algorithm that is tailored to BN, called FedTAN,\nwhich is capable of achieving robust FL performance under a variety of data\ndistributions via iterative layer-wise parameter aggregation. Comprehensive\nexperimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FedTAN over\nexisting baselines for training BN-based DNN models.",

    "abstract": "Logical reasoning task involves diverse types of complex reasoning over text,\nbased on the form of multiple-choice question answering. Given the context,\nquestion and a set of options as the input, previous methods achieve superior\nperformances on the full-data setting. However, the current benchmark dataset\nhas the ideal assumption that the reasoning type distribution on the train\nsplit is close to the test split, which is inconsistent with many real\napplication scenarios. To address it, there remain two problems to be studied:\n(1) How is the zero-shot capability of the models (train on seen types and test\non unseen types)? (2) How to enhance the perception of reasoning types for the\nmodels? For problem 1, we propose a new benchmark for generalized zero-shot\nlogical reasoning, named ZsLR. It includes six splits based on the three type\nsampling strategies. For problem 2, a type-aware model TaCo is proposed. It\nutilizes both the heuristic input reconstruction and the contrastive learning\nto improve the type perception in the global representation. Extensive\nexperiments on both the zero-shot and full-data settings prove the superiority\nof TaCo over the state-of-the-art methods. Also, we experiment and verify the\ngeneralization capability of TaCo on other logical reasoning dataset.",

    "abstract": "Local feature matching between images remains a challenging task, especially\nin the presence of significant appearance variations, e.g., extreme viewpoint\nchanges. In this work, we propose DeepMatcher, a deep Transformer-based network\nbuilt upon our investigation of local feature matching in detector-free\nmethods. The key insight is that local feature matcher with deep layers can\ncapture more human-intuitive and simpler-to-match features. Based on this, we\npropose a Slimming Transformer (SlimFormer) dedicated for DeepMatcher, which\nleverages vector-based attention to model relevance among all keypoints and\nachieves long-range context aggregation in an efficient and effective manner. A\nrelative position encoding is applied to each SlimFormer so as to explicitly\ndisclose relative distance information, further improving the representation of\nkeypoints. A layer-scale strategy is also employed in each SlimFormer to enable\nthe network to assimilate message exchange from the residual block adaptively,\nthus allowing it to simulate the human behaviour that humans can acquire\ndifferent matching cues each time they scan an image pair. To facilitate a\nbetter adaption of the SlimFormer, we introduce a Feature Transition Module\n(FTM) to ensure a smooth transition in feature scopes with different receptive\nfields. By interleaving the self- and cross-SlimFormer multiple times,\nDeepMatcher can easily establish pixel-wise dense matches at coarse level.\nFinally, we perceive the match refinement as a combination of classification\nand regression problems and design Fine Matches Module to predict confidence\nand offset concurrently, thereby generating robust and accurate matches.\nExperimentally, we show that DeepMatcher significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, demonstrating the superior\nmatching capability of DeepMatcher.",

    "abstract": "Sequential multi-step cloth manipulation is a challenging problem in robotic\nmanipulation, requiring a robot to perceive the cloth state and plan a sequence\nof chained actions leading to the desired state. Most previous works address\nthis problem in a goal-conditioned way, and goal observation must be given for\neach specific task and cloth configuration, which is not practical and\nefficient. Thus, we present a novel multi-step cloth manipulation planning\nframework named Foldformer. Foldformer can complete similar tasks with only a\ngeneral demonstration and utilize a space-time attention mechanism to capture\nthe instruction information behind this demonstration. We experimentally\nevaluate Foldsformer on four representative sequential multi-step manipulation\ntasks and show that Foldsformer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches in simulation. Foldformer can complete multi-step cloth manipulation\ntasks even when configurations of the cloth (e.g., size and pose) vary from\nconfigurations in the general demonstrations. Furthermore, our approach can be\ntransferred from simulation to the real world without additional training or\ndomain randomization. Despite training on rectangular clothes, we also show\nthat our approach can generalize to unseen cloth shapes (T-shirts and shorts).\nVideos and source code are available at:\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/foldsformer.",

However, it is common that real-world time series data\nare recorded in a short time period, which results in a big gap between the\ndeep model and the limited and noisy time series. In this work, we propose to\naddress the time series forecasting problem with generative modeling and\npropose a bidirectional variational auto-encoder (BVAE) equipped with\ndiffusion, denoise, and disentanglement, namely D3VAE. Specifically, a coupled\ndiffusion probabilistic model is proposed to augment the time series data\nwithout increasing the aleatoric uncertainty and implement a more tractable\ninference process with BVAE. To ensure the generated series move toward the\ntrue target, we further propose to adapt and integrate the multiscale denoising\nscore matching into the diffusion process for time series forecasting. In\naddition, to enhance the interpretability and stability of the prediction, we\ntreat the latent variable in a multivariate manner and disentangle them on top\nof minimizing total correlation. Extensive experiments on synthetic and\nreal-world data show that D3VAE outperforms competitive algorithms with\nremarkable margins.

This kind of discovery is getting more\npopular in real-life applications due to its impact on big data analytics. In\nthis study, from the social-media and healthcare domain, we apply popular\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) methods to model the topic changes in Swedish\nnewspaper articles about Coronavirus. We describe the corpus we created\nincluding 6515 articles, methods applied, and statistics on topic changes over\napproximately 1 year and two months period of time from 17th January 2020 to\n13th March 2021. We hope this work can be an asset for grounding applications\nof topic modelling and can be inspiring for similar case studies in an era with\npandemics, to support socio-economic impact research as well as clinical and\nhealthcare analytics.

    "abstract": "Network (or graph) sparsification compresses a graph by removing inessential\nedges. By reducing the data volume, it accelerates or even facilitates many\ndownstream analyses. Still, the accuracy of many sparsification methods, with\nfiltering-based edge sampling being the most typical one, heavily relies on an\nappropriate definition of edge importance. Instead, we propose a different\nperspective with a generalized local-property-based sampling method, which\npreserves (scaled) local \\emph{node} characteristics. Apart from degrees, these\nlocal node characteristics we use are the expected (scaled) number of wedges\nand triangles a node belongs to. Through such a preservation, main complex\nstructural properties are preserved implicitly. We adapt a game-theoretic\nframework from uncertain graph sampling by including a threshold for faster\nconvergence (at least $4$ times faster empirically) to approximate solutions.\nExtensive experimental studies on functional climate networks show the\neffectiveness of this method in preserving macroscopic to mesoscopic and\nmicroscopic network structural properties.",

Most\nstate-of-the-art crowd counting methods based on color images can't work well\nin poor illumination conditions due to invisible objects. With the widespread\nuse of infrared cameras, crowd counting based on color and thermal images is\nstudied. Existing methods only achieve multi-modal fusion without count\nobjective constraint. To better excavate multi-modal information, we use\ncount-guided multi-modal fusion and modal-guided count enhancement to achieve\nthe impressive performance. The proposed count-guided multi-modal fusion module\nutilizes a multi-scale token transformer to interact two-modal information\nunder the guidance of count information and perceive different scales from the\ntoken perspective. The proposed modal-guided count enhancement module employs\nmulti-scale deformable transformer decoder structure to enhance one modality\nfeature and count information by the other modality.

In this paper we present Hunter, an open source tool that automatically\ndetects performance regressions and improvements in time-series data. Hunter\nuses a modified E-divisive means algorithm to identify statistically\nsignificant changes in normally-distributed performance metrics. We describe\nthe changes we made to the E-divisive means algorithm along with their\nmotivation. The main change we adopted was to replace the significance test\nusing randomized permutations with a Student's t-test, as we discovered that\nthe randomized approach did not produce deterministic results, at least not\nwith a reasonable number of iterations. In addition we've made tweaks that\nallow us to find change points the original algorithm would not, such as two\nnearby changes. For evaluation, we developed a method to generate real\ntimeseries, but with artificially injected changes in latency. We used these\ndata sets to compare Hunter against two other well known algorithms, PELT and\nDYNP. Finally, we conclude with lessons we've learned supporting Hunter across\nteams with individual responsibility for the performance of their project.",

    "abstract": "The High-Resolution Transformer (HRFormer) can maintain high-resolution\nrepresentation and share global receptive fields. It is friendly towards\nsalient object detection (SOD) in which the input and output have the same\nresolution. However, two critical problems need to be solved for two-modality\nSOD. One problem is two-modality fusion. The other problem is the HRFormer\noutput's fusion. To address the first problem, a supplementary modality is\ninjected into the primary modality by using global optimization and an\nattention mechanism to select and purify the modality at the input level. To\nsolve the second problem, a dual-direction short connection fusion module is\nused to optimize the output features of HRFormer, thereby enhancing the\ndetailed representation of objects at the output level. The proposed model,\nnamed HRTransNet, first introduces an auxiliary stream for feature extraction\nof supplementary modality. Then, features are injected into the primary\nmodality at the beginning of each multi-resolution branch. Next, HRFormer is\napplied to achieve forwarding propagation. Finally, all the output features\nwith different resolutions are aggregated by intra-feature and inter-feature\ninteractive transformers. Application of the proposed model results in\nimpressive improvement for driving two-modality SOD tasks, e.g., RGB-D, RGB-T,\nand light field SOD.https://github.com/liuzywen/HRTransNet",

    "abstract": "Digital Twin (DT) technology is far from being comprehensive and mature,\nresulting in their piecemeal implementation in practice where some functions\nare automated by DTs, and others are still performed by humans. This piecemeal\nimplementation of DTs often leaves practitioners wondering what roles (or\nfunctions) to allocate to DTs in a work system, and how might it impact humans.\nA lack of knowledge about the roles that humans and DTs play in a work system\ncan result in significant costs, misallocation of resources, unrealistic\nexpectations from DTs, and strategic misalignments. To alleviate this\nchallenge, this paper answers the research question: When humans work with DTs,\nwhat types of roles can a DT play, and to what extent can those roles be\nautomated? Specifically, we propose a two-dimensional conceptual framework,\nLevels of Digital Twin (LoDT). The framework is an integration of the types of\nroles a DT can play, broadly categorized under (1) Observer, (2) Analyst, (3)\nDecision Maker, and (4) Action Executor, and the extent of automation for each\nof these roles, divided into five different levels ranging from completely\nmanual to fully automated. A particular DT can play any number of roles at\nvarying levels. The framework can help practitioners systematically plan DT\ndeployments, clearly communicate goals and deliverables, and lay out a\nstrategic vision.

In contrast to instance-level\ninformation, the similarity between two distinct images may provide more useful\ninformation. Besides, we analyze the relation between similarity loss and\nfeature-level cross-entropy loss. These two losses are essential for most deep\nlearning methods. However, the relation between these two losses is not clear.\nSimilarity loss helps obtain instance-level representation, while feature-level\ncross-entropy loss helps mine the similarity between two distinct images.

Nevertheless, existing works focus on\nthe frame-level (spatial) privacy preservation, ignoring the privacy leakage\nfrom a whole video and destroying the temporal continuity of actions. In this\npaper, we present a novel PPAR paradigm, i.e., performing privacy preservation\nfrom both spatial and temporal perspectives, and propose a STPrivacy framework.\nFor the first time, our STPrivacy applies vision Transformers to PPAR and\nregards a video as a sequence of spatio-temporal tubelets, showing outstanding\nadvantages over previous convolutional methods. Specifically, our STPrivacy\nadaptively treats privacy-containing tubelets in two different manners. The\ntubelets irrelevant to actions are directly abandoned, i.e., sparsification,\nand not published for subsequent tasks. In contrast, those highly involved in\nactions are anonymized, i.e., anonymization, to remove private information.\nThese two transformation mechanisms are complementary and simultaneously\noptimized in our unified framework. Because there is no large-scale benchmarks,\nwe annotate five privacy attributes for two of the most popular action\nrecognition datasets, i.e., HMDB51 and UCF101, and conduct extensive\nexperiments on them. Moreover, to verify the generalization ability of our\nSTPrivacy, we further introduce a privacy-preserving facial expression\nrecognition task and conduct experiments on a large-scale video facial\nattributes dataset, i.e., Celeb-VHQ.

    "abstract": "Many real-world data can be modeled as heterogeneous graphs that contain\nmultiple types of nodes and edges. Meanwhile, due to excellent performance,\nheterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs) have received more and more\nattention. However, the existing work mainly focuses on the design of novel GNN\nmodels, while ignoring another important issue that also has a large impact on\nthe model performance, namely the missing attributes of some node types. The\nhandcrafted attribute completion requires huge expert experience and domain\nknowledge. Also, considering the differences in semantic characteristics\nbetween nodes, the attribute completion should be fine-grained, i.e., the\nattribute completion operation should be node-specific. Moreover, to improve\nthe performance of the downstream graph learning task, attribute completion and\nthe training of the heterogeneous GNN should be jointly optimized rather than\nviewed as two separate processes. To address the above challenges, we propose a\ndifferentiable attribute completion framework called AutoAC for automated\ncompletion operation search in heterogeneous GNNs. We first propose an\nexpressive completion operation search space, including topology-dependent and\ntopology-independent completion operations. Then, we propose a continuous\nrelaxation schema and further propose a differentiable completion algorithm\nwhere the completion operation search is formulated as a bi-level joint\noptimization problem. To improve the search efficiency, we leverage two\noptimization techniques: discrete constraints and auxiliary unsupervised graph\nnode clustering.

To address this, a growing cadre of professional fact-checkers\nand journalists provide high-quality investigations into purported facts.\nHowever, these largely manual efforts have struggled to match the enormous\nscale of the problem. In response, a growing body of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) technologies have been proposed for more scalable\nfact-checking. Despite tremendous growth in such research, however, practical\nadoption of NLP technologies for fact-checking still remains in its infancy\ntoday.\nIn this work, we review the capabilities and limitations of the current NLP\ntechnologies for fact-checking.

To do so, we review key\naspects of NLP-based fact-checking: task formulation, dataset construction,\nmodeling, and human-centered strategies, such as explainable models and\nhuman-in-the-loop approaches. Next, we review the efficacy of applying\nNLP-based fact-checking tools to assist human fact-checkers. We recommend that\nfuture research include collaboration with fact-checker stakeholders early on\nin NLP research, as well as incorporation of human-centered design practices in\nmodel development, in order to further guide technology development for human\nuse and practical adoption.

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the challenging problem of on-demand federated\nlearning (FL) over heterogeneous edge devices with diverse resource\nconstraints. We propose a cost-adjustable FL framework, named AnycostFL, that\nenables diverse edge devices to efficiently perform local updates under a wide\nrange of efficiency constraints. To this end, we design the model shrinking to\nsupport local model training with elastic computation cost, and the gradient\ncompression to allow parameter transmission with dynamic communication\noverhead. An enhanced parameter aggregation is conducted in an element-wise\nmanner to improve the model performance. Focusing on AnycostFL, we further\npropose an optimization design to minimize the global training loss with\npersonalized latency and energy constraints. By revealing the theoretical\ninsights of the convergence analysis, personalized training strategies are\ndeduced for different devices to match their locally available resources.\nExperiment results indicate that, when compared to the state-of-the-art\nefficient FL algorithms, our learning framework can reduce up to 1.9 times of\nthe training latency and energy consumption for realizing a reasonable global\ntesting accuracy. Moreover, the results also demonstrate that, our approach\nsignificantly improves the converged global accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning technology has made it possible to generate realistic content\nof specific individuals. These `deepfakes' can now be generated in real-time\nwhich enables attackers to impersonate people over audio and video calls.\nMoreover, some methods only need a few images or seconds of audio to steal an\nidentity. Existing defenses perform passive analysis to detect fake content.\nHowever, with the rapid progress of deepfake quality, this may be a losing\ngame.\nIn this paper, we propose D-CAPTCHA: an active defense against real-time\ndeepfakes. The approach is to force the adversary into the spotlight by\nchallenging the deepfake model to generate content which exceeds its\ncapabilities. By doing so, passive detection becomes easier since the content\nwill be distorted. In contrast to existing CAPTCHAs, we challenge the AI's\nability to create content as opposed to its ability to classify content. In\nthis work we focus on real-time audio deepfakes and present preliminary results\non video.\nIn our evaluation we found that D-CAPTCHA outperforms state-of-the-art audio\ndeepfake detectors with an accuracy of 91-100% depending on the challenge\n(compared to 71% without challenges). We also performed a study on 41\nvolunteers to understand how threatening current real-time deepfake attacks\nare. We found that the majority of the volunteers could not tell the difference\nbetween real and fake audio.",

In this\npaper, we use the Perron-Frobenius operator in stochastic process to develop a\nPerron-Frobenius operator filter. The proposed method belongs to Bayesian\nfiltering and works for non-Gaussian distributions for nonlinear stochastic\ndynamical systems. The recursion of the filtering can be characterized by the\ncomposition of Perron-Frobenius operator and likelihood operator. This gives a\nsignificant connection between the Perron-Frobenius operator and Bayesian\nfiltering. We numerically fulfil the recursion through approximating the\nPerron-Frobenius operator by Ulam's method. In this way, the posterior measure\nis represented by a convex combination of the indicator functions in Ulam's\nmethod. To get a low rank approximation for the Perron-Frobenius operator\nfilter, we take a spectral decomposition for the posterior measure by using the\neigenfunctions of the discretized Perron-Frobenius operator. A convergence\nanalysis is carried out and shows that the Perron-Frobenius operator filter\nachieves a higher convergence rate than the particle filter, which uses Dirac\nmeasures for the posterior. The proposed method is explored for the data\nassimilation of the stochastic dynamical systems. A few numerical examples are\npresented to illustrate the advantage of the Perron-Frobenius operator filter\nover particle filter and extend Kalman filter.",

The best static tree for serving a sequence of queries (searches)\ncan be computed by dynamic programming. In contrast, when the BSTs are allowed\nto be dynamic (i.e. change by rotations between searches), we still do not know\nhow to compute the optimal algorithm (OPT) for a given sequence. One of the\ncandidate algorithms whose serving cost is suspected to be optimal up-to a\n(multiplicative) constant factor is known by the name Greedy Future (GF). In an\nequivalent geometric way of representing queries on BSTs, GF is in fact\nequivalent to another algorithm called Geometric Greedy (GG). Most of the\nresults on GF are obtained using the geometric model and the study of GG.\nDespite this intensive recent fruitful research, the best lower bound we have\non the competitive ratio of GF is $\\frac{4}{3}$. Furthermore, it has been\nconjectured that the additive gap between the cost of GF and OPT is only linear\nin the number of queries. In this paper we prove a lower bound of $2$ on the\ncompetitive ratio of GF, and we prove that the additive gap between the cost of\nGF and OPT can be $\\Omega(m \\cdot \\log\\log n)$ where $n$ is the number of items\nin the tree and $m$ is the number of queries.",

The proposed verification framework provides methods,\ntechniques and tool support for verifying composability at its different\nlevels.

In particular we focus on the\nDynamic-Semantic Composability level due to its significance in the overall\ncomposability correctness and also due to the level of difficulty it poses in\nthe process. In order to verify composability at this level we investigate the\napplication of three different approaches namely (i) Petri Nets based Algebraic\nAnalysis (ii) Colored Petri Nets (CPN) based State-space Analysis and (iii)\nCommunicating Sequential Processes based Model Checking.

Deep learning is a promising alternative to\ntraditional iterative solvers, but it has been used mostly in a supervised\nframework to regress the permittivity patterns from scattered fields or\nback-projections. While such methods are fast at test-time and achieve good\nresults for specific data distributions, they are sensitive to the distribution\ndrift of the scattered fields, common in practice. If the distribution of the\nscattered fields changes due to changes in frequency, the number of\ntransmitters and receivers, or any other real-world factor, an end-to-end\nneural network must be re-trained or fine-tuned on a new dataset. In this\npaper, we propose a new data-driven framework for inverse scattering based on\ndeep generative models. We model the target permittivities by a low-dimensional\nmanifold which acts as a regularizer and learned from data. Unlike supervised\nmethods which require both scattered fields and target signals, we only need\nthe target permittivities for training; it can then be used with any\nexperimental setup.

Our analysis guides our design of a\nseries of cinematic visualizations, created for NASA's Earth Science\nCommunications team. We present one as a case study to convey design guidelines\ncovering cinematography, lighting, set design, and sound, and discuss\nchallenges in creating cinematic visualizations.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial Training is the most effective approach for improving the\nrobustness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, compared to the large body\nof research in optimizing the adversarial training process, there are few\ninvestigations into how architecture components affect robustness, and they\nrarely constrain model capacity. Thus, it is unclear where robustness precisely\ncomes from. In this work, we present the first large-scale systematic study on\nthe robustness of DNN architecture components under fixed parameter budgets.\nThrough our investigation, we distill 18 actionable robust network design\nguidelines that empower model developers to gain deep insights. We demonstrate\nthese guidelines' effectiveness by introducing the novel Robust Architecture\n(RobArch) model that instantiates the guidelines to build a family of\ntop-performing models across parameter capacities against strong adversarial\nattacks. RobArch achieves the new state-of-the-art AutoAttack accuracy on the\nRobustBench ImageNet leaderboard.

    "abstract": "A general framework of unsupervised learning for combinatorial optimization\n(CO) is to train a neural network (NN) whose output gives a problem solution by\ndirectly optimizing the CO objective. Albeit with some advantages over\ntraditional solvers, the current framework optimizes an averaged performance\nover the distribution of historical problem instances, which misaligns with the\nactual goal of CO that looks for a good solution to every future encountered\ninstance. With this observation, we propose a new objective of unsupervised\nlearning for CO where the goal of learning is to search for good initialization\nfor future problem instances rather than give direct solutions. We propose a\nmeta-learning-based training pipeline for this new objective. Our method\nachieves go empirical performance. We observe that even just the initial\nsolution given by our model before fine-tuning can significantly outperform the\nbaselines under various evaluation settings including evaluation across\nmultiple datasets, and the case with big shifts in the problem scale. The\nreason we conjecture is that meta-learning-based training lets the model\nloosely tied to each local optima for a training instance while being more\nadaptive to the changes of optimization landscapes across instances.",

For example, we show how such a backdoored system can take any two\nimages of a particular person and decide that they represent different persons\n(an anonymity attack), or take any two images of a particular pair of persons\nand decide that they represent the same person (a confusion attack), with\nalmost no effect on the correctness of its decisions for other persons.\nUniquely, we show that multiple backdoors can be independently installed by\nmultiple attackers who may not be aware of each other's existence with almost\nno interference.\nWe have experimentally verified the attacks on a FaceNet-based facial\nrecognition system, which achieves SOTA accuracy on the standard LFW dataset of\n$99.35\\%$.

    "abstract": "Semantic communications learned on background knowledge bases (KBs) have been\nidentified as a promising technology for communications between intelligent\nagents. Existing works assume that transceivers of semantic communications\nshare the same KB. However, intelligent transceivers may suffer from the\ncommunication burden or worry about privacy leakage to exchange data in KBs.\nBesides, the transceivers may independently learn from the environment and\ndynamically update their KBs, leading to timely sharing of the KBs infeasible.\nAll these cause the mismatch between the KBs, which may result in a\nsemantic-level misunderstanding on the receiver side. To address this issue, we\npropose a transceiver cooperative learning-assisted semantic communication\n(TCL-SC) scheme against mismatched KBs. In TCL-SC, the transceivers\ncooperatively train semantic encoder and decoder neuron networks (NNs) of the\nsame structure based on their own KBs. They periodically share the parameters\nof NNs. To reduce the communication overhead of parameter sharing, parameter\nquantization is adopted. Moreover, we discuss the impacts of the number of\ncommunication rounds on the performance of semantic communication systems.\nExperiments on real-world data demonstrate that our proposed TCL-SC can reduce\nthe semantic-level misunderstanding on the receiver side caused by the mismatch\nbetween the KBs, especially at the low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio regime.",

Building upon past literature, the most recent works\nattempt to better capture sentiment from sentences with complex syntactic\nstructures by introducing aspect-level sentiment classification (ASC). Despite\nthe growing interest, however, fine-grained sentiment analysis has not been\nfully explored in non-English literature due to the shortage of annotated\nfinance-specific data. Accordingly, it is necessary for non-English languages\nto leverage datasets and pre-trained language models (PLM) of different\ndomains, languages, and tasks to best their performance. To facilitate\nfinance-specific ASC research in the Korean language, we build KorFinASC, a\nKorean aspect-level sentiment classification dataset for finance consisting of\n12,613 human-annotated samples, and explore methods of intermediate transfer\nlearning. Our experiments indicate that past research has been ignorant towards\nthe potentially wrong knowledge of financial entities encoded during the\ntraining phase, which has overestimated the predictive power of PLMs. In our\nwork, we use the term \"non-stationary knowledge'' to refer to information that\nwas previously correct but is likely to change, and present \"TGT-Masking'', a\nnovel masking pattern to restrict PLMs from speculating knowledge of the kind.\nFinally, through a series of transfer learning with TGT-Masking applied we\nimprove 22.63% of classification accuracy compared to standalone models on\nKorFinASC.",

The traditional optimization methods, requiring global channel\ninformation at a central controller, are not viable for high-mobility vehicular\nnetworks. To deal with this challenge, we propose a distributed multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) for resource allocation (RA). Each platoon\nleader, acting as an agent, can collaborate with other agents for joint\nsub-band selection and power allocation for its V2V links, and joint user\nassociation and power control for its V2I links. Moreover, each platoon can\ndynamically select the vehicle most suitable to be the platoon leader. We aim\nto maximize the V2V and V2I packet delivery probability in the desired latency\nusing the deep Q-learning algorithm. Simulation results indicate that our\nproposed MARL outperforms the centralized hill-climbing algorithm, and platoon\nleader selection helps to improve both V2V and V2I performance.",

    "abstract": "Facing growing concerns about power consumption and carbon emissions, cloud\nproviders are adapting datacenter loads to reduce carbon emissions. With\ndatacenters exceeding 100MW, they can affect grid dynamics, so doing this\nwithout damaging grid performance is difficult.\nWe study power adaptation algorithms that use grid metrics and seek to reduce\ndatacenter (DC) operational carbon emissions. First, we consider local, online\nadaptation. Second, to reduce grid disruption that can arise from adaptation,\nwe consider using an external coordinator that limits aggregate impact.\nFinally, we study a novel cooperative scheme, where datacenters first create a\nfull-day adapted power plan, based on day-ahead information, and then share it\nwith the power grid. This novel approach is a partnership that reflects the\nshared responsibility between datacenter and the grid for carbon minimization.\nFor each, we report DC carbon emissions reduction and grid impacts.\nResults show that PlanShare, the novel cooperative scheme is superior to all\nonline approaches considered, achieving a net benefit of 12.6% reduction in\ndatacenter operational carbon emissions. PlanShare achieves 26%--132% better\nperformance than the best online approach, and far larger for many. This\nbenefit arises from allowing the grid optimization with full future DC load\ninformation. Further it enables efficient DC resource management with a 24-hour\ncapacity schedule.

While providing many advantages over traditional\nclassification models, such as naturally handling censoring, time-to-event\nmodels require more parameters and are challenging to learn in settings with\nlimited labeled training data. High censoring rates, common in events with long\ntime horizons, further limit available training data and exacerbate the risk of\noverfitting. Existing methods, such as proportional hazard or accelerated\nfailure time-based approaches, employ distributional assumptions to reduce\nparameter size, but they are vulnerable to model misspecification. In this\nwork, we address these challenges with MOTOR, a self-supervised model that\nleverages temporal structure found in large-scale collections of timestamped,\nbut largely unlabeled events, typical of electronic health record data. MOTOR\ndefines a time-to-event pretraining task that naturally captures the\nprobability distribution of event times, making it well-suited to applications\nin medicine. After pretraining on 8,192 tasks auto-generated from 2.7M patients\n(2.4B clinical events), we evaluate the performance of our pretrained model\nafter fine-tuning to unseen time-to-event tasks. MOTOR-derived models improve\nupon current state-of-the-art C statistic performance by 6.6% and decrease\ntraining time (in wall time) by up to 8.2 times. We further improve sample\nefficiency, with adapted models matching current state-of-the-art performance\nusing 95% less training data.",

Existing approaches for PNG are mainly based on a two-stage\nparadigm, which is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a\none-stage network for real-time PNG, termed End-to-End Panoptic Narrative\nGrounding network (EPNG), which directly generates masks for referents.\nSpecifically, we propose two innovative designs, i.e., Locality-Perceptive\nAttention (LPA) and a bidirectional Semantic Alignment Loss (SAL), to properly\nhandle the many-to-many relationship between textual expressions and visual\nobjects. LPA embeds the local spatial priors into attention modeling, i.e., a\npixel may belong to multiple masks at different scales, thereby improving\nsegmentation. To help understand the complex semantic relationships, SAL\nproposes a bidirectional contrastive objective to regularize the semantic\nconsistency inter modalities. Extensive experiments on the PNG benchmark\ndataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Compared to\nthe single-stage baseline, our method achieves a significant improvement of up\nto 9.4% accuracy. More importantly, our EPNG is 10 times faster than the\ntwo-stage model.

Experiments show that\nBSR is able to save up to 11.7% more energy compared with the current best\nenergy saving optimization approach with no performance degradation and up to\n14.1% Energy * Delay^2 reduction.

In this paper, we deeply investigate\nthe various backbone networks (e.g.CNN and Transformer models) toward the\ngeneralization of monocular depth estimation. First, we evaluate\nstate-of-the-art models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution\ndatasets, which have never been seen during network training. Then, we\ninvestigate the internal properties of the representations from the\nintermediate layers of CNN-/Transformer-based models using synthetic\ntexture-shifted datasets. Through extensive experiments, we observe that the\nTransformers exhibit a strong shape-bias rather than CNNs, which have a strong\ntexture-bias. We also discover that texture-biased models exhibit worse\ngeneralization performance for monocular depth estimation than shape-biased\nmodels. We demonstrate that similar aspects are observed in real-world driving\ndatasets captured under diverse environments.

As one can recover a causal graph only up\nto its Markov equivalence class from observations, interventions are often used\nfor the recovery task. Interventions are costly in general and it is important\nto design algorithms that minimize the number of interventions performed.\nIn this work, we study the problem of learning the causal relationships of a\nsubset of edges (target edges) in a graph with as few interventions as\npossible. Under the assumptions of faithfulness, causal sufficiency, and ideal\ninterventions, we study this problem in two settings: when the underlying\nground truth causal graph is known (subset verification) and when it is unknown\n(subset search).\nFor the subset verification problem, we provide an efficient algorithm to\ncompute a minimum sized interventional set; we further extend these results to\nbounded size non-atomic interventions and node-dependent interventional costs.\nFor the subset search problem, in the worst case, we show that no algorithm\n(even with adaptivity or randomization) can achieve an approximation ratio that\nis asymptotically better than the vertex cover of the target edges when\ncompared with the subset verification number.

These shadow remnants typically exist in homogeneous regions\nwith low intensity values, making them untraceable in the existing\nimage-to-image mapping paradigm. We observe from our experiments that shadows\nmainly degrade object colors at the image structure level (in which humans\nperceive object outlines filled with continuous colors). Hence, in this paper,\nwe propose to remove shadows at the image structure level. Based on this idea,\nwe propose a novel structure-informed shadow removal network (StructNet) to\nleverage the image structure information to address the shadow remnant problem.\nSpecifically, StructNet first reconstructs the structure information of the\ninput image without shadows and then uses the restored shadow-free structure\nprior to guiding the image-level shadow removal. StructNet contains two main\nnovel modules: (1) a mask-guided shadow-free extraction (MSFE) module to\nextract image structural features in a non-shadow to shadow directional manner,\nand (2) a multi-scale feature & residual aggregation (MFRA) module to leverage\nthe shadow-free structure information to regularize feature consistency.

    "abstract": "Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are a promising key technology\nfor future wireless communication. However, improving their signal detection\nperformance is still challenging to further increase the wireless transmission\nefficiency. To address this challenge, we propose to intentionally extend the\ndiscrete signal detection problem in MIMO systems to a continuous one and to\nutilize the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method, a type of efficient Markov chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC). We already presented the use of a mixture of normal\ndistribution for the prior distribution based on the same approach. This paper\nproposes the application of a mixture of t-distribution that further improves\ndetection performance. We show that the proposed method can achieve\nnear-optimal signal detection with a polynomial order computational complexity\nthrough theoretical analysis and computer simulation. The proposed\nhigh-performance and pragmatic MIMO signal detection should significantly\ncontribute to developing the 6th-generation mobile network.",

Neural computational principles inspire new intelligent machines,\nwhich are in turn used to advance theoretical understanding of the brain. To\npromote further exchange of ideas and collaboration between biological and\nartificial intelligence researchers, we introduce the 2023 installment of the\nAlgonauts Project challenge: How the Human Brain Makes Sense of Natural Scenes\n(this http URL). This installment prompts the fields of\nartificial and biological intelligence to come together towards building\ncomputational models of the visual brain using the largest and richest dataset\nof fMRI responses to visual scenes, the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD). NSD\nprovides high-quality fMRI responses to ~73,000 different naturalistic colored\nscenes, making it the ideal candidate for data-driven model building approaches\npromoted by the 2023 challenge. The challenge is open to all and makes results\ndirectly comparable and transparent through a public leaderboard automatically\nupdated after each submission, thus allowing for rapid model development. We\nbelieve that the 2023 installment will spark symbiotic collaborations between\nbiological and artificial intelligence scientists, leading to a deeper\nunderstanding of the brain through cutting-edge computational models and to\nnovel ways of engineering artificial intelligent agents through inductive\nbiases from biological systems.",

However, highly\ndirectional and adaptive beamforming in today's mmWave systems have opened new\npossibilities for self-backhauling. Tapping into this potential, 3GPP has\nstandardized Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) allowing the same base\nstation serve both access and backhaul traffic. Although much more\ncost-effective and flexible, resource allocation and path selection in IAB\nmmWave networks is a formidable task.

We propose Safehaul, a risk-averse learning-based solution for IAB\nmmWave networks. In addition to optimizing average performance, Safehaul\nensures reliability by minimizing the losses in the tail of the performance\ndistribution. We develop a novel simulator and show via extensive simulations\nthat Safehaul not only reduces the latency by up to 43.2% compared to the\nbenchmarks but also exhibits significantly more reliable performance (e.g.,\n71.4% less variance in achieved latency).",

Our sliding MI extends standard MI by iteratively inverting\noverlapping chunks of the audio samples and thereby leveraging the sequential\nproperties of audio data for enhanced inversion performance. We show that one\ncan use the inverted audio data to generate spoofed audio samples to\nimpersonate a speaker, and execute voice-protected commands for highly secured\nsystems on their behalf.

Recent regulations like the European GDPR\nprovide rules for the processing of personal and sensitive data, like that no\nsuch data may be leaked without the consent of the user.\nResearchers have proposed sophisticated approaches to track sensitive data\nwithin mobile apps, all of which rely on specific lists of sensitive source and\nsink API methods. The data flow analysis results greatly depend on these lists'\nquality. Previous approaches either used incomplete hand-written lists that\nquickly became outdated or relied on machine learning. The latter, however,\nleads to numerous false positives, as we show.\nThis paper introduces CoDoC, a tool that aims to revive the machine-learning\napproach to precisely identify privacy-related source and sink API methods. In\ncontrast to previous approaches, CoDoC uses deep learning techniques and\ncombines the source code with the documentation of API methods. Firstly, we\npropose novel definitions that clarify the concepts of sensitive source and\nsink methods. Secondly, based on these definitions, we build a new ground truth\nof Android methods representing sensitive source, sink, and neither (i.e., no\nsource or sink) methods that will be used to train our classifier.\nWe evaluate CoDoC and show that, on our validation dataset, it achieves a\nprecision, recall, and F1 score of 91% in 10-fold cross-validation,\noutperforming the state-of-the-art SuSi when used on the same dataset. However,\nsimilarly to existing tools, we show that in the wild, i.e., with unseen data,\nCoDoC performs poorly and generates many false positive results.

Egocentric video has several\ndistinguishing characteristics from those commonly found in past datasets:\nfrequent large camera motions and hand interactions with objects commonly lead\nto occlusions or objects exiting the frame, and object appearance can change\nrapidly due to widely different points of view, scale, or object states.\nEmbodied tracking is also naturally long-term, and being able to consistently\n(re-)associate objects to their appearances and disappearances over as long as\na lifetime is critical. Previous datasets under-emphasize this re-detection\nproblem, and their \"framed\" nature has led to adoption of various\nspatiotemporal priors that we find do not necessarily generalize to egocentric\nvideo. We thus introduce EgoTracks, a new dataset for long-term egocentric\nvisual object tracking. Sourced from the Ego4D dataset, this new dataset\npresents a significant challenge to recent state-of-the-art single-object\ntracking models, which we find score poorly on traditional tracking metrics for\nour new dataset, compared to popular benchmarks.

An accelerated form of the HPM is combined with the\nElzaki transformation to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the method. One\nof the significant advantages of the technique lies over the classic numerical\nmethods as it allows solving the linear and non-linear differential equations\nwithout discretization. Further, it has benefits over the existing\nsemi-analytical techniques such as Adomian decomposition method (ADM),\noptimized decomposition method (ODM), and homotopy analysis method (HAM) in the\nsense that computation of Adomian polynomials and convergence parameters are\nnot required. The novelty of the scheme is shown by comparing the numerical\nfindings with the existing results obtained via ADM, HPM, HAM and ODM for\nnon-linear coagulation equation. This motivates us to extend the scheme for\nsolving the other models mentioned above. The supremacy of the proposed scheme\nis demonstrated by taking several numerical examples for each problem.

However, due to the instability of AIGC models, e.g.,\nthe stochastic nature of diffusion models, the quality and accuracy of the\ngenerated content can vary significantly. In wireless edge networks, the\ntransmission of incorrectly generated content may unnecessarily consume network\nresources. Thus, a dynamic AIGC service provider (ASP) selection scheme is\nrequired to enable users to connect to the most suited ASP, improving the\nusers' satisfaction and quality of generated content. In this article, we first\nreview the AIGC techniques and their applications in wireless networks. We then\npresent the AIGC-as-a-service (AaaS) concept and discuss the challenges in\ndeploying AaaS at the edge networks. Yet, it is essential to have performance\nmetrics to evaluate the accuracy of AIGC services. Thus, we introduce several\nimage-based perceived quality evaluation metrics. Then, we propose a general\nand effective model to illustrate the relationship between computational\nresources and user-perceived quality evaluation metrics. To achieve efficient\nAaaS and maximize the quality of generated content in wireless edge networks,\nwe propose a deep reinforcement learning-enabled algorithm for optimal ASP\nselection.

The Dafny system is a prominent example of\nthat trend. However, little evidence exists yet about its accessibility.

In this work, we train\ndeep reversible Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to perform flow sensing (flow\nreconstruction) around two-dimensional aerodynamic shapes: airfoils. Motivated\nby recent work, which has shown that GNNs can be powerful alternatives to\nmesh-based forward physics simulators, we implement a Message-Passing Neural\nNetwork to simultaneously reconstruct both the pressure and velocity fields\nsurrounding simulated airfoils based on their surface pressure distributions,\nwhilst additionally gathering useful farfield properties in the form of context\nvectors. We generate a unique dataset of Computational Fluid Dynamics\nsimulations by simulating random, yet meaningful combinations of input boundary\nconditions and airfoil shapes. We show that despite the challenges associated\nwith reconstructing the flow around arbitrary airfoil geometries in high\nReynolds turbulent inflow conditions, our framework is able to generalize well\nto unseen cases.",

Therefore, it is\nimportant to quantify the resilience of existing cellular network\ninfrastructures against potential risks, ranging from natural disasters to\nsecurity attacks, that might occur with a low probability but can lead to\nsevere disruption of the services. In this paper, we combine models with public\ndata from national bodies on mobile network operator (MNO) infrastructures,\npopulation distribution, and urbanity level to assess the coverage and capacity\nof a cellular network at a country scale. Our analysis offers insights on the\npotential weak points that need improvement to ensure a low fraction of\ndisconnected population (FDP) and high fraction of satisfied population (FSP).\nAs a resilience improvement approach, we investigate in which regions and to\nwhat extent each MNO can benefit from infrastructure sharing or national\nroaming, i.e., all MNOs act as a single national operator. As our case study,\nwe focus on Dutch cellular infrastructure and model risks as random failures,\ncorrelated failures in a geographic region, and abrupt increase in the number\nof users. Our analysis shows that there is a wide performance difference across\nMNOs and geographic regions in terms of FDP and FSP.

Active Learning (AL) is a technique developed to reduce the amount of\nannotation required to achieve a certain level of machine learning model\nperformance.

With the recent\nadvances in deep learning (DL), an increasing number of APR techniques have\nbeen proposed to leverage neural networks to learn bug-fixing patterns from\nmassive open-source code repositories. Such learning-based techniques usually\ntreat APR as a neural machine translation (NMT) task, where buggy code snippets\n(i.e., source language) are translated into fixed code snippets (i.e., target\nlanguage) automatically. Benefiting from the powerful capability of DL to learn\nhidden relationships from previous bug-fixing datasets, learning-based APR\ntechniques have achieved remarkable performance. In this paper, we provide a\nsystematic survey to summarize the current state-of-the-art research in the\nlearning-based APR community. We illustrate the general workflow of\nlearning-based APR techniques and detail the crucial components, including\nfault localization, patch generation, patch ranking, patch validation, and\npatch correctness phases. We then discuss the widely-adopted datasets and\nevaluation metrics and outline existing empirical studies. We discuss several\ncritical aspects of learning-based APR techniques, such as repair domains,\nindustrial deployment, and the open science issue. We highlight several\npractical guidelines on applying DL techniques for future APR studies, such as\nexploring explainable patch generation and utilizing code features. Overall,\nour paper can help researchers gain a comprehensive understanding about the\nachievements of the existing learning-based APR techniques and promote the\npractical application of these techniques.

Leveraging\non some Pareto optimizers, recent work has shifted from tuning for a single,\ntime-related performance objective to two intrinsically different objectives\nthat assess distinct performance aspects of the system, each with varying\naspirations. Before we design better optimizers, a crucial engineering decision\nto make therein is how to handle the performance requirements with clear\naspirations in the tuning process. For this, the community takes two\nalternative optimization models: either quantifying and incorporating the\naspirations into the search objectives that guide the tuning, or not\nconsidering the aspirations during the search but purely using them in the\nlater decision-making process only. However, despite being a crucial decision\nthat determines how an optimizer can be designed and tailored, there is a\nrather limited understanding of which optimization model should be chosen under\nwhat particular circumstance, and why.\nIn this paper, we seek to close this gap. Firstly, we do that through a\nreview of over 426 papers in the literature and 14 real-world requirements\ndatasets. Drawing on these, we then conduct a comprehensive empirical study\nthat covers 15 combinations of the state-of-the-art performance requirement\npatterns, four types of aspiration space, three Pareto optimizers, and eight\nreal-world systems/environments, leading to 1,296 cases of investigation. We\nfound that (1) the realism of aspirations is the key factor that determines\nwhether they should be used to guide the tuning; (2) the given patterns and the\nposition of the realistic aspirations in the objective landscape are less\nimportant for the choice, but they do matter to the extents of improvement; (3)\nthe available tuning budget can also influence the choice for unrealistic\naspirations but it is insignificant under realistic ones.",

Such practices may threaten democracy by distorting the truth and\nmisleading readers about the nature of events. This paper proposes a novel\nsystem for detecting, processing, and warning users about misleading content\nonline to combat the threats posed by misinformation. By training a machine\nlearning model on an existing dataset of 32,000 clickbait news article\nheadlines, the model predicts how sensationalist a headline is and then\ninterfaces with a web browser extension which constructs a unique content\nwarning notification based on existing design principles and incorporates the\nmodels' prediction. This research makes a novel contribution to machine\nlearning and human-centred security with promising findings for future\nresearch. By warning users when they may be viewing misinformation, it is\npossible to prevent spontaneous reactions, helping users to take a deep breath\nand approach online media with a clear mind.",

    "abstract": "A two-player game-theoretic problem on resilient graphs in a multiagent\nconsensus setting is formulated. An attacker is capable to disable some of the\nedges of the network with the objective to divide the agents into clusters by\nemitting jamming signals while, in response, the defender recovers some of the\nedges by increasing the transmission power for the communication signals.\nSpecifically, we consider repeated games between the attacker and the defender\nwhere the optimal strategies for the two players are derived in a rolling\nhorizon fashion based on utility functions that take both the agents' states\nand the sizes of clusters (known as network effect) into account. The players'\nactions at each discrete-time step are constrained by their energy for\ntransmissions of the signals, with a less strict constraint for the attacker.\nNecessary conditions and sufficient conditions of agent consensus are derived,\nwhich are influenced by the energy constraints. The number of clusters of\nagents at infinite time in the face of attacks and recoveries are also\ncharacterized. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effects of\nplayers' actions on the cluster forming and to illustrate the players'\nperformance for different horizon parameters.",

In this paper, we present a novel formulation of combinatorial\noptimization (CO) problems as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) that effectively\nleverages symmetries of the CO problems to improve out-of-distribution\nrobustness. Starting from the standard MDP formulation of constructive\nheuristics, we introduce a generic transformation based on bisimulation\nquotienting (BQ) in MDPs. This transformation allows to reduce the state space\nby accounting for the intrinsic symmetries of the CO problem and facilitates\nthe MDP solving.

We present a BQ\nreformulation of these problems and introduce a simple attention-based policy\nnetwork that we train by imitation of (near) optimal solutions for small\ninstances from a single distribution.

    "abstract": "The goal of constrained multiobjective evolutionary optimization is to obtain\na set of well-converged and welldistributed feasible solutions. To complete\nthis goal, there should be a tradeoff among feasibility, diversity, and\nconvergence. However, it is nontrivial to balance these three elements\nsimultaneously by using a single tradeoff model since the importance of each\nelement varies in different evolutionary phases. As an alternative, we adapt\ndifferent tradeoff models in different phases and propose a novel algorithm\ncalled ATM-R. In the infeasible phase, ATM-R takes the tradeoff between\ndiversity and feasibility into account, aiming to move the population toward\nfeasible regions from diverse search directions. In the semi-feasible phase,\nATM-R promotes the transition from \"the tradeoff between feasibility and\ndiversity\" to \"the tradeoff between diversity and convergence\", which can\nfacilitate the discovering of enough feasible regions and speed up the search\nfor the feasible Pareto optima in succession. In the feasible phase, the\ntradeoff between diversity and convergence is considered to attain a set of\nwell-converged and well-distributed feasible solutions. It is worth noting that\nthe merits of reference points are leveraged in ATM-R to accomplish these\ntradeoff models. Also, in ATM-R, a multiphase mating selection strategy is\ndeveloped to generate promising solutions beneficial to different evolutionary\nphases. Systemic experiments on a wide range of benchmark test functions\ndemonstrate that ATM-R is effective and competitive, compared against five\nstate-of-the-art constrained multiobjective optimization evolutionary\nalgorithms.",

    "abstract": "Recent attempts mainly focus on learning deep representations for each video\nindividually under the episodic meta-learning regime and then performing\ntemporal alignment to match query and support videos. However, they still\nsuffer from two drawbacks: (i) learning individual features without considering\nthe entire task may result in limited representation capability, and (ii)\nexisting alignment strategies are sensitive to noises and misaligned instances.\nTo handle the two limitations, we propose a novel Hybrid Relation guided\ntemporal Set Matching (HyRSM++) approach for few-shot action recognition. The\ncore idea of HyRSM++ is to integrate all videos within the task to learn\ndiscriminative representations and involve a robust matching technique. To be\nspecific, HyRSM++ consists of two key components, a hybrid relation module and\na temporal set matching metric. Given the basic representations from the\nfeature extractor, the hybrid relation module is introduced to fully exploit\nassociated relations within and cross videos in an episodic task and thus can\nlearn task-specific embeddings. Subsequently, in the temporal set matching\nmetric, we carry out the distance measure between query and support videos from\na set matching perspective and design a Bi-MHM to improve the resilience to\nmisaligned instances. In addition, we explicitly exploit the temporal coherence\nin videos to regularize the matching process. Furthermore, we extend the\nproposed HyRSM++ to deal with the more challenging semi-supervised few-shot\naction recognition and unsupervised few-shot action recognition tasks.\nExperimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance under various few-shot settings.

    "abstract": "The dominating waveform in 5G is orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\n(OFDM). OFDM will remain a promising waveform candidate for joint communication\nand sensing (JCAS) in 6G since OFDM can provide excellent data transmission\ncapability and accurate sensing information. This paper proposes a novel\nOFDM-based diagonal waveform structure and corresponding signal processing\nalgorithm. This approach allocates the sensing signals along the diagonal of\nthe time-frequency resource block. Therefore, the sensing signals in a linear\nstructure span both the frequency and time domains. The range and velocity of\nthe object can be estimated simultaneously by applying 1D-discrete Fourier\ntransform (DFT) to the diagonal sensing signals. Compared to the conventional\n2D-DFT OFDM radar algorithm, the computational complexity of the proposed\nalgorithm is low. In addition, the sensing overhead can be substantially\nreduced. The performance of the proposed waveform is evaluated using simulation\nand analysis of results.",

    "abstract": "Human infant learning happens during exploration of the environment, by\ninteraction with objects, and by listening to and repeating utterances\ncasually, which is analogous to unsupervised learning. Only occasionally, a\nlearning infant would receive a matching verbal description of an action it is\ncommitting, which is similar to supervised learning. Such a learning mechanism\ncan be mimicked with deep learning. We model this weakly supervised learning\nparadigm using our Paired Gated Autoencoders (PGAE) model, which combines an\naction and a language autoencoder. After observing a performance drop when\nreducing the proportion of supervised training, we introduce the Paired\nTransformed Autoencoders (PTAE) model, using Transformer-based crossmodal\nattention. PTAE achieves significantly higher accuracy in language-to-action\nand action-to-language translations, particularly in realistic but difficult\ncases when only few supervised training samples are available. We also test\nwhether the trained model behaves realistically with conflicting multimodal\ninput. In accordance with the concept of incongruence in psychology, conflict\ndeteriorates the model output. Conflicting action input has a more severe\nimpact than conflicting language input, and more conflicting features lead to\nlarger interference. PTAE can be trained on mostly unlabelled data where\nlabeled data is scarce, and it behaves plausibly when tested with incongruent\ninput.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study a network slicing problem for edge-cloud orchestrated\nvehicular networks, in which the edge and cloud servers are orchestrated to\nprocess computation tasks for reducing network slicing cost while satisfying\nthe quality of service requirements. We propose a two-stage network slicing\nframework, which consists of 1) network planning stage in a large timescale to\nperform slice deployment, edge resource provisioning, and cloud resource\nprovisioning, and 2) network operation stage in a small timescale to perform\nresource allocation and task dispatching. Particularly, we formulate the\nnetwork slicing problem as a two-timescale stochastic optimization problem to\nminimize the network slicing cost. Since the problem is NP-hard due to coupled\nnetwork planning and network operation stages, we develop a Two timescAle\nnetWork Slicing (TAWS) algorithm by collaboratively integrating reinforcement\nlearning (RL) and optimization methods, which can jointly make network planning\nand operation decisions. Specifically, by leveraging the timescale separation\nproperty of decisions, we decouple the problem into a large-timescale network\nplanning subproblem and a small-timescale network operation subproblem. The\nformer is solved by an RL method, and the latter is solved by an optimization\nmethod. Simulation results based on real-world vehicle traffic traces show that\nthe TAWS can effectively reduce the network slicing cost as compared to the\nbenchmark scheme.",

As buildings consume one-third of global\nenergy and almost half of this energy accounts for Heating, Ventilation, and\nAir Conditioning (HVAC) systems, HVAC are suitable for shifting their\nelectricity consumption in time. To this end, intelligent control strategies\nare necessary as the conventional control of HVAC is not optimized for the\nactual demand of occupants and the current situation in the electricity grid.\nIn this paper, we present the novel multi-zone controller Price Storage Control\n(PSC) that not only considers room-individual Occupants' Thermal Satisfaction\n(OTS), but also the available energy storage, and energy prices. The main\nfeature of PSC is that it does not need a building model or forecasts of future\ndemands to derive the control actions for multiple rooms in a building. For\ncomparison, we use an ideal, error-free Model Predictive Control (MPC) and a\nconventional hysteresis-based two-point control as upper and lower benchmarks,\nrespectively. We evaluate the three controllers in a multizone environment for\ncooling a building in summer and consider two different scenarios that differ\nin how much the permitted temperatures vary. The results show that PSC strongly\noutperforms the conventional control approach in both scenarios with regard to\nthe electricity costs and OTS. It leads to 50% costs reduction and 15% comfort\nimprovements while the ideal MPC achieves costs reductions of 58% and comfort\nimprovements of 29%. Considering that PSC does not need any building model or\nforecast, as opposed to MPC, the results support the suitability of our\ndeveloped control strategy for controlling HVAC systems in future energy\nsystems.",

Second,\nwe analyze the discrete equivalent of the equation in a tensor product and show\nconditional stability, i.e. a CFL condition. Understanding the vectorial wave\nequation and the corresponding space-time finite element methods is crucial for\nimproving the existing theory of Maxwell's equations and paves the way to\ncomputations of more complicated electromagnetic problems.",

    "abstract": "Computational complexity is a core theory of computer science, which dictates\nthe degree of difficulty of computation. There are many problems with high\ncomplexity that we have to deal, which is especially true for AI. This raises a\nbig question: Is there a better way to deal with these highly complex problems\nother than bounded by computational complexity? We believe that ideas and\nmethods from intelligence science can be applied to these problems and help us\nto exceed computational complexity. In this paper, we try to clarify concepts,\nand we propose definitions such as unparticularized computing, particularized\ncomputing, computing agents, and dynamic search. We also propose and discuss a\nframework, i.e., trial-and-error + dynamic search.

    "title": "Asynchronous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Real-Time  Multi-Robot Cooperative Exploration",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of cooperative exploration where multiple robots need\nto cooperatively explore an unknown region as fast as possible. Multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) has recently become a trending paradigm for\nsolving this challenge. However, existing MARL-based methods adopt\naction-making steps as the metric for exploration efficiency by assuming all\nthe agents are acting in a fully synchronous manner: i.e., every single agent\nproduces an action simultaneously and every single action is executed\ninstantaneously at each time step. Despite its mathematical simplicity, such a\nsynchronous MARL formulation can be problematic for real-world robotic\napplications. It can be typical that different robots may take slightly\ndifferent wall-clock times to accomplish an atomic action or even periodically\nget lost due to hardware issues. Simply waiting for every robot being ready for\nthe next action can be particularly time-inefficient. Therefore, we propose an\nasynchronous MARL solution, Asynchronous Coordination Explorer (ACE), to tackle\nthis real-world challenge. We first extend a classical MARL algorithm,\nmulti-agent PPO (MAPPO), to the asynchronous setting and additionally apply\naction-delay randomization to enforce the learned policy to generalize better\nto varying action delays in the real world. Moreover, each navigation agent is\nrepresented as a team-size-invariant CNN-based policy, which greatly benefits\nreal-robot deployment by handling possible robot lost and allows\nbandwidth-efficient intra-agent communication through low-dimensional CNN\nfeatures. We first validate our approach in a grid-based scenario. Both\nsimulation and real-robot results show that ACE reduces over 10% actual\nexploration time compared with classical approaches. We also apply our\nframework to a high-fidelity visual-based environment, Habitat, achieving 28%\nimprovement in exploration efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Understanding event relationships in videos requires a model to understand\nthe underlying structures of events, i.e., the event type, the associated\nargument roles, and corresponding entities) along with factual knowledge needed\nfor reasoning. Structural symbolic representation (SSR) based methods directly\ntake event types and associated argument roles/entities as inputs to perform\nreasoning.\nHowever, the state-of-the-art video event-relation prediction system shows\nthe necessity of using continuous feature vectors from input videos; existing\nmethods based solely on SSR inputs fail completely, event when given oracle\nevent types and argument roles. In this paper, we conduct an extensive\nempirical analysis to answer the following questions: 1) why SSR-based method\nfailed; 2) how to understand the evaluation setting of video event relation\nprediction properly; 3) how to uncover the potential of SSR-based methods. We\nfirst identify the failure of previous SSR-based video event prediction models\nto be caused by sub-optimal training settings. Surprisingly, we find that a\nsimple SSR-based model with tuned hyperparameters can actually yield a 20\\%\nabsolute improvement in macro-accuracy over the state-of-the-art model. Then\nthrough qualitative and quantitative analysis, we show how evaluation that\ntakes only video as inputs is currently unfeasible, and the reliance on oracle\nevent information to obtain an accurate evaluation. Based on these findings, we\npropose to further contextualize the SSR-based model to an Event-Sequence Model\nand equip it with more factual knowledge through a simple yet effective way of\nreformulating external visual commonsense knowledge bases into an\nevent-relation prediction pretraining dataset.

Optimizing the performance of cellular\nnetworks and providing massive connectivity with improved coverage and user\nexperience has a considerable social and economic impact on our daily life.\nThis performance relies heavily on the configuration of the network parameters.\nHowever, with the massive increase in both the size and complexity of cellular\nnetworks, network management, especially parameter configuration, is becoming\ncomplicated. The current practice, which relies largely on experts' prior\nknowledge, is not adequate and will require lots of domain experts and high\nmaintenance costs. In this work, we propose a learning-based framework for\nhandover parameter configuration. The key challenge, in this case, is to tackle\nthe complicated dependencies between neighboring cells and jointly optimize the\nwhole network. Our framework addresses this challenge in two ways. First, we\nintroduce a novel approach to imitate how the network responds to different\nnetwork states and parameter values, called auto-grouping graph convolutional\nnetwork (AG-GCN). During the parameter configuration stage, instead of solving\nthe global optimization problem, we design a local multi-objective optimization\nstrategy where each cell considers several local performance metrics to balance\nits own performance and its neighbors. We evaluate our proposed algorithm via a\nsimulator constructed using real network data. We demonstrate that the handover\nparameters our model can find, achieve better average network throughput\ncompared to those recommended by experts as well as alternative baselines,\nwhich can bring better network quality and stability.

We first prove that the\ndicolouring graph of any digraph $D$ on $k\\geq 2\\delta_{\\min}^*(D) + 2$ colours\nhas linear diameter, extending a result from Bousquet and Perarnau. We also\nprove that the conjecture is true when $k\\geq\n\\frac{3}{2}(\\delta_{\\min}^*(D)+1)$. Restricted to the special case of oriented\ngraphs, we prove that the dicolouring graph of any subcubic oriented graph on\n$k\\geq 2$ colours is connected and has diameter at most $2n$. We conjecture\nthat every non $2$-mixing oriented graph has maximum average degree at least\n$4$, and we provide some support for this conjecture by proving it on the\nspecial case of $2$-freezable oriented graphs. More generally, we show that\nevery $k$-freezable oriented graph on $n$ vertices must contain at least $kn +\nk(k-2)$ arcs, and we give a family of $k$-freezable oriented graphs that reach\nthis bound. In the general case, we prove as a partial result that every non\n$2$-mixing oriented graph has maximum average degree at least $\\frac{7}{2}$.",

The training data is\ngenerated in an unsupervised manner by assigning a continuous label to\nindividual points by exploiting multiple time slices of the same environment.\nInstead of using discrete labels, i.e. static/dynamic, we propose to use a\ncontinuous label value indicating point temporal stability to train a\nregression PointNet++ network. We evaluated our approach on point cloud data of\ntwo parking lots from the NCLT dataset.

Planet-CR is the first public dataset for cloud removal to feature\nglobally sampled high resolution optical observations, in combination with\npaired radar measurements as well as pixel-level land cover annotations. It\nprovides solid basis for exhaustive evaluation in terms of generating visually\npleasing textures and semantically meaningful structures. With this dataset, we\nconsider the problem of cloud removal in high resolution optical remote sensing\nimagery by integrating multi-modal and multi-resolution information. Existing\nmulti-modal data fusion based methods, which assume the image pairs are aligned\npixel-to-pixel, are hence not appropriate for this problem. To this end, we\ndesign a new baseline named Align-CR to perform the low-resolution SAR image\nguided high-resolution optical image cloud removal. It implicitly aligns the\nmulti-modal and multi-resolution data during the reconstruction process to\npromote the cloud removal performance. The experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed Align-CR method gives the best performance in both visual\nrecovery quality and semantic recovery quality.

    "abstract": "A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surface (STARS) enabled\nintegrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed, where a\nnovel bi-directional sensing-STARS architecture is devised to facilitate the\nfull-space communication and sensing. Based on the proposed framework, a joint\noptimization problem is formulated, where the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for\nestimating the 2-dimension direction-of-arrival of the sensing target is\nminimized. Two cases are considered for sensing performance enhancement. 1) For\nthe two-user case, an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed. In\nparticular, the maximum number of deployable sensors is obtained in the\nclosed-form expressions. 2) For the multi-user case, an extended CRB (ECRB)\nmetric is proposed to characterize the impact of the number of sensors on the\nsensing performance. Based on the proposed metric, a novel penalty-based\ndouble-loop (PDL) algorithm is proposed to solve the ECRB minimization problem.\nTo tackle the coupling of the ECRB, a general decoupling approach is proposed\nto convert it to a tractable weighted linear summation form. Simulation results\nreveal that 1) the proposed PDL algorithm can achieve a near-optimal\nperformance with consideration of sensor deployment; 2) without violating the\ncommunication under the quality of service requirements, reducing the receive\nantennas at the BS does not deteriorate the sensing performance; and 3) it is\npreferable to deploy more passive elements than sensors in terms of achieving\noptimal sensing performance",

    "abstract": "Based on an annotated multimedia corpus, television series Mar{\\=a}y{\\=a}\n2013, we dig into the question of ''automatic standardization'' of Arabic\ndialects for machine translation. Here we distinguish between rule-based\nmachine translation and statistical machine translation. Machine translation\nfrom Arabic most of the time takes standard or modern Arabic as the source\nlanguage and produces quite satisfactory translations thanks to the\navailability of the translation memories necessary for training the models. The\ncase is different for the translation of Arabic dialects. The productions are\nmuch less efficient. In our research we try to apply machine translation\nmethods to a dialect/standard (or modern) Arabic pair to automatically produce\na standard Arabic text from a dialect input, a process we call ''automatic\nstandardization''. we opt here for the application of ''statistical models''\nbecause ''automatic standardization'' based on rules is more hard with the lack\nof ''diglossic'' dictionaries on the one hand and the difficulty of creating\nlinguistic rules for each dialect on the other. Carrying out this research\ncould then lead to combining ''automatic standardization'' software and\nautomatic translation software so that we take the output of the first software\nand introduce it as input into the second one to obtain at the end a quality\nmachine translation. This approach may also have educational applications such\nas the development of applications to help understand different Arabic dialects\nby transforming dialectal texts into standard Arabic.",

Our goal is to bound the ratio between the\ncomputation workload done by all servers over the number of datasets. To this\nend, we here reformulate the real-valued distributed computing problem into a\nmatrix factorization problem and then into a basic sparse recovery problem,\nwhere sparsity implies computational savings.

    "abstract": "Convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers have their own advantages\nand both have been widely used for dense prediction in multi-task learning\n(MTL). Most of the current studies on MTL solely rely on CNN or Transformer. In\nthis work, we present a novel MTL model by combining both merits of deformable\nCNN and query-based Transformer for multi-task learning of dense prediction.\nOur method, named DeMT, is based on a simple and effective encoder-decoder\narchitecture (i.e., deformable mixer encoder and task-aware transformer\ndecoder). First, the deformable mixer encoder contains two types of operators:\nthe channel-aware mixing operator leveraged to allow communication among\ndifferent channels ($i.e.,$ efficient channel location mixing), and the\nspatial-aware deformable operator with deformable convolution applied to\nefficiently sample more informative spatial locations (i.e., deformed\nfeatures). Second, the task-aware transformer decoder consists of the task\ninteraction block and task query block. The former is applied to capture task\ninteraction features via self-attention. The latter leverages the deformed\nfeatures and task-interacted features to generate the corresponding\ntask-specific feature through a query-based Transformer for corresponding task\npredictions. Extensive experiments on two dense image prediction datasets,\nNYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context, demonstrate that our model uses fewer GFLOPs and\nsignificantly outperforms current Transformer- and CNN-based competitive models\non a variety of metrics.

    "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) aims to classify sensory time series into\ndifferent activities, with wide applications in activity tracking, healthcare,\nhuman computer interaction, etc. Existing HAR works improve recognition\nperformance by designing more complicated feature extraction methods, but they\nneglect the label semantics by simply treating labels as integer IDs. We find\nthat many activities in the current HAR datasets have shared label names, e.g.,\n\"open door\" and \"open fridge\", \"walk upstairs\" and \"walk downstairs\". Through\nsome exploratory analysis, we find that such shared structure in activity names\nalso maps to similarity in the input features. To this end, we design a\nsequence-to-sequence framework to decode the label name semantics rather than\nclassifying labels as integer IDs. Our proposed method decomposes learning\nactivities into learning shared tokens (\"open\", \"walk\"), which is easier than\nlearning the joint distribution (\"open fridge\", \"walk upstairs\") and helps\ntransfer learning to activities with insufficient data samples. For datasets\noriginally without shared tokens in label names, we also offer an automated\nmethod, using OpenAI's ChatGPT, to generate shared actions and objects.\nExtensive experiments on seven HAR benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nstate-of-the-art performance of our method.

    "abstract": "Ride-hailing services have skyrocketed in popularity due to the convenience\nthey offer, but recent research has shown that their pricing strategies can\nhave a disparate impact on some riders, such as those living in disadvantaged\nneighborhoods with a greater share of residents of color or residents below the\npoverty line. Since these communities tend to be more dependent on ride-hailing\nservices due to lack of adequate public transportation, it is imperative to\naddress this inequity. To this end, this paper presents the first thorough\nstudy on fair pricing for ride-hailing services by devising applicable fairness\nmeasures and corresponding fair pricing mechanisms. By providing discounts that\nmay be subsidized by the government, our approach results in an increased\nnumber and more affordable rides for the disadvantaged community. Experiments\non real-world Chicago taxi data confirm our theoretical findings which provide\na basis for the government to establish fair ride-hailing policies.",

    "abstract": "As digital resources become diverse in the metaverse, a DNS-like system is\nnecessary for management and resolution. However, the legacy DNS for the TCP/IP\narchitecture was designed with security vulnerabilities and trust risks due to\ncentralized management issues. Although there are several DNS alternatives\nbased on the blockchain, manage only a single type of identifiers or separate\nidentity and other types of identifiers, making it impossible for\nsub-metaverses to coexist and interconnect. This paper proposes the first-ever\nconsortium blockchain System that simultaneously manages Multiple types of\nIdentifiers (MIS) in the metaverse. We opt for a consortium blockchain due to\nits efficiency, enhanced security and manageability properties. MIS is first\nportrayed as a four-tier architecture whereby on-chain data is lightweight and\ncompressed to save on storage while accelerating reading and writing\noperations. The resource data of sub-metaverses exists heterogeneously in the\nstorage tier to alleviate migration. Then we introduce the key functions of the\nmulti-identifiers comprising the registration, resolution, and\ninter-translation. Finally, MIS is implemented on two testbeds and is\naccessible online as an open-source system. The first testbed consists of 4\nphysical servers located in the UK and Malaysia while the second is made up of\n200 virtual machines (VMs) spread over 26 countries across all 5 continents on\nGoogle Cloud. Experiments indicate that MIS provides efficient reading and\nwriting performance that meets the requirements of traditional legacy DNS.

A\nmajor difficulty is the lack of training samples given the small number of true\npositive instances among the increasingly large number of patients being\nscreened. This paper describes a novel methodology that identifies suicidality\nin clinical notes by addressing this data sparsity issue through zero-shot\nlearning. U.S. Veterans Affairs clinical notes served as data. The training\ndataset label was determined using diagnostic codes of suicide attempt and\nself-harm. A base string associated with the target label of suicidality was\nused to provide auxiliary information by narrowing the positive training cases\nto those containing the base string. A deep neural network was trained by\nmapping the training documents contents to a semantic space. For comparison, we\ntrained another deep neural network using the identical training dataset labels\nand bag-of-words features. The zero shot learning model outperformed the\nbaseline model in terms of AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and positive\npredictive value at multiple probability thresholds. In applying a 0.90\nprobability threshold, the methodology identified notes not associated with a\nrelevant ICD 10 CM code that documented suicidality, with 94 percent accuracy.\nThis new method can effectively identify suicidality without requiring manual\nannotation.",

Developers resort to trial-and-error debugging with\nsubsets of clients, hoping to increase the accuracy or let future FL rounds\nretune the model, which are time-consuming and costly.\nWe design a systematic fault localization framework, FedDebug, that advances\nthe FL debugging on two novel fronts. First, FedDebug enables interactive\ndebugging of realtime collaborative training in FL by leveraging record and\nreplay techniques to construct a simulation that mirrors live FL. FedDebug's\n{\\em breakpoint} can help inspect an FL state (round, client, and global model)\nand seamlessly move between rounds and clients' models, enabling a fine-grained\nstep-by-step inspection. Second, FedDebug automatically identifies the client\nresponsible for lowering global model's performance without any testing data\nand labels--both are essential for existing debugging techniques. FedDebug's\nstrengths come from adapting differential testing in conjunction with neurons\nactivations to determine the precise client deviating from normal behavior.\nFedDebug achieves 100\\% to find a single client and 90.3\\% accuracy to find\nmultiple faulty clients. FedDebug's interactive debugging incurs 1.2\\% overhead\nduring training, while it localizes a faulty client in only 2.1\\% of a round's\ntraining time. With FedDebug, we bring effective debugging practices to\nfederated learning, improving the quality and productivity of FL application\ndevelopers.",

    "abstract": "Tertiary education institutions aim to prepare their computer science and\nsoftware engineering students for working life. While much of the technical\nprinciples are covered in lower-level courses, team-based capstone projects are\na common way to provide students with hands-on experience and teach soft\nskills. This paper explores the characteristics of software engineering\ncapstone courses presented in the literature. The goal of this work is to\nunderstand the pros and cons of different approaches by synthesising the\nvarious aspects of software engineering capstone courses and related\nexperiences. In a systematic literature review for 2007-2022, we identified 127\nprimary studies. These studies were analysed based on their presented course\ncharacteristics and the reported course outcomes. The characteristics were\nsynthesised into a taxonomy consisting of duration, team sizes, client and\nproject sources, project implementation, and student assessment. We found out\nthat capstone courses generally last one semester and divide students into\ngroups of 4-5 where they work on a project for a client. For a slight majority\nof courses, the clients are external to the course staff and students are often\nexpected to produce a proof-of-concept level software product as the main end\ndeliverable. The courses also offer versatile assessments for students\nthroughout the project. This paper provides researchers and educators with a\nclassification of characteristics of software engineering capstone courses\nbased on previous research. We further synthesise insights on the reported\noutcomes of capstone courses. Our review study aims to help educators to\nidentify various ways of organising capstones and effectively plan and deliver\ntheir own capstone courses. The characterisation also helps researchers to\nconduct further studies on software engineering capstones.",

An interesting approach is learned discovery\nsystems which find tables given natural language questions. Unfortunately,\nthese systems require a training dataset for each table collection.

In this\npaper, we introduce a self-supervised approach to assemble training datasets\nand train learned discovery systems without human intervention.

Furthermore, purely data-driven methods often neglect\nuseful a priori knowledge, such as approximate models of the system dynamics.\nWe present a method to incorporate such prior knowledge into data-driven\ncontrol algorithms using kernel embeddings, a nonparametric machine learning\ntechnique based in the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.

We experimented with full generic models\n(trained on all data), per-domain generic models (construction, electric T&D,\noil & gas), and with ensembles of generic and specific models. Results are very\npositive, with generic models outperforming the company-specific models in most\ncases while also generating finer-grained, hence more useful, forecasts.\nSuccessful generic models remove the needs for training company-specific\nmodels, saving a lot of time and resources, and give small companies, whose\naccident datasets are too limited to train their own models, access to safety\noutcome predictions. It may still however be advantageous to train specific\nmodels to get an extra boost in performance through ensembling with the generic\nmodels.

Sparse training is one of the\nmost common techniques to reduce these costs, however, the sparsity constraints\nadd difficulty to the optimization, resulting in an increase in training time\nand instability. In this work, we aim to overcome this problem and achieve\nspace-time co-efficiency. To accelerate and stabilize the convergence of sparse\ntraining, we analyze the gradient changes and develop an adaptive gradient\ncorrection method. Specifically, we approximate the correlation between the\ncurrent and previous gradients, which is used to balance the two gradients to\nobtain a corrected gradient. Our method can be used with most popular sparse\ntraining pipelines under both standard and adversarial setups. Theoretically,\nwe prove that our method can accelerate the convergence rate of sparse\ntraining. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, model architectures, and\nsparsities demonstrate that our method outperforms leading sparse training\nmethods by up to \\textbf{5.0\\%} in accuracy given the same number of training\nepochs, and reduces the number of training epochs by up to \\textbf{52.1\\%} to\nachieve the same accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Principal component analysis (PCA) is a workhorse of modern data science.\nPractitioners typically perform PCA assuming the data conforms to Euclidean\ngeometry. However, for specific data types, such as hierarchical data, other\ngeometrical spaces may be more appropriate. We study PCA in space forms; that\nis, those with constant positive (spherical) and negative (hyperbolic)\ncurvatures, in addition to zero-curvature (Euclidean) spaces. At any point on a\nRiemannian manifold, one can define a Riemannian affine subspace based on a set\nof tangent vectors and use invertible maps to project tangent vectors to the\nmanifold and vice versa. Finding a low-dimensional Riemannian affine subspace\nfor a set of points in a space form amounts to dimensionality reduction\nbecause, as we show, any such affine subspace is isometric to a space form of\nthe same dimension and curvature. To find principal components, we seek a\n(Riemannian) affine subspace that best represents a set of manifold-valued data\npoints with the minimum average cost of projecting data points onto the affine\nsubspace. We propose specific cost functions that bring about two major\nbenefits: (1) the affine subspace can be estimated by solving an eigenequation\n-- similar to that of Euclidean PCA, and (2) optimal affine subspaces of\ndifferent dimensions form a nested set. These properties provide advances over\nexisting methods which are mostly iterative algorithms with slow convergence\nand weaker theoretical guarantees. Specifically for hyperbolic PCA, the\nassociated eigenequation operates in the Lorentzian space, endowed with an\nindefinite inner product; we thus establish a connection between Lorentzian and\nEuclidean eigenequations. We evaluate the proposed space form PCA on data sets\nsimulated in spherical and hyperbolic spaces and show that it outperforms\nalternative methods in convergence speed or accuracy, often both.",

We\nprove that the frequency-dependent log-optimal portfolio problem with costs is\nequivalent to a concave program and provide a version of the dominance theorem\nwith costs to determine when an investor should invest all available funds in a\nparticular asset. Then, we show that transaction costs may cause a bankruptcy\nissue for the frequency-dependent log-optimal portfolio. To address this issue,\nwe approximate the problem to obtain a quadratic concave program and derive\nnecessary and sufficient optimality conditions. Additionally, we prove a\nversion of the two-fund theorem, which states that any convex combination of\ntwo optimal weights from the optimality conditions is still optimal. We test\nour proposed methods using both intraday and daily price data. Finally, we\nextend our empirical studies to an online trading scenario by implementing a\nsliding window approach.

    "abstract": "Holographic cloud probes provide unprecedented information on cloud particle\ndensity, size and position. Each laser shot captures particles within a large\nvolume, where images can be computationally refocused to determine particle\nsize and shape. However, processing these holograms, either with standard\nmethods or with machine learning (ML) models, requires considerable\ncomputational resources, time and occasional human intervention. ML models are\ntrained on simulated holograms obtained from the physical model of the probe\nsince real holograms have no absolute truth labels. Using another processing\nmethod to produce labels would be subject to errors that the ML model would\nsubsequently inherit. Models perform well on real holograms only when image\ncorruption is performed on the simulated images during training, thereby\nmimicking non-ideal conditions in the actual probe (Schreck et. al, 2022).\nOptimizing image corruption requires a cumbersome manual labeling effort.\nHere we demonstrate the application of the neural style translation approach\n(Gatys et. al, 2016) to the simulated holograms. With a pre-trained\nconvolutional neural network (VGG-19), the simulated holograms are ``stylized''\nto resemble the real ones obtained from the probe, while at the same time\npreserving the simulated image ``content'' (e.g. the particle locations and\nsizes). Two image similarity metrics concur that the stylized images are more\nlike real holograms than the synthetic ones. With an ML model trained to\npredict particle locations and shapes on the stylized data sets, we observed\ncomparable performance on both simulated and real holograms, obviating the need\nto perform manual labeling. The described approach is not specific to hologram\nimages and could be applied in other domains for capturing noise and\nimperfections in observational instruments to make simulated data more like\nreal world observations.",

It has been implemented\ntheoretically with simulations and experimentally over existing fiber optical\nnetworks since then. QPKE can be considered as an RSA-type scheme in optical\nanalogue domain. QPKE was renamed as Quantum Encryption in Phase Space or QEPS\nto reflect the encryption of coherent states in phase space. QEPS with the\nphase shift gate can only be applied to data modulation scheme with phase shift\nkeying such as quadrature phase shift keying or QPSK. It would leak data\ninformation in amplitude once it is applied to quadrature amplitude modulation\nor QAM schemes. Kuang and Chan recently proposed a new version of QEPS called\nQuantum Encryption in Phase Space with the displacement gate or QEPS-d. It\ndemonstrated to overcome the limitation of QEPS with the phase shift gate. We\nintroduced a reduced displacement operator by ignoring the global phase factor\nthen the reduced displacement operators are commutable. This commutability\nhelps our implementation at both transmission and receiving. An arbitrary\ndisplacement operator can be decoupled into a standard QAM modulation with a\nphase shift modulation to ease our encryption and decryption. This paper\nsimulates the QEPS-d encryption for QPSK data modulation to demonstrate how\nQEPS-d works.",

Most of the conventional optimization and deep\nlearning techniques explore local information for reconstruction. Recently,\nnonlocal low-rank (NLR) reconstruction has achieved remarkable success in\nimproving accuracy and generalization. However, the computational cost has\ninhibited NLR from seeking global structural similarity, which consequentially\nkeeps it trapped in the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency and prevents\nit from high-dimensional large-scale tasks. To address this challenge, we\nreport here the global low-rank (GLR) optimization technique, realizing\nhighly-efficient large-scale reconstruction with global self-similarity.\nInspired by the self-attention mechanism in deep learning, GLR extracts\nexemplar image patches by feature detection instead of conventional uniform\nselection. This directly produces key patches using structural features to\navoid burdensome computational redundancy. Further, it performs patch matching\nacross the entire image via neural-based convolution, which produces the global\nsimilarity heat map in parallel, rather than conventional sequential block-wise\nmatching. As such, GLR improves patch grouping efficiency by more than one\norder of magnitude. We experimentally demonstrate GLR's effectiveness on\ntemporal, frequency, and spectral dimensions, including different computational\nimaging modalities of compressive temporal imaging, magnetic resonance imaging,\nand multispectral filter array demosaicing.

    "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this study is to develop a deep-learning based\ndetection and diagnosis technique for carotid atherosclerosis using a portable\nfreehand 3D ultrasound (US) imaging system. Methods: A total of 127 3D carotid\nartery datasets were acquired using a portable 3D US imaging system. A U-Net\nsegmentation network was firstly applied to extract the carotid artery on 2D\ntransverse frame, then a novel 3D reconstruction algorithm using fast dot\nprojection (FDP) method with position regularization was proposed to\nreconstruct the carotid artery volume. Furthermore, a convolutional neural\nnetwork was used to classify the healthy case and diseased case qualitatively.\n3D volume analysis including longitudinal reprojection algorithm and stenosis\ngrade measurement algorithm was developed to obtain the clinical metrics\nquantitatively. Results: The proposed system achieved sensitivity of 0.714,\nspecificity of 0.851 and accuracy of 0.803 respectively in diagnosis of carotid\natherosclerosis. The automatically measured stenosis grade illustrated good\ncorrelation (r=0.762) with the experienced expert measurement. Conclusion: the\ndeveloped technique based on 3D US imaging can be applied to the automatic\ndiagnosis of carotid atherosclerosis. Significance: The proposed deep-learning\nbased technique was specially designed for a portable 3D freehand US system,\nwhich can provide carotid atherosclerosis examination more conveniently and\ndecrease the dependence on clinician's experience.",

    "abstract": "Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) has been widely adapted due to its\nsample efficiency. However, existing worst-case regret analysis typically\nrequires optimistic planning, which is not realistic in general. In contrast,\nmotivated by the theory, empirical study utilizes ensemble of models, which\nachieve state-of-the-art performance on various testing environments. Such\ndeviation between theory and empirical study leads us to question whether\nrandomized model ensemble guarantee optimism, and hence the optimal worst-case\nregret? This paper partially answers such question from the perspective of\nreward randomization, a scarcely explored direction of exploration with MBRL.\nWe show that under the kernelized linear regulator (KNR) model, reward\nrandomization guarantees a partial optimism, which further yields a\nnear-optimal worst-case regret in terms of the number of interactions. We\nfurther extend our theory to generalized function approximation and identified\nconditions for reward randomization to attain provably efficient exploration.\nCorrespondingly, we propose concrete examples of efficient reward\nrandomization.

However, metastatic LNs are\ntime-consuming and challenging to detect even for professional radiologists due\nto their small sizes, high sparsity, and ambiguity in appearance. It is desired\nto leverage recent development in deep learning to automatically detect\nmetastatic LNs. Besides a two-stage detection network, we here introduce an\nadditional branch to leverage information about LN stations, an important\nreference for radiologists during metastatic LN diagnosis, as supplementary\ninformation for metastatic LN detection. The branch targets to solve a closely\nrelated task on the LN station level, i.e., classifying whether an LN station\ncontains metastatic LN or not, so as to learn representations for LN stations.\nConsidering that a metastatic LN station is expected to significantly affect\nthe nearby ones, a GCN-based structure is adopted by the branch to model the\nrelationship among different LN stations. At the classification stage of\nmetastatic LN detection, the above learned LN station features, as well as the\nfeatures reflecting the distance between the LN candidate and the LN stations,\nare integrated with the LN features.

    "abstract": "The joint hyperspectral image (HSI) and LiDAR data classification aims to\ninterpret ground objects at more detailed and precise level. Although deep\nlearning methods have shown remarkable success in the multisource data\nclassification task, self-supervised learning has rarely been explored. It is\ncommonly nontrivial to build a robust self-supervised learning model for\nmultisource data classification, due to the fact that the semantic similarities\nof neighborhood regions are not exploited in existing contrastive learning\nframework. Furthermore, the heterogeneous gap induced by the inconsistent\ndistribution of multisource data impedes the classification performance. To\novercome these disadvantages, we propose a Nearest Neighbor-based Contrastive\nLearning Network (NNCNet), which takes full advantage of large amounts of\nunlabeled data to learn discriminative feature representations. Specifically,\nwe propose a nearest neighbor-based data augmentation scheme to use enhanced\nsemantic relationships among nearby regions. The intermodal semantic alignments\ncan be captured more accurately. In addition, we design a bilinear attention\nmodule to exploit the second-order and even high-order feature interactions\nbetween the HSI and LiDAR data. Extensive experiments on four public datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of our NNCNet over state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "As an essential measure to combat global warming, electric vehicles (EVs)\nhave witnessed rapid growth. Meanwhile, thanks to the flexibility of EV\ncharging, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) interaction has captured great attention.\nHowever, the direct control of individual EVs is challenging due to their small\ncapacity, large number, and private information. Hence, it is the aggregator\nthat interacts with the grid on behalf of EVs by characterizing their aggregate\nflexibility. In this paper, we focus on the aggregate EV power flexibility\ncharacterization problem. First, an offline model is built to obtain the lower\nand upper bounds of the aggregate power flexibility region. It ensures that any\ntrajectory within the region is feasible. Then, considering that parameters\nsuch as real-time electricity prices and EV arrival/departure times are not\nknown in advance, an online algorithm is developed based on Lyapunov\noptimization techniques. We prove that the charging time delays for EVs always\nmeet the requirement even if they are not considered explicitly. Furthermore,\nreal-time feedback is designed and integrated into the proposed online\nalgorithm to better unlock EV power flexibility. Comprehensive performance\ncomparisons are carried out to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed\nmethod.",

    "abstract": "Upward lightning (UL) has become an increasingly important threat to wind\nturbines as ever more of them are being installed for renewably producing\nelectricity. The taller the wind turbine the higher the risk that the type of\nlightning striking the man-made structure is UL. UL can be much more\ndestructive than downward lightning due to its long lasting initial continuous\ncurrent leading to a large charge transfer within the lightning discharge\nprocess. Current standards for the risk assessment of lightning at wind\nturbines mainly take the summer lightning activity into account, which is\ninferred from LLS. Ground truth lightning current measurements reveal that less\nthan 50% of UL might be detected by lightning location systems (LLS). This\nleads to a large underestimation of the proportion of LLS-non-detectable UL at\nwind turbines, which is the dominant lightning type in the cold season. This\nstudy aims to assess the risk of LLS-detectable and LLS-non-detectable UL at\nwind turbines using direct UL measurements at the Gaisberg Tower (Austria) and\nS\\\"antis Tower (Switzerland). Direct UL observations are linked to\nmeteorological reanalysis data and joined by random forests, a powerful machine\nlearning technique. The meteorological drivers for the non-/occurrence of\nLLS-detectable and LLS-non-detectable UL, respectively, are found from the\nrandom forest models trained at the towers and have large predictive skill on\nindependent data. In a second step the results from the tower-trained models\nare extended to a larger study domain (Central and Northern Germany). The\ntower-trained models for LLS-detectable lightning is independently verified at\nwind turbine locations in that domain and found to reliably diagnose that type\nof UL. Risk maps based on case study events show that high diagnosed\nprobabilities in the study domain coincide with actual UL events.",

    "abstract": "Image denoising (removal of additive white Gaussian noise from an image) is\none of the oldest and most studied problems in image processing. An extensive\nwork over several decades has led to thousands of papers on this subject, and\nto many well-performing algorithms for this task. Indeed, 10 years ago, these\nachievements have led some researchers to suspect that \"Denoising is Dead\", in\nthe sense that all that can be achieved in this domain has already been\nobtained. However, this turned out to be far from the truth, with the\npenetration of deep learning (DL) into image processing. The era of DL brought\na revolution to image denoising, both by taking the lead in today's ability for\nnoise removal in images, and by broadening the scope of denoising problems\nbeing treated. Our paper starts by describing this evolution, highlighting in\nparticular the tension and synergy that exist between classical approaches and\nmodern DL-based alternatives in design of image denoisers.\nThe recent transitions in the field of image denoising go far beyond the\nability to design better denoisers. In the 2nd part of this paper we focus on\nrecently discovered abilities and prospects of image denoisers. We expose the\npossibility of using denoisers to serve other problems, such as regularizing\ngeneral inverse problems and serving as the prime engine in diffusion-based\nimage synthesis. We also unveil the idea that denoising and other inverse\nproblems might not have a unique solution as common algorithms would have us\nbelieve. Instead, we describe constructive ways to produce randomized and\ndiverse high quality results for inverse problems, all fueled by the progress\nthat DL brought to image denoising.\nThis survey paper aims to provide a broad view of the history of image\ndenoising and closely related topics. Our aim is to give a better context to\nrecent discoveries, and to the influence of DL in our domain.",

Conventional electronic structure\nprediction methods based on density functional theory (DFT) suffer from not\nonly high computational cost, but also limited accuracy arising from the\napproximations of the exchange-correlation functional. Surrogate methods based\non machine learning have garnered much attention as a viable alternative to\nbypass these limitations, especially in the prediction of solid-state band\ngaps, which motivated this research study.

Among the 20 physical features\nemployed, we find that the bulk modulus, superconductivity temperature, and\ncation electronegativity exhibit the highest importance scores, consistent with\nthe physics of the underlying electronic structure. Using the top 10 features,\na model accuracy of 85.6% with a root mean square error of 0.64 eV is obtained,\ncomparable to previous studies.

To enable their use in the 5G network, it requires that the\ntransmission energy be focused in sharp pencil beams. As any misalignment\nbetween the transmitter and receiver beam pair can reduce the data rate\nsignificantly, it is important that they are aligned as much as possible. To\nfind the best transmit-receive beam pair, recent beam alignment (BA) techniques\nexamine the entire beam space, which might result in a large amount of BA\nlatency. Recent works propose to adaptively select the beams such that the\ncumulative reward measured in terms of received signal strength or throughput\nis maximized. In this paper, we develop an algorithm that exploits the unimodal\nstructure of the received signal strengths of the beams to identify the best\nbeam in a finite time using pure exploration strategies. Strategies that\nidentify the best beam in a fixed time slot are more suitable for wireless\nnetwork protocol design than cumulative reward maximization strategies that\ncontinuously perform exploration and exploitation. Our algorithm is named\nUnimodal Bandit for Best Beam (UB3) and identifies the best beam with a high\nprobability in a few rounds. We prove that the error exponent in the\nprobability does not depend on the number of beams and show that this is indeed\nthe case by establishing a lower bound for the unimodal bandits.

However, the installation of multiple\nsensors to monitor each appliance currently has a high initial cost and as a\nresult, monitoring consumption from different appliances using sensors is not\ncost-effective. To address this challenge, studies have focused on analyzing\nmeasurements of the total domestic consumption using Machine Learning (ML)\nmethods, to disaggregate water usage into each appliance. Identifying which\nappliances are in use through ML is challenging since their operation may be\noverlapping, while specific appliances may operate with intermittent flow,\nmaking individual consumption events hard to distinguish. Moreover, ML\napproaches require large amounts of labeled input data to train their models,\nwhich are typically not available for a single household, while usage\ncharacteristics may vary in different regions. In this work, we initially\npropose a data model that generates synthetic time series based on regional\nwater usage characteristics and resolution to overcome the need for a large\ntraining dataset with real labeled data. The method requires a small number of\nreal labeled data from the studied region. Following this, we propose a new\nalgorithm for classifying single and overlapping household water usage events,\nusing the total domestic consumption measurements.",

    "abstract": "In this manuscript, we propose a novel deep learning (DL)-based framework\nintended for obtaining short latency in real-time electroencephalogram-based\nepileptic seizure detection using multiscale 3D convolutional neural networks.\nWe pioneer converting seizure detection task from traditional binary\nclassification of samples from ictal and interictal periods to probabilistic\nclassification of samples from interictal, ictal, and crossing periods. We\nintroduce a crossing period from seizure-oriented EEG recording and propose a\nlabelling rule using soft-label for samples from the crossing period to build a\nprobabilistic classification task. A novel multiscale short-time Fourier\ntransform feature extraction method and 3D convolution neural network\narchitecture are proposed to accurately capture predictive probabilities of\nsamples. Furthermore, we also propose rectified weighting strategy to enhance\npredictive probabilities, and accumulative decision-making rule to achieve\nshort detection latency. We implement leave-one-seizure-out cross validation on\ntwo prevalent datasets -- CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset and SWEC-ETHZ intracranial\nEEG dataset. Eventually, the proposed algorithm achieved 94 out of 99 seizures\ndetected during the crossing period, averaged 14.84% rectified predictive ictal\nprobability (RPIP) errors of crossing samples, 2.3 s detection latency, 0.32/h\nfalse detection rate on CHB-MIT dataset, meanwhile 84 out of 89 detected\nseizures, 16.17% RPIP errors, 4.7 s detection latency, and 0.75/h FDR are\nachieved on SWEC-ETHZ dataset. The obtained detection latencies are at least\n50% faster than state-of-the-art results reported in previous studies.",

    "abstract": "The recent emergence of 6G raises the challenge of increasing the\ntransmission data rate even further in order to overcome the Shannon limit.\nTraditional communication methods fall short of the 6G goals, paving the way\nfor Semantic Communication (SemCom) systems that have applications in the\nmetaverse, healthcare, economics, etc. In SemCom systems, only the relevant\nkeywords from the data are extracted and used for transmission. In this paper,\nwe design an auto-encoder and auto-decoder that only transmit these keywords\nand, respectively, recover the data using the received keywords and the shared\nknowledge. This SemCom system is used in a setup in which the receiver\nallocates various categories of the same dataset collected from the\ntransmitter, which differ in size and accuracy, to a number of users. This\nscenario is formulated using an optimization problem called the data allocation\nproblem (DAP). We show that it is NP-complete and propose a greedy algorithm to\nsolve it. Using simulations, we show that the proposed methods for SemCom\nsystem design outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of average number of\nwords per sentence for a given accuracy, and that the proposed greedy algorithm\nsolution of the DAP performs significantly close to the optimal solution.",

    "abstract": "Sleep behaviour and in-bed movements contain rich information on the\nneurophysiological health of people, and have a direct link to the general\nwell-being and quality of life. Standard clinical practices rely on\npolysomnography for sleep assessment; however, it is intrusive, performed in\nunfamiliar environments and requires trained personnel. Progress has been made\non less invasive sensor technologies, such as actigraphy, but clinical\nvalidation raises concerns over their reliability and precision. Additionally,\nthe field lacks a widely acceptable algorithm, with proposed approaches ranging\nfrom raw signal or feature thresholding to data-hungry classification models,\nmany of which are unfamiliar to medical staff. This paper proposes an online\nBayesian probabilistic framework for objective (in)activity detection and\nsegmentation based on clinically meaningful joint kinematics, measured by a\ncustom-made wearable sensor. Intuitive three-dimensional visualisations of\nkinematic timeseries were accomplished through dimension reduction based\npreprocessing, offering out-of-the-box framework explainability potentially\nuseful for clinical monitoring and diagnosis. The proposed framework attained\nup to 99.2\\% $F_1$-score and 0.96 Pearson's correlation coefficient in,\nrespectively, the posture change detection and inactivity segmentation tasks.\nThe work paves the way for a reliable home-based analysis of movements during\nsleep which would serve patient-centred longitudinal care plans.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, typically observed\nvia seizure episodes. Epileptic seizures are commonly monitored through\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) recordings due to their routine and low expense\ncollection. The stochastic nature of EEG makes seizure identification via\nmanual inspections performed by highly-trained experts a tedious endeavor,\nmotivating the use of automated identification. The literature on automated\nidentification focuses mostly on supervised learning methods requiring expert\nlabels of EEG segments that contain seizures, which are difficult to obtain.\nMotivated by these observations, we pose seizure identification as an\nunsupervised anomaly detection problem. To this end, we employ the first\nunsupervised transformer-based model for seizure identification on raw EEG. We\ntrain an autoencoder involving a transformer encoder via an unsupervised loss\nfunction, incorporating a novel masking strategy uniquely designed for\nmultivariate time-series data such as EEG. Training employs EEG recordings that\ndo not contain any seizures, while seizures are identified with respect to\nreconstruction errors at inference time. We evaluate our method on three\npublicly available benchmark EEG datasets for distinguishing seizure vs.\nnon-seizure windows. Our method leads to significantly better seizure\nidentification performance than supervised learning counterparts, by up to 16%\nrecall, 9% accuracy, and 9% Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics\nCurve (AUC), establishing particular benefits on highly imbalanced data.\nThrough accurate seizure identification, our method could facilitate widely\naccessible and early detection of epilepsy development, without needing\nexpensive label collection or manual feature extraction.",
