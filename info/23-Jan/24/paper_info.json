    "abstract": "Enactive Artificial Intelligence (eAI) motivates new directions towards\ngender-inclusive AI. Beyond a mirror reflecting our values, AI design has a\nprofound impact on shaping the enaction of cultural identities. The\ntraditionally unrepresentative, white, cisgender, heterosexual dominant\nnarratives are partial, and thereby active vehicles of social marginalisation.\nDrawing from enactivism, the paper first characterises AI design as a cultural\npractice; which is then specified in feminist technoscience principles, i.e.\nhow gender and other embodied identity markers are entangled in AI. These\nprinciples are then discussed in the specific case of feminist human-robot\ninteraction. The paper, then, stipulates the conditions for eAI: an eAI robot\nis a robot that (1) plays a cultural role in individual and social identity,\n(2) this role takes the form of human-robot dynamical interaction, and (3)\ninteraction is embodied. Drawing from eAI, finally, the paper offers guidelines\nfor I. eAI gender-inclusive AI, and II. subverting existing gender norms of\nrobot design.",

We adopt the prompts advised by ChatGPT to trigger its\ntranslation ability and find that the candidate prompts generally work well and\nshow minor performance differences. By evaluating on a number of benchmark test\nsets, we find that ChatGPT performs competitively with commercial translation\nproducts (e.g., Google Translate) on high-resource European languages but lags\nbehind significantly on lowresource or distant languages. As for the\ntranslation robustness, ChatGPT does not perform as well as the commercial\nsystems on biomedical abstracts or Reddit comments but is potentially a good\ntranslator for spoken language.

    "abstract": "While the capabilities of generative models heavily improved in different\ndomains (images, text, graphs, molecules, etc.), their evaluation metrics\nlargely remain based on simplified quantities or manual inspection with limited\npracticality. To this end, we propose a framework for Multi-level Performance\nEvaluation of Generative mOdels (MPEGO), which could be employed across\ndifferent domains. MPEGO aims to quantify generation performance\nhierarchically, starting from a sub-feature-based low-level evaluation to a\nglobal features-based high-level evaluation. MPEGO offers great customizability\nas the employed features are entirely user-driven and can thus be highly\ndomain/problem-specific while being arbitrarily complex (e.g., outcomes of\nexperimental procedures). We validate MPEGO using multiple generative models\nacross several datasets from the material discovery domain. An ablation study\nis conducted to study the plausibility of intermediate steps in MPEGO. Results\ndemonstrate that MPEGO provides a flexible, user-driven, and multi-level\nevaluation framework, with practical insights on the generation quality.

    "abstract": "Recent studies on backdoor attacks in model training have shown that\npolluting a small portion of training data is sufficient to produce incorrect\nmanipulated predictions on poisoned test-time data while maintaining high clean\naccuracy in downstream tasks. The stealthiness of backdoor attacks has imposed\ntremendous defense challenges in today's machine learning paradigm. In this\npaper, we explore the potential of self-training via additional unlabeled data\nfor mitigating backdoor attacks. We begin by making a pilot study to show that\nvanilla self-training is not effective in backdoor mitigation. Spurred by that,\nwe propose to defend the backdoor attacks by leveraging strong but proper data\naugmentations in the self-training pseudo-labeling stage. We find that the new\nself-training regime help in defending against backdoor attacks to a great\nextent. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments for different\nbackdoor triggers on CIFAR-10 and a combination of CIFAR-10 with an additional\nunlabeled 500K TinyImages dataset. Finally, we explore the direction of\ncombining self-supervised representation learning with self-training for\nfurther improvement in backdoor defense.",

    "abstract": "Developing models to automatically score students' written responses to\nscience problems is critical for science education. However, collecting and\nlabeling sufficient student responses for training models is time and\ncost-consuming. Recent studies suggest that pre-trained language models (PLMs)\ncan be adapted to downstream tasks without fine-tuning with prompts. However,\nno research has employed such a prompt approach in science education. As\nstudent responses are presented with natural language, aligning the scoring\nprocedure as the next sentence prediction task using prompts can skip the\ncostly fine-tuning stage. In this study, we developed a zero-shot approach to\nautomatically score student responses via Matching Exemplars as Next Sentence\nPrediction (MeNSP). This approach employs no training samples. We first apply\nMeNSP in scoring three assessment tasks of scientific argumentation and found\nmachine-human scoring agreements, Cohen's Kappa ranges from 0.30 to 0.57, and\nF1 score ranges from 0.54 to 0.81. To improve the performance, we extend our\nresearch to the few-shots setting, either randomly selecting labeled student\nresponses or manually constructing responses to fine-tune the models. We find\nthat one task's performance is improved with more samples, Cohen's Kappa from\n0.30 to 0.38, and F1 score from 0.54 to 0.59; for the two others, scoring\nperformance is not improved. We also find that randomly selected few-shots\nperform better than the human expert-crafted approach. This study suggests that\nMeNSP can yield referable automatic scoring for student responses while\nsignificantly reducing the cost of model training. This method can benefit\nlow-stakes classroom assessment practices in science education. Future research\nshould further explore the applicability of the MeNSP in different types of\nassessment tasks in science education and improve the model performance.",

    "abstract": "Given the development and abundance of social media, studying the stance of\nsocial media users is a challenging and pressing issue. Social media users\nexpress their stance by posting tweets and retweeting. Therefore, the\nhomogeneous relationship between users and the heterogeneous relationship\nbetween users and tweets are relevant for the stance detection task. Recently,\ngraph neural networks (GNNs) have developed rapidly and have been applied to\nsocial media research. In this paper, we crawl a large-scale dataset of the\n2020 US presidential election and automatically label all users by manually\ntagged hashtags. Subsequently, we propose a bipartite graph neural network\nmodel, DoubleH, which aims to better utilize homogeneous and heterogeneous\ninformation in user stance detection tasks. Specifically, we first construct a\nbipartite graph based on posting and retweeting relations for two kinds of\nnodes, including users and tweets. We then iteratively update the node's\nrepresentation by extracting and separately processing heterogeneous and\nhomogeneous information in the node's neighbors. Finally, the representations\nof user nodes are used for user stance classification. Experimental results\nshow that DoubleH outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on popular\nbenchmarks. Further analysis illustrates the model's utilization of information\nand demonstrates stability and efficiency at different numbers of layers.",

    "abstract": "Split Learning (SL) is a new collaborative learning technique that allows\nparticipants, e.g. a client and a server, to train machine learning models\nwithout the client sharing raw data. In this setting, the client initially\napplies its part of the machine learning model on the raw data to generate\nactivation maps and then sends them to the server to continue the training\nprocess. Previous works in the field demonstrated that reconstructing\nactivation maps could result in privacy leakage of client data. In addition to\nthat, existing mitigation techniques that overcome the privacy leakage of SL\nprove to be significantly worse in terms of accuracy. In this paper, we improve\nupon previous works by constructing a protocol based on U-shaped SL that can\noperate on homomorphically encrypted data. More precisely, in our approach, the\nclient applies Homomorphic Encryption (HE) on the activation maps before\nsending them to the server, thus protecting user privacy. This is an important\nimprovement that reduces privacy leakage in comparison to other SL-based works.\nFinally, our results show that, with the optimum set of parameters, training\nwith HE data in the U-shaped SL setting only reduces accuracy by 2.65% compared\nto training on plaintext. In addition, raw training data privacy is preserved.",

    "abstract": "Semi-autonomous (SA) systems face the problem of deciding whether to select\ncontrol input from the human operator or autonomous controller when they\nconflict with each other. While one may design an SA system to default to\naccepting control from one or the other, such design choices can have\ncatastrophic consequences in safety-critical settings. For instance, the\nsensors an autonomous controller relies upon may provide incorrect information\nabout the environment due to tampering or natural wear. On the other hand, the\nhuman operator may also provide dangerous input. This begs an important\nquestion: Can we convert an existing SA system to make dynamic real-time\ncontrol decisions that are tolerant of erroneous/malicious input?\nTo explore this question in this paper, we investigate a specific application\nof an SA system that failed due to a static assignment of control authority.\nNamely, the well-publicized failure of the Boeing 737-MAX Maneuvering\nCharacteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) that caused the crashes of Lion Air\nFlight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. First, through in-depth real-time\nsimulation, we analyze and demonstrate the ease by which the original MCAS\ndesign could fail. Our analysis reveals several novel vectors of failure that\nwere not present in the original crashes. We also analyze Boeing's revised MCAS\nand show how it falls short of its intended goals. Using these insights, we\npresent Semi-Autonomous MCAS (SA-MCAS), a new MCAS that both meets the intended\ngoals of MCAS and avoids the failure cases that plagued the original MCAS\ndesign. We demonstrate SA-MCAS's ability to make correct control decisions of\nthe aircraft, even when the human and autonomous operators provide conflicting\ncontrol inputs.",

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic \"event\" cameras, designed to mimic the human vision system with\nasynchronous sensing, unlock a new realm of high-speed and high dynamic range\napplications. However, researchers often either revert to a framed\nrepresentation of event data for applications, or build bespoke applications\nfor a particular camera's event data type. To usher in the next era of video\nsystems, accommodate new event camera designs, and explore the benefits to\nasynchronous video in classical applications, we argue that there is a need for\nan asynchronous, source-agnostic video representation. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel, asynchronous intensity representation for both framed and\nnon-framed data sources. We show that our representation can increase intensity\nprecision and greatly reduce the number of samples per pixel compared to\ngrid-based representations. With framed sources, we demonstrate that by\npermitting a small amount of loss through the temporal averaging of similar\npixel values, we can reduce our representational sample rate by more than half,\nwhile incurring a drop in VMAF quality score of only 4.5. We also demonstrate\nlower latency than the state-of-the-art method for fusing and transcoding\nframed and event camera data to an intensity representation, while maintaining\n$2000\\times$ the temporal resolution.

Mobile users' trajectories prediction\nbelongs to the task of temporal information processing and it is a mobility\nmanagement problem that is essential for self-organizing and autonomous 6G\nnetworks. Our aim is to accurately predict the future positions of mobile users\nin wireless networks using QRC. To do so, we use a real-world time series\ndataset to model mobile users' trajectories. The QRC approach has two\ncomponents: reservoir computing (RC) and quantum computing (QC). In RC, the\ntraining is more computational-efficient than the training of simple recurrent\nneural networks (RNN) since, in RC, only the weights of the output layer are\ntrainable. The internal part of RC is what is called the reservoir. For the RC\nto perform well, the weights of the reservoir should be chosen carefully to\ncreate highly complex and nonlinear dynamics. The QC is used to create such\ndynamical reservoir that maps the input time series into higher dimensional\ncomputational space composed of dynamical states. After obtaining the\nhigh-dimensional dynamical states, a simple linear regression is performed to\ntrain the output weights and thus the prediction of the mobile users'\ntrajectories can be performed efficiently. In this paper, we apply a QRC\napproach based on the Hamiltonian time evolution of a quantum system. We\nsimulate the time evolution using IBM gate-based quantum computers and we show\nin the experimental results that the use of QRC to predict the mobile users'\ntrajectories with only a few qubits is efficient and is able to outperform the\nclassical approaches such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) approach and the\necho-state networks (ESN) approach.",

    "title": "In-situ Water quality monitoring in Oil and Gas operations",
    "abstract": "From agriculture to mining, to energy, surface water quality monitoring is an\nessential task. As oil and gas operators work to reduce the consumption of\nfreshwater, it is increasingly important to actively manage fresh and non-fresh\nwater resources over the long term. For large-scale monitoring, manual sampling\nat many sites has become too time-consuming and unsustainable, given the sheer\nnumber of dispersed ponds, small lakes, playas, and wetlands over a large area.\nTherefore, satellite-based environmental monitoring presents great potential.\nMany existing satellite-based monitoring studies utilize index-based methods to\nmonitor large water bodies such as rivers and oceans. However, these existing\nmethods fail when monitoring small ponds-the reflectance signal received from\nsmall water bodies is too weak to detect. To address this challenge, we propose\na new Water Quality Enhanced Index (WQEI) Model, which is designed to enable\nusers to determine contamination levels in water bodies with weak reflectance\npatterns. Our results show that 1) WQEI is a good indicator of water turbidity\nvalidated with 1200 water samples measured in the laboratory, and 2) by\napplying our method to commonly available satellite data (e.g. LandSat8), one\ncan achieve high accuracy water quality monitoring efficiently in large\nregions. This provides a tool for operators to optimize the quality of water\nstored within surface storage ponds and increasing the readiness and\navailability of non-fresh water.",

CVC insertion may cause serious\ncomplications like misplacement into an artery or perforation of cervical\nvessels. Placing a CVC under sonographic guidance is an appropriate method to\nreduce such adverse events, if anatomical landmarks like venous and arterial\nvessels can be detected reliably. This task shall be solved by registration of\npatient individual images vs. an anatomically labelled reference image. In this\nwork, a linear, affine transformation is performed on cervical sonograms,\nfollowed by a non-linear transformation to achieve a more precise registration.\nVoxelmorph (VM), a learning-based library for deformable image registration\nusing a convolutional neural network (CNN) with U-Net structure was used for\nnon-linear transformation. The impact of principal component analysis\n(PCA)-based pre-denoising of patient individual images, as well as the impact\nof modified net structures with differing complexities on registration results\nwere examined visually and quantitatively, the latter using metrics for\ndeformation and image similarity. Using the PCA-approximated cervical sonograms\nresulted in decreased mean deformation lengths between 18% and 66% compared to\ntheir original image counterparts, depending on net structure. In addition,\nreducing the number of convolutional layers led to improved image similarity\nwith PCA images, while worsening in original images.

    "abstract": "Ethereum is a permissionless blockchain ecosystem that supports execution of\nsmart contracts, the key enablers of decentralized finance (DeFi) and\nnon-fungible tokens (NFT). However, the expressiveness of Ethereum smart\ncontracts is a double-edged sword: while it enables blockchain programmability,\nit also introduces security vulnerabilities, i.e., the exploitable\ndiscrepancies between expected and actual behaviors of the contract code. To\naddress these discrepancies and increase the vulnerability coverage, we propose\na new smart contract security testing approach called transaction\nencapsulation. The core idea lies in the local execution of transactions on a\nfully-synchronized yet isolated Ethereum node, which creates a preview of\noutcomes of transaction sequences on the current state of blockchain. This\napproach poses a critical technical challenge -- the well-known\ntime-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) problem, i.e., the assurance that the final\ntransactions will exhibit the same execution paths as the encapsulated test\ntransactions. In this work, we determine the exact conditions for guaranteed\nexecution path replicability of the tested transactions, and implement a\ntransaction testing tool, TxT, which reveals the actual outcomes of Ethereum\ntransactions. To ensure the correctness of testing, TxT deterministically\nverifies whether a given sequence of transactions ensues an identical execution\npath on the current state of blockchain. We analyze over 1.3 billion Ethereum\ntransactions and determine that 96.5% of them can be verified by TxT. We\nfurther show that TxT successfully reveals the suspicious behaviors associated\nwith 31 out of 37 vulnerabilities (83.8% coverage) in the smart contract\nweakness classification (SWC) registry. In comparison, the vulnerability\ncoverage of all the existing defense approaches combined only reaches 40.5%.",

We report results\nfrom a survey of 122 workers on a leading online labor platform (Upwork) to\nexamine crowd workers' behavioral preferences for collaboration and explore\nseveral antecedents of cooperative behaviors. We then test if actual\ncooperative behavior matches with workers' behavioral preferences through an\nincentivized social dilemma experiment.

We contribute to a\nbetter understanding of the potential for collaborative work in crowdsourcing\nby accessing if and what social factors and collective culture exist among\ncrowd workers. We discuss the implications of our results for platform\ndesigners by highlighting the importance of platform features that promote\nshared expectations and improve accountability.

    "abstract": "We present a novel staggered semi-implicit hybrid FV/FE method for the\nnumerical solution of the shallow water equations at all Froude numbers on\nunstructured meshes. A semi-discretization in time of the conservative\nSaint-Venant equations with bottom friction terms leads to its decomposition\ninto a first order hyperbolic subsystem containing the nonlinear convective\nterm and a second order wave equation for the pressure. For the spatial\ndiscretization of the free surface elevation an unstructured mesh of triangular\nsimplex elements is considered, whereas a dual grid of the edge-type is\nemployed for the computation of the depth-averaged momentum vector. The first\nstage of the proposed algorithm consists in the solution of the nonlinear\nconvective subsystem using an explicit Godunov-type FV method on the staggered\ngrid. Next, a classical continuous FE scheme provides the free surface\nelevation at the vertex of the primal mesh. The semi-implicit strategy followed\ncircumvents the contribution of the surface wave celerity to the CFL-type time\nstep restriction making the proposed algorithm well-suited for low Froude\nnumber flows. The conservative formulation of the governing equations also\nallows the discretization of high Froude number flows with shock waves. As\nsuch, the new hybrid FV/FE scheme is able to deal simultaneously with both,\nsubcritical as well as supercritical flows. Besides, the algorithm is well\nbalanced by construction. The accuracy of the overall methodology is studied\nnumerically and the C-property is proven theoretically and validated via\nnumerical experiments. The solution of several Riemann problems attests the\nrobustness of the new method to deal also with flows containing bores and\ndiscontinuities. Finally, a 3D dam break problem over a dry bottom is studied\nand our numerical results are successfully compared with numerical reference\nsolutions and experimental data.",

    "title": "Same Words, Different Meanings: Interpretable Predictions of  Polarization Trends in Broadcast Media Language and Granger Causal Effects on  Public Discourse",
    "abstract": "With the growth of online news over the past decade, empirical studies on\npolitical discourse and news consumption have focused on the phenomenon of\nfilter bubbles and echo chambers. Yet recently, scholars have revealed limited\nevidence around the impact of such phenomenon, leading some to argue that\npartisan segregation across news audiences cannot be fully explained by online\nnews consumption alone and that the role of traditional legacy media may be as\nsalient in polarizing public discourse around current events. In this work, we\nexpand the scope of analysis to include both online and more traditional media\nby investigating the relationship between broadcast news media language and\nsocial media discourse. By analyzing a decade's worth of closed captions (2\nmillion speaker turns) from CNN and Fox News along with topically corresponding\ndiscourse from Twitter, we provide a novel framework for measuring semantic\npolarization between America's two major broadcast networks to demonstrate how\nsemantic polarization between these outlets has evolved (Study 1), peaked\n(Study 2) and influenced partisan discussions on Twitter (Study 3) across the\nlast decade. Our results demonstrate a sharp increase in polarization in how\ntopically important keywords are discussed between the two channels, especially\nafter 2016, with overall highest peaks occurring in 2020. The two stations\ndiscuss identical topics in drastically distinct contexts in 2020, to the\nextent that there is barely any linguistic overlap in how identical keywords\nare contextually discussed. Further, we demonstrate at scale, how such partisan\ndivision in broadcast media language significantly shapes semantic polarity\ntrends on Twitter (and vice-versa), empirically linking for the first time, how\nonline discussions are influenced by televised media.",

    "abstract": "Accurately modeling complex, multimodal distributions is necessary for\noptimal decision-making, but doing so for rotations in three-dimensions, i.e.,\nthe SO(3) group, is challenging due to the curvature of the rotation manifold.\nThe recently described implicit-PDF (IPDF) is a simple, elegant, and effective\napproach for learning arbitrary distributions on SO(3) up to a given precision.\nHowever, inference with IPDF requires $N$ forward passes through the network's\nfinal multilayer perceptron (where $N$ places an upper bound on the likelihood\nthat can be calculated by the model), which is prohibitively slow for those\nwithout the computational resources necessary to parallelize the queries. In\nthis paper, I introduce AQuaMaM, a neural network capable of both learning\ncomplex distributions on the rotation manifold and calculating exact\nlikelihoods for query rotations in a single forward pass. Specifically, AQuaMaM\nautoregressively models the projected components of unit quaternions as\nmixtures of uniform distributions that partition their geometrically-restricted\ndomain of values. When trained on an \"infinite\" toy dataset with ambiguous\nviewpoints, AQuaMaM rapidly converges to a sampling distribution closely\nmatching the true data distribution. In contrast, the sampling distribution for\nIPDF dramatically diverges from the true data distribution, despite IPDF\napproaching its theoretical minimum evaluation loss during training. When\ntrained on a constructed dataset of 500,000 renders of a die in different\nrotations, AQuaMaM reaches a test log-likelihood 14% higher than IPDF. Further,\ncompared to IPDF, AQuaMaM uses 24% fewer parameters, has a prediction\nthroughput 52$\\times$ faster on a single GPU, and converges in a similar amount\nof time during training.",

Most GPSSM works rely on the standard Gaussian process (GP) with\na preliminary kernel, such as squared exponential (SE) kernel and Mat\\'{e}rn\nkernel, which limit the model representation power and its application in\ncomplex scenarios. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel class of\nprobabilistic state-space model named TGPSSM that enriches the GP priors in the\nstandard GPSSM through parametric normalizing flow, making the state-space\nmodel more flexible and expressive. In addition, by inheriting the advantages\nof sparse representation of GP models, we propose a scalable and interpretable\nvariational learning algorithm to learn the TGPSSM and infer the latent\ndynamics simultaneously. By integrating a constrained optimization framework\nand explicitly constructing a non-Gaussian state variational distribution, the\nproposed learning algorithm enables the TGPSSM to significantly improve the\ncapabilities of state space representation and model inference. Experimental\nresults based on various synthetic and real datasets corroborate that the\nproposed TGPSSM yields superior learning and inference performance compared to\nseveral state-of-the-art methods.

The target Y (e.g.,\ntext, speech, music, image, video) is usually high-dimensional and complex, and\ncontains information that does not exist in source data, which hinders\neffective and efficient learning on the source-target mapping. In this paper,\nwe present a learning paradigm called regeneration learning for data\ngeneration, which first generates Y' (an abstraction/representation of Y) from\nX and then generates Y from Y'. During training, Y' is obtained from Y through\neither handcrafted rules or self-supervised learning and is used to learn\nX-->Y' and Y'-->Y. Regeneration learning extends the concept of representation\nlearning to data generation tasks, and can be regarded as a counterpart of\ntraditional representation learning, since 1) regeneration learning handles the\nabstraction (Y') of the target data Y for data generation while traditional\nrepresentation learning handles the abstraction (X') of source data X for data\nunderstanding; 2) both the processes of Y'-->Y in regeneration learning and\nX-->X' in representation learning can be learned in a self-supervised way\n(e.g., pre-training); 3) both the mappings from X to Y' in regeneration\nlearning and from X' to Y in representation learning are simpler than the\ndirect mapping from X to Y.

Typically, these approaches adopt a teacher-student architecture, where\nthe teacher network is trained in the source language, and the student network\nseeks to learn knowledge from the teacher network and is expected to perform\nwell in the target language. Despite the impressive performance achieved by\nthese methods, we argue that they have two limitations. Firstly, the teacher\nnetwork fails to effectively learn language-independent knowledge shared across\nlanguages due to the differences in the feature distribution between the source\nand target languages. Secondly, the student network acquires all of its\nknowledge from the teacher network and ignores the learning of target\nlanguage-specific knowledge.

This paper proposes an unsupervised\nprototype knowledge distillation network (ProKD) to address these issues.\nSpecifically, ProKD presents a contrastive learning-based prototype alignment\nmethod to achieve class feature alignment by adjusting the distance among\nprototypes in the source and target languages, boosting the teacher network's\ncapacity to acquire language-independent knowledge. In addition, ProKD\nintroduces a prototypical self-training method to learn the intrinsic structure\nof the language by retraining the student network on the target data using\nsamples' distance information from prototypes, thereby enhancing the student\nnetwork's ability to acquire language-specific knowledge.

    "title": "Logical Message Passing Networks with One-hop Inference on Atomic  Formulas",
    "abstract": "Complex Query Answering (CQA) over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) has attracted a lot\nof attention to potentially support many applications. Given that KGs are\nusually incomplete, neural models are proposed to answer logical queries by\nparameterizing set operators with complex neural networks. However, such\nmethods usually train neural set operators with a large number of entity and\nrelation embeddings from zero, where whether and how the embeddings or the\nneural set operators contribute to the performance remains not clear. In this\npaper, we propose a simple framework for complex query answering that\ndecomposes the KG embeddings from neural set operators. We propose to represent\nthe complex queries in the query graph. On top of the query graph, we propose\nthe Logical Message Passing Neural Network (LMPNN) that connects the\n\\textit{local} one-hop inferences on atomic formulas to the \\textit{global}\nlogical reasoning for complex query answering. We leverage existing effective\nKG embeddings to conduct one-hop inferences on atomic formulas, the results of\nwhich are regarded as the messages passed in LMPNN. The reasoning process over\nthe overall logical formulas is turned into the forward pass of LMPNN that\nincrementally aggregates local information to predict the answers' embeddings\nfinally. The complex logical inference across different types of queries will\nthen be learned from training examples based on the LMPNN architecture.\nTheoretically, our query-graph representation is more general than the\nprevailing operator-tree formulation, so our approach applies to a broader\nrange of complex KG queries. Empirically, our approach yields a new\nstate-of-the-art neural CQA model. Our research bridges the gap between complex\nKG query answering tasks and the long-standing achievements of knowledge graph\nrepresentation learning.",

    "abstract": "A community integrated energy system (CIES) is an important carrier of the\nenergy internet and smart city in geographical and functional terms. Its\nemergence provides a new solution to the problems of energy utilization and\nenvironmental pollution. To coordinate the integrated demand response and\nuncertainty of renewable energy generation (RGs), a data-driven two-stage\ndistributionally robust optimization (DRO) model is constructed. A\ncomprehensive norm consisting of the 1-norm and infinity-norm is used as the\nuncertainty probability distribution information set, thereby avoiding complex\nprobability density information. To address multiple uncertainties of RGs, a\ngenerative adversarial network based on the Wasserstein distance with gradient\npenalty is proposed to generate RG scenarios, which has wide applicability. To\nfurther tap the potential of the demand response, we take into account the\nambiguity of human thermal comfort and the thermal inertia of buildings. Thus,\nan integrated demand response mechanism is developed that effectively promotes\nthe consumption of renewable energy. The proposed method is simulated in an\nactual CIES in North China. In comparison with traditional stochastic\nprogramming and robust optimization, it is verified that the proposed DRO model\nproperly balances the relationship between economical operation and robustness\nwhile exhibiting stronger adaptability. Furthermore, our approach outperforms\nother commonly used DRO methods with better operational economy, lower\nrenewable power curtailment rate, and higher computational efficiency.",

In this system, the\nusers first harvest the radio-frequency energy from the AP in the downlink,\nthen adopt the harvested energy to transmit information to the AP in the uplink\nconcurrently. Two policies are considered for the proposed system. The first\none assumes that the time-switching protocol is used in the downlink while the\nenergy-splitting protocol is adopted in the uplink, named TEP. The second one\nassumes that the energy-splitting protocol is utilized in both the downlink and\nuplink, named EEP. The outage probability, sum throughput, and average age of\ninformation (AoI) of the proposed system with TEP and EEP are investigated over\nNakagami-m fading channels. In addition, we also analyze the outage\nprobability, sum throughput, and average AoI of the STAR-RIS aided\nwireless-powered time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) system. Simulation and\nnumerical results show that the proposed system with TEP and EEP outperforms\nbaseline schemes, and significantly improves sum throughput performance but\nreduces outage probability and average AoI performance compared to the STAR-RIS\naided wireless-powered TDMA system.

Recently, contrastive learning and\nTransformer-based models have achieved good performance in many long-term\nseries forecasting tasks. However, there are still several issues in existing\nmethods. First, the training paradigm of contrastive learning and downstream\nprediction tasks are inconsistent, leading to inaccurate prediction results.\nSecond, existing Transformer-based models which resort to similar patterns in\nhistorical time series data for predicting future values generally induce\nsevere distribution shift problems, and do not fully leverage the sequence\ninformation compared to self-supervised methods. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel framework named Ti-MAE, in which the input time series are\nassumed to follow an integrate distribution.

    "abstract": "Distributed deep learning (DDL) training systems are designed for cloud and\ndata-center environments that assumes homogeneous compute resources, high\nnetwork bandwidth, sufficient memory and storage, as well as independent and\nidentically distributed (IID) data across all nodes. However, these assumptions\ndon't necessarily apply on the edge, especially when training neural networks\non streaming data in an online manner. Computing on the edge suffers from both\nsystems and statistical heterogeneity. Systems heterogeneity is attributed to\ndifferences in compute resources and bandwidth specific to each device, while\nstatistical heterogeneity comes from unbalanced and skewed data on the edge.\nDifferent streaming-rates among devices can be another source of heterogeneity\nwhen dealing with streaming data. If the streaming rate is lower than training\nbatch-size, device needs to wait until enough samples have streamed in before\nperforming a single iteration of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Thus,\nlow-volume streams act like stragglers slowing down devices with high-volume\nstreams in synchronous training. On the other hand, data can accumulate quickly\nin the buffer if the streaming rate is too high and the devices can't train at\nline-rate. In this paper, we introduce ScaDLES to efficiently train on\nstreaming data at the edge in an online fashion, while also addressing the\nchallenges of limited bandwidth and training with non-IID data.

    "abstract": "Contour-based instance segmentation has been actively studied, thanks to its\nflexibility and elegance in processing visual objects within complex\nbackgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep network architecture, i.e.,\nPolySnake, for contour-based instance segmentation. Motivated by the classic\nSnake algorithm, the proposed PolySnake achieves superior and robust\nsegmentation performance with an iterative and progressive contour refinement\nstrategy. Technically, PolySnake introduces a recurrent update operator to\nestimate the object contour iteratively. It maintains a single estimate of the\ncontour that is progressively deformed toward the object boundary. At each\niteration, PolySnake builds a semantic-rich representation for the current\ncontour and feeds it to the recurrent operator for further contour adjustment.\nThrough the iterative refinements, the contour finally progressively converges\nto a stable status that tightly encloses the object instance. Moreover, with a\ncompact design of the recurrent architecture, we ensure the running efficiency\nunder multiple iterations. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the\nmerits of our method, and the results demonstrate that the proposed PolySnake\noutperforms the existing contour-based instance segmentation methods on several\nprevalent instance segmentation benchmarks. The codes and models are available\nat https://github.com/fh2019ustc/PolySnake.",

Automated claim verification methods exist to validate\nclaims, but they lack foundational data and often use mainstream news as\nevidence sources that are strongly biased towards a specific agenda. Current\nclaim verification methods use deep neural network models and complex\nalgorithms for a high classification accuracy but it is at the expense of model\nexplainability.

Building upon a class of hypergraph partitioning\nproblems introduced by Li & Milenkovic, we study the problem of minimizing\nratio-cut objectives over hypergraphs given by a new class of cut functions,\nmonotone submodular cut functions (mscf's), which captures hypergraph expansion\nand conductance as special cases.\nWe first define the ratio-cut improvement problem, a family of local\nrelaxations of the minimum ratio-cut problem. This problem is a natural\nextension of the Andersen & Lang cut improvement problem to the hypergraph\nsetting. We demonstrate the existence of efficient algorithms for approximately\nsolving this problem. These algorithms run in almost-linear time for the case\nof hypergraph expansion, and when the hypergraph rank is at most $O(1)$.\nNext, we provide an efficient $O(\\log n)$-approximation algorithm for finding\nthe minimum ratio-cut of $G$. We generalize the cut-matching game framework of\nKhandekar et. al. to allow for the cut player to play unbalanced cuts, and\nmatching player to route approximate single-commodity flows. Using this\nframework, we bootstrap our algorithms for the ratio-cut improvement problem to\nobtain approximation algorithms for minimum ratio-cut problem for all mscf's.\nThis also yields the first almost-linear time $O(\\log n)$-approximation\nalgorithms for hypergraph expansion, and constant hypergraph rank.\nFinally, we extend a result of Louis & Makarychev to a broader set of\nobjective functions by giving a polynomial time $O\\big(\\sqrt{\\log\nn}\\big)$-approximation algorithm for the minimum ratio-cut problem based on\nrounding $\\ell_2^2$-metric embeddings.",

We\nintroduce a finite completely monotonic function, which is a completely\nmonotonic function with a finite positive integral interval of the integral\nrepresentation. We consider the exponential sum approximation of a finite\ncompletely monotonic function based on the Gaussian quadrature with a variable\ntransformation. If the variable transformation is analytic on an open Bernstein\nellipse, the maximum absolute error decreases at least geometrically with\nrespect to the number of exponential functions. The error of the Gaussian\nquadrature is also expanded by basis functions associated with the variable\ntransformation. The basis functions form a Chebyshev system on the positive\nreal axis. The maximization of the decreasing rate of the error bound can be\nachieved by constructing a one-to-one mapping of an open Bernstein ellipse onto\nthe right half-plane. The mapping is realized by the composition of Jacobi's\ndelta amplitude function (also called dn function) and the multivalued inverse\ncosine function. The function is single-valued, meromorphic, and strictly\nabsolutely monotonic function. The corresponding basis functions are\neigenfunctions of a fourth order differential operator, satisfy orthogonality\nconditions, and have the interlacing property of zeros by Kellogg's theorem.

In doing so, we\ngain some interesting algebraic properties almost for free, which in turn allow\nus to define some operations that can allow to perform an in-depth performance\nregression analysis. The typical documented use of a flame graph is via its\ngraphical representation, whereby one scans the picture for the largest\nplateaux. Whilst this method is effective at finding the main sources of\nperformance issues, it leaves quite a large amount of data potentially unused.\nBy combining a mathematical precise definition of flame graphs with some\nstatistical methods we show how to generalise this visual procedure and make\nthe best of the full set of collected profiling data.",

This makes the agent fail to\nperform like humans. In this paper, we introduce a time-conditioned generative\nmodel for videos.

In recent years,\npersonalized federated learning (pFL) has emerged as a potential solution to\nthe challenges presented by heterogeneous data. However, existing pFL methods\ntypically enhance performance of local models at the expense of the global\nmodel's accuracy. We propose FedHKD (Federated Hyper-Knowledge Distillation), a\nnovel FL algorithm in which clients rely on knowledge distillation (KD) to\ntrain local models. In particular, each client extracts and sends to the server\nthe means of local data representations and the corresponding soft predictions\n-- information that we refer to as ``hyper-knowledge\". The server aggregates\nthis information and broadcasts it to the clients in support of local training.\nNotably, unlike other KD-based pFL methods, FedHKD does not rely on a public\ndataset nor it deploys a generative model at the server. We analyze convergence\nof FedHKD and conduct extensive experiments on visual datasets in a variety of\nscenarios, demonstrating that FedHKD provides significant improvement in both\npersonalized as well as global model performance compared to state-of-the-art\nFL methods designed for heterogeneous data settings.",

    "abstract": "With the growing model size, deep neural networks (DNN) are increasingly\ntrained over massive GPU accelerators, which demands a proper parallelization\nplan that transforms a DNN model into fine-grained tasks and then schedules\nthem to GPUs for execution. Due to the large search space, the contemporary\nparallelization plan generators often rely on empirical rules that couple\ntransformation and scheduling, and fall short in exploring more flexible\nschedules that yield better memory usage and compute efficiency. This tension\ncan be exacerbated by the emerging models with increasing complexity in their\nstructure and model size. SuperScaler is a system that facilitates the design\nand generation of highly flexible parallelization plans. It formulates the plan\ndesign and generation into three sequential phases explicitly: model\ntransformation, space-time scheduling, and data dependency preserving. Such a\nprincipled approach decouples multiple seemingly intertwined factors and\nenables the composition of highly flexible parallelization plans. As a result,\nSuperScaler can not only generate empirical parallelization plans, but also\nconstruct new plans that achieve up to 3.5X speedup compared to\nstate-of-the-art solutions like DeepSpeed, Megatron and Alpa, for emerging DNN\nmodels like Swin-Transformer and AlphaFold2, as well as well-optimized models\nlike GPT-3.",

    "abstract": "The pursuit of long-term fairness involves the interplay between\ndecision-making and the underlying data generating process. In this paper,\nthrough causal modeling with a directed acyclic graph (DAG) on the\ndecision-distribution interplay, we investigate the possibility of achieving\nlong-term fairness from a dynamic perspective. We propose Tier Balancing, a\ntechnically more challenging but more natural notion to achieve in the context\nof long-term, dynamic fairness analysis. Different from previous fairness\nnotions that are defined purely on observed variables, our notion goes one step\nfurther, capturing behind-the-scenes situation changes on the unobserved latent\ncausal factors that directly carry out the influence from the current decision\nto the future data distribution. Under the specified dynamics, we prove that in\ngeneral one cannot achieve the long-term fairness goal only through one-step\ninterventions. Furthermore, in the effort of approaching long-term fairness, we\nconsider the mission of \"getting closer to\" the long-term fairness goal and\npresent possibility and impossibility results accordingly.",

The goal is to find a maximum-weight\nsubset $M\\subseteq E$ of the edges satisfying the following two conditions: 1)\nthe degree of each node $v\\in S\\cup T$ is at most $b(v)$ in $M$, 2) if\n$s_it,s_jt\\in M$, then $|i-j|\\geq d$. In the cyclic version of the problem, the\nnodes in $S$ are considered to be in cyclic order. We get back the\n\\emph{(cyclic) $d$-distance matching problem} when $b(s) = 1$ for $s\\in S$ and\n$b(t) = \\infty$ for $t\\in T$.\nWe prove that the $d$-distance matching problem is APX-hard even in the\nunweighted case. We show that $(2-\\frac{1}{d})$ is a tight upper bound on the\nintegrality gap of the natural integer programming model for the cyclic\n$d$-distance $b$-matching problem provided that $(2d-1)$ divides the size of\n$S$. For the non-cyclic case, the integrality gap is shown to be at most\n$(2-\\frac{2}{d})$. The proofs give approximation algorithms with guarantees\nmatching these bounds, and also improve the best known algorithms for the\n(cyclic) $d$-distance matching problem. In a related problem, our goal is to\nfind a permutation of $S$ maximizing the weight of the optimal $d$-distance\n$b$-matching. This problem can be solved in polynomial time for the (cyclic)\n$d$-distance matching problem -- even though the (cyclic) $d$-distance matching\nproblem itself is NP-hard and also hard to approximate arbitrarily.

This brings\nabout different interesting domains for analysis; emotion expressed by the\nwriter and emotion elicited from the readers. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach for Readers' Emotion Detection from short-text documents using a deep\nlearning model called REDAffectiveLM. Within state-of-the-art NLP tasks, it is\nwell understood that utilizing context-specific representations from\ntransformer-based pre-trained language models helps achieve improved\nperformance. Within this affective computing task, we explore how incorporating\naffective information can further enhance performance. Towards this, we\nleverage context-specific and affect enriched representations by using a\ntransformer-based pre-trained language model in tandem with affect enriched\nBi-LSTM+Attention. For empirical evaluation, we procure a new dataset REN-20k,\nbesides using RENh-4k and SemEval-2007. We evaluate the performance of our\nREDAffectiveLM rigorously across these datasets, against a vast set of\nstate-of-the-art baselines, where our model consistently outperforms baselines\nand obtains statistically significant results. Our results establish that\nutilizing affect enriched representation along with context-specific\nrepresentation within a neural architecture can considerably enhance readers'\nemotion detection. Since the impact of affect enrichment specifically in\nreaders' emotion detection isn't well explored, we conduct a detailed analysis\nover affect enriched Bi-LSTM+Attention using qualitative and quantitative model\nbehavior evaluation techniques. We observe that compared to conventional\nsemantic embedding, affect enriched embedding increases ability of the network\nto effectively identify and assign weightage to key terms responsible for\nreaders' emotion detection.",

Recent efforts adopted\na two-stage framework that first builds 2D pose estimations in multiple camera\nviews from different perspectives and then synthesizes them into 3D poses.\nHowever, the focus has largely been on developing new computer vision\nalgorithms on the offline video datasets without much consideration on the\nenergy constraints in real-world systems with flexibly-deployed and\nbattery-powered cameras. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient\nedge-assisted multiple-camera system, dubbed E$^3$Pose, for real-time\nmulti-human 3D pose estimation, based on the key idea of adaptive camera\nselection. Instead of always employing all available cameras to perform 2D pose\nestimations as in the existing works, E$^3$Pose selects only a subset of\ncameras depending on their camera view qualities in terms of occlusion and\nenergy states in an adaptive manner, thereby reducing the energy consumption\n(which translates to extended battery lifetime) and improving the estimation\naccuracy. To achieve this goal, E$^3$Pose incorporates an attention-based LSTM\nto predict the occlusion information of each camera view and guide camera\nselection before cameras are selected to process the images of a scene, and\nruns a camera selection algorithm based on the Lyapunov optimization framework\nto make long-term adaptive selection decisions. We build a prototype of\nE$^3$Pose on a 5-camera testbed, demonstrate its feasibility and evaluate its\nperformance.

This paper demonstrates how to beat industrial performance and\nachieve 1.92 PESQ and 0.88 STOI, as well as superior acoustic fidelity,\nperceptual quality, and intelligibility in various metrics.",

    "abstract": "Constraint-based causal discovery algorithms learn part of the causal graph\nstructure by systematically testing conditional independences observed in the\ndata. These algorithms, such as the PC algorithm and its variants, rely on\ngraphical characterizations of the so-called equivalence class of causal graphs\nproposed by Pearl. However, constraint-based causal discovery algorithms\nstruggle when data is limited since conditional independence tests quickly lose\ntheir statistical power, especially when the conditioning set is large. To\naddress this, we propose using conditional independence tests where the size of\nthe conditioning set is upper bounded by some integer $k$ for robust causal\ndiscovery. The existing graphical characterizations of the equivalence classes\nof causal graphs are not applicable when we cannot leverage all the conditional\nindependence statements. We first define the notion of $k$-Markov equivalence:\nTwo causal graphs are $k$-Markov equivalent if they entail the same conditional\nindependence constraints where the conditioning set size is upper bounded by\n$k$. We propose a novel representation that allows us to graphically\ncharacterize $k$-Markov equivalence between two causal graphs. We propose a\nsound constraint-based algorithm called the $k$-PC algorithm for learning this\nequivalence class. Finally, we conduct synthetic, and semi-synthetic\nexperiments to demonstrate that the $k$-PC algorithm enables more robust causal\ndiscovery in the small sample regime compared to the baseline PC algorithm.",

By (visually) transporting users from the real or physical\nworld to exciting and realistic virtual spaces, VR systems can enable\ntrue-to-life and more interactive versions of traditional applications such as\ngaming, remote conferencing, social networking and virtual tourism. However, as\nwith any new consumer technology, VR applications also present significant\nuser-privacy challenges.

Specifically, this paper analyzes the feasibility of carrying out a\nde-anonymization or identification attack on VR users by correlating visually\nobserved movements of users' avatars in the virtual world with some auxiliary\ndata (e.g., motion sensor data from mobile/wearable devices held by users)\nrepresenting their context/state in the physical world. To enable this attack,\nthis paper proposes a novel framework which first employs a learning-based\nactivity classification approach to translate the disparate visual movement\ndata and motion sensor data into an activity-vector to ease comparison,\nfollowed by a filtering and identity ranking phase outputting an ordered list\nof potential identities corresponding to the target visual movement data.\nExtensive empirical evaluation of the proposed framework, under a comprehensive\nset of experimental settings, demonstrates the feasibility of such a\nde-anonymization attack.",

Prevailing CEMs can be categorized into match-based CEMs (e.g.,\nBLEU, Accuracy, and CodeBLEU) and execution-based CEMs (e.g., AvgPassRatio and\nPass@k), but both of them suffer from some issues. The former only measures\ndifferences in surface form regardless of the functional equivalence of codes,\nwhile the latter has huge execution overheads, including collecting expensive\ntest cases, resolving tedious execution dependencies, and enormous execution\ntime. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose CodeScore, an\nefficient and effective CEM for code generation, which estimates test case\nPassRatio of generated code without executing code. We also present a framework\nnamed UniCE for training unified code evaluation models by learning code\nexecution, i.e., learning PassRatio and Executability of generated code. In\norder to learn code execution comprehensively, we construct more than 100 test\ncases for each task in several popular benchmark datasets, covering MBPP, APPS,\nand HumanEval. Experimental results show that CodeScore has obtained a\nstate-of-the-art correlation with execution-based CEMs. CodeScore is strongly\ncorrelated with AvgPassPatio, and binary CodeScore is moderately correlated\nwith Pass@1. In particular, CodeScore eliminates the need for test cases and\nexecution dependencies in inference, and CodeScore reduces execution time by\nthree orders of magnitude compared to AvgPassPatio and Pass@1.",

This work was\npartially later published in IEEE Transactions on Reliability. Very good\napproximations for the closed-form solutions for this general model are also\ninvestigated. Various storage configurations under different policies are\ncompared using such advanced models.

It is not hard to anticipate such a system structure would most likely\nbe part of future DNA storage libraries. This work is partially published in\nElsevier Reliability and System Safety. Topics that include simulation\nmodelings for more accurate estimations are included towards the end of the\ndocument by noting the deficiencies of the simplified canonical as well as more\ncomplex Markov models, due mainly to the stationary and static nature of\nMarkovinity.

    "title": "Provable Unrestricted Adversarial Training without Compromise with  Generalizability",
    "abstract": "Adversarial training (AT) is widely considered as the most promising strategy\nto defend against adversarial attacks and has drawn increasing interest from\nresearchers. However, the existing AT methods still suffer from two challenges.\nFirst, they are unable to handle unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs),\nwhich are built from scratch, as opposed to restricted adversarial examples\n(RAEs), which are created by adding perturbations bound by an $l_p$ norm to\nobserved examples. Second, the existing AT methods often achieve adversarial\nrobustness at the expense of standard generalizability (i.e., the accuracy on\nnatural examples) because they make a tradeoff between them. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose a unique viewpoint that understands UAEs as\nimperceptibly perturbed unobserved examples. Also, we find that the tradeoff\nresults from the separation of the distributions of adversarial examples and\nnatural examples. Based on these ideas, we propose a novel AT approach called\nProvable Unrestricted Adversarial Training (PUAT), which can provide a target\nclassifier with comprehensive adversarial robustness against both UAE and RAE,\nand simultaneously improve its standard generalizability. Particularly, PUAT\nutilizes partially labeled data to achieve effective UAE generation by\naccurately capturing the natural data distribution through a novel augmented\ntriple-GAN. At the same time, PUAT extends the traditional AT by introducing\nthe supervised loss of the target classifier into the adversarial loss and\nachieves the alignment between the UAE distribution, the natural data\ndistribution, and the distribution learned by the classifier, with the\ncollaboration of the augmented triple-GAN. Finally, the solid theoretical\nanalysis and extensive experiments conducted on widely-used benchmarks\ndemonstrate the superiority of PUAT.",

    "abstract": "This work focuses on the design of modern power system controllers for\nautomatic voltage regulators (AVR) and the applications of machine learning\n(ML) algorithms to correctly classify the stability of the IEEE 14 bus system.\nThe LQG controller performs the best time domain characteristics compared to\nPID and LQG, while the sensor and amplifier gain is changed in a dynamic\npassion. After that, the IEEE 14 bus system is modeled, and contingency\nscenarios are simulated in the System Modelica Dymola environment. Application\nof the Monte Carlo principle with modified Poissons probability distribution\nprinciple is reviewed from the literature that reduces the total contingency\nfrom 1000k to 20k. The damping ratio of the contingency is then extracted,\npre-processed, and fed to ML algorithms, such as logistic regression, support\nvector machine, decision trees, random forests, Naive Bayes, and k-nearest\nneighbor. A neural network (NN) of one, two, three, five, seven, and ten hidden\nlayers with 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% data size is considered to observe and\ncompare the prediction time, accuracy, precision, and recall value. At lower\ndata size, 25%, in the neural network with two-hidden layers and a single\nhidden layer, the accuracy becomes 95.70% and 97.38%, respectively. Increasing\nthe hidden layer of NN beyond a second does not increase the overall score and\ntakes a much longer prediction time; thus could be discarded for similar\nanalysis. Moreover, when five, seven, and ten hidden layers are used, the F1\nscore reduces. However, in practical scenarios, where the data set contains\nmore features and a variety of classes, higher data size is required for NN for\nproper training. This research will provide more insight into the damping\nratio-based system stability prediction with traditional ML algorithms and\nneural networks.",

    "title": "Variational Cross-Graph Reasoning and Adaptive Structured Semantics  Learning for Compositional Temporal Grounding",
    "abstract": "Temporal grounding is the task of locating a specific segment from an\nuntrimmed video according to a query sentence. This task has achieved\nsignificant momentum in the computer vision community as it enables activity\ngrounding beyond pre-defined activity classes by utilizing the semantic\ndiversity of natural language descriptions. The semantic diversity is rooted in\nthe principle of compositionality in linguistics, where novel semantics can be\nsystematically described by combining known words in novel ways (compositional\ngeneralization). However, existing temporal grounding datasets are not\ncarefully designed to evaluate the compositional generalizability. To\nsystematically benchmark the compositional generalizability of temporal\ngrounding models, we introduce a new Compositional Temporal Grounding task and\nconstruct two new dataset splits, i.e., Charades-CG and ActivityNet-CG. When\nevaluating the state-of-the-art methods on our new dataset splits, we\nempirically find that they fail to generalize to queries with novel\ncombinations of seen words. We argue that the inherent structured semantics\ninside the videos and language is the crucial factor to achieve compositional\ngeneralization. Based on this insight, we propose a variational cross-graph\nreasoning framework that explicitly decomposes video and language into\nhierarchical semantic graphs, respectively, and learns fine-grained semantic\ncorrespondence between the two graphs. Furthermore, we introduce a novel\nadaptive structured semantics learning approach to derive the\nstructure-informed and domain-generalizable graph representations, which\nfacilitate the fine-grained semantic correspondence reasoning between the two\ngraphs. Extensive experiments validate the superior compositional\ngeneralizability of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Recent works have revealed the superiority of feature-level fusion for\ncross-modal 3D object detection, where fine-grained feature propagation from 2D\nimage pixels to 3D LiDAR points has been widely adopted for performance\nimprovement. Still, the potential of heterogeneous feature propagation between\n2D and 3D domains has not been fully explored. In this paper, in contrast to\nexisting pixel-to-point feature propagation, we investigate an opposite\npoint-to-pixel direction, allowing point-wise features to flow inversely into\nthe 2D image branch. Thus, when jointly optimizing the 2D and 3D streams, the\ngradients back-propagated from the 2D image branch can boost the representation\nability of the 3D backbone network working on LiDAR point clouds. Then,\ncombining pixel-to-point and point-to-pixel information flow mechanisms, we\nconstruct an bidirectional feature propagation framework, dubbed BiProDet. In\naddition to the architectural design, we also propose normalized local\ncoordinates map estimation, a new 2D auxiliary task for the training of the 2D\nimage branch, which facilitates learning local spatial-aware features from the\nimage modality and implicitly enhances the overall 3D detection performance.\nExtensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our\nmethod.

Although previous methods\nproduce realistic images, they suffer from unstable training or degenerate\nsolutions where the 3D geometry is unnatural. We hypothesize that the 3D\ngeometry is underdetermined due to the insufficient constraint, i.e., being\nclassified as real image to the discriminator is not enough. To solve this\nproblem, we propose to approximate the background as a spherical surface and\nrepresent a scene as a union of the foreground placed in the sphere and the\nthin spherical background. It reduces the degree of freedom in the background\nfield. Accordingly, we modify the volume rendering equation and incorporate\ndedicated constraints to design a novel 3D-aware GAN framework named BallGAN.\nBallGAN has multiple advantages as follows. 1) It produces more reasonable 3D\ngeometry; the images of a scene across different viewpoints have better\nphotometric consistency and fidelity than the state-of-the-art methods. 2) The\ntraining becomes much more stable. 3) The foreground can be separately rendered\non top of different arbitrary backgrounds.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of open-vocabulary semantic\nsegmentation (OVS), which aims to segment objects of arbitrary classes instead\nof pre-defined, closed-set categories. The main contributions are as follows:\nFirst, we propose a transformer-based model for OVS, termed as OVSegmentor,\nwhich only exploits web-crawled image-text pairs for pre-training without using\nany mask annotations. OVSegmentor assembles the image pixels into a set of\nlearnable group tokens via a slot-attention based binding module, and aligns\nthe group tokens to the corresponding caption embedding. Second, we propose two\nproxy tasks for training, namely masked entity completion and cross-image mask\nconsistency. The former aims to infer all masked entities in the caption given\nthe group tokens, that enables the model to learn fine-grained alignment\nbetween visual groups and text entities. The latter enforces consistent mask\npredictions between images that contain shared entities, which encourages the\nmodel to learn visual invariance. Third, we construct CC4M dataset for\npre-training by filtering CC12M with frequently appeared entities, which\nsignificantly improves training efficiency. Fourth, we perform zero-shot\ntransfer on three benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO\nObject. Our model achieves superior segmentation results over the\nstate-of-the-art method by using only 3\\% data (4M vs 134M) for pre-training.\nCode and pre-trained models will be released for future research.",

    "abstract": "Generative Networks have proved to be extremely effective in image\nrestoration and reconstruction in the past few years. Generating faces from\ntextual descriptions is one such application where the power of generative\nalgorithms can be used. The task of generating faces can be useful for a number\nof applications such as finding missing persons, identifying criminals, etc.\nThis paper discusses a novel approach to generating human faces given a textual\ndescription regarding the facial features. We use the power of state of the art\nnatural language processing models to convert face descriptions into learnable\nlatent vectors which are then fed to a generative adversarial network which\ngenerates faces corresponding to those features. While this paper focuses on\nhigh level descriptions of faces only, the same approach can be tailored to\ngenerate any image based on fine grained textual features.",

    "abstract": "Community detection is an essential task in network analysis as it helps\nidentify groups and patterns within a network. High-speed community detection\nalgorithms are necessary to analyze large-scale networks in a reasonable amount\nof time. Researchers have made significant contributions in the development of\nhigh-speed community detection algorithms, particularly in the area of\nlabel-propagation based disjoint community detection. These algorithms have\nbeen proven to be highly effective in analyzing large-scale networks in a\nreasonable amount of time. However, it is important to evaluate the performance\nand accuracy of these existing methods to determine which algorithm is best\nsuited for a particular type of network and specific research problem. In this\nreport, we investigate the RAK, COPRA, and SLPA, three label-propagation-based\nstatic community discovery techniques. We pay close attention to each\nalgorithm's minute details as we implement both its single-threaded and\nmulti-threaded OpenMP-based variants, making any necessary adjustments or\noptimizations and obtaining the right parameter values. The RAK algorithm is\nfound to perform well with a tolerance of 0.05 and OpenMP-based strict RAK with\n12 threads was 6.75x faster than the sequential non-strict RAK. The COPRA\nalgorithm works well with a single label for road networks and max labels of\n4-16 for other classes of graphs. The SLPA algorithm performs well with\nincreasing memory size, but overall doesn't offer a favourable return on\ninvestment. The RAK algorithm is recommended for label-propagation based\ndisjoint community detection.",

The proposed moment propagation procedure can compute exact\nmoments for non-Gaussian as well as non-independent Gaussian random variables.\nThus, MKF can propagate exact moments of uncertain state variables up to any\ndesired order. MKF is derivative-free and does not require tuning parameters.\nMoreover, MKF has the same computation time complexity as the extended or\nunscented Kalman filters, i.e., EKF and UKF.

Recently, many learning-based\nmethods have been proposed to tackle this challenge, with imitation learning\nshowing great promise. However, imperfect demonstrations and a lack of feedback\nfrom teleoperation systems may lead to poor or even unsafe results. In this\nwork we explore the effect of demonstrator force feedback on imitation\nlearning, using a feedback glove and a robot arm to render fingertip-level and\npalm-level forces, respectively. 10 participants recorded 5 demonstrations of a\npick-and-place task with 3 grippers, under conditions with no force feedback,\nfingertip force feedback, and fingertip and palm force feedback. Results show\nthat force feedback significantly reduces demonstrator fingertip and palm\nforces, leads to a lower variation in demonstrator forces, and recorded\ntrajectories that a quicker to execute. Using behavioral cloning, we find that\nagents trained to imitate these trajectories mirror these benefits, even though\nagents have no force data shown to them during training. We conclude that\nimmersive demonstrations, achieved with force feedback, may be the key to\nunlocking safer, quicker to execute dexterous manipulation policies.",

    "abstract": "In their seminal work, Nayyar et al. (2013) showed that imperfect information\ncan be abstracted away from common-payoff games by having players publicly\nannounce their policies as they play. This insight underpins sound solvers and\ndecision-time planning algorithms for common-payoff games. Unfortunately, a\nnaive application of the same insight to two-player zero-sum games fails\nbecause Nash equilibria of the game with public policy announcements may not\ncorrespond to Nash equilibria of the original game. As a consequence, existing\nsound decision-time planning algorithms require complicated additional\nmechanisms that have unappealing properties. The main contribution of this work\nis showing that certain regularized equilibria do not possess the\naforementioned non-correspondence problem -- thus, computing them can be\ntreated as perfect information problems. Because these regularized equilibria\ncan be made arbitrarily close to Nash equilibria, our result opens the door to\na new perspective on solving two-player zero-sum games and, in particular,\nyields a simplified framework for decision-time planning in two-player zero-sum\ngames, void of the unappealing properties that plague existing decision-time\nplanning approaches.",

Here a top-down planar approach is presented by introducing\nKirigami-inspired engineering combined with a pre-stretching process. Using\nthis method, Kirigami-Pre-stretched Substrate-Kirigami trilayered precursors\nare created in a planar manner; upon release, the strain mismatch -- due to the\npre-stretching of substrate -- between layers would induce an out-of-plane\nbuckling to achieve targeted three dimensional (3D) bistable structures. By\ncombining experimental characterization, analytical modeling, and finite\nelement simulation, the effect of the pattern size of Kirigami layers and\npre-stretching on the geometry and stability of resulting 3D composites is\nexplored. In addition, methods to realize soft bistable structures with\narbitrary shapes and soft composites with multistable configurations are\ninvestigated, which could encourage further applications.

For\nexample, all non-cospectral graph pairs are distinguished by the proposed\ncombinatorial method, furthermore, even non-isomorphic cospectral graphs can be\ndistinguished assuming certain properties of their eigenspaces.\nWe also investigate a refinement of the aforementioned labeling, called\n$\\mathfrak{s}^k$-labeling, which has both theoretical and practical\napplications. Among others, it can be used to generate graph fingerprints,\nwhich uniquely identify all graphs in the considered databases, including all\nstrongly regular graphs on at most 64 nodes and all graphs on at most 12 nodes.\nIt provably identifies all trees and 3-connected planar graphs up to\nisomorphism, which -- as a byproduct -- gives a new isomorphism algorithm for\nboth graph classes. The practical importance of this fingerprint lies in\nsignificantly speeding up searching in graph databases, which is a commonly\nrequired task in biological and chemical applications.",

However, the temporary nature of the platform and\nthe security guidelines that remove malicious content make studying this\ndisinformation a challenge. The only way to access removed content and banned\naccounts that are no longer on the live web is by searching the web archives.\nIn this study, we set out to quantify the replayability and quality of past\ncaptures of Instagram account pages, specifically focusing on a group of\nanti-vaxx content creators known as the Disinformation Dozen. We found that the\nnumber of mementos listed for these users' account pages on the Internet\nArchive's Wayback Machine can be misleading, because a majority of the mementos\nare actually redirections to the Instagram login page, and of the remaining\nreplayable mementos, many are missing post images. In fact, 96.13% of mementos\nfrom the Disinformation Dozen accounts redirect to the login page, and only\n27.16% of the remaining replayable mementos contain every post image. Combined,\nthese results reveal that merely 1.05% of mementos for the Disinformation Dozen\naccounts are replayable with complete post images. Furthermore, we found that\nthe percentage of replayable mementos is decreasing over time, with a\nparticular lack of replayable mementos for the years 2021 and 2022.",

To reduce such manual effort, in this paper, we curate\nSPEC5G the first-ever public 5G dataset for NLP research.

In this paper, to\nimprove the learning ability of RC, we propose self-modulated RC (SM-RC), which\nextends RC by adding a self-modulation mechanism. The self-modulation mechanism\nis realized with two gating variables: an input gate and a reservoir gate. The\ninput gate modulates the input signal, and the reservoir gate modulates the\ndynamical properties of the reservoir. We demonstrated that SM-RC can perform\nattention tasks where input information is retained or discarded depending on\nthe input signal. We also found that a chaotic state emerged as a result of\nlearning in SM-RC. This indicates that self-modulation mechanisms provide RC\nwith qualitatively different information-processing capabilities. Furthermore,\nSM-RC outperformed RC in NARMA and Lorentz model tasks. In particular, SM-RC\nachieved a higher prediction accuracy than RC with a reservoir 10 times larger\nin the Lorentz model tasks. Because the SM-RC architecture only requires two\nadditional gates, it is physically implementable as RC, providing a new\ndirection for realizing edge AI.",

However, the remarkable discrepancy between the subject-dependent EEG\nrepresentation and the semantic-dependent text representation poses a great\nchallenge to this task. To mitigate this challenge, we devise a Curriculum\nSemantic-aware Contrastive Learning strategy (C-SCL), which effectively\nre-calibrates the subject-dependent EEG representation to the\nsemantic-dependent EEG representation, thus reducing the discrepancy.\nSpecifically, our C-SCL pulls semantically similar EEG representations together\nwhile pushing apart dissimilar ones. Besides, in order to introduce more\nmeaningful contrastive pairs, we carefully employ curriculum learning to not\nonly craft meaningful contrastive pairs but also make the learning\nprogressively. We conduct extensive experiments on the ZuCo benchmark and our\nmethod combined with diverse models and architectures shows stable improvements\nacross three types of metrics while achieving the new state-of-the-art.

Increased\nFLOPs consequently lead to higher wall-clock time and increased label flipping\nleads to poorer streaming performance.

HEAR has a Hybrid unidirectional-bidirectional encoder architecture to\nperform sequence tagging, along with an Adaptive Restart Module (ARM) to\nselectively guide the restart of bidirectional portion of the encoder.

To overcome this limitation, we\njointly investigate three novel criteria in our framework Crb for point cloud\nacquisition - label conciseness}, feature representativeness and geometric\nbalance, which hierarchically filters out the point clouds of redundant 3D\nbounding box labels, latent features and geometric characteristics (e.g., point\ncloud density) from the unlabeled sample pool and greedily selects informative\nones with fewer objects to annotate. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that\nthe proposed criteria align the marginal distributions of the selected subset\nand the prior distributions of the unseen test set, and minimizes the upper\nbound of the generalization error. To validate the effectiveness and\napplicability of \\textsc{Crb}, we conduct extensive experiments on the two\nbenchmark 3D object detection datasets of KITTI and Waymo and examine both\none-stage (\\textit{i.e.}, \\textsc{Second}) and two-stage 3D detectors (i.e.,\nPv-rcnn).

    "abstract": "Reconstructing 3D point clouds into triangle meshes is a key problem in\ncomputational geometry and surface reconstruction. Point cloud triangulation\nsolves this problem by providing edge information to the input points. Since no\nvertex interpolation is involved, it is beneficial to preserve sharp details on\nthe surface. Taking advantage of learning-based techniques in triangulation,\nexisting methods enumerate the complete combinations of candidate triangles,\nwhich is both complex and inefficient. In this paper, we leverage the duality\nbetween a triangle and its circumcenter, and introduce a deep neural network\nthat detects the circumcenters to achieve point cloud triangulation.\nSpecifically, we introduce multiple anchor priors to divide the neighborhood\nspace of each point. The neural network then learns to predict the presences\nand locations of circumcenters under the guidance of those anchors. We extract\nthe triangles dual to the detected circumcenters to form a primitive mesh, from\nwhich an edge-manifold mesh is produced via simple post-processing. Unlike\nexisting learning-based triangulation methods, the proposed method bypasses an\nexhaustive enumeration of triangle combinations and local surface\nparameterization.

This paper proposes ``\\emph{${\\bf\nM}$-magnitude weighted $L_{\\bf 2}$ distortion + $\\bf 2$ degrees of freedom''}\n(M22) algorithm, a rate-distortion inspired approach to gradient compression\nfor federated training of deep neural networks (DNNs). In particular, we\npropose a family of distortion measures between the original gradient and the\nreconstruction we referred to as ``$M$-magnitude weighted $L_2$'' distortion,\nand we assume that gradient updates follow an i.i.d. distribution --\ngeneralized normal or Weibull, which have two degrees of freedom. In both the\ndistortion measure and the gradient, there is one free parameter for each that\ncan be fitted as a function of the iteration number. Given a choice of gradient\ndistribution and distortion measure, we design the quantizer minimizing the\nexpected distortion in gradient reconstruction. To measure the gradient\ncompression performance under a communication constraint, we define the\n\\emph{per-bit accuracy} as the optimal improvement in accuracy that one bit of\ncommunication brings to the centralized model over the training period. Using\nthis performance measure, we systematically benchmark the choice of gradient\ndistribution and distortion measure. We provide substantial insights on the\nrole of these choices and argue that significant performance improvements can\nbe attained using such a rate-distortion inspired compressor.",

    "abstract": "As we increase the number of personal computing devices that we carry (mobile\ndevices, tablets, e-readers, and laptops) and these come equipped with\nincreasing resources, there is a vast potential computation power that can be\nutilized from those devices. Edge computing promises to exploit these\nunderlying computation resources closer to users to help run latency-sensitive\napplications such as augmented reality and video analytics. However, one key\nmissing piece has been how to incorporate personally owned unmanaged devices\ninto a usable edge computing system. The primary challenges arise due to the\nheterogeneity, lack of interference management, and unpredictable availability\nof such devices. In this paper we propose an orchestration framework IBDASH,\nwhich orchestrates application tasks on an edge system that comprises a mix of\ncommercial and personal edge devices. IBDASH targets reducing both end-to-end\nlatency of execution and probability of failure for applications that have\ndependency among tasks, captured by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). IBDASH\ntakes memory constraints of each edge device and network bandwidth into\nconsideration. To assess the effectiveness of IBDASH, we run real application\ntasks on real edge devices with widely varying capabilities.We feed these\nmeasurements into a simulator that runs IBDASH at scale. Compared to three\nstate-of-the-art edge orchestration schemes, LAVEA, Petrel, and LaTS, and two\nintuitive baselines, IBDASH reduces the end-to-end latency and probability of\nfailure, by 14% and 41% on average respectively. The main takeaway from our\nwork is that it is feasible to combine personal and commercial devices into a\nusable edge computing platform, one that delivers low latency and predictable\nand high availability.",

Different from the homogeneous\nblocklength case, the strong users with short blocklength transmitted symbol\nblocks usually cannot wait to receive the entire transmission frame and perform\nsuccessive interference cancellation (SIC) owing to their stringent latency\nrequirements. Even if SIC is feasible, it may not be perfect under finite\nblocklength constraints. To cope with the heterogeneity in latency and\nreliability requirements, we propose a practical downlink transmission scheme\nwith discrete signaling and single-user decoding, i.e., without SIC. In\naddition, we derive the finite blocklength achievable rate and use it for\nguiding the design of channel coding and modulations.

We\nuse GWL to characterise the expressive power of geometric GNNs that are\ninvariant or equivariant to physical symmetries in terms of distinguishing\ngeometric graphs. GWL unpacks how key design choices influence geometric GNN\nexpressivity: (1) Invariant layers have limited expressivity as they cannot\ndistinguish one-hop identical geometric graphs; (2) Equivariant layers\ndistinguish a larger class of graphs by propagating geometric information\nbeyond local neighbourhoods; (3) Higher order tensors and scalarisation enable\nmaximally powerful geometric GNNs; and (4) GWL's discrimination-based\nperspective is equivalent to universal approximation.

Therefore, near\nreal-time mapping of natural hazards is an emerging priority for the support of\nnatural disaster relief, risk management, and informing governmental policy\ndecisions. Recent methods to achieve near real-time mapping increasingly\nleverage deep learning (DL). However, DL-based approaches are designed for one\nspecific task in a single geographic region based on specific frequency bands\nof satellite data.

Without access to any data from the target domain, we\ndemonstrate this improved generalizability across four U-Net architectures for\nthe segmentation of unseen natural hazards. Importantly, our method is\ninvariant to geographic differences and differences in the type of frequency\nbands of satellite data. By leveraging characteristics of unlabeled images from\nthe target domain that are publicly available, our approach is able to further\nimprove the generalization behavior without fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "Wide-area damping control for inter-area oscillation (IAO) is critical to\nmodern power systems. The recent breakthroughs in deep learning and the broad\ndeployment of phasor measurement units (PMU) promote the development of\ndatadriven IAO damping controllers. In this paper, the damping control of IAOs\nis modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved by the proposed Deep\nDeterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) based deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\napproach. The proposed approach optimizes the eigenvalue distribution of the\nsystem, which determines the IAO modes in nature. The eigenvalues are evaluated\nby the data-driven method called dynamic mode decomposition. For a given power\nsystem, only a subset of generators selected by participation factors needs to\nbe controlled, alleviating the control and computing burdens. A Switching\nControl Strategy (SCS) is introduced to improve the transient response of IAOs.\nNumerical simulations of the IEEE-39 New England power grid model validate the\neffectiveness and advanced performance of the proposed approach as well as its\nrobustness against communication delays. In addition, we demonstrate the\ntransfer ability of the DRL model trained on the linearized power grid model to\nprovide effective IAO damping control in the non-linear power grid model\nenvironment.",

    "abstract": "To facilitate both the detection and the interpretation of findings in chest\nX-rays, comparison with a previous image of the same patient is very valuable\nto radiologists. Today, the most common approach for deep learning methods to\nautomatically inspect chest X-rays disregards the patient history and\nclassifies only single images as normal or abnormal. Nevertheless, several\nmethods for assisting in the task of comparison through image registration have\nbeen proposed in the past. However, as we illustrate, they tend to miss\nspecific types of pathological changes like cardiomegaly and effusion. Due to\nassumptions on fixed anatomical structures or their measurements of\nregistration quality they tend to produce unnaturally deformed warp fields\nimpacting visualization of the difference image between moving and fixed\nimages. To overcome these limitations, we are the first to use a new paradigm\nbased on individual rib pair segmentation for anatomy penalized registration,\nwhich proves a natural way to limit folding of the warp field, especially\nbeneficial for image pairs with large pathological changes. We show that it is\npossible to develop a deep learning powered solution that can visualize what\nother methods overlook on a large data set of paired public images, starting\nfrom less than 25 fully labeled and 50 partly labeled training images,\nemploying sequential instance memory segmentation with hole dropout, weak\nlabeling, coarse-to-fine refinement and Gaussian mixture model histogram\nmatching.

    "abstract": "Short spanning trees subject to additional constraints are important building\nblocks in various approximation algorithms. Especially in the context of the\nTraveling Salesman Problem (TSP), new techniques for finding spanning trees\nwith well-defined properties have been crucial in recent progress. We consider\nthe problem of finding a spanning tree subject to constraints on the edges in\ncuts forming a laminar family of small width. Our main contribution is a new\ndynamic programming approach where the value of a table entry does not only\ndepend on the values of previous table entries, as it is usually the case, but\nalso on a specific representative solution saved together with each table\nentry. This allows for handling a broad range of constraint types.\nIn combination with other techniques -- including negatively correlated\nrounding and a polyhedral approach that, in the problems we consider, allows\nfor avoiding potential losses in the objective through the randomized rounding\n-- we obtain several new results. We first present a quasi-polynomial time\nalgorithm for the Minimum Chain-Constrained Spanning Tree Problem with an\nessentially optimal guarantee. More precisely, each chain constraint is\nviolated by a factor of at most $1+\\varepsilon$, and the cost is no larger than\nthat of an optimal solution not violating any chain constraint. The best\nprevious procedure is a bicriteria approximation violating each chain\nconstraint by up to a constant factor and losing another factor in the\nobjective. Moreover, our approach can naturally handle lower bounds on the\nchain constraints, and it can be extended to constraints on cuts forming a\nlaminar family of constant width.\nFurthermore, we show how our approach can also handle parity constraints (or,\nmore precisely, a proxy thereof) as used in the context of (Path) TSP and one\nof its generalizations, and discuss implications in this context.",

The\nRA scheme with the stability constraints significantly reduces the resource\nutilization and is able to schedule more number of AGVs while maintaining its\nstability. Moreover, the proposed RA scheme is independent of control state and\ndepends upon consecutive packet errors, the control parameters like sampling\ntime and AGV velocity. Furthermore, we also analyse the impact of RA schemes on\nthe AGV's stability and error performance, and evaluated the number of unstable\nAGVs.",

    "abstract": "Virtual Reality headsets enable users to explore the environment by\nperforming self-induced movements. The retinal velocity produced by such motion\nreduces the visual system's ability to resolve fine detail. We measured the\nimpact of self-induced head rotations on the ability to detect quality changes\nof a realistic 3D model in an immersive virtual reality environment. We varied\nthe Level-of-Detail (LOD) as a function of rotational head velocity with\ndifferent degrees of severity. Using a psychophysical method, we asked 17\nparticipants to identify which of the two presented intervals contained the\nhigher quality model under two different maximum velocity conditions. After\nfitting psychometric functions to data relating the percentage of correct\nresponses to the aggressiveness of LOD manipulations, we identified the\nthreshold severity for which participants could reliably (75\\%) detect the\nlower LOD model. Participants accepted an approximately four-fold LOD reduction\neven in the low maximum velocity condition without a significant impact on\nperceived quality, which suggests that there is considerable potential for\noptimisation when users are moving (increased range of perceptual uncertainty).\nMoreover, LOD could be degraded significantly more in the maximum head velocity\ncondition, suggesting these effects are indeed speed dependent.",

    "abstract": "The demise of Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling has revived interest in\nspecialized computer architectures and accelerators. Verification and testing\nof this hardware heavily uses cycle-accurate simulation of\nregister-transfer-level (RTL) designs. The best software RTL simulators can\nsimulate designs at 1--1000~kHz, i.e., more than three orders of magnitude\nslower than hardware. Faster simulation can increase productivity by speeding\ndesign iterations and permitting more exhaustive exploration.\nOne possibility is to use parallelism as RTL exposes considerable fine-grain\nconcurrency. However, state-of-the-art RTL simulators generally perform best\nwhen single-threaded since modern processors cannot effectively exploit\nfine-grain parallelism.\nThis work presents Manticore: a parallel computer designed to accelerate RTL\nsimulation. Manticore uses a static bulk-synchronous parallel (BSP) execution\nmodel to eliminate runtime synchronization barriers among many simple\nprocessors. Manticore relies entirely on its compiler to schedule resources and\ncommunication. Because RTL code is practically free of long divergent execution\npaths, static scheduling is feasible. Communication and synchronization no\nlonger incur runtime overhead, enabling efficient fine-grain parallelism.\nMoreover, static scheduling dramatically simplifies the physical\nimplementation, significantly increasing the potential parallelism on a chip.\nOur 225-core FPGA prototype running at 475 MHz outperforms a state-of-the-art\nRTL simulator on an Intel Xeon processor running at $\\approx$ 3.3 GHz by up to\n27.9$\\times$ (geomean 5.3$\\times$) in nine Verilog benchmarks.",

In\ntransformer decoder, we introduce a temporal self-attention module to enhance\nthe frame level box queries with the temporal relation.

In general, because the rank values directly\ndetermine the model complexity and model accuracy, proper selection of\nlayer-wise rank is very critical and desired. To date, though many low-rank\ncompression approaches, either selecting the ranks in a manual or automatic\nway, have been proposed, they suffer from costly manual trials or unsatisfied\ncompression performance. In addition, all of the existing works are not\ndesigned in a hardware-aware way, limiting the practical performance of the\ncompressed models on real-world hardware platforms.\nTo address these challenges, in this paper we propose HALOC, a hardware-aware\nautomatic low-rank compression framework. By interpreting automatic rank\nselection from an architecture search perspective, we develop an end-to-end\nsolution to determine the suitable layer-wise ranks in a differentiable and\nhardware-aware way. We further propose design principles and mitigation\nstrategy to efficiently explore the rank space and reduce the potential\ninterference problem.\nExperimental results on different datasets and hardware platforms demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our proposed approach.

DTB\nleverages two conditional diffusion modules to progressively refine the desired\noutput with initial image pairs and diffusive generative prior, to obtain a\nbetter generalization ability of deraining and rain generation.

Although stricter regulations, restrictions on heavy manufacturing\nand technological advances are increasing its sustainability, zero-emission and\nfuel-efficient manufacturing is still considered a utopian target. In\nparallel,companies that have invested in digital innovation now need to align\ntheir internal competencies to maximize their return on investment.

However, given the\nspeed with which innovation manifests itself, tools capable of measuring the\nimpact that technology is having on digital and green professions and skills\nare still being designed.

The creation of the Worker Profiler consists of two steps: first, the\nauthors inferred the key technologies and skills for the area of interest,\nisolating those with markedly increasing patent trends and identifying green\nand digital enabling skills and occupations. Thus, the software was designed\nand implemented at the user-interface level. The output of the self-assessment\nis the definition of the missing digital and green skills and the job roles\nclosest to the starting one in terms of current skills; both the results enable\nthe definition of a customized retraining strategy. The tool has shown evidence\nof being user-friendly, effective in identifying skills gaps and easily\nadaptable to other contexts.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised methods in vision have been mostly focused on large\narchitectures as they seem to suffer from a significant performance drop for\nsmaller architectures. In this paper, we propose a simple self-supervised\ndistillation technique that can train high performance low-compute neural\nnetworks. Our main insight is that existing joint-embedding based SSL methods\ncan be repurposed for knowledge distillation from a large self-supervised\nteacher to a small student model. Thus, we call our method Replace one Branch\n(RoB) as it simply replaces one branch of the joint-embedding training with a\nlarge teacher model. RoB is widely applicable to a number of architectures such\nas small ResNets, MobileNets and ViT, and pretrained models such as DINO, SwAV\nor iBOT. When pretraining on the ImageNet dataset, RoB yields models that\ncompete with supervised knowledge distillation. When applied to MSN, RoB\nproduces students with strong semi-supervised capabilities. Finally, our best\nViT-Tiny models improve over prior SSL state-of-the-art on ImageNet by $2.3\\%$\nand are on par or better than a supervised distilled DeiT on five downstream\ntransfer tasks (iNaturalist, CIFAR, Clevr/Count, Clevr/Dist and Places).

A dynamic graph is considered sustainable if its evolution does\nnot result in a static, empty, or periodic graph. To measure the dynamics of\nthe sets of vertices and edges, we propose a metric, named ''Nervousness,''\nwhich is derived from the Jaccard distance.As an illustration of how the\nanalysis can be conducted, we design a parametrized generator, named D3G3\n(Degree-Driven Dynamic Geometric Graphs Generator), which generates dynamic\ngraph instances from an initial geometric graph. The evolution of these\ninstances is driven by two rules that operate on the vertices based on their\ndegree. By varying the parameters of the generator, different properties of the\ndynamic graphs can be produced.Our results show that in order to ascertain the\nsustainability of the generated dynamic graphs, it is necessary to study both\nthe evolution of the order and the Nervousness for a given set of parameters.",

Recently, a few efforts have been made to bring VQA\ntask to aerial images, due to its potential real-world applications in disaster\nmonitoring, urban planning, and digital earth product generation. However, not\nonly the huge variation in the appearance, scale and orientation of the\nconcepts in aerial images, but also the scarcity of the well-annotated datasets\nrestricts the development of VQA in this domain. In this paper, we introduce a\nnew dataset, HRVQA, which provides collected 53512 aerial images of 1024*1024\npixels and semi-automatically generated 1070240 QA pairs. To benchmark the\nunderstanding capability of VQA models for aerial images, we evaluate the\nrelevant methods on HRVQA. Moreover, we propose a novel model, GFTransformer,\nwith gated attention modules and a mutual fusion module. The experiments show\nthat the proposed dataset is quite challenging, especially the specific\nattribute related questions.

In this paper we study the 'streaming sliding window string indexing\nproblem'. Here the string $S$ arrives as a stream, one character at a time, and\nthe goal is to maintain an index of the last $w$ characters, called the\n'window', for a specified parameter $w$. At any point in time a pattern\nmatching query for a pattern $P$ may arrive, also streamed one character at a\ntime, and all occurrences of $P$ within the current window must be returned.\nThe streaming sliding window string indexing problem naturally captures\nscenarios where we want to index the most recent data (i.e. the window) of a\nstream while supporting efficient pattern matching.\nOur main result is a simple $O(w)$ space data structure that uses $O(\\log w)$\ntime with high probability to process each character from both the input string\n$S$ and the pattern string $P$. Reporting each occurrence from $P$ uses\nadditional constant time per reported occurrence. Compared to previous work in\nsimilar scenarios this result is the first to achieve an efficient worst-case\ntime per character from the input stream. We also consider a delayed variant of\nthe problem, where a query may be answered at any point within the next\n$\\delta$ characters that arrive from either stream. We present an $O(w +\n\\delta)$ space data structure for this problem that improves the above time\nbounds to $O(\\log(w/\\delta))$. In particular, for a delay of $\\delta = \\epsilon\nw$ we obtain an $O(w)$ space data structure with constant time processing per\ncharacter.

The design of this methodology allows a user to\nadaptively sample points ad hoc from a discrete training set with no prior\nrequirement of error estimators. It is achieved by exploiting low-fidelity\nmodels throughout the parametric space to sample points using an efficient\nsampling strategy, and at the sampled parametric points, high-fidelity models\nare evaluated to recover the reduced basis functions. The low-fidelity models\nare then adapted with the reduced order models ( ROMs) built by projection onto\nthe subspace spanned by the recovered basis functions. The process continues\nuntil the low-fidelity model can represent the high-fidelity model adequately\nfor all the parameters in the parametric space. Since the proposed methodology\nleverages the use of low-fidelity models to assimilate the solution database,\nit significantly reduces the computational cost in the offline stage.

Intelligent workload distribution\nalgorithms are needed to maximize the utilization of such Fog resources while\nminimizing the time required to process these workloads. These load balancing\nalgorithms are critical in dynamic environments with heterogeneous resources\nand workload requirements along with unpredictable traffic demands. In this\npaper, load balancing is provided using a Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nalgorithm, which optimizes the system performance by minimizing the waiting\ndelay of IoT workloads. Unlike previous studies, the proposed solution does not\nrequire load and resource information from Fog nodes, which makes the algorithm\ndynamically adaptable to possible environment changes over time. This also\nmakes the algorithm aware of the privacy requirements of Fog service providers,\nwho might like to hide such information to prevent competing providers from\ncalculating better pricing strategies. The proposed algorithm is interactively\nevaluated on a Discrete-event Simulator (DES) to mimic a practical deployment\nof the solution in real environments. In addition, we evaluate the algorithm's\ngeneralization ability on simulations longer than what it was trained on,\nwhich, to the best of our knowledge, has never been explored before. The\nresults provided in this paper show how our proposed approach outperforms\nbaseline load balancing methods under different workload generation rates.",

    "title": "Triplet Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Vehicle Re-identification",
    "abstract": "Part feature learning is a critical technology for finegrained semantic\nunderstanding in vehicle re-identification. However, recent unsupervised\nre-identification works exhibit serious gradient collapse issues when directly\nmodeling the part features and global features. To address this problem, in\nthis paper, we propose a novel Triplet Contrastive Learning framework (TCL)\nwhich leverages cluster features to bridge the part features and global\nfeatures. Specifically, TCL devises three memory banks to store the features\naccording to their attributes and proposes a proxy contrastive loss (PCL) to\nmake contrastive learning between adjacent memory banks, thus presenting the\nassociations between the part and global features as a transition of the\npartcluster and cluster-global associations. Since the cluster memory bank\ndeals with all the instance features, it can summarize them into a\ndiscriminative feature representation. To deeply exploit the instance\ninformation, TCL proposes two additional loss functions. For the inter-class\ninstance, a hybrid contrastive loss (HCL) re-defines the sample correlations by\napproaching the positive cluster features and leaving the all negative instance\nfeatures. For the intra-class instances, a weighted regularization cluster\ncontrastive loss (WRCCL) refines the pseudo labels by penalizing the mislabeled\nimages according to the instance similarity. Extensive experiments show that\nTCL outperforms many state-of-the-art unsupervised vehicle re-identification\napproaches. The code will be available at https://github.com/muzishen/TCL.",

    "title": "Rethinking the Expressive Power of GNNs via Graph Biconnectivity",
    "abstract": "Designing expressive Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is a central topic in\nlearning graph-structured data. While numerous approaches have been proposed to\nimprove GNNs in terms of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test, generally there is\nstill a lack of deep understanding of what additional power they can\nsystematically and provably gain. In this paper, we take a fundamentally\ndifferent perspective to study the expressive power of GNNs beyond the WL test.\nSpecifically, we introduce a novel class of expressivity metrics via graph\nbiconnectivity and highlight their importance in both theory and practice. As\nbiconnectivity can be easily calculated using simple algorithms that have\nlinear computational costs, it is natural to expect that popular GNNs can learn\nit easily as well. However, after a thorough review of prior GNN architectures,\nwe surprisingly find that most of them are not expressive for any of these\nmetrics. The only exception is the ESAN framework (Bevilacqua et al., 2022),\nfor which we give a theoretical justification of its power. We proceed to\nintroduce a principled and more efficient approach, called the Generalized\nDistance Weisfeiler-Lehman (GD-WL), which is provably expressive for all\nbiconnectivity metrics. Practically, we show GD-WL can be implemented by a\nTransformer-like architecture that preserves expressiveness and enjoys full\nparallelizability. A set of experiments on both synthetic and real datasets\ndemonstrates that our approach can consistently outperform prior GNN\narchitectures.",

To achieve this goal, we make the following\ncontributions: (i) we start with a naive two-stage approach for open-vocabulary\nobject detection and attribute classification, termed CLIP-Attr.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) allows participants to jointly train a machine\nlearning model without sharing their private data with others. However, FL is\nvulnerable to poisoning attacks such as backdoor attacks. Consequently, a\nvariety of defenses have recently been proposed, which have primarily utilized\nintermediary states of the global model (i.e., logits) or distance of the local\nmodels (i.e., L2-norm) from the global model to detect malicious backdoors.\nHowever, as these approaches directly operate on client updates, their\neffectiveness depends on factors such as clients' data distribution or the\nadversary's attack strategies. In this paper, we introduce a novel and more\ngeneric backdoor defense framework, called BayBFed, which proposes to utilize\nprobability distributions over client updates to detect malicious updates in\nFL: it computes a probabilistic measure over the clients' updates to keep track\nof any adjustments made in the updates, and uses a novel detection algorithm\nthat can leverage this probabilistic measure to efficiently detect and filter\nout malicious updates. Thus, it overcomes the shortcomings of previous\napproaches that arise due to the direct usage of client updates; as our\nprobabilistic measure will include all aspects of the local client training\nstrategies. BayBFed utilizes two Bayesian Non-Parametric extensions: (i) a\nHierarchical Beta-Bernoulli process to draw a probabilistic measure given the\nclients' updates, and (ii) an adaptation of the Chinese Restaurant Process\n(CRP), referred by us as CRP-Jensen, which leverages this probabilistic measure\nto detect and filter out malicious updates. We extensively evaluate our defense\napproach on five benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, Reddit, IoT intrusion detection,\nMNIST, and FMNIST, and show that it can effectively detect and eliminate\nmalicious updates in FL without deteriorating the benign performance of the\nglobal model.",

    "abstract": "The difficulty of an entity matching task depends on a combination of\nmultiple factors such as the amount of corner-case pairs, the fraction of\nentities in the test set that have not been seen during training, and the size\nof the development set. Current entity matching benchmarks usually represent\nsingle points in the space along such dimensions or they provide for the\nevaluation of matching methods along a single dimension, for instance the\namount of training data. This paper presents WDC Products, an entity matching\nbenchmark which provides for the systematic evaluation of matching systems\nalong combinations of three dimensions while relying on real-word data. The\nthree dimensions are (i) amount of corner-cases (ii) generalization to unseen\nentities, and (iii) development set size. Generalization to unseen entities is\na dimension not covered by any of the existing benchmarks yet but is crucial\nfor evaluating the robustness of entity matching systems. WDC Products is based\non heterogeneous product data from thousands of e-shops which mark-up products\noffers using schema.org annotations. Instead of learning how to match entity\npairs, entity matching can also be formulated as a multi-class classification\ntask that requires the matcher to recognize individual entities. WDC Products\nis the first benchmark that provides a pair-wise and a multi-class formulation\nof the same tasks and thus allows to directly compare the two alternatives. We\nevaluate WDC Products using several state-of-the-art matching systems,\nincluding Ditto, HierGAT, and R-SupCon. The evaluation shows that all matching\nsystems struggle with unseen entities to varying degrees. It also shows that\nsome systems are more training data efficient than others.",

Two novel\noptimisation techniques are presented to achieve AOI-SNNs: a regularisation and\na cutoff.

Two crucial,\nsometimes implicit, ingredients for these automated machine learning (AutoML)\nmethods are 1) feature-based representations of the problem instances and 2)\nperformance prediction methods that take the features as input to estimate how\nwell a specific algorithm instance will perform on a given problem instance.\nNon-surprisingly, common machine learning models fail to make predictions for\ninstances whose feature-based representation is underrepresented or not covered\nin the training data, resulting in poor generalization ability of the models\nfor problems not seen during training.In this work, we study\nleave-one-problem-out (LOPO) performance prediction.

    "abstract": "Software quality estimation is a challenging and time-consuming activity, and\nmodels are crucial to face the complexity of such activity on modern software\napplications. In this context, software refactoring is a crucial activity\nwithin development life-cycles where requirements and functionalities rapidly\nevolve. One main challenge is that the improvement of distinctive quality\nattributes may require contrasting refactoring actions on software, as for\ntrade-off between performance and reliability (or other non-functional\nattributes). In such cases, multi-objective optimization can provide the\ndesigner with a wider view on these trade-offs and, consequently, can lead to\nidentify suitable refactoring actions that take into account independent or\neven competing objectives. In this paper, we present an approach that exploits\nNSGA-II as the genetic algorithm to search optimal Pareto frontiers for\nsoftware refactoring while considering many objectives. We consider performance\nand reliability variations of a model alternative with respect to an initial\nmodel, the amount of performance antipatterns detected on the model\nalternative, and the architectural distance, which quantifies the effort to\nobtain a model alternative from the initial one. We applied our approach on two\ncase studies: a Train Ticket Booking Service, and CoCoME. We observed that our\napproach is able to improve performance (by up to 42\\%) while preserving or\neven improving the reliability (by up to 32\\%) of generated model alternatives.\nWe also observed that there exists an order of preference of refactoring\nactions among model alternatives. We can state that performance antipatterns\nconfirmed their ability to improve performance of a subject model in the\ncontext of many-objective optimization. In addition, the metric that we adopted\nfor the architectural distance seems to be suitable for estimating the\nrefactoring effort.",

Our SpArX method first sparsifies the MLP while maintaining\nas much of the original mechanics as possible. It then translates the sparse\nMLP into an equivalent QAF to shed light on the underlying decision process of\nthe MLP, producing global and/or local explanations. We demonstrate\nexperimentally that SpArX can give more faithful explanations than existing\napproaches, while simultaneously providing deeper insights into the actual\nreasoning process of MLPs.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale power-to-hydrogen (P2H) systems formed by multi-stack are\npotentially powerful peak-shaving resources of power systems. However, due to\nthe research gap in connecting the grid-side performance with the inherent\noperation control, the continuous operation of P2H loads is limited by the PF\nassessment under volatile conditions when integrating into the grid. This paper\nfirst fills the gap in proposing the analytical models of active and reactive\npower of P2H loads with a typical power converter interface topology. On this\nbasis, the all-condition PF characteristics of multi-stack P2H loads are\ncaptured as functions of unified current and temperature control variables.\nThen, a PF-constrained multi-timescale control framework is constructed to\nevaluate flexibility, PF, production, and security comprehensively. A two-level\nnexus, including a model-based hour-ahead robust model predictive controller\nand a rule-based real-time increment correction algorithm, is proposed to\nguarantee the control accuracy and tractability. Case studies verify an\nintrinsic control tradeoff between PF and production, resulting in an\nunequal-split allocation strategy compared to the traditional\nproduction-oriented control. The significance of the extended PF and security\ndimensions is verified to improve the flexibility. Furthermore, five typical\noperating modes respectively corresponding to low, medium, and high load levels\nat the cluster level are concluded for industrial application.",

In this paper, we\nintroduce Zorro, a technique that uses masks to control how inputs from each\nmodality are routed inside Transformers, keeping some parts of the\nrepresentation modality-pure. We apply this technique to three popular\ntransformer-based architectures (ViT, Swin and HiP) and show that with\ncontrastive pre-training Zorro achieves state-of-the-art results on most\nrelevant benchmarks for multimodal tasks (AudioSet and VGGSound).

    "title": "Modal Reactors",
    "abstract": "Complex software systems often feature distinct modes of operation, each\ndesigned to handle a particular scenario that may require the system to respond\nin a certain way. Breaking down system behavior into mutually exclusive modes\nand discrete transitions between modes is a commonly used strategy to reduce\nimplementation complexity and promote code readability. However, such\ncapabilities often come in the form of self-contained domain specific languages\nor language-specific frameworks. The work in this paper aims to bring the\nadvantages of modal models to mainstream programming languages, by following\nthe polyglot coordination approach of Lingua Franca (LF), in which verbatim\ntarget code (e.g., C, C++, Python, Typescript, or Rust) is encapsulated in\ncomposable reactive components called reactors. Reactors can form a dataflow\nnetwork, are triggered by timed as well as sporadic events, execute\nconcurrently, and can be distributed across nodes on a network.\nWith modal models in LF, we introduce a lean extension to the concept of\nreactors that enables the coordination of reactive tasks based on modes of\noperation. The implementation of modal reactors outlined in this paper\ngeneralizes to any LF-supported language with only modest modifications to the\ngeneric runtime system.",

The scheme is based on a\nsuitable splitting of the governing PDE into subsystems and employs staggered\ngrids, where the pressure is defined on the primal simplex mesh, while the\nvelocity and the remaining flow quantities are defined on an edge-based\nstaggered dual mesh. The key idea of the scheme is to discretize the nonlinear\nconvective and viscous terms using an explicit FV scheme that employs the\nspace-time divergence form of the governing equations on moving space-time\ncontrol volumes. For the convective terms, an ALE extension of the Ducros flux\non moving meshes is introduced, which is kinetic energy preserving and stable\nin the energy norm when adding suitable numerical dissipation terms. Finally,\nthe pressure equation of the Navier-Stokes system is solved on the new mesh\nconfiguration using a continuous FE method, with $\\mathbb{P}_1$ Lagrange\nelements.\nThe ALE hybrid FV/FE method is applied to several incompressible test\nproblems ranging from non-hydrostatic free surface flows over a rising bubble\nto flows over an oscillating cylinder and an oscillating ellipse. Via the\nsimulation of a circular explosion problem on a moving mesh, we show that the\nscheme applied to the weakly compressible Navier-Stokes equations is able to\ncapture weak shock waves, rarefactions and moving contact discontinuities. We\nshow that our method is particularly efficient for the simulation of weakly\ncompressible flows in the low Mach number limit, compared to a fully explicit\nALE scheme",

These attacks fall\nunder the category of Electronic Warfare (EW), a continuously growing area in\nboth attack and defense of the electromagnetic spectrum, with one subcategory\nbeing electronic attacks. Jamming attacks fall under this specific subcategory\nof EW as they comprise adversarial signals that attempt to disrupt, deny,\ndegrade, destroy, or deceive legitimate signals in the electromagnetic\nspectrum. While jamming is not going away, recent research advances have\nstarted to get the upper hand against these attacks by leveraging new methods\nand techniques, such as machine learning. However, testing such jamming\nsolutions on a wide and realistic scale is a daunting task due to strict\nregulations on spectrum emissions.

This is done by\nintegrating eSWORD into the Colosseum wireless network emulator that enables\nlarge-scale experiments with up to 50 software-defined radio nodes. We compare\nthe performance of eSWORD with that of real-world jamming systems by using an\nover-the-air wireless testbed (ensuring safe measures were taken when\nconducting experiments).

For example, a\nDL test for the diagnosis of microsatellite instability (MSI) in CRC has been\napproved in 2022. Current approaches rely on convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs). Transformer networks are outperforming CNNs and are replacing them in\nmany applications, but have not been used for biomarker prediction in cancer at\na large scale. In addition, most DL approaches have been trained on small\npatient cohorts, which limits their clinical utility. Methods: In this study,\nwe developed a new fully transformer-based pipeline for end-to-end biomarker\nprediction from pathology slides. We combine a pre-trained transformer encoder\nand a transformer network for patch aggregation, capable of yielding single and\nmulti-target prediction at patient level. We train our pipeline on over 9,000\npatients from 10 colorectal cancer cohorts. Results: A fully transformer-based\napproach massively improves the performance, generalizability, data efficiency,\nand interpretability as compared with current state-of-the-art algorithms.\nAfter training on a large multicenter cohort, we achieve a sensitivity of 0.97\nwith a negative predictive value of 0.99 for MSI prediction on surgical\nresection specimens.

Yet it is known that,\noutside the bounds of simple two-player games, convergence cannot be taken for\ngranted.\nTo make progress in resolving this problem, we study the dynamics of smooth\nQ-Learning, a popular reinforcement learning algorithm which quantifies the\ntendency for learning agents to explore their state space or exploit their\npayoffs. We show a sufficient condition on the rate of exploration such that\nthe Q-Learning dynamics is guaranteed to converge to a unique equilibrium in\nany game. We connect this result to games for which Q-Learning is known to\nconverge with arbitrary exploration rates, including weighted Potential games\nand weighted zero sum polymatrix games.\nFinally, we examine the performance of the Q-Learning dynamic as measured by\nthe Time Averaged Social Welfare, and comparing this with the Social Welfare\nachieved by the equilibrium. We provide a sufficient condition whereby the\nQ-Learning dynamic will outperform the equilibrium even if the dynamics do not\nconverge.",

    "abstract": "Due to insufficient or difficult to obtain data on development in\ninaccessible regions, remote sensing data is an important tool for interested\nstakeholders to collect information on economic growth. To date, no studies\nhave utilized deep learning to estimate industrial growth at the level of\nindividual sites. In this study, we harness high-resolution panchromatic\nimagery to estimate development over time at 419 industrial sites in the\nPeople's Republic of China using a multi-tier computer vision framework. We\npresent two methods for approximating development: (1) structural area coverage\nestimated through a Mask R-CNN segmentation algorithm, and (2) imputing\ndevelopment directly with visible & infrared radiance from the Visible Infrared\nImaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). Labels generated from these methods are\ncomparatively evaluated and tested. On a dataset of 2,078 50 cm resolution\nimages spanning 19 years, the results indicate that two dimensions of\nindustrial development can be estimated using high-resolution daytime imagery,\nincluding (a) the total square meters of industrial development (average error\nof 0.021 $\\textrm{km}^2$), and (b) the radiance of lights (average error of 9.8\n$\\mathrm{\\frac{nW}{cm^{2}sr}}$). Trend analysis of the techniques reveal\nestimates from a Mask R-CNN-labeled CNN-LSTM track ground truth measurements\nmost closely. The Mask R-CNN estimates positive growth at every site from the\noldest image to the most recent, with an average change of 4,084\n$\\textrm{m}^2$.",

From a broader test and evaluation context,\ndetermination of difficult tests of system behavior is important as these tests\nwould elucidate problematic system phenomena before these mistakes can engender\nproblematic outcomes, e.g. loss of human life in autonomous cars, costly\nfailures for airplane systems, etc. Our approach builds on existing,\nsimulation-based work in the test and evaluation literature by offering a\ncontroller-agnostic test-synthesis procedure that provides a series of\nbenchmark tests with which to determine controller reliability. To achieve\nthis, our approach codifies the system objective as a timed reach-avoid\nspecification. Then, by coupling control barrier functions with this class of\nspecifications, we construct an instantaneous difficulty metric whose minimizer\ncorresponds to the most difficult test at that system state. We use this\ninstantaneous difficulty metric in a game-theoretic fashion, to produce an\nadversarial, time-varying test-synthesis procedure that does not require\nspecific knowledge of the system's controller, but can still provably identify\nrealizable and maximally difficult tests of system behavior.

    "abstract": "Most Transformer language models are primarily pretrained on English text,\nlimiting their use for other languages. As the model sizes grow, the\nperformance gap between English and other languages with fewer compute and data\nresources increases even further. Consequently, more resource-efficient\ntraining methods are needed to bridge the gap for languages with fewer\nresources available. To address this problem, we introduce a cross-lingual and\nprogressive transfer learning approach, called CLP-Transfer, that transfers\nmodels from a source language, for which pretrained models are publicly\navailable, like English, to a new target language. As opposed to prior work,\nwhich focused on the cross-lingual transfer between two languages, we extend\nthe transfer to the model size. Given a pretrained model in a source language,\nwe aim for a same-sized model in a target language. Instead of training a model\nfrom scratch, we exploit a smaller model that is in the target language but\nrequires much fewer resources. Both small and source models are then used to\ninitialize the token embeddings of the larger model based on the overlapping\nvocabulary of the source and target language. All remaining weights are reused\nfrom the model in the source language. This approach outperforms the sole\ncross-lingual transfer and can save up to 80% of the training steps compared to\nthe random initialization.",

Previous\napproaches for this task relied on human input to explicitly specify goal\nstate, or synthesized scenes from scratch -- but such methods do not address\nthe rearrangement of existing messy scenes without providing a goal state. In\nthis paper, we present LEGO-Net, a data-driven transformer-based iterative\nmethod for learning regular rearrangement of objects in messy rooms. LEGO-Net\nis partly inspired by diffusion models -- it starts with an initial messy state\nand iteratively \"de-noises'' the position and orientation of objects to a\nregular state while reducing the distance traveled. Given randomly perturbed\nobject positions and orientations in an existing dataset of\nprofessionally-arranged scenes, our method is trained to recover a regular\nre-arrangement.

A HexPlane computes features for points in spacetime by fusing\nvectors extracted from each plane, which is highly efficient. Pairing a\nHexPlane with a tiny MLP to regress output colors and training via volume\nrendering gives impressive results for novel view synthesis on dynamic scenes,\nmatching the image quality of prior work but reducing training time by more\nthan $100\\times$.

This process of awareness experiences causation\nwhich underpins the notion of time while it interplays with matter and energy,\nforming reality. The study of Consciousness, time and reality is complex and\nevolving fast in many fields, including metaphysics and fundamental physics.\nReality composes patterns in human Consciousness in response to the\nregularities in nature. These regularities could be physical (e.g.,\nastronomical, environmental), biological, chemical, mental, social, etc. The\npatterns that emerged in Consciousness were correlated to the environment, life\nand social behaviours followed by constructed frameworks, systems and\nstructures. The complex constructs evolved as cultures, customs, norms and\nvalues, which created a diverse society.

Under mild assumptions, the treatment effect of interest\ncan be identified. We extend the approach to address censored outcome data. The\nproposed method is applied to a neoadjuvant clinical trial and its performance\nis evaluated via simulation studies.\nIn the second project, we propose a tree-based model averaging approach to\nimprove the estimation accuracy of conditional average treatment effects at a\ntarget site by leveraging models derived from other potentially heterogeneous\nsites, without them sharing subject-level data. The performance of this\napproach is demonstrated by a study of the causal effects of oxygen therapy on\nhospital survival rates and backed up by comprehensive simulations.\nIn the third project, we propose a robust individualized decision learning\nframework with sensitive variables to improve the worst-case outcomes of\nindividuals caused by sensitive variables that are unavailable at the time of\ndecision. Unlike most existing work that uses mean-optimal objectives, we\npropose a robust learning framework by finding a newly defined quantile- or\ninfimum-optimal decision rule.

    "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) imaging is a widely used modality for early lung\ncancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Features extracted from CT images\nare now accepted to quantify spatial and temporal variations in tumor\narchitecture and function. However, CT images are often acquired using scanners\nfrom different vendors with customized acquisition standards, resulting in\nsignificantly different texture features even for the same patient, posing a\nfundamental challenge to downstream studies. Existing CT image harmonization\nmodels rely on supervised or semi-supervised techniques, with limited\nperformance. In this paper, we have proposed a diffusion-based CT image\nstandardization model called DiffusionCT which works on latent space by mapping\nlatent distribution into a standard distribution. DiffusionCT incorporates an\nUnet-based encoder-decoder and a diffusion model embedded in its bottleneck\npart. The Unet first trained without the diffusion model to learn the latent\nrepresentation of the input data. The diffusion model is trained in the next\ntraining phase. All the trained models work together on image standardization.\nThe encoded representation outputted from the Unet encoder passes through the\ndiffusion model, and the diffusion model maps the distribution in to target\nstandard image domain. Finally, the decode takes that transformed latent\nrepresentation to synthesize a standardized image. The experimental results\nshow that DiffusionCT significantly improves the performance of the\nstandardization task.",

    "abstract": "As convolutional neural networks (CNN) become the most successful\nreconstruction technique for accelerated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), CNN\nreaches its limit on image quality especially in sharpness. Further improvement\non image quality often comes at massive computational costs, hindering their\npracticability in the clinic setting. MRI reconstruction is essentially a\ndeconvolution problem, which demands long-distance information that is\ndifficult to be captured by CNNs with small convolution kernels. The\nmulti-layer perceptron (MLP) is able to model such long-distance information,\nbut it restricts a fixed input size while the reconstruction of images in\nflexible resolutions is required in the clinic setting. In this paper, we\nproposed a hybrid CNN and MLP reconstruction strategy, featured by dynamic MLP\n(dMLP) that accepts arbitrary image sizes. Experiments were conducted using 3D\nmulti-coil MRI. Our results suggested the proposed dMLP can improve image\nsharpness compared to its pure CNN counterpart, while costing minor additional\nGPU memory and computation time. We further compared the proposed dMLP with\nCNNs using large kernels and studied pure MLP-based reconstruction using a\nstack of 1D dMLPs, as well as its CNN counterpart using only 1D convolutions.\nWe observed the enlarged receptive field has noticeably improved image quality,\nwhile simply using CNN with a large kernel leads to difficulties in training.\nNoticeably, the pure MLP-based method has been outperformed by CNN-involved\nmethods, which matches the observations in other computer vision tasks for\nnatural images.",

    "abstract": "Annotating medical images for disease detection is often tedious and\nexpensive. Moreover, the available training samples for a given task are\ngenerally scarce and imbalanced. These conditions are not conducive for\nlearning effective deep neural models. Hence, it is common to 'transfer' neural\nnetworks trained on natural images to the medical image domain. However, this\nparadigm lacks in performance due to the large domain gap between the natural\nand medical image data. To address that, we propose a novel concept of Pre-text\nRepresentation Transfer (PRT). In contrast to the conventional transfer\nlearning, which fine-tunes a source model after replacing its classification\nlayers, PRT retains the original classification layers and updates the\nrepresentation layers through an unsupervised pre-text task. The task is\nperformed with (original, not synthetic) medical images, without utilizing any\nannotations. This enables representation transfer with a large amount of\ntraining data. This high-fidelity representation transfer allows us to use the\nresulting model as a more effective feature extractor. Moreover, we can also\nsubsequently perform the traditional transfer learning with this model. We\ndevise a collaborative representation based classification layer for the case\nwhen we leverage the model as a feature extractor. We fuse the output of this\nlayer with the predictions of a model induced with the traditional transfer\nlearning performed over our pre-text transferred model. The utility of our\ntechnique for limited and imbalanced data classification problem is\ndemonstrated with an extensive five-fold evaluation for three large-scale\nmodels, tested for five different class-imbalance ratios for CT based COVID-19\ndetection. Our results show a consistent gain over the conventional transfer\nlearning with the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in probabilistic generative modeling have motivated learning\nStructural Causal Models (SCM) from observational datasets using deep\nconditional generative models, also known as Deep Structural Causal Models\n(DSCM). If successful, DSCMs can be utilized for causal estimation tasks, e.g.,\nfor answering counterfactual queries. In this work, we warn practitioners about\nnon-identifiability of counterfactual inference from observational data, even\nin the absence of unobserved confounding and assuming known causal structure.\nWe prove counterfactual identifiability of monotonic generation mechanisms with\nsingle dimensional exogenous variables. For general generation mechanisms with\nmulti-dimensional exogenous variables, we provide an impossibility result for\ncounterfactual identifiability, motivating the need for parametric assumptions.\nAs a practical approach, we propose a method for estimating worst-case errors\nof learned DSCMs' counterfactual predictions. The size of this error can be an\nessential metric for deciding whether or not DSCMs are a viable approach for\ncounterfactual inference in a specific problem setting. In evaluation, our\nmethod confirms negligible counterfactual errors for an identifiable SCM from\nprior work, and also provides informative error bounds on counterfactual errors\nfor a non-identifiable synthetic SCM.",

    "abstract": "Recently, researchers have utilized neural network-based speaker embedding\ntechniques in speaker-recognition tasks to identify speakers accurately.\nHowever, speaker-discriminative embeddings do not always represent speech\nfeatures such as age group well. In an embedding model that has been highly\ntrained to capture speaker traits, the task of age group classification is\ncloser to speech information leakage. Hence, to improve age group\nclassification performance, we consider the use of speaker-discriminative\nembeddings derived from adversarial multi-task learning to align features and\nreduce the domain discrepancy in age subgroups. In addition, we investigated\ndifferent types of speaker embeddings to learn and generalize the\ndomain-invariant representations for age groups.

This leads to explainable AI (XAI) manifesting itself\nas an important research field that helps humans to better comprehend ML\nsystems. In parallel, quantum machine learning (QML) is emerging with the\nongoing improvement of quantum computing hardware combined with its increasing\navailability via cloud services. QML enables quantum-enhanced ML in which\nquantum mechanics is exploited to facilitate ML tasks, typically in form of\nquantum-classical hybrid algorithms that combine quantum and classical\nresources. Quantum gates constitute the building blocks of gate-based quantum\nhardware and form circuits that can be used for quantum computations. For QML\napplications, quantum circuits are typically parameterized and their parameters\nare optimized classically such that a suitably defined objective function is\nminimized. Inspired by XAI, we raise the question of explainability of such\ncircuits by quantifying the importance of (groups of) gates for specific goals.\nTo this end, we transfer and adapt the well-established concept of Shapley\nvalues to the quantum realm. The resulting attributions can be interpreted as\nexplanations for why a specific circuit works well for a given task, improving\nthe understanding of how to construct parameterized (or variational) quantum\ncircuits, and fostering their human interpretability in general.

    "abstract": "We study a normalizing flow in the latent space of a top-down generator\nmodel, in which the normalizing flow model plays the role of the informative\nprior model of the generator. We propose to jointly learn the latent space\nnormalizing flow prior model and the top-down generator model by a Markov chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC)-based maximum likelihood algorithm, where a short-run\nLangevin sampling from the intractable posterior distribution is performed to\ninfer the latent variables for each observed example, so that the parameters of\nthe normalizing flow prior and the generator can be updated with the inferred\nlatent variables. We show that, under the scenario of non-convergent short-run\nMCMC, the finite step Langevin dynamics is a flow-like approximate inference\nmodel and the learning objective actually follows the perturbation of the\nmaximum likelihood estimation (MLE). We further point out that the learning\nframework seeks to (i) match the latent space normalizing flow and the\naggregated posterior produced by the short-run Langevin flow, and (ii) bias the\nmodel from MLE such that the short-run Langevin flow inference is close to the\ntrue posterior. Empirical results of extensive experiments validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed latent space normalizing flow model in the tasks\nof image generation, image reconstruction, anomaly detection, supervised image\ninpainting and unsupervised image recovery.",

    "abstract": "The variation in histologic staining between different medical centers is one\nof the most profound challenges in the field of computer-aided diagnosis. The\nappearance disparity of pathological whole slide images causes algorithms to\nbecome less reliable, which in turn impedes the wide-spread applicability of\ndownstream tasks like cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, different stainings lead\nto biases in the training which in case of domain shifts negatively affect the\ntest performance. Therefore, in this paper we propose MultiStain-CycleGAN, a\nmulti-domain approach to stain normalization based on CycleGAN. Our\nmodifications to CycleGAN allow us to normalize images of different origins\nwithout retraining or using different models. We perform an extensive\nevaluation of our method using various metrics and compare it to commonly used\nmethods that are multi-domain capable. First, we evaluate how well our method\nfools a domain classifier that tries to assign a medical center to an image.\nThen, we test our normalization on the tumor classification performance of a\ndownstream classifier. Furthermore, we evaluate the image quality of the\nnormalized images using the Structural similarity index and the ability to\nreduce the domain shift using the Fr\\'echet inception distance. We show that\nour method proves to be multi-domain capable, provides the highest image\nquality among the compared methods, and can most reliably fool the domain\nclassifier while keeping the tumor classifier performance high. By reducing the\ndomain influence, biases in the data can be removed on the one hand and the\norigin of the whole slide image can be disguised on the other, thus enhancing\npatient data privacy.",

    "title": "A New Approach to Learning Linear Dynamical Systems",
    "abstract": "Linear dynamical systems are the foundational statistical model upon which\ncontrol theory is built. Both the celebrated Kalman filter and the linear\nquadratic regulator require knowledge of the system dynamics to provide\nanalytic guarantees. Naturally, learning the dynamics of a linear dynamical\nsystem from linear measurements has been intensively studied since Rudolph\nKalman's pioneering work in the 1960's. Towards these ends, we provide the\nfirst polynomial time algorithm for learning a linear dynamical system from a\npolynomial length trajectory up to polynomial error in the system parameters\nunder essentially minimal assumptions: observability, controllability, and\nmarginal stability. Our algorithm is built on a method of moments estimator to\ndirectly estimate Markov parameters from which the dynamics can be extracted.\nFurthermore, we provide statistical lower bounds when our observability and\ncontrollability assumptions are violated.",

To address some of these issues,\nwe present Deep Fastfood Ensembles - a simple, fast and yet effective method\nfor combining deep features pooled from popular CNN models pre-trained on\ntotally different source domains (e.g., natural image objects) and projected\nonto diverse dimensions using random projections, the so-called Fastfood [11].\nThe final ensemble output is obtained by a consensus of simple individual\nclassifiers, each of which is trained on a different collection of random basis\nvectors. This offers extremely fast and yet effective solution, especially when\ntraining times and domain labels are of the essence. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed deep fastfood ensemble learning as compared to\nthe state-of-the-art methods for three different tasks in histopathology image\nanalysis.",

This result generalizes previous ones\nof Farrell (2011) and Magsino, Mixon, and Parshall (2021). We also derive an\nexplicit recursion for the difference between the empirical moments\n$\\frac{1}{N}\\mathrm{Tr}((\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{A})^k)$ and the limiting\nMANOVA moments, and use this to prove a sufficient condition for convergence in\nprobability of the largest eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{A}$ to\nthe right edge of the support of the limiting law in the special case where\nthat law belongs to the Kesten-McKay family.

In this article, we present a\nrelatively new mathematical framework that provides the beginning of a deeper\nunderstanding of deep learning.

The\nkey mathematical tools which support this framework include transform-domain\nsparse regularization, the Radon transform of computed tomography, and\napproximation theory, which are all techniques deeply rooted in signal\nprocessing. This framework explains the effect of weight decay regularization\nin neural network training, the use of skip connections and low-rank weight\nmatrices in network architectures, the role of sparsity in neural networks, and\nexplains why neural networks can perform well in high-dimensional problems.",

This outperformance was statistically\nsignificant versus ten of the twelve other brain regions (not significant\nversus adjacent Left Frontal and Right Frontal regions).

In this\nwork, we explore a novel strategy based on kernelized Maximum Mean Discrepancy\n(MMD) analysis for determination of pairwise similarity between WSIs. The\nproposed approach works by calculating MMD between two WSIs using kernels over\ndeep features of image patches.
