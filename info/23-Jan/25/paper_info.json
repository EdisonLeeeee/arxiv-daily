    "abstract": "Zero-Shot Relation Extraction (ZRE) is the task of Relation Extraction where\nthe training and test sets have no shared relation types. This very challenging\ndomain is a good test of a model's ability to generalize. Previous approaches\nto ZRE reframed relation extraction as Question Answering (QA), allowing for\nthe use of pre-trained QA models. However, this method required manually\ncreating gold question templates for each new relation. Here, we do away with\nthese gold templates and instead learn a model that can generate questions for\nunseen relations. Our technique can successfully translate relation\ndescriptions into relevant questions, which are then leveraged to generate the\ncorrect tail entity. On tail entity extraction, we outperform the previous\nstate-of-the-art by more than 16 F1 points without using gold question\ntemplates. On the RE-QA dataset where no previous baseline for relation\nextraction exists, our proposed algorithm comes within 0.7 F1 points of a\nsystem that uses gold question templates. Our model also outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art ZRE baselines on the FewRel and WikiZSL datasets, showing that\nQA models no longer need template questions to match the performance of models\nspecifically tailored to the ZRE task.

    "title": "Selective Explanations: Leveraging Human Input to Align Explainable AI",
    "abstract": "While a vast collection of explainable AI (XAI) algorithms have been\ndeveloped in recent years, they are often criticized for significant gaps with\nhow humans produce and consume explanations. As a result, current XAI\ntechniques are often found to be hard to use and lack effectiveness. In this\nwork, we attempt to close these gaps by making AI explanations selective -- a\nfundamental property of human explanations -- by selectively presenting a\nsubset from a large set of model reasons based on what aligns with the\nrecipient's preferences. We propose a general framework for generating\nselective explanations by leveraging human input on a small sample. This\nframework opens up a rich design space that accounts for different selectivity\ngoals, types of input, and more. As a showcase, we use a decision-support task\nto explore selective explanations based on what the decision-maker would\nconsider relevant to the decision task. We conducted two experimental studies\nto examine three out of a broader possible set of paradigms based on our\nproposed framework: in Study 1, we ask the participants to provide their own\ninput to generate selective explanations, with either open-ended or\ncritique-based input. In Study 2, we show participants selective explanations\nbased on input from a panel of similar users (annotators). Our experiments\ndemonstrate the promise of selective explanations in reducing over-reliance on\nAI and improving decision outcomes and subjective perceptions of the AI, but\nalso paint a nuanced picture that attributes some of these positive effects to\nthe opportunity to provide one's own input to augment AI explanations. Overall,\nour work proposes a novel XAI framework inspired by human communication\nbehaviors and demonstrates its potentials to encourage future work to better\nalign AI explanations with human production and consumption of explanations.",

    "abstract": "Object recognition systems are usually trained and evaluated on high\nresolution images. However, in real world applications, it is common that the\nimages have low resolutions or have small sizes. In this study, we first track\nthe performance of the state-of-the-art deep object recognition network,\nFaster- RCNN, as a function of image resolution. The results reveals negative\neffects of low resolution images on recognition performance. They also show\nthat different spatial frequencies convey different information about the\nobjects in recognition process. It means multi-resolution recognition system\ncan provides better insight into optimal selection of features that results in\nbetter recognition of objects. This is similar to the mechanisms of the human\nvisual systems that are able to implement multi-scale representation of a\nvisual scene simultaneously. Then, we propose a multi-resolution object\nrecognition framework rather than a single-resolution network. The proposed\nframework is evaluated on the PASCAL VOC2007 database. The experimental results\nshow the performance of our adapted multi-resolution Faster-RCNN framework\noutperforms the single-resolution Faster-RCNN on input images with various\nresolutions with an increase in the mean Average Precision (mAP) of 9.14%\nacross all resolutions and 1.2% on the full-spectrum images.

    "abstract": "Resource disaggregation offers a cost effective solution to resource scaling,\nutilization, and failure-handling in data centers by physically separating\nhardware devices in a server. Servers are architected as pools of processor,\nmemory, and storage devices, organized as independent failure-isolated\ncomponents interconnected by a high-bandwidth network. A critical challenge,\nhowever, is the high performance penalty of accessing data from a remote memory\nmodule over the network. Addressing this challenge is difficult as\ndisaggregated systems have high runtime variability in network\nlatencies/bandwidth, and page migration can significantly delay critical path\ncache line accesses in other pages. This paper introduces DaeMon, the first\nsoftware-transparent and robust mechanism to significantly alleviate data\nmovement overheads in fully disaggregated systems. First, to enable scalability\nto multiple hardware components in the system, we enhance each compute and\nmemory unit with specialized engines that transparently handle data migrations.\nSecond, to achieve high performance and provide robustness across various\nnetwork, architecture and application characteristics, we implement a\nsynergistic approach of bandwidth partitioning, link compression, decoupled\ndata movement of multiple granularities, and adaptive granularity selection in\ndata movements. We evaluate DaeMon in a wide variety of workloads at different\nnetwork and architecture configurations using a state-of-the-art accurate\nsimulator and demonstrate that DaeMon significantly improves system performance\nand data access costs over the widely-adopted approach of moving data at page\ngranularity.",

The ECM loss is simple, theoretically well-motivated,\nand outperforms other heuristic counterparts on LVIS v1 benchmark over a wide\nrange of architecture and detectors.

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel approach for combining first-stage lexical\nretrieval models and Transformer-based re-rankers: we inject the relevance\nscore of the lexical model as a token in the middle of the input of the\ncross-encoder re-ranker. It was shown in prior work that interpolation between\nthe relevance score of lexical and BERT-based re-rankers may not consistently\nresult in higher effectiveness. Our idea is motivated by the finding that BERT\nmodels can capture numeric information. We compare several representations of\nthe BM25 score and inject them as text in the input of four different\ncross-encoders. We additionally analyze the effect for different query types,\nand investigate the effectiveness of our method for capturing exact matching\nrelevance. Evaluation on the MSMARCO Passage collection and the TREC DL\ncollections shows that the proposed method significantly improves over all\ncross-encoder re-rankers as well as the common interpolation methods. We show\nthat the improvement is consistent for all query types. We also find an\nimprovement in exact matching capabilities over both BM25 and the\ncross-encoders. Our findings indicate that cross-encoder re-rankers can\nefficiently be improved without additional computational burden and extra steps\nin the pipeline by explicitly adding the output of the first-stage ranker to\nthe model input, and this effect is robust for different models and query\ntypes.",

    "abstract": "Discrimination of hand gestures based on the decoding of surface\nelectromyography (sEMG) signals is a well-establish approach for controlling\nprosthetic devices and for Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI). However, despite the\npromising results achieved by this approach in well-controlled experimental\nconditions, its deployment in long-term real-world application scenarios is\nstill hindered by several challenges. One of the most critical challenges is\nmaintaining high EMG data classification performance across multiple days\nwithout retraining the decoding system. The drop in performance is mostly due\nto the high EMG variability caused by electrodes shift, muscle artifacts,\nfatigue, user adaptation, or skin-electrode interfacing issues. Here we propose\na novel statistical method based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) that\nstabilizes EMG classification performance across multiple days for long-term\ncontrol of prosthetic devices. We show how CCA can dramatically decrease the\nperformance drop of standard classifiers observed across days, by maximizing\nthe correlation among multiple-day acquisition data sets. Our results show how\nthe performance of a classifier trained on EMG data acquired only of the first\nday of the experiment maintains 90% relative accuracy across multiple days,\ncompensating for the EMG data variability that occurs over long-term periods,\nusing the CCA transformation on data obtained from a small number of gestures.\nThis approach eliminates the need for large data sets and multiple or periodic\ntraining sessions, which currently hamper the usability of conventional pattern\nrecognition based approaches",

    "abstract": "Industrial Internet of Things (I-IoT) is a collaboration of devices, sensors,\nand networking equipment to monitor and collect data from industrial\noperations. Machine learning (ML) methods use this data to make high-level\ndecisions with minimal human intervention. Data-driven predictive maintenance\n(PDM) is a crucial ML-based I-IoT application to find an optimal maintenance\nschedule for industrial assets. The performance of these ML methods can\nseriously be threatened by adversarial attacks where an adversary crafts\nperturbed data and sends it to the ML model to deteriorate its prediction\nperformance. The models should be able to stay robust against these attacks\nwhere robustness is measured by how much perturbation in input data affects\nmodel performance. Hence, there is a need for effective defense mechanisms that\ncan protect these models against adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose\na double defense mechanism to detect and mitigate adversarial attacks in I-IoT\nenvironments. We first detect if there is an adversarial attack on a given\nsample using novelty detection algorithms. Then, based on the outcome of our\nalgorithm, marking an instance as attack or normal, we select adversarial\nretraining or standard training to provide a secondary defense layer. If there\nis an attack, adversarial retraining provides a more robust model, while we\napply standard training for regular samples. Since we may not know if an attack\nwill take place, our adaptive mechanism allows us to consider irregular changes\nin data. The results show that our double defense strategy is highly efficient\nwhere we can improve model robustness by up to 64.6% and 52% compared to\nstandard and adversarial retraining, respectively.",

Further,\ntraining with this constraint requires a similar number of samples as its\nunconstrained counterpart to master the skill. These findings shed light on how\nsimple constraints can help robots achieve sensible and safe behavior quickly\nand ease concerns surrounding hardware deployment. We also investigate the\neffects of the strictness of these constraints and report findings that provide\ninsights into how different degrees of strictness affect learning outcomes.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a new perspective is suggested for unsupervised Ontology\nMatching (OM) or Ontology Alignment (OA) by treating it as a translation task.\nOntologies are represented as graphs, and the translation is performed from a\nnode in the source ontology graph to a path in the target ontology graph. The\nproposed framework, Truveta Mapper (TM), leverages a multi-task\nsequence-to-sequence transformer model to perform alignment across multiple\nontologies in a zero-shot, unified and end-to-end manner. Multi-tasking enables\nthe model to implicitly learn the relationship between different ontologies via\ntransfer-learning without requiring any explicit cross-ontology manually\nlabeled data. This also enables the formulated framework to outperform existing\nsolutions for both runtime latency and alignment quality. The model is\npre-trained and fine-tuned only on publicly available text corpus and\ninner-ontologies data. The proposed solution outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches, Edit-Similarity, LogMap, AML, BERTMap, and the recently presented\nnew OM frameworks in Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI22), offers\nlog-linear complexity in contrast to quadratic in the existing end-to-end\nmethods, and overall makes the OM task efficient and more straightforward\nwithout much post-processing involving mapping extension or mapping repair.",

    "abstract": "Large Transformer-based Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) dominate almost all\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Nevertheless, they still make mistakes\nfrom time to time. For a model deployed in an industrial environment, fixing\nthese mistakes quickly and robustly is vital to improve user experiences.\nPrevious works formalize such problems as Model Editing (ME) and mostly focus\non fixing one mistake. However, the one-mistake-fixing scenario is not an\naccurate abstraction of the real-world challenge. In the deployment of AI\nservices, there are ever-emerging mistakes, and the same mistake may recur if\nnot corrected in time. Thus a preferable solution is to rectify the mistakes as\nsoon as they appear nonstop. Therefore, we extend the existing ME into\nSequential Model Editing (SME) to help develop more practical editing methods.\nOur study shows that most current ME methods could yield unsatisfying results\nin this scenario. We then introduce Transformer-Patcher, a novel model editor\nthat can shift the behavior of transformer-based models by simply adding and\ntraining a few neurons in the last Feed-Forward Network layer. Experimental\nresults on both classification and generation tasks show that\nTransformer-Patcher can successively correct up to thousands of errors\n(Reliability) and generalize to their equivalent inputs (Generality) while\nretaining the model's accuracy on irrelevant inputs (Locality).

In\nmany countries, legislation to make manufacturers responsible for taking\ne-waste at the end of their useful lives either has been adopted or is being\nconsidered. In this paper, by capturing different stages in the life-cycle of\nEOL electronic products (or, e-waste) generated from private or small-entity\nusers, we develop two different formulations of a reverse logistics network,\ni.e. system-optimum model and user-optimum model, to estimate both economic and\nenvironmental effects of take-back legislation.

While we study\nthe whole reverse logistics network associated with recycling and\nremanufacturing of e-waste in the system-optimum model and obtain an optimum\nsolution from the policy maker's perspective, we split the logistics network\ninto two distinct parts in the user-optimum model in order to derive an optimum\nsolution from the users' standpoint.

Implicitness minimizes interruption while\nnaturalness reduces cognitive demand, and they together improve responsiveness\nto robots. We introduce a novel process for such Team status Projection via\nvirtual Shadows, or TPS. We compare our method with two baselines that use\nexplicit projection for maintaining TSA. Results via human factors studies\ndemonstrate that TPS provides a more fluent human-robot interaction experience\nby significantly improving human responsiveness to robots in tacit teaming\nscenarios, which suggests better TSA.

    "abstract": "Data scarcity hinders the usability of data-dependent algorithms when\ntackling IoT intrusion detection (IID). To address this, we utilise the data\nrich network intrusion detection (NID) domain to facilitate more accurate\nintrusion detection for IID domains. In this paper, a Geometric Graph Alignment\n(GGA) approach is leveraged to mask the geometric heterogeneities between\ndomains for better intrusion knowledge transfer. Specifically, each intrusion\ndomain is formulated as a graph where vertices and edges represent intrusion\ncategories and category-wise interrelationships, respectively. The overall\nshape is preserved via a confused discriminator incapable to identify adjacency\nmatrices between different intrusion domain graphs. A rotation avoidance\nmechanism and a centre point matching mechanism is used to avoid graph\nmisalignment due to rotation and symmetry, respectively. Besides, category-wise\nsemantic knowledge is transferred to act as vertex-level alignment. To exploit\nthe target data, a pseudo-label election mechanism that jointly considers\nnetwork prediction, geometric property and neighbourhood information is used to\nproduce fine-grained pseudo-label assignment. Upon aligning the intrusion\ngraphs geometrically from different granularities, the transferred intrusion\nknowledge can boost IID performance. Comprehensive experiments on several\nintrusion datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the GGA approach\nand validate the usefulness of GGA constituting components.",

    "abstract": "A constrained version of the online convex optimization (OCO) problem is\nconsidered. With slotted time, for each slot, first an action is chosen.\nSubsequently the loss function and the constraint violation penalty evaluated\nat the chosen action point is revealed. For each slot, both the loss function\nas well as the function defining the constraint set is assumed to be smooth and\nstrongly convex. In addition, once an action is chosen, local information about\na feasible set within a small neighborhood of the current action is also\nrevealed. An algorithm is allowed to compute at most one gradient at its point\nof choice given the described feedback to choose the next action. The goal of\nan algorithm is to simultaneously minimize the dynamic regret (loss incurred\ncompared to the oracle's loss) and the constraint violation penalty (penalty\naccrued compared to the oracle's penalty). We propose an algorithm that follows\nprojected gradient descent over a suitably chosen set around the current\naction. We show that both the dynamic regret and the constraint violation is\norder-wise bounded by the {\\it path-length}, the sum of the distances between\nthe consecutive optimal actions. Moreover, we show that the derived bounds are\nthe best possible.",

    "abstract": "Semantic parsing plays a key role in digital voice assistants such as Alexa,\nSiri, and Google Assistant by mapping natural language to structured meaning\nrepresentations. When we want to improve the capabilities of a voice assistant\nby adding a new domain, the underlying semantic parsing model needs to be\nretrained using thousands of annotated examples from the new domain, which is\ntime-consuming and expensive. In this work, we present an architecture to\nperform such domain adaptation automatically, with only a small amount of\nmetadata about the new domain and without any new training data (zero-shot) or\nwith very few examples (few-shot). We use a base seq2seq (sequence-to-sequence)\narchitecture and augment it with a concept encoder that encodes intent and slot\ntags from the new domain. We also introduce a novel decoder-focused approach to\npretrain seq2seq models to be concept aware using Wikidata and use it to help\nour model learn important concepts and perform well in low-resource settings.\nWe report few-shot and zero-shot results for compositional semantic parsing on\nthe TOPv2 dataset and show that our model outperforms prior approaches in\nfew-shot settings for the TOPv2 and SNIPS datasets.",

    "abstract": "We consider the allocation of $m$ balls (jobs) into $n$ bins (servers). In\nthe standard Two-Choice process, at each step $t=1,2,\\ldots,m$ we first sample\ntwo bins uniformly at random and place a ball in the least loaded bin. It is\nwell-known that for any $m \\geq n$, this results in a gap (difference between\nthe maximum and average load) of $\\log_2 \\log n + \\Theta(1)$ (with high\nprobability). In this work, we consider the Memory process [Mitzenmacher,\nPrabhakar and Shah 2002] where instead of two choices, we only sample one bin\nper step but we have access to a cache which can store the location of one bin.\nMitzenmacher, Prabhakar and Shah showed that in the lightly loaded case ($m =\nn$), the Memory process achieves a gap of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log \\log n)$.\nExtending the setting of Mitzenmacher et al. in two ways, we first allow the\nnumber of balls $m$ to be arbitrary, which includes the challenging heavily\nloaded case where $m \\geq n$. Secondly, we follow the heterogeneous bins model\nof Wieder [Wieder 2007], where the sampling distribution of bins can be biased\nup to some arbitrary multiplicative constant. Somewhat surprisingly, we prove\nthat even in this setting, the Memory process still achieves an\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log \\log n)$ gap bound. This is in stark contrast with the\nTwo-Choice (or any $d$-Choice with $d=\\mathcal{O}(1)$) process, where it is\nknown that the gap diverges as $m \\rightarrow \\infty$ [Wieder 2007]. Further,\nwe show that for any sampling distribution independent of $m$ (but possibly\ndependent on $n$) the Memory process has a gap that can be bounded\nindependently of $m$. Finally, we prove a tight gap bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log\nn)$ for Memory in another relaxed setting with heterogeneous (weighted) balls\nand a cache which can only be maintained for two steps.",

    "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are becoming increasingly popular as they\ncan process a wide variety of data formats that prior deep neural networks\ncannot easily support. One key challenge in designing hardware accelerators for\nGCNs is the vast size and randomness in their data access patterns which\ngreatly reduces the effectiveness of the limited on-chip cache. Aimed at\nimproving the effectiveness of the cache by mitigating the irregular data\naccesses, prior studies often employ the vertex tiling techniques used in\ntraditional graph processing applications. While being effective at enhancing\nthe cache efficiency, those approaches are often sensitive to the tiling\nconfigurations where the optimal setting heavily depends on target input\ndatasets. Furthermore, the existing solutions require manual tuning through\ntrial-and-error or rely on sub-optimal analytical models.\nIn this paper, we propose Slice-and-Forge (SnF), an efficient hardware\naccelerator for GCNs which greatly improves the effectiveness of the limited\non-chip cache. SnF chooses a tiling strategy named feature slicing that splits\nthe features into vertical slices and processes them in the outermost loop of\nthe execution. This particular choice results in a repetition of the identical\ncomputational patterns over irregular graph data over multiple rounds. Taking\nadvantage of such repetitions, SnF dynamically tunes its tile size. Our\nexperimental results reveal that SnF can achieve 1.73x higher performance in\ngeomean compared to prior work on multi-engine settings, and 1.46x higher\nperformance in geomean on small scale settings, without the need for off-line\nanalyses.",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning a pre-trained model (such as BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, T5, GPT,\netc.) has proven to be one of the most promising paradigms in recent NLP\nresearch. However, numerous recent works indicate that fine-tuning suffers from\nthe instability problem, i.e., tuning the same model under the same setting\nresults in significantly different performance. Many recent works have proposed\ndifferent methods to solve this problem, but there is no theoretical\nunderstanding of why and how these methods work. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel theoretical stability analysis of fine-tuning that focuses on two\ncommonly used settings, namely, full fine-tuning and head tuning. We define the\nstability under each setting and prove the corresponding stability bounds. The\ntheoretical bounds explain why and how several existing methods can stabilize\nthe fine-tuning procedure. In addition to being able to explain most of the\nobserved empirical discoveries, our proposed theoretical analysis framework can\nalso help in the design of effective and provable methods. Based on our theory,\nwe propose three novel strategies to stabilize the fine-tuning procedure,\nnamely, Maximal Margin Regularizer (MMR), Multi-Head Loss (MHLoss), and Self\nUnsupervised Re-Training (SURT). We extensively evaluate our proposed\napproaches on 11 widely used real-world benchmark datasets, as well as hundreds\nof synthetic classification datasets.

To address this issue, this paper\nproposes FUSEE, a FUlly memory-diSaggrEgated KV StorE that brings\ndisaggregation to metadata management.

To\nscalably replicate the index on clients, FUSEE proposes a client-centric\nreplication protocol that allows clients to concurrently access and modify the\nreplicated index. To efficiently manage disaggregated memory, FUSEE adopts a\ntwo-level memory management scheme that splits the memory management duty among\nclients and memory nodes. Finally, to handle the metadata corruption under\nclient failures, FUSEE leverages an embedded operation log scheme to repair\nmetadata with low log maintenance overhead.

    "title": "Neighborhood Homophily-Guided Graph Convolutional Network",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable advances in\ngraph-oriented tasks. However, many real-world graphs contain heterophily or\nlow homophily, challenging the homophily assumption of classical GNNs and\nresulting in low performance. Although many studies have emerged to improve the\nuniversality of GNNs, they rarely consider the label reuse and the correlation\nof their proposed metrics and models. In this paper, we first design a new\nmetric, named Neighborhood Homophily (\\textit{NH}), to measure the label\ncomplexity or purity in the neighborhood of nodes. Furthermore, we incorporate\nthis metric into the classical graph convolutional network (GCN) architecture\nand propose \\textbf{N}eighborhood \\textbf{H}omophily-\\textbf{G}uided\n\\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{C}onvolutional \\textbf{N}etwork (\\textbf{NHGCN}). In\nthis framework, nodes are grouped by estimated \\textit{NH} values to achieve\nintra-group weight sharing during message propagation and aggregation. Then the\ngenerated node predictions are used to estimate and update new \\textit{NH}\nvalues. The two processes of metric estimation and model inference are\nalternately optimized to achieve better node classification. Extensive\nexperiments on both homophilous and heterophilous benchmarks demonstrate that\n\\textbf{NHGCN} achieves state-of-the-art overall performance on semi-supervised\nnode classification for the universality problem.",

    "abstract": "Many real-world tasks, from house-cleaning to cooking, can be formulated as\nmulti-object rearrangement problems -- where an agent needs to get specific\nobjects into appropriate goal states. For such problems, we focus on the\nsetting that assumes a pre-specified goal state, availability of perfect\nmanipulation and object recognition capabilities, and a static map of the\nenvironment but unknown initial location of objects to be rearranged. Our goal\nis to enable home-assistive intelligent agents to efficiently plan for\nrearrangement under such partial observability. This requires efficient\ntrade-offs between exploration of the environment and planning for\nrearrangement, which is challenging because of long-horizon nature of the\nproblem. To make progress on this problem, we first analyze the effects of\nvarious factors such as number of objects and receptacles, agent carrying\ncapacity, environment layouts etc. on exploration and planning for\nrearrangement using classical methods. We then investigate both monolithic and\nmodular deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods for planning in our setting.\nWe find that monolithic DRL methods do not succeed at long-horizon planning\nneeded for multi-object rearrangement. Instead, modular greedy approaches\nsurprisingly perform reasonably well and emerge as competitive baselines for\nplanning with partial observability in multi-object rearrangement problems. We\nalso show that our greedy modular agents are empirically optimal when the\nobjects that need to be rearranged are uniformly distributed in the environment\n-- thereby contributing baselines with strong performance for future work on\nmulti-object rearrangement planning in partially observable settings.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are nowadays ubiquitous in many domains such as\ncomputer vision. However, due to their high latency, the deployment of DNNs\nhinges on the development of compression techniques such as quantization which\nconsists in lowering the number of bits used to encode the weights and\nactivations. Growing concerns for privacy and security have motivated the\ndevelopment of data-free techniques, at the expanse of accuracy. In this paper,\nwe identity the uniformity of the quantization operator as a limitation of\nexisting approaches, and propose a data-free non-uniform method. More\nspecifically, we argue that to be readily usable without dedicated hardware and\nimplementation, non-uniform quantization shall not change the nature of the\nmathematical operations performed by the DNN. This leads to search among the\ncontinuous automorphisms of $(\\mathbb{R}_+^*,\\times)$, which boils down to the\npower functions defined by their exponent. To find this parameter, we propose\nto optimize the reconstruction error of each layer: in particular, we show that\nthis procedure is locally convex and admits a unique solution. At inference\ntime, we show that our approach, dubbed PowerQuant, only require simple\nmodifications in the quantized DNN activation functions.

    "abstract": "We investigate the effects on authorship identification tasks of a\nfundamental shift in how to conceive the vectorial representations of documents\nthat are given as input to a supervised learner. In ``classic'' authorship\nanalysis a feature vector represents a document, the value of a feature\nrepresents (an increasing function of) the relative frequency of the feature in\nthe document, and the class label represents the author of the document. We\ninstead investigate the situation in which a feature vector represents an\nunordered pair of documents, the value of a feature represents the absolute\ndifference in the relative frequencies (or increasing functions thereof) of the\nfeature in the two documents, and the class label indicates whether the two\ndocuments are from the same author or not. This latter (learner-independent)\ntype of representation has been occasionally used before, but has never been\nstudied systematically. We argue that it is advantageous, and that in some\ncases (e.g., authorship verification) it provides a much larger quantity of\ninformation to the training process than the standard representation. The\nexperiments that we carry out on several publicly available datasets (among\nwhich one that we here make available for the first time) show that feature\nvectors representing pairs of documents (that we here call Diff-Vectors) bring\nabout systematic improvements in the effectiveness of authorship identification\ntasks, and especially so when training data are scarce (as it is often the case\nin real-life authorship identification scenarios). Our experiments tackle\nsame-author verification, authorship verification, and closed-set authorship\nattribution; while DVs are naturally geared for solving the 1st, we also\nprovide two novel methods for solving the 2nd and 3rd that use a solver for the\n1st as a building block.",

Data augmentation, which is\neffective at preventing overfitting in standard training, has been observed by\nmany previous works to be ineffective in mitigating overfitting in adversarial\ntraining. This work proves that, contrary to previous findings, data\naugmentation alone can significantly boost accuracy and robustness in\nadversarial training. We find that the hardness and the diversity of data\naugmentation are important factors in combating robust overfitting. In general,\ndiversity can improve both accuracy and robustness, while hardness can boost\nrobustness at the cost of accuracy within a certain limit and degrade them both\nover that limit. To mitigate robust overfitting, we first propose a new crop\ntransformation, Cropshift, which has improved diversity compared to the\nconventional one (Padcrop).

Intuitive robot teaching methods are\nrequired to quickly and flexibly adapt the robot programs to new tasks.\nGestures have an essential role in human communication. However, in\nhuman-robot-interaction scenarios, gesture-based user interfaces are so far\nused rarely, and if they employ a one-to-one mapping of gestures to robot\ncontrol variables. In this paper, we propose a method that infers the user's\nintent based on gesture episodes, the context of the situation, and common\nsense.

    "abstract": "In a world increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence, it is more\nimportant than ever to consider the ethical implications of artificial\nintelligence on humanity. One key under-explored challenge is labeler bias,\nwhich can create inherently biased datasets for training and subsequently lead\nto inaccurate or unfair decisions in healthcare, employment, education, and law\nenforcement. Hence, we conducted a study to investigate and measure the\nexistence of labeler bias using images of people from different ethnicities and\nsexes in a labeling task. Our results show that participants possess\nstereotypes that influence their decision-making process and that labeler\ndemographics impact assigned labels. We also discuss how labeler bias\ninfluences datasets and, subsequently, the models trained on them. Overall, a\nhigh degree of transparency must be maintained throughout the entire artificial\nintelligence training process to identify and correct biases in the data as\nearly as possible.",

Existing work on the\nautomatic generation of natural language counter-arguments does not address the\nrelation to the conclusion, possibly because many arguments leave their\nconclusion implicit. In this paper, we hypothesize that the key to effective\ncounter-argument generation is to explicitly model the argument's conclusion\nand to ensure that the stance of the generated counter is opposite to that\nconclusion. In particular, we propose a multitask approach that jointly learns\nto generate both the conclusion and the counter of an input argument. The\napproach employs a stance-based ranking component that selects the counter from\na diverse set of generated candidates whose stance best opposes the generated\nconclusion. In both automatic and manual evaluation, we provide evidence that\nour approach generates more relevant and stance-adhering counters than strong\nbaselines.",

This tedious process for volumetric data becomes\nmore complex when not all required information is available in a single imaging\ndomain as is the case for PET/CT data.

    "abstract": "Designing dialog tutors has been challenging as it involves modeling the\ndiverse and complex pedagogical strategies employed by human tutors. Although\nthere have been significant recent advances in neural conversational systems\nusing large language models and growth in available dialog corpora, dialog\ntutoring has largely remained unaffected by these advances. In this paper, we\nrigorously analyze various generative language models on two dialog tutoring\ndatasets for language learning using automatic and human evaluations to\nunderstand the new opportunities brought by these advances as well as the\nchallenges we must overcome to build models that would be usable in real\neducational settings. We find that although current approaches can model\ntutoring in constrained learning scenarios when the number of concepts to be\ntaught and possible teacher strategies are small, they perform poorly in less\nconstrained scenarios. Our human quality evaluation shows that both models and\nground-truth annotations exhibit low performance in terms of equitable\ntutoring, which measures learning opportunities for students and how engaging\nthe dialog is. To understand the behavior of our models in a real tutoring\nsetting, we conduct a user study using expert annotators and find a\nsignificantly large number of model reasoning errors in 45% of conversations.\nFinally, we connect our findings to outline future work.",

It consists in a\nseparated training of two pipe-lined predictive models. At first, a certain\nnumber of independent neural networks are trained with data-sets taken from\ndifferent subsets of the parameter space. Successively, a second predictive\nmodel is specialized to properly combine the first-stage guesses and compute\nthe right predictions.

In this novel study, we employed a machine learning algorithm, the\nmulti-layer perceptron (MLP), to directly classify 2+2 and 3+1 quadruples based\non their stability (or long-term boundedness). The training data sets for the\nclassification, comprised of $5\\times10^5$ quadruples each, were integrated\nusing the highly accurate direct $N$-body code MSTAR. We also carried out a\nlimited parameter space study of zero-inclination systems to directly compare\nquadruples to triples. We found that both our quadruple MLP models perform\nbetter than a `nested' triple MLP approach, which is especially significant for\n3+1 quadruples. The classification accuracies for the 2+2 MLP and 3+1 MLP\nmodels are 94% and 93% respectively, while the scores for the `nested' triple\napproach are 88% and 66% respectively.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new approach which uses the tools within Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) software libraries as an alternative way of solving partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) that have been discretised using standard\nnumerical methods. In particular, we describe how to represent numerical\ndiscretisations arising from the finite volume and finite element methods by\npre-determining the weights of convolutional layers within a neural network. As\nthe weights are defined by the discretisation scheme, no training of the\nnetwork is required and the solutions obtained are identical (accounting for\nsolver tolerances) to those obtained with standard codes often written in\nFortran or C++. We also explain how to implement the Jacobi method and a\nmultigrid solver using the functions available in AI libraries. For the latter,\nwe use a U-Net architecture which is able to represent a sawtooth multigrid\nmethod. A benefit of using AI libraries in this way is that one can exploit\ntheir power and their built-in technologies. For example, their executions are\nalready optimised for different computer architectures, whether it be CPUs,\nGPUs or new-generation AI processors. In this article, we apply the proposed\napproach to eigenvalue problems in reactor physics where neutron transport is\ndescribed by diffusion theory. For a fuel assembly benchmark, we demonstrate\nthat the solution obtained from our new approach is the same (accounting for\nsolver tolerances) as that obtained from the same discretisation coded in a\nstandard way using Fortran. We then proceed to solve a reactor core benchmark\nusing the new approach.",

    "abstract": "Primal heuristics are important for solving mixed integer linear programs,\nbecause they find feasible solutions that facilitate branch and bound search.

Existing divers rely on generic decision rules that\nfail to exploit structural commonality between similar problem instances that\noften arise in practice. Therefore, we propose L2Dive to learn specific diving\nheuristics with graph neural networks: We train generative models to predict\nvariable assignments and leverage the duality of linear programs to make diving\ndecisions based on the model's predictions. L2Dive is fully integrated into the\nopen-source solver SCIP. We find that L2Dive outperforms standard divers to\nfind better feasible solutions on a range of combinatorial optimization\nproblems. For real-world applications from server load balancing and neural\nnetwork verification, L2Dive improves the primal-dual integral by up to 7%\n(35%) on average over a tuned (default) solver baseline and reduces average\nsolving time by 20% (29%).",

    "abstract": "Distributed algorithms solving agreement problems like consensus or state\nmachine replication are essential components of modern fault-tolerant\ndistributed services. They are also notoriously hard to understand and reason\nabout. Their complexity stems from the different assumptions on the environment\nthey operate with, i.e., process or network link failures, Byzantine failures\netc. In this paper, we propose a novel abstract representation of the dynamics\nof such protocols which focuses on quorums of responses (votes) to a request\n(proposal) that form during a run of the protocol. We show that focusing on\nsuch quorums, a run of a protocol can be viewed as working over a tree\nstructure where different branches represent different possible outcomes of the\nprotocol, the goal being to stabilize on the choice of a fixed branch. This\nabstraction resembles the description of recent protocols used in Blockchain\ninfrastructures, e.g., the protocol supporting Bitcoin or HotStuff. We show\nthat this abstraction supports reasoning about the safety of various\nalgorithms, e.g., Paxos, PBFT, Raft, and HotStuff, in a uniform way. In\ngeneral, it provides a novel induction based argument for proving that such\nprotocols are safe.",

However, representing each color one by one limits peak brightness and\ndynamic range in holographic displays.\nThis paper introduces a new driving scheme, HoloHDR, for realizing higher\ndynamic range images in holographic displays. Unlike the conventional driving\nscheme, in HoloHDR, three light sources illuminate each displayed hologram\nsimultaneously at various brightness levels. In this way, HoloHDR reconstructs\na multiplanar three-dimensional target scene using consecutive multi-color\nholograms and persistence of vision. We co-optimize multi-color holograms and\nrequired brightness levels from each light source using a gradient\ndescent-based optimizer with a combination of application-specific loss terms.\nWe experimentally demonstrate that HoloHDR can increase the brightness levels\nin holographic displays up to three times with support for a broader dynamic\nrange, unlocking new potentials for perceptual realism in holographic displays.",

One promising approach\nis the use of neuromorphic sensors and spiking neural networks (SNNs)\nimplemented in neuromorphic processors for sparse event-driven sensing.\nHowever, this requires resource-efficient SNN mechanisms for temporal encoding,\nwhich need to consider that these systems process information in a streaming\nmanner, with physical time being an intrinsic property of their operation. In\nthis work, two candidate neurocomputational elements for temporal encoding and\nfeature extraction in SNNs described in recent literature - the spiking\ntime-difference encoder (TDE) and disynaptic excitatory-inhibitory (E-I)\nelements - are comparatively investigated in a keyword-spotting task on\nformants computed from spoken digits in the TIDIGITS dataset. While both\nencoders improve performance over direct classification of the formant features\nin the training data, enabling a complete binary classification with a logistic\nregression model, they show no clear improvements on the test set.\nResource-efficient keyword spotting applications may benefit from the use of\nthese encoders, but further work on methods for learning the time constants and\nweights is required to investigate their full potential.",

Currently, semi-supervised\nlearning technique that harnesses freely-available unlabeled data to compensate\nfor limited labeled data can boost the performance in numerous vision tasks,\nwhich heuristically can be applied to tackle issues in FSCIL, i.e., the\nSemi-supervised FSCIL (Semi-FSCIL). So far, very limited work focuses on the\nSemi-FSCIL task, leaving the adaptability issue of semi-supervised learning to\nthe FSCIL task unresolved. In this paper, we focus on this adaptability issue\nand present a simple yet efficient Semi-FSCIL framework named Uncertainty-aware\nDistillation with Class-Equilibrium (UaD-CE), encompassing two modules UaD and\nCE. Specifically, when incorporating unlabeled data into each incremental\nsession, we introduce the CE module that employs a class-balanced self-training\nto avoid the gradual dominance of easy-to-classified classes on pseudo-label\ngeneration. To distill reliable knowledge from the reference model, we further\nimplement the UaD module that combines uncertainty-guided knowledge refinement\nwith adaptive distillation.

    "abstract": "Weakest precondition transformers are essential notions for program\nverification, and various extensions have been studied. However, only a few\nconsider both higher-order languages and syntactic calculation of weakest\nprecondition transformers. In this paper, we consider weakest precondition\ntransformers for a higher-order functional language with computational effects\nand recursion and show that we can calculate them via a CPS transformation. We\nprove this in a general framework of categorical semantics. Because of this\ngenerality, two existing methods for program verification can be understood as\ninstances of our result. Specifically, we show how to instantiate our result to\n(1) verification of trace properties by Kobayashi et al. and (2) expected cost\nanalysis by Avanzini et al.",

    "title": "Fiduciary Responsibility: Facilitating Public Trust in Automated  Decision Making",
    "abstract": "Automated decision-making systems are being increasingly deployed and affect\nthe public in a multitude of positive and negative ways. Governmental and\nprivate institutions use these systems to process information according to\ncertain human-devised rules in order to address social problems or\norganizational challenges. Both research and real-world experience indicate\nthat the public lacks trust in automated decision-making systems and the\ninstitutions that deploy them. The recreancy theorem argues that the public is\nmore likely to trust and support decisions made or influenced by automated\ndecision-making systems if the institutions that administer them meet their\nfiduciary responsibility. However, often the public is never informed of how\nthese systems operate and resultant institutional decisions are made. A ``black\nbox'' effect of automated decision-making systems reduces the public's\nperceptions of integrity and trustworthiness. The result is that the public\nloses the capacity to identify, challenge, and rectify unfairness or the costs\nassociated with the loss of public goods or benefits.\nThe current position paper defines and explains the role of fiduciary\nresponsibility within an automated decision-making system. We formulate an\nautomated decision-making system as a data science lifecycle (DSL) and examine\nthe implications of fiduciary responsibility within the context of the DSL.\nFiduciary responsibility within DSLs provides a methodology for addressing the\npublic's lack of trust in automated decision-making systems and the\ninstitutions that employ them to make decisions affecting the public. We posit\nthat fiduciary responsibility manifests in several contexts of a DSL, each of\nwhich requires its own mitigation of sources of mistrust. To instantiate\nfiduciary responsibility, a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) predictive\npolicing case study is examined.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an event-driven solution to genotype imputation, a\ntechnique used to statistically infer missing genetic markers in DNA. The work\nimplements the widely accepted Li and Stephens model, primary contributor to\nthe computational complexity of modern x86 solutions, in an attempt to\ndetermine whether further investigation of the application is warranted in the\nevent-driven domain. The model is implemented using graph-based Hidden Markov\nModeling and executed as a customized forward/backward dynamic programming\nalgorithm. The solution uses an event-driven paradigm to map the algorithm to\nthousands of concurrent cores, where events are small messages that carry both\ncontrol and data within the algorithm. The design of a single processing\nelement is discussed. This is then extended across multiple FPGAs and executed\non a custom RISC-V NoC FPGA cluster called POETS. Results demonstrate how the\nalgorithm scales over increasing hardware resources and a 48 FPGA run\ndemonstrates a 270X reduction in wall-clock processing time when compared to a\nsingle-threaded x86 solution. Optimisation of the algorithm via linear\ninterpolation is then introduced and tested, with results demonstrating a\nwall-clock reduction time of approx. 5 orders of magnitude when compared to a\nsimilarly optimised x86 solution.",

    "abstract": "In order to develop trustworthy healthcare artificial intelligence (AI)\nprospective and ergonomics studies that consider the complexity and reality of\nreal-world applications of AI systems are needed. To achieve this, technology\ndevelopers and deploying organisations need to form collaborative partnerships.\nThis entails access to healthcare data, which frequently might also include\npotentially identifiable data such as audio recordings of calls made to an\nambulance service call centre. Information Governance (IG) processes have been\nput in place to govern the use of personal confidential data. However,\nnavigating IG processes in the formative stages of AI development and\npre-deployment can be challenging, because the legal basis for data sharing is\nexplicit only for the purpose of delivering patient care, i.e., once a system\nis put into service. In this paper we describe our experiences of managing IG\nfor the assurance of healthcare AI, using the example of an\nout-of-hospital-cardiac-arrest recognition software within the context of the\nWelsh Ambulance Service. We frame IG as a socio-technical process. IG processes\nfor the development of trustworthy healthcare AI rely on information governance\nwork, which entails dialogue, negotiation, and trade-offs around the legal\nbasis for data sharing, data requirements and data control. Information\ngovernance work should start early in the design life cycle and will likely\ncontinue throughout. This includes a focus on establishing and building\nrelationships, as well as a focus on organisational readiness deeper\nunderstanding of both AI technologies as well as their safety assurance\nrequirements.",

    "abstract": "Few-shot font generation (FFG) aims to preserve the underlying global\nstructure of the original character while generating target fonts by referring\nto a few samples. It has been applied to font library creation, a personalized\nsignature, and other scenarios. Existing FFG methods explicitly disentangle\ncontent and style of reference glyphs universally or component-wisely. However,\nthey ignore the difference between glyphs in different styles and the\nsimilarity of glyphs in the same style, which results in artifacts such as\nlocal distortions and style inconsistency. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel font generation approach by learning the Difference between different\nstyles and the Similarity of the same style (DS-Font). We introduce contrastive\nlearning to consider the positive and negative relationship between styles.\nSpecifically, we propose a multi-layer style projector for style encoding and\nrealize a distinctive style representation via our proposed Cluster-level\nContrastive Style (CCS) loss. In addition, we design a multi-task patch\ndiscriminator, which comprehensively considers different areas of the image and\nensures that each style can be distinguished independently. We conduct\nqualitative and quantitative evaluations comprehensively to demonstrate that\nour approach achieves significantly better results than state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is one of the common healthcare\napplications that assist doctors to monitor patients with chronic or acute\nillness at remote locations, elderly people in-home care, and even hospitalized\npatients. The reliability of manual patient monitoring systems depends on staff\ntime management which is dependent on their workload. Conventional patient\nmonitoring involves invasive approaches which require skin contact to monitor\nhealth status. This study aims to do a comprehensive review of RPM systems\nincluding adopted advanced technologies, AI impact on RPM, challenges and\ntrends in AI-enabled RPM. This review explores the benefits and challenges of\npatient-centric RPM architectures enabled with Internet of Things wearable\ndevices and sensors using the cloud, fog, edge, and blockchain technologies.\nThe role of AI in RPM ranges from physical activity classification to chronic\ndisease monitoring and vital signs monitoring in emergency settings. This\nreview results show that AI-enabled RPM architectures have transformed\nhealthcare monitoring applications because of their ability to detect early\ndeterioration in patients' health, personalize individual patient health\nparameter monitoring using federated learning, and learn human behavior\npatterns using techniques such as reinforcement learning.

To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first deep learning framework that fuses gyroscope data\nand image content for both deep homography and optical flow learning.

    "abstract": "The lacking of analytic solutions of diverse partial differential equations\n(PDEs) gives birth to series of computational techniques for numerical\nsolutions. In machine learning, numerous latest advances of solver designs are\naccomplished in developing neural operators, a kind of mesh-free approximators\nof the infinite-dimensional operators that map between different\nparameterization spaces of equation solutions. Although neural operators\nexhibit generalization capacities for learning an entire PDE family\nsimultaneously, they become less accurate and explainable while learning\nlong-term behaviours of non-linear PDE families. In this paper, we propose\nKoopman neural operator (KNO), a new neural operator, to overcome these\nchallenges. With the same objective of learning an infinite-dimensional mapping\nbetween Banach spaces that serves as the solution operator of target PDE\nfamily, our approach differs from existing models by formulating a non-linear\ndynamic system of equation solution. By approximating the Koopman operator, an\ninfinite-dimensional linear operator governing all possible observations of the\ndynamic system, to act on the flow mapping of dynamic system, we can\nequivalently learn the solution of an entire non-linear PDE family by solving\nsimple linear prediction problems. In zero-shot prediction and long-term\nprediction experiments on representative PDEs (e.g., the Navier-Stokes\nequation), KNO exhibits notable advantages in breaking the tradeoff between\naccuracy and efficiency (e.g., model size) while previous state-of-the-art\nmodels are limited. These results suggest that more efficient PDE solvers can\nbe developed by the joint efforts from physics and machine learning.",

We propose a new synthesis approach with the primary\nmotivation to solve efficiently the synthesis problem for specifications with\nbounded temporal operators, in particular those with large bounds. The\nexperimental evaluation of our method shows that for this type of\nspecifications, it outperforms state-of-art synthesis tools, demonstrating that\nit is a promising approach to efficiently treating quantitative timing\nconstraints in safety specifications.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of learning goal-conditioned policies in Minecraft, a\npopular, widely accessible yet challenging open-ended environment for\ndeveloping human-level multi-task agents. We first identify two main challenges\nof learning such policies: 1) the indistinguishability of tasks from the state\ndistribution, due to the vast scene diversity, and 2) the non-stationary nature\nof environment dynamics caused by partial observability. To tackle the first\nchallenge, we propose Goal-Sensitive Backbone (GSB) for the policy to encourage\nthe emergence of goal-relevant visual state representations. To tackle the\nsecond challenge, the policy is further fueled by an adaptive horizon\nprediction module that helps alleviate the learning uncertainty brought by the\nnon-stationary dynamics. Experiments on 20 Minecraft tasks show that our method\nsignificantly outperforms the best baseline so far; in many of them, we double\nthe performance. Our ablation and exploratory studies then explain how our\napproach beat the counterparts and also unveil the surprising bonus of\nzero-shot generalization to new scenes (biomes). We hope our agent could help\nshed some light on learning goal-conditioned, multi-task agents in challenging,\nopen-ended environments like Minecraft.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Assess the feasibility of using ChatGPT or a similar AI-based\nchatbot for patient-provider communication. Participants: A US representative\nsample of 430 study participants aged 18 and above. 53.2% of respondents\nanalyzed were women; their average age was 47.1. Exposure: Ten representative\nnon-administrative patient-provider interactions were extracted from the EHR.\nPatients' questions were placed in ChatGPT with a request for the chatbot to\nrespond using approximately the same word count as the human provider's\nresponse. In the survey, each patient's question was followed by a provider- or\nChatGPT-generated response. Participants were informed that five responses were\nprovider-generated and five were chatbot-generated. Participants were asked,\nand incentivized financially, to correctly identify the response source.\nParticipants were also asked about their trust in chatbots' functions in\npatient-provider communication, using a Likert scale of 1-5. Results: The\ncorrect classification of responses ranged between 49.0% to 85.7% for different\nquestions. On average, chatbot responses were correctly identified 65.5% of the\ntime, and provider responses were correctly distinguished 65.1% of the time. On\naverage, responses toward patients' trust in chatbots' functions were weakly\npositive (mean Likert score: 3.4), with lower trust as the health-related\ncomplexity of the task in questions increased. Conclusions: ChatGPT responses\nto patient questions were weakly distinguishable from provider responses.\nLaypeople appear to trust the use of chatbots to answer lower risk health\nquestions.",

    "title": "Hyper Hoare Logic: (Dis-)Proving Program Hyperproperties (extended  version)",
    "abstract": "Hoare logics are proof systems that allow one to formally establish\nproperties of computer programs. Traditional Hoare logics prove properties of\nindividual program executions (so-called trace properties, such as functional\ncorrectness). On the one hand, Hoare logic has been generalized to prove\nproperties of multiple executions of a program (so-called hyperproperties, such\nas determinism or non-interference). These program logics prove the absence of\n(bad combinations of) executions. On the other hand, program logics similar to\nHoare logic have been proposed to disprove program properties (e.g.,\nIncorrectness Logic), by proving the existence of (bad combinations of)\nexecutions. All of these logics have in common that they specify program\nproperties using assertions over a fixed number of states, for instance, a\nsingle pre- and post-state for functional properties or pairs of pre- and\npost-states for non-interference. In this paper, we present Hyper Hoare Logic,\na generalization of Hoare logic that lifts assertions to properties of\narbitrary sets of states. The resulting logic is simple yet expressive: its\njudgments can express arbitrary trace- and hyperproperties over the terminating\nexecutions of a program. By allowing assertions to reason about sets of states,\nHyper Hoare Logic can reason about both the absence and the existence of\n(combinations of) executions, and, thereby, supports both proving and\ndisproving program (hyper-)properties within the same logic. In fact, we prove\nthat Hyper Hoare Logic subsumes the properties handled by numerous existing\ncorrectness and incorrectness logics, and can express hyperproperties that no\nexisting Hoare logic can. We also prove that Hyper Hoare Logic is sound and\ncomplete. All our technical results have been proved in Isabelle/HOL.",

However, a critical challenge is the inherent intricate\none-to-many mapping between speech and gestures. Previous studies have explored\nand achieved significant progress with generative models. Notwithstanding, most\nsynthetic gestures are still vastly less natural. This paper presents\nDiffMotion, a novel speech-driven gesture synthesis architecture based on\ndiffusion models. The model comprises an autoregressive temporal encoder and a\ndenoising diffusion probability Module. The encoder extracts the temporal\ncontext of the speech input and historical gestures. The diffusion module\nlearns a parameterized Markov chain to gradually convert a simple distribution\ninto a complex distribution and generates the gestures according to the\naccompanied speech.

    "abstract": "Transformers have been widely used for video processing owing to the\nmulti-head self attention (MHSA) mechanism. However, the MHSA mechanism\nencounters an intrinsic difficulty for video inpainting, since the features\nassociated with the corrupted regions are degraded and incur inaccurate self\nattention. This problem, termed query degradation, may be mitigated by first\ncompleting optical flows and then using the flows to guide the self attention,\nwhich was verified in our previous work - flow-guided transformer (FGT). We\nfurther exploit the flow guidance and propose FGT++ to pursue more effective\nand efficient video inpainting. First, we design a lightweight flow completion\nnetwork by using local aggregation and edge loss. Second, to address the query\ndegradation, we propose a flow guidance feature integration module, which uses\nthe motion discrepancy to enhance the features, together with a flow-guided\nfeature propagation module that warps the features according to the flows.\nThird, we decouple the transformer along the temporal and spatial dimensions,\nwhere flows are used to select the tokens through a temporally deformable MHSA\nmechanism, and global tokens are combined with the inner-window local tokens\nthrough a dual perspective MHSA mechanism. FGT++ is experimentally evaluated to\nbe outperforming the existing video inpainting networks qualitatively and\nquantitatively.",

    "abstract": "In this article, a general model for 1D thermal wave interference is derived\nfor multi-layered coating systems on a thermally thick substrate using the same\nprinciples as for the well established one-layered and two-layered coating\ncases. Using the lock-in thermography principle, an illumination source\nmodulates the surface of those systems periodically by a planar, sinusoidal\nwave form with a fixed frequency. The coating systems absorb the optical energy\non its surface and convert it into thermal energy, resulting in the propagation\nof a spatially and temporally periodic thermal wave with the same frequency.\nThese thermal waves, originating at the surface, are reflected and transmitted\nat each interface leading to infinitely many wave trains that need to be\ntracked in order to formulate the final surface temperature as a superposition\nof all these waves. The heat transfer inside the object depends on the layer\nthickness of each coating, but also on the thermal properties of each layer\nmaterial. The goal is to have a mathematical and physical model which describes\nthe phase angle data measured by an infrared camera. Having these data, the\nmain objective of this paper is to determine the thickness of each coating\nlayer. In practice, the thermal properties of the layers usually are unknown,\nwhich makes the process even more difficult. For that reason, this article\npresents a concept to determine the thermal properties in advance.",

    "abstract": "Personal data collected at scale from surveys or digital devices offers\nimportant insights for statistical analysis and scientific research. Safely\nsharing such data while protecting privacy is however challenging.\nAnonymization allows data to be shared while minimizing privacy risks, but\ntraditional anonymization techniques have been repeatedly shown to provide\nlimited protection against re-identification attacks in practice. Among modern\nanonymization techniques, synthetic data generation (SDG) has emerged as a\npotential solution to find a good tradeoff between privacy and statistical\nutility. Synthetic data is typically generated using algorithms that learn the\nstatistical distribution of the original records, to then generate \"artificial\"\nrecords that are structurally and statistically similar to the original ones.\nYet, the fact that synthetic records are \"artificial\" does not, per se,\nguarantee that privacy is protected. In this work, we systematically evaluate\nthe tradeoffs between protecting privacy and preserving statistical utility for\na wide range of synthetic data generation algorithms. Modeling privacy as\nprotection against attribute inference attacks (AIAs), we extend and adapt\nlinear reconstruction attacks, which have not been previously studied in the\ncontext of synthetic data. While prior work suggests that AIAs may be effective\nonly on few outlier records, we show they can be very effective even on\nrandomly selected records. We evaluate attacks on synthetic datasets ranging\nfrom 10^3 to 10^6 records, showing that even for the same generative model, the\nattack effectiveness can drastically increase when a larger number of synthetic\nrecords is generated. Overall, our findings prove that synthetic data is\nsubject to privacy-utility tradeoffs just like other anonymization techniques:\nwhen good utility is preserved, attribute inference can be a risk for many data\nsubjects.",

The movement of smartphone camera hardware leaks\nacoustic information because images unwittingly modulate ambient sound as\nimperceptible distortions. Our experiments find that the side channel is\nfurther amplified by intrinsic behaviors of Complementary\nmetal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) rolling shutters and movable lenses such as in\nOptical Image Stabilization (OIS) and Auto Focus (AF). Our paper characterizes\nthe limits of acoustic information leakage caused by structure-borne sound that\nperturbs the POV of smartphone cameras. In contrast with traditional\noptical-acoustic eavesdropping on vibrating objects, this side channel requires\nno line of sight and no object within the camera's field of view (images of a\nceiling suffice). Our experiments test the limits of this side channel with a\nnovel signal processing pipeline that extracts and recognizes the leaked\nacoustic information.

    "abstract": "The reinforcement learning research area contains a wide range of methods for\nsolving the problems of intelligent agent control. Despite the progress that\nhas been made, the task of creating a highly autonomous agent is still a\nsignificant challenge. One potential solution to this problem is intrinsic\nmotivation, a concept derived from developmental psychology. This review\nconsiders the existing methods for determining intrinsic motivation based on\nthe world model obtained by the agent. We propose a systematic approach to\ncurrent research in this field, which consists of three categories of methods,\ndistinguished by the way they utilize a world model in the agent's components:\ncomplementary intrinsic reward, exploration policy, and intrinsically motivated\ngoals. The proposed unified framework describes the architecture of agents\nusing a world model and intrinsic motivation to improve learning. The potential\nfor developing new techniques in this area of research is also examined.",

    "abstract": "Agile methodologies have become increasingly popular in recent years. Due to\nits inherent nature, agile methodologies involve stakeholders with a wide range\nof expertise and require interaction between them, relying on collaboration and\ncustomer involvement. Hence, agile methodologies encourage collaboration\nbetween all team members so that more efficient and effective processes are\nmaintained. Generating requirements can be challenging, as it requires the\nparticipation of multiple stakeholders who describe various aspects of the\nproject and possess a shared understanding of essential concepts. One simple\nmethod for capturing requirements using natural language is through user\nstories, which document the agreed-upon properties of a project. Stakeholders\ntry to strive for completeness while generating user stories, but the final\nuser story set may still be flawed. To address this issue, we propose SCOUT:\nSupporting Completeness of User Story Sets, which employs a natural language\nprocessing pipeline to extract key concepts from user stories and construct a\nknowledge graph by connecting related terms. The knowledge graph and different\nheuristics are then utilized to enhance the quality and completeness of the\nuser story sets by generating suggestions for the stakeholders. We perform a\nuser study to evaluate SCOUT and demonstrate its performance in constructing\nuser stories. The quantitative and qualitative results indicate that SCOUT\nsignificantly enhance the quality and completeness of the user story sets. Our\ncontribution is threefold. First, we develop heuristics to suggest new concepts\nto include in user stories by considering both the individuals' and other team\nmembers' contributions. Second, we implement an open-source collaborative tool\nto support writing user stories and ensuring their quality. Third, we share the\nexperimental setup and materials.",

    "abstract": "Although the rapid development of battery technology has greatly increased\nthe range of battery electric vehicle (BEV), the range anxiety is still a major\nconcern of BEV users or potential users. Previous work has proposed a framework\nexplaining the influential factors of range anxiety and users' trust toward the\nrange estimation system (RES) of BEV has been identified as a leading factor of\nrange anxiety. The trust in RES may further influence BEV users' charging\ndecisions. However, the formation of trust in RES of BEVs has not yet explored.\nIn this work, a questionnaire has been designed to investigate BEV users' trust\nin RES and further explore the influential factors of BEV users' charging\ndecision. In total, 152 samples collected from the BEV users in mainland China\nhave been analyzed. The BEV users' gender, driving area, knowledge of BEV or\nRES, system usability and trust in battery system of smartphones have been\nidentified as influential factors of RES in BEVs, supporting the three-layer\nframework in automation-related trust (i.e., dispositional trust, situational\ntrust and learned trust). A connection between smartphone charging behaviors\nand BEV charging behaviors has also been observed. The results from this study\ncan provide insights on the design of RES in BEVs in order to alleviate range\nanxiety among users. The results can also inform the design of strategies\n(e.g., advertising, training and in-vehicle HMI design) that can facilitate\nmore rational charging decisions among BEV users.",

    "title": "Autonomous particles",
    "abstract": "Consider a reinforcement learning problem where an agent has access to a very\nlarge amount of information about the environment, but it can only take very\nfew actions to accomplish its task and to maximize its reward. Evidently, the\nmain problem for the agent is to learn a map from a very high-dimensional space\n(which represents its environment) to a very low-dimensional space (which\nrepresents its actions). The high-to-low dimensional map implies that most of\nthe information about the environment is irrelevant for the actions to be\ntaken, and only a small fraction of information is relevant. In this paper we\nargue that the relevant information need not be learned by brute force (which\nis the standard approach), but can be identified from the intrinsic symmetries\nof the system. We analyze in details a reinforcement learning problem of\nautonomous driving, where the corresponding symmetry is the Galilean symmetry,\nand argue that the learning task can be accomplished with very few relevant\nparameters, or, more precisely, invariants. For a numerical demonstration, we\nshow that the autonomous vehicles (which we call autonomous particles since\nthey describe very primitive vehicles) need only four relevant invariants to\nlearn how to drive very well without colliding with other particles. The simple\nmodel can be easily generalized to include different types of particles (e.g.\nfor cars, for pedestrians, for buildings, for road signs, etc.) with different\ntypes of relevant invariants describing interactions between them. We also\nargue that there must exist a field theory description of the learning system\nwhere autonomous particles would be described by fermionic degrees of freedom\nand interactions mediated by the relevant invariants would be described by\nbosonic degrees of freedom.",

Such a separation enables the use of reformulation\ntechniques, which transform how a model is represented in order to improve the\nefficiency of plan generation. Over the past decades, significant research\neffort has been devoted to the design of reformulation techniques.

But\nspecifying goals and restrictions for AI behavior is difficult. Similar to how\nparties to a legal contract cannot foresee every potential \"if-then\"\ncontingency of their future relationship, we cannot specify desired AI behavior\nfor all circumstances. Legal standards facilitate the robust communication of\ninherently vague and underspecified goals. Instructions (in the case of\nlanguage models, \"prompts\") that employ legal standards will allow AI agents to\ndevelop shared understandings of the spirit of a directive that can adapt to\nnovel situations, and generalize expectations regarding acceptable actions to\ntake in unspecified states of the world. Standards have built-in context that\nis lacking from other goal specification languages, such as plain language and\nprogramming languages. Through an empirical study on thousands of evaluation\nlabels we constructed from U.S. court opinions, we demonstrate that large\nlanguage models (LLMs) are beginning to exhibit an \"understanding\" of one of\nthe most relevant legal standards for AI agents: fiduciary obligations.\nPerformance comparisons across models suggest that, as LLMs continue to exhibit\nimproved core capabilities, their legal standards understanding will also\ncontinue to improve.

Hence, WaffleIron is a strong, easy-to-implement,\nbaseline for semantic segmentation of sparse outdoor point clouds.",

For example,\nwe might wish for an agent to adhere to a tacit understanding of commonsense,\nalign itself to a preference for how to behave for purposes of safety, or\ntaking on a particular role in an interactive game. Storytelling is a mode for\ncommunicating tacit procedural knowledge. We introduce a technique, Story\nShaping, in which a reinforcement learning agent infers tacit knowledge from an\nexemplar story of how to accomplish a task and intrinsically rewards itself for\nperforming actions that make its current environment adhere to that of the\ninferred story world. Specifically, Story Shaping infers a knowledge graph\nrepresentation of the world state from observations, and also infers a\nknowledge graph from the exemplar story. An intrinsic reward is generated based\non the similarity between the agent's inferred world state graph and the\ninferred story world graph.

In scenarios where training data is decentralized and resides on\nclient devices, SSL must be integrated with privacy-aware training techniques\nsuch as Federated Learning. We consider the problem of federated image\nclassification and study the performance and privacy challenges with existing\nfederated SSL (FSSL) approaches. Firstly, we note that even state-of-the-art\nFSSL algorithms can trivially compromise client privacy and other real-world\nconstraints such as client statelessness and communication cost. Secondly, we\nobserve that it is challenging to integrate EMA (Exponential Moving Average)\nupdates into the federated setting, which comes at a trade-off between\nperformance and communication cost. We propose a novel approach FedSwitch, that\nimproves privacy as well as generalization performance through Exponential\nMoving Average (EMA) updates. FedSwitch utilizes a federated semi-supervised\nteacher-student EMA framework with two features - local teacher adaptation and\nadaptive switching between teacher and student for pseudo-label generation.

In this\npaper, we argue that such models are not particularly well-suited for\nperforming scalable and robust planning in lifelong reinforcement learning\nscenarios and we propose new kinds of models that only model the relevant\naspects of the environment, which we call \"minimal value-equivalent partial\nmodels\". After providing a formal definition for these models, we provide\ntheoretical results demonstrating the scalability advantages of performing\nplanning with such models and then perform experiments to empirically\nillustrate our theoretical results. Then, we provide some useful heuristics on\nhow to learn these kinds of models with deep learning architectures and\nempirically demonstrate that models learned in such a way can allow for\nperforming planning that is robust to distribution shifts and compounding model\nerrors.

As such a\nfundamental skill, we expect object search to eventually become an\noff-the-shelf capability for any robot, similar to e.g., object detection,\nSLAM, and motion planning. However, existing approaches either make unrealistic\ncompromises (e.g., reduce the problem from 3D to 2D), resort to ad-hoc, greedy\nsearch strategies, or attempt to learn end-to-end policies in simulation that\nare yet to generalize across real robots and environments. This thesis argues\nthat through using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to\nmodel object search while exploiting structures in the human world (e.g.,\noctrees, correlations) and in human-robot interaction (e.g., spatial language),\na practical and effective system for generalized object search can be achieved.\nIn support of this argument, I develop methods and systems for (multi-)object\nsearch in 3D environments under uncertainty due to limited field of view,\nocclusion, noisy, unreliable detectors, spatial correlations between objects,\nand possibly ambiguous spatial language (e.g., \"The red car is behind Chase\nBank\"). Besides evaluation in simulators such as PyGame, AirSim, and AI2-THOR,\nI design and implement a robot-independent, environment-agnostic system for\ngeneralized object search in 3D and deploy it on the Boston Dynamics Spot\nrobot, the Kinova MOVO robot, and the Universal Robots UR5e robotic arm, to\nperform object search in different environments.

It was shown that this problem can be\nsolved without consensus by using byzantine quorum systems (requiring at least\n$2f+1$ validations per transaction in asynchronous systems). We show that it is\npossible to validate transactions in parallel with less than $f$ validations\nper transaction if each transaction spends no more that a small fraction of a\nbalance. Our solution relies on a novel quorum system that we introduce in this\npaper and that we call $(k_1,k_2)$-quorum systems. In the presence of a\nnon-adaptive adversary, these systems can be used to allow up to $k_1$\ntransactions to be validated concurrently and asynchronously but prevent more\nthan $k_2$ transactions from being validated. If the adversary is adaptive,\nthese systems can be used to allow $k_1$ transaction to be validated and\nprevent more than $k'_2 > k_2$ transactions from being validated, the\ndifference $k'_2-k_2$ being dependent on the quorum system's {\\em validation\nslack}, which we define in this paper.

    "abstract": "The challenges in applications of solar energy lies in its intermittency and\ndependency on meteorological parameters such as; solar radiation, ambient\ntemperature, rainfall, wind-speed etc., and many other physical parameters like\ndust accumulation etc. Hence, it is important to estimate the amount of solar\nphotovoltaic (PV) power generation for a specific geographical location.\nMachine learning (ML) models have gained importance and are widely used for\nprediction of solar power plant performance. In this paper, the impact of\nweather parameters on solar PV power generation is estimated by several\nEnsemble ML (EML) models like Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, and Voting for the\nfirst time. The performance of chosen ML algorithms is validated by field\ndataset of a 10kWp solar PV power plant in Eastern India region. Furthermore, a\ncomplete test-bed framework has been designed for data mining as well as to\nselect appropriate learning models. It also supports feature selection and\nreduction for dataset to reduce space and time complexity of the learning\nmodels. The results demonstrate greater prediction accuracy of around 96% for\nStacking and Voting EML models. The proposed work is a generalized one and can\nbe very useful for predicting the performance of large-scale solar PV power\nplants also.",

    "abstract": "Electrocardiography (ECG) signals can be considered as multi-variable\ntime-series. The state-of-the-art ECG data classification approaches, based on\neither feature engineering or deep learning techniques, treat separately\nspectral and time domains in machine learning systems. No spectral-time domain\ncommunication mechanism inside the classifier model can be found in current\napproaches, leading to difficulties in identifying complex ECG forms. In this\npaper, we proposed a novel deep learning model named Spectral Cross-domain\nneural network (SCDNN) with a new block called Soft-adaptive threshold spectral\nenhancement (SATSE), to simultaneously reveal the key information embedded in\nspectral and time domains inside the neural network. More precisely, the\ndomain-cross information is captured by a general Convolutional neural network\n(CNN) backbone, and different information sources are merged by a self-adaptive\nmechanism to mine the connection between time and spectral domains. In SATSE,\nthe knowledge from time and spectral domains is extracted via the Fast Fourier\nTransformation (FFT) with soft trainable thresholds in modified Sigmoid\nfunctions. The proposed SCDNN is tested with several classification tasks\nimplemented on the public ECG databases \\textit{PTB-XL} and \\textit{MIT-BIH}.\nSCDNN outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with a low computational cost\nregarding a variety of metrics in all classification tasks on both databases,\nby finding appropriate domains from the infinite spectral mapping. The\nconvergence of the trainable thresholds in the spectral domain is also\nnumerically investigated in this paper. The robust performance of SCDNN\nprovides a new perspective to exploit knowledge across deep learning models\nfrom time and spectral domains.

As a heart disorder, arrhythmia is a condition in\nwhich the heart's pumping mechanism becomes aberrant. The Electrocardiogram is\nused to analyze the arrhythmia problem from the ECG signals because of its\nfewer difficulties and cheapness. The heart peaks shown in the ECG graph are\nused to detect heart diseases, and the R peak is used to analyze arrhythmia\ndisease. Arrhythmia is grouped into two groups - Tachycardia and Bradycardia\nfor detection. In this paper, we discussed many different techniques such as\nDeep CNNs, LSTM, SVM, NN classifier, Wavelet, TQWT, etc., that have been used\nfor detecting arrhythmia using various datasets throughout the previous decade.\nThis work shows the analysis of some arrhythmia classification on the ECG\ndataset. Here, Data preprocessing, feature extraction, classification processes\nwere applied on most research work and achieved better performance for\nclassifying ECG signals to detect arrhythmia.

Time\nseries classification (TSC) is the task of assigning a time series to one of a\nset of predefined classes, usually based on a model learned from examples.\nDictionary-based methods for TSC rely on counting the frequency of certain\npatterns in time series and are important components of the currently most\naccurate TSC ensembles. One of the early dictionary-based methods was WEASEL,\nwhich at its time achieved SotA results while also being very fast. However, it\nis outperformed both in terms of speed and accuracy by other methods.\nFurthermore, its design leads to an unpredictably large memory footprint,\nmaking it inapplicable for many applications.\nIn this paper, we present WEASEL 2.0, a complete overhaul of WEASEL based on\ntwo recent advancements in TSC: Dilation and ensembling of randomized\nhyper-parameter settings. These two techniques allow WEASEL 2.0 to work with a\nfixed-size memory footprint while at the same time improving accuracy. Compared\nto 15 other SotA methods on the UCR benchmark set, WEASEL 2.0 is significantly\nmore accurate than other dictionary methods and not significantly worse than\nthe currently best methods.

We experiment by sending the XRP Ledger consensus messages over\ndifferent Named Data Networking communication models and prove that our chosen\nmodel lowers the number of messages at node level to minimum necessary, while\nmaintaining or improving blockchain performance by leveraging the possibilities\noffered by an overlay such as specific communication mechanisms.",

In addition to traditional `reductionist' techniques, the use of\nobservations and ethnography-style techniques have been proposed to identify\nrequirements. Research Problem: One frequently heard issue with observational\ntechniques is that they are costly to use, as developers would lose\nconsiderable time to partake, and also depend on luck in identifying\nrequirements. Very few experience reports exist to evaluate observational\ntechniques in practice. Results: In this experience report, we draw on several\ndata sources, covering insights from both developers and users. The data were\ncollected through 9 interviews with users and developers, and over 80 hours of\nobservation of prospective users in the maritime domain. We capture `knowns'\nand `unknowns' from both developers and users, and highlight the importance of\nobservational studies. Contribution: While observational techniques are costly\nto use, we conclude that essential information is uncovered, which is key for\ndevelopers to understand system users and their concerns.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, it has been claimed that releasing accurate statistical\ninformation on a database is likely to allow its complete reconstruction.\nDifferential privacy has been suggested as the appropriate methodology to\nprevent these attacks. These claims have recently been taken very seriously by\nthe U.S. Census Bureau and led them to adopt differential privacy for releasing\nU.S. Census data. This in turn has caused consternation among users of the\nCensus data due to the lack of accuracy of the protected outputs. It has also\nbrought legal action against the U.S. Department of Commerce. In this paper, we\ntrace the origins of the claim that releasing information on a database\nautomatically makes it vulnerable to being exposed by reconstruction attacks\nand we show that this claim is, in fact, incorrect. We also show that\nreconstruction can be averted by properly using traditional statistical\ndisclosure control (SDC) techniques. We further show that the geographic level\nat which exact counts are released is even more relevant to protection than the\nactual SDC method employed. Finally, we caution against confusing\nreconstruction and reidentification: using the quality of reconstruction as a\nmetric of reidentification results in exaggerated reidentification risk\nfigures.",

Emerging as an alternative to STbC, the superconducting\nelectrons (SCE) technology promises higher-speed clock frequencies at ultra-low\npower consumption. The rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) circuits have a\ntheoretical potential for three orders of magnitude reduction in power while\noperating at clock frequencies higher than 100 GHz.

The SAT\nattack is an attack that can break all the existing combinational logic locking\ntechniques. C-SAR can immunize against SAT attacks by increasing the key search\nspace and prolonging the clock cycles of attack inputs.

    "abstract": "Casting semantic segmentation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds as a 2D problem,\ne.g., via range projection, is an effective and popular approach. These\nprojection-based methods usually benefit from fast computations and, when\ncombined with techniques which use other point cloud representations, achieve\nstate-of-the-art results. Today, projection-based methods leverage 2D CNNs but\nrecent advances in computer vision show that vision transformers (ViTs) have\nachieved state-of-the-art results in many image-based benchmarks. In this work,\nwe question if projection-based methods for 3D semantic segmentation can\nbenefit from these latest improvements on ViTs. We answer positively but only\nafter combining them with three key ingredients: (a) ViTs are notoriously hard\nto train and require a lot of training data to learn powerful representations.\nBy preserving the same backbone architecture as for RGB images, we can exploit\nthe knowledge from long training on large image collections that are much\ncheaper to acquire and annotate than point clouds. We reach our best results\nwith pre-trained ViTs on large image datasets. (b) We compensate ViTs' lack of\ninductive bias by substituting a tailored convolutional stem for the classical\nlinear embedding layer. (c) We refine pixel-wise predictions with a\nconvolutional decoder and a skip connection from the convolutional stem to\ncombine low-level but fine-grained features of the the convolutional stem with\nthe high-level but coarse predictions of the ViT encoder. With these\ningredients, we show that our method, called RangeViT, outperforms existing\nprojection-based methods on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI.

    "abstract": "Ports are striving for innovative technological solutions to cope with the\never-increasing growth of transport, while at the same time improving their\nenvironmental footprint. An emerging technology that has the potential to\nsubstantially increase the efficiency of the multifaceted and interconnected\nport processes is the digital twin. Although digital twins have been\nsuccessfully integrated in many industries, there is still a lack of\ncross-domain understanding of what constitutes a digital twin. Furthermore, the\nimplementation of the digital twin in complex systems such as the port is still\nin its infancy. This paper attempts to fill this research gap by conducting an\nextensive cross-domain literature review of what constitutes a digital twin,\nkeeping in mind the extent to which the respective findings can be applied to\nthe port. It turns out that the digital twin of the port is most comparable to\ncomplex systems such as smart cities and supply chains, both in terms of its\nfunctional relevance as well as in terms of its requirements and\ncharacteristics. The conducted literature review, considering the different\nport processes and port characteristics, results in the identification of three\ncore requirements of a digital port twin, which are described in detail. These\ninclude situational awareness, comprehensive data analytics capabilities for\nintelligent decision making, and the provision of an interface to promote\nmulti-stakeholder governance and collaboration. Finally, specific operational\nscenarios are proposed on how the port's digital twin can contribute to energy\nsavings by improving the use of port resources, facilities and operations.",

It\nbuilds up a virtual world where we can live as a new role regardless of the\nrole we play in the physical world. However, building and operating this\nvirtual world will generate an extraordinary amount of carbon emissions for\ncomputing, communicating, displaying, and so on. This inevitably hinders the\nrealization of carbon neutrality as a priority of our society, adding heavy\nburden to our earth. In this survey, we first present a green viewpoint of the\nmetaverse by investigating the carbon issues in its three core layers, namely\nthe infrastructure layer, the interaction layer, and the economy layer, and\nestimate their carbon footprints in the near future. Next, we analyze a range\nof current and emerging applicable green techniques for the purpose of reducing\nenergy usage and carbon emissions of the metaverse, and discuss their\nlimitations in supporting metaverse workloads. Then, in view of these\nlimitations, we discuss important implications and bring forth several insights\nand future directions to make each metaverse layer greener. After that, we\ninvestigate green solutions from the governance perspective, including both\npublic policies in the physical world and regulation of users in the virtual\nworld, and propose an indicator Carbon Utility (CU) to quantify the service\nquality brought by an user activity per unit of carbon emissions. Finally, we\nidentify an issue for the metaverse as a whole and summarize three directions:\n(1) a comprehensive consideration of necessary performance metrics, (2) a\ncomprehensive consideration of involved layers and multiple internal\ncomponents, and (3) a new assessing, recording, and regulating mechanism on\ncarbon footprints of user activities. Our proposed quantitative indicator CU\nwould be helpful in regulating user activities in the metaverse world.",

Our model uses d choose 2 planes to represent a d-dimensional\nscene, providing a seamless way to go from static (d=3) to dynamic (d=4)\nscenes. This planar factorization makes adding dimension-specific priors easy,\ne.g. temporal smoothness and multi-resolution spatial structure, and induces a\nnatural decomposition of static and dynamic components of a scene. We use a\nlinear feature decoder with a learned color basis that yields similar\nperformance as a nonlinear black-box MLP decoder. Across a range of synthetic\nand real, static and dynamic, fixed and varying appearance scenes, k-planes\nyields competitive and often state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity with low\nmemory usage, achieving 1000x compression over a full 4D grid, and fast\noptimization with a pure PyTorch implementation.

    "abstract": "Computer-aided detection systems based on deep learning have shown great\npotential in breast cancer detection. However, the lack of domain\ngeneralization of artificial neural networks is an important obstacle to their\ndeployment in changing clinical environments. In this work, we explore the\ndomain generalization of deep learning methods for mass detection in digital\nmammography and analyze in-depth the sources of domain shift in a large-scale\nmulti-center setting. To this end, we compare the performance of eight\nstate-of-the-art detection methods, including Transformer-based models, trained\nin a single domain and tested in five unseen domains. Moreover, a single-source\nmass detection training pipeline is designed to improve the domain\ngeneralization without requiring images from the new domain. The results show\nthat our workflow generalizes better than state-of-the-art transfer\nlearning-based approaches in four out of five domains while reducing the domain\nshift caused by the different acquisition protocols and scanner manufacturers.\nSubsequently, an extensive analysis is performed to identify the covariate\nshifts with bigger effects on the detection performance, such as due to\ndifferences in patient age, breast density, mass size, and mass malignancy.\nUltimately, this comprehensive study provides key insights and best practices\nfor future research on domain generalization in deep learning-based breast\ncancer detection.",

The scalar function of choice is\n$\\Omega^{B_\\alpha}$ based on the velocity-gradient $\\Omega$ method known in\nresearch on classical flows. The Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is then used\nto analyze the $\\Omega^{B_\\alpha}$ scalar field.

    "abstract": "Motivation: Detection of structural variants (SV) from the alignment of\nsample DNA reads to the reference genome is an important problem in\nunderstanding human diseases. Long reads that can span repeat regions, along\nwith an accurate alignment of these long reads play an important role in\nidentifying novel SVs. Long read sequencers such as nanopore sequencing can\naddress this problem by providing very long reads but with high error rates,\nmaking accurate alignment challenging. Many errors induced by nanopore\nsequencing have a bias because of the physics of the sequencing process and\nproper utilization of these error characteristics can play an important role in\ndesigning a robust aligner for SV detection problems. In this paper, we design\nand evaluate HQAlign, an aligner for SV detection using nanopore sequenced\nreads. The key ideas of HQAlign include (i) using basecalled nanopore reads\nalong with the nanopore physics to improve alignments for SVs (ii)\nincorporating SV specific changes to the alignment pipeline (iii) adapting\nthese into existing state-of-the-art long read aligner pipeline, minimap2\n(v2.24), for efficient alignments.\nResults: We show that HQAlign captures about 4%-6% complementary SVs across\ndifferent datasets which are missed by minimap2 alignments while having a\nstandalone performance at par with minimap2 for real nanopore reads data. For\nthe common SV calls between HQAlign and minimap2, HQAlign improves the start\nand the end breakpoint accuracy for about 10%-50% of SVs across different\ndatasets. Moreover, HQAlign improves the alignment rate to 89.35% from minimap2\n85.64% for nanopore reads alignment to recent telomere-to-telomere CHM13\nassembly, and it improves to 86.65% from 83.48% for nanopore reads alignment to\nGRCh37 human genome.",

    "abstract": "Have you ever been troubled by the complexity and computational cost of SE(3)\nprotein structure modeling and been amazed by the simplicity and power of\nlanguage modeling? Recent work has shown promise in simplifying protein\nstructures as sequences of protein angles; therefore, language models could be\nused for unconstrained protein backbone generation. Unfortunately, such\nsimplification is unsuitable for the constrained protein inpainting problem,\nwhere the model needs to recover masked structures conditioned on unmasked\nones, as it dramatically increases the computing cost of geometric constraints.\nTo overcome this dilemma, we suggest inserting a hidden \\textbf{a}tomic\n\\textbf{d}irection \\textbf{s}pace (\\textbf{ADS}) upon the language model,\nconverting invariant backbone angles into equivalent direction vectors and\npreserving the simplicity, called Seq2Direct encoder ($\\text{Enc}_{s2d}$).\nGeometric constraints could be efficiently imposed on the newly introduced\ndirection space. A Direct2Seq decoder ($\\text{Dec}_{d2s}$) with mathematical\nguarantees is also introduced to develop a \\textbf{SDS}\n($\\text{Enc}_{s2d}$+$\\text{Dec}_{d2s}$) model. We apply the SDS model as the\ndenoising neural network during the conditional diffusion process, resulting in\na constrained generative model--\\textbf{DiffSDS}.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning is an increasingly popular approach to unsupervised\nlearning, achieving state-of-the-art results. A prevalent approach consists in\ncontrasting data points and noise points within a classification task: this\nrequires a good noise distribution which is notoriously hard to specify. While\na comprehensive theory is missing, it is widely assumed that the optimal noise\ndistribution should in practice be made equal to the data distribution, as in\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We here empirically and theoretically\nchallenge this assumption. We turn to Noise-Contrastive Estimation (NCE) which\ngrounds this self-supervised task as an estimation problem of an energy-based\nmodel of the data. This ties the optimality of the noise distribution to the\nsample efficiency of the estimator, which is rigorously defined as its\nasymptotic variance, or mean-squared error. In the special case where the\nnormalization constant only is unknown, we show that NCE recovers a family of\nImportance Sampling estimators for which the optimal noise is indeed equal to\nthe data distribution. However, in the general case where the energy is also\nunknown, we prove that the optimal noise density is the data density multiplied\nby a correction term based on the Fisher score. In particular, the optimal\nnoise distribution is different from the data distribution, and is even from a\ndifferent family. Nevertheless, we soberly conclude that the optimal noise may\nbe hard to sample from, and the gain in efficiency can be modest compared to\nchoosing the noise distribution equal to the data's.",

This framework addresses the problem of\nestimating tissue-specific thermodynamics in real-time, which would enable\naccurate prediction of thermal damage impact to the tissue and damage-conscious\nplanning of electrosurgical procedures. Our approach provides basic\nthermodynamic information such as thermal diffusivity, and also allows for\nobtaining the thermal relaxation time and a model of the heat source, yielding\nin real-time a controlled hyperbolic thermodynamics model. The latter accounts\nfor the finite thermal propagation time necessary for modeling of the\nelectrosurgical action, in which the probe motion speed often surpasses the\nspeed of thermal propagation in the tissue operated on. Our approach relies\nsolely on thermographer feedback and a knowledge of the power level and\nposition of the electrosurgical pencil, imposing only very minor adjustments to\nnormal electrosurgery to obtain a high-fidelity model of the tissue-probe\ninteraction. Our method is minimally invasive and can be performed in situ.

The objective of the present paper is\nto reduce the computational cost of implementing CWG with CFD, through the\nconstruction of long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. After training\nthe models with a limited quantity of simulations, the models can provide a\nlarger quantity of predictions to calculate the probability. The new framework\nis demonstrated with a 2-D midship section of the Office of Naval Research\nTumblehome (ONRT) hull in Sea State 7 and beam seas at zero speed. The new\nframework is able to produce predictions that are representative of a purely\nCFD-driven CWG framework, with two orders of magnitude of computational cost\nsavings.",

We focus\nparticularly on the US economy but the methodology can be applied also to other\neconomies. Specifically US economy has suffered a severe recession from 2008 to\n2010 which practically breaks out conventional econometrics model attempts.\nDeep learning has the advantage that it models all macro variables\nsimultaneously taking into account all interdependencies among them and\ndetecting non-linear patterns which cannot be easily addressed under a\nunivariate modelling framework. Our empirical results indicate that the deep\nlearning methods have a superior out-of-sample performance when compared to\ntraditional econometric techniques such as Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA).\nTherefore our results provide a concise view of a more robust method for\nassessing sovereign risk which is a crucial component in investment and\nmonetary decisions.",

    "abstract": "There is growing concern that male reproduction is affected by environmental\nchemicals. One way to determine the adverse effect of environmental pollutants\nis to use wild animals as monitors and evaluate testicular toxicity using\nhistopathology. Automated methods are necessary tools in the quantitative\nassessment of histopathology to overcome the subjectivity of manual evaluation\nand accelerate the process. We propose an automated method to process histology\nimages of testicular tissue. Segmenting the epithelial layer of the\nseminiferous tubule is a prerequisite for developing automated methods to\ndetect abnormalities in tissue. We suggest an encoder-decoder fully connected\nconvolutional neural network (F-CNN) model to segment the epithelial layer of\nthe seminiferous tubules in histological images. Using ResNet-34 modules in the\nencoder adds a shortcut mechanism to avoid the gradient vanishing and\naccelerate the network convergence. The squeeze & excitation (SE) attention\nblock is integrated into the encoding module improving the segmentation and\nlocalization of epithelium. We applied the proposed method for the 2-class\nproblem where the epithelial layer of the tubule is the target class. The\nf-score and IoU of the proposed method are 0.85 and 0.92. Although the proposed\nmethod is trained on a limited training set, it performs well on an independent\ndataset and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. The pretrained\nResNet-34 in the encoder and attention block suggested in the decoder result in\nbetter segmentation and generalization. The proposed method can be applied to\ntesticular tissue images from any mammalian species and can be used as the\nfirst part of a fully automated testicular tissue processing pipeline.

However, it is generally not known how to compute such quantities, since\nthe quantum channel coherent information is not additive for all channels,\nimplying that it must be maximized over an unbounded number of channel uses.\nThis leads to the phenomenon known as superadditivity, which refers to the fact\nthat the regularized coherent information of $n$ channel uses exceeds one-shot\ncoherent information. In this letter, we study how the gain in quantum capacity\nof qudit depolarizing channels relates to the dimension of the systems\nconsidered. We make use of an argument based on the no-cloning bound in order\nto proof that the possible superaditive effects decrease as a function of the\ndimension for such family of channels. In addition, we prove that the capacity\nof the qudit depolarizing channel coincides with the coherent information when\n$d\\rightarrow\\infty$.

Our work opens up a new research direction of utilizing\nphotonic computing techniques for processing large-scale EEG signals in\npromoting its broader applications.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether a deep learning model can detect Covid-19 from\ndisruptions in the human body's physiological (heart rate) and rest-activity\nrhythms (rhythmic dysregulation) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We propose\nCovidRhythm, a novel Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Network with Multi-Head\nSelf-Attention (MHSA) that combines sensor and rhythmic features extracted from\nheart rate and activity (steps) data gathered passively using consumer-grade\nsmart wearable to predict Covid-19. A total of 39 features were extracted\n(standard deviation, mean, min/max/avg length of sedentary and active bouts)\nfrom wearable sensor data. Biobehavioral rhythms were modeled using nine\nparameters (mesor, amplitude, acrophase, and intra-daily variability). These\nfeatures were then input to CovidRhythm for predicting Covid-19 in the\nincubation phase (one day before biological symptoms manifest). A combination\nof sensor and biobehavioral rhythm features achieved the highest AUC-ROC of\n0.79 [Sensitivity = 0.69, Specificity=0.89, F$_{0.1}$ = 0.76], outperforming\nprior approaches in discriminating Covid-positive patients from healthy\ncontrols using 24 hours of historical wearable physiological. Rhythmic features\nwere the most predictive of Covid-19 infection when utilized either alone or in\nconjunction with sensor features. Sensor features predicted healthy subjects\nbest. Circadian rest-activity rhythms that combine 24h activity and sleep\ninformation were the most disrupted. CovidRhythm demonstrates that\nbiobehavioral rhythms derived from consumer-grade wearable data can facilitate\ntimely Covid-19 detection. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first\nto detect Covid-19 using deep learning and biobehavioral rhythms features\nderived from consumer-grade wearable data.",

    "abstract": "The connectivity of public-safety mobile users (MU) in the co-existence of a\npublic-safety network (PSN), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and LTE-based\nrailway networks (LRN) needs a thorough investigation. UAVs are deployed as\nmobile base stations (BSs) for cell-edge coverage enhancement for MU. The\nco-existence of heterogeneous networks gives rise to the issue of co-channel\ninterference due to the utilization of the same frequency band. By considering\nboth sharing and non-sharing of radio access channels (RAC), we analyze\nco-channel interference in the downlink system of PSN, UAV, and LRN. As the LRN\ncontrol signal demands high reliability and low latency, we provide higher\npriority to LRN users when allocating resources from the LRN RAC shared with\nMUs. Moreover, UAVs are deployed at the cell edge to increase the performance\nof cell-edge users. Therefore, interference control techniques enable LRN, PSN,\nand UAVs to cohabit in a scenario of sharing RAC. By offloading more PSN UEs to\nthe LRN or UAVs, the resource utilization of the LRN and UAVs BSs is enhanced.\nIn this paper, we aim to adopt deep learning (DL) based on enhanced\ninter-cell-interference coordination (eICIC) and further enhanced ICIC (FeICIC)\nstrategies to deal with the interference from the PSN to the LRN and UAVs.\nAmong LRN, PSN BS, and UAVs, a DL-based coordinated multipoint (CoMP) link\ntechnique is utilized to enhance the performance of PSN MUs. Therefore, if\nradio access channels are shared, utilization of DL-based FeICIC and CoMP for\ncoordinated scheduling gives the best performance.",

    "abstract": "Neural network-based models have found wide use in automatic long-term\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, such black box models are inadequate\nfor analysing physiological signals where credibility and interpretability are\ncrucial. Indeed, how to make ECG analysis transparent is still an open problem.\nIn this study, we develop a Tsetlin machine (TM) based architecture for\npremature ventricular contraction (PVC) identification by analysing long-term\nECG signals. The architecture is transparent by describing patterns directly\nwith logical AND rules. To validate the accuracy of our approach, we compare\nthe TM performance with those of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our\nnumerical results demonstrate that TM provides comparable performance with CNNs\non the MIT-BIH database. To validate interpretability, we provide explanatory\ndiagrams that show how TM makes the PVC identification from confirming and\ninvalidating patterns. We argue that these are compatible with medical\nknowledge so that they can be readily understood and verified by a medical\ndoctor. Accordingly, we believe this study paves the way for machine learning\n(ML) for ECG analysis in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Histopathology image synthesis aims to address the data shortage issue in\ntraining deep learning approaches for accurate cancer detection. However,\nexisting methods struggle to produce realistic images that have accurate nuclei\nboundaries and less artifacts, which limits the application in downstream\ntasks. To address the challenges, we propose a novel approach that enhances the\nquality of synthetic images by using nuclei topology and contour\nregularization. The proposed approach uses the skeleton map of nuclei to\nintegrate nuclei topology and separate touching nuclei. In the loss function,\nwe propose two new contour regularization terms that enhance the contrast\nbetween contour and non-contour pixels and increase the similarity between\ncontour pixels. We evaluate the proposed approach on the two datasets using\nimage quality metrics and a downstream task (nuclei segmentation). The proposed\napproach outperforms Sharp-GAN in all four image quality metrics on two\ndatasets. By integrating 6k synthetic images from the proposed approach into\ntraining, a nuclei segmentation model achieves the state-of-the-art\nsegmentation performance on TNBC dataset and its detection quality (DQ),\nsegmentation quality (SQ), panoptic quality (PQ), and aggregated Jaccard index\n(AJI) is 0.855, 0.863, 0.691, and 0.683, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal systems need to process temporal signals. We here show how\nhigher-order temporal (co-)fluctuations can be employed to represent and\nprocess information. Concretely, we demonstrate that a simple biologically\ninspired feedforward neuronal model is able to extract information from up to\nthe third order cumulant to perform time series classification. This model\nrelies on a weighted linear summation of synaptic inputs followed by a\nnonlinear gain function. Training both - the synaptic weights and the nonlinear\ngain function - exposes how the non-linearity allows for the transfer of higher\norder correlations to the mean, which in turn enables the synergistic use of\ninformation encoded in multiple cumulants to maximize the classification\naccuracy. The approach is demonstrated both on a synthetic and on real world\ndatasets of multivariate time series. Moreover, we show that the biologically\ninspired architecture makes better use of the number of trainable parameters as\ncompared to a classical machine-learning scheme. Our findings emphasize the\nbenefit of biological neuronal architectures, paired with dedicated learning\nalgorithms, for the processing of information embedded in higher-order\nstatistical cumulants of temporal (co-)fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "According to the evolutionary death-birth protocol, a player is chosen\nrandomly to die and neighbors compete for the available position proportional\nto their fitness. Hence, the status of the focal player is completely ignored\nand has no impact on the strategy update. In this work, we revisit and\ngeneralize this rule by introducing a weight factor to compare the payoff\nvalues of the focal and invading neighbors. By means of evolutionary graph\ntheory, we analyze the model on joint transitive graphs to explore the possible\nconsequences of the presence of a weight factor. We find that focal weight\nalways hinders cooperation under weak selection strength. Surprisingly, the\nresults show a non-trivial tipping point of the weight factor where the\nthreshold of cooperation success shifts from positive to negative infinity.\nOnce focal weight exceeds this tipping point, cooperation becomes unreachable.\nOur theoretical predictions are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations on a\nsquare lattice of different sizes.

This contribution investigates the effect of the temporal\nand directional density of sound events on listener envelopment and engulfment.\nA spatial granular synthesis technique is used to precisely control the\ntemporal and directional density of sound events. Experimental results indicate\nthat a directionally uniform distribution of sound events at time intervals\n$\\Delta t < 20$ milliseconds is required to elicit a sensation of diffuse\nenvelopment, whereas longer time intervals lead to localized auditory events.\nIt shows that elevated loudspeaker layers do not increase envelopment, but\ncontribute specifically to listener engulfment.
