    "abstract": "Creating compelling captions for data visualizations has been a longstanding\nchallenge. Visualization researchers are typically untrained in journalistic\nreporting and hence the captions that are placed below data visualizations tend\nto be not overly engaging and rather just stick to basic observations about the\ndata. In this work we explore the opportunities offered by the newly emerging\ncrop of large language models (LLM) which use sophisticated deep learning\ntechnology to produce human-like prose. We ask, can these powerful software\ndevices be purposed to produce engaging captions for generic data\nvisualizations like a scatterplot. It turns out that the key challenge lies in\ndesigning the most effective prompt for the LLM, a task called prompt\nengineering. We report on first experiments using the popular LLM GPT-3 and\ndeliver some promising results.",

    "title": "Structural State Translation: Condition Transfer between Civil  Structures Using Domain-Generalization for Structural Health Monitoring",
    "abstract": "Using Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems with extensive sensing\narrangements on every civil structure can be costly and impractical. Various\nconcepts have been introduced to alleviate such difficulties, such as\nPopulation-based SHM (PBSHM). Nevertheless, the studies presented in the\nliterature do not adequately address the challenge of accessing the information\non different structural states (conditions) of dissimilar civil structures. The\nstudy herein introduces a novel framework named Structural State Translation\n(SST), which aims to estimate the response data of different civil structures\nbased on the information obtained from a dissimilar structure. SST can be\ndefined as Translating a state of one civil structure to another state after\ndiscovering and learning the domain-invariant representation in the source\ndomains of a dissimilar civil structure. SST employs a Domain-Generalized\nCycle-Generative (DGCG) model to learn the domain-invariant representation in\nthe acceleration datasets obtained from a numeric bridge structure that is in\ntwo different structural conditions. In other words, the model is tested on\nthree dissimilar numeric bridge models to translate their structural\nconditions. The evaluation results of SST via Mean Magnitude-Squared Coherence\n(MMSC) and modal identifiers showed that the translated bridge states\n(synthetic states) are significantly similar to the real ones. As such, the\nminimum and maximum average MMSC values of real and translated bridge states\nare 91.2% and 97.1%, the minimum and the maximum difference in natural\nfrequencies are 5.71% and 0%, and the minimum and maximum Modal Assurance\nCriterion (MAC) values are 0.998 and 0.870. This study is critical for data\nscarcity and PBSHM, as it demonstrates that it is possible to obtain data from\nstructures while the structure is actually in a different condition or state.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are found to be vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks, and various methods have been proposed for the defense. Among these\nmethods, adversarial training has been drawing increasing attention because of\nits simplicity and effectiveness. However, the performance of the adversarial\ntraining is greatly limited by the architectures of target DNNs, which often\nmakes the resulting DNNs with poor accuracy and unsatisfactory robustness. To\naddress this problem, we propose DSARA to automatically search for the neural\narchitectures that are accurate and robust after adversarial training. In\nparticular, we design a novel cell-based search space specially for adversarial\ntraining, which improves the accuracy and the robustness upper bound of the\nsearched architectures by carefully designing the placement of the cells and\nthe proportional relationship of the filter numbers. Then we propose a\ntwo-stage search strategy to search for both accurate and robust neural\narchitectures. At the first stage, the architecture parameters are optimized to\nminimize the adversarial loss, which makes full use of the effectiveness of the\nadversarial training in enhancing the robustness. At the second stage, the\narchitecture parameters are optimized to minimize both the natural loss and the\nadversarial loss utilizing the proposed multi-objective adversarial training\nmethod, so that the searched neural architectures are both accurate and robust.\nWe evaluate the proposed algorithm under natural data and various adversarial\nattacks, which reveals the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both\naccurate and robust architectures. We also conclude that accurate and robust\nneural architectures tend to deploy very different structures near the input\nand the output, which has great practical significance on both hand-crafting\nand automatically designing of accurate and robust neural architectures.",

    "abstract": "Ensemble learning combines results from multiple machine learning models in\norder to provide a better and optimised predictive model with reduced bias,\nvariance and improved predictions. However, in federated learning it is not\nfeasible to apply centralised ensemble learning directly due to privacy\nconcerns. Hence, a mechanism is required to combine results of local models to\nproduce a global model. Most distributed consensus algorithms, such as\nByzantine fault tolerance (BFT), do not normally perform well in such\napplications. This is because, in such methods predictions of some of the peers\nare disregarded, so a majority of peers can win without even considering other\npeers' decisions. Additionally, the confidence score of the result of each peer\nis not normally taken into account, although it is an important feature to\nconsider for ensemble learning. Moreover, the problem of a tie event is often\nleft un-addressed by methods such as BFT. To fill these research gaps, we\npropose PoSw (Proof of Swarm), a novel distributed consensus algorithm for\nensemble learning in a federated setting, which was inspired by particle swarm\nbased algorithms for solving optimisation problems. The proposed algorithm is\ntheoretically proved to always converge in a relatively small number of steps\nand has mechanisms to resolve tie events while trying to achieve sub-optimum\nsolutions. We experimentally validated the performance of the proposed\nalgorithm using ECG classification as an example application in healthcare,\nshowing that the ensemble learning model outperformed all local models and even\nthe FL-based global model. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed algorithm\nis the first attempt to make consensus over the output results of distributed\nmodels trained using federated learning.",

    "abstract": "State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence\nmodeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language\nmodeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead\nof quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware\nutilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity\ngap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the\nhardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language\nmodeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that\nexisting SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the\nsequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on\nlanguage modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed\nfor these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes\nwithin 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid\n125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers\nsurprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to\nimprove the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose\nFlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on\nsequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that\nexploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences.\nFlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows\nhybrid language models to generate text 1.6$\\times$ faster than Transformers.\nUsing FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 1.3B\nparameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower\nperplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and\nfew-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.",

    "abstract": "User equipment is one of the main bottlenecks facing the gaming industry\nnowadays. The extremely realistic games which are currently available trigger\nhigh computational requirements of the user devices to run games. As a\nconsequence, the game industry has proposed the concept of Cloud Gaming, a\nparadigm that improves gaming experience in reduced hardware devices. To this\nend, games are hosted on remote servers, relegating users' devices to play only\nthe role of a peripheral for interacting with the game. However, this paradigm\noverloads the communication links connecting the users with the cloud.\nTherefore, service experience becomes highly dependent on network connectivity.\nTo overcome this, Cloud Gaming will be boosted by the promised performance of\n5G and future 6G networks, together with the flexibility provided by mobility\nin multi-RAT scenarios, such as WiFi. In this scope, the present work proposes\na framework for measuring and estimating the main E2E metrics of the Cloud\nGaming service, namely KQIs. In addition, different machine learning techniques\nare assessed for predicting KQIs related to Cloud Gaming user's experience. To\nthis end, the main key quality indicators (KQIs) of the service such as input\nlag, freeze percent or perceived video frame rate are collected in a real\nenvironment. Based on these, results show that machine learning techniques\nprovide a good estimation of these indicators solely from network-based\nmetrics.

    "abstract": "Inferring knowledge from clinical trials using knowledge graph embedding is\nan emerging area. However, customizing graph embeddings for different use cases\nremains a significant challenge. We propose custom2vec, an algorithmic\nframework to customize graph embeddings by incorporating user preferences in\ntraining the embeddings. It captures user preferences by adding custom nodes\nand links derived from manually vetted results of a separate information\nretrieval method. We propose a joint learning objective to preserve the\noriginal network structure while incorporating the user's custom annotations.\nWe hypothesize that the custom training improves user-expected predictions, for\nexample, in link prediction tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\ncustom2vec for clinical trials related to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\nwith two customization scenarios: recommending immuno-oncology trials\nevaluating PD-1 inhibitors and exploring similar trials that compare new\ntherapies with a standard of care. The results show that custom2vec training\nachieves better performance than the conventional training methods. Our\napproach is a novel way to customize knowledge graph embeddings and enable more\naccurate recommendations and predictions.",

Recent\napproaches postulate that powerful architectures have the capacity to learn\nfeature representations invariant to nuisance factors, by training them with\nlosses that minimize intra-class variance and maximize inter-class separation,\nwithout modeling nuisance factors explicitly. The dominant approaches use\neither a discriminative loss with margin, like the softmax loss with the\nadditive angular margin, or a metric learning loss, like the triplet loss with\nbatch hard mining of triplets. Since the softmax imposes feature normalization,\nit limits the gradient flow supervising the feature embedding. We address this\nby joining the losses and leveraging the triplet loss as a proxy for the\nmissing gradients. We further improve invariance to nuisance factors by adding\nthe discriminative task of predicting attributes. Our extensive evaluation\nhighlights that when only a holistic representation is learned, we consistently\noutperform the state-of-the-art on the three most challenging datasets.

Unfortunately,\narchitectures designed for image learning are often not ready or optimal for\nnon-image data without considering data-specific learning requirements. In this\npaper, we take a data-centric view to argue that deep image embedding\nclustering methods are not equally effective on heterogeneous tabular data\nsets. This paper performs one of the first studies on deep embedding clustering\nof seven tabular data sets using six state-of-the-art baseline methods proposed\nfor image data sets. Our results reveal that the traditional clustering of\ntabular data ranks second out of eight methods and is superior to most deep\nembedding clustering baselines. Our observation is in line with the recent\nliterature that traditional machine learning of tabular data is still a\ncompetitive approach against deep learning. Although surprising to many deep\nlearning researchers, traditional clustering methods can be competitive\nbaselines for tabular data, and outperforming these baselines remains a\nchallenge for deep embedding clustering.

    "abstract": "Function approximation has enabled remarkable advances in applying\nreinforcement learning (RL) techniques in environments with high-dimensional\ninputs, such as images, in an end-to-end fashion, mapping such inputs directly\nto low-level control. Nevertheless, these have proved vulnerable to small\nadversarial input perturbations. A number of approaches for improving or\ncertifying robustness of end-to-end RL to adversarial perturbations have\nemerged as a result, focusing on cumulative reward. However, what is often at\nstake in adversarial scenarios is the violation of fundamental properties, such\nas safety, rather than the overall reward that combines safety with efficiency.\nMoreover, properties such as safety can only be defined with respect to true\nstate, rather than the high-dimensional raw inputs to end-to-end policies. To\ndisentangle nominal efficiency and adversarial safety, we situate RL in\ndeterministic partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with the\ngoal of maximizing cumulative reward subject to safety constraints. We then\npropose a partially-supervised reinforcement learning (PSRL) framework that\ntakes advantage of an additional assumption that the true state of the POMDP is\nknown at training time. We present the first approach for certifying safety of\nPSRL policies under adversarial input perturbations, and two adversarial\ntraining approaches that make direct use of PSRL. Our experiments demonstrate\nboth the efficacy of the proposed approach for certifying safety in adversarial\nenvironments, and the value of the PSRL framework coupled with adversarial\ntraining in improving certified safety while preserving high nominal reward and\nhigh-quality predictions of true state.",

TAToo\njointly tracks the rigid 3D motion of patient skull and surgical drill from\nstereo microscopic videos. TAToo estimates motion via an iterative optimization\nprocess in an end-to-end differentiable form. For robust tracking performance,\nTAToo adopts a probabilistic formulation and enforces geometric constraints on\nthe object level. Results: We validate TAToo on both simulation data, where\nground truth motion is available, as well as on anthropomorphic phantom data,\nwhere optical tracking provides a strong baseline. We report sub-millimeter and\nmillimeter inter-frame tracking accuracy for skull and drill, respectively,\nwith rotation errors below 1{\\deg}. We further illustrate how TAToo may be used\nin a surgical navigation setting. Conclusion: We present TAToo, which\nsimultaneously tracks the surgical tool and the patient anatomy in skull-base\nsurgery. TAToo directly predicts the motion from surgical videos, without the\nneed of any markers. Our results show that the performance of TAToo compares\nfavorably to competing approaches. Future work will include fine-tuning of our\ndepth network to reach a 1 mm clinical accuracy goal desired for surgical\napplications in the skull base.",

    "abstract": "The increase in the adoption of blockchain technology in different\napplication domains e.g., healthcare systems, supplychain management, has\nraised the demand for a data query mechanism on blockchain. Since current\nblockchain systems lack the support for querying data with embedded security\nand privacy guarantees, there exists inherent security and privacy concerns on\nthose systems. In particular, existing systems require users to submit queries\nto blockchain operators (e.g., a node validator) in plaintext. This directly\njeopardizes users' privacy as the submitted queries may contain sensitive\ninformation, e.g., location or gender preferences, that the users may not be\ncomfortable sharing. On the other hand, currently, the only way for users to\nensure integrity of the query result is to maintain the entire blockchain\ndatabase and perform the queries locally. Doing so incurs high storage and\ncomputational costs on the users, precluding this approach to be practically\ndeployable on common light-weight devices (e.g., smartphones). To this end,\nthis paper proposes $\\pi$QLB, a query language for blockchain systems that\nensures both confidentiality of query inputs and integrity of query results.\nAdditionally, $\\pi$QLB enables SQL-like queries over the blockchain data by\nintroducing relational data semantics into the existing blockchain database.\n$\\pi$QLB has applied the recent cryptography primitive, i.e., function secret\nsharing (FSS), to achieve confidentiality. To support integrity, we extend the\ntraditional FSS setting in such a way that integrity of FSS results can be\nefficiently verified. Successful verification indicates absence of malicious\nbehaviors on the servers, allowing the user to establish trust from the result.\nTo the best of our knowledge, $\\pi$QLB is the first query model designed for\nblockchain databases with support for confidentiality, integrity, and SQL-like\nqueries.",

To this\nend, this paper investigates SemCom from a networking perspective, where two\nfundamental problems of user association (UA) and bandwidth allocation (BA) are\nsystematically addressed in the SC-Net. First, considering varying knowledge\nmatching states between mobile users and associated base stations, we identify\ntwo general SC-Net scenarios, namely perfect knowledge matching-based SC-Net\nand imperfect knowledge matching-based SC-Net. Afterward, for each SC-Net\nscenario, we describe its distinctive semantic channel model from the semantic\ninformation theory perspective, whereby a concept of bit-rate-to-message-rate\ntransformation is developed along with a new semantics-level metric, namely\nsystem throughput in message (STM), to measure the overall network performance.\nIn this way, we then formulate a joint STM-maximization problem of UA and BA\nfor each SC-Net scenario, followed by a corresponding optimal solution\nproposed.

These discrete gradient dynamics are\nrelatively small but not infinitesimal, thus fitting well with the practical\nimplementation of neural networks. Currently, discrete gradient dynamics\nanalysis has been successfully applied to shallow networks but encounters the\ndifficulty of complex computation for deep networks. In this work, we introduce\nanother discrete gradient dynamics approach to explain implicit regularization,\ni.e. landscape analysis. It mainly focuses on gradient regions, such as saddle\npoints and local minima. We theoretically establish the connection between\nsaddle point escaping (SPE) stages and the matrix rank in DMF. We prove that,\nfor a rank-R matrix reconstruction, DMF will converge to a second-order\ncritical point after R stages of SPE. This conclusion is further experimentally\nverified on a low-rank matrix reconstruction problem. This work provides a new\ntheory to analyze implicit regularization in deep learning.",

    "abstract": "Video semantic segmentation (VSS) is beneficial for dealing with dynamic\nscenes due to the continuous property of the real-world environment. On the one\nhand, some methods alleviate the predicted inconsistent problem between\ncontinuous frames. On the other hand, other methods employ the previous frame\nas the prior information to assist in segmenting the current frame. Although\nthe previous methods achieve superior performances on the independent and\nidentically distributed (i.i.d) data, they can not generalize well on other\nunseen domains. Thus, we explore a new task, the video generalizable semantic\nsegmentation (VGSS) task that considers both continuous frames and domain\ngeneralization. In this paper, we propose a class-wise non-salient region\ngeneralized (CNSG) framework for the VGSS task. Concretely, we first define the\nclass-wise non-salient feature, which describes features of the class-wise\nnon-salient region that carry more generalizable information. Then, we propose\na class-wise non-salient feature reasoning strategy to select and enhance the\nmost generalized channels adaptively. Finally, we propose an inter-frame\nnon-salient centroid alignment loss to alleviate the predicted inconsistent\nproblem in the VGSS task.

Furthermore, users are typically interested in finding\n``semantically'' joinable tables: with columns that can be transformed to\nbecome joinable even if they are not joinable as currently represented in the\ndata store. We present WarpGate, a system prototype for data discovery over\ncloud data warehouses.

In this paper, we collect and\ndissect recent advances on transforming RL by transformer (transformer-based RL\nor TRL), in order to explore its development trajectory and future trend. We\ngroup existing developments in two categories: architecture enhancement and\ntrajectory optimization, and examine the main applications of TRL in robotic\nmanipulation, text-based games, navigation and autonomous driving. For\narchitecture enhancement, these methods consider how to apply the powerful\ntransformer structure to RL problems under the traditional RL framework, which\nmodel agents and environments much more precisely than deep RL methods, but\nthey are still limited by the inherent defects of traditional RL algorithms,\nsuch as bootstrapping and \"deadly triad\".

For\ninstance, after reducing over 40x MACs and 80x parameters of CycleGAN, we well\ndecrease FID metric from 61.53 to 48.24 while the current SoTA method merely\nhas 51.92.

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become commonplace to solve routine everyday\ntasks. Because of the exponential growth in medical imaging data volume and\ncomplexity, the workload on radiologists is steadily increasing. We project\nthat the gap between the number of imaging exams and the number of expert\nradiologist readers required to cover this increase will continue to expand,\nconsequently introducing a demand for AI-based tools that improve the\nefficiency with which radiologists can comfortably interpret these exams. AI\nhas been shown to improve efficiency in medical-image generation, processing,\nand interpretation, and a variety of such AI models have been developed across\nresearch labs worldwide. However, very few of these, if any, find their way\ninto routine clinical use, a discrepancy that reflects the divide between AI\nresearch and successful AI translation. To address the barrier to clinical\ndeployment, we have formed MONAI Consortium, an open-source community which is\nbuilding standards for AI deployment in healthcare institutions, and developing\ntools and infrastructure to facilitate their implementation. This report\nrepresents several years of weekly discussions and hands-on problem solving\nexperience by groups of industry experts and clinicians in the MONAI\nConsortium. We identify barriers between AI-model development in research labs\nand subsequent clinical deployment and propose solutions. Our report provides\nguidance on processes which take an imaging AI model from development to\nclinical implementation in a healthcare institution. We discuss various AI\nintegration points in a clinical Radiology workflow. We also present a taxonomy\nof Radiology AI use-cases. Through this report, we intend to educate the\nstakeholders in healthcare and AI (AI researchers, radiologists, imaging\ninformaticists, and regulators) about cross-disciplinary challenges and\npossible solutions.",

    "abstract": "Recently, great progress has been made in single-image super-resolution\n(SISR) based on deep learning technology. However, the existing methods usually\nrequire a large computational cost. Meanwhile, the activation function will\ncause some features of the intermediate layer to be lost. Therefore, it is a\nchallenge to make the model lightweight while reducing the impact of\nintermediate feature loss on the reconstruction quality. In this paper, we\npropose a Feature Interaction Weighted Hybrid Network (FIWHN) to alleviate the\nabove problem. Specifically, FIWHN consists of a series of novel Wide-residual\nDistillation Interaction Blocks (WDIB) as the backbone, where every third WDIBs\nform a Feature shuffle Weighted Group (FSWG) by mutual information mixing and\nfusion. In addition, to mitigate the adverse effects of intermediate feature\nloss on the reconstruction results, we introduced a well-designed Wide\nConvolutional Residual Weighting (WCRW) and Wide Identical Residual Weighting\n(WIRW) units in WDIB, and effectively cross-fused features of different\nfinenesses through a Wide-residual Distillation Connection (WRDC) framework and\na Self-Calibrating Fusion (SCF) unit. Finally, to complement the global\nfeatures lacking in the CNN model, we introduced the Transformer into our model\nand explored a new way of combining the CNN and Transformer. Extensive\nquantitative and qualitative experiments on low-level and high-level tasks show\nthat our proposed FIWHN can achieve a good balance between performance and\nefficiency, and is more conducive to downstream tasks to solve problems in\nlow-pixel scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Aligning users across networks using graph representation learning has been\nfound effective where the alignment is accomplished in a low-dimensional\nembedding space. Yet, achieving highly precise alignment is still challenging,\nespecially when nodes with long-range connectivity to the labeled anchors are\nencountered. To alleviate this limitation, we purposefully designed WL-Align\nwhich adopts a regularized representation learning framework to learn\ndistinctive node representations. It extends the Weisfeiler-Lehman Isormorphism\nTest and learns the alignment in alternating phases of \"across-network\nWeisfeiler-Lehman relabeling\" and \"proximity-preserving representation\nlearning\". The across-network Weisfeiler-Lehman relabeling is achieved through\niterating the anchor-based label propagation and a similarity-based hashing to\nexploit the known anchors' connectivity to different nodes in an efficient and\nrobust manner. The representation learning module preserves the second-order\nproximity within individual networks and is regularized by the across-network\nWeisfeiler-Lehman hash labels. Extensive experiments on real-world and\nsynthetic datasets have demonstrated that our proposed WL-Align outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements in the\n\"exact matching\" scenario.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of smart manufacturing, edge computing-oriented\nmicroservice platforms are emerging as an important part of production control.\nIn the containerized deployment of microservices, layer sharing can reduce the\nhuge bandwidth consumption caused by image pulling, and chain sharing can\nreduce communication overhead caused by communication between microservices.\nThe two sharing methods use the characteristics of each microservice to share\nresources during deployment. However, due to the limited resources of edge\nservers, it is difficult to meet the optimization goals of the two methods at\nthe same time. Therefore, it is of critical importance to realize the\nimprovement of service response efficiency by balancing the two sharing\nmethods. This paper studies the optimal microservice deployment strategy that\ncan balance layer sharing and chain sharing of microservices. We build a\nproblem that minimizes microservice image pull delay and communication overhead\nand transform the problem into a linearly constrained integer quadratic\nprogramming problem through model reconstruction. A deployment strategy is\nobtained through the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed deployment strategy can balance the two resource\nsharing methods. When the two sharing methods are equally considered, the\naverage image pull delay can be reduced to 65% of the baseline, and the average\ncommunication overhead can be reduced to 30% of the baseline.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a learned hierarchical B-frame coding scheme in\nresponse to the Grand Challenge on Neural Network-based Video Coding at ISCAS\n2023. We address specifically three issues, including (1) B-frame coding, (2)\nYUV 4:2:0 coding, and (3) content-adaptive variable-rate coding with only one\nsingle model. Most learned video codecs operate internally in the RGB domain\nfor P-frame coding. B-frame coding for YUV 4:2:0 content is largely\nunder-explored. In addition, while there have been prior works on variable-rate\ncoding with conditional convolution, most of them fail to consider the content\ninformation. We build our scheme on conditional augmented normalized flows\n(CANF). It features conditional motion and inter-frame codecs for efficient\nB-frame coding. To cope with YUV 4:2:0 content, two conditional inter-frame\ncodecs are used to process the Y and UV components separately, with the coding\nof the UV components conditioned additionally on the Y component. Moreover, we\nintroduce adaptive feature modulation in every convolutional layer, taking into\naccount both the content information and the coding levels of B-frames to\nachieve content-adaptive variable-rate coding. Experimental results show that\nour model outperforms x265 and the winner of last year's challenge on commonly\nused datasets in terms of PSNR-YUV.",

TensorFHE utilizes Tensor Core\nUnits (TCUs) to boost the computation of Number Theoretic Transform (NTT),\nwhich is the part of FHE with highest time-cost. Moreover, TensorFHE focuses on\nperforming as many FHE operations as possible in a certain time period rather\nthan reducing the latency of one operation.

    "abstract": "The counting task, which plays a fundamental rule in numerous applications\n(e.g., crowd counting, traffic statistics), aims to predict the number of\nobjects with various densities. Existing object counting tasks are designed for\na single object class. However, it is inevitable to encounter newly coming data\nwith new classes in our real world. We name this scenario as \\textit{evolving\nobject counting}. In this paper, we build the first evolving object counting\ndataset and propose a unified object counting network as the first attempt to\naddress this task. The proposed model consists of two key components: a\nclass-agnostic mask module and a class-increment module. The class-agnostic\nmask module learns generic object occupation prior via predicting a\nclass-agnostic binary mask (e.g., 1 denotes there exists an object at the\nconsidering position in an image and 0 otherwise). The class-increment module\nis used to handle new coming classes and provides discriminative class guidance\nfor density map prediction. The combined outputs of class-agnostic mask module\nand image feature extractor are used to predict the final density map. When new\nclasses come, we first add new neural nodes into the last regression and\nclassification layers of this module. Then, instead of retraining the model\nfrom scratch, we utilize knowledge distilling to help the model remember what\nhave already learned about previous object classes. We also employ a support\nsample bank to store a small number of typical training samples of each class,\nwhich are used to prevent the model from forgetting key information of old\ndata. With this design, our model can efficiently and effectively adapt to new\ncoming classes while keeping good performance on already seen data without\nlarge-scale retraining. Extensive experiments on the collected dataset\ndemonstrate the favorable performance.",

    "abstract": "Language models have become increasingly popular in recent years for tasks\nlike information retrieval. As use-cases become oriented toward specific\ndomains, fine-tuning becomes default for standard performance. To fine-tune\nthese models for specific tasks and datasets, it is necessary to carefully tune\nthe model's hyperparameters and training techniques. In this paper, we present\nan in-depth analysis of the performance of four transformer-based language\nmodels on the task of biomedical information retrieval. The models we consider\nare DeepMind's RETRO (7B parameters), GPT-J (6B parameters), GPT-3 (175B\nparameters), and BLOOM (176B parameters). We compare their performance on the\nbasis of relevance, accuracy, and interpretability, using a large corpus of\n480000 research papers on protein structure/function prediction as our dataset.\nOur findings suggest that smaller models, with <10B parameters and fine-tuned\non domain-specific datasets, tend to outperform larger language models on\nhighly specific questions in terms of accuracy, relevancy, and interpretability\nby a significant margin (+50% on average). However, larger models do provide\ngenerally better results on broader prompts.",

The forward-generated trajectories give the\nagent little guidance, so the agent can explore as much as possible. While the\nappreciation of reinforcement learning comes from enough exploration, this\ngives the trade-off of losing sample efficiency. The sampling efficiency is an\nimportant factor that decides the performance of the algorithm. Past tasks use\nreward shaping techniques and changing the structure of the network to increase\nsample efficiency, however these methods require many steps to implement. In\nthis work, we propose novel reverse curriculum reinforcement learning. Reverse\ncurriculum learning starts training the agent using the backward trajectory of\nthe episode rather than the original forward trajectory. This gives the agent a\nstrong reward signal, so the agent can learn in a more sample-efficient manner.\nMoreover, our method only requires a minor change in algorithm, which is\nreversing the order of trajectory before training the agent.

    "abstract": "Transformers are becoming increasingly popular due to their superior\nperformance over conventional convolutional neural networks(CNNs). However,\ntransformers usually require a much larger amount of memory to train than CNNs,\nwhich prevents their application in many low resource settings. Local learning,\nwhich divides the network into several distinct modules and trains them\nindividually, is a promising alternative to the end-to-end (E2E) training\napproach to reduce the amount of memory for training and to increase\nparallelism. This paper is the first to apply Local Learning on transformers\nfor this purpose. The standard CNN-based local learning method, InfoPro [32],\nreconstructs the input images for each module in a CNN. However, reconstructing\nthe entire image does not generalize well. In this paper, we propose a new\nmechanism for each local module, where instead of reconstructing the entire\nimage, we reconstruct its input features, generated from previous modules. We\nevaluate our approach on 4 commonly used datasets and 3 commonly used decoder\nstructures on Swin-Tiny. The experiments show that our approach outperforms\nInfoPro-Transformer, the InfoPro with Transfomer backbone we introduced, by at\nup to 0.58% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10 and SVHN datasets, while using up to\n12% less memory.

The agent\nonly knows where the goal state is when it reaches it. How do we reach this\ngoal while moving only a small distance? This problem seems hopeless, even on\ntrees of bounded degree, unless we give the agent some help. This setting with\n''help'' often arises in exploring large search spaces (e.g., huge game trees)\nwhere we assume access to some score/quality function for each node, which we\nuse to guide us towards the goal. In our case, we assume the help comes in the\nform of distance predictions: each node $v$ provides a prediction $f(v)$ of its\ndistance to the goal vertex. Naturally if these predictions are correct, we can\nreach the goal along a shortest path. What if the predictions are unreliable\nand some of them are erroneous? Can we get an algorithm whose performance\nrelates to the error of the predictions?\nIn this work, we consider the problem on trees and give deterministic\nalgorithms whose total movement cost is only $O(OPT + \\Delta \\cdot ERR)$, where\n$OPT$ is the distance from the start to the goal vertex, $\\Delta$ the maximum\ndegree, and the $ERR$ is the total number of vertices whose predictions are\nerroneous. We show this guarantee is optimal. We then consider a ''planning''\nversion of the problem where the graph and predictions are known at the\nbeginning, so the agent can use this global information to devise a search\nstrategy of low cost. For this planning version, we go beyond trees and give an\nalgorithms which gets good performance on (weighted) graphs with bounded\ndoubling dimension.",

    "abstract": "We present a new perspective on the use of weighted essentially\nnonoscillatory (WENO) reconstructions in high-order methods for scalar\nhyperbolic conservation laws. The main focus of this work is on nonlinear\nstabilization of continuous Galerkin (CG) approximations. The proposed\nmethodology also provides an interesting alternative to WENO-based limiters for\ndiscontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. Unlike Runge--Kutta DG schemes that\noverwrite finite element solutions with WENO reconstructions, our approach uses\na reconstruction-based smoothness sensor to blend the numerical viscosity\noperators of high- and low-order stabilization terms. The so-defined WENO\napproximation introduces low-order nonlinear diffusion in the vicinity of\nshocks, while preserving the high-order accuracy of a linearly stable baseline\ndiscretization in regions where the exact solution is sufficiently smooth. The\nunderlying reconstruction procedure performs Hermite interpolation on stencils\nconsisting of a mesh cell and its neighbors. The amount of numerical\ndissipation depends on the relative differences between partial derivatives of\nreconstructed candidate polynomials and those of the underlying finite element\napproximation. All derivatives are taken into account by the employed\nsmoothness sensor. To assess the accuracy of our CG-WENO scheme, we derive\nerror estimates and perform numerical experiments. In particular, we prove that\nthe consistency error of the nonlinear stabilization is of the order $p+1/2$,\nwhere $p$ is the polynomial degree. This estimate is optimal for general\nmeshes. For uniform meshes and smooth exact solutions, the experimentally\nobserved rate of convergence is as high as $p+1$.",

As one of the important face features, the\nface depth map, which has shown to be effective in other areas such as the face\nrecognition or face detection, is unfortunately paid little attention to in\nliterature for detecting the manipulated face images.

In\nthis work, we propose a gestalt-perception transformer model for diagram object\ndetection, which is based on an encoder-decoder architecture. Gestalt\nperception contains a series of laws to explain human perception, that the\nhuman visual system tends to perceive patches in an image that are similar,\nclose or connected without abrupt directional changes as a perceptual whole\nobject. Inspired by these thoughts, we build a gestalt-perception graph in\ntransformer encoder, which is composed of diagram patches as nodes and the\nrelationships between patches as edges. This graph aims to group these patches\ninto objects via laws of similarity, proximity, and smoothness implied in these\nedges, so that the meaningful objects can be effectively detected.

As it is well known that cellular networks have been considered\nas the primary infrastructure for M2M communications, there are several key\nissues to be addressed in order to deploy M2M communications over cellular\nnetworks. Notably, the rapid growth of M2M traffic dramatically increases\nenergy consumption, as well as degrades the performance of existing\nHuman-to-Human (H2H) traffic. Sustainable operation technology and resource\nmanagement are efficacious ways for solving these issues. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a resource management problem in cellular networks with H2H/M2M\ncoexistence. First, considering the energy-constrained nature of machine type\ncommunication devices (MTCDs), we propose a novel network model enabled by\nsimultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), which empowers\nMTCDs with the ability to simultaneously perform energy harvesting (EH) and\ninformation decoding. Given the diverse characteristics of IoT devices, we\nsubdivide MTCDs into critical and tolerable types, further formulating the\nresource management problem as an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem\nunder divers Quality-of-Service (QoS) constraints. Then, we develop a\nmulti-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based scheme to solve this\nproblem. It provides optimal spectrum, transmit power and power splitting (PS)\nratio allocation policies, along with efficient model training under designed\nbehaviour-tracking based state space and common reward function.

    "abstract": "Integrated with high share of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs), microgrids are\nprone to frequency stability issues, especially after unintentional islanding\nfrom the maingrid. To enhance the frequency stability of microgrids with high\nRES penetration, this paper proposes a simultaneous optimal provision strategy\nof the virtual inertia and virtual damping from Inverter-Based Resources\n(IBRs). The optimal values of the virtual inertia and damping of each\nindividual IBR are determined, such that the frequency stability can be ensured\nin the most cost-effective manner from the perspective of microgrid operation.\nMoreover, the non-essential load shedding and the associated time delay are\nexplicitly modeled to avoid underestimations of frequency deviation. The\nresulting complex frequency dynamics are analytically solved to generate the\nfrequency security constraints. The highly nonlinear frequency nadir constraint\nis further reformulated through novel optimization-orientated control design\ninto a Second-Order Cone (SOC) form. The effectiveness and significant economic\nvalue of the proposed simultaneous virtual inertia and damping provision\nstrategy are demonstrated based on case studies in a modified IEEE 33-bus\nsystem.",

Towards this aim, we reformulate\nthe problem as a box--constrained optimization problem where the roots of a set\nof nonlinear equations need to be determined. Then, we propose to use a\nprojected Newton's approach combined with a gradient descent algorithm so that\nevery limit point of the sequence generated by the overall algorithm is a\nstationary point. More importantly, we suggest replacing the standard\northogonal projector with a novel operator that ensures the final solution to\nsatisfy the box constraints while lowering the probability that the\nintermediate points reached at each iteration belong to the boundary of the box\nwhere the Jacobian of the objective function may be singular. The effectiveness\nof the proposed approach is shown in a practical scenario concerning a chemical\nreaction network modeling the signaling network of colorectal cancer cells.\nSpecifically, in this scenario the proposed algorithm is proven to be faster\nand more accurate than a classical dynamical approach where the asymptotically\nstable states are computed as the limit points of the flux of the Cauchy\nproblem associated with the ODEs system.",

    "abstract": "High-utility sequential pattern mining (HUSPM) has emerged as an important\ntopic due to its wide application and considerable popularity. However, due to\nthe combinatorial explosion of the search space when the HUSPM problem\nencounters a low utility threshold or large-scale data, it may be\ntime-consuming and memory-costly to address the HUSPM problem. Several\nalgorithms have been proposed for addressing this problem, but they still cost\na lot in terms of running time and memory usage. In this paper, to further\nsolve this problem efficiently, we design a compact structure called sequence\nprojection (seqPro) and propose an efficient algorithm, namely discovering\nhigh-utility sequential patterns with the seqPro structure (HUSP-SP). HUSP-SP\nutilizes the compact seq-array to store the necessary information in a sequence\ndatabase. The seqPro structure is designed to efficiently calculate candidate\npatterns' utilities and upper bound values. Furthermore, a new upper bound on\nutility, namely tighter reduced sequence utility (TRSU) and two pruning\nstrategies in search space, are utilized to improve the mining performance of\nHUSP-SP. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-life datasets show\nthat HUSP-SP can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in\nterms of running time, memory usage, search space pruning efficiency, and\nscalability.",

HIER achieved this goal with no annotation for the semantic hierarchy\nbut by learning hierarchical proxies in hyperbolic spaces. The hierarchical\nproxies are learnable parameters, and each of them is trained to serve as an\nancestor of a group of data or other proxies to approximate the semantic\nhierarchy among them.

In\nparticular, we consider stochastic systems with additive noise, whose\ndistribution lies in an ambiguity set of distributions that are\n$\\varepsilon-$close to a nominal one according to the Wasserstein distance. For\nthis class of systems, we derive control synthesis algorithms that are robust\nagainst all these distributions and maximize the probability of satisfying a\nreach-avoid specification. The framework we present first learns an abstraction\nof a switched stochastic system as a robust Markov decision process (robust\nMDP) by accounting for both the stochasticity of the system and the uncertainty\nin the noise distribution. Then, it synthesizes a strategy on the resulting\nrobust MDP that maximizes the probability of satisfying the property and is\nrobust to all uncertainty in the system. This strategy is then refined into a\nswitching strategy for the original stochastic system. By exploiting tools from\noptimal transport and stochastic programming, we show that synthesizing such a\nstrategy reduces to solving a set of linear programs, thus guaranteeing\nefficiency.

    "abstract": "Accurate and smooth global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning for\npedestrians in urban canyons is still a challenge due to the multipath effects\nand the non-light-of-sight (NLOS) receptions caused by the reflections from\nsurrounding buildings. The recently developed factor graph optimization (FGO)\nbased GNSS positioning method opened a new window for improving urban GNSS\npositioning by effectively exploiting the measurement redundancy from the\nhistorical information to resist the outlier measurements. Unfortunately, the\nFGO-based GNSS standalone positioning is still challenged in highly urbanized\nareas. As an extension of the previous FGO-based GNSS positioning method, this\npaper exploits the potential of the pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) model in\nFGO to improve the GNSS standalone positioning performance in urban canyons.\nSpecifically, the relative motion of the pedestrian is estimated based on the\nraw acceleration measurements from the onboard smartphone inertial measurement\nunit (IMU) via the PDR algorithm. Then the raw GNSS pseudorange, Doppler\nmeasurements, and relative motion from PDR are integrated using the FGO. Given\nthe context of pedestrian navigation with a small acceleration most of the\ntime, a novel soft motion model is proposed to smooth the states involved in\nthe factor graph model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified\nstep-by-step through two datasets collected in dense urban canyons of Hong Kong\nusing smartphone-level GNSS receivers. The comparison between the conventional\nextended Kalman filter, several existing methods, and FGO-based integration is\npresented. The results reveal that the existing FGO-based GNSS standalone\npositioning is highly complementary to the PDR's relative motion estimation.\nBoth improved positioning accuracy and trajectory smoothness are obtained with\nthe help of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic expansion architecture is becoming popular in class incremental\nlearning, mainly due to its advantages in alleviating catastrophic forgetting.\nHowever, task confusion is not well assessed within this framework, e.g., the\ndiscrepancy between classes of different tasks is not well learned (i.e.,\ninter-task confusion, ITC), and certain priority is still given to the latest\nclass batch (i.e., old-new confusion, ONC). We empirically validate the side\neffects of the two types of confusion. Meanwhile, a novel solution called Task\nCorrelated Incremental Learning (TCIL) is proposed to encourage discriminative\nand fair feature utilization across tasks. TCIL performs a multi-level\nknowledge distillation to propagate knowledge learned from old tasks to the new\none. It establishes information flow paths at both feature and logit levels,\nenabling the learning to be aware of old classes. Besides, attention mechanism\nand classifier re-scoring are applied to generate more fair classification\nscores. We conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100 datasets.\nThe results demonstrate that TCIL consistently achieves state-of-the-art\naccuracy. It mitigates both ITC and ONC, while showing advantages in battle\nwith catastrophic forgetting even no rehearsal memory is reserved.",

    "abstract": "Event-based vision has been rapidly growing in recent years justified by the\nunique characteristics it presents such as its high temporal resolutions\n(~1us), high dynamic range (>120dB), and output latency of only a few\nmicroseconds. This work further explores a hybrid, multi-modal, approach for\nobject detection and tracking that leverages state-of-the-art frame-based\ndetectors complemented by hand-crafted event-based methods to improve the\noverall tracking performance with minimal computational overhead. The methods\npresented include event-based bounding box (BB) refinement that improves the\nprecision of the resulting BBs, as well as a continuous event-based object\ndetection method, to recover missed detections and generate inter-frame\ndetections that enable a high-temporal-resolution tracking output. The\nadvantages of these methods are quantitatively verified by an ablation study\nusing the higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) metric. Results show\nsignificant performance gains resembled by an improvement in the HOTA from\n56.6%, using only frames, to 64.1% and 64.9%, for the event and edge-based mask\nconfigurations combined with the two methods proposed, at the baseline\nframerate of 24Hz. Likewise, incorporating these methods with the same\nconfigurations has improved HOTA from 52.5% to 63.1%, and from 51.3% to 60.2%\nat the high-temporal-resolution tracking rate of 384Hz. Finally, a validation\nexperiment is conducted to analyze the real-world single-object tracking\nperformance using high-speed LiDAR. Empirical evidence shows that our\napproaches provide significant advantages compared to using frame-based object\ndetectors at the baseline framerate of 24Hz and higher tracking rates of up to\n500Hz.",

PLCs were initially designed to work in a\ntrusted industrial network, which however can be brittle once deployed in an\nInternet-facing (or penetrated) network. Yet, there is a lack of systematic\nempirical analysis of the run-time security of modern real-world PLCs. To close\nthis gap, we present the first large-scale measurement on 23 off-the-shelf PLCs\nacross 13 leading vendors.

To sum up, the unsupervised logic applications can cause system\nresource/privilege abuse, which gives adversaries new means to hijack the\ncontrol flow of a runtime system remotely (without exploiting memory\nvulnerabilities); 2) the improper access control mechanisms bring many\nunauthorized access implications; 3) the proprietary or semi-proprietary\nprotocols are fragile regarding confidentiality and integrity protection of\nrun-time data.

One of the promising approaches to\nsolve it is decomposing the problem into the smaller sub problems and combining\nthe local solutions into the global one. The crux of any planning method for\nnon-holonomic robots is the generation of motion primitives that generates\nsolutions to local planning sub-problems. In this work we introduce a novel\nlearnable steering function (policy), which takes into account kinodynamic\nconstraints of the robot and both static and dynamic obstacles. This policy is\nefficiently trained via the policy optimization. Empirically, we show that our\nsteering function generalizes well to unseen problems. We then plug in the\ntrained policy into the sampling-based and lattice-based planners, and evaluate\nthe resultant POLAMP algorithm (Policy Optimization that Learns Adaptive Motion\nPrimitives) in a range of challenging setups that involve a car-like robot\noperating in the obstacle-rich parking-lot environments.

In teacher-student model, data augmentation is usually adopted on\nunlabeled data to regularize the consistent training between teacher and\nstudent. We start from a key perspective that fixed relative locations and\nvariable sizes of different organs can provide distribution information where a\nmulti-organ CT scan is drawn. Thus, we treat the prior anatomy as a strong tool\nto guide the data augmentation and reduce the mismatch between labeled and\nunlabeled images for semi-supervised learning. More specifically, we propose a\ndata augmentation strategy based on partition-and-recovery N$^3$ cubes cross-\nand within- labeled and unlabeled images. Our strategy encourages unlabeled\nimages to learn organ semantics in relative locations from the labeled images\n(cross-branch) and enhances the learning ability for small organs\n(within-branch). For within-branch, we further propose to refine the quality of\npseudo labels by blending the learned representations from small cubes to\nincorporate local attributes. Our method is termed as MagicNet, since it treats\nthe CT volume as a magic-cube and $N^3$-cube partition-and-recovery process\nmatches with the rule of playing a magic-cube. Extensive experiments on two\npublic CT multi-organ datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MagicNet, and\nnoticeably outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised medical image\nsegmentation approaches, with +7% DSC improvement on MACT dataset with 10%\nlabeled images.",

As a result, data movement for these millions of model parameters\ncauses a growing imbalance known as the memory wall. Neuromorphic computing is\nan emerging paradigm that confronts this imbalance by performing computations\ndirectly in analog memories. On the software side, the sequential\nBackpropagation algorithm prevents efficient parallelization and thus fast\nconvergence. A novel method, Direct Feedback Alignment, resolves inherent layer\ndependencies by directly passing the error from the output to each layer. At\nthe intersection of hardware/software co-design, there is a demand for\ndeveloping algorithms that are tolerable to hardware nonidealities. Therefore,\nthis work explores the interrelationship of implementing bio-plausible learning\nin-situ on neuromorphic hardware, emphasizing energy, area, and latency\nconstraints. Using the benchmarking framework DNN+NeuroSim, we investigate the\nimpact of hardware nonidealities and quantization on algorithm performance, as\nwell as how network topologies and algorithm-level design choices can scale\nlatency, energy and area consumption of a chip. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis work is the first to compare the impact of different learning algorithms\non Compute-In-Memory-based hardware and vice versa. The best results achieved\nfor accuracy remain Backpropagation-based, notably when facing hardware\nimperfections.

Given that these metrics were developed with different\napplication contexts and ranking algorithms in mind, it is not straightforward\nwhich metric to choose for a given scenario. In this paper, we perform a\ncomprehensive comparative analysis of existing group fairness metrics developed\nin the context of fair ranking. By virtue of their diverse application\ncontexts, we argue that such a comparative analysis is not straightforward.\nHence, we take an axiomatic approach whereby we design a set of thirteen\nproperties for group fairness metrics that consider different ranking settings.\nA metric can then be selected depending on whether it satisfies all or a subset\nof these properties. We apply these properties on eleven existing group\nfairness metrics, and through both empirical and theoretical results we\ndemonstrate that most of these metrics only satisfy a small subset of the\nproposed properties. These findings highlight limitations of existing metrics,\nand provide insights into how to evaluate and interpret different fairness\nmetrics in practical deployment. The proposed properties can also assist\npractitioners in selecting appropriate metrics for evaluating fairness in a\nspecific application.",

In the realm\nof air quality monitoring, this can be incredibly useful in detecting sudden\nchanges in local dust particle density, which can be difficult to accurately\nmeasure using commercial instruments. Traditional methods for air quality\nmeasurement often rely on calibrating the measurement with public standard\ninstruments or calculating the measurements moving average over a constant\nperiod. However, this can lead to an incorrect index at the measurement\nlocation, as well as an oversmoothing effect on the signal.

Despite the considerable progress, the\nexisting deep time series clustering approaches mostly seek to train the deep\nneural network by some instance reconstruction based or cluster distribution\nbased objective, which, however, lack the ability to exploit the sample-wise\n(or augmentation-wise) contrastive information or even the higher-level (e.g.,\ncluster-level) contrastiveness for learning discriminative and\nclustering-friendly representations. In light of this, this paper presents a\ndeep temporal contrastive clustering (DTCC) approach, which for the first time,\nto our knowledge, incorporates the contrastive learning paradigm into the deep\ntime series clustering research. Specifically, with two parallel views\ngenerated from the original time series and their augmentations, we utilize two\nidentical auto-encoders to learn the corresponding representations, and in the\nmeantime perform the cluster distribution learning by incorporating a k-means\nobjective. Further, two levels of contrastive learning are simultaneously\nenforced to capture the instance-level and cluster-level contrastive\ninformation, respectively. With the reconstruction loss of the auto-encoder,\nthe cluster distribution loss, and the two levels of contrastive losses jointly\noptimized, the network architecture is trained in a self-supervised manner and\nthe clustering result can thereby be obtained. Experiments on a variety of time\nseries datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DTCC approach over the\nstate-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "The task of video prediction and generation is known to be notoriously\ndifficult, with the research in this area largely limited to short-term\npredictions. Though plagued with noise and stochasticity, videos consist of\nfeatures that are organised in a spatiotemporal hierarchy, different features\npossessing different temporal dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic\nLatent Hierarchy (DLH) -- a deep hierarchical latent model that represents\nvideos as a hierarchy of latent states that evolve over separate and fluid\ntimescales. Each latent state is a mixture distribution with two components,\nrepresenting the immediate past and the predicted future, causing the model to\nlearn transitions only between sufficiently dissimilar states, while clustering\ntemporally persistent states closer together. Using this unique property, DLH\nnaturally discovers the spatiotemporal structure of a dataset and learns\ndisentangled representations across its hierarchy. We hypothesise that this\nsimplifies the task of modeling temporal dynamics of a video, improves the\nlearning of long-term dependencies, and reduces error accumulation. As\nevidence, we demonstrate that DLH outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in\nvideo prediction, is able to better represent stochasticity, as well as to\ndynamically adjust its hierarchical and temporal structure.

    "abstract": "Meta Learning automates the search for learning algorithms. At the same time,\nit creates a dependency on human engineering on the meta-level, where meta\nlearning algorithms need to be designed. In this paper, we investigate\nself-referential meta learning systems that modify themselves without the need\nfor explicit meta optimization. We discuss the relationship of such systems to\nin-context and memory-based meta learning and show that self-referential neural\nnetworks require functionality to be reused in the form of parameter sharing.\nFinally, we propose fitness monotonic execution (FME), a simple approach to\navoid explicit meta optimization. A neural network self-modifies to solve\nbandit and classic control tasks, improves its self-modifications, and learns\nhow to learn, purely by assigning more computational resources to better\nperforming solutions.",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the problem of statistical and system heterogeneity in\na cross-silo Federated Learning (FL) framework where there exist a limited\nnumber of Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT) devices in a smart building. We\npropose a novel Graph Signal Processing (GSP)-inspired aggregation rule based\non graph filtering dubbed ``G-Fedfilt''. The proposed aggregator enables a\nstructured flow of information based on the graph's topology. This behavior\nallows capturing the interconnection of CIoT devices and training\ndomain-specific models. The embedded graph filter is equipped with a tunable\nparameter which enables a continuous trade-off between domain-agnostic and\ndomain-specific FL. In the case of domain-agnostic, it forces G-Fedfilt to act\nsimilar to the conventional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) aggregation rule. The\nproposed G-Fedfilt also enables an intrinsic smooth clustering based on the\ngraph connectivity without explicitly specified which further boosts the\npersonalization of the models in the framework. In addition, the proposed\nscheme enjoys a communication-efficient time-scheduling to alleviate the system\nheterogeneity. This is accomplished by adaptively adjusting the amount of\ntraining data samples and sparsity of the models' gradients to reduce\ncommunication desynchronization and latency. Simulation results show that the\nproposed G-Fedfilt achieves up to $3.99\\% $ better classification accuracy than\nthe conventional FedAvg when concerning model personalization on the\nstatistically heterogeneous local datasets, while it is capable of yielding up\nto $2.41\\%$ higher accuracy than FedAvg in the case of testing the\ngeneralization of the models.",

    "abstract": "Nearly all jurisdictions in the United States require a professional license\nexam, commonly referred to as \"the Bar Exam,\" as a precondition for law\npractice. To even sit for the exam, most jurisdictions require that an\napplicant completes at least seven years of post-secondary education, including\nthree years at an accredited law school. In addition, most test-takers also\nundergo weeks to months of further, exam-specific preparation. Despite this\nsignificant investment of time and capital, approximately one in five\ntest-takers still score under the rate required to pass the exam on their first\ntry. In the face of a complex task that requires such depth of knowledge, what,\nthen, should we expect of the state of the art in \"AI?\" In this research, we\ndocument our experimental evaluation of the performance of OpenAI's\n`text-davinci-003` model, often-referred to as GPT-3.5, on the multistate\nmultiple choice (MBE) section of the exam. While we find no benefit in\nfine-tuning over GPT-3.5's zero-shot performance at the scale of our training\ndata, we do find that hyperparameter optimization and prompt engineering\npositively impacted GPT-3.5's zero-shot performance. For best prompt and\nparameters, GPT-3.5 achieves a headline correct rate of 50.3% on a complete\nNCBE MBE practice exam, significantly in excess of the 25% baseline guessing\nrate, and performs at a passing rate for both Evidence and Torts. GPT-3.5's\nranking of responses is also highly-correlated with correctness; its top two\nand top three choices are correct 71% and 88% of the time, respectively,\nindicating very strong non-entailment performance. While our ability to\ninterpret these results is limited by nascent scientific understanding of LLMs\nand the proprietary nature of GPT, we believe that these results strongly\nsuggest that an LLM will pass the MBE component of the Bar Exam in the near\nfuture.",

    "abstract": "Software Defect Prediction aims at predicting which software modules are the\nmost probable to contain defects. The idea behind this approach is to save time\nduring the development process by helping find bugs early. Defect Prediction\nmodels are based on historical data. Specifically, one can use data collected\nfrom past software distributions, or Versions, of the same target application\nunder analysis. Defect Prediction based on past versions is called Cross\nVersion Defect Prediction (CVDP). Traditionally, Static Code Metrics are used\nto predict defects. In this work, we use the Class Dependency Network (CDN) as\nanother predictor for defects, combined with static code metrics. CDN data\ncontains structural information about the target application being analyzed.\nUsually, CDN data is analyzed using different handcrafted network measures,\nlike Social Network metrics. Our approach uses network embedding techniques to\nleverage CDN information without having to build the metrics manually. In order\nto use the embeddings between versions, we incorporate different embedding\nalignment techniques. To evaluate our approach, we performed experiments on 24\nsoftware release pairs and compared it against several benchmark methods. In\nthese experiments, we analyzed the performance of two different graph embedding\ntechniques, three anchor selection approaches, and two alignment techniques. We\nalso built a meta-model based on two different embeddings and achieved a\nstatistically significant improvement in AUC of 4.7% (p < 0.002) over the\nbaseline method.",

    "abstract": "Learning policies from fixed offline datasets is a key challenge to scale up\nreinforcement learning (RL) algorithms towards practical applications. This is\noften because off-policy RL algorithms suffer from distributional shift, due to\nmismatch between dataset and the target policy, leading to high variance and\nover-estimation of value functions. In this work, we propose variance\nregularization for offline RL algorithms, using stationary distribution\ncorrections. We show that by using Fenchel duality, we can avoid double\nsampling issues for computing the gradient of the variance regularizer. The\nproposed algorithm for offline variance regularization (OVAR) can be used to\naugment any existing offline policy optimization algorithms. We show that the\nregularizer leads to a lower bound to the offline policy optimization\nobjective, which can help avoid over-estimation errors, and explains the\nbenefits of our approach across a range of continuous control domains when\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.",

For this problem, under uncoded placement, Parrinello, \\\"Unsal, and\nElia showed an optimal SC-CC scheme, in which the subpacketization level\ndepends upon the number of caches. We show an SC-CC scheme where the\nsubpacketization level does not directly depend upon the number of users or\ncaches; any number of caches and users can be accommodated for a fixed\nsubpacketization level. Furthermore, new caches can be added without re-doing\nthe placement of the existing caches.

We demonstrate how network topology capacitates an adversary to\ninfluence age scaling in a network. We show that in a fully connected network,\na single infected node increases the expected age from $O(\\log n)$ to $O(n)$.\nFurther, we show that the optimal behavior for an adversary is to reset the\ntimestamps of all outgoing packets to the current time and of all incoming\npackets to an outdated time for the infected node; thereby preventing any fresh\ninformation to go into the infected node, and facilitating acceptance of stale\ninformation out of the infected node into other network nodes. Lastly for fully\nconnected network, we show that if an infected node contacts only a single node\ninstead of all nodes of the network, the system age can still be degraded to\n$O(n)$. These show that fully connected nature of a network can be both a\nbenefit and a detriment for information freshness; full connectivity, while\nenabling fast dissemination of information, also enables fast dissipation of\nadversarial inputs. We then analyze the unidirectional ring network, the other\nend of the network connectivity spectrum, where we show that the adversarial\neffect on age scaling of a node is limited by its distance from the adversary,\nand the age scaling for a large fraction of the network continues to be\n$O(\\sqrt{n})$, unchanged from the case with no adversary.

However, accurately detecting movie\nscenes is often challenging as it requires the ability to reason over very long\nmovie segments. This is in contrast to most existing video recognition models,\nwhich are typically designed for short-range video analysis. This work proposes\na State-Space Transformer model that can efficiently capture dependencies in\nlong movie videos for accurate movie scene detection. Our model, dubbed\nTranS4mer, is built using a novel S4A building block, which combines the\nstrengths of structured state-space sequence (S4) and self-attention (A)\nlayers. Given a sequence of frames divided into movie shots (uninterrupted\nperiods where the camera position does not change), the S4A block first applies\nself-attention to capture short-range intra-shot dependencies. Afterward, the\nstate-space operation in the S4A block is used to aggregate long-range\ninter-shot cues. The final TranS4mer model, which can be trained end-to-end, is\nobtained by stacking the S4A blocks one after the other multiple times. Our\nproposed TranS4mer outperforms all prior methods in three movie scene detection\ndatasets, including MovieNet, BBC, and OVSD, while also being $2\\times$ faster\nand requiring $3\\times$ less GPU memory than standard Transformer models.

Yet, little attention has been given towards FA in solving\n\\textit{general-sum} extensive-form games, despite them being widely regarded\nas being computationally more challenging than their fully competitive or\ncooperative counterparts. A key challenge is that for many equilibria in\ngeneral-sum games, no simple analogue to the state value function used in\nMarkov Decision Processes and zero-sum games exists. In this paper, we propose\nlearning the \\textit{Enforceable Payoff Frontier} (EPF) -- a generalization of\nthe state value function for general-sum games. We approximate the optimal\n\\textit{Stackelberg extensive-form correlated equilibrium} by representing EPFs\nwith neural networks and training them by using appropriate backup operations\nand loss functions. This is the first method that applies FA to the Stackelberg\nsetting, allowing us to scale to much larger games while still enjoying\nperformance guarantees based on FA error. Additionally, our proposed method\nguarantees incentive compatibility and is easy to evaluate without having to\ndepend on self-play or approximate best-response oracles.",

    "abstract": "As a result of the ever-increasing application of cyber-physical components\nin the automotive industry, cybersecurity has become an urgent topic. Adapting\ntechnologies and communication protocols like Ethernet and WiFi in connected\nvehicles yields many attack scenarios. Consequently, ISO/SAE 21434 and UN R155\n(2021) define a standard and regulatory framework for automotive cybersecurity.\nBoth documents follow a risk management-based approach and require a threat\nmodeling methodology for risk analysis and identification. Such a threat\nmodeling methodology must conform to the Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment\n(TARA) framework of ISO/SAE 21434. Conversely, existing threat modeling methods\nenumerate isolated threats disregarding the vehicle's design and connections.\nConsequently, they neglect the role of attack paths from a vehicle's interfaces\nto its assets. In other words, they are missing the TARA work products, e.g.,\nattack paths compromising assets or feasibility and impact ratings. We propose\na threat modeling methodology to construct attack paths by identifying,\nsequencing, and connecting vulnerabilities from a valid attack surface to an\nasset. Initially, we transform cybersecurity guidelines to attack trees, and\nthen we use their formal interpretations to assess the vehicle's design. This\nworkflow yields compositional construction of attack paths along with the\nrequired TARA work products (e.g., attack paths, feasibility, and impact). More\nimportantly, we can apply the workflow iteratively in the context of connected\nvehicles to ensure design conformity, privacy, and cybersecurity. Finally, to\nshow the complexity and the importance of preemptive threat identification and\nrisk analysis in the automotive industry, we evaluate the presented model-based\napproach in a connected vehicle testing platform, SPIDER.",

    "abstract": "We consider a semi-supervised $k$-clustering problem where information is\navailable on whether pairs of objects are in the same or in different clusters.\nThis information is either available with certainty or with a limited level of\nconfidence. We introduce the PCCC algorithm, which iteratively assigns objects\nto clusters while accounting for the information provided on the pairs of\nobjects. Our algorithm can include relationships as hard constraints that are\nguaranteed to be satisfied or as soft constraints that can be violated subject\nto a penalty. This flexibility distinguishes our algorithm from the\nstate-of-the-art in which all pairwise constraints are either considered hard,\nor all are considered soft. Unlike existing algorithms, our algorithm scales to\nlarge-scale instances with up to 60,000 objects, 100 clusters, and millions of\ncannot-link constraints (which are the most challenging constraints to\nincorporate). We compare the PCCC algorithm with state-of-the-art approaches in\nan extensive computational study.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, feature selection is frequently used in machine learning when there\nis a risk of performance degradation due to overfitting or when computational\nresources are limited. During the feature selection process, the subset of\nfeatures that are most relevant and least redundant is chosen. In recent years,\nit has become clear that, in addition to relevance and redundancy, features'\ncomplementarity must be considered. Informally, if the features are weak\npredictors of the target variable separately and strong predictors when\ncombined, then they are complementary. It is demonstrated in this paper that\nthe synergistic effect of complementary features mutually amplifying each other\nin the construction of two-tier decision trees can be interfered with by\nanother feature, resulting in a decrease in performance. It is demonstrated\nusing cross-validation on both synthetic and real datasets, regression and\nclassification, that removing or eliminating the interfering feature can\nimprove performance by up to 24 times. It has also been discovered that the\nlesser the domain is learned, the greater the increase in performance. More\nformally, it is demonstrated that there is a statistically significant negative\nrank correlation between performance on the dataset prior to the elimination of\nthe interfering feature and performance growth after the elimination of the\ninterfering feature. It is concluded that this broadens the scope of feature\nselection methods for cases where data and computational resources are\nsufficient.",

    "abstract": "The ability to jointly learn from multiple modalities, such as text, audio,\nand visual data, is a defining feature of intelligent systems. While there have\nbeen promising advances in designing neural networks to harness multimodal\ndata, the enormous success of data augmentation currently remains limited to\nsingle-modality tasks like image classification. Indeed, it is particularly\ndifficult to augment each modality while preserving the overall semantic\nstructure of the data; for example, a caption may no longer be a good\ndescription of an image after standard augmentations have been applied, such as\ntranslation. Moreover, it is challenging to specify reasonable transformations\nthat are not tailored to a particular modality. In this paper, we introduce\nLeMDA, Learning Multimodal Data Augmentation, an easy-to-use method that\nautomatically learns to jointly augment multimodal data in feature space, with\nno constraints on the identities of the modalities or the relationship between\nmodalities. We show that LeMDA can (1) profoundly improve the performance of\nmultimodal deep learning architectures, (2) apply to combinations of modalities\nthat have not been previously considered, and (3) achieve state-of-the-art\nresults on a wide range of applications comprised of image, text, and tabular\ndata.",

One obstacle to this endeavor are the different\nskeleton formats provided by different datasets, i.e., they do not label the\nsame set of anatomical landmarks. There is little prior research on how to best\nsupervise one model with such discrepant labels.

The results from\nthe simulation based on the real 5G Standalone (SA) network throughput shows\nthat Pensieve 5G outperforms both conventional algorithms and Pensieve with the\naverage QoE improvement of 8.8% and 14.2%, respectively.

Traditionally,\npolitical scientists have studied these epistemic phenomena through\nlabor-intensive manual content analysis. We propose to help automate such work\nthrough epistemic stance prediction, drawn from research in computational\nsemantics, to distinguish at the clausal level what is asserted, denied, or\nonly ambivalently suggested by the author or other mentioned entities (belief\nholders). We first develop a simple RoBERTa-based model for multi-source stance\npredictions that outperforms more complex state-of-the-art modeling. Then we\ndemonstrate its novel application to political science by conducting a\nlarge-scale analysis of the Mass Market Manifestos corpus of U.S. political\nopinion books, where we characterize trends in cited belief holders --\nrespected allies and opposed bogeymen -- across U.S. political ideologies.",

    "abstract": "In models of opinion dynamics, many parameters -- either in the form of\nconstants or in the form of functions -- play a critical role in describing,\ncalibrating, and forecasting how opinions change with time. When examining a\nmodel of opinion dynamics, it is beneficial to infer its parameters using\nempirical data. In this paper, we study an example of such an inference\nproblem. We consider a mean-field bounded-confidence model with an unknown\ninteraction kernel between individuals. This interaction kernel encodes how\nindividuals with different opinions interact and affect each other's opinions.\nIt is often difficult to quantitatively measure social opinions as empirical\ndata from observations or experiments, so we assume that the available data\ntakes the form of partial observations of the cumulative distribution function\nof opinions. We prove that certain measurements guarantee a precise and unique\ninference of the interaction kernel and propose a numerical method to\nreconstruct an interaction kernel from a limited number of data points. Our\nnumerical results suggest that the error of the inferred interaction kernel\ndecays exponentially as we strategically enlarge the data set.",

However, recent\nadvances in NLP and speech modelling allow textual, acoustic, and hand-crafted\nlanguage-based features to jointly form the basis of future mental health\nscreening and condition detection. Speech is a rich and readily available\nsource of insight into an individual's cognitive state and by leveraging\ndifferent aspects of speech, we can develop new digital biomarkers for\ndepression and anxiety. To this end, we propose a multi-modal system for the\nscreening of depression and anxiety from self-administered speech tasks. The\nproposed model integrates deep-learned features from audio and text, as well as\nhand-crafted features that are informed by clinically-validated domain\nknowledge. We find that augmenting hand-crafted features with deep-learned\nfeatures improves our overall classification F1 score comparing to a baseline\nof hand-crafted features alone from 0.58 to 0.63 for depression and from 0.54\nto 0.57 for anxiety.

This problem arises when individual trajectories are not available\ndue to privacy issues or measurement fidelity. Instead, the aggregated\nobservations are measured over discrete-time points, for estimating the\npopulation flows among states. Most related studies tackle the problems by\nlearning the transition parameters of a time-homogeneous Markov process.\nNonetheless, most real-world population flows can be influenced by various\nuncertainties such as traffic jam and weather conditions. Thus, in many cases,\na time-homogeneous Markov model is a poor approximation of the much more\ncomplex population flows. To circumvent this difficulty, we resort to a\nmulti-marginal optimal transport (MOT) formulation that can naturally represent\naggregated observations with constrained marginals, and encode time-dependent\ntransition matrices by the cost functions. In particular, we propose to\nestimate the transition flows from aggregated data by learning the cost\nfunctions of the MOT framework, which enables us to capture time-varying\ndynamic patterns.

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a new passivity-based sliding mode control method\nfor mechanical port-Hamiltonian systems. Passivity-based sliding mode control\n(PBSMC) is unification of sliding mode control and passivity-based control. It\nachieves sliding mode control and Lyapunov stability simultaneously by\nemploying an energy based Lyapunov function. The proposed method gives a family\nof stabilizing controllers which smoothly interpolates passivity-based control\nand sliding mode control with free parameters. The freedom is useful to adjust\nthe trade-off between robustness against external disturbances and undesired\nchattering vibration. In addition, this paper relaxes the restrictive condition\nwhich is required in the authors' former result. As a result, we can apply the\nproposed PBSMC method to trajectory tracking control problems. Furthermore, the\nrobustness of the proposed controller against matched and unmatched\ndisturbances is investigated. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Video-language pre-training has advanced the performance of various\ndownstream video-language tasks. However, most previous methods directly\ninherit or adapt typical image-language pre-training paradigms to\nvideo-language pre-training, thus not fully exploiting the unique\ncharacteristic of video, i.e., temporal. In this paper, we propose a\nHierarchical Temporal-Aware video-language pre-training framework, HiTeA, with\ntwo novel pre-training tasks for modeling cross-modal alignment between moments\nand texts as well as the temporal relations of video-text pairs. Specifically,\nwe propose a cross-modal moment exploration task to explore moments in videos,\nwhich results in detailed video moment representation. Besides, the inherent\ntemporal relations are captured by aligning video-text pairs as a whole in\ndifferent time resolutions with multi-modal temporal relation exploration task.\nFurthermore, we introduce the shuffling test to evaluate the temporal reliance\nof datasets and video-language pre-training models. We achieve state-of-the-art\nresults on 15 well-established video-language understanding and generation\ntasks, especially on temporal-oriented datasets (e.g., SSv2-Template and\nSSv2-Label) with 8.6% and 11.1% improvement respectively.

In the control layer of the proposed\nmethod, control inputs are calculated by minimizing the traces of approximate\ninverse Bayesian Fisher information matrixes (FIMs).

    "abstract": "Automatic Image Cropping is a challenging task with many practical downstream\napplications. The task is often divided into sub-problems - generating cropping\ncandidates, finding the visually important regions, and determining aesthetics\nto select the most appealing candidate. Prior approaches model one or more of\nthese sub-problems separately, and often combine them sequentially. We propose\na novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based method to crop images\ndirectly, without explicitly modeling image aesthetics, evaluating multiple\ncrop candidates, or detecting visually salient regions. Our model is trained on\na large dataset of images cropped by experienced editors and can simultaneously\npredict bounding boxes for multiple fixed aspect ratios. We consider the aspect\nratio of the cropped image to be a critical factor that influences aesthetics.\nPrior approaches for automatic image cropping, did not enforce the aspect ratio\nof the outputs, likely due to a lack of datasets for this task. We, therefore,\nbenchmark our method on public datasets for two related tasks - first,\naesthetic image cropping without regard to aspect ratio, and second, thumbnail\ngeneration that requires fixed aspect ratio outputs, but where aesthetics are\nnot crucial. We show that our strategy is competitive with or performs better\nthan existing methods in both these tasks. Furthermore, our one-stage model is\neasier to train and significantly faster than existing two-stage or end-to-end\nmethods for inference. We present a qualitative evaluation study, and find that\nour model is able to generalize to diverse images from unseen datasets and\noften retains compositional properties of the original images after cropping.\nOur results demonstrate that explicitly modeling image aesthetics or visual\nattention regions is not necessarily required to build a competitive image\ncropping algorithm.",

It is anticipated that\nsensor packages will be installed on existing trailers to extend autonomous\noperations while operating in reverse in uncontrolled environments, like a\ncustomer's loading dock. Power Line Communication (PLC) between the trailer and\nthe tractor cannot support high bandwidth and low latency communication. This\npaper explores the impact of using Ethernet or a wireless medium for commercial\ntrailer-tractor communication on the lifecycle and operation of trailer\nelectronic control units (ECUs) from a Systems Engineering perspective to\naddress system requirements, integration, and security. Additionally,\ncontent-based and host-based networking approaches for in-vehicle\ncommunication, such as Named Data Networking (NDN) and IP-based networking are\ncompared. Implementation, testing and evaluation of prototype trailer ECU\ncommunication with the tractor ECUs over Ethernet is shown by transmitting\ndifferent data types simultaneously. These simultaneous data include signals\ntypically found on J1939 networks, LiDAR data packets and camera frames using a\nPC and three Raspberry Pis. The implementation is tested with two networking\napproaches, Named Data Networking, and Data Distribution Service (DDS) and the\ntest indicated that NDN over TCP is an efficient approach that outperformed DDS\nin two cases with less power consumed on the trailer side. Using Ethernet or a\nwireless harness and NDN for commercial trailer Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS)\nECU provides adequate resources for the operation of autonomous trucks and the\nexpansion of its capabilities, and at the same time significantly reduces the\ncomplexities compared to when new features are added to legacy communication\nsystems.",

However, existing works are limiting as\nthey do not explicitly exploit the temporal redundancy in videos, leading to a\nlong encoding time. Additionally, these methods have fixed architectures which\ndo not scale to longer videos or higher resolutions. To address these issues,\nwe propose NIRVANA, which treats videos as groups of frames and fits separate\nnetworks to each group performing patch-wise prediction. This design shares\ncomputation within each group, in the spatial and temporal dimensions,\nresulting in reduced encoding time of the video. The video representation is\nmodeled autoregressively, with networks fit on a current group initialized\nusing weights from the previous group's model. To further enhance efficiency,\nwe perform quantization of the network parameters during training, requiring no\npost-hoc pruning or quantization. When compared with previous works on the\nbenchmark UVG dataset, NIRVANA improves encoding quality from 37.36 to 37.70\n(in terms of PSNR) and the encoding speed by 12X, while maintaining the same\ncompression rate. In contrast to prior video INR works which struggle with\nlarger resolution and longer videos, we show that our algorithm is highly\nflexible and scales naturally due to its patch-wise and autoregressive designs.\nMoreover, our method achieves variable bitrate compression by adapting to\nvideos with varying inter-frame motion.

    "title": "Conformal Prediction Intervals for Remaining Useful Lifetime Estimation",
    "abstract": "The main objective of Prognostics and Health Management is to estimate the\nRemaining Useful Lifetime (RUL), namely, the time that a system or a piece of\nequipment is still in working order before starting to function incorrectly. In\nrecent years, numerous machine learning algorithms have been proposed for RUL\nestimation, mainly focusing on providing more accurate RUL predictions.\nHowever, there are many sources of uncertainty in the problem, such as inherent\nrandomness of systems failure, lack of knowledge regarding their future states,\nand inaccuracy of the underlying predictive models, making it infeasible to\npredict the RULs precisely. Hence, it is of utmost importance to quantify the\nuncertainty alongside the RUL predictions. In this work, we investigate the\nconformal prediction (CP) framework that represents uncertainty by predicting\nsets of possible values for the target variable (intervals in the case of RUL)\ninstead of making point predictions. Under very mild technical assumptions, CP\nformally guarantees that the actual value (true RUL) is covered by the\npredicted set with a degree of certainty that can be prespecified. We study\nthree CP algorithms to conformalize any single-point RUL predictor and turn it\ninto a valid interval predictor. Finally, we conformalize two single-point RUL\npredictors, deep convolutional neural networks and gradient boosting, and\nillustrate their performance on the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System\nSimulation (C-MAPSS) data sets.",

    "abstract": "Model bias triggered by long-tailed data has been widely studied. However,\nmeasure based on the number of samples cannot explicate three phenomena\nsimultaneously: (1) Given enough data, the classification performance gain is\nmarginal with additional samples. (2) Classification performance decays\nprecipitously as the number of training samples decreases when there is\ninsufficient data. (3) Model trained on sample-balanced datasets still has\ndifferent biases for different classes. In this work, we define and quantify\nthe semantic scale of classes, which is used to measure the feature diversity\nof classes. It is exciting to find experimentally that there is a marginal\neffect of semantic scale, which perfectly describes the first two phenomena.\nFurther, the quantitative measurement of semantic scale imbalance is proposed,\nwhich can accurately reflect model bias on multiple datasets, even on\nsample-balanced data, revealing a novel perspective for the study of class\nimbalance. Due to the prevalence of semantic scale imbalance, we propose\nsemantic-scale-balanced learning, including a general loss improvement scheme\nand a dynamic re-weighting training framework that overcomes the challenge of\ncalculating semantic scales in real-time during iterations. Comprehensive\nexperiments show that dynamic semantic-scale-balanced learning consistently\nenables the model to perform superiorly on large-scale long-tailed and\nnon-long-tailed natural and medical datasets, which is a good starting point\nfor mitigating the prevalent but unnoticed model bias.",

In this work, we leverage interactive machine learning\nand introduce a joint learning framework, termed DRG-Net, to effectively learn\nboth disease grading and multi-lesion segmentation. Our DRG-Net consists of two\nmodules: (i) DRG-AI-System to classify DR Grading, localize lesion areas, and\nprovide visual explanations; (ii) DRG-Expert-Interaction to receive feedback\nfrom user-expert and improve the DRG-AI-System. To deal with sparse data, we\nutilize transfer learning mechanisms to extract invariant feature\nrepresentations by using Wasserstein distance and adversarial learning-based\nentropy minimization. Besides, we propose a novel attention strategy at both\nlow- and high-level features to automatically select the most significant\nlesion information and provide explainable properties. In terms of human\ninteraction, we further develop DRG-Net as a tool that enables expert users to\ncorrect the system's predictions, which may then be used to update the system\nas a whole. Moreover, thanks to the attention mechanism and loss functions\nconstraint between lesion features and classification features, our approach\ncan be robust given a certain level of noise in the feedback of users.

    "title": "Blind Restoration of Real-World Audio by 1D Operational GANs",
    "abstract": "Objective: Despite numerous studies proposed for audio restoration in the\nliterature, most of them focus on an isolated restoration problem such as\ndenoising or dereverberation, ignoring other artifacts. Moreover, assuming a\nnoisy or reverberant environment with limited number of fixed\nsignal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) levels is a common practice. However,\nreal-world audio is often corrupted by a blend of artifacts such as\nreverberation, sensor noise, and background audio mixture with varying types,\nseverities, and duration. In this study, we propose a novel approach for blind\nrestoration of real-world audio signals by Operational Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (Op-GANs) with temporal and spectral objective metrics to enhance the\nquality of restored audio signal regardless of the type and severity of each\nartifact corrupting it. Methods: 1D Operational-GANs are used with generative\nneuron model optimized for blind restoration of any corrupted audio signal.\nResults: The proposed approach has been evaluated extensively over the\nbenchmark TIMIT-RAR (speech) and GTZAN-RAR (non-speech) datasets corrupted with\na random blend of artifacts each with a random severity to mimic real-world\naudio signals. Average SDR improvements of over 7.2 dB and 4.9 dB are achieved,\nrespectively, which are substantial when compared with the baseline methods.\nSignificance: This is a pioneer study in blind audio restoration with the\nunique capability of direct (time-domain) restoration of real-world audio\nwhilst achieving an unprecedented level of performance for a wide SDR range and\nartifact types. Conclusion: 1D Op-GANs can achieve robust and computationally\neffective real-world audio restoration with significantly improved performance.\nThe source codes and the generated real-world audio datasets are shared\npublicly with the research community in a dedicated GitHub repository1.",

Since manual data annotation is expensive and\ninefficient, most applications adopt unsupervised anomaly detection methods,\nbut the results are usually sub-optimal and unsatisfactory to end customers.\nWeak supervision is a promising paradigm for obtaining considerable labels in a\nlow-cost way, which enables the customers to label data by writing heuristic\nrules rather than annotating each instance individually. However, in the\ntime-series domain, it is hard for people to write reasonable labeling\nfunctions as the time-series data is numerically continuous and difficult to be\nunderstood. In this paper, we propose a Label-Efficient Interactive Time-Series\nAnomaly Detection (LEIAD) system, which enables a user to improve the results\nof unsupervised anomaly detection by performing only a small amount of\ninteractions with the system. To achieve this goal, the system integrates weak\nsupervision and active learning collaboratively while generating labeling\nfunctions automatically using only a few labeled data. All of these techniques\nare complementary and can promote each other in a reinforced manner. We conduct\nexperiments on three time-series anomaly detection datasets, demonstrating that\nthe proposed system is superior to existing solutions in both weak supervision\nand active learning areas.

Existing task coordination\nalgorithms either ignore the stochastic process or suffer from the\ncomputational intensity. Taking advantage of the weakly coupled feature of the\nproblem and the opportunity for coordination in advance, we propose a\ndecentralized auction-based coordination strategy using a newly formulated\nscore function which is generated by forming the problem into task-constrained\nMarkov decision processes (MDPs). The proposed method guarantees convergence\nand at least 50% optimality in the premise of a submodular reward function.\nFurthermore, for the implementation on large-scale applications, an approximate\nvariant of the proposed method, namely Deep Auction, is also suggested with the\nuse of neural networks, which is evasive of the troublesome for constructing\nMDPs. Inspired by the well-known actor-critic architecture, two Transformers\nare used to map observations to action probabilities and cumulative rewards\nrespectively. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the two proposed\napproaches in the context of drone deliveries, where the stochastic planning\nfor the drone league is cast into a stochastic price-collecting Vehicle Routing\nProblem (VRP) with time windows.

The VA-INS is\ncomposed of a vision unit (monocular or stereo camera) and a typical low-cost\n6-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) equipped with an accelerometer and a\ngyroscope. A major benefit of this approach is its applicability for\nenvironments where the Global Positioning System (GPS) is inaccessible. The\nproposed VTOL-UAV observer utilizes IMU and feature measurements to accurately\nestimate attitude (orientation), gyroscope bias, position, and linear velocity.\nAbility to use VA-INS measurements directly makes the proposed observer design\nmore computationally efficient as it obviates the need for attitude and\nposition reconstruction. Once the motion components are estimated, the\nobserver-based controller is used to control the VTOL-UAV attitude, angular\nvelocity, position, and linear velocity guiding the vehicle along the desired\ntrajectory in six degrees of freedom (6 DoF). The closed-loop estimation and\nthe control errors of the observer-based controller are proven to be\nexponentially stable starting from almost any initial condition. To achieve\nglobal and unique VTOL-UAV representation in 6 DoF, the proposed approach is\nposed on the Lie Group and the design in unit-quaternion is presented.

    "abstract": "Distributed applications often deal with data with different consistency\nrequirements: while a post in a social network only requires weak consistency,\nthe user balance in turn has strong correctness requirements, demanding\nmutations to be synchronised. To deal efficiently with sequences of operations\non different replicas of the distributed application, it is useful to know\nwhich operations commute with others and thus, when can an operation not\nrequiring synchronisation be anticipated wrt other requiring it, thus avoiding\nunnecessary waits. Herein we present a language-based static analysis to\nextract at compile-time from code information on which operations can commute\nwith which other operations and thus get information that can be used by the\nrun-time support to decide on call anticipations of operations in replicas\nwithout compromising consistency. We illustrate the formal analysis on several\nparadigmatic examples and briefly present a proof-of-concept implementation in\nJava.",

    "abstract": "Tumor-stroma ratio (TSR) is a prognostic factor for many types of solid\ntumors. In this study, we propose a method for automated estimation of TSR from\nhistopathological images of colorectal cancer. The method is based on\nconvolutional neural networks which were trained to classify colorectal cancer\ntissue in hematoxylin-eosin stained samples into three classes: stroma, tumor\nand other. The models were trained using a data set that consists of 1343 whole\nslide images. Three different training setups were applied with a transfer\nlearning approach using domain-specific data i.e. an external colorectal cancer\nhistopathological data set. The three most accurate models were chosen as a\nclassifier, TSR values were predicted and the results were compared to a visual\nTSR estimation made by a pathologist. The results suggest that classification\naccuracy does not improve when domain-specific data are used in the\npre-training of the convolutional neural network models in the task at hand.\nClassification accuracy for stroma, tumor and other reached 96.1$\\%$ on an\nindependent test set. Among the three classes the best model gained the highest\naccuracy (99.3$\\%$) for class tumor. When TSR was predicted with the best\nmodel, the correlation between the predicted values and values estimated by an\nexperienced pathologist was 0.57. Further research is needed to study\nassociations between computationally predicted TSR values and other\nclinicopathological factors of colorectal cancer and the overall survival of\nthe patients.",

    "abstract": "Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) for 5G is evolving into the\nextremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA) to increase the spectrum efficiency\nby orders of magnitude for 6G communications. ELAA introduces\nspherical-wave-based near-field communications, where channel capacity can be\nsignificantly improved for single-user and multi-user scenarios. Unfortunately,\nfor the widely studied uniform linear array (ULA), the near-field regions at\nlarge incidence angles will be reduced. Thus, many users randomly distributed\nin a cell may fail to benefit from near-field communications. In this paper, we\nleverage the rotational symmetry of uniform circular array (UCA) to provide\nuniform and enlarged near-field region for all users in a cell, enabling more\nusers to benefit from near-field communications. Specifically, by exploiting\nthe geometrical relationship between UCA and user with the spherical-wave\nmodel, the near-field beamforming technique for UCA is developed for the first\ntime. Based on the analysis of near-field beamforming, we reveal that UCA is\nable to provide a larger near-field region than ULA in terms of the effective\nRayleigh distance. Moreover, based on the UCA beamforming property, a\nconcentric-ring codebook is designed to realize efficient beamforming in the\nnear-field region of UCA. In addition, we find out that UCA could generate\northogonal near-field beams along the same direction, which has the potential\nfor further improvement of multi-user capacity compared with ULA. Simulation\nresults are provided to verify the feasibility of UCA to enable more users to\nbenefit from near-field communications by broadening the near-field region.",

    "abstract": "Wind power, as a green energy resource, grows rapidly worldwide. Wind farm\nplanning has become an important problem to be addressed. Wake effect in a wind\nfarm can cause wind speed deficits and a decrease in power generation of\ndownstream wind turbines (WTs), which has a nonnegligible impact on wind farm\nplanning but was seldom considered. In this paper, a bi-objective\ndistributionally robust planning model for wind farms and energy storage\nsystems (ESSs) is developed taking into account the wake effect. An ambiguity\nset based on Wasserstein metric is established to model the uncertainties.\nSince the wind power uncertainty is affected by the volatile wind speed and\nwind farm capacity decided in the first stage, the ambiguity set is\ndecision-dependent. To solve the problem, we first propose a stochastic\nprogramming approximation with the help of minimum Lipschitz constants. Methods\nfor evaluating the minimum Lipschitz constants are embedded into an iterative\nalgorithm to solve the proposed model. Case studies demonstrate the necessity\nof considering the wake effect and show the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod.",

Optimal and dynamic management of video bitrate, quality and energy\ndemands needs to take into account their inter-dependencies. With emerging\nnetwork generations providing higher bandwidth rates, there is also a growing\nneed to communicate video with the best quality subject to the availability of\nresources such as computational power and available bandwidth.

The approach\nprovides a basic system for multi-objective optimization with constraints on\npower, video quality, bitrate. This is accomplished by utilizing a recently\nintroduced framework known as Dynamically Reconfigurable Architectures for\nTime-varying Image Constraints (DRASTIC) in HEVC/H.265 codec with six different\nGOP configurations to support optimization modes for minimum bitrate, maximum\nquality and minimum computational time (minimum energy in constant power\nconfiguration) mode of operation.

However, some new\ncybersecurity issues have appeared together with this development. Some of\nthese issues are the deployment of unauthorized devices, malicious code\nmodification, malware deployment, or vulnerability exploitation. This fact has\nmotivated the requirement for new device identification mechanisms based on\nbehavior monitoring. Besides, these solutions have recently leveraged Machine\nand Deep Learning techniques due to the advances in this field and the increase\nin processing capabilities. In contrast, attackers do not stay stalled and have\ndeveloped adversarial attacks focused on context modification and ML/DL\nevaluation evasion applied to IoT device identification solutions. This work\nexplores the performance of hardware behavior-based individual device\nidentification, how it is affected by possible context- and ML/DL-focused\nattacks, and how its resilience can be improved using defense techniques. In\nthis sense, it proposes an LSTM-CNN architecture based on hardware performance\nbehavior for individual device identification. Then, previous techniques have\nbeen compared with the proposed architecture using a hardware performance\ndataset collected from 45 Raspberry Pi devices running identical software. The\nLSTM-CNN improves previous solutions achieving a +0.96 average F1-Score and 0.8\nminimum TPR for all devices.

    "abstract": "Supervised learning methods have been suffering from the fact that a\nlarge-scale labeled dataset is mandatory, which is difficult to obtain. This\nhas been a more significant issue for fashion compatibility prediction because\ncompatibility aims to capture people's perception of aesthetics, which are\nsparse and changing. Thus, the labeled dataset may become outdated quickly due\nto fast fashion. Moreover, labeling the dataset always needs some expert\nknowledge; at least they should have a good sense of aesthetics. However, there\nare limited self/semi-supervised learning techniques in this field. In this\npaper, we propose a general color distortion prediction task forcing the\nbaseline to recognize low-level image information to learn more discriminative\nrepresentation for fashion compatibility prediction. Specifically, we first\npropose to distort the image by adjusting the image color balance, contrast,\nsharpness, and brightness. Then, we propose adding Gaussian noise to the\ndistorted image before passing them to the convolutional neural network (CNN)\nbackbone to learn a probability distribution over all possible distortions.

    "abstract": "Effective management of public shared spaces such as car parking space, is\none challenging transformational aspect for many cities, especially in the\ndeveloping World. By leveraging sensing technologies, cloud computing, and\nArtificial Intelligence, Cities are increasingly being managed smartly. Smart\nCities not only bring convenience to City dwellers, but also improve their\nquality of life as advocated for by United Nations in the 2030 Sustainable\nDevelopment Goal on Sustainable Cities and Communities. Through integration of\nInternet of Things and Cloud Computing, this paper presents a successful\nproof-of-concept implementation of a framework for managing public car parking\nspaces. Reservation of parking slots is done through a cloud-hosted\napplication, while access to and out of the parking slot is enabled through\nRadio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology which in real-time,\naccordingly triggers update of the parking slot availability in the\ncloud-hosted database. This framework could bring considerable convenience to\nCity dwellers since motorists only have to drive to a parking space when sure\nof a vacant parking slot, an important stride towards realization of\nsustainable smart cities and communities.",

    "abstract": "In computer-aided education and intelligent tutoring systems, knowledge\ntracing (KT) raises attention due to the development of data-driven learning\nmethods, which aims to predict students' future performance given their past\nquestion response sequences to trace their knowledge states. However, current\ndeep learning approaches only focus on enhancing prediction accuracy, but\nneglecting the discrimination imbalance of responses. That is, a considerable\nproportion of question responses are weak to discriminate students' knowledge\nstates, but equally considered compared to other discriminative responses, thus\nhurting the ability of tracing students' personalized knowledge states. To\ntackle this issue, we propose DR4KT for Knowledge Tracing, which reweights the\ncontribution of different responses according to their discrimination in\ntraining. For retaining high prediction accuracy on low discriminative\nresponses after reweighting, DR4KT also introduces a discrimination-aware score\nfusion technique to make a proper combination between student knowledge mastery\nand the questions themselves.

In this paper, we make\nthe first attempt to introduce the explicit 3D shape prior to CLIP-guided 3D\noptimization methods. Specifically, we first generate a high-quality 3D shape\nfrom input texts in the text-to-shape stage as the 3D shape prior. We then\nutilize it as the initialization of a neural radiance field and then optimize\nit with the full prompt. For the text-to-shape generation, we present a simple\nyet effective approach that directly bridges the text and image modalities with\na powerful text-to-image diffusion model. To narrow the style domain gap\nbetween images synthesized by the text-to-image model and shape renderings used\nto train the image-to-shape generator, we further propose to jointly optimize a\nlearnable text prompt and fine-tune the text-to-image diffusion model for\nrendering-style image generation.

    "abstract": "Extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) is a promising technique for future 6G\ncommunications. The sharp increase of the number of antennas causes the\nelectromagnetic propagation to change from far-field to near-field. Due to the\nnear-field effect, the exhaustive near-field beam training at all angles and\ndistances involves very high overhead. The improved fast near-field beam\ntraining scheme based on time-delay beamforming can significantly reduce the\noverhead, but it suffers from very high hardware cost and energy consumption\ncaused by extra time-delay circuits. In this paper, we propose a near-field two\ndimension (2D) hierarchical beam training scheme to reduce the overhead without\nextra hardware circuits. Specifically, we first formulate the near-field\ncodeword design problem for any required high or low resolutions with different\nangle and distance coverages. Next, we propose a Gerchberg-Saxton (GS)-based\nalgorithm to obtain the unconstrained codeword by considering the ideal fully\ndigital architecture. Based on the unconstrained codeword, an iterative\noptimization algorithm is then proposed to acquire the practical codeword by\nconsidering the more practical hybrid digital-analog architecture. Finally,\nwith the help of the practical multi-resolution codebooks, we propose a\nnear-field 2D hierarchical beam training scheme to significantly reduce the\ntraining overhead, which is verified by extensive simulation results.",

    "abstract": "This paper concerns the study of optimal (supremum and infimum) uncertainty\nbounds for systems where the input (or prior) probability measure is only\npartially/imperfectly known (e.g., with only statistical moments and/or on a\ncoarse topology) rather than fully specified. Such partial knowledge provides\nconstraints on the input probability measures. The theory of Optimal\nUncertainty Quantification allows us to convert the task into a constraint\noptimization problem where one seeks to compute the least upper/greatest lower\nbound of the system's output uncertainties by finding the extremal probability\nmeasure of the input. Such optimization requires repeated evaluation of the\nsystem's performance indicator (input to performance map) and is\nhigh-dimensional and non-convex by nature. Therefore, it is difficult to find\nthe optimal uncertainty bounds in practice. In this paper, we examine the use\nof machine learning, especially deep neural networks, to address the challenge.\nWe achieve this by introducing a neural network classifier to approximate the\nperformance indicator combined with the stochastic gradient descent method to\nsolve the optimization problem. We demonstrate the learning based framework on\nthe uncertainty quantification of the impact of magnesium alloys, which are\npromising light-weight structural and protective materials. Finally, we show\nthat the approach can be used to construct maps for the performance certificate\nand safety design in engineering practice.",

In those\ncircumstances, it seems important to provide policy makers both with a useful,\nbalanced summary that is representative of opinion in the field large, and to\ntransparently communicate the actual evidence-base. To this end, we propose the\ncompilation of argument maps through a collective intelligence process; these\nmaps are then given to a wide sample of the relevant research community for\nevaluation and summary opinion in an IGM style IGM style poll (see\nigmchicago.org), which provides a representative view of opinion on the issue\nat stake within the wider scientific community.

Such a process would help\novercome the resource limitations of the traditional expert advice process,\nwhile also providing greater balance by drawing on the expertise of researchers\nbeyond the leading proponents of particular theories within a field. And, the\nactual evidence base would be transparent. In this paper, we present a pilot\nproject stepping through the map building component of such a policy advice\nscheme.

The basis of our method is to first generate a low frame rate\nsmoke simulation, then increase the frame rate using temporal interpolation.\nHowever, low frame rate smoke simulations are inaccurate as they require\nincreasing the time-step. A simulation with a larger time-step produces results\ndifferent from that of the original simulation with a small time-step.\nTherefore, the proposed method corrects the large time-step simulation results\ncloser to the corresponding small time-step simulation results using a\nU-Net-based DNN model. To obtain more precise results, we applied modeling\nconcepts used in the image domain, such as optical flow and perceptual loss. By\ncorrecting the large time-step simulation results and interpolating between\nthem, the proposed method can efficiently and accurately generate high frame\nrate smoke simulations. We conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses to\nconfirm the effectiveness of the proposed model. Our analyses show that our\nmethod reduces the mean squared error of large time-step simulation results by\nmore than 80% on average.

However, many of the defining assumptions regarding data-stream\nlearning tasks are too strong to hold in practice, or are even contradictory\nsuch that they cannot be met in the contexts of supervised learning. Algorithms\nare chosen and designed based on criteria which are often not clearly stated,\nfor problem settings not clearly defined, tested in unrealistic settings,\nand/or in isolation from related approaches in the wider literature. This puts\ninto question the potential for real-world impact of many approaches conceived\nin such contexts, and risks propagating a misguided research focus. We propose\nto tackle these issues by reformulating the fundamental definitions and\nsettings of supervised data-stream learning with regard to contemporary\nconsiderations of concept drift and temporal dependence; and we take a fresh\nlook at what constitutes a supervised data-stream learning task, and a\nreconsideration of algorithms that may be applied to tackle such tasks. Through\nand in reflection of this formulation and overview, helped by an informal\nsurvey of industrial players dealing with real-world data streams, we provide\nrecommendations. Our main emphasis is that learning from data streams does not\nimpose a single-pass or online-learning approach, or any particular learning\nregime; and any constraints on memory and time are not specific to streaming.\nMeanwhile, there exist established techniques for dealing with temporal\ndependence and concept drift, in other areas of the literature. For the data\nstreams community, we thus encourage a shift in research focus, from dealing\nwith often-artificial constraints and assumptions on the learning mode, to\nissues such as robustness, privacy, and interpretability which are increasingly\nrelevant to learning in data streams in academic and industrial settings.",

Another drawback is that that distribution\nparameters (mean and standard deviation) are unlike all other model parameters\nin that they are not trained using gradient descent but require special\ntreatment, complicating implementation. In this paper, I show a simple and\nstraightforward way to address these issues.

    "abstract": "Due to the environmental impacts caused by the construction industry,\nrepurposing existing buildings and making them more energy-efficient has become\na high-priority issue. However, a legitimate concern of land developers is\nassociated with the buildings' state of conservation. For that reason, infrared\nthermography has been used as a powerful tool to characterize these buildings'\nstate of conservation by detecting pathologies, such as cracks and humidity.\nThermal cameras detect the radiation emitted by any material and translate it\ninto temperature-color-coded images. Abnormal temperature changes may indicate\nthe presence of pathologies, however, reading thermal images might not be quite\nsimple. This research project aims to combine infrared thermography and machine\nlearning (ML) to help stakeholders determine the viability of reusing existing\nbuildings by identifying their pathologies and defects more efficiently and\naccurately. In this particular phase of this research project, we've used an\nimage classification machine learning model of Convolutional Neural Networks\n(DCNN) to differentiate three levels of cracks in one particular building. The\nmodel's accuracy was compared between the MSX and thermal images acquired from\ntwo distinct thermal cameras and fused images (formed through multisource\ninformation) to test the influence of the input data and network on the\ndetection results.",

    "abstract": "It is indisputable that physical activity is vital for an individual's health\nand wellness. However, a global prevalence of physical inactivity has induced\nsignificant personal and socioeconomic implications. In recent years, a\nsignificant amount of work has showcased the capabilities of self-tracking\ntechnology to create positive health behavior change. This work is motivated by\nthe potential of personalized and adaptive goal-setting techniques in\nencouraging physical activity via self-tracking. To this end, we propose\nUBIWEAR, an end-to-end framework for intelligent physical activity prediction,\nwith the ultimate goal to empower data-driven goal-setting interventions. To\nachieve this, we experiment with numerous machine learning and deep learning\nparadigms as a robust benchmark for physical activity prediction tasks. To\ntrain our models, we utilize, \"MyHeart Counts\", an open, large-scale dataset\ncollected in-the-wild from thousands of users. We also propose a prescriptive\nframework for self-tracking aggregated data preprocessing, to facilitate data\nwrangling of real-world, noisy data. Our best model achieves a MAE of 1087\nsteps, 65% lower than the state of the art in terms of absolute error, proving\nthe feasibility of the physical activity prediction task, and paving the way\nfor future research.",

    "abstract": "Compliance in actuation has been exploited to generate highly dynamic\nmaneuvers such as throwing that take advantage of the potential energy stored\nin joint springs. However, the energy storage and release could not be\nwell-timed yet. On the contrary, for multi-link systems, the natural system\ndynamics might even work against the actual goal. With the introduction of\nvariable stiffness actuators, this problem has been partially addressed. With a\nsuitable optimal control strategy, the approximate decoupling of the motor from\nthe link can be achieved to maximize the energy transfer into the distal link\nprior to launch. However, such continuous stiffness variation is complex and\ntypically leads to oscillatory swing-up motions instead of clear launch\nsequences. To circumvent this issue, we investigate decoupling for speed\nmaximization with a dedicated novel actuator concept denoted Bi-Stiffness\nActuation. With this, it is possible to fully decouple the link from the joint\nmechanism by a switch-and-hold clutch and simultaneously keep the elastic\nenergy stored. We show that with this novel paradigm, it is not only possible\nto reach the same optimal performance as with power-equivalent variable\nstiffness actuation, but even directly control the energy transfer timing. This\nis a major step forward compared to previous optimal control approaches, which\nrely on optimizing the full time-series control input.",

    "abstract": "Automatic font generation without human experts is a practical and\nsignificant problem, especially for some languages that consist of a large\nnumber of characters. Existing methods for font generation are often in\nsupervised learning. They require a large number of paired data, which are\nlabor-intensive and expensive to collect. In contrast, common unsupervised\nimage-to-image translation methods are not applicable to font generation, as\nthey often define style as the set of textures and colors. In this work, we\npropose a robust deformable generative network for unsupervised font generation\n(abbreviated as DGFont++). We introduce a feature deformation skip connection\n(FDSC) to learn local patterns and geometric transformations between fonts. The\nFDSC predicts pairs of displacement maps and employs the predicted maps to\napply deformable convolution to the low-level content feature maps. The outputs\nof FDSC are fed into a mixer to generate final results. Moreover, we introduce\ncontrastive self-supervised learning to learn a robust style representation for\nfonts by understanding the similarity and dissimilarities of fonts. To\ndistinguish different styles, we train our model with a multi-task\ndiscriminator, which ensures that each style can be discriminated\nindependently. In addition to adversarial loss, another two reconstruction\nlosses are adopted to constrain the domain-invariant characteristics between\ngenerated images and content images. Taking advantage of FDSC and the adopted\nloss functions, our model is able to maintain spatial information and generates\nhigh-quality character images in an unsupervised manner. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our model is able to generate character images of higher\nquality than state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Classical reinforcement learning (RL) techniques are generally concerned with\nthe design of decision-making policies driven by the maximisation of the\nexpected outcome. Nevertheless, this approach does not take into consideration\nthe potential risk associated with the actions taken, which may be critical in\ncertain applications. To address that issue, the present research work\nintroduces a novel methodology based on distributional RL to derive sequential\ndecision-making policies that are sensitive to the risk, the latter being\nmodelled by the tail of the return probability distribution. The core idea is\nto replace the $Q$ function generally standing at the core of learning schemes\nin RL by another function taking into account both the expected return and the\nrisk. Named the risk-based utility function $U$, it can be extracted from the\nrandom return distribution $Z$ naturally learnt by any distributional RL\nalgorithm. This enables to span the complete potential trade-off between risk\nminimisation and expected return maximisation, in contrast to fully risk-averse\nmethodologies. Fundamentally, this research yields a truly practical and\naccessible solution for learning risk-sensitive policies with minimal\nmodification to the distributional RL algorithm, and with an emphasis on the\ninterpretability of the resulting decision-making process.",

    "abstract": "Technology advancements in wireless communications and high-performance\nExtended Reality (XR) have empowered the developments of the Metaverse. The\ndemand for Metaverse applications and hence, real-time digital twinning of\nreal-world scenes is increasing. Nevertheless, the replication of 2D physical\nworld images into 3D virtual world scenes is computationally intensive and\nrequires computation offloading. The disparity in transmitted scene dimension\n(2D as opposed to 3D) leads to asymmetric data sizes in uplink (UL) and\ndownlink (DL). To ensure the reliability and low latency of the system, we\nconsider an asynchronous joint UL-DL scenario where in the UL stage, the\nsmaller data size of the physical world scenes captured by multiple extended\nreality users (XUs) will be uploaded to the Metaverse Console (MC) to be\nconstrued and rendered. In the DL stage, the larger-size 3D virtual world\nscenes need to be transmitted back to the XUs. The decisions pertaining to\ncomputation offloading and channel assignment are optimized in the UL stage,\nand the MC will optimize power allocation for users assigned with a channel in\nthe UL transmission stage. Some problems arise therefrom: (i) interactive\nmulti-process chain, specifically Asynchronous Markov Decision Process (AMDP),\n(ii) joint optimization in multiple processes, and (iii) high-dimensional\nobjective functions, or hybrid reward scenarios. To ensure the reliability and\nlow latency of the system, we design a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning\nalgorithm structure, namely Asynchronous Actors Hybrid Critic (AAHC).

Deep learning-based state-of-the-art\nmethods for LiDAR MOS strongly depend on annotated ground truth data, which is\nexpensive to obtain and scarce in existence. To close this gap in the\nstationary setting, we propose a novel 4D LiDAR representation based on\nmultivariate time series that relaxes the problem of unsupervised MOS to a time\nseries clustering problem. More specifically, we propose modeling the change in\noccupancy of a voxel by a multivariate occupancy time series (MOTS), which\ncaptures spatio-temporal occupancy changes on the voxel level and its\nsurrounding neighborhood. To perform unsupervised MOS, we train a neural\nnetwork in a self-supervised manner to encode MOTS into voxel-level feature\nrepresentations, which can be partitioned by a clustering algorithm into moving\nor stationary.

The goal is to determine the optimal\nselection and timing of a set of zones to include in a service region. However,\nprior work required explicit enumeration of all possible sequences of\ninvestments. To address the combinatorial complexity of such enumeration, we\npropose a new variant \"deep\" RO policy using an efficient recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN) based ML method (CR-RNN policy) to sample sequences to forego the\nneed for enumeration, making network design & timing policy tractable for large\nscale implementation. Experiments on multiple service region scenarios in New\nYork City (NYC) shows the proposed policy substantially reduces the overall\ncomputational cost (time reduction for RO evaluation of > 90% of total\ninvestment sequences is achieved), with zero to near-zero gap compared to the\nbenchmark. A case study of sequential service region design for expansion of\nMoD services in Brooklyn, NYC show that using the CR-RNN policy to determine\noptimal RO investment strategy yields a similar performance (0.5% within CR\npolicy value) with significantly reduced computation time (about 5.4 times\nfaster).",

    "abstract": "Photo exposure correction is widely investigated, but fewer studies focus on\ncorrecting under and over-exposed images simultaneously. Three issues remain\nopen to handle and correct under and over-exposed images in a unified way.\nFirst, a locally-adaptive exposure adjustment may be more flexible instead of\nlearning a global mapping. Second, it is an ill-posed problem to determine the\nsuitable exposure values locally. Third, photos with the same content but\ndifferent exposures may not reach consistent adjustment results. To this end,\nwe proposed a novel exposure correction network, ExReg, to address the\nchallenges by formulating exposure correction as a multi-dimensional regression\nprocess. Given an input image, a compact multi-exposure generation network is\nintroduced to generate images with different exposure conditions for\nmulti-dimensional regression and exposure correction in the next stage. An\nauxiliary module is designed to predict the region-wise exposure values,\nguiding the mainly proposed Encoder-Decoder ANP (Attentive Neural Processes) to\nregress the final corrected image. The experimental results show that ExReg can\ngenerate well-exposed results and outperform the SOTA method by 1.3dB in PSNR\nfor extensive exposure problems. In addition, given the same image but under\nvarious exposure for testing, the corrected results are more visually\nconsistent and physically accurate.",

Design tradeoffs include the\ngain-FOV tradeoff for each receiver element and the area-bandwidth tradeoff for\neach PD array.

    "abstract": "Detecting bugs in Deep Learning (DL) libraries is critical for almost all\ndownstream DL systems in ensuring effectiveness and safety for the end users.\nAs such, researchers have started developing various fuzzing or testing\ntechniques targeting DL libraries. Previous work can be mainly classified into\nAPI-level fuzzing and model-level fuzzing. However, both types of techniques\ncannot detect bugs that can only be exposed by complex API sequences -\nAPI-level fuzzers cannot cover API sequences, while model-level fuzzers can\nonly cover specific API sequence patterns and a small subset of APIs due to\ncomplicated input/shape constraints for tensor computations. To address these\nlimitations, we propose LLMFuzz - the first automated approach to directly\nleveraging Large Pre-trained Language Models (LLMs) to generate input programs\nfor fuzzing DL libraries. LLMs are trained on billions of code snippets and can\nautoregressively generate human-like code snippets. Our key insight is that\nmodern LLMs can also include numerous code snippets invoking DL library APIs in\ntheir training corpora, and thus can implicitly learn the intricate DL API\nconstraints and directly generate/mutate valid DL programs for fuzzing DL\nlibraries. More specifically, we first directly use a generative LLM (e.g.,\nCodex) to generate highquality seed programs based on input prompts. Then, we\nleverage an evolutionary fuzzing loop which applies an infilling LLM (e.g.,\nInCoder) to further perform small mutations on the seed programs to generate\nmore diverse API sequences for fuzzing DL libraries. Our experimental results\non popular DL libraries demonstrate that LLMFuzz is able to cover 91.11% /\n24.09% more APIs and achieve 30.38% / 50.84% higher code coverage than\nstate-of-the-art fuzzers on TensorFlow / PyTorch. Furthermore, LLMFuzz is able\nto detect 65 bugs, with 41 already confirmed as previously unknown bugs.",

On the other hand, deep learning has shown how to use priors in order\nto infer shape from single images. Such approaches, though, require that the\nobject is reconstructed in a canonical pose or assume that object pose is known\nduring training. In this paper, we address the problem of how to compute\nequivariant priors for reconstruction from a few images, given the relative\nposes of the cameras. Our proposed reconstruction is $SE(3)$-gauge equivariant,\nmeaning that it is equivariant to the choice of world frame. To achieve this,\nwe make two novel contributions to light field processing: we define light\nfield convolution and we show how it can be approximated by intra-view $SE(2)$\nconvolutions because the original light field convolution is computationally\nand memory-wise intractable; we design a map from the light field to\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$ that is equivariant to the transformation of the world frame and\nto the rotation of the views. We demonstrate equivariance by obtaining robust\nresults in roto-translated datasets without performing transformation\naugmentation.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial training is an effective approach to make deep neural networks\nrobust against adversarial attacks. Recently, different adversarial training\ndefenses are proposed that not only maintain a high clean accuracy but also\nshow significant robustness against popular and well studied adversarial\nattacks such as PGD. High adversarial robustness can also arise if an attack\nfails to find adversarial gradient directions, a phenomenon known as `gradient\nmasking'. In this work, we analyse the effect of label smoothing on adversarial\ntraining as one of the potential causes of gradient masking. We then develop a\nguided mechanism to avoid local minima during attack optimization, leading to a\nnovel attack dubbed Guided Projected Gradient Attack (G-PGA). Our attack\napproach is based on a `match and deceive' loss that finds optimal adversarial\ndirections through guidance from a surrogate model. Our modified attack does\nnot require random restarts, large number of attack iterations or search for an\noptimal step-size. Furthermore, our proposed G-PGA is generic, thus it can be\ncombined with an ensemble attack strategy as we demonstrate for the case of\nAuto-Attack, leading to efficiency and convergence speed improvements. More\nthan an effective attack, G-PGA can be used as a diagnostic tool to reveal\nelusive robustness due to gradient masking in adversarial defenses.",

As a solution, In-Band Network Telemetry (INT) framework\nhas been recently proposed to collect network telemetry information more\nautonomously and distributedly by employing programmable switches. However, it\nimposes further challenges to (i) find suitable INT paths to optimize the\ncontrol overhead and information freshness and (ii) ensure reliable delivery of\ncontrol information over multi-hop INT paths. In this work, we propose a\nmonitoring scheme, reliable Graph Partitioned INT (GPINT), by extending our\nprevious work and integrating shared queue ring (SQR) as a reliability feature\nagainst potential failures in network telemetry collection due to network\ncongestion and link degradation that may cause loss of the visibility of the\nnetwork. We implement our proposal in a recent data plane programming language\nP4, and compare it with traditional Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)\nand also another state-of-the-art study employing Euler's method for INT path\ngeneration. Our analysis first shows the importance of having a data recovery\nmechanism against packet losses under different network conditions.

In particular, we use the time\nneeded to reach the synchronization as a proxy for the spatial heterogeneity of\na socioeconomic feature, as for example, the income. Our analysis for 16~income\ncategories in cities from the United States reveals that the spatial\ndistribution of the most deprived and affluent citizens leads to higher\ndiffusion and synchronization times. By measuring the time needed for a\nneighborhood to reach the global phase we are able to detect those that suffer\nfrom a steeper segregation.

    "abstract": "Video Super-Resolution (VSR) aims to restore high-resolution (HR) videos from\nlow-resolution (LR) videos. Existing VSR techniques usually recover HR frames\nby extracting pertinent textures from nearby frames with known degradation\nprocesses. Despite significant progress, grand challenges are remained to\neffectively extract and transmit high-quality textures from high-degraded\nlow-quality sequences, such as blur, additive noises, and compression\nartifacts. In this work, a novel Frequency-Transformer (FTVSR) is proposed for\nhandling low-quality videos that carry out self-attention in a combined\nspace-time-frequency domain. First, video frames are split into patches and\neach patch is transformed into spectral maps in which each channel represents a\nfrequency band. It permits a fine-grained self-attention on each frequency\nband, so that real visual texture can be distinguished from artifacts. Second,\na novel dual frequency attention (DFA) mechanism is proposed to capture the\nglobal frequency relations and local frequency relations, which can handle\ndifferent complicated degradation processes in real-world scenarios. Third, we\nexplore different self-attention schemes for video processing in the frequency\ndomain and discover that a ``divided attention'' which conducts a joint\nspace-frequency attention before applying temporal-frequency attention, leads\nto the best video enhancement quality.

    "title": "A Data-Adaptive Prior for Bayesian Learning of Kernels in Operators",
    "abstract": "Kernels are efficient in representing nonlocal dependence and they are widely\nused to design operators between function spaces. Thus, learning kernels in\noperators from data is an inverse problem of general interest. Due to the\nnonlocal dependence, the inverse problem can be severely ill-posed with a\ndata-dependent singular inversion operator. The Bayesian approach overcomes the\nill-posedness through a non-degenerate prior. However, a fixed non-degenerate\nprior leads to a divergent posterior mean when the observation noise becomes\nsmall, if the data induces a perturbation in the eigenspace of zero eigenvalues\nof the inversion operator. We introduce a data-adaptive prior to achieve a\nstable posterior whose mean always has a small noise limit. The data-adaptive\nprior's covariance is the inversion operator with a hyper-parameter selected\nadaptive to data by the L-curve method. Furthermore, we provide a detailed\nanalysis on the computational practice of the data-adaptive prior, and\ndemonstrate it on Toeplitz matrices and integral operators. Numerical tests\nshow that a fixed prior can lead to a divergent posterior mean in the presence\nof any of the four types of errors: discretization error, model error, partial\nobservation and wrong noise assumption. In contrast, the data-adaptive prior\nalways attains posterior means with small noise limits.",

This\nover-confidence in a single model can be potentially mitigated with Bayesian\ninference over the model parameters that take into account epistemic\nuncertainty. This paper investigates three approaches to Bayesian inference:\nstochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo, Bayes by Backpropagation, and\nStochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian. The inference is implemented over the\nweights of the deep neural networks that parameterize the likelihood of the\nVariational Autoencoder. We empirically evaluate the approaches against several\nbenchmarks that are often used for OoD detection: estimation of the marginal\nlikelihood utilizing sampled model ensemble, typicality test, disagreement\nscore, and Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion.

These models are made up of a quantum part and a\nclassical part. The quantum part is given by a parametrization $U$, which, in\ngeneral, is obtained from the product of different quantum gates. By its turn,\nthe classical part corresponds to an optimizer that updates the parameters of\n$U$ in order to minimize a cost function $C$. However, despite the many\napplications of VQCs, there are still questions to be answered, such as for\nexample: What is the best sequence of gates to be used? How to optimize their\nparameters? Which cost function to use? How the architecture of the quantum\nchips influences the final results? In this article, we focus on answering the\nlast question. We will show that, in general, the cost function will tend to a\ntypical average value the closer the parameterization used is from a\n$2$-design. Therefore, the closer this parameterization is to a $2$-design, the\nless the result of the quantum neural network model will depend on its\nparametrization.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating a multivariate function $f_0$ of\nbounded variation (BV), from noisy observations $y_i = f_0(x_i) + z_i$ made at\nrandom design points $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, $i=1,\\ldots,n$. We study an\nestimator that forms the Voronoi diagram of the design points, and then solves\nan optimization problem that regularizes according to a certain discrete notion\nof total variation (TV): the sum of weighted absolute differences of parameters\n$\\theta_i,\\theta_j$ (which estimate the function values $f_0(x_i),f_0(x_j)$) at\nall neighboring cells $i,j$ in the Voronoi diagram. This is seen to be\nequivalent to a variational optimization problem that regularizes according to\nthe usual continuum (measure-theoretic) notion of TV, once we restrict the\ndomain to functions that are piecewise constant over the Voronoi diagram.\nThe regression estimator under consideration hence performs (shrunken) local\naveraging over adaptively formed unions of Voronoi cells, and we refer to it as\nthe Voronoigram, following the ideas in Koenker (2005), and drawing inspiration\nfrom Tukey's regressogram (Tukey, 1961). Our contributions in this paper span\nboth the conceptual and theoretical frontiers: we discuss some of the unique\nproperties of the Voronoigram in comparison to TV-regularized estimators that\nuse other graph-based discretizations; we derive the asymptotic limit of the\nVoronoi TV functional; and we prove that the Voronoigram is minimax rate\noptimal (up to log factors) for estimating BV functions that are essentially\nbounded.",

    "title": "ResGrad: Residual Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Text to  Speech",
    "abstract": "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) are emerging in\ntext-to-speech (TTS) synthesis because of their strong capability of generating\nhigh-fidelity samples. However, their iterative refinement process in\nhigh-dimensional data space results in slow inference speed, which restricts\ntheir application in real-time systems. Previous works have explored speeding\nup by minimizing the number of inference steps but at the cost of sample\nquality. In this work, to improve the inference speed for DDPM-based TTS model\nwhile achieving high sample quality, we propose ResGrad, a lightweight\ndiffusion model which learns to refine the output spectrogram of an existing\nTTS model (e.g., FastSpeech 2) by predicting the residual between the model\noutput and the corresponding ground-truth speech. ResGrad has several\nadvantages: 1) Compare with other acceleration methods for DDPM which need to\nsynthesize speech from scratch, ResGrad reduces the complexity of task by\nchanging the generation target from ground-truth mel-spectrogram to the\nresidual, resulting into a more lightweight model and thus a smaller real-time\nfactor. 2) ResGrad is employed in the inference process of the existing TTS\nmodel in a plug-and-play way, without re-training this model. We verify ResGrad\non the single-speaker dataset LJSpeech and two more challenging datasets with\nmultiple speakers (LibriTTS) and high sampling rate (VCTK). Experimental\nresults show that in comparison with other speed-up methods of DDPMs: 1)\nResGrad achieves better sample quality with the same inference speed measured\nby real-time factor; 2) with similar speech quality, ResGrad synthesizes speech\nfaster than baseline methods by more than 10 times.

    "abstract": "Within smart manufacturing, data driven techniques are commonly adopted for\ncondition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Classical\napproaches use supervised learning where a classifier is trained on labeled\ndata to predict or classify different operational states of the machine.\nHowever, in most industrial applications, labeled data is limited in terms of\nits size and type. Hence, it cannot serve the training purpose. In this paper,\nthis problem is tackled by addressing the classification task as a similarity\nmeasure to a reference sample rather than a supervised classification task.\nSimilarity-based approaches require a limited amount of labeled data and hence,\nmeet the requirements of real-world industrial applications. Accordingly, the\npaper introduces a similarity-based framework for predictive maintenance (PdM)\nof rotating machinery. For each operational state of the machine, a reference\nvibration signal is generated and labeled according to the machine's\noperational condition. Consequentially, statistical time analysis, fast Fourier\ntransform (FFT), and short-time Fourier transform (STFT) are used to extract\nfeatures from the captured vibration signals. For each feature type, three\nsimilarity metrics, namely structural similarity measure (SSM), cosine\nsimilarity, and Euclidean distance are used to measure the similarity between\ntest signals and reference signals in the feature space. Hence, nine settings\nin terms of feature type-similarity measure combinations are evaluated.\nExperimental results confirm the effectiveness of similarity-based approaches\nin achieving very high accuracy with moderate computational requirements\ncompared to machine learning (ML)-based methods. Further, the results indicate\nthat using FFT features with cosine similarity would lead to better performance\ncompared to the other settings.",

A key task in passive\nmonitoring is multiobject tracking (MOT). This paper presents a Bayesian method\nfor multisensor MOT for challenging tracking problems where the object states\nare high-dimensional, and the measurements follow a nonlinear model. Our method\nis developed in the framework of factor graphs and the sum-product algorithm\n(SPA). The multimodal probability density functions (pdfs) provided by the SPA\nare effectively represented by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). To perform the\noperations of the SPA in high-dimensional spaces, we make use of Particle flow\n(PFL). Here, particles are migrated towards regions of high likelihood based on\nthe solution of a partial differential equation. This makes it possible to\nobtain good object detection and tracking performance even in challenging\nmultisensor MOT scenarios with single sensor measurements that have a lower\ndimension than the object positions. We perform a numerical evaluation in a\npassive acoustic monitoring scenario where multiple sources are tracked in 3-D\nfrom 1-D time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements provided by pairs of\nhydrophones.

We propose to truncate and properly dither the\ndata prior to a uniform quantization. Our major standpoint is that (near)\nminimax rates of estimation error are achievable merely from the quantized data\nproduced by the proposed scheme. In particular, concrete results are worked out\nfor covariance estimation, compressed sensing, and matrix completion, all\nagreeing that the quantization only slightly worsens the multiplicative factor.\nBesides, we study compressed sensing where both covariate (i.e., sensing\nvector) and response are quantized. Under covariate quantization, although our\nrecovery program is non-convex because the covariance matrix estimator lacks\npositive semi-definiteness, all local minimizers are proved to enjoy near\noptimal error bound. Moreover, by the concentration inequality of product\nprocess and covering argument, we establish near minimax uniform recovery\nguarantee for quantized compressed sensing with heavy-tailed noise.",

It is therefore of\nparamount importance to quantify the uncertainties associated to the inversion\nprocess to ease the subsequent interpretation and decision making processes.\nWithin this framework of reference, sampling from a target posterior provides a\nfundamental approach to quantifying the uncertainty in seismic inversion.\nHowever, selecting appropriate prior information in a probabilistic inversion\nis crucial, yet non-trivial, as it influences the ability of a sampling-based\ninference in providing geological realism in the posterior samples.

Among them, decomposition-based methods have achieved promising\nresults. Most decomposition-based methods approximate a single function, which\nis insufficient for obtaining accurate results. Moreover, most existing\nresearches have concentrated on one-step-ahead forecasting that prevents stock\nmarket investors from arriving at the best decisions for the future. This study\nproposes two novel methods for multi-step-ahead stock price prediction based on\nthe issues outlined. DCT-MFRFNN, a method based on discrete cosine transform\n(DCT) and multi-functional recurrent fuzzy neural network (MFRFNN), uses DCT to\nreduce fluctuations in the time series and simplify its structure and MFRFNN to\npredict the stock price. VMD-MFRFNN, an approach based on variational mode\ndecomposition (VMD) and MFRFNN, brings together their advantages. VMD-MFRFNN\nconsists of two phases. The input signal is decomposed to several IMFs using\nVMD in the decomposition phase. In the prediction and reconstruction phase,\neach of the IMFs is given to a separate MFRFNN for prediction, and predicted\nsignals are summed to reconstruct the output. Three financial time series,\nincluding Hang Seng Index (HSI), Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), and Standard &\nPoor's 500 Index (SPX), are used for the evaluation of the proposed methods.\nExperimental results indicate that VMD-MFRFNN surpasses other state-of-the-art\nmethods. VMD-MFRFNN, on average, shows 35.93%, 24.88%, and 34.59% decreases in\nRMSE from the second-best model for HSI, SSE, and SPX, respectively. Also,\nDCT-MFRFNN outperforms MFRFNN in all experiments.",

    "abstract": "This short study reformulates the statistical Bayesian learning problem using\na quantum mechanics framework. Density operators representing ensembles of pure\nstates of sample wave functions are used in place probability densities. We\nshow that such representation allows to formulate the statistical Bayesian\nlearning problem in different coordinate systems on the sample space. We\nfurther show that such representation allows to learn projections of density\noperators using a kernel trick. In particular, the study highlights that\ndecomposing wave functions rather than probability densities, as it is done in\nkernel embedding, allows to preserve the nature of probability operators.\nResults are illustrated with a simple example using discrete orthogonal wavelet\ntransform of density operators.",

    "title": "NISQ-ready community detection based on separation-node identification",
    "abstract": "The analysis of network structure is essential to many scientific areas,\nranging from biology to sociology. As the computational task of clustering\nthese networks into partitions, i.e., solving the community detection problem,\nis generally NP-hard, heuristic solutions are indispensable. The exploration of\nexpedient heuristics has led to the development of particularly promising\napproaches in the emerging technology of quantum computing. Motivated by the\nsubstantial hardware demands for all established quantum community detection\napproaches, we introduce a novel QUBO based approach that only needs\nnumber-of-nodes many qubits and is represented by a QUBO-matrix as sparse as\nthe input graph's adjacency matrix. The substantial improvement on the sparsity\nof the QUBO-matrix, which is typically very dense in related work, is achieved\nthrough the novel concept of separation-nodes. Instead of assigning every node\nto a community directly, this approach relies on the identification of a\nseparation-node set, which -- upon its removal from the graph -- yields a set\nof connected components, representing the core components of the communities.\nEmploying a greedy heuristic to assign the nodes from the separation-node sets\nto the identified community cores, subsequent experimental results yield a\nproof of concept. This work hence displays a promising approach to NISQ ready\nquantum community detection, catalyzing the application of quantum computers\nfor the network structure analysis of large scale, real world problem\ninstances.",

    "title": "Superiorization: The asymmetric roles of feasibility-seeking and  objective function reduction",
    "abstract": "The superiorization methodology can be thought of as lying conceptually\nbetween feasibility-seeking and constrained minimization. It is not trying to\nsolve the full-fledged constrained minimization problem composed from the\nmodeling constraints and the chosen objective function. Rather, the task is to\nfind a feasible point which is \"superior\" (in a well-defined manner) with\nrespect to the objective function, to one returned by a feasibility-seeking\nonly algorithm. We telegraphically review the superiorization methodology and\nwhere it stands today and propose a rigorous formulation of its, yet only\npartially resolved, guarantee problem. The real-world situation in an\napplication field is commonly represented by constraints defined by the\nmodeling process and the data, obtained from measurements or otherwise dictated\nby the model-user. The feasibility-seeking problem requires to find a point in\nthe intersection of all constraints without using any objective function to aim\nat any specific feasible point. At the heart of the superiorization methodology\nlies the modeler desire to use an objective function, that is exogenous to the\nconstraints, in order to seek a feasible solution that will have lower (not\nnecessarily minimal) objective function value. This aim is less demanding than\nfull-fledged constrained minimization but more demanding than plain\nfeasibility-seeking. Putting emphasis on the need to satisfy the constraints,\nbecause they represent the real-world situation, one recognizes the \"asymmetric\nroles of feasibility-seeking and objective function reduction\", namely, that\nfulfilling the constraints is the main task while reduction of the exogenous\nobjective function plays only a secondary role. There are two research\ndirections in the superiorization methodology: Weak superiorization and strong\nsuperiorization.",

Early detection of pneumonia is essential for\nensuring curative care and boosting survival rates. The approach most usually\nused to diagnose pneumonia is chest X-ray imaging. The purpose of this work is\nto develop a method for the automatic diagnosis of bacterial and viral\npneumonia in digital x-ray pictures.

We\npropose VertMatch, a two-step framework to detect vertebral structures in 3D\nultrasound volume by utilizing unlabeled data in semi-supervised manner. The\nfirst step is to detect the possible positions of structures on transverse\nslice globally, and then the local patches are cropped based on detected\npositions. The second step is to distinguish whether the patches contain real\nvertebral structures and screen the predicted positions from the first step.\nVertMatch develops three novel components for semi-supervised learning: for\nposition detection in the first step, (1) anatomical prior is used to screen\npseudo labels generated from confidence threshold method; (2) multi-slice\nconsistency is used to utilize more unlabeled data by inputting multiple\nadjacent slices; (3) for patch identification in the second step, the\ncategories are rebalanced in each batch to solve imbalance problem.\nExperimental results demonstrate that VertMatch can detect vertebra accurately\nin ultrasound volume and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "With the fast development of big data, it has been easier than before to\nlearn the optimal decision rule by updating the decision rule recursively and\nmaking online decisions. We study the online statistical inference of model\nparameters in a contextual bandit framework of sequential decision-making. We\npropose a general framework for online and adaptive data collection environment\nthat can update decision rules via weighted stochastic gradient descent. We\nallow different weighting schemes of the stochastic gradient and establish the\nasymptotic normality of the parameter estimator. Our proposed estimator\nsignificantly improves the asymptotic efficiency over the previous averaged SGD\napproach via inverse probability weights. We also conduct an optimality\nanalysis on the weights in a linear regression setting. We provide a Bahadur\nrepresentation of the proposed estimator and show that the remainder term in\nthe Bahadur representation entails a slower convergence rate compared to\nclassical SGD due to the adaptive data collection.",
