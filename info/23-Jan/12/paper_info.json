    "title": "Analogical Relevance Index",
    "abstract": "Focusing on the most significant features of a dataset is useful both in\nmachine learning (ML) and data mining. In ML, it can lead to a higher accuracy,\na faster learning process, and ultimately a simpler and more understandable\nmodel. In data mining, identifying significant features is essential not only\nfor gaining a better understanding of the data but also for visualization. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate a new way of identifying significant features\ninspired by analogical proportions. Such a proportion is of the form of \"a is\nto b as c is to d\", comparing two pairs of items (a, b) and (c, d) in terms of\nsimilarities and dissimilarities. In a classification context, if the\nsimilarities/dissimilarities between a and b correlate with the fact that a and\nb have different labels, this knowledge can be transferred to c and d,\ninferring that c and d also have different labels. From a feature selection\nperspective, observing a huge number of such pairs (a, b) where a and b have\ndifferent labels provides a hint about the importance of the features where a\nand b differ. Following this idea, we introduce the Analogical Relevance Index\n(ARI), a new statistical test of the significance of a given feature with\nrespect to the label. ARI is a filter-based method. Filter-based methods are\nML-agnostic but generally unable to handle feature redundancy. However, ARI can\ndetect feature redundancy. Our experiments show that ARI is effective and\noutperforms well-known methods on a variety of artificial and some real\ndatasets.",

    "abstract": "Currently in the petroleum industry, operators often flare the produced gas\ninstead of commodifying it. The flaring magnitudes are large in some states,\nwhich constitute problems with energy waste and CO2 emissions. In North Dakota,\noperators are required to estimate and report the volume flared. The questions\nare, how good is the quality of this reporting, and what insights can be drawn\nfrom it? Apart from the company-reported statistics, which are available from\nthe North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC), flared volumes can be estimated\nvia satellite remote sensing, serving as an unbiased benchmark. Since\ninterpretation of the Landsat 8 imagery is hindered by artifacts due to glow,\nthe estimated volumes based on the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite\n(VIIRS) are used. Reverse geocoding is performed for comparing and contrasting\nthe NDIC and VIIRS data at different levels, such as county and oilfield. With\nall the data gathered and preprocessed, Bayesian learning implemented by MCMC\nmethods is performed to address three problems: county level model development,\nflaring time series analytics, and distribution estimation. First, there is\nheterogeneity among the different counties, in the associations between the\nNDIC and VIIRS volumes. In light of such, models are developed for each county\nby exploiting hierarchical models. Second, the flaring time series, albeit\nnoisy, contains information regarding trends and patterns, which provide some\ninsights into operator approaches. Gaussian processes are found to be effective\nin many different pattern recognition scenarios. Third, distributional insights\nare obtained through unsupervised learning. The negative binomial and GMMs are\nfound to effectively describe the oilfield flare count and flared volume\ndistributions, respectively. Finally, a nearest-neighbor-based approach for\noperator level monitoring and analytics is introduced.",

Semantic\nunits structure a knowledge graph into identifiable and semantically meaningful\nsubgraphs, each represented with its own resource that instantiates a\ncorresponding semantic unit class. Three categories of semantic units can be\ndistinguished: Statement units model individual propositions, compound units\nare semantically meaningful collections of semantic units, and question units\nmodel questions that translate into queries.

    "abstract": "Precision motion stages are playing a prominent role in various manufacturing\nequipment. The drastically increasing demand for higher throughput in\nintegrated circuit (IC) manufacturing and inspection calls for the\nnext-generation precision stages that have light weight and high control\nbandwidth simultaneously. In today's design techniques, the stage's first\nflexible mode is limiting its achievable control bandwidth, which enforces a\ntrade-off between the stage's acceleration and closed-loop stiffness and thus\nlimits the system's overall performance. To overcome this challenge, this paper\nproposes a new hardware design and control framework for lightweight precision\nmotion stages with the stage's low-frequency flexible modes actively\ncontrolled. Our method proposes to minimize the resonance frequency of the\ncontrolled mode to reduce the stage's weight, and to maximize that of the\nuncontrolled mode to enable high control bandwidth. In addition, the proposed\nframework determines the placement of the actuators and sensors to maximize the\ncontrollability/observability of the stage's controlled flexible mode while\nminimizing that of the uncontrolled mode, which effectively simplifies the\ncontroller designs. Two case studies are used to evaluate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed framework. Simulation results show that the stage designed using\nthe proposed method has a weight reduction of more than 55% compared to a\nbaseline stage design. Improvement in control bandwidth was also achieved.\nThese results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving\nlightweight precision positioning stages with high acceleration, bandwidth, and\nprecision.",

    "abstract": "Language models are known to learn a great quantity of factual information\nduring pretraining, and recent work localizes this information to specific\nmodel weights like mid-layer MLP weights (Meng et al., 2022). In this paper, we\nfind that we can change how a fact is stored in a model by editing weights that\nare in a different location than where existing methods suggest that the fact\nis stored. This is surprising because we would expect that localizing facts to\nspecific parameters in models would tell us where to manipulate knowledge in\nmodels, and this assumption has motivated past work on model editing methods.\nSpecifically, we show that localization conclusions from representation\ndenoising (also known as Causal Tracing) do not provide any insight into which\nmodel MLP layer would be best to edit in order to override an existing stored\nfact with a new one. This finding raises questions about how past work relies\non Causal Tracing to select which model layers to edit (Meng et al., 2022).\nNext, to better understand the discrepancy between representation denoising and\nweight editing, we develop several variants of the editing problem that appear\nmore and more like representation denoising in their design and objective.\nExperiments show that, for one of our editing problems, editing performance\ndoes relate to localization results from representation denoising, but we find\nthat which layer we edit is a far better predictor of performance. Our results\nsuggest, counterintuitively, that better mechanistic understanding of how\npretrained language models work may not always translate to insights about how\nto best change their behavior.

This\nway, we validate that the area covered by the floaters will capture the\nin-homogeneously in the velocity field. Exploration over a dataset of velocity\nfield maps that span over a year demonstrates the applicability of our\napproach, and shows a considerable improvement over the common approach of\nuniformly randomly choosing the initial deployment sites.

In outdoor environments, such\nreflections may not be available and prior work relied on dense base station\ndeployment or co-ordinated multi-point access to address outage problem.\nInstead of dense and hence cost-intensive network deployments, we found\nexperimentally that the mobile can capitalize on ground reflection. We\ndeveloped TERRA protocol to effectively handle mobile side beam direction\nduring transient blockage events. TERRA avoids outage during pedestrian\nblockages 84.5 $\\%$ of the time in outdoor environments on concrete and gravel\nsurfaces. TERRA also enables the mobile to perform a soft handover to a reserve\nneighbor base station in the event of a permanent blockage, without requiring\nany side information, unlike the existing works. Evaluations show that TERRA\nmaintains received signal strength close to the optimal solution while keeping\ntrack of the neighbor base station.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation proposes a framework of user-centered security in Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP), and demonstrates how it can improve the\naccessibility of related research. Accordingly, it focuses on two security\ndomains within NLP with great public interest. First, that of author profiling,\nwhich can be employed to compromise online privacy through invasive inferences.\nWithout access and detailed insight into these models' predictions, there is no\nreasonable heuristic by which Internet users might defend themselves from such\ninferences. Secondly, that of cyberbullying detection, which by default\npresupposes a centralized implementation; i.e., content moderation across\nsocial platforms. As access to appropriate data is restricted, and the nature\nof the task rapidly evolves (both through lexical variation, and cultural\nshifts), the effectiveness of its classifiers is greatly diminished and thereby\noften misrepresented.\nUnder the proposed framework, we predominantly investigate the use of\nadversarial attacks on language; i.e., changing a given input (generating\nadversarial samples) such that a given model does not function as intended.\nThese attacks form a common thread between our user-centered security problems;\nthey are highly relevant for privacy-preserving obfuscation methods against\nauthor profiling, and adversarial samples might also prove useful to assess the\ninfluence of lexical variation and augmentation on cyberbullying detection.",

    "abstract": "We adapt image inpainting techniques to impute large, irregular missing\nregions in urban settings characterized by sparsity, variance in both space and\ntime, and anomalous events. Missing regions in urban data can be caused by\nsensor or software failures, data quality issues, interference from weather\nevents, incomplete data collection, or varying data use regulations; any\nmissing data can render the entire dataset unusable for downstream\napplications. To ensure coverage and utility, we adapt computer vision\ntechniques for image inpainting to operate on 3D histograms (2D space + 1D\ntime) commonly used for data exchange in urban settings.\nAdapting these techniques to the spatiotemporal setting requires handling\nskew: urban data tend to follow population density patterns (small dense\nregions surrounded by large sparse areas); these patterns can dominate the\nlearning process and fool the model into ignoring local or transient effects.\nTo combat skew, we 1) train simultaneously in space and time, and 2) focus\nattention on dense regions by biasing the masks used for training to the skew\nin the data. We evaluate the core model and these two extensions using the NYC\ntaxi data and the NYC bikeshare data, simulating different conditions for\nmissing data. We show that the core model is effective qualitatively and\nquantitatively, and that biased masking during training reduces error in a\nvariety of scenarios. We also articulate a tradeoff in varying the number of\ntimesteps per training sample: too few timesteps and the model ignores\ntransient events; too many timesteps and the model is slow to train with\nlimited performance gain.",

    "abstract": "Logging is a common practice in traditional software development. Several\nresearch works have been done to investigate the different characteristics of\nlogging practices in traditional software systems (e.g., Android applications,\nJAVA applications, C/C++ applications). Nowadays, we are witnessing more and\nmore development of Machine Learning-based applications (ML-based\napplications). Today, there are many popular libraries that facilitate and\ncontribute to the development of such applications, among which we can mention:\nPytorch, Tensorflow, Theano, MXNet, Scikit-Learn, Caffe, and Keras. Despite the\npopularity of ML, we don't have a clear understanding of logging practices in\nML applications. In this paper, we aim to fill this knowledge gap and help ML\npractitioners understand the characteristics of logging in ML-based\napplications. In particular, we conduct an empirical study on 110 open-source\nML-based applications. Through a quantitative analysis, we find that logging\npractice in ML-based applications is less pervasive than in traditional\napplications including Android, JAVA, and C/C++ applications. Furthermore, the\nmajority of logging statements in ML-based applications are in info and warn\nlevels, compared to traditional applications where info is the majority of\nlogging statement in C/C++ application and debug, error levels constitute the\nmajority of logging statement in Android application. We also perform a\nquantitative and qualitative analysis of a random sample of logging statements\nto understand where ML developers put most of logging statements and examine\nwhy and how they are using logging. These analyses led to the following\nobservations: (i) ML developers put most of the logging statements in model\ntraining, and in non-ML components. (ii) Data and model management appear to be\nthe main reason behind the introduction of logging statements in ML-based\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation has recently achieved notable advances by exploiting\n\"class-level\" contextual information during learning. However, these approaches\nsimply concatenate class-level information to pixel features to boost the pixel\nrepresentation learning, which cannot fully utilize intra-class and inter-class\ncontextual information. Moreover, these approaches learn soft class centers\nbased on coarse mask prediction, which is prone to error accumulation. To\nbetter exploit class level information, we propose a universal Class-Aware\nRegularization (CAR) approach to optimize the intra-class variance and\ninter-class distance during feature learning, motivated by the fact that humans\ncan recognize an object by itself no matter which other objects it appears\nwith. Moreover, we design a dedicated decoder for CAR (CARD), which consists of\na novel spatial token mixer and an upsampling module, to maximize its gain for\nexisting baselines while being highly efficient in terms of computational cost.\nSpecifically, CAR consists of three novel loss functions. The first loss\nfunction encourages more compact class representations within each class, the\nsecond directly maximizes the distance between different class centers, and the\nthird further pushes the distance between inter-class centers and pixels.\nFurthermore, the class center in our approach is directly generated from ground\ntruth instead of from the error-prone coarse prediction. CAR can be directly\napplied to most existing segmentation models during training, and can largely\nimprove their accuracy at no additional inference overhead. Extensive\nexperiments and ablation studies conducted on multiple benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed CAR can boost the accuracy of all baseline models\nby up to 2.23% mIOU with superior generalization ability. CARD outperforms SOTA\napproaches on multiple benchmarks with a highly efficient architecture.",

To raise\nconcerns about significant potential threats posed by I-IRSs, we propose an\nalternative method to jam legitimate users (LUs) without relying on the CSI.

    "abstract": "As a core task in location-based services (LBS) (e.g., navigation maps),\nquery and point of interest (POI) matching connects users' intent with\nreal-world geographic information. Recently, pre-trained models (PTMs) have\nmade advancements in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Generic\ntext-based PTMs do not have enough geographic knowledge for query-POI matching.\nTo overcome this limitation, related literature attempts to employ\ndomain-adaptive pre-training based on geo-related corpus. However, a query\ngenerally contains mentions of multiple geographic objects, such as nearby\nroads and regions of interest (ROIs). The geographic context (GC), i.e., these\ndiverse geographic objects and their relationships, is therefore pivotal to\nretrieving the most relevant POI. Single-modal PTMs can barely make use of the\nimportant GC and therefore have limited performance. In this work, we propose a\nnovel query-POI matching method Multi-modal Geographic language model (MGeo),\nwhich comprises a geographic encoder and a multi-modal interaction module. MGeo\nrepresents GC as a new modality and is able to fully extract multi-modal\ncorrelations for accurate query-POI matching. Besides, there is no publicly\navailable benchmark for this topic. In order to facilitate further research, we\nbuild a new open-source large-scale benchmark Geographic TExtual Similarity\n(GeoTES). The POIs come from an open-source geographic information system\n(GIS). The queries are manually generated by annotators to prevent privacy\nissues. Compared with several strong baselines, the extensive experiment\nresults and detailed ablation analyses on GeoTES demonstrate that our proposed\nmulti-modal pre-training method can significantly improve the query-POI\nmatching capability of generic PTMs, even when the queries' GC is not provided.\nOur code and dataset are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/PhantomGrapes/MGeo.",

    "abstract": "The suffix trees are fundamental data structures for various kinds of string\nprocessing. The suffix tree of a text string $T$ of length $n$ has $O(n)$ nodes\nand edges, and the string label of each edge is encoded by a pair of positions\nin $T$. Thus, even after the tree is built, the input string $T$ needs to be\nkept stored and random access to $T$ is still needed. The \\emph{linear-size\nsuffix tries} (\\emph{LSTs}), proposed by Crochemore et al. [Linear-size suffix\ntries, TCS 638:171-178, 2016], are a \"stand-alone\" alternative to the suffix\ntrees. Namely, the LST of an input text string $T$ of length $n$ occupies\n$O(n)$ total space, and supports pattern matching and other tasks with the same\nefficiency as the suffix tree without the need to store the input text string\n$T$. Crochemore et al. proposed an \\emph{offline} algorithm which transforms\nthe suffix tree of $T$ into the LST of $T$ in $O(n \\log \\sigma)$ time and\n$O(n)$ space, where $\\sigma$ is the alphabet size. In this paper, we present\ntwo types of \\emph{online} algorithms which \"directly\" construct the LST, from\nright to left, and from left to right, without constructing the suffix tree as\nan intermediate structure. Both algorithms construct the LST incrementally when\na new symbol is read, and do not access the previously read symbols. Both of\nthe right-to-left construction algorithm and the left-to-right construction\nalgorithm work in $O(n \\log \\sigma)$ time and $O(n)$ space.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the notion of age in task-oriented communications that\naims to execute a task at a receiver utilizing the data at its transmitter. The\ntransmitter-receiver operations are modeled as an encoder-decoder pair of deep\nneural networks (DNNs) that are jointly trained while considering channel\neffects. The encoder converts data samples into feature vectors of small\ndimension and transmits them with a small number of channel uses thereby\nreducing the number of transmissions and latency. Instead of reconstructing\ninput samples, the decoder performs a task, e.g., classification, on the\nreceived signals. Applying different DNNs on MNIST and CIFAR-10 image data, the\nclassifier accuracy is shown to increase with the number of channel uses at the\nexpense of longer service time. The peak age of task information (PAoTI) is\nintroduced to analyze this accuracy-latency tradeoff when the age grows unless\na received signal is classified correctly. By incorporating channel and traffic\neffects, design guidelines are obtained for task-oriented communications by\ncharacterizing how the PAoTI first decreases and then increases with the number\nof channels uses. A dynamic update mechanism is presented to adapt the number\nof channel uses to channel and traffic conditions, and reduce the PAoTI in\ntask-oriented communications.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML)-based methods have recently become attractive for\ndetecting security vulnerability exploits. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art ML\nmodels like long short-term memories (LSTMs) and transformers incur significant\ncomputation overheads. This overhead makes it infeasible to deploy them in\nreal-time environments. We propose a novel ML-based exploit detection model,\nML-FEED, that enables highly efficient inference without sacrificing\nperformance. We develop a novel automated technique to extract vulnerability\npatterns from the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures (CVE) databases. This feature enables ML-FEED to be aware of the\nlatest cyber weaknesses. Second, it is not based on the traditional approach of\nclassifying sequences of application programming interface (API) calls into\nexploit categories. Such traditional methods that process entire sequences\nincur huge computational overheads. Instead, ML-FEED operates at a finer\ngranularity and predicts the exploits triggered by every API call of the\nprogram trace. Then, it uses a state table to update the states of these\npotential exploits and track the progress of potential exploit chains. ML-FEED\nalso employs a feature engineering approach that uses natural language\nprocessing-based word embeddings, frequency vectors, and one-hot encoding to\ndetect semantically-similar instruction calls. Then, it updates the states of\nthe predicted exploit categories and triggers an alarm when a vulnerability\nfingerprint executes. Our experiments show that ML-FEED is 72.9x and 75,828.9x\nfaster than state-of-the-art lightweight LSTM and transformer models,\nrespectively. We trained and tested ML-FEED on 79 real-world exploit\ncategories. It predicts categories of exploit in real-time with 98.2%\nprecision, 97.4% recall, and 97.8% F1 score.

    "abstract": "Motion planning is a mature area of research in robotics with many\nwell-established methods based on optimization or sampling the state space,\nsuitable for solving kinematic motion planning. However, when dynamic motions\nunder constraints are needed and computation time is limited, fast kinodynamic\nplanning on the constraint manifold is indispensable. In recent years,\nlearning-based solutions have become alternatives to classical approaches, but\nthey still lack comprehensive handling of complex constraints, such as planning\non a lower-dimensional manifold of the task space while considering the robot's\ndynamics. This paper introduces a novel learning-to-plan framework that\nexploits the concept of constraint manifold, including dynamics, and neural\nplanning methods. Our approach generates plans satisfying an arbitrary set of\nconstraints and computes them in a short constant time, namely the inference\ntime of a neural network. This allows the robot to plan and replan reactively,\nmaking our approach suitable for dynamic environments. We validate our approach\non two simulated tasks and in a demanding real-world scenario, where we use a\nKuka LBR Iiwa 14 robotic arm to perform the hitting movement in robotic Air\nHockey.",

Over the past two decades, OPE has drawn tremendous\nresearch interest from communities of databases, cryptography, and security; we\nhave witnessed significant advances in OPE schemes both theoretically and\nsystematically. All existing OPE schemes assume that the outsourced database is\nmodeled as a single semi-honest adversary who should learn nothing more than\nthe order information of plaintext messages up to a negligible probability.\nThis paper addresses the OPE problem from a new perspective: instead of\nmodeling the outsourced database as a single semi-honest adversary, we assume\nthe outsourced database \\textit{service} compromises a cluster of non-colluding\nservers, which is a practical assumption as all major cloud vendors support\nmultiple database instances deployed to exclusive sub-networks or even to\ndistinct data centers. This assumption allows us to design a new stateless OPE\nprotocol, namely order-preserving database encryption with secret sharing\n(ODES), by employing secret-sharing schemes among those presumably\nnon-colluding servers.

    "abstract": "We propose a learning framework for calibrating predictive models to make\nloss-controlling prediction for exchangeable data, which extends our recently\nproposed conformal loss-controlling prediction for more general cases. By\ncomparison, the predictors built by the proposed loss-controlling approach are\nnot limited to set predictors, and the loss function can be any measurable\nfunction without the monotone assumption. To control the loss values in an\nefficient way, we introduce transformations preserving exchangeability to prove\nfinite-sample controlling guarantee when the test label is obtained, and then\ndevelop an approximation approach to construct predictors. The transformations\ncan be built on any predefined function, which include using optimization\nalgorithms for parameter searching. This approach is a natural extension of\nconformal loss-controlling prediction, since it can be reduced to the latter\nwhen the set predictors have the nesting property and the loss functions are\nmonotone. Our proposed method is tested empirically for high-impact weather\nforecasting and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness for\ncontrolling the non-monotone loss related to false discovery.",

However, the random selection of labeled nodes used by GCNs\nmay lead to unstable generalization performance of GCNs. In this paper, we\npropose an efficient method for the deterministic selection of labeled nodes:\nthe Determinate Node Selection (DNS) algorithm. The DNS algorithm identifies\ntwo categories of representative nodes in the graph: typical nodes and\ndivergent nodes. These labeled nodes are selected by exploring the structure of\nthe graph and determining the ability of the nodes to represent the\ndistribution of data within the graph. The DNS algorithm can be applied quite\nsimply on a wide range of semi-supervised graph neural network models for node\nclassification tasks.

    "abstract": "Developments in cooperative trajectory planning of connected autonomous\nvehicles (CAVs) have gathered considerable momentum and research attention.\nGenerally, such problems present strong non-linearity and non-convexity,\nrendering great difficulties in finding the optimal solution. Existing methods\ntypically suffer from low computational efficiency, and this hinders the\nappropriate applications in large-scale scenarios involving an increasing\nnumber of vehicles. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel decentralized\niterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR) algorithm by leveraging the dual\nconsensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). First, the\noriginal non-convex optimization problem is reformulated into a series of\nconvex optimization problems through iterative neighbourhood approximation.\nThen, the dual of each convex optimization problem is shown to have a consensus\nstructure, which facilitates the use of consensus ADMM to solve for the dual\nsolution in a fully decentralized and parallel architecture. Finally, the\nprimal solution corresponding to the trajectory of each vehicle is recovered by\nsolving a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem iteratively, and a novel\ntrajectory update strategy is proposed to ensure the dynamic feasibility of\nvehicles. With the proposed development, the computation burden is\nsignificantly alleviated such that real-time performance is attainable. Two\ntraffic scenarios are presented to validate the proposed algorithm, and\nthorough comparisons between our proposed method and baseline methods\n(including centralized iLQR, IPOPT, and SQP) are conducted to demonstrate the\nscalability of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Logic locking has been a promising solution to many hardware security\nthreats, such as intellectual property infringement and overproduction. Due to\nthe increased attention that threats have received, many efficient specialized\nattacks against logic locking have been introduced over the years. However, the\nability of an adversary to manipulate a locked netlist prior to mounting an\nattack has not been investigated thoroughly. This paper introduces a\nresynthesis-based strategy that utilizes the strength of a commercial\nelectronic design automation (EDA) tool to reveal the vulnerabilities of a\nlocked circuit. To do so, in a pre-attack step, a locked netlist is\nresynthesized using different synthesis parameters in a systematic way, leading\nto a large number of functionally equivalent but structurally different locked\ncircuits. Then, under the oracle-less threat model, where it is assumed that\nthe adversary only possesses the locked circuit, not the original circuit to\nquery, a prominent attack is applied to these generated netlists collectively,\nfrom which a large number of key bits are deciphered. Nevertheless, this paper\nalso describes how the proposed oracle-less attack can be integrated with an\noracle-guided attack. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated\nfor several benchmarks, including remarkable results for breaking a recently\nproposed provably secure logic locking method and deciphering values of a large\nnumber of key bits of the CSAW'19 circuits with very high accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of a variety of Machine Learning (ML) approaches for travel\nmode choice prediction poses an interesting question to transport modellers:\nwhich models should be used for which applications? The answer to this question\ngoes beyond simple predictive performance, and is instead a balance of many\nfactors, including behavioural interpretability and explainability,\ncomputational complexity, and data efficiency. There is a growing body of\nresearch which attempts to compare the predictive performance of different ML\nclassifiers with classical random utility models. However, existing studies\ntypically analyse only the disaggregate predictive performance, ignoring other\naspects affecting model choice. Furthermore, many studies are affected by\ntechnical limitations, such as the use of inappropriate validation schemes,\nincorrect sampling for hierarchical data, lack of external validation, and the\nexclusive use of discrete metrics. We address these limitations by conducting a\nsystematic comparison of different modelling approaches, across multiple\nmodelling problems, in terms of the key factors likely to affect model choice\n(out-of-sample predictive performance, accuracy of predicted market shares,\nextraction of behavioural indicators, and computational efficiency). We combine\nseveral real world datasets with synthetic datasets, where the data generation\nfunction is known. The results indicate that the models with the highest\ndisaggregate predictive performance (namely extreme gradient boosting and\nrandom forests) provide poorer estimates of behavioural indicators and\naggregate mode shares, and are more expensive to estimate, than other models,\nincluding deep neural networks and Multinomial Logit (MNL).

Recent self-supervised\nlearning methods are dominated by noise-contrastive estimation (NCE, also known\nas contrastive learning), which aims to learn invariant visual representations\nby contrasting one homogeneous image pair with a large number of heterogeneous\nimage pairs in each training step. Nonetheless, NCE-based approaches still\nsuffer from one major problem that is one homogeneous pair is not enough to\nextract robust and invariant semantic information.

In recent years, artificial\nintelligence has shown strong capabilities in improving prediction accuracy.\nHowever, its characteristics of inexplicability and uncertainty make it\nchallenging to determine the traffic environmental effect on prediction\nexplicitly, posing significant challenges to safety-critical decision-making.\nTo address these challenges, this study proposes a trajectory prediction\nframework with the epistemic uncertainty estimation ability that outputs high\nuncertainty when confronting unforeseeable or unknown scenarios. The proposed\nframework is used to analyze the environmental effect on the prediction\nalgorithm performance. In the analysis, the traffic environment is considered\nin terms of scenario features and shifts, respectively, where features are\ndivided into kinematic features of a target agent, features of its surrounding\ntraffic participants, and other features. In addition, feature correlation and\nimportance analyses are performed to study the above features' influence on the\nprediction error and epistemic uncertainty. Further, a cross-dataset case study\nis conducted using multiple intersection datasets to investigate the impact of\nunavoidable distributional shifts in the real world on trajectory prediction.\nThe results indicate that the deep ensemble-based method has advantages in\nimproving prediction robustness and estimating epistemic uncertainty. The\nconsistent conclusions are obtained by the feature correlation and importance\nanalyses, including the conclusion that kinematic features of the target agent\nhave relatively strong effects on the prediction error and epistemic\nuncertainty.

Recent studies have demonstrated,\nhowever, that a large portion of Jupyter notebooks available on public\nplatforms are undocumented and lacks a narrative structure. This reduces the\nreadability of these notebooks. To address this shortcoming, this paper\npresents HeaderGen, a novel tool-based approach that automatically annotates\ncode cells with categorical markdown headers based on a taxonomy of\nmachine-learning operations, and classifies and displays function calls\naccording to this taxonomy. For this functionality to be realized, HeaderGen\nenhances an existing call graph analysis in PyCG. To improve precision,\nHeaderGen extends PyCG's analysis with support for handling external library\ncode and flow-sensitivity. The former is realized by facilitating the\nresolution of function return-types. Furthermore, HeaderGen uses type\ninformation to perform pattern matching on code syntax to annotate code cells.\nThe evaluation on 15 real-world Jupyter notebooks from Kaggle shows that\nHeaderGen's underlying call graph analysis yields high accuracy (96.4%\nprecision and 95.9% recall). This is because HeaderGen can resolve return-types\nof external libraries where existing type inference tools such as pytype (by\nGoogle), pyright (by Microsoft), and Jedi fall short. The header generation has\na precision of 82.2% and a recall rate of 96.8% with regard to headers created\nmanually by experts. In a user study, HeaderGen helps participants finish\ncomprehension and navigation tasks faster. All participants clearly perceive\nHeaderGen as useful to their task.",

    "abstract": "Since data is the fuel that drives machine learning models, and access to\nlabeled data is generally expensive, semi-supervised methods are constantly\npopular. They enable the acquisition of large datasets without the need for too\nmany expert labels. This work combines self-labeling techniques with active\nlearning in a selective sampling scenario. We propose a new method that builds\nan ensemble classifier. Based on an evaluation of the inconsistency of the\ndecisions of the individual base classifiers for a given observation, a\ndecision is made on whether to request a new label or use the self-labeling. In\npreliminary studies, we show that naive application of self-labeling can harm\nperformance by introducing bias towards selected classes and consequently lead\nto skewed class distribution. Hence, we also propose mechanisms to reduce this\nphenomenon. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method matches\ncurrent selective sampling methods or achieves better results.",

Lossy compression can be used to reduce the size of exchanged files\nand associated delays, at the cost of adding noise to model updates. By\njudiciously adapting clients' compression to varying network congestion, an FL\napplication can reduce wall clock training time.

    "abstract": "Entity and relation extraction is a key task in information extraction, where\nthe output can be used for downstream NLP tasks. Existing approaches for entity\nand relation extraction tasks mainly focus on the English corpora and ignore\nother languages. Thus, it is critical to improving performance in a\nmultilingual setting. Meanwhile, multilingual training is usually used to boost\ncross-lingual performance by transferring knowledge from languages (e.g.,\nhigh-resource) to other (e.g., low-resource) languages. However, language\ninterference usually exists in multilingual tasks as the model parameters are\nshared among all languages. In this paper, we propose a two-stage multilingual\ntraining method and a joint model called Multilingual Entity and Relation\nExtraction framework (mERE) to mitigate language interference across languages.\nSpecifically, we randomly concatenate sentences in different languages to train\na Language-universal Aggregator (LA), which narrows the distance of embedding\nrepresentations by obtaining the unified language representation. Then, we\nseparate parameters to mitigate interference via tuning a Language-specific\nSwitcher (LS), which includes several independent sub-modules to refine the\nlanguage-specific feature representation. After that, to enhance the relational\ntriple extraction, the sentence representations concatenated with the relation\nfeature are used to recognize the entities. Extensive experimental results show\nthat our method outperforms both the monolingual and multilingual baseline\nmethods. Besides, we also perform detailed analysis to show that mERE is\nlightweight but effective on relational triple extraction and mERE{} is easy to\ntransfer to other backbone models of multi-field tasks, which further\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of our method.",

Despite the rapid progress, previous works mostly require both\npositive and negative sample pairs for contrastive clustering, which rely on a\nrelative large batch-size. Moreover, they typically adopt a two-stream\narchitecture with two augmented views, which overlook the possibility and\npotential benefits of multi-stream architectures (especially with heterogeneous\nor hybrid networks). In light of this, this paper presents a new end-to-end\ndeep clustering approach termed Heterogeneous Tri-stream Clustering Network\n(HTCN). The tri-stream architecture in HTCN consists of three main components,\nincluding two weight-sharing online networks and a target network, where the\nparameters of the target network are the exponential moving average of that of\nthe online networks. Notably, the two online networks are trained by\nsimultaneously (i) predicting the instance representations of the target\nnetwork and (ii) enforcing the consistency between the cluster representations\nof the target network and that of the two online networks.

The system is well-known as a canonical form for a class of\nsecond-order nonholonomic systems obtained by appropriate transformation of the\ngeneralized coordinates and control inputs. The system is decomposed into three\nsubsystems, two of them are the so-called double integrators and the other\nsubsystem is a nonlinear system depending on one of the double integrators. The\ndouble integrators are linearly controllable, which enables to transit the\nvalue of the position state in order to modify the nature of the nonlinear\nsystem that depends on them. Transiting the value to \"one\" corresponds to\nmodifying the nonlinear subsystem into the double integrator; transiting the\nvalue to \"zero\" corresponds to modifying the nonlinear subsystem into an\nuncontrollable linear autonomous system. Focusing on this nature, this paper\nproposes a feedforward control strategy. Furthermore, from the perspective of\npractical usefulness, the control strategy is extended into trajectory tracking\ncontrol by using proportional-derivative feedback.

Recent approaches mainly focus on\nthe design of view transformation, either pixel-wisely lifting perspective view\nfeatures into 3D space with estimated depth or grid-wisely constructing BEV\nfeatures via 3D projection, treating all pixels or grids equally. However,\nchoosing what to transform is also important but has rarely been discussed\nbefore. The pixels of a moving car are more informative than the pixels of the\nsky. To fully utilize the information contained in images, the view\ntransformation should be able to adapt to different image regions according to\ntheir contents. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named\nFrustumFormer, which pays more attention to the features in instance regions\nvia adaptive instance-aware resampling. Specifically, the model obtains\ninstance frustums on the bird's eye view by leveraging image view object\nproposals. An adaptive occupancy mask within the instance frustum is learned to\nrefine the instance location. Moreover, the temporal frustum intersection could\nfurther reduce the localization uncertainty of objects. Comprehensive\nexperiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of\nFrustumFormer, and we achieve a new state-of-the-art performance on the\nbenchmark. Codes will be released soon.",

    "abstract": "The construction of lightweight High-definition (HD) maps containing\ngeometric and semantic information is of foremost importance for the\nlarge-scale deployment of autonomous driving. To automatically generate such\ntype of map from a set of images captured by a vehicle, most works formulate\nthis mapping as a segmentation problem, which implies heavy post-processing to\nobtain the final vectorized representation. Alternative techniques have the\nability to generate an HD map in an end-to-end manner but rely on\ncomputationally expensive auto-regressive models. To bring camera-based to an\napplicable level, we propose InstaGraM, a fast end-to-end network generating a\nvectorized HD map via instance-level graph modeling of the map elements. Our\nstrategy consists of three main stages: top-view feature extraction, road\nelements' vertices and edges detection, and conversion to a semantic vector\nrepresentation. After top-down feature extraction, an encoder-decoder\narchitecture is utilized to predict a set of vertices and edge maps of the road\nelements. Finally, these vertices along with edge maps are associated through\nan attentional graph neural network generating a semantic vectorized map.\nInstead of relying on a common segmentation approach, we propose to regress\ndistance transform maps as they provide strong spatial relations and\ndirectional information between vertices. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes\ndataset show that our proposed network outperforms HDMapNet by 13.7 mAP and\nachieves comparable accuracy with VectorMapNet 5x faster inference speed.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing amount of available data and advances in computing\ncapabilities, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully employed to\nsolve challenging tasks in various areas, including healthcare, climate, and\nfinance. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art DNNs are susceptible to\nquasi-imperceptible perturbed versions of the original images -- adversarial\nexamples. These perturbations of the network input can lead to disastrous\nimplications in critical areas where wrong decisions can directly affect human\nlives. Adversarial training is the most efficient solution to defend the\nnetwork against these malicious attacks. However, adversarial trained networks\ngenerally come with lower clean accuracy and higher computational complexity.\nThis work proposes a data selection (DS) strategy to be applied in the\nmini-batch training. Based on the cross-entropy loss, the most relevant samples\nin the batch are selected to update the model parameters in the\nbackpropagation. The simulation results show that a good compromise can be\nobtained regarding robustness and standard accuracy, whereas the computational\ncomplexity of the backpropagation pass is reduced.",

This issue frequently brings more difficulty to relevant\nlearning tasks, such as trajectory imputation and prediction. Nowadays, little\nexisting work simultaneously deals with imputation and prediction on human\ntrajectories. This work plans to explore whether the learning process of\nimputation and prediction could benefit from each other to achieve better\noutcomes. And the question will be answered by studying the coexistence\npatterns between missing points and observed ones in incomplete trajectories.\nMore specifically, the proposed model develops an imputation component based on\nthe self-attention mechanism to capture the coexistence patterns between\nobservations and missing points among encoder-decoder layers. Meanwhile, a\nrecurrent unit is integrated to extract the sequential embeddings from newly\nimputed sequences for predicting the following location. Furthermore, a new\nimplementation called Imputation Cycle is introduced to enable gradual\nimputation with prediction enhancement at multiple levels, which helps to\naccelerate the speed of convergence. The experimental results on three\ndifferent real-world mobility datasets show that the proposed approach has\nsignificant advantages over the competitive baselines across both imputation\nand prediction tasks in terms of accuracy and stability.",

Background reconstruction is one of the methods to deal\nwith this problem. This paper proposes an ISTD method based on background\nreconstruction called Dynamic Background Reconstruction (DBR). DBR consists of\nthree modules: a dynamic shift window module (DSW), a background reconstruction\nmodule (BR), and a detection head (DH).

    "title": "Large Scale Qualitative Evaluation of Generative Image Model Outputs",
    "abstract": "Evaluating generative image models remains a difficult problem. This is due\nto the high dimensionality of the outputs, the challenging task of representing\nbut not replicating training data, and the lack of metrics that fully\ncorrespond to human perception and capture all the properties we want these\nmodels to exhibit. Therefore, qualitative evaluation of model outputs is an\nimportant part of model development and research publication practice.\nQuantitative evaluation is currently under-served by existing tools, which do\nnot easily facilitate structured exploration of a large number of examples\nacross the latent space of the model. To address this issue, we present Ravel,\na visual analytics system that enables qualitative evaluation of model outputs\non the order of hundreds of thousands of images. Ravel allows users to discover\nphenomena such as mode collapse, and find areas of training data that the model\nhas failed to capture. It allows users to evaluate both quality and diversity\nof generated images in comparison to real images or to the output of another\nmodel that serves as a baseline. Our paper describes three case studies\ndemonstrating the key insights made possible with Ravel, supported by a domain\nexpert user study.",

    "abstract": "The most common mental disorders experienced by a person in daily life are\ndepression and anxiety. Social stigma makes people with depression and anxiety\nneglected by their surroundings. Therefore, they turn to social media like\nTwitter for support. Detecting users with potential depression and anxiety\ndisorders through textual data is not easy because they do not explicitly\ndiscuss their mental state. It takes a model that can identify potential users\nwho experience depression and anxiety on textual data to get treatment earlier.\nText classification techniques can achieve this. One approach that can be used\nis LSTM as an RNN architecture development in dealing with vanishing gradient\nproblems. Standard LSTM does not capture enough information because it can only\nread sentences from one direction. Meanwhile, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) is a\ntwo-way LSTM that can capture information without ignoring the context and\nmeaning of a sentence. The proposed BiLSTM model is higher than all traditional\nmachine learning models and standard LSTMs. Based on the test results, the\nhighest accuracy obtained by BiLSTM reached 94.12%.

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing popularity of the stance detection task, existing\napproaches are predominantly limited to using the textual content of social\nmedia posts for the classification, overlooking the social nature of the task.\nThe stance detection task becomes particularly challenging in cross-target\nclassification scenarios, where even in few-shot training settings the model\nneeds to predict the stance towards new targets for which the model has only\nseen few relevant samples during training. To address the cross-target stance\ndetection in social media by leveraging the social nature of the task, we\nintroduce CT-TN, a novel model that aggregates multimodal embeddings derived\nfrom both textual and network features of the data. We conduct experiments in a\nfew-shot cross-target scenario on six different combinations of\nsource-destination target pairs. By comparing CT-TN with state-of-the-art\ncross-target stance detection models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmodel by achieving average performance improvements ranging from 11% to 21%\nacross different baseline models. Experiments with different numbers of shots\nshow that CT-TN can outperform other models after seeing 300 instances of the\ndestination target. Further, ablation experiments demonstrate the positive\ncontribution of each of the components of CT-TN towards the final performance.\nWe further analyse the network interactions between social media users, which\nreveal the potential of using social features for cross-target stance\ndetection.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new method that reformulates point cloud\ncompletion as a set-to-set translation problem and design a new model, called\nPoinTr, which adopts a Transformer encoder-decoder architecture for point cloud\ncompletion. By representing the point cloud as a set of unordered groups of\npoints with position embeddings, we convert the input data to a sequence of\npoint proxies and employ the Transformers for generation. To facilitate\nTransformers to better leverage the inductive bias about 3D geometric\nstructures of point clouds, we further devise a geometry-aware block that\nmodels the local geometric relationships explicitly. The migration of\nTransformers enables our model to better learn structural knowledge and\npreserve detailed information for point cloud completion. Taking a step towards\nmore complicated and diverse situations, we further propose AdaPoinTr by\ndeveloping an adaptive query generation mechanism and designing a novel\ndenoising task during completing a point cloud. Coupling these two techniques\nenables us to train the model efficiently and effectively: we reduce training\ntime (by 15x or more) and improve completion performance (over 20%). We also\nshow our method can be extended to the scene-level point cloud completion\nscenario by designing a new geometry-enhanced semantic scene completion\nframework. Extensive experiments on the existing and newly-proposed datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which attains 6.53 CD on PCN, 0.81\nCD on ShapeNet-55 and 0.392 MMD on real-world KITTI, surpassing other work by a\nlarge margin and establishing new state-of-the-arts on various benchmarks.

Our approach consists in adapting Pip to inherit its flexibility\n(multiple levels of isolation) but using the Memory Protection Unit (MPU)\ninstead of the MMU since the MPU is commonly available on constrained embedded\nsystems (typically ARMv7 Cortex-M4 or ARMv8 Cortex-M33 and similar devices).\nThis paper describes our design of Pip-MPU (Pip's variant based on the MPU) and\nthe rationale behind our choices.

We\ndemonstrate that although our prototyped Pip-MPU causes a 16% overhead on both\nperformance and energy consumption, it can reduce the attack surface of the\naccessible application memory from 100% down to 2% and the privileged\noperations by 99%.

The goal of the proposed\ndefence is to reveal whether a Deep Neural Network model is subject to a\nbackdoor attack by inspecting the training dataset. CCA-UD first clusters the\nsamples of the training set by means of density-based clustering. Then, it\napplies a novel strategy to detect the presence of poisoned clusters. The\nproposed strategy is based on a general misclassification behaviour obtained\nwhen the features of a representative example of the analysed cluster are added\nto benign samples. The capability of inducing a misclassification error is a\ngeneral characteristic of poisoned samples, hence the proposed defence is\nattack-agnostic. This mask a significant difference with respect to existing\ndefences, that, either can defend against only some types of backdoor attacks,\ne.g., when the attacker corrupts the label of the poisoned samples, or are\neffective only when some conditions on the poisoning ratios adopted by the\nattacker or the kind of triggering pattern used by the attacker are satisfied.\nExperiments carried out on several classification tasks, considering different\ntypes of backdoor attacks and triggering patterns, including both local and\nglobal triggers, reveal that the proposed method is very effective to defend\nagainst backdoor attacks in all the cases, always outperforming the state of\nthe art techniques.",

    "abstract": "Building 3D reconstruction from remote sensing images has a wide range of\napplications in smart cities, photogrammetry and other fields. Methods for\nautomatic 3D urban building modeling typically employ multi-view images as\ninput to algorithms to recover point clouds and 3D models of buildings.\nHowever, such models rely heavily on multi-view images of buildings, which are\ntime-intensive and limit the applicability and practicality of the models. To\nsolve these issues, we focus on designing an efficient DSM estimation-driven\nreconstruction framework (Building3D), which aims to reconstruct 3D building\nmodels from the input single-view remote sensing image. First, we propose a\nSemantic Flow Field-guided DSM Estimation (SFFDE) network, which utilizes the\nproposed concept of elevation semantic flow to achieve the registration of\nlocal and global features. Specifically, in order to make the network semantics\nglobally aware, we propose an Elevation Semantic Globalization (ESG) module to\nrealize the semantic globalization of instances. Further, in order to alleviate\nthe semantic span of global features and original local features, we propose a\nLocal-to-Global Elevation Semantic Registration (L2G-ESR) module based on\nelevation semantic flow. Our Building3D is rooted in the SFFDE network for\nbuilding elevation prediction, synchronized with a building extraction network\nfor building masks, and then sequentially performs point cloud reconstruction,\nsurface reconstruction (or CityGML model reconstruction). On this basis, our\nBuilding3D can optionally generate CityGML models or surface mesh models of the\nbuildings. Extensive experiments on ISPRS Vaihingen and DFC2019 datasets on the\nDSM estimation task show that our SFFDE significantly improves upon\nstate-of-the-arts. Furthermore, our Building3D achieves impressive results in\nthe 3D point cloud and 3D model reconstruction process.",

    "title": "A Personalized Utterance Style (PUS) based Dialogue Strategy for  Efficient Service Requirement Elicitation",
    "abstract": "With the flourish of services on the Internet, a prerequisite for service\nproviders to precisely deliver services to their customers is to capture user\nrequirements comprehensively, accurately, and efficiently. This is called the\n``Service Requirement Elicitation (SRE)'' task. Considering the amount of\ncustomers is huge, it is an inefficient way for service providers to interact\nwith each user by face-to-face dialog. Therefore, to elicit user requirements\nwith the assistance of virtual intelligent assistants has become a mainstream\nway. Since user requirements generally consist of different levels of details\nand need to be satisfied by services from multiple domains, there is a huge\npotential requirement space for SRE to explore to elicit complete requirements.\nConsidering that traditional dialogue system with static slots cannot be\ndirectly applied to the SRE task, it is a challenge to design an efficient\ndialogue strategy to guide users to express their complete and accurate\nrequirements in such a huge potential requirement space. Based on the\nphenomenon that users tend to express requirements subjectively in a sequential\nmanner, we propose a Personalized Utterance Style (PUS) module to perceive the\npersonalized requirement expression habits, and then apply PUS to an dialogue\nstrategy to efficiently complete the SRE task. Specifically, the dialogue\nstrategy chooses suitable response actions for dynamically updating the\ndialogue state. With the assistance of PUS extracted from dialogue history, the\nsystem can shrink the search scope of potential requirement space. Experiment\nresults show that the dialogue strategy with PUS can elicit more accurate user\nrequirements with fewer dialogue rounds.",

    "abstract": "We focus on the problem of learning without forgetting from multiple tasks\narriving sequentially, where each task is defined using a few-shot episode of\nnovel or already seen classes. We approach this problem using the recently\npublished HyperTransformer (HT), a Transformer-based hypernetwork that\ngenerates a specialized task-specific CNN weights directly from the support\nset. In order to learn from a continual sequence of task, we propose to\nrecursively re-use the generated weights as input to the HT for the next task.\nThis way, the generated CNN weights themselves act as a representation of\npreviously learned tasks, and the HT is trained to update these weights so that\nthe new task can be learned without forgetting past tasks. This approach is\ndifferent from most continual learning algorithms that typically rely on using\nreplay buffers, weight regularization or task-dependent architectural changes.\nWe demonstrate that our proposed Continual HyperTransformer method equipped\nwith a prototypical loss is capable of learning and retaining knowledge about\npast tasks for a variety of scenarios, including learning from mini-batches,\nand task-incremental and class-incremental learning scenarios.",

However, their usage in\nreal-time applications, such as in virtual reality surgical training, is\nlimited by computational cost. In this application scenario, which typically\ninvolves transportable simulators, the computing hardware severely constrains\nthe size or the level of details of the simulated scene. To address this\nlimitation, data-driven approaches have been suggested to simulate mechanical\ndeformations by learning the mapping rules from FEM generated datasets. Herein,\nwe propose a deep learning method for predicting displacement fields of soft\ntissues with viscoelastic properties. The main contribution of this work is the\nuse of a physics-guided loss function for the optimization of the deep learning\nmodel parameters. The proposed deep learning model is based on convolutional\n(CNN) and recurrent layers (LSTM) to predict spatiotemporal variations. It is\naugmented with a mass conservation law in the lost function to prevent the\ngeneration of physically inconsistent results. The deep learning model is\ntrained on a set of FEM datasets that are generated from a commercially\navailable state-of-the-art numerical neurosurgery simulator. The use of the\nphysics-guided loss function in a deep learning model has led to a better\ngeneralization in the prediction of deformations in unseen simulation cases.\nMoreover, the proposed method achieves a better accuracy over the conventional\nCNN models, where improvements were observed in unseen tissue from 8% to 30%\ndepending on the magnitude of external forces.

    "title": "ShadowNav: Crater-Based Localization for Nighttime and Permanently  Shadowed Region Lunar Navigation",
    "abstract": "There has been an increase in interest in missions that drive significantly\nlonger distances per day than what has currently been performed. Further, some\nof these proposed missions require autonomous driving and absolute localization\nin darkness. For example, the Endurance A mission proposes to drive 1200km of\nits total traverse at night. The lack of natural light available during such\nmissions limits what can be used as visual landmarks and the range at which\nlandmarks can be observed. In order for planetary rovers to traverse long\nranges, onboard absolute localization is critical to the ability of the rover\nto maintain its planned trajectory and avoid known hazardous regions.\nCurrently, to accomplish absolute localization, a ground in the loop (GITL)\noperation is performed wherein a human operator matches local maps or images\nfrom onboard with orbital images and maps. This GITL operation limits the\ndistance that can be driven in a day to a few hundred meters, which is the\ndistance that the rover can maintain acceptable localization error via relative\nmethods. Previous work has shown that using craters as landmarks is a promising\napproach for performing absolute localization on the moon during the day. In\nthis work we present a method of absolute localization that utilizes craters as\nlandmarks and matches detected crater edges on the surface with known craters\nin orbital maps. We focus on a localization method based on a perception system\nwhich has an external illuminator and a stereo camera. We evaluate (1) both\nmonocular and stereo based surface crater edge detection techniques, (2)\nmethods of scoring the crater edge matches for optimal localization, and (3)\nlocalization performance on simulated Lunar surface imagery at night. We\ndemonstrate that this technique shows promise for maintaining absolute\nlocalization error of less than 10m required for most planetary rover missions.",

    "abstract": "The enormous amount of data produced by mobile and IoT devices has motivated\nthe development of federated learning (FL), a framework allowing such devices\n(or clients) to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing\ntheir local data. FL algorithms (like FedAvg) iteratively aggregate model\nupdates computed by clients on their own datasets.

This paper presents the first convergence analysis for a FedAvg-like\nFL algorithm under heterogeneous and correlated client availability.

To\nthis purpose, CA-Fed dynamically adapts the weight given to each client and may\nignore clients with low availability and large correlation.

    "abstract": "As the array dimension of massive MIMO systems increases to unprecedented\nlevels, two problems occur. First, the spatial stationarity assumption along\nthe antenna elements is no longer valid. Second, the large array size results\nin an unacceptably high power consumption if high-resolution analog-to-digital\nconverters are used. To address these two challenges, we consider a Bussgang\nlinear minimum mean square error (BLMMSE)-based channel estimator for large\nscale massive MIMO systems with one-bit quantizers and a spatially\nnon-stationary channel. Whereas other works usually assume that the channel\ncovariance is known at the base station, we consider a plug-in BLMMSE estimator\nthat uses an estimate of the channel covariance and rigorously analyze the\ndistortion produced by using an estimated, rather than the true, covariance. To\ncope with the spatial non-stationarity, we introduce dithering into the\nquantized signals and provide a theoretical error analysis. In addition, we\npropose an angular domain fitting procedure which is based on solving an\ninstance of non-negative least squares. For the multi-user data transmission\nphase, we further propose a BLMMSE-based receiver to handle one-bit quantized\ndata signals. Our numerical results show that the performance of the proposed\nBLMMSE channel estimator is very close to the oracle-aided scheme with ideal\nknowledge of the channel covariance matrix. The BLMMSE receiver outperforms the\nconventional maximum-ratio-combining and zero-forcing receivers in terms of the\nresulting ergodic sum rate.",

    "abstract": "Temporal information extraction (TIE) has attracted a great deal of interest\nover the last two decades, leading to the development of a significant number\nof datasets. Despite its benefits, having access to a large volume of corpora\nmakes it difficult when it comes to benchmark TIE systems. On the one hand,\ndifferent datasets have different annotation schemes, thus hindering the\ncomparison between competitors across different corpora. On the other hand, the\nfact that each corpus is commonly disseminated in a different format requires a\nconsiderable engineering effort for a researcher/practitioner to develop\nparsers for all of them. This constraint forces researchers to select a limited\namount of datasets to evaluate their systems which consequently limits the\ncomparability of the systems. Yet another obstacle that hinders the\ncomparability of the TIE systems is the evaluation metric employed. While most\nresearch works adopt traditional metrics such as precision, recall, and $F_1$,\na few others prefer temporal awareness -- a metric tailored to be more\ncomprehensive on the evaluation of temporal systems. Although the reason for\nthe absence of temporal awareness in the evaluation of most systems is not\nclear, one of the factors that certainly weights this decision is the necessity\nto implement the temporal closure algorithm in order to compute temporal\nawareness, which is not straightforward to implement neither is currently\neasily available. All in all, these problems have limited the fair comparison\nbetween approaches and consequently, the development of temporal extraction\nsystems. To mitigate these problems, we have developed tieval, a Python library\nthat provides a concise interface for importing different corpora and\nfacilitates system evaluation.

    "abstract": "Existing semantic segmentation works have been mainly focused on designing\neffective decoders; however, the computational load introduced by the overall\nstructure has long been ignored, which hinders their applications on\nresource-constrained hardwares. In this paper, we propose a head-free\nlightweight architecture specifically for semantic segmentation, named Adaptive\nFrequency Transformer. It adopts a parallel architecture to leverage prototype\nrepresentations as specific learnable local descriptions which replaces the\ndecoder and preserves the rich image semantics on high-resolution features.\nAlthough removing the decoder compresses most of the computation, the accuracy\nof the parallel structure is still limited by low computational resources.\nTherefore, we employ heterogeneous operators (CNN and Vision Transformer) for\npixel embedding and prototype representations to further save computational\ncosts. Moreover, it is very difficult to linearize the complexity of the vision\nTransformer from the perspective of spatial domain. Due to the fact that\nsemantic segmentation is very sensitive to frequency information, we construct\na lightweight prototype learning block with adaptive frequency filter of\ncomplexity $O(n)$ to replace standard self attention with $O(n^{2})$. Extensive\nexperiments on widely adopted datasets demonstrate that our model achieves\nsuperior accuracy while retaining only 3M parameters. On the ADE20K dataset,\nour model achieves 41.8 mIoU and 4.6 GFLOPs, which is 4.4 mIoU higher than\nSegformer, with 45% less GFLOPs.

Our work is inspired by recent\n'geometry-free' approaches where multi-view images are encoded as a (global)\nset-latent representation, which is then used to predict the color for\narbitrary query rays. While this representation yields (coarsely) accurate\nimages corresponding to novel viewpoints, the lack of geometric reasoning\nlimits the quality of these outputs. To overcome this limitation, we propose\n'Geometry-biased Transformers' (GBTs) that incorporate geometric inductive\nbiases in the set-latent representation-based inference to encourage multi-view\ngeometric consistency. We induce the geometric bias by augmenting the\ndot-product attention mechanism to also incorporate 3D distances between rays\nassociated with tokens as a learnable bias. We find that this, along with\ncamera-aware embeddings as input, allows our models to generate significantly\nmore accurate outputs. We validate our approach on the real-world CO3D dataset,\nwhere we train our system over 10 categories and evaluate its view-synthesis\nability for novel objects as well as unseen categories.

    "abstract": "Identifying whether a given sample is an outlier or not is an important issue\nin various real-world domains. This study aims to solve the unsupervised\noutlier detection problem where training data contain outliers, but any label\ninformation about inliers and outliers is not given. We propose a powerful and\nefficient learning framework to identify outliers in a training data set using\ndeep neural networks. We start with a new observation called the\ninlier-memorization (IM) effect. When we train a deep generative model with\ndata contaminated with outliers, the model first memorizes inliers before\noutliers. Exploiting this finding, we develop a new method called the outlier\ndetection via the IM effect (ODIM). The ODIM only requires a few updates; thus,\nit is computationally efficient, tens of times faster than other\ndeep-learning-based algorithms. Also, the ODIM filters out outliers\nsuccessfully, regardless of the types of data, such as tabular, image, and\nsequential. We empirically demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of the\nODIM by analyzing 20 data sets.",

    "abstract": "This work presents the model of an ejecta cloud distribution to characterise\nthe plume generated by the impact of a projectile onto asteroids surfaces. A\ncontinuum distribution based on the combination of probability density\nfunctions is developed to describe the size, ejection speed, and ejection\nangles of the fragments. The ejecta distribution is used to statistically\nanalyse the fate of the ejecta. By combining the ejecta distribution with a\nspace-filling sampling technique, we draw samples from the distribution and\nassigned them a number of \\emph{representative fragments} so that the evolution\nin time of a single sample is representative of an ensemble of fragments. Using\nthis methodology, we analyse the fate of the ejecta as a function of different\nmodelling techniques and assumptions. We evaluate the effect of different types\nof distributions, ejection speed models, coefficients, etc. The results show\nthat some modelling assumptions are more influential than others and, in some\ncases, they influence different aspects of the ejecta evolution such as the\nshare of impacting and escaping fragments or the distribution of impacting\nfragments on the asteroid surface.",

    "abstract": "The method of direct imaging has detected many exoplanets and made important\ncontribution to the field of planet formation. The standard method employs\nangular differential imaging (ADI) technique, and more ADI image frames could\nlead to the results with larger signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). However, it would\nneed precious observational time from large telescopes, which are always\nover-subscribed. We thus explore the possibility to generate a converter which\ncan increase the SNR derived from a smaller number of ADI frames. The machine\nlearning technique with two-dimension convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) is\ntested here. Several 2D-CNN models are trained and their performances of\ndenoising are presented and compared. It is found that our proposed Modified\nfive-layer Wide Inference Network with the Residual learning technique and\nBatch normalization (MWIN5-RB) can give the best result. We conclude that this\nMWIN5-RB can be employed as a converter for future observational data.",

    "abstract": "In the absence of persistency of excitation (PE), referring to adaptive\ncontrol systems as \"asymptotically stable\" typically indicates insufficient\nunderstanding of stability concepts. While the state is indeed regulated to\nzero and the parameter estimate has some limit, namely, the overall state\nconverges to some equilibrium, the equilibrium reached is not unique (and not\neven necessarily stable) but is dependent on the initial condition. The\nequilibrium set in the absence of PE is not uniformly attractive (from an open\nset containing the equilibrium set); hence, asymptotic stability does not hold\nand KL estimates are unavailable for the full state. In this paper we pursue\nadaptive control design with KL guarantees on the regulated state, something\nthat is possible but previously unachieved with smooth, time-invariant and\nnon-hybrid adaptive controllers. This property is referred to as Uniform Global\nAsymptotic Output Stability, where the regulated state is thought of as a\nsystem output. We provide designs for (i) systems with a matched uncertainty\nand (ii) systems in the parametric strict feedback form. To guarantee KL\nestimates in the absence of PE, our designs employ time-invariant nonlinear\ndamping terms, which depend both on the state and the parameter estimate. With\nan example, we illustrate the theory.",

Wyner's seminal result showed that\nasymptotically the rate of uniform shared randomness needed for this task is\ngiven by a mutual information induced measure, now referred to as Wyner's\ncommon information. This asymptotic result was extended by Hayashi in the\nquantum setting to separable states, the largest class of states for which this\ntask can be performed. In this work we characterize this task in the one-shot\nsetting using the smooth entropy framework. We do this by introducing one-shot\noperational quantities and correlation measures that characterize them. We\nestablish asymptotic equipartition properties for our correlation measures\nthereby recovering, and in fact strengthening, the aforementioned asymptotic\nresults. In doing so, we consider technical points in one-shot network\ninformation theory and generalize the support lemma to the classical-quantum\nsetting.

Relating the centripetal acceleration due to\nbaryons, $g_\\text{bar}$, to the total dynamical acceleration, $g_\\text{obs}$,\nthe RAR has been claimed to manifest a new law of nature due to its regularity\nand tightness, in agreement with Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). Fits to\nthis relation have been restricted by prior expectations to particular\nfunctional forms, while ESR affords an exhaustive and nearly prior-free search\nthrough functional parameter space to identify the equations optimally trading\naccuracy with simplicity. Working with the SPARC data, we find the best\nfunctions typically satisfy $g_\\text{obs} \\propto g_\\text{bar}$ at high\n$g_\\text{bar}$, although the coefficient of proportionality is not clearly\nunity and the deep-MOND limit $g_\\text{obs} \\propto \\sqrt{g_\\text{bar}}$ as\n$g_\\text{bar} \\to 0$ is little evident at all. By generating mock data\naccording to MOND with or without the external field effect, we find that\nsymbolic regression would not be expected to identify the generating function\nor reconstruct successfully the asymptotic slopes.

The proposed scheme benefits from the strengths\nof the three algorithms while avoiding most of the drawbacks of the individual\nmethods.

In practice we achieve this by using an iterative clustering\napproach and a tunable root-mean-square-deviation-based criterion in the final\ncluster assignment. This allows to find clusters of different densities as well\nas different degrees of structural identity. With the help of four test systems\nwe illustrate the capability and performance of this clustering workflow:\nwild-type and thermostable mutant of the Trp-cage protein (TC5b and TC10b),\nNTL9 and Protein B.

    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) has served as a powerful tool for designing materials\nwith reduced reliance on laboratory testing. However, the use of MD directly to\ntreat the deformation and failure of materials at the mesoscale is still\nlargely beyond reach. Herein, we propose a learning framework to extract a\nperidynamic model as a mesoscale continuum surrogate from MD simulated material\nfracture datasets. Firstly, we develop a novel coarse-graining method, to\nautomatically handle the material fracture and its corresponding\ndiscontinuities in MD displacement dataset. Inspired by the Weighted\nEssentially Non-Oscillatory scheme, the key idea lies at an adaptive procedure\nto automatically choose the locally smoothest stencil, then reconstruct the\ncoarse-grained material displacement field as piecewise smooth solutions\ncontaining discontinuities. Then, based on the coarse-grained MD data, a\ntwo-phase optimization-based learning approach is proposed to infer the optimal\nperidynamics model with damage criterion. In the first phase, we identify the\noptimal nonlocal kernel function from datasets without material damage, to\ncapture the material stiffness properties. Then, in the second phase, the\nmaterial damage criterion is learnt as a smoothed step function from the data\nwith fractures. As a result, a peridynamics surrogate is obtained. Our\nperidynamics surrogate model can be employed in further prediction tasks with\ndifferent grid resolutions from training, and hence allows for substantial\nreductions in computational cost compared with MD. We illustrate the efficacy\nof the proposed approach with several numerical tests for single layer\ngraphene. Our tests show that the proposed data-driven model is robust and\ngeneralizable: it is capable in modeling the initialization and growth of\nfractures under discretization and loading settings that are different from the\nones used during training.",

We utilise a Fokker-Planck approach\nto construct stochastic differential equations that describe market activities,\ncontrol, and noise acting on power-grid dynamics. Using the obtained parameters\nwe create synthetic time series of the frequency dynamics. Our main\ncontribution is to propose two extensions of stochastic power-grid frequency\nmodels and showcase the applicability of these new models to non-Gaussian\nstatistics, as encountered in islands.",

Moreover, it is shown that all\ndifferential inequalities that hold for the fluid model are preserved by the\nparticle method: mass is conserved, mechanical energy is decaying, and a\nmodified mechanical energy functional is also decaying. The proposed particle\nmethod can be used both as a numerical method and as a method of proving\nexistence of solutions for compressible fluid models.",

    "abstract": "This work focuses on modelling a speaker's accent that does not have a\ndedicated text-to-speech (TTS) frontend, including a grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P)\nmodule. Prior work on modelling accents assumes a phonetic transcription is\navailable for the target accent, which might not be the case for low-resource,\nregional accents. In our work, we propose an approach whereby we first augment\nthe target accent data to sound like the donor voice via voice conversion, then\ntrain a multi-speaker multi-accent TTS model on the combination of recordings\nand synthetic data, to generate the donor's voice speaking in the target\naccent. Throughout the procedure, we use a TTS frontend developed for the same\nlanguage but a different accent. We show qualitative and quantitative analysis\nwhere the proposed strategy achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other\ngenerative models. Our work demonstrates that low resource accents can be\nmodelled with relatively little data and without developing an accent-specific\nTTS frontend. Audio samples of our model converting to multiple accents are\navailable on our web page.",

    "abstract": "We study the performance of a cloud-based GPU-accelerated inference server to\nspeed up event reconstruction in neutrino data batch jobs. Using detector data\nfrom the ProtoDUNE experiment and employing the standard DUNE grid job\nsubmission tools, we attempt to reprocess the data by running several thousand\nconcurrent grid jobs, a rate we expect to be typical of current and future\nneutrino physics experiments. We process most of the dataset with the GPU\nversion of our processing algorithm and the remainder with the CPU version for\ntiming comparisons. We find that a 100-GPU cloud-based server is able to easily\nmeet the processing demand, and that using the GPU version of the event\nprocessing algorithm is two times faster than processing these data with the\nCPU version when comparing to the newest CPUs in our sample. The amount of data\ntransferred to the inference server during the GPU runs can overwhelm even the\nhighest-bandwidth network switches, however, unless care is taken to observe\nnetwork facility limits or otherwise distribute the jobs to multiple sites. We\ndiscuss the lessons learned from this processing campaign and several avenues\nfor future improvements.",

    "title": "Dynamics of a data-driven low-dimensional model of turbulent minimal  Couette flow",
    "abstract": "Because the Navier-Stokes equations are dissipative, the long-time dynamics\nof a flow in state space are expected to collapse onto a manifold whose\ndimension may be much lower than the dimension required for a resolved\nsimulation. On this manifold, the state of the system can be exactly described\nin a coordinate system parameterizing the manifold. Describing the system in\nthis low-dimensional coordinate system allows for much faster simulations and\nanalysis. We show, for turbulent Couette flow, that this description of the\ndynamics is possible using a data-driven manifold dynamics modeling method.\nThis approach consists of an autoencoder to find a low-dimensional manifold\ncoordinate system and a set of ordinary differential equations defined by a\nneural network. Specifically, we apply this method to minimal flow unit\nturbulent plane Couette flow at $\\textit{Re}=400$, where a fully resolved\nsolutions requires $\\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ degrees of freedom. Using only data from\nthis simulation we build models with fewer than $20$ degrees of freedom that\nquantitatively capture key characteristics of the flow, including the streak\nbreakdown and regeneration cycle. At short-times, the models track the true\ntrajectory for multiple Lyapunov times, and, at long-times, the models capture\nthe Reynolds stress and the energy balance. For comparison, we show that the\nmodels outperform POD-Galerkin models with $\\sim$2000 degrees of freedom.\nFinally, we compute unstable periodic orbits from the models. Many of these\nclosely resemble previously computed orbits for the full system; additionally,\nwe find nine orbits that correspond to previously unknown solutions in the full\nsystem.",
