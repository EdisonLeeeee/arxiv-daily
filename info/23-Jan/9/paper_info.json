    "abstract": "A new approach is introduced to classify faults in rotating machinery based\non the total energy signature estimated from sensor measurements. The overall\ngoal is to go beyond using black-box models and incorporate additional physical\nconstraints that govern the behavior of mechanical systems. Observational data\nis used to train Hamiltonian neural networks that describe the conserved energy\nof the system for normal and various abnormal regimes. The estimated total\nenergy function, in the form of the weights of the Hamiltonian neural network,\nserves as the new feature vector to discriminate between the faults using\noff-the-shelf classification models. The experimental results are obtained\nusing the MaFaulDa database, where the proposed model yields a promising area\nunder the curve (AUC) of $0.78$ for the binary classification (normal vs\nabnormal) and $0.84$ for the multi-class problem (normal, and $5$ different\nabnormal regimes).",

    "abstract": "This paper explores deep latent variable models for semi-supervised\nparaphrase generation, where the missing target pair is modelled as a latent\nparaphrase sequence. We present a novel unsupervised model named variational\nsequence auto-encoding reconstruction (VSAR), which performs latent sequence\ninference given an observed text. To leverage information from text pairs, we\nintroduce a supervised model named dual directional learning (DDL). Combining\nVSAR with DDL (DDL+VSAR) enables us to conduct semi-supervised learning;\nhowever, the combined model suffers from a cold-start problem. To combat this\nissue, we propose to deal with better weight initialisation, leading to a\ntwo-stage training scheme named knowledge reinforced training. Our empirical\nevaluations suggest that the combined model yields competitive performance\nagainst the state-of-the-art supervised baselines on complete data.\nFurthermore, in scenarios where only a fraction of the labelled pairs are\navailable, our combined model consistently outperforms the strong supervised\nmodel baseline (DDL and Transformer) by a significant margin.",

First, we propose a straightforward filtering strategy titled\nComplexity, Action, and Text-spotting (CAT) that significantly reduces dataset\nsize, while achieving improved performance across zero-shot vision-language\ntasks. Next, we propose an approach titled Concept Distillation to leverage\nstrong unimodal representations for contrastive training that does not increase\ntraining complexity while outperforming prior work.

    "abstract": "The central question in the game theory of cake-cutting is how to distribute\na finite resource among players in a fair way. Most research has focused on how\nto do this for a heterogeneous cake in a situation where the players do not\nhave access to each other's valuation function, but I argue that even sharing\nhomogeneous cake can have interesting mechanism design. Here, I introduce a new\ngame, based on the compositional structure of iterated cake-cutting, that in\nthe case of a homogeneous cake has a Nash equilibrium where each of $n$ players\ngets $1/n$ of the cake. Furthermore, the equilibrium distribution is the result\nof just $n-1$ cuts, so each player gets a contiguous piece of cake. Naive\ncomposition of the `I cut you choose' rule leads to an exponentially unfair\ncake distribution so suffers from a high price of anarchy. This cost is\ncompletely eliminated by the BigPlayer rule. After introducing the game and\nproving the fairness of the equilibrium, the game is implemented in Haskell and\nthe Open Game engine to make the compositional structure explicit.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are a state-of-the-art technology, capable of\noutstanding performance in many key tasks. However, it is challenging to\nintegrate DNNs into safety-critical systems, such as those in the aerospace or\nautomotive domains, due to the risk of adversarial inputs: slightly perturbed\ninputs that can cause the DNN to make grievous mistakes. Adversarial inputs\nhave been shown to plague even modern DNNs; and so the risks they pose must be\nmeasured and mitigated to allow the safe deployment of DNNs in safety-critical\nsystems. Here, we present a novel and scalable tool called gRoMA, which uses a\nstatistical approach for formally measuring the global categorial robustness of\na DNN - i.e., the probability of randomly encountering an adversarial input for\na specific output category. Our tool operates on pre-trained, black-box\nclassification DNNs. It randomly generates input samples that belong to an\noutput category of interest, measures the DNN's susceptibility to adversarial\ninputs around these inputs, and then aggregates the results to infer the\noverall global robustness of the DNN up to some small bounded error. For\nevaluation purposes, we used gRoMA to measure the global robustness of the\nwidespread Densenet DNN model over the CIFAR10 dataset and our results exposed\nsignificant gaps in the robustness of the different output categories. This\nexperiment demonstrates the scalability of the new approach and showcases its\npotential for allowing DNNs to be deployed within critical systems of interest.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we propose a novel adaptive control architecture, which\nprovides dramatically better transient response performance compared to\nconventional adaptive control methods. What makes this architecture unique is\nthe synergistic employment of a traditional, Adaptive Neural Network (ANN)\ncontroller and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. LSTM structures, unlike\nthe standard feed-forward neural networks, can take advantage of the\ndependencies in an input sequence, which can contain critical information that\ncan help predict uncertainty. Through a novel training method we introduced,\nthe LSTM network learns to compensate for the deficiencies of the ANN\ncontroller during sudden changes in plant dynamics. This substantially improves\nthe transient response of the system and allows the controller to quickly react\nto unexpected events. Through careful simulation studies, we demonstrate that\nthis architecture can improve the estimation accuracy on a diverse set of\nuncertainties for an indefinite time span. We also provide an analysis of the\ncontributions of the ANN controller and LSTM network to the control input,\nidentifying their individual roles in compensating low and high-frequency error\ndynamics. This analysis provides insight into why and how the LSTM augmentation\nimproves the system's transient response. The stability of the overall system\nis also shown via a rigorous Lyapunov analysis.",

Despite their importance, a formal framework that\nsupports both these forms of reasoning has, until now, been lacking. We offer a\nsolution in the form of (structural) causal games, which can be seen as\nextending Pearl's causal hierarchy to the game-theoretic domain, or as\nextending Koller and Milch's multi-agent influence diagrams to the causal\ndomain. We then consider three key questions: i) How can the (causal)\ndependencies in games - either between variables, or between strategies - be\nmodelled in a uniform, principled manner? ii) How may causal queries be\ncomputed in causal games, and what assumptions does this require? iii) How do\ncausal games compare to existing formalisms? To address question i), we\nintroduce mechanised games, which encode dependencies between agents' decision\nrules and the distributions governing the game. In response to question ii), we\npresent definitions of predictions, interventions, and counterfactuals, and\ndiscuss the assumptions required for each. Regarding question iii), we describe\ncorrespondences between causal games and other formalisms, and explain how\ncausal games can be used to answer queries that other causal or game-theoretic\nmodels do not support.

Here we present an incentivized experiment to test for\naltruistic behavior among AI agents consisting of large language models\ndeveloped by the private company OpenAI. Using real incentives for AI agents\nthat take the form of tokens used to purchase their services, we first examine\nwhether AI agents maximize their payoffs in a non-social decision task in which\nthey select their payoff from a given range. We then place AI agents in a\nseries of dictator games in which they can share resources with a\nrecipient--either another AI agent, the human experimenter, or an anonymous\ncharity, depending on the experimental condition. Here we find that only the\nmost-sophisticated AI agent in the study maximizes its payoffs more often than\nnot in the non-social decision task (it does so in 92% of all trials), and this\nAI agent also exhibits the most-generous altruistic behavior in the dictator\ngame, resembling humans' rates of sharing with other humans in the game. The\nagent's altruistic behaviors, moreover, vary by recipient: the AI agent shared\nsubstantially less of the endowment with the human experimenter or an anonymous\ncharity than with other AI agents. Our findings provide evidence of behavior\nconsistent with self-interest and altruism in an AI agent.

    "abstract": "Understanding the properties of time-indexed multivariate data has been a\npredominant topic mainly to address open issues in multivariate time series\nanalysis. Usually, the methodologies used to analyze multivariate time series\nare based on adapting approaches for univariate settings or on assumptions and\nparameters for specific problems. A different strategy uses complex network to\nobtain an additional and reduced representation of temporal and causal\nproperties of the time series data. Recent strategies involve mapping\nmultivariate time series into high-level network structures, specifically into\nmultiplex networks representing interconnections between contemporary\ntimestamps of different time series components. In this work, we propose a new\nmapping method that takes advantage of the entire structure of multilayer\nnetworks. We introduce the multilayer horizontal visibility graph that is based\non the new concept of cross-horizontal visibility between lagged timestamps of\ndifferent components, which allows describing the cross-dimension dependencies\nvia inter-layer edges. We use a set of existing topological measures of\nmultilayer networks as well as a novel measure to evaluate and validate our\napproach, which is parameter-free, does not require data pre-processing and is\napplicable to any kind of multivariate time series data. We provide an\nextensive experimental evaluation, where we explore the proposed topological\nmeasures, showing that the inter-layer edges based on cross-horizontal\nvisibility preserve more information about the time series data after the\nmappings, information that would inevitably be lost using mapping methods that\nresult in single-layer and multiplex structures. We also verify that the\ninformation mapped by the inter-layer edges is not enough on its own, but that\nit complements the data information captured by the commonly used intra-layer\nedges.",

    "abstract": "With tools like GitHub Copilot, automatic code suggestion is no longer a\ndream in software engineering. These tools, based on large language models, are\ntypically trained on massive corpora of code mined from unvetted public\nsources. As a result, these models are susceptible to data poisoning attacks\nwhere an adversary manipulates the model's training or fine-tuning phases by\ninjecting malicious data. Poisoning attacks could be designed to influence the\nmodel's suggestions at run time for chosen contexts, such as inducing the model\ninto suggesting insecure code payloads. To achieve this, prior poisoning\nattacks explicitly inject the insecure code payload into the training data,\nmaking the poisoning data detectable by static analysis tools that can remove\nsuch malicious data from the training set. In this work, we demonstrate two\nnovel data poisoning attacks, COVERT and TROJANPUZZLE, that can bypass static\nanalysis by planting malicious poisoning data in out-of-context regions such as\ndocstrings. Our most novel attack, TROJANPUZZLE, goes one step further in\ngenerating less suspicious poisoning data by never including certain\n(suspicious) parts of the payload in the poisoned data, while still inducing a\nmodel that suggests the entire payload when completing code (i.e., outside\ndocstrings). This makes TROJANPUZZLE robust against signature-based\ndataset-cleansing methods that identify and filter out suspicious sequences\nfrom the training data.

    "abstract": "Industrial robots are increasingly deployed in applications requiring an end\neffector tool to closely track a specified path, such as in spraying and\nwelding. Performance and productivity present possibly conflicting objectives:\ntracking accuracy, path speed, and motion uniformity. Industrial robots are\nprogrammed through motion primitives consisting of waypoints connected by\npre-defined motion segments, with specified parameters such as path speed and\nblending zone. The actual executed robot motion depends on the robot joint\nservo controller and joint motion constraints (velocity, acceleration, etc.)\nwhich are largely unknown to the users. Programming a robot to achieve the\ndesired performance today is time-consuming and mostly manual, requiring tuning\na large number of coupled parameters in the motion primitives. The performance\nalso depends on the choice of additional parameters: possible redundant degrees\nof freedom, location of the target curve, and the robot configuration. This\npaper presents a systematic approach to optimize the robot motion primitives\nfor performance. The approach first selects the static parameters, then the\nmotion primitives, and finally iteratively update the waypoints to minimize the\ntracking error. The ultimate performance objective is to maximize the path\nspeed subject to the tracking accuracy and speed uniformity constraints over\nthe entire path. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach in\nsimulation for ABB and FANUC robots for two challenging example curves, and\nexperimentally for an ABB robot.

    "abstract": "Dense matrix multiply (MM) serves as one of the most heavily used kernels in\ndeep learning applications. To cope with the high computation demands of these\napplications, heterogeneous architectures featuring both FPGA and dedicated\nASIC accelerators have emerged as promising platforms. For example, the\nAMD/Xilinx Versal ACAP architecture combines general-purpose CPU cores and\nprogrammable logic with AI Engine processors optimized for AI/ML. With 400\nAIEs, it provides up to 6.4 TFLOPs performance for 32-bit floating-point data.\nHowever, machine learning models often contain both large and small MM\noperations. While large MM operations can be parallelized efficiently across\nmany cores, small MM operations typically cannot. We observe that executing\nsome small MM layers from the BERT natural language processing model on a\nlarge, monolithic MM accelerator in Versal ACAP achieved less than 5% of the\ntheoretical peak performance. Therefore, one key question arises: How can we\ndesign accelerators to fully use the abundant computation resources under\nlimited communication bandwidth for applications with multiple MM layers of\ndiverse sizes? We identify the biggest system throughput bottleneck resulting\nfrom the mismatch of massive computation resources of one monolithic\naccelerator and the various MM layers of small sizes in the application. To\nresolve this problem, we propose the CHARM framework to compose multiple\ndiverse MM accelerator architectures working concurrently towards different\nlayers in one application. We deploy the CHARM framework for four different\napplications, including BERT, ViT, NCF, MLP, on the AMD Versal ACAP VCK190\nevaluation board. Our experiments show that we achieve 1.46 TFLOPs, 1.61\nTFLOPs, 1.74 TFLOPs, and 2.94 TFLOPs inference throughput for BERT, ViT, NCF\nand MLP, which obtain 5.40x, 32.51x, 1.00x and 1.00x throughput gains compared\nto one monolithic accelerator.",

    "title": "Object as Query: Equipping Any 2D Object Detector with 3D Detection  Ability",
    "abstract": "3D object detection from multi-view images has drawn much attention over the\npast few years. Existing methods mainly establish 3D representations from\nmulti-view images and adopt a dense detection head for object detection, or\nemploy object queries distributed in 3D space to localize objects. In this\npaper, we design Multi-View 2D Objects guided 3D Object Detector (MV2D), which\ncan be equipped with any 2D object detector to promote multi-view 3D object\ndetection. Since 2D detections can provide valuable priors for object\nexistence, MV2D exploits 2D detector to generate object queries conditioned on\nthe rich image semantics. These dynamically generated queries enable MV2D to\ndetect objects in larger 3D space without increased computational costs and\nshows a strong capability of localizing 3D objects. For the generated queries,\nwe design a sparse cross attention module to force them to focus on the\nfeatures of specific objects, which reduces the computational cost and\nsuppresses interference from noises. The evaluation results on the nuScenes\ndataset demonstrate that dynamic object queries and sparse feature aggregation\ndo not harm 3D detection capability. MV2D also exhibits a state-of-the-art\nperformance among existing methods. We hope MV2D can serve as a new baseline\nfor future research.",

    "abstract": "Social contagion is a ubiquitous and fundamental process that drives social\nchanges. Although social contagion arises as a result of cognitive processes\nand biases, the integration of cognitive mechanisms with the theory of social\ncontagion remains as an open challenge. In particular, studies on social\nphenomena usually assume contagion dynamics to be either simple or complex,\nrather than allowing it to emerge from cognitive mechanisms, despite empirical\nevidence indicating that a social system can exhibit a spectrum of contagion\ndynamics -- from simple to complex -- simultaneously. Here, we propose a model\nof interacting beliefs as a unifying framework, from which both simple and\ncomplex contagion dynamics can organically arise. Our model also elucidates how\na fundamental mechanism of complex contagion -- resistance -- can come about\nfrom cognitive mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D lane detection is a challenging task due to its lack of depth\ninformation. A popular solution to 3D lane detection is to first transform the\nfront-viewed (FV) images or features into the bird-eye-view (BEV) space with\ninverse perspective mapping (IPM) and detect lanes from BEV features. However,\nthe reliance of IPM on flat ground assumption and loss of context information\nmakes it inaccurate to restore 3D information from BEV representations. An\nattempt has been made to get rid of BEV and predict 3D lanes from FV\nrepresentations directly, while it still underperforms other BEV-based methods\ngiven its lack of structured representation for 3D lanes. In this paper, we\ndefine 3D lane anchors in the 3D space and propose a BEV-free method named\nAnchor3DLane to predict 3D lanes directly from FV representations. 3D lane\nanchors are projected to the FV features to extract their features which\ncontain both good structural and context information to make accurate\npredictions. We further extend Anchor3DLane to the multi-frame setting to\nincorporate temporal information for performance improvement. In addition, we\nalso develop a global optimization method that makes use of the equal-width\nproperty between lanes to reduce the lateral error of predictions. Extensive\nexperiments on three popular 3D lane detection benchmarks show that our\nAnchor3DLane outperforms previous BEV-based methods and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performances.",

    "abstract": "The deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm works brilliantly on solving\nvarious complex control tasks. This phenomenal success can be partly attributed\nto DRL encouraging intelligent agents to sufficiently explore the environment\nand collect diverse experiences during the agent training process. Therefore,\nexploration plays a significant role in accessing an optimal policy for DRL.\nDespite recent works making great progress in continuous control tasks,\nexploration in these tasks has remained insufficiently investigated. To\nexplicitly encourage exploration in continuous control tasks, we propose CCEP\n(Centralized Cooperative Exploration Policy), which utilizes underestimation\nand overestimation of value functions to maintain the capacity of exploration.\nCCEP first keeps two value functions initialized with different parameters, and\ngenerates diverse policies with multiple exploration styles from a pair of\nvalue functions. In addition, a centralized policy framework ensures that CCEP\nachieves message delivery between multiple policies, furthermore contributing\nto exploring the environment cooperatively. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that CCEP achieves higher exploration capacity. Empirical analysis\nshows diverse exploration styles in the learned policies by CCEP, reaping\nbenefits in more exploration regions. And this exploration capacity of CCEP\nensures it outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods across multiple\ncontinuous control tasks shown in experiments.",

    "abstract": "This study takes advantage of recent advances in machine learning to\nestablish a physics-based data analytic platform for distributed reconstruction\nof mechanical properties in layered components from full waveform data. In this\nvein, two logics, namely the direct inversion and physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs), are explored. The direct inversion entails three steps: (i)\nspectral denoising and differentiation of the full-field data, (ii) building\nappropriate neural maps to approximate the profile of unknown physical and\nregularization parameters on their respective domains, and (iii) simultaneous\ntraining of the neural networks by minimizing the Tikhonov-regularized PDE loss\nusing data from (i). PINNs furnish efficient surrogate models of complex\nsystems with predictive capabilities via multitask learning where the field\nvariables are modeled by neural maps endowed with (scaler or distributed)\nauxiliary parameters such as physical unknowns and loss function weights. PINNs\nare then trained by minimizing a measure of data misfit subject to the\nunderlying physical laws as constraints. In this study, to facilitate learning\nfrom ultrasonic data, the PINNs loss adopts (a) wavenumber-dependent Sobolev\nnorms to compute the data misfit, and (b) non-adaptive weights in a specific\nscaling framework to naturally balance the loss objectives by leveraging the\nform of PDEs germane to elastic-wave propagation. Both paradigms are examined\nvia synthetic and laboratory test data. In the latter case, the reconstructions\nare performed at multiple frequencies and the results are verified by a set of\ncomplementary experiments highlighting the importance of verification and\nvalidation in data-driven modeling.",

Existing works typically formulate the\ncross-modal mapping into a regression task, which suffers from the\nregression-to-mean problem leading to over-smoothed facial motions. In this\npaper, we propose to cast speech-driven facial animation as a code query task\nin a finite proxy space of the learned codebook, which effectively promotes the\nvividness of the generated motions by reducing the cross-modal mapping\nuncertainty. The codebook is learned by self-reconstruction over real facial\nmotions and thus embedded with realistic facial motion priors. Over the\ndiscrete motion space, a temporal autoregressive model is employed to\nsequentially synthesize facial motions from the input speech signal, which\nguarantees lip-sync as well as plausible facial expressions.

    "abstract": "Embodied AI is an inevitable trend that emphasizes the interaction between\nintelligent entities and the real world, with broad applications in Robotics,\nespecially target-driven navigation. This task requires the robot to find an\nobject of a certain category efficiently in an unknown domestic environment.\nRecent works focus on exploiting layout relationships by graph neural networks\n(GNNs). However, most of them obtain robot actions directly from observations\nin an end-to-end manner via an incomplete relation graph, which is not\ninterpretable and reliable. We decouple this task and propose ReVoLT, a\nhierarchical framework: (a) an object detection visual front-end, (b) a\nhigh-level reasoner (infers semantic sub-goals), (c) an intermediate-level\nplanner (computes geometrical positions), and (d) a low-level controller\n(executes actions). ReVoLT operates with a multi-layer semantic-spatial\ntopological graph. The reasoner uses multiform structured relations as priors,\nwhich are obtained from combinatorial relation extraction networks composed of\nunsupervised GraphSAGE, GCN, and GraphRNN-based Region Rollout. The reasoner\nperforms with Upper Confidence Bound for Tree (UCT) to infer semantic\nsub-goals, accounting for trade-offs between exploitation (depth-first\nsearching) and exploration (regretting). The lightweight intermediate-level\nplanner generates instantaneous spatial sub-goal locations via an online\nconstructed Voronoi local graph. The simulation experiments demonstrate that\nour framework achieves better performance in the target-driven navigation tasks\nand generalizes well, which has an 80% improvement compared to the existing\nstate-of-the-art method.

As source code is\ndiscrete and has to strictly stick to the grammar and semantics constraints,\nthe adversarial attack techniques in other domains are not applicable.\nMoreover, the attack techniques specific to deep code models suffer from the\neffectiveness issue due to the enormous attack space. In this work, we propose\na novel adversarial attack technique (i.e., CODA). Its key idea is to use the\ncode differences between the target input and reference inputs (that have small\ncode differences but different prediction results with the target one) to guide\nthe generation of adversarial examples. It considers both structure differences\nand identifier differences to preserve the original semantics. Hence, the\nattack space can be largely reduced as the one constituted by the two kinds of\ncode differences, and thus the attack process can be largely improved by\ndesigning corresponding equivalent structure transformations and identifier\nrenaming transformations. Our experiments on 10 deep code models (i.e., two pre\ntrained models with five code-based tasks) demonstrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of CODA, the naturalness of its generated examples, and its\ncapability of defending against attacks after adversarial fine-tuning. For\nexample, CODA improves the state-of-the-art techniques (i.e., CARROT and ALERT)\nby 79.25% and 72.20% on average in terms of the attack success rate,\nrespectively.",

To this end, we propose a novel efficient Transformer\nTuning (eTT) method that facilitates finetuning ViTs in the FSL tasks. The key\nnovelties come from the newly presented Attentive Prefix Tuning (APT) and\nDomain Residual Adapter (DRA) for the task and backbone tuning, individually.\nSpecifically, in APT, the prefix is projected to new key and value pairs that\nare attached to each self-attention layer to provide the model with\ntask-specific information. Moreover, we design the DRA in the form of learnable\noffset vectors to handle the potential domain gaps between base and novel data.\nTo ensure the APT would not deviate from the initial task-specific information\nmuch, we further propose a novel prototypical regularization, which maximizes\nthe similarity between the projected distribution of prefix and initial\nprototypes, regularizing the update procedure.

The more general parameterized variant, directed long\ndetour, asks for a simple $s$-to-$t$ path of length at least\n$\\mathsf{dist}_{G}(s,t)+k$, for a given parameter $k$. Surprisingly, it is\nstill unknown whether directed detour is polynomial-time solvable on general\ndigraphs.

Multi-site data could enhance the statistical power and\nsample size, while they are often subject to inter-site heterogeneity and\ndata-sharing policies. In this paper, we propose a federated joint estimator,\nNOTEARS-PFL, for simultaneous learning of multiple Bayesian networks (BNs) with\ncontinuous optimization, to identify disease-induced alterations in MDD\npatients. We incorporate information shared between sites and site-specific\ninformation into the proposed federated learning framework to learn\npersonalized BN structures by introducing the group fused lasso penalty. We\ndevelop the alternating direction method of multipliers, where in the local\nupdate step, the neuroimaging data is processed at each local site. Then the\nlearned network structures are transmitted to the center for the global update.\nIn particular, we derive a closed-form expression for the local update step and\nuse the iterative proximal projection method to deal with the group fused lasso\npenalty in the global update step. We evaluate the performance of the proposed\nmethod on both synthetic and real-world multi-site rs-fMRI datasets.

    "abstract": "Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a recently proposed\ndelay-Doppler (DD) domain communication scheme, which has shown promising\nperformance in general wireless communications, especially over high-mobility\nchannels. In this paper, we investigate DD domain Tomlinson-Harashima precoding\n(THP) for downlink multiuser multiple-input and multiple-output OTFS\n(MU-MIMO-OTFS) transmissions. Instead of directly applying THP based on the\nhuge equivalent channel matrix, we propose a simple implementation of THP that\ndoes not require any matrix decomposition or inversion. Such a simple\nimplementation is enabled by the DD domain channel property, i.e., different\nresolvable paths do not share the same delay and Doppler shifts, which makes it\npossible to pre-cancel all the DD domain interference in a symbol-by-symbol\nmanner. We also study the achievable rate performance for the proposed scheme\nby leveraging the information-theoretical equivalent models. In particular, we\nshow that the proposed scheme can achieve a near optimal performance in the\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. More importantly, scaling laws for\nachievable rates with respect to number of antennas and users are derived,\nwhich indicate that the achievable rate increases logarithmically with the\nnumber of antennas and linearly with the number of users.

To this end, we extract\nvector representations of entities from (i) an encyclopedic corpus using a\nlanguage model; and (ii) a knowledge base using a graph neural network. We\ndemonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art\ntopic models across coherency metrics and find that the explicit knowledge\nencoded in the graph-based embeddings provides more coherent topics than the\nimplicit knowledge encoded with the contextualized embeddings of language\nmodels.",

Existing unsupervised hashing\nmethods attempt to exploit the valuable information from samples, which fails\nto take the local geometric structure of unlabeled samples into consideration.\nMoreover, hashing based on auto-encoders aims to minimize the reconstruction\nloss between the input data and binary codes, which ignores the potential\nconsistency and complementarity of multiple sources data. To address the above\nissues, we propose a hashing algorithm based on auto-encoders for multi-view\nbinary clustering, which dynamically learns affinity graphs with low-rank\nconstraints and adopts collaboratively learning between auto-encoders and\naffinity graphs to learn a unified binary code, called Graph-Collaborated\nAuto-Encoder Hashing for Multi-view Binary Clustering (GCAE).

The VoLTE/NR protocols rely on\nthe security features of the underlying LTE/5G network to protect users'\nprivacy such that nobody can monitor calls and learn details about call times,\nduration, and direction. In this paper, we introduce a new privacy attack which\nenables adversaries to analyse encrypted LTE/5G traffic and recover any\nVoLTE/NR call details. We achieve this by implementing a novel mobile-relay\nadversary which is able to remain undetected by using an improved physical\nlayer parameter guessing procedure. This adversary facilitates the recovery of\nencrypted configuration messages exchanged between victim devices and the\nmobile network. We further propose an identity mapping method which enables our\nmobile-relay adversary to link a victim's network identifiers to the phone\nnumber efficiently, requiring a single VoLTE protocol message. We evaluate the\nreal-world performance of our attacks using four modern commercial\noff-the-shelf phones and two representative, commercial network carriers. We\ncollect over 60 hours of traffic between the phones and the mobile networks and\nexecute 160 VoLTE calls, which we use to successfully identify patterns in the\nphysical layer parameter allocation and in VoLTE traffic, respectively. Our\nreal-world experiments show that our mobile-relay works as expected in all test\ncases, and the VoLTE activity logs recovered describe the actual communication\nwith 100% accuracy.

    "abstract": "Code models, such as CodeBERT and CodeT5, offer general-purpose\nrepresentations of code and play a vital role in supporting downstream\nautomated software engineering tasks. Most recently, code models were revealed\nto be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. A code model that is backdoor-attacked\ncan behave normally on clean examples but will produce pre-defined malicious\noutputs on examples injected with triggers that activate the backdoors.\nExisting backdoor attacks on code models use unstealthy and easy-to-detect\ntriggers. This paper aims to investigate the vulnerability of code models with\nstealthy backdoor attacks. To this end, we propose AFRAIDOOR (Adversarial\nFeature as Adaptive Backdoor). AFRAIDOOR achieves stealthiness by leveraging\nadversarial perturbations to inject adaptive triggers into different inputs. We\nevaluate AFRAIDOOR on three widely adopted code models (CodeBERT, PLBART and\nCodeT5) and two downstream tasks (code summarization and method name\nprediction). We find that around 85% of adaptive triggers in AFRAIDOOR bypass\nthe detection in the defense process. By contrast, only less than 12% of the\ntriggers from previous work bypass the defense. When the defense method is not\napplied, both AFRAIDOOR and baselines have almost perfect attack success rates.\nHowever, once a defense is applied, the success rates of baselines decrease\ndramatically to 10.47% and 12.06%, while the success rate of AFRAIDOOR are\n77.05% and 92.98% on the two tasks. Our finding exposes security weaknesses in\ncode models under stealthy backdoor attacks and shows that the state-of-the-art\ndefense method cannot provide sufficient protection. We call for more research\nefforts in understanding security threats to code models and developing more\neffective countermeasures.",

This paper tackles this challenge by introducing a novel\nsystem (SAIDS) that predicts the sentiment, sarcasm and dialect of Arabic\ntweets. SAIDS uses its prediction of sarcasm and dialect as known information\nto predict the sentiment. It uses MARBERT as a language model to generate\nsentence embedding, then passes it to the sarcasm and dialect models, and then\nthe outputs of the three models are concatenated and passed to the sentiment\nanalysis model. Multiple system design setups were experimented with and\nreported. SAIDS was applied to the ArSarcasm-v2 dataset where it outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art model for the sentiment analysis task. By training all\ntasks together, SAIDS achieves results of 75.98 FPN, 59.09 F1-score and 71.13\nF1-score for sentiment analysis, sarcasm detection, and dialect identification\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been considerable effort to promote gender balance\nin the academic environment of Computer Science (CS). However, there is still a\ngender gap at all CS academic levels: from students, to PhD candidates, to\nfaculty members. This general trend is followed by the Department of Computer\nScience at UiT The Arctic University of Norway. To combat this trend within the\nCS environment at UiT, we embarked on structured discussions with students of\nour department. After analyzing the data collected from these discussions, we\nwere able to identify action items that could mitigate the existing gender gap\nat our department. In particular, these discussions elucidated ways to achieve\n(i) a balanced flow of students into CS undergraduate program, (ii) a balanced\nCS study environment, and (iii) a balanced flow of graduates into higher levels\nof the CS academia (e.g., PhD program). This paper presents the results of the\ndiscussions and the subsequent recommendations that we made to the\nadministration of the department. We also provide a road-map that other\ninstitutions could follow to organize similar events as part of their\ngender-balance action plan.",

In this work, control combinations for\na vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB, 5/60 kW/kWh) and a lithium-ion battery\n(LIB, 3.3/9.8 kW/kWh) are investigated for the design of a HESS. Four real-time\nenergy management/power allocation scenarios are considered for the operation\nof the hybrid storage solution through a 15-year economic and energetic\nanalysis.

We then investigate the performance of the defender's ZD strategy\nagainst a boundedly rational attacker, with a comparison of the SSE strategy.\nSpecifically, when the attacker's strategy is close to the BR strategy, the ZD\nstrategy admits a bounded loss for the defender compared with the SSE strategy.\nConversely, when the attacker's strategy is close to the stubborn strategy, the\nZD strategy can bring higher defensive performance for the defender than the\nSSE strategy does.",

In order to verify the\nconcept, a prototype app was developed and tested for both iOS and Android\nsystems, based on the natural-language understanding (NLU) platform Google\nDialogflow. The app and interaction concept were repeatedly tested by users\nwith and without visual impairments.

In an\niterative user-centred design approach, the following research questions were\ninvestigated: Can a visually impaired user rely mainly on speech commands to\nefficiently create and edit a document on mobile devices? User testing found\nthat an interaction concept based on conversational speech commands was easy\nand intuitive for visually impaired users. However, it was also found that\nrelying on speech commands alone created its own obstacles, and that a\ncombination of gestures and voice interaction would be more robust. Future\nresearch and more extensive useability tests should be carried out among\nvisually impaired users in order to optimize the interaction concept.",

In addition, the differences\nbetween the two attack methods in terms of their performance are highlighted\nusing several independent metrics. Several improvements to these models and new\nattacks will be introduced and investigated sequentially, with the goal of\nprogressively improving modeling performance. This will lead to the development\nof an attack capable of almost perfectly predicting the outputs of the\nsimulated PUF. In addition, data from a real optical PUF is examined and both\ncompared to that of the simulation and used to see how the machine learning\nmodels presented would perform in the real world.

In\nthis work, we address these problems by presenting Language-Informed Latent\nActions with Corrections (LILAC), a framework for incorporating and adapting to\nnatural language corrections - \"to the right,\" or \"no, towards the book\" -\nonline, during execution. We explore rich manipulation domains within a shared\nautonomy paradigm. Instead of discrete turn-taking between a human and robot,\nLILAC splits agency between the human and robot: language is an input to a\nlearned model that produces a meaningful, low-dimensional control space that\nthe human can use to guide the robot. Each real-time correction refines the\nhuman's control space, enabling precise, extended behaviors - with the added\nbenefit of requiring only a handful of demonstrations to learn. We evaluate our\napproach via a user study where users work with a Franka Emika Panda\nmanipulator to complete complex manipulation tasks. Compared to existing\nlearned baselines covering both open-loop instruction following and single-turn\nshared autonomy, we show that our corrections-aware approach obtains higher\ntask completion rates, and is subjectively preferred by users because of its\nreliability, precision, and ease of use.",

    "abstract": "As the perception range of LiDAR expands, LiDAR-based 3D object detection\ncontributes ever-increasingly to the long-range perception in autonomous\ndriving. Mainstream 3D object detectors often build dense feature maps, where\nthe cost is quadratic to the perception range, making them hardly scale up to\nthe long-range settings. To enable efficient long-range detection, we first\npropose a fully sparse object detector termed FSD. FSD is built upon the\ngeneral sparse voxel encoder and a novel sparse instance recognition (SIR)\nmodule. SIR groups the points into instances and applies highly-efficient\ninstance-wise feature extraction. The instance-wise grouping sidesteps the\nissue of the center feature missing, which hinders the design of the fully\nsparse architecture. To further enjoy the benefit of fully sparse\ncharacteristic, we leverage temporal information to remove data redundancy and\npropose a super sparse detector named FSD++. FSD++ first generates residual\npoints, which indicate the point changes between consecutive frames. The\nresidual points, along with a few previous foreground points, form the super\nsparse input data, greatly reducing data redundancy and computational overhead.\nWe comprehensively analyze our method on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset,\nand state-of-the-art performance is reported. To showcase the superiority of\nour method in long-range detection, we also conduct experiments on Argoverse 2\nDataset, where the perception range ($200m$) is much larger than Waymo Open\nDataset ($75m$).

Porting existing synchronization primitives to\ndisaggregated shared memory results in poor scalability with the number of\napplication threads because they layer synchronization primitives atop\ncache-coherence substrates, which engenders redundant inter-core\ncommunications. Substantially higher cache-coherence latency ({\\mu}s) with\nsubstantially lower bandwidths in state-of-the-art disaggregated shared memory\ndesigns amplifies the impact of such redundant communications and precludes\nscalability.\nIn this work, we argue for a co-design for the cache-coherence and\nsynchronization layers for better performance scaling of multi-threaded\napplications on disaggregated memory. This is driven by our observation that\nsynchronization primitives are essentially a generalization of cache-coherence\nprotocols in time and space.

    "title": "Identifying Different Student Clusters in Functional Programming  Assignments: From Quick Learners to Struggling Students",
    "abstract": "Instructors and students alike are often focused on the grade in programming\nassignments as a key measure of how well a student is mastering the material\nand whether a student is struggling. This can be, however, misleading.\nEspecially when students have access to auto-graders, their grades may be\nheavily skewed. In this paper, we analyze student assignment submission data\ncollected from a functional programming course taught at McGill university\nincorporating a wide range of features. In addition to the grade, we consider\nactivity time data, time spent, and the number of static errors. This allows us\nto identify four clusters of students: \"Quick-learning\", \"Hardworking\",\n\"Satisficing\", and \"Struggling\" through cluster algorithms. We then analyze how\nwork habits, working duration, the range of errors, and the ability to fix\nerrors impact different clusters of students. This structured analysis provides\nvaluable insights for instructors to actively help different types of students\nand emphasize different aspects of their overall course design. It also\nprovides insights for students themselves to understand which aspects they\nstill struggle with and allows them to seek clarification and adjust their work\nhabits.",

    "abstract": "We propose a stealthy and powerful backdoor attack on neural networks based\non data poisoning (DP). In contrast to previous attacks, both the poison and\nthe trigger in our method are stealthy. We are able to change the model's\nclassification of samples from a source class to a target class chosen by the\nattacker. We do so by using a small number of poisoned training samples with\nnearly imperceptible perturbations, without changing their labels. At inference\ntime, we use a stealthy perturbation added to the attacked samples as a\ntrigger. This perturbation is crafted as a universal adversarial perturbation\n(UAP), and the poison is crafted using gradient alignment coupled to this\ntrigger. Our method is highly efficient in crafting time compared to previous\nmethods and requires only a trained surrogate model without additional\nretraining. Our attack achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of attack\nsuccess rate while maintaining high accuracy on clean samples.",

Some researchers have explored its\nconfidentiality and designed some algorithms to attack training data sets, but\nthese algorithms all have their own limitations. Therefore, most people still\nbelieve that local machine learning gradient information is safe and reliable.\nIn this paper, an algorithm based on gradient features is designed to attack\nthe federated learning model in order to attract more attention to the security\nof federated learning systems. In federated learning system, gradient contains\nlittle information compared with the original training data set, but this\nproject intends to restore the original training image data through gradient\ninformation. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has excellent performance in\nimage processing. Therefore, the federated learning model of this project is\nequipped with Convolutional Neural Network structure, and the model is trained\nby using image data sets. The algorithm calculates the virtual gradient by\ngenerating virtual image labels. Then the virtual gradient is matched with the\nreal gradient to restore the original image. This attack algorithm is written\nin Python language, uses cat and dog classification Kaggle data sets, and\ngradually extends from the full connection layer to the convolution layer, thus\nimproving the universality. At present, the average squared error between the\ndata recovered by this algorithm and the original image information is\napproximately 5, and the vast majority of images can be completely restored\naccording to the gradient information given, indicating that the gradient of\nfederated learning system is not absolutely safe and reliable.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of asynchronous wait-free runtime verification\nof linearizability for concurrent shared memory implementations, where one\nseeks for an asynchronous wait-free concurrent shared memory algorithm for\nverifying at runtime that the current execution of a given concurrent\nimplementation is linearizable. It proposes an interactive model for\ndistributed runtime verification of correctness conditions, and shows that it\nis impossible to runtime verify linearizability for some common sequential\nobjects such as queues, stacks, sets, priority queues, counters and the\nconsensus problem, regardless of the consensus power of base objects. Then, the\npaper argues that actually a stronger version of the problem can be solved, if\nlinearizability is indirectly verified. Namely, it shows that (1)\nlinearizability of a class of concurrent implementations can be distributed\nruntime strongly verified using only read/write base objects (i.e. without the\nneed of consensus), and (2) any implementation can be transformed to its\ncounterpart in the class using only read/write objects too. As far as we know,\nthis is the first distributed runtime verification algorithm for any\ncorrectness condition that is fully asynchronous and fault-tolerant. As a\nby-product, a simple and generic methodology for the design of self-enforced\nlinearizable implementations is obtained. This type implementations produce\noutputs that are guaranteed linearizable, and are able to produce a certificate\nof it, which allows the design of concurrent systems in a modular manner with\naccountable and forensic guarantees. We are not aware of prior concurrent\nimplementations in the literature with such properties. These results hold not\nonly for linearizability but for a correctness condition that includes\ngeneralizations of it such as set-linearizability and interval-linearizability.",

Both\nof our attention modules are model-agnostic network layers that can be plugged\ninto existing point cloud transformers for end-to-end training.

    "title": "Restarts subject to approximate sharpness: A parameter-free and optimal  scheme for first-order methods",
    "abstract": "Sharpness is an almost generic assumption in continuous optimization that\nbounds the distance from minima by objective function suboptimality. It leads\nto the acceleration of first-order methods via restarts. However, sharpness\ninvolves problem-specific constants that are typically unknown, and previous\nrestart schemes reduce convergence rates. Moreover, such schemes are\nchallenging to apply in the presence of noise or approximate model classes\n(e.g., in compressive imaging or learning problems), and typically assume that\nthe first-order method used produces feasible iterates. We consider the\nassumption of approximate sharpness, a generalization of sharpness that\nincorporates an unknown constant perturbation to the objective function error.\nThis constant offers greater robustness (e.g., with respect to noise or\nrelaxation of model classes) for finding approximate minimizers. By employing a\nnew type of search over the unknown constants, we design a restart scheme that\napplies to general first-order methods and does not require the first-order\nmethod to produce feasible iterates. Our scheme maintains the same convergence\nrate as when assuming knowledge of the constants. The rates of convergence we\nobtain for various first-order methods either match the optimal rates or\nimprove on previously established rates for a wide range of problems. We\nshowcase our restart scheme on several examples and point to future\napplications and developments of our framework and theory.",

Conventional diagnosis of\nbrain tumour involves some tests and procedure which may include the\nconsideration of medical history, physical examination, imaging tests (such as\nCT or MRI scans), and biopsy (removal and examination of a small piece of the\ntumor tissue). These procedures, while effective, are mentally strenuous and\ntime demanding due to the manual examination of the brain scans and the\nthorough evaluation of test results. It has been established in lots of medical\nresearch that brain tumours diagnosed and treated early generally tends to have\na better prognosis. Deep learning techniques have evolved over the years and\nhave demonstrated impressive and faster outcomes in the classification of brain\ntumours in medical imaging, with very little to no human interference. This\nstudy proposes a model for the early detection of brain tumours using a\ncombination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and extreme gradient\nboosting (XGBoost). The proposed model, named C-XGBoost has a lower model\ncomplexity compared to purely CNNs, making it easier to train and less prone to\noverfitting. It is also better able to handle imbalanced and unstructured data,\nwhich are common issues in real-world medical image classification tasks.

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) applied to breast tissue segmentation in magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) has received increased attention in the last decade,\nhowever, the domain shift which arises from different vendors, acquisition\nprotocols, and biological heterogeneity, remains an important but challenging\nobstacle on the path towards clinical implementation. Recently, unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (UDA) methods have attempted to mitigate this problem by\nincorporating self-training with contrastive learning. To better exploit the\nunderlying semantic information of the image at different levels, we propose a\nMulti-level Semantic-guided Contrastive Domain Adaptation (MSCDA) framework to\nalign the feature representation between domains. In particular, we extend the\ncontrastive loss by incorporating pixel-to-pixel, pixel-to-centroid, and\ncentroid-to-centroid contrasts to integrate semantic information of images. We\nutilize a category-wise cross-domain sampling strategy to sample anchors from\ntarget images and build a hybrid memory bank to store samples from source\nimages. Two breast MRI datasets were retrospectively collected: The source\ndataset contains non-contrast MRI examinations from 11 healthy volunteers and\nthe target dataset contains contrast-enhanced MRI examinations of 134 invasive\nbreast cancer patients. We set up experiments from source T2W image to target\ndynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-T1W image (T2W-to-T1W) and from source T1W\nimage to target T2W image (T1W-to-T2W). The proposed method achieved Dice\nsimilarity coefficient (DSC) of 89.2\\% and 84.0\\% in T2W-to-T1W and T1W-to-T2W,\nrespectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, good performance\nis still achieved with a smaller source dataset, proving that our framework is\nlabel-efficient.",

    "abstract": "Structural components are typically exposed to dynamic loading, such as\nearthquakes, wind, and explosions. Structural engineers should be able to\nconduct real-time analysis in the aftermath or during extreme disaster events\nrequiring immediate corrections to avoid fatal failures. As a result, it is\ncrucial to predict dynamic stress distributions during highly disruptive events\nin real-time. Currently available high-fidelity methods, such as Finite Element\nModels (FEMs), suffer from their inherent high complexity and are\ncomputationally prohibitive. Therefore, to reduce computational cost while\npreserving accuracy, a deep learning model, Neuro-DynaStress, is proposed to\npredict the entire sequence of stress distribution based on finite element\nsimulations using a partial differential equation (PDE) solver. The model was\ndesigned and trained to use the geometry, boundary conditions and sequence of\nloads as input and predict the sequences of high-resolution stress contours.\nThe performance of the proposed framework is compared to finite element\nsimulations using a PDE solver.",

Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression is used to\napproximate two-dimensional spatial distribution of the rock permeability.\nParameters of the kernel regression are tuned by solving the optimization\nproblem in which, for each well placed in an oil reservoir, we minimize the\ndifference between the actual and predicted values of (i) absolute permeability\nat the well location (from well logging); (ii) absolute integral permeability\nof the domain around the well and (iii) skin factor (from well tests). Inverse\nproblem is solved via multiple solutions to forward problems, in which we\nestimate the integral permeability of reservoir surrounding a well and the skin\nfactor by the surrogate model. The last one is developed using an artificial\nneural network trained on the physics-based synthetic dataset generated using\nthe procedure comprising the numerical simulation of bottomhole pressure\ndecline curve in reservoir simulator followed by its interpretation using a\nsemi-analytical reservoir model. The developed method for reservoir\npermeability map construction is applied to the available reservoir model (Egg\nModel) with highly heterogeneous permeability distribution due to the presence\nof highly-permeable channels. We showed that the constructed permeability map\nis hydrodynamically similar to the original one. Numerical simulations of\nproduction in the reservoir with constructed and original permeability maps are\nquantitatively similar in terms of the pore pressure and fluid saturations\ndistribution at the end of the simulation period.

    "abstract": "Applying new computing paradigms like quantum computing to the field of\nmachine learning has recently gained attention. However, as high-dimensional\nreal-world applications are not yet feasible to be solved using purely quantum\nhardware, hybrid methods using both classical and quantum machine learning\nparadigms have been proposed. For instance, transfer learning methods have been\nshown to be successfully applicable to hybrid image classification tasks.\nNevertheless, beneficial circuit architectures still need to be explored.\nTherefore, tracing the impact of the chosen circuit architecture and\nparameterization is crucial for the development of beneficially applicable\nhybrid methods. However, current methods include processes where both parts are\ntrained concurrently, therefore not allowing for a strict separability of\nclassical and quantum impact. Thus, those architectures might produce models\nthat yield a superior prediction accuracy whilst employing the least possible\nquantum impact. To tackle this issue, we propose Sequential Quantum Enhanced\nTraining (SEQUENT) an improved architecture and training process for the\ntraceable application of quantum computing methods to hybrid machine learning.\nFurthermore, we provide formal evidence for the disadvantage of current methods\nand preliminary experimental results as a proof-of-concept for the\napplicability of SEQUENT.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Gaussian Processes (GP)-based filters, which have been effectively\nused for various applications including electrocardiogram (ECG) filtering can\nbe computationally demanding and the choice of their hyperparameters is\ntypically ad hoc. Methods: We develop a data-driven GP filter to address both\nissues, using the notion of the ECG phase domain -- a time-warped\nrepresentation of the ECG beats onto a fixed number of samples and aligned\nR-peaks, which is assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. Under this\nassumption, the computation of the sample mean and covariance matrix is\nsimplified, enabling an efficient implementation of the GP filter in a\ndata-driven manner, with no ad hoc hyperparameters. The proposed filter is\nevaluated and compared with a state-of-the-art wavelet-based filter, on the\nPhysioNet QT Database. The performance is evaluated by measuring the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement of the filter at SNR levels ranging\nfrom -5 to 30dB, in 5dB steps, using additive noise. For a clinical evaluation,\nthe error between the estimated QT-intervals of the original and filtered\nsignals is measured and compared with the benchmark filter. Results: It is\nshown that the proposed GP filter outperforms the benchmark filter for all the\ntested noise levels. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art filter in terms\nof QT-interval estimation error bias and variance. Conclusion: The proposed GP\nfilter is a versatile technique for preprocessing the ECG in clinical and\nresearch applications, is applicable to ECG of arbitrary lengths and sampling\nfrequencies, and provides confidence intervals for its performance.",

    "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Digital Pathology has\nbeen increasing over the past years. Nowadays, applications of deep learning\n(DL) methods to diagnose cancer from whole-slide images (WSI) are, more than\never, a reality within different research groups. Nonetheless, the development\nof these systems was limited by a myriad of constraints regarding the lack of\ntraining samples, the scaling difficulties, the opaqueness of DL methods, and,\nmore importantly, the lack of clinical validation. As such, we propose a system\ndesigned specifically for the diagnosis of colorectal samples. The construction\nof such a system consisted of four stages: (1) a careful data collection and\nannotation process, which resulted in one of the largest WSI colorectal samples\ndatasets; (2) the design of an interpretable mixed-supervision scheme to\nleverage the domain knowledge introduced by pathologists through spatial\nannotations; (3) the development of an effective sampling approach based on the\nexpected severeness of each tile, which decreased the computation cost by a\nfactor of almost 6x; (4) the creation of a prototype that integrates the full\nset of features of the model to be evaluated in clinical practice. During these\nstages, the proposed method was evaluated in four separate test sets, two of\nthem are external and completely independent. On the largest of those sets, the\nproposed approach achieved an accuracy of 93.44%. DL for colorectal samples is\na few steps closer to stop being research exclusive and to become fully\nintegrated in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The resolution and contrast of microscope imaging is often affected by\naberrations introduced by imperfect optical systems and inhomogeneous\nrefractive structures in specimens. Adaptive optics (AO) compensates these\naberrations and restores diffraction limited performance. A wide range of AO\nsolutions have been introduced, often tailored to a specific microscope type or\napplication. Until now, a universal AO solution -- one that can be readily\ntransferred between microscope modalities -- has not been deployed. We propose\nversatile and fast aberration correction using a physics-based machine learning\n(ML) assisted wavefront-sensorless AO control method. Unlike previous ML\nmethods, we used a bespoke neural network (NN) architecture, designed using\nphysical understanding of image formation, that was embedded in the control\nloop of the microscope. The approach means that not only is the resulting NN\norders of magnitude simpler than previous NN methods, but the concept is\ntranslatable across microscope modalities. We demonstrated the method on a\ntwo-photon, a three-photon and a widefield three-dimensional (3D) structured\nillumination microscope. Results showed that the method outperformed\ncommonly-used modal-based sensorless AO methods. We also showed that our\nML-based method was robust in a range of challenging imaging conditions, such\nas extended 3D sample structures, specimen motion, low signal to noise ratio\nand activity-induced fluorescence fluctuations. Moreover, as the bespoke\narchitecture encapsulated physical understanding of the imaging process, the\ninternal NN configuration was no-longer a ``black box'', but provided physical\ninsights on internal workings, which could influence future designs.",
