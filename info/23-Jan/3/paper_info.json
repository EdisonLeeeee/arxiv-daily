    "title": "Evaluating Alternative Glyph Design for Showing Large-Magnitude-Range  Quantum Spins",
    "abstract": "We present experimental results to explore a form of bivariate glyphs for\nrepresenting large-magnitude-range vectors. The glyphs meet two conditions: (1)\ntwo visual dimensions are separable; and (2) one of the two visual dimensions\nuses a categorical representation (e.g., a categorical colormap). We evaluate\nhow much these two conditions determine the bivariate glyphs' effectiveness.\nThe first experiment asks participants to perform three local tasks requiring\nreading no more than two glyphs. The second experiment scales up the search\nspace in global tasks when participants must look at the entire scene of\nhundreds of vector glyphs to get an answer. Our results support that the first\ncondition is necessary for local tasks when a few items are compared. But it is\nnot enough to understand a large amount of data. The second condition is\nnecessary for perceiving global structures of examining very complex datasets.\nParticipants' comments reveal that the categorical features in the bivariate\nglyphs trigger emergent optimal viewers' behaviors. This work contributes to\nperceptually accurate glyph representations for revealing patterns from large\nscientific results.

We test our\napproach on several benchmark control problems, and we explain its success in\nguiding intrinsically motivated behaviors by relating our information-theoretic\ncontrol function to fundamental properties of the dynamical system representing\nthe combined agent-environment system.

    "abstract": "Crowdsourcing has emerged as an effective platform to label a large volume of\ndata in a cost- and time-efficient manner. Most previous works have focused on\ndesigning an efficient algorithm to recover only the ground-truth labels of the\ndata. In this paper, we consider multi-choice crowdsourced labeling with the\ngoal of recovering not only the ground truth but also the most confusing answer\nand the confusion probability. The most confusing answer provides useful\ninformation about the task by revealing the most plausible answer other than\nthe ground truth and how plausible it is. To theoretically analyze such\nscenarios, we propose a model where there are top-two plausible answers for\neach task, distinguished from the rest of choices. Task difficulty is\nquantified by the confusion probability between the top two, and worker\nreliability is quantified by the probability of giving an answer among the top\ntwo. Under this model, we propose a two-stage inference algorithm to infer the\ntop-two answers as well as the confusion probability. We show that our\nalgorithm achieves the minimax optimal convergence rate. We conduct both\nsynthetic and real-data experiments and demonstrate that our algorithm\noutperforms other recent algorithms.

Despite these advances\nin practice, most theoretical work pertains to finite state and action spaces.\nWe propose building a theoretical understanding of continuous state and action\nspaces by employing a geometric lens. Central to our work is the idea that the\ntransition dynamics induce a low dimensional manifold of reachable states\nembedded in the high-dimensional nominal state space. We prove that, under\ncertain conditions, the dimensionality of this manifold is at most the\ndimensionality of the action space plus one. This is the first result of its\nkind, linking the geometry of the state space to the dimensionality of the\naction space. We empirically corroborate this upper bound for four MuJoCo\nenvironments. We further demonstrate the applicability of our result by\nlearning a policy in this low dimensional representation. To do so we introduce\nan algorithm that learns a mapping to a low dimensional representation, as a\nnarrow hidden layer of a deep neural network, in tandem with the policy using\nDDPG. Our experiments show that a policy learnt this way perform on par or\nbetter for four MuJoCo control suite tasks.",

To avert this, the existing strategies for VAEs focus\non adjusting the tradeoff by introducing hyperparameters, deriving a tighter\nbound under some mild assumptions, or decomposing the loss components per\ncertain neural settings. VAEs still suffer from uncertain tradeoff learning.We\npropose a novel evolutionary variational autoencoder (eVAE) building on the\nvariational information bottleneck (VIB) theory and integrative evolutionary\nneural learning. eVAE integrates a variational genetic algorithm into VAE with\nvariational evolutionary operators including variational mutation, crossover,\nand evolution.

Apart from learning\na lossy compression and representation of data under the VIB assumption, eVAE\npresents an evolutionary paradigm to tune critical factors of VAEs and deep\nneural networks and addresses the premature convergence and random search\nproblem by integrating evolutionary optimization into deep learning.\nExperiments show that eVAE addresses the KL-vanishing problem for text\ngeneration with low reconstruction loss, generates all disentangled factors\nwith sharp images, and improves the image generation quality,respectively. eVAE\nachieves better reconstruction loss, disentanglement, and generation-inference\nbalance than its competitors.",

The data collected is\nthen thoroughly analyzed and explained to understand all this information. This\nexperiment can be recreated and makes use of many open-source tools to\nsuccessfully create a honeypot system.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial imitation learning (AIL) has become a popular alternative to\nsupervised imitation learning that reduces the distribution shift suffered by\nthe latter. However, AIL requires effective exploration during an online\nreinforcement learning phase. In this work, we show that the standard, naive\napproach to exploration can manifest as a suboptimal local maximum if a policy\nlearned with AIL sufficiently matches the expert distribution without fully\nlearning the desired task. This can be particularly catastrophic for\nmanipulation tasks, where the difference between an expert and a non-expert\nstate-action pair is often subtle. We present Learning from Guided Play (LfGP),\na framework in which we leverage expert demonstrations of multiple exploratory,\nauxiliary tasks in addition to a main task. The addition of these auxiliary\ntasks forces the agent to explore states and actions that standard AIL may\nlearn to ignore. Additionally, this particular formulation allows for the\nreusability of expert data between main tasks. Our experimental results in a\nchallenging multitask robotic manipulation domain indicate that LfGP\nsignificantly outperforms both AIL and behaviour cloning, while also being more\nexpert sample efficient than these baselines. To explain this performance gap,\nwe provide further analysis of a toy problem that highlights the coupling\nbetween a local maximum and poor exploration, and also visualize the\ndifferences between the learned models from AIL and LfGP.",

    "abstract": "Network administrators are often interested in detecting TCP-level packet\nreordering to diagnose performance problems and neutralize attacks. However,\npacket reordering is expensive to measure, because each packet must be\nprocessed relative to the TCP sequence number of its predecessor in the same\nflow. Due to the volume of traffic, the detection of packet reordering should\ntake place in the data plane of the network devices as the packets fly by.\nHowever, restrictions on the memory size and the number of memory accesses per\npacket make it impossible to design an efficient algorithm for pinpointing the\nflows with heavy packet reordering.\nIn practice, packet reordering is typically a property of a network path, due\nto a congested or flaky link. Flows traversing the same path are correlated in\ntheir out-of-orderness, and aggregating out-of-order statistics at the IP\nprefix level would provide useful diagnostic information. In this paper, we\npresent efficient algorithms for identifying IP prefixes with heavy packet\nreordering under memory restrictions. First, we analyze as much of the traffic\nas possible by going after the largest flows. Next, we sample as many flows as\npossible, regardless of their sizes. To achieve the best of both worlds, we\nalso combine these two methods. In all algorithms, we resolve the challenging\ninterplay between measuring at the flow level and aggregating at the prefix\nlevel by allocating memory using prefix information. Our simulation experiments\nusing packet traces from a campus network show that our algorithms are\neffective at identifying IP prefixes with heavy packet reordering using\nmoderate memory resources.",

Moreover, intravascular\nmodalities suffer from several non-rigid motion-induced distortions arising\nfrom distortions in the imaging catheter path. To address these issues, we here\npresent a semi-automatic segmentation-based framework for both rigid and\nnon-rigid matching of intravascular images to CCTA images.

We empirically quantify\nsuch inconsistencies in the simple scenario of bigrams for two common styles of\nmasked language models: T5-style and BERT-style.

In this paper we\nintroduce a local integral boundary domain method with a stable calculation\nbased on Radial Basis Functions (RBF) approximations, in the context of wave\nchaos in acoustics and dielectric microresonator problems. RBFs have been\ngaining popularity recently for solving partial differential equations\nnumerically, becoming an extremely effective tool for interpolation on\nscattered node sets in several dimensions with high-order accuracy and\nflexibility for nontrivial geometries. One key issue with infinitely smooth\nRBFs is the choice of a suitable value for the shape parameter which controls\nthe flatness of the function. It is observed that best accuracy is often\nachieved when the shape parameter tends to zero. However, the system of\ndiscrete equations obtained from the interpolation matrices becomes\nill-conditioned, which imposes severe limits to the attainable accuracy. A few\nnumerical algorithms have been presented that are able to stably compute an\ninterpolant, even in the increasingly flat basis function limit. We present the\nrecently developed Stabilized Local Boundary Domain Integral Method in the\ncontext of boundary integral methods that improves the solution of the\nHelmholtz equation with RBFs. Numerical results for small shape parameters that\nstabilize the error are shown. Accuracy and comparison with other methods are\nalso discussed for various case studies. Applications in wave chaos, acoustics\nand dielectric microresonators are discussed to showcase the virtues of the\nmethod, which is computationally efficient and well suited to the kind of\ngeometries with arbitrary shape domains.",

    "abstract": "To enable innovative applications and services, both industry and academia\nare exploring new technologies for sixth generation (6G) communications. One of\nthe promising candidates is fluid antenna system (FAS). Unlike existing\nsystems, FAS is a novel communication technology where its antenna can freely\nchange its position and shape within a given space. Compared to the traditional\nsystems, this unique capability has the potential of providing higher diversity\nand interference-free communications. Nevertheless, the performance limits of\nFAS remain unclear as its channels and system properties are highly peculiar to\nbe analyzed. To address this, we approximate the outage probability and\ndiversity gain of FAS in closed-form expressions. We then propose a suboptimal\nFAS with $N^{*}$ ports, where a significant gain can be obtained over FAS with\n$N^{*}-1$ ports whilst FAS with $N^{*}+1$ ports only yields marginal\nimprovement over the proposed suboptimal FAS. In this paper, we also provide\nanalytical and simulation results to unfold the key factors that affect the\nperformance of FAS.

In contrast to SDP, CDP only requires privacy guarantees to hold\nagainst computationally-bounded adversaries rather than\ncomputationally-unbounded statistical adversaries. Despite the question being\nraised explicitly in several works (e.g., Bun, Chen, and Vadhan, TCC 2016), it\nhas remained tantalizingly open whether there is any task achievable with the\nCDP notion but not the SDP notion. Even a candidate such task is unknown.\nIndeed, it is even unclear what the truth could be!\nIn this work, we give the first construction of a task achievable with the\nCDP notion but not the SDP notion. More specifically, under strong but\nplausible cryptographic assumptions, we construct a task for which there exists\nan $\\varepsilon$-CDP mechanism with $\\varepsilon = O(1)$ achieving $1-o(1)$\nutility, but any $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-SDP mechanism, including\ncomputationally unbounded ones, that achieves a constant utility must use\neither a super-constant $\\varepsilon$ or a non-negligible $\\delta$. To prove\nthis, we introduce a new approach for showing that a mechanism satisfies CDP:\nfirst we show that a mechanism is \"private\" against a certain class of decision\ntree adversaries, and then we use cryptographic constructions to \"lift\" this\ninto privacy against computational adversaries.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there\nis no existing research concentrating on how many edges should be removed at\nleast to make an arbitrary node in k-core collapse. Therefore, in this paper,\nwe make the first attempt to study the Targeted k-node Collapse Problem (TNCP)\nwith four novel contributions. Firstly, we offer the general definition of TNCP\nproblem with the proof of its NP-hardness. Secondly, in order to address the\nTNCP problem, we propose a heuristic algorithm named TNC and its improved\nversion named ATNC for implementations on large-scale networks. After that, the\nexperiments on 16 real-world networks across various domains verify the\nsuperiority of our proposed algorithms over 4 baseline methods along with\ndetailed comparisons and analyses.

    "abstract": "Almost 80 million Americans suffer from hair loss due to aging, stress,\nmedication, or genetic makeup. Hair and scalp-related diseases often go\nunnoticed in the beginning. Sometimes, a patient cannot differentiate between\nhair loss and regular hair fall. Diagnosing hair-related diseases is\ntime-consuming as it requires professional dermatologists to perform visual and\nmedical tests. Because of that, the overall diagnosis gets delayed, which\nworsens the severity of the illness. Due to the image-processing ability,\nneural network-based applications are used in various sectors, especially\nhealthcare and health informatics, to predict deadly diseases like cancers and\ntumors. These applications assist clinicians and patients and provide an\ninitial insight into early-stage symptoms. In this study, we used a deep\nlearning approach that successfully predicts three main types of hair loss and\nscalp-related diseases: alopecia, psoriasis, and folliculitis. However, limited\nstudy in this area, unavailability of a proper dataset, and degree of variety\namong the images scattered over the internet made the task challenging. 150\nimages were obtained from various sources and then preprocessed by denoising,\nimage equalization, enhancement, and data balancing, thereby minimizing the\nerror rate. After feeding the processed data into the 2D convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) model, we obtained overall training accuracy of 96.2%, with a\nvalidation accuracy of 91.1%. The precision and recall score of alopecia,\npsoriasis, and folliculitis are 0.895, 0.846, and 1.0, respectively. We also\ncreated a dataset of the scalp images for future prospective researchers.",

Sampling\nrate adaption which dynamically configures the sampling rates of industrial IoT\ndevices according to network conditions, is the key in minimizing the service\ndelay. In this paper, we investigate the collaborative DNN inference problem in\nindustrial IoT networks.

Since CMDP cannot be directly solved by general\nreinforcement learning (RL) algorithms due to the intractable long-term\nconstraints, we first transform the CMDP into an MDP by leveraging the Lyapunov\noptimization technique. Then, a deep RL-based algorithm is proposed to solve\nthe MDP.

More concretely,\nwe first design a structure called guided quantization self-distillation\n(GQSD), which is an innovative idea for realizing lightweight through the\nsynergy of quantization and distillation. The training process of the\nquantization model is guided by its full-precision model, which is time-saving\nand cost-saving without preparing a huge pre-trained model in advance. Second,\nwe put forward a hybrid quantization (HQ) module to obtain the optimal bit\nwidth automatically under a constrained condition where a threshold for\ndistribution distance between the center and samples is applied in the weight\nvalue search space. Third, in order to improve information transformation, we\npropose a one-to-one self-teaching (OST) module to give the student network a\nability of self-judgment. A switch control machine (SCM) builds a bridge\nbetween the student network and teacher network in the same location to help\nthe teacher to reduce wrong guidance and impart vital knowledge to the student.\nThis distillation method allows a model to learn from itself and gain\nsubstantial improvement without any additional supervision. Extensive\nexperiments on a multimodal dataset (VEDAI) and single-modality datasets (DOTA,\nNWPU, and DIOR) show that object detection based on GHOST outperforms the\nexisting detectors.

In the most general setting, the monotone\ndecision tree height (or size) can be viewed as a measure of non-monotonicity\nof a given Boolean function. We also study the restriction of the model by\nrestricting (in terms of circuit complexity) the monotone functions that can be\nqueried at each node. This naturally leads to complexity classes of the form\nDT(mon-C) for any circuit complexity class C, where the height of the tree is\nO(log n), and the query functions can be computed by monotone circuits in the\nclass C. In the above context, we prove the following characterizations and\nbounds.\nFor any Boolean function f, we show that the minimum monotone decision tree\nheight can be exactly characterized (both in the adaptive and non-adaptive\nversions of the model) in terms of its alternation (alt(f) is defined as the\nmaximum number of times that the function value changes, in any chain in the\nBoolean lattice). We also characterize the non-adaptive decision tree height\nwith a natural generalization of certification complexity of a function.\nSimilarly, we determine the complexity of non-deterministic and randomized\nvariants of monotone decision trees in terms of alt(f).\nWe show that DT(mon-C) = C when C contains monotone circuits for the\nthreshold functions (for e.g., if C = TC0). For C = AC0, we are able to show\nthat any function in AC0 can be computed by a sub-linear height monotone\ndecision tree with queries having monotone AC0 circuits.

    "abstract": "The ability for an agent to continuously learn new skills without\ncatastrophically forgetting existing knowledge is of critical importance for\nthe development of generally intelligent agents. Most methods devised to\naddress this problem depend heavily on well-defined task boundaries, and thus\ndepend on human supervision. Our task-agnostic method, Self-Activating Neural\nEnsembles (SANE), uses a modular architecture designed to avoid catastrophic\nforgetting without making any such assumptions. At the beginning of each\ntrajectory, a module in the SANE ensemble is activated to determine the agent's\nnext policy. During training, new modules are created as needed and only\nactivated modules are updated to ensure that unused modules remain unchanged.\nThis system enables our method to retain and leverage old skills, while growing\nand learning new ones. We demonstrate our approach on visually rich\nprocedurally generated environments.",

    "abstract": "Charisma is considered as one's ability to attract and potentially also\ninfluence others. Clearly, there can be considerable interest from an\nartificial intelligence's (AI) perspective to provide it with such skill.\nBeyond, a plethora of use cases opens up for computational measurement of human\ncharisma, such as for tutoring humans in the acquisition of charisma, mediating\nhuman-to-human conversation, or identifying charismatic individuals in big\nsocial data. A number of models exist that base charisma on various dimensions,\noften following the idea that charisma is given if someone could and would help\nothers. Examples include influence (could help) and affability (would help) in\nscientific studies or power (could help), presence, and warmth (both would\nhelp) as a popular concept. Modelling high levels in these dimensions for\nhumanoid robots or virtual agents, seems accomplishable. Beyond, also automatic\nmeasurement appears quite feasible with the recent advances in the related\nfields of Affective Computing and Social Signal Processing. Here, we,\nthereforem present a blueprint for building machines that can appear\ncharismatic, but also analyse the charisma of others. To this end, we first\nprovide the psychological perspective including different models of charisma\nand behavioural cues of it. We then switch to conversational charisma in spoken\nlanguage as an exemplary modality that is essential for human-human and\nhuman-computer conversations. The computational perspective then deals with the\nrecognition and generation of charismatic behaviour by AI. This includes an\noverview of the state of play in the field and the aforementioned blueprint. We\nthen name exemplary use cases of computational charismatic skills before\nswitching to ethical aspects and concluding this overview and perspective on\nbuilding charisma-enabled AI.",

    "abstract": "Audio-Visual scene understanding is a challenging problem due to the\nunstructured spatial-temporal relations that exist in the audio signals and\nspatial layouts of different objects and various texture patterns in the visual\nimages. Recently, many studies have focused on abstracting features from\nconvolutional neural networks while the learning of explicit semantically\nrelevant frames of sound signals and visual images has been overlooked. To this\nend, we present an end-to-end framework, namely attentional graph convolutional\nnetwork (AGCN), for structure-aware audio-visual scene representation. First,\nthe spectrogram of sound and input image is processed by a backbone network for\nfeature extraction. Then, to build multi-scale hierarchical information of\ninput features, we utilize an attention fusion mechanism to aggregate features\nfrom multiple layers of the backbone network. Notably, to well represent the\nsalient regions and contextual information of audio-visual inputs, the salient\nacoustic graph (SAG) and contextual acoustic graph (CAG), salient visual graph\n(SVG), and contextual visual graph (CVG) are constructed for the audio-visual\nscene representation. Finally, the constructed graphs pass through a graph\nconvolutional network for structure-aware audio-visual scene recognition.\nExtensive experimental results on the audio, visual and audio-visual scene\nrecognition datasets show that promising results have been achieved by the AGCN\nmethods.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel framework dubbed peer learning to deal with\nthe problem of biased scene graph generation (SGG). This framework uses\npredicate sampling and consensus voting (PSCV) to encourage different peers to\nlearn from each other, improving model diversity and mitigating bias in SGG. To\naddress the heavily long-tailed distribution of predicate classes, we propose\nto use predicate sampling to divide and conquer this issue. As a result, the\nmodel is less biased and makes more balanced predicate predictions.\nSpecifically, one peer may not be sufficiently diverse to discriminate between\ndifferent levels of predicate distributions. Therefore, we sample the data\ndistribution based on frequency of predicates into sub-distributions, selecting\nhead, body, and tail classes to combine and feed to different peers as\ncomplementary predicate knowledge during the training process. The\ncomplementary predicate knowledge of these peers is then ensembled utilizing a\nconsensus voting strategy, which simulates a civilized voting process in our\nsociety that emphasizes the majority opinion and diminishes the minority\nopinion. This approach ensures that the learned representations of each peer\nare optimally adapted to the various data distributions. Extensive experiments\non the Visual Genome dataset demonstrate that PSCV outperforms previous\nmethods.

    "abstract": "Recent investigations on rotation invariance for 3D point clouds have been\ndevoted to devising rotation-invariant feature descriptors or learning\ncanonical spaces where objects are semantically aligned. Examinations of\nlearning frameworks for invariance have seldom been looked into. In this work,\nwe review rotation invariance in terms of point cloud registration and propose\nan effective framework for rotation invariance learning via three sequential\nstages, namely rotation-invariant shape encoding, aligned feature integration,\nand deep feature registration. We first encode shape descriptors constructed\nwith respect to reference frames defined over different scales, e.g., local\npatches and global topology, to generate rotation-invariant latent shape codes.\nWithin the integration stage, we propose Aligned Integration Transformer to\nproduce a discriminative feature representation by integrating point-wise self-\nand cross-relations established within the shape codes. Meanwhile, we adopt\nrigid transformations between reference frames to align the shape codes for\nfeature consistency across different scales. Finally, the deep integrated\nfeature is registered to both rotation-invariant shape codes to maximize\nfeature similarities, such that rotation invariance of the integrated feature\nis preserved and shared semantic information is implicitly extracted from shape\ncodes. Experimental results on 3D shape classification, part segmentation, and\nretrieval tasks prove the feasibility of our work. Our project page is released\nat: https://rotation3d.github.io/.",

We introduce the task of proactively forecasting\npopularities of sentences within online news documents solely utilizing their\nnatural language content. We model sentence-specific popularity forecasting as\na sequence regression task. For training our models, we curate InfoPop, the\nfirst dataset containing popularity labels for over 1.7 million sentences from\nover 50,000 online news documents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst dataset automatically created using streams of incoming search engine\nqueries to generate sentence-level popularity annotations.

Our proposed technique coupled with a BERT-based neural model\nexceeds nDCG values of 0.8 for proactive sentence-specific popularity\nforecasting.

In this paper, the concept of active\nRISs is studied to overcome this fundamental limitation. Unlike the existing\npassive RISs that reflect signals without amplification, active RISs can\namplify the reflected signals via amplifiers integrated into their elements. To\ncharacterize the signal amplification and incorporate the noise introduced by\nthe active components, we verify the signal model of active RISs through the\nexperimental measurements on a fabricated active RIS element.

The Shapley value has attracted increasing interest for\nredistribution in energy settings - however, computing it exactly is\nintractable beyond a few dozen prosumers. In this paper, we first conduct a\nsystematic review of the literature on the use of Shapley value in\nenergy-related applications, as well as efforts to compute or approximate it.\nNext, we formalise the main methods for approximating the Shapley value in\ncommunity energy settings, and propose a new one, which we call the stratified\nexpected value approximation. To compare the performance of these methods, we\ndesign a novel method for exact Shapley value computation, which can be applied\nto communities of up to several hundred agents by clustering the prosumers into\na smaller number of demand profiles. We perform a large-scale experimental\ncomparison of the proposed methods, for communities of up to 200 prosumers,\nusing large-scale, publicly available data from two large-scale energy trials\nin the UK (UKERC Energy Data Centre, 2017, UK Power Networks Innovation, 2021).\nOur analysis shows that, as the number of agents in the community increases,\nthe relative difference to the exact Shapley value converges to under 1% for\nall the approximation methods considered. In particular, for most experimental\nscenarios, we show that there is no statistical difference between the newly\nproposed stratified expected value method and the existing state-of-the-art\nmethod that uses adaptive sampling (O'Brien et al., 2015), although the cost of\ncomputation for large communities is an order of magnitude lower.",

    "title": "Cap4Video: What Can Auxiliary Captions Do for Text-Video Retrieval?",
    "abstract": "Most existing text-video retrieval methods focus on cross-modal matching\nbetween the visual content of offline videos and textual query sentences.\nHowever, in real scenarios, online videos are frequently accompanied by\nrelevant text information such as titles, tags, and even subtitles, which can\nbe utilized to match textual queries. This inspires us to generate associated\ncaptions from offline videos to help with existing text-video retrieval\nmethods. To do so, we propose to use the zero-shot video captioner with\nknowledge of pre-trained web-scale models (e.g., CLIP and GPT-2) to generate\ncaptions for offline videos without any training. Given the captions, one\nquestion naturally arises: what can auxiliary captions do for text-video\nretrieval? In this paper, we present a novel framework Cap4Video, which makes\nuse of captions from three aspects: i) Input data: The video and captions can\nform new video-caption pairs as data augmentation for training. ii) Feature\ninteraction: We perform feature interaction between video and caption to yield\nenhanced video representations. iii) Output score: The Query-Caption matching\nbranch can be complementary to the original Query-Video matching branch for\ntext-video retrieval. We conduct thorough ablation studies to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method. Without any post-processing, our Cap4Video\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on MSR-VTT (51.4%), VATEX (66.6%), MSVD\n(51.8%), and DiDeMo (52.0%).",

Accordingly, we herein present such a comprehensive review to\nexplain and summarize the challenges associated with security and privacy in\nreinforcement learning from a new perspective, namely that of the Markov\nDecision Process (MDP). In this survey, we first introduce the key concepts\nrelated to this area. Next, we cover the security and privacy issues linked to\nthe state, action, environment, and reward function of the MDP process,\nrespectively.

Approaches to extract and present these\nrepresentations, in order to explain the neural network's decisions, is an\nactive and multifaceted research field. To gain a deeper understanding of a\ncentral aspect of this field, we have performed a targeted review focusing on\nresearch that aims to associate internal representations with human\nunderstandable concepts.

We find this taxonomy and theories of causality, useful for\nunderstanding what can be expected, and not expected, from neural network\nexplanations. The analysis additionally uncovers an ambiguity in the reviewed\nliterature related to the goal of model explainability; is it understanding the\nML model or, is it actionable explanations useful in the deployment domain?",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel framework to track multiple objects in overhead camera\nvideos for airport checkpoint security scenarios where targets correspond to\npassengers and their baggage items. We propose a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)\ntechnique to provide the model information about instance segmentation\nuncertainty from overhead images. Our SSL approach improves object detection by\nemploying a test-time data augmentation and a regression-based,\nrotation-invariant pseudo-label refinement technique. Our pseudo-label\ngeneration method provides multiple geometrically-transformed images as inputs\nto a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), regresses the augmented detections\ngenerated by the network to reduce localization errors, and then clusters them\nusing the mean-shift algorithm. The self-supervised detector model is used in a\nsingle-camera tracking algorithm to generate temporal identifiers for the\ntargets. Our method also incorporates a multi-view trajectory association\nmechanism to maintain consistent temporal identifiers as passengers travel\nacross camera views. An evaluation of detection, tracking, and association\nperformances on videos obtained from multiple overhead cameras in a realistic\nairport checkpoint environment demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach. Our results show that self-supervision improves object detection\naccuracy by up to $42\\%$ without increasing the inference time of the model.\nOur multi-camera association method achieves up to $89\\%$ multi-object tracking\naccuracy with an average computation time of less than $15$ ms.",

    "abstract": "We provide a new perspective on the problem how high-level state machine\nmodels with abstract actions can be related to low-level models in which these\nactions are refined by sequences of concrete actions. We describe the\nconnection between high-level and low-level actions using action codes, a\nvariation of the prefix codes known from coding theory. For each action code\n$\\mathcal{R}$, we introduce a contraction operator $\\alpha_\\mathcal{R}$ that\nturns a low-level model $M$ into a high-level model, and a refinement operator\n$\\varrho_\\mathcal{R}$ that transforms a high-level model $N$ into a low-level\nmodel. We establish a Galois connection $\\varrho_\\mathcal{R}(N) \\sqsubseteq M\n\\Leftrightarrow N \\sqsubseteq \\alpha_\\mathcal{R}(M)$, where $\\sqsubseteq$\ndenotes the well-known simulation preorder. In practice, we typically want to\nobtain an overapproximation of model $M$. To this end, we also introduce a\nconcretization operator $\\gamma_\\mathcal{R}$. This operator behaves like the\nrefinement operator, but adds arbitrary behavior at intermediate points during\na refinement. We establish a second Galois connection $\\alpha_\\mathcal{R}(M)\n\\sqsubseteq N \\Leftrightarrow M \\sqsubseteq \\gamma_\\mathcal{R}(N)$. We show how\nan action code may be used to construct an adaptor that translates between\nconcrete and abstract inputs and outputs during learning and conformance\ntesting of a black-box system. If $M$ models a black-box system then\n$\\alpha_\\mathcal{R}(M)$ describes the behavior that can be observed by a\ntester/learner that interacts with this system via an adaptor derived from code\n$\\mathcal{R}$.

    "abstract": "Multi-fidelity Kriging model is a promising technique in surrogate-based\ndesign as it can balance the model accuracy and cost of sample preparation by\nfusing low- and high-fidelity data. However, the cost for building a\nmulti-fidelity Kriging model increases significantly with the increase of the\nproblem dimension. To attack this issue, an efficient Hierarchical Kriging\nmodeling method is proposed. In building the low-fidelity model, the maximal\ninformation coefficient is utilized to calculate the relative value of the\nhyperparameter. With this, the maximum likelihood estimation problem for\ndetermining the hyperparameters is transformed as a one-dimension optimization\nproblem, which can be solved in an efficient manner and thus improve the\nmodeling efficiency significantly. A local search is involved further to\nexploit the search space of hyperparameters to improve the model accuracy. The\nhigh-fidelity model is built in a similar manner with the hyperparameter of the\nlow-fidelity model served as the relative value of the hyperparameter for\nhigh-fidelity model. The performance of the proposed method is compared with\nthe conventional tuning strategy, by testing them over ten analytic problems\nand an engineering problem of modeling the isentropic efficiency of a\ncompressor rotor. The empirical results demonstrate that the modeling time of\nthe proposed method is reduced significantly without sacrificing the model\naccuracy. For the modeling of the isentropic efficiency of the compressor\nrotor, the cost saving associated with the proposed method is about 90%\ncompared with the conventional strategy. Meanwhile, the proposed method\nachieves higher accuracy.",

    "abstract": "There is widespread debate on whether to anonymize author identities in peer\nreview. The key argument for anonymization is to mitigate bias, whereas\narguments against anonymization posit various uses of author identities in the\nreview process. The Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS) 2023\nconference adopted a middle ground by initially anonymizing the author\nidentities from reviewers, revealing them after the reviewer had submitted\ntheir initial reviews, and allowing the reviewer to change their review\nsubsequently. We present an analysis of the reviews pertaining to the\nidentification and use of author identities. Our key findings are: (I) A\nmajority of reviewers self-report not knowing and being unable to guess the\nauthors' identities for the papers they were reviewing. (II) After the initial\nsubmission of reviews, only 7% of reviews changed their overall merit score and\n3.8% changed their self-reported reviewer expertise. (III) Even among reviews\nthat changed, there was little correlation between the change in overall merit\nand the rank of the authors' affiliations (Kendall tau b correlation\ncoefficient = 0.09). We also conducted an anonymous survey to obtain opinions\nfrom reviewers and authors. The main findings from the 200 survey responses\nare: (i) A vast majority of participants favor anonymizing author identities in\nsome form. (ii) The \"middle-ground\" initiative of ITCS 2023 was appreciated.\n(iii) Detecting conflicts of interest is a challenge that needs to be addressed\nif author identities are anonymized.

Consequently, although the LBM is usually applied to solve fluid\nflows, the above interpretation of the LBM as a general numerical tool, allows\nthe LBM to be extended to solid mechanics as well. In this spirit, the LBM has\nbeen studied in recent years. First publications [3], [4] presented an LBM\nscheme for the numerical solution of the dynamic behavior of a linear elastic\nsolid under simplified deformation assumptions. For so-called anti-plane shear\ndeformation, the only non-zero displacement component is governed by a\ntwo-dimensional wave equation. In this work, an existing LBM for the\ntwo-dimensional wave equation is extended to more general plane strain\nproblems. The proposed algorithm reduces the plane strain problem to the\nsolution of two separate wave equations for the volume dilatation and the\nnon-zero component of the rotation vector, respectively. A particular focus is\non the implementation of types of boundary conditions that are commonly\nencountered in engineering practice for solids: Dirichlet and Neumann boundary\nconditions.

To\nalleviate this issue, we introduce a conceptually simple yet learning-efficient\nMIM training scheme, termed Disjoint Masking with Joint Distillation (DMJD).\nFor disjoint masking (DM), we sequentially sample multiple masked views per\nimage in a mini-batch with the disjoint regulation to raise the usage of tokens\nfor reconstruction in each image while keeping the masking rate of each view.\nFor joint distillation (JD), we adopt a dual branch architecture to\nrespectively predict invisible (masked) and visible (unmasked) tokens with\nsuperior learning targets.

However, human pose estimation from images is adversely\naffected by occlusion and lighting, which are common in many scenarios of\ninterest.

    "title": "A Comparative Study of Image Disguising Methods for Confidential  Outsourced Learning",
    "abstract": "Large training data and expensive model tweaking are standard features of\ndeep learning for images. As a result, data owners often utilize cloud\nresources to develop large-scale complex models, which raises privacy concerns.\nExisting solutions are either too expensive to be practical or do not\nsufficiently protect the confidentiality of data and models. In this paper, we\nstudy and compare novel \\emph{image disguising} mechanisms, DisguisedNets and\nInstaHide, aiming to achieve a better trade-off among the level of protection\nfor outsourced DNN model training, the expenses, and the utility of data.\nDisguisedNets are novel combinations of image blocktization, block-level random\npermutation, and two block-level secure transformations: random\nmultidimensional projection (RMT) and AES pixel-level encryption (AES).\nInstaHide is an image mixup and random pixel flipping technique \\cite{huang20}.\nWe have analyzed and evaluated them under a multi-level threat model. RMT\nprovides a better security guarantee than InstaHide, under the Level-1\nadversarial knowledge with well-preserved model quality. In contrast, AES\nprovides a security guarantee under the Level-2 adversarial knowledge, but it\nmay affect model quality more. The unique features of image disguising also\nhelp us to protect models from model-targeted attacks. We have done an\nextensive experimental evaluation to understand how these methods work in\ndifferent settings for different datasets.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a leading cause of death worldwide, and the diagnosis of\ndepression is nontrivial. Multimodal learning is a popular solution for\nautomatic diagnosis of depression, and the existing works suffer two main\ndrawbacks: 1) the high-order interactions between different modalities can not\nbe well exploited; and 2) interpretability of the models are weak. To remedy\nthese drawbacks, we propose a multimodal multi-order factor fusion (MMFF)\nmethod. Our method can well exploit the high-order interactions between\ndifferent modalities by extracting and assembling modality factors under the\nguide of a shared latent proxy. We conduct extensive experiments on two recent\nand popular datasets, E-DAIC-WOZ and CMDC, and the results show that our method\nachieve significantly better performance compared with other existing\napproaches. Besides, by analyzing the process of factor assembly, our model can\nintuitively show the contribution of each factor. This helps us understand the\nfusion mechanism.",

Existing UDA approaches highly depend on\nthe accessibility of source domain data, which is usually limited in practical\nscenarios due to privacy protection, data storage and transmission cost, and\ncomputation burden. To tackle this issue, many source-free unsupervised domain\nadaptation (SFUDA) methods have been proposed recently, which perform knowledge\ntransfer from a pre-trained source model to unlabeled target domain with source\ndata inaccessible. A comprehensive review of these works on SFUDA is of great\nsignificance. In this paper, we provide a timely and systematic literature\nreview of existing SFUDA approaches from a technical perspective. Specifically,\nwe categorize current SFUDA studies into two groups, i.e., white-box SFUDA and\nblack-box SFUDA, and further divide them into finer subcategories based on\ndifferent learning strategies they use. We also investigate the challenges of\nmethods in each subcategory, discuss the advantages/disadvantages of white-box\nand black-box SFUDA methods, conclude the commonly used benchmark datasets, and\nsummarize the popular techniques for improved generalizability of models\nlearned without using source data.

This work proposes Network Effect Analysis (NEA) and UltraProp,\nwhich are based on two insights: (a) the network-effect (NE) insight: a graph\ncan exhibit not only one of homophily and heterophily, but also both or none in\na label-wise manner, and (b) the neighbor-differentiation (ND) insight:\nneighbors have different degrees of influence on the target node based on the\nstrength of connections. NEA provides a statistical test to check whether a\ngraph exhibits network-effect or not, and surprisingly discovers the absence of\nNE in many real-world graphs known to have heterophily. UltraProp solves the\nnode classification problem with notable advantages: (a) Accurate, thanks to\nthe network-effect (NE) and neighbor-differentiation (ND) insights; (b)\nExplainable, precisely estimating the compatibility matrix; (c) Scalable, being\nlinear with the input size and handling graphs with millions of nodes; and (d)\nPrincipled, with closed-form formula and theoretical guarantee.

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been recognized as a promising\ntechnique for the sixth generation (6G) of mobile communication networks. The\nkey feature of RIS is to reconfigure the propagation environment via smart\nsignal reflections. In addition, active RIS schemes have been recently proposed\nto overcome the deep path loss attenuation inherent in the RIS-aided\ncommunication systems. Accordingly, this paper considers the secrecy\nperformance of up-link RIS-aided multiple users multiple-input single-output\n(MU-MISO) communication systems, in the presence of multiple passive\neavesdroppers. In contrast to the existing works, we investigate the impact of\nthe RIS phase shift errors on the secrecy performance. Taking into account the\ncomplex environment, where a general Rician channel model is adopted for all\nthe communication links, closed-form approximate expressions for the ergodic\nsecrecy rate are derived for three RIS configurations, namely, i) passive RIS,\nii) active RIS, iii) active RIS with energy harvesting (EH RIS). Then, based on\nthe derived expressions, we optimize the phase shifts at the RIS to enhance the\nsystem performance. In addition, the best RIS configuration selection is\nconsidered for a given target secrecy rate and amount of the power available at\nthe users. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulations are provided to verify the accuracy\nof the analysis, and the impact of different system parameters on the secrecy\nperformance is investigated. The results in this paper show that, an active RIS\nscheme can be implemented to enhance the secrecy performance of RIS-aided\ncommunication systems with phase shift errors, especially when the users have\nlimited transmission power.",

The first set of results of this\nwork characterize the convergence of the network's gradient descent dynamics.\nSurprisingly, it is shown that the network after sparsification can achieve as\nfast convergence as the original network. The contribution over previous work\nis that not only the bias is allowed to be updated by gradient descent under\nour setting but also a finer analysis is given such that the required width to\nensure the network's closeness to its NTK is improved. Secondly, the networks'\ngeneralization bound after training is provided. A width-sparsity dependence is\npresented which yields sparsity-dependent localized Rademacher complexity and a\ngeneralization bound matching previous analysis (up to logarithmic factors). As\na by-product, if the bias initialization is chosen to be zero, the width\nrequirement improves the previous bound for the shallow networks'\ngeneralization. Lastly, since the generalization bound has dependence on the\nsmallest eigenvalue of the limiting NTK and the bounds from previous works\nyield vacuous generalization, this work further studies the least eigenvalue of\nthe limiting NTK. Surprisingly, while it is not shown that trainable biases are\nnecessary, trainable bias helps to identify a nice data-dependent region where\na much finer analysis of the NTK's smallest eigenvalue can be conducted, which\nleads to a much sharper lower bound than the previously known worst-case bound\nand, consequently, a non-vacuous generalization bound.",

The\nproblem stems from the large number of operations (e.g., floating point\nmultiplications and additions) and memory consumption required during training\nby the back-propagation algorithm. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a\nnew gradient filtering approach which enables on-device DNN model training.\nMore precisely, our approach creates a special structure with fewer unique\nelements in the gradient map, thus significantly reducing the computational\ncomplexity and memory consumption of back propagation during training.\nExtensive experiments on image classification and semantic segmentation with\nmultiple DNN models (e.g., MobileNet, DeepLabV3, UPerNet) and devices (e.g.,\nRaspberry Pi and Jetson Nano) demonstrate the effectiveness and wide\napplicability of our approach.

Finally, our method is easy to implement and deploy;\nover 20$\\times$ speedup and 90% energy savings have been observed compared to\nhighly optimized baselines in MKLDNN and CUDNN on NVIDIA Jetson Nano.\nConsequently, our approach opens up a new direction of research with a huge\npotential for on-device training.",

    "abstract": "It has been observed in practice that applying pruning-at-initialization\nmethods to neural networks and training the sparsified networks can not only\nretain the testing performance of the original dense models, but also sometimes\neven slightly boost the generalization performance. Theoretical understanding\nfor such experimental observations are yet to be developed. This work makes the\nfirst attempt to study how different pruning fractions affect the model's\ngradient descent dynamics and generalization. Specifically, this work considers\na classification task for overparameterized two-layer neural networks, where\nthe network is randomly pruned according to different rates at the\ninitialization. It is shown that as long as the pruning fraction is below a\ncertain threshold, gradient descent can drive the training loss toward zero and\nthe network exhibits good generalization performance. More surprisingly, the\ngeneralization bound gets better as the pruning fraction gets larger. To\ncomplement this positive result, this work further shows a negative result:\nthere exists a large pruning fraction such that while gradient descent is still\nable to drive the training loss toward zero (by memorizing noise), the\ngeneralization performance is no better than random guessing. This further\nsuggests that pruning can change the feature learning process, which leads to\nthe performance drop of the pruned neural network.

A separable robot which overcomes\ndifficulties in actuation and sterilization is introduced, in which the body\ncontaining the electronics is reusable and the remainder is disposable. A\ncontrol input which resolves the redundancy in the kinematics and a physical\ninterpretation of this redundancy are provided. The effect of a static change\nin the proximal section angle on bending angle error was explored under four\ntesting conditions for a sinusoidal input. Bending angle error increased for\nincreasing proximal section angle for all testing conditions with an average\nerror reduction of 41.48% for retension, 4.28% for hysteresis, and 52.35% for\nre-tension + hysteresis compensation relative to the baseline case. Two major\nsources of error in tracking the bending angle were identified: time delay from\nhysteresis and DC offset from the proximal section angle. Examination of these\nerror sources revealed that the simple hysteresis compensation was most\neffective for removing time delay and re-tension compensation for removing DC\noffset, which was the primary source of increasing error. The re-tension\ncompensation was also tested for dynamic changes in the proximal section and\nreduced error in the final configuration of the tip by 89.14% relative to the\nbaseline case.",

Fortunately, as the transaction records stored in the Ethereum\nblockchain are publicly accessible, we can understand the behavior of accounts\nor detect illicit activities via transaction mining. Existing risk control\ntechniques have primarily been developed from the perspectives of\nde-anonymizing address clustering and illicit account classification.

We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of RiskProp in overcoming the limitations of\nexisting models by conducting experiments on real-world datasets from Ethereum.\nThrough case studies on the detected high-risk accounts, we demonstrate that\nthe risk assessment by RiskProp can be used to provide warnings for investors\nand protect them from possible financial losses, and the superior performance\nof risk score-based account classification experiments further verifies the\neffectiveness of our rating method.",

    "abstract": "Despite some successful applications of goal-driven navigation, existing deep\nreinforcement learning-based approaches notoriously suffers from poor data\nefficiency issue. One of the reasons is that the goal information is decoupled\nfrom the perception module and directly introduced as a condition of\ndecision-making, resulting in the goal-irrelevant features of the scene\nrepresentation playing an adversary role during the learning process. In light\nof this, we present a novel Goal-guided Transformer-enabled reinforcement\nlearning (GTRL) approach by considering the physical goal states as an input of\nthe scene encoder for guiding the scene representation to couple with the goal\ninformation and realizing efficient autonomous navigation. More specifically,\nwe propose a novel variant of the Vision Transformer as the backbone of the\nperception system, namely Goal-guided Transformer (GoT), and pre-train it with\nexpert priors to boost the data efficiency. Subsequently, a reinforcement\nlearning algorithm is instantiated for the decision-making system, taking the\ngoal-oriented scene representation from the GoT as the input and generating\ndecision commands. As a result, our approach motivates the scene representation\nto concentrate mainly on goal-relevant features, which substantially enhances\nthe data efficiency of the DRL learning process, leading to superior navigation\nperformance. Both simulation and real-world experimental results manifest the\nsuperiority of our approach in terms of data efficiency, performance,\nrobustness, and sim-to-real generalization, compared with other state-of-art\nbaselines.

    "title": "Mapping smallholder cashew plantations to inform sustainable tree crop  expansion in Benin",
    "abstract": "Cashews are grown by over 3 million smallholders in more than 40 countries\nworldwide as a principal source of income. As the third largest cashew producer\nin Africa, Benin has nearly 200,000 smallholder cashew growers contributing 15%\nof the country's national export earnings. However, a lack of information on\nwhere and how cashew trees grow across the country hinders decision-making that\ncould support increased cashew production and poverty alleviation. By\nleveraging 2.4-m Planet Basemaps and 0.5-m aerial imagery, newly developed deep\nlearning algorithms, and large-scale ground truth datasets, we successfully\nproduced the first national map of cashew in Benin and characterized the\nexpansion of cashew plantations between 2015 and 2021. In particular, we\ndeveloped a SpatioTemporal Classification with Attention (STCA) model to map\nthe distribution of cashew plantations, which can fully capture texture\ninformation from discriminative time steps during a growing season. We further\ndeveloped a Clustering Augmented Self-supervised Temporal Classification\n(CASTC) model to distinguish high-density versus low-density cashew plantations\nby automatic feature extraction and optimized clustering. Results show that the\nSTCA model has an overall accuracy of 80% and the CASTC model achieved an\noverall accuracy of 77.9%. We found that the cashew area in Benin has doubled\nfrom 2015 to 2021 with 60% of new plantation development coming from cropland\nor fallow land, while encroachment of cashew plantations into protected areas\nhas increased by 70%. Only half of cashew plantations were high-density in\n2021, suggesting high potential for intensification. Our study illustrates the\npower of combining high-resolution remote sensing imagery and state-of-the-art\ndeep learning algorithms to better understand tree crops in the heterogeneous\nsmallholder landscape.",

Due to the limited\nfeedback information, existing query-based black-box attack methods often\nrequire many queries for attacking each benign example. To reduce query cost,\nwe propose to utilize the feedback information across historical attacks,\ndubbed example-level adversarial transferability. Specifically, by treating the\nattack on each benign example as one task, we develop a meta-learning framework\nby training a meta-generator to produce perturbations conditioned on benign\nexamples. When attacking a new benign example, the meta generator can be\nquickly fine-tuned based on the feedback information of the new task as well as\na few historical attacks to produce effective perturbations. Moreover, since\nthe meta-train procedure consumes many queries to learn a generalizable\ngenerator, we utilize model-level adversarial transferability to train the\nmeta-generator on a white-box surrogate model, then transfer it to help the\nattack against the target model. The proposed framework with the two types of\nadversarial transferability can be naturally combined with any off-the-shelf\nquery-based attack methods to boost their performance, which is verified by\nextensive experiments.",

    "abstract": "Domain adaptive detection aims to improve the generalization of detectors on\ntarget domain. To reduce discrepancy in feature distributions between two\ndomains, recent approaches achieve domain adaption through feature alignment in\ndifferent granularities via adversarial learning. However, they neglect the\nrelationship between multiple granularities and different features in\nalignment, degrading detection. Addressing this, we introduce a unified\nmulti-granularity alignment (MGA)-based detection framework for\ndomain-invariant feature learning. The key is to encode the dependencies across\ndifferent granularities including pixel-, instance-, and category-levels\nsimultaneously to align two domains. Specifically, based on pixel-level\nfeatures, we first develop an omni-scale gated fusion (OSGF) module to\naggregate discriminative representations of instances with scale-aware\nconvolutions, leading to robust multi-scale detection. Besides, we introduce\nmulti-granularity discriminators to identify where, either source or target\ndomains, different granularities of samples come from. Note that, MGA not only\nleverages instance discriminability in different categories but also exploits\ncategory consistency between two domains for detection. Furthermore, we present\nan adaptive exponential moving average (AEMA) strategy that explores model\nassessments for model update to improve pseudo labels and alleviate local\nmisalignment problem, boosting detection robustness. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple domain adaption scenarios validate the superiority of MGA over other\napproaches on FCOS and Faster R-CNN detectors.

    "abstract": "Domain adaptation methods reduce domain shift typically by learning\ndomain-invariant features. Most existing methods are built on distribution\nmatching, e.g., adversarial domain adaptation, which tends to corrupt feature\ndiscriminability. In this paper, we propose Discriminative Radial Domain\nAdaptation (DRDR) which bridges source and target domains via a shared radial\nstructure. It's motivated by the observation that as the model is trained to be\nprogressively discriminative, features of different categories expand outwards\nin different directions, forming a radial structure. We show that transferring\nsuch an inherently discriminative structure would enable to enhance feature\ntransferability and discriminability simultaneously. Specifically, we represent\neach domain with a global anchor and each category a local anchor to form a\nradial structure and reduce domain shift via structure matching. It consists of\ntwo parts, namely isometric transformation to align the structure globally and\nlocal refinement to match each category. To enhance the discriminability of the\nstructure, we further encourage samples to cluster close to the corresponding\nlocal anchors based on optimal-transport assignment. Extensively experimenting\non multiple benchmarks, our method is shown to consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches on varied tasks, including the typical unsupervised\ndomain adaptation, multi-source domain adaptation, domain-agnostic learning,\nand domain generalization.",

    "title": "Inflected Forms Are Redundant in Question Generation Models",
    "abstract": "Neural models with an encoder-decoder framework provide a feasible solution\nto Question Generation (QG). However, after analyzing the model vocabulary we\nfind that current models (both RNN-based and pre-training based) have more than\n23\\% inflected forms. As a result, the encoder will generate separate\nembeddings for the inflected forms, leading to a waste of training data and\nparameters. Even worse, in decoding these models are vulnerable to irrelevant\nnoise and they suffer from high computational costs. In this paper, we propose\nan approach to enhance the performance of QG by fusing word transformation.\nFirstly, we identify the inflected forms of words from the input of encoder,\nand replace them with the root words, letting the encoder pay more attention to\nthe repetitive root words. Secondly, we propose to adapt QG as a combination of\nthe following actions in the encode-decoder framework: generating a question\nword, copying a word from the source sequence or generating a word\ntransformation type. Such extension can greatly decrease the size of predicted\nwords in the decoder as well as noise. We apply our approach to a typical\nRNN-based model and \\textsc{UniLM} to get the improved versions. We conduct\nextensive experiments on SQuAD and MS MARCO datasets. The experimental results\nshow that the improved versions can significantly outperform the corresponding\nbaselines in terms of BLEU, ROUGE-L and METEOR as well as time cost.",

Most previous attacks assumed that the wild images are\nlabeled. In reality, however, most images on the web are unlabeled.\nSpecifically, we study the effects of unlabeled backdoor images under\nsemi-supervised learning (SSL) on widely studied deep neural networks. To be\nrealistic, we assume that the adversary is zero-knowledge and that the\nsemi-supervised learning model is trained from scratch. Firstly, we find the\nfact that backdoor poisoning always fails when poisoned unlabeled images come\nfrom different classes, which is different from poisoning the labeled images.\nThe reason is that the SSL algorithms always strive to correct them during\ntraining. Therefore, for unlabeled images, we implement backdoor poisoning on\nimages from the target class. Then, we propose a gradient matching strategy to\ncraft poisoned images such that their gradients match the gradients of target\nimages on the SSL model, which can fit poisoned images to the target class and\nrealize backdoor injection. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first\napproach to backdoor poisoning on unlabeled images of trained-from-scratch SSL\nmodels.

    "title": "An Overview of Limitations and Approaches in Identity Management",
    "abstract": "Identity and access management (I&AM) is the umbrella term for managing users\nand their permissions. It is required for users to access different services.\nThese services can either be provided from their home organization, like a\ncompany or university, or from external service providers, e.g., cooperation\npartners. I&AM provides the management of identifiers with the attributes,\ncredentials, roles, and permissions the user has. Today, the requirements have\nevolved from simply accessing individual web services in the internet or at a\ncompany to the majority of all IT services from different service providers\nwith various accounts. Several identity management models have been created\nwith different approaches within.\nIn order to adjust to heterogeneous environments, use cases, and the\nevolution of identity management, this paper extends known requirements for\nidentity management. Existing models and approaches for identity management are\nmapped to the derived requirements. Based on the mapping, advantages,\ndisadvantages, and gaps are identified. Current approaches suffer, as an\nexample, from trustworthiness and liability issues. Interoperability issues are\neven more inherent as the approaches partly develop apart, forming an\nheterogeneous environment. The results from this analysis emphasize the need\nfor one holistic identity management framework.",

    "abstract": "Identity management refers to the technology and policies for the\nidentification, authentication, and authorization of users in computer\nnetworks. Identity management is therefore fundamental to today's IT ecosystem.\nAt the same time, identity management systems, where digital identities are\nmanaged, pose an attractive target for attacks. With the heterogeneity of\nidentity management systems, every type (i.e., models, protocols,\nimplementations) has different requirements, typical problems, and hence attack\nvectors. In order to provide a systematic and categorized overview, the\nframework Taxonomy for Identity Management Attacks (TaxIdMA) for attacks\nrelated to identities is proposed. The purpose of this framework is to classify\nexisting attacks associated with system identities, identity management\nsystems, and end-user identities as well as the background using an extensible\nstructure from a scientific perspective. The taxonomy is then evaluated with\neight real-world attacks resp. vulnerabilities. This analysis shows the\ncapability of the proposed taxonomy framework TaxIdMA in describing and\ncategorizing these attacks.",

    "abstract": "Surgical robot automation has attracted increasing research interest over the\npast decade, expecting its huge potential to benefit surgeons, nurses and\npatients. Recently, the learning paradigm of embodied AI has demonstrated\npromising ability to learn good control policies for various complex tasks,\nwhere embodied AI simulators play an essential role to facilitate relevant\nresearchers. However, existing open-sourced simulators for surgical robot are\nstill not sufficiently supporting human interactions through physical input\ndevices, which further limits effective investigations on how human\ndemonstrations would affect policy learning. In this paper, we study\nhuman-in-the-loop embodied intelligence with a new interactive simulation\nplatform for surgical robot learning. Specifically, we establish our platform\nbased on our previously released SurRoL simulator with several new features\nco-developed to allow high-quality human interaction via an input device. With\nthese, we further propose to collect human demonstrations and imitate the\naction patterns to achieve more effective policy learning. We showcase the\nimprovement of our simulation environment with the designed new features and\ntasks, and validate state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms using\nthe interactive environment. Promising results are obtained, with which we hope\nto pave the way for future research on surgical embodied intelligence.

    "abstract": "Although the effects of the social norm on mitigating misinformation are\nidentified, scant knowledge exists about the patterns of social norm emergence,\nsuch as the patterns and variations of social tipping in online communities\nwith diverse characteristics. Accordingly, this study investigates the features\nof social tipping in online communities and examines the correlations between\nthe tipping features and characteristics of online communities. Taking the side\neffects of COVID-19 vaccination as the case topic, we first track the patterns\nof tipping features in 100 online communities, which are detected using Louvain\nAlgorithm from the aggregated communication network on Twitter between May 2020\nand April 2021. Then, we use multi-variant linear regression to explore the\ncorrelations between tipping features and community characteristics. We find\nthat social tipping in online communities can sustain for two to four months\nand lead to a 50% increase in populations who accept the normative belief in\nonline communities. The regression indicates that the duration of social\ntipping is positively related to the community populations and original\nacceptance of social norms, while the correlation between the tipping duration\nand the degrees among community members is negative. Additionally, the network\nmodularity and original acceptance of social norms have negative relationships\nwith the extent of social tipping, while the degree and betweenness centrality\ncan have significant positive relationships with the extent of tipping. Our\nfindings shed light on more precise normative interventions on misinformation\nin digital environments as it offers preliminary evidence about the timing and\nmechanism of social norm emergence.",

    "title": "Waveforms for xG Non-stationary Channels",
    "abstract": "Waveform design aims to achieve orthogonality among data signals/symbols\nacross all available Degrees of Freedom (DoF) to avoid interference while\ntransmitted over the channel. In general, precoding decomposes the channel\nmatrix into desirable components in order to construct a precoding matrix,\nwhich is combined with the data signal to orthogonality in the spatial\ndimension. On the other hand, modulation uses orthogonal carriers in a certain\nsignal space to carry data symbols with minimal interference from other\nsymbols. However, it is widely evident that next Generation (xG) wireless\nsystems will experience very high mobility, density and time-varying multi-path\npropagation that will result in a highly non-stationarity of the channel\nstates. Conventional precoding methods using SVD or QR decomposition, are\nunable to capture these joint spatio-temporal variations as those techniques\ntreat the space-time-varying channel as separate independent spatial channel\nmatrices and hence fail to achieve joint spatio-temporal orthogonality.\nMeanwhile, the carriers in OFDM and OTFS modulations are unable to maintain the\northogonality in the frequency and delay-Doppler domain respectively, due to\nthe higher order physical variation like velocity (Doppler effect) or\nacceleration (time-varying Doppler effect). In this article, we review a recent\nmethod called High Order Generalized Mercer's Theorem (HOGMT) for orthogonal\ndecomposition of higher dimensional, non-stationary channels and its\napplication to MU-MIMO precoding and modulation. We conclude by identifying\nsome practical challenges and the future directions for waveform design for\nMU-MIMO non-stationary channels based on HOGMT.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised learning-based anomaly detection in latent space has gained\nimportance since discriminating anomalies from normal data becomes difficult in\nhigh-dimensional space. Both density estimation and distance-based methods to\ndetect anomalies in latent space have been explored in the past. These methods\nprove that retaining valuable properties of input data in latent space helps in\nthe better reconstruction of test data. Moreover, real-world sensor data is\nskewed and non-Gaussian in nature, making mean-based estimators unreliable for\nskewed data. Again, anomaly detection methods based on reconstruction error\nrely on Euclidean distance, which does not consider useful correlation\ninformation in the feature space and also fails to accurately reconstruct the\ndata when it deviates from the training distribution. In this work, we address\nthe limitations of reconstruction error-based autoencoders and propose a\nkernelized autoencoder that leverages a robust form of Mahalanobis distance\n(MD) to measure latent dimension correlation to effectively detect both near\nand far anomalies. This hybrid loss is aided by the principle of maximizing the\nmutual information gain between the latent dimension and the high-dimensional\nprior data space by maximizing the entropy of the latent space while preserving\nuseful correlation information of the original data in the low-dimensional\nlatent space. The multi-objective function has two goals -- it measures\ncorrelation information in the latent feature space in the form of robust MD\ndistance and simultaneously tries to preserve useful correlation information\nfrom the original data space in the latent space by maximizing mutual\ninformation between the prior and latent space.",

However, systematic studies on the design principle of\nBlockchain as a trust engine for an integrated society of\nCyber-Physical-Socia-System (CPSS) are still absent. In this article, we\nprovide an initiative for seeking the design principle of Blockchain for a\nbetter digital world. Using a hybrid method of qualitative and quantitative\nstudies, we examine the past origin, the current development, and the future\ndirections of Blockchain design principles. We have three findings. First, the\nanswers to whether Blockchain lives up to its original design principle as a\ndistributed database are controversial. Second, the current development of\nBlockchain community reveals a taxonomy of 7 categories, including privacy and\nsecurity, scalability, decentralization, applicability, governance and\nregulation, system design, and cross-chain interoperability. Both research and\npractice are more centered around the first category of privacy and security\nand the fourth category of applicability. Future scholars, practitioners, and\npolicy-makers have vast opportunities in other, much less exploited facets and\nthe synthesis at the interface of multiple aspects.

    "abstract": "Industry 4.0 operates based on IoT devices, sensors, and actuators,\ntransforming the use of computing resources and software solutions in diverse\nsectors. Various Industry 4.0 latency-sensitive applications function based on\nmachine learning to process sensor data for automation and other industrial\nactivities. Sending sensor data to cloud systems is time consuming and\ndetrimental to the latency constraints of the applications, thus, fog computing\nis often deployed. Executing these applications across heterogeneous fog\nsystems demonstrates stochastic execution time behavior that affects the task\ncompletion time. We investigate and model various Industry 4.0 ML-based\napplications' stochastic executions and analyze them. Industries like oil and\ngas are prone to disasters requiring coordination of various latency-sensitive\nactivities. Hence, fog computing resources can get oversubscribed due to the\nsurge in the computing demands during a disaster. We propose federating nearby\nfog computing systems and forming a fog federation to make remote Industry 4.0\nsites resilient against the surge in computing demands. We propose a\nstatistical resource allocation method across fog federation for\nlatency-sensitive tasks. Many of the modern Industry 4.0 applications operate\nbased on a workflow of micro-services that are used alone within an industrial\nsite. As such, industry 4.0 solutions need to be aware of applications'\narchitecture, particularly monolithic vs. micro-service. Therefore, we propose\na probability-based resource allocation method that can partition micro-service\nworkflows across fog federation to meet their latency constraints. Another\nconcern in Industry 4.0 is the data privacy of the federated fog. As such, we\npropose a solution based on federated learning to train industrial ML\napplications across federated fog systems without compromising the data\nconfidentiality.",

Thus, Alice and Bob can use the position of the occupied bin within a\nframe to generate random key bits, as in PPM modulation. Because of\nentanglement, their occupied bins and their keys should be identical. However,\npractical photon detectors suffer from time jitter errors. These errors cause\ndiscrepancies between Alice's and Bob's keys. Alice sends information to Bob\nthrough the public channel to reconcile the keys.

To accurately depict performance and inspire an end-to-end design\nfor futuristic BCI designs, a more thorough examination and definition of ITR\nis therefore required. We model the symbiotic communication medium, hosted by\nthe retinogeniculate visual pathway, as a discrete memoryless channel and use\nthe modified capacity expressions to redefine the ITR.

Such heterogeneity in client class sets poses a new challenge:\nhow to ensure different clients are operating in the same latent space so as to\navoid the drift after aggregation? We observe that the classes can be described\nin natural languages (i.e., class names) and these names are typically safe to\nshare with all parties. Thus, we formulate the classification problem as a\nmatching process between data representations and class representations and\nbreak the classification model into a data encoder and a label encoder. We\nleverage the natural-language class names as the common ground to anchor the\nclass representations in the label encoder. In each iteration, the label\nencoder updates the class representations and regulates the data\nrepresentations through matching. We further use the updated class\nrepresentations at each round to annotate data samples for locally-unaware\nclasses according to similarity and distill knowledge to local models.\nExtensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that the proposed method\ncan outperform various classical and state-of-the-art federated learning\nmethods designed for learning with non-IID data.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of software requirement specifications (SRS) using Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) methods has been an important study area in the\nsoftware engineering field in recent years. Especially thanks to the advances\nbrought by deep learning and transfer learning approaches in NLP, SRS data can\nbe utilized for various learning tasks more easily. In this study, we employ a\nthree-stage domain-adaptive fine-tuning approach for three prediction tasks\nregarding software requirements, which improve the model robustness on a real\ndistribution shift. The multi-class classification tasks involve predicting the\ntype, priority and severity of the requirement texts specified by the users. We\ncompare our results with strong classification baselines such as word embedding\npooling and Sentence BERT, and show that the adaptive fine-tuning leads to\nperformance improvements across the tasks. We find that an adaptively\nfine-tuned model can be specialized to particular data distribution, which is\nable to generate accurate results and learns from abundantly available textual\ndata in software engineering task management systems.",

In this paper, we enable projection-free online learning within the\nframework of Online Convex Optimization with Memory (OCO-M) -- OCO-M captures\nhow the history of decisions affects the current outcome by allowing the online\nlearning loss functions to depend on both current and past decisions.\nParticularly, we introduce the first projection-free meta-base learning\nalgorithm with memory that minimizes dynamic regret, i.e., that minimizes the\nsuboptimality against any sequence of time-varying decisions. We are motivated\nby artificial intelligence applications where autonomous agents need to adapt\nto time-varying environments in real-time, accounting for how past decisions\naffect the present. Examples of such applications are: online control of\ndynamical systems; statistical arbitrage; and time series prediction. The\nalgorithm builds on the Online Frank-Wolfe (OFW) and Hedge algorithms. We\ndemonstrate how our algorithm can be applied to the online control of linear\ntime-varying systems in the presence of unpredictable process noise. To this\nend, we develop the first controller with memory and bounded dynamic regret\nagainst any optimal time-varying linear feedback control policy.

PokAR aims to alleviate three difficulties of traditional poker by\nleveraging AR technology: (1) need to have physical poker chips, (2) complex\nrules of poker, (3) slow game pace caused by laborious tasks. Despite the\npotential benefits of AR in poker, not much research has been done in the\nfield. In fact, PokAR is the first application to enable AR poker on a mobile\ndevice without requiring extra costly equipment. This has been done by creating\na Snapchat Lens which can be used on most mobile devices. We evaluated this\napplication by instructing 4 participant dyads to use PokAR to engage in poker\nplay and respond to survey questions about their experience. We found that most\nPokAR features were positively received, AR did not significantly improve nor\nhinder socialization, PokAR slightly increased the game pace, and participants\nhad an overall enjoyable experience with the Lens. These findings led to three\nmajor conclusions: (1) AR has the potential to augment and simplify traditional\ntable games, (2) AR should not be used to replace traditional experiences, only\naugment them, (3) Future work includes additional features like increased\ntactility and statistical annotations.",

    "abstract": "The widespread code reuse allows vulnerabilities to proliferate among a vast\nvariety of firmware. There is an urgent need to detect these vulnerable code\neffectively and efficiently. By measuring code similarities, AI-based binary\ncode similarity detection is applied to detecting vulnerable code at scale.\nExisting studies have proposed various function features to capture the\ncommonality for similarity detection. Nevertheless, the significant code\nsyntactic variability induced by the diversity of IoT hardware architectures\ndiminishes the accuracy of binary code similarity detection. In our earlier\nstudy and the tool Asteria, we adopt a Tree-LSTM network to summarize function\nsemantics as function commonality and the evaluation result indicates an\nadvanced performance. However, it still has utility concerns due to excessive\ntime costs and inadequate precision while searching for large-scale firmware\nbugs.\nTo this end, we propose a novel deep learning enhancement architecture by\nincorporating domain knowledge-based pre-filtration and re-ranking modules, and\nwe develop a prototype based on Asteria called Asteria-Pro. Pre-filtration\nmodule seeks to eliminates dissimilar functions to boost subsequent deep\nlearning model calculations, while re-ranking module aims to raises the\nrankings of vulnerable functions among candidates generated by deep learning\nmodel. Our evaluation indicates that pre-filtration module cuts the calculation\ntime by 96.9% and re-ranking improves MRR and Recall by 23.71% and 36.4%. By\nincorporating the pre-filtration and re-ranking modules, Asteria-Pro\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in bug search task, by a\nsignificant large margin.

    "abstract": "Drug dosing is an important application of AI, which can be formulated as a\nReinforcement Learning (RL) problem. In this paper, we identify two major\nchallenges of using RL for drug dosing: delayed and prolonged effects of\nadministering medications, which break the Markov assumption of the RL\nframework. We focus on prolongedness and define PAE-POMDP (Prolonged Action\nEffect-Partially Observable Markov Decision Process), a subclass of POMDPs in\nwhich the Markov assumption does not hold specifically due to prolonged effects\nof actions. Motivated by the pharmacology literature, we propose a simple and\neffective approach to converting drug dosing PAE-POMDPs into MDPs, enabling the\nuse of the existing RL algorithms to solve such problems. We validate the\nproposed approach on a toy task, and a challenging glucose control task, for\nwhich we devise a clinically-inspired reward function. Our results demonstrate\nthat: (1) the proposed method to restore the Markov assumption leads to\nsignificant improvements over a vanilla baseline; (2) the approach is\ncompetitive with recurrent policies which may inherently capture the prolonged\neffect of actions; (3) it is remarkably more time and memory efficient than the\nrecurrent baseline and hence more suitable for real-time dosing control\nsystems; and (4) it exhibits favorable qualitative behavior in our policy\nanalysis.",

    "abstract": "Temporal sentence grounding (TSG) aims to identify the temporal boundary of a\nspecific segment from an untrimmed video by a sentence query. All existing\nworks first utilize a sparse sampling strategy to extract a fixed number of\nvideo frames and then conduct multi-modal interactions with query sentence for\nreasoning. However, we argue that these methods have overlooked two\nindispensable issues: 1) Boundary-bias: The annotated target segment generally\nrefers to two specific frames as corresponding start and end timestamps. The\nvideo downsampling process may lose these two frames and take the adjacent\nirrelevant frames as new boundaries. 2) Reasoning-bias: Such incorrect new\nboundary frames also lead to the reasoning bias during frame-query interaction,\nreducing the generalization ability of model. To alleviate above limitations,\nin this paper, we propose a novel Siamese Sampling and Reasoning Network (SSRN)\nfor TSG, which introduces a siamese sampling mechanism to generate additional\ncontextual frames to enrich and refine the new boundaries. Specifically, a\nreasoning strategy is developed to learn the inter-relationship among these\nframes and generate soft labels on boundaries for more accurate frame-query\nreasoning. Such mechanism is also able to supplement the absent consecutive\nvisual semantics to the sampled sparse frames for fine-grained activity\nunderstanding.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the Transformer architecture has shown its superiority in\nthe video-based person re-identification task. Inspired by video representation\nlearning, these methods mainly focus on designing modules to extract\ninformative spatial and temporal features. However, they are still limited in\nextracting local attributes and global identity information, which are critical\nfor the person re-identification task. In this paper, we propose a novel\nMulti-Stage Spatial-Temporal Aggregation Transformer (MSTAT) with two novel\ndesigned proxy embedding modules to address the above issue. Specifically,\nMSTAT consists of three stages to encode the attribute-associated, the\nidentity-associated, and the attribute-identity-associated information from the\nvideo clips, respectively, achieving the holistic perception of the input\nperson. We combine the outputs of all the stages for the final identification.\nIn practice, to save the computational cost, the Spatial-Temporal Aggregation\n(STA) modules are first adopted in each stage to conduct the self-attention\noperations along the spatial and temporal dimensions separately. We further\nintroduce the Attribute-Aware and Identity-Aware Proxy embedding modules (AAP\nand IAP) to extract the informative and discriminative feature representations\nat different stages. All of them are realized by employing newly designed\nself-attention operations with specific meanings. Moreover, temporal patch\nshuffling is also introduced to further improve the robustness of the model.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmodules in extracting the informative and discriminative information from the\nvideos, and illustrate the MSTAT can achieve state-of-the-art accuracies on\nvarious standard benchmarks.",

Among various NLP\nmethods, Statistical Machine Translation(SMT). SMT uses probabilistic and\nstatistical techniques to analyze information and conversion. This paper\ncanvasses about the development of bilingual SMT models for translating English\nto fifteen low-resource Indian Languages (ILs) and vice versa. At the outset,\nall 15 languages are briefed with a short description related to our\nexperimental need. Further, a detailed analysis of Samanantar and OPUS dataset\nfor model building, along with standard benchmark dataset (Flores-200) for\nfine-tuning and testing, is done as a part of our experiment. Different\npreprocessing approaches are proposed in this paper to handle the noise of the\ndataset. To create the system, MOSES open-source SMT toolkit is explored.\nDistance reordering is utilized with the aim to understand the rules of grammar\nand context-dependent adjustments through a phrase reordering categorization\nframework. In our experiment, the quality of the translation is evaluated using\nstandard metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and RIBES",

    "abstract": "A noisy training set usually leads to the degradation of the generalization\nand robustness of neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel\ntheoretically guaranteed clean sample selection framework for learning with\nnoisy labels. Specifically, we first present a Scalable Penalized Regression\n(SPR) method, to model the linear relation between network features and one-hot\nlabels. In SPR, the clean data are identified by the zero mean-shift parameters\nsolved in the regression model. We theoretically show that SPR can recover\nclean data under some conditions. Under general scenarios, the conditions may\nbe no longer satisfied; and some noisy data are falsely selected as clean data.\nTo solve this problem, we propose a data-adaptive method for Scalable Penalized\nRegression with Knockoff filters (Knockoffs-SPR), which is provable to control\nthe False-Selection-Rate (FSR) in the selected clean data. To improve the\nefficiency, we further present a split algorithm that divides the whole\ntraining set into small pieces that can be solved in parallel to make the\nframework scalable to large datasets. While Knockoffs-SPR can be regarded as a\nsample selection module for a standard supervised training pipeline, we further\ncombine it with a semi-supervised algorithm to exploit the support of noisy\ndata as unlabeled data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets and\nreal-world noisy datasets show the effectiveness of our framework and validate\nthe theoretical results of Knockoffs-SPR. Our code and pre-trained models will\nbe released.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the informative structures of scenes is essential for low-level\nvision tasks. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain a concrete visual\ndefinition of the informative structures because influences of visual features\nare task-specific. In this paper, we propose a single general neural network\narchitecture for extracting task-specific structure guidance for scenes. To do\nthis, we first analyze traditional spectral clustering methods, which computes\na set of eigenvectors to model a segmented graph forming small compact\nstructures on image domains. We then unfold the traditional graph-partitioning\nproblem into a learnable network, named \\textit{Scene Structure Guidance\nNetwork (SSGNet)}, to represent the task-specific informative structures. The\nSSGNet yields a set of coefficients of eigenvectors that produces explicit\nfeature representations of image structures. In addition, our SSGNet is\nlight-weight ($\\sim$ 55K parameters), and can be used as a plug-and-play module\nfor off-the-shelf architectures. We optimize the SSGNet without any supervision\nby proposing two novel training losses that enforce task-specific scene\nstructure generation during training. Our main contribution is to show that\nsuch a simple network can achieve state-of-the-art results for several\nlow-level vision applications including joint upsampling and image denoising.\nWe also demonstrate that our SSGNet generalizes well on unseen datasets,\ncompared to existing methods which use structural embedding frameworks.

In this paper, we propose and compare the\nperformances of min-max fairness and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction-based\nx-haul and DU-CU resource allocation mechanisms to create a multi-tenant O-RAN\necosystem that is sustainable for small, medium, and large MNOs. The min-max\nfair approach minimizes the maximum OPEX of RUs through cost-sharing\nproportional to their demands, whereas the VCG auction-based approach minimizes\nthe total OPEX for all resources utilized while extracting truthful demands\nfrom RUs. We consider time-wavelength division multiplexed (TWDM) passive\noptical network (PON)-based x-haul interfaces where PON virtualization\ntechnique is used to flexibly provide optical connections among RUs and\nedge-clouds at macro-cell RU locations as well as open-clouds at the central\noffice locations.

A challenging task in train operation is to avoid skidding and\nsliding during fast changes of traction conditions, which can, for example,\noccur due to changing weather conditions, crossings, tunnels or forest entries.\nThe latter depends on local track conditions and can be recorded in a map\ntogether with other location-dependent information like speed limits and\ninclination. In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC) approach is\ndeveloped. Thanks to the knowledge of future changes of traction conditions,\nthe approach is able to avoid short-term skidding and sliding even under fast\nchanges of traction conditions. In a first step, an optimal reference\ntrajectory is determined by a multiple-shooting approach. In a second step, the\nreference trajectory is tracked by an MPC setup.

However, as the\nnumber of views grows, the issue of data quality becomes more apparent,\nlimiting the potential benefits of multi-view data. Although recent deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) based models can learn the weight of data adaptively, a lack of\nresearch on explicitly quantifying the data quality of each view when fusing\nthem renders these models inexplicable, performing unsatisfactorily and\ninflexible in downstream remote sensing tasks. To fill this gap, in this paper,\nevidential deep learning is introduced to the task of aerial-ground dual-view\nremote sensing scene classification to model the credibility of each view.\nSpecifically, the theory of evidence is used to calculate an uncertainty value\nwhich describes the decision-making risk of each view. Based on this\nuncertainty, a novel decision-level fusion strategy is proposed to ensure that\nthe view with lower risk obtains more weight, making the classification more\ncredible.

However,\na fully centralized RL approach is beset with difficulties in a multi-network\nscenario because of exponential growth in state-action space with increasing\nintersections. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can overcome the\nhigh-dimension problem by employing the global control of each local RL agent,\nbut it also brings new challenges, such as the failure of convergence caused by\nthe non-stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we introduce\nan off-policy nash deep Q-Network (OPNDQN) algorithm, which mitigates the\nweakness of both fully centralized and MARL approaches. The OPNDQN algorithm\nsolves the problem that traditional algorithms cannot be used in large\nstate-action space traffic models by utilizing a fictitious game approach at\neach iteration to find the nash equilibrium among neighboring intersections,\nfrom which no intersection has incentive to unilaterally deviate. One of main\nadvantages of OPNDQN is to mitigate the non-stationarity of multi-agent Markov\nprocess because it considers the mutual influence among neighboring\nintersections by sharing their actions.

We conduct an extensive experiments by using Simulation of Urban\nMObility simulator (SUMO), and show the dominant superiority of OPNDQN over\nseveral existing MARL approaches in terms of average queue length, episode\ntraining reward and average waiting time.",

    "title": "Federated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach via  Physics-Informed Reward for Multi-Microgrid Energy Management",
    "abstract": "The utilization of large-scale distributed renewable energy promotes the\ndevelopment of the multi-microgrid (MMG), which raises the need of developing\nan effective energy management method to minimize economic costs and keep self\nenergy-sufficiency. The multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has\nbeen widely used for the energy management problem because of its real-time\nscheduling ability. However, its training requires massive energy operation\ndata of microgrids (MGs), while gathering these data from different MGs would\nthreaten their privacy and data security. Therefore, this paper tackles this\npractical yet challenging issue by proposing a federated multi-agent deep\nreinforcement learning (F-MADRL) algorithm via the physics-informed reward. In\nthis algorithm, the federated learning (FL) mechanism is introduced to train\nthe F-MADRL algorithm thus ensures the privacy and the security of data. In\naddition, a decentralized MMG model is built, and the energy of each\nparticipated MG is managed by an agent, which aims to minimize economic costs\nand keep self energy-sufficiency according to the physics-informed reward. At\nfirst, MGs individually execute the self-training based on local energy\noperation data to train their local agent models. Then, these local models are\nperiodically uploaded to a server and their parameters are aggregated to build\na global agent, which will be broadcasted to MGs and replace their local\nagents. In this way, the experience of each MG agent can be shared and the\nenergy operation data is not explicitly transmitted, thus protecting the\nprivacy and ensuring data security. Finally, experiments are conducted on Oak\nRidge national laboratory distributed energy control communication lab\nmicrogrid (ORNL-MG) test system, and the comparisons are carried out to verify\nthe effectiveness of introducing the FL mechanism and the outperformance of our\nproposed F-MADRL.",

This study\npresents a modified Monte Carlo simulation procedure for estimating THz link\nattenuation due to multiple scattering by dust particles on the THz beam\npropagation path. Scattering models are developed for beams through dust, based\non Mie and Rayleigh approximations for corresponding frequencies for Earth\n(0.24 THz) and Mars (1.64 THz). The simulation results are compared,\nconsidering parameters such as the number of Monte-Carlo photon (MCP) packets,\nvisibility, dust particle placement density along the beam, frequency, and\ndistance between the transmitter and the receiver. Moreover, a channel capacity\nmodel was proposed, considering THz link attenuation due to dust storms,\nspreading loss and molecular absorption loss for Earth and Mars outdoor\nenvironments. Simulation results for Earth show that link attenuation increases\nwith dust particle placement density, distance and frequency, and attenuation\ndecreases with visibility. On Mars, similar results are obtained, except that\nthe attenuation is variate around a constant value with the frequency increase.\nChannel capacity is estimated for Earth and Mars environments considering time\nand distance-dependent scenarios. Time windows that show a sudden drop of dust\nparticles along the beam provide opportunities to communicate with high\nreliability. Moreover, increasing the distance between the transmitter and\nreceiver severely reduces the channel capacity measurement in strong dust storm\nconditions in both environments. Our study has found that weak dust storms have\nrelatively little effect on Mars, but much larger effects on Earth.",

    "abstract": "Model compression via quantization and sparsity enhancement has gained an\nimmense interest to enable the deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) in\nresource-constrained edge environments. Although these techniques have shown\npromising results in reducing the energy, latency and memory requirements of\nthe DNNs, their performance in non-ideal real-world settings (such as in the\npresence of hardware faults) is yet to be completely understood. In this paper,\nwe investigate the impact of bit-flip and stuck-at faults on activation-sparse\nquantized DNNs (QDNNs). We show that a high level of activation sparsity comes\nat the cost of larger vulnerability to faults. For instance, activation-sparse\nQDNNs exhibit up to 17.32% lower accuracy than the standard QDNNs. We also\nestablish that one of the major cause of the degraded accuracy is sharper\nminima in the loss landscape for activation-sparse QDNNs, which makes them more\nsensitive to perturbations in the weight values due to faults. Based on this\nobservation, we propose the mitigation of the impact of faults by employing a\nsharpness-aware quantization (SAQ) training scheme. The activation-sparse and\nstandard QDNNs trained with SAQ have up to 36.71% and 24.76% higher inference\naccuracy, respectively compared to their conventionally trained equivalents.\nMoreover, we show that SAQ-trained activation-sparse QDNNs show better accuracy\nin faulty settings than standard QDNNs trained conventionally. Thus the\nproposed technique can be instrumental in achieving sparsity-related\nenergy/latency benefits without compromising on fault tolerance.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we tackle two vital tasks in automated driving systems, i.e.,\ndriver intent prediction and risk object identification from egocentric images.\nMainly, we investigate the question: what would be good road scene-level\nrepresentations for these two tasks? We contend that a scene-level\nrepresentation must capture higher-level semantic and geometric representations\nof traffic scenes around ego-vehicle while performing actions to their\ndestinations. To this end, we introduce the representation of semantic regions,\nwhich are areas where ego-vehicles visit while taking an afforded action (e.g.,\nleft-turn at 4-way intersections). We propose to learn scene-level\nrepresentations via a novel semantic region prediction task and an automatic\nsemantic region labeling algorithm. Extensive evaluations are conducted on the\nHDD and nuScenes datasets, and the learned representations lead to\nstate-of-the-art performance for driver intention prediction and risk object\nidentification.",

We argue that - though neural approaches to text mining\nhave yielded impressive results in the past years - current benchmarks do not\nreflect the typical challenges encountered in the industrial wild properly.\nTherefore, our first contribution is an open benchmark coined IRT2 (inductive\nreasoning with text) that (1) covers knowledge graphs of varying sizes\n(including very small ones), (2) comes with incidental, low-quality text\nmentions, and (3) includes not only triple completion but also ranking, which\nis relevant for supporting experts with discovery tasks.\nWe investigate two neural models for inductive link prediction, one based on\nend-to-end learning and one that learns from the knowledge graph and text data\nin separate steps. These models compete with a strong bag-of-words baseline.\nThe results show a significant advance in performance for the neural approaches\nas soon as the available graph data decreases for linking.

Given\nthat it is unrealistic to expect existing quantum systems to provide, in near\nfuture, sufficient number of qubits that can accommodate large circuit, there\nis a pressing need to explore strategies that can somehow execute large\ncircuits on small systems. In this paper, first, we perform an analysis to\nidentify the qubits that are most suitable for circuit resizing. Our results\nreveal that, in most quantum programs, there exist qubits that can be reused\nmid-program to serially/sequentially execute the circuit employing fewer\nqubits. Motivated by this observation, we design, implement and evaluate a\ncompiler-based approach that i) identifies the qubits that can be most\nbeneficial for serial circuit execution; ii) selects those qubits to reuse at\neach step of execution for size minimization of the circuit; and iii) minimizes\nMiddle Measurement (MM) delays due to impractical implementation of shots to\nimprove the circuit reliability.

Furthermore, a time\nschedule is designed for timing each Kinect client's data transmission. In the\nexperiment, participants are asked to perform a 60 s walk while the proposed\ntracking system obtains the participant's gait data. Six joints (including left\nhip, right hip, left knee, right knee, left ankle and right ankle) of the\nparticipants are tracked where the obtained gait data are described as 6000\n{movements} of joint positions (1000 {movements} for each joint).

Within a randomly sampled time period (67.726 s in the experiment),\n98.37% of the frames generated by the gait tracking system have timing errors\nless than 1 ms, which is much better than the default NTP service embedded in\nthe Windows 8.1 operating system.

A convenient way for extending stylization techniques to videos\nis by applying them on a per-frame basis. However, such per-frame application\nusually lacks temporal-consistency expressed by undesirable flickering\nartifacts. Most of the existing approaches for enforcing temporal-consistency\nsuffers from one or more of the following drawbacks. They (1) are only suitable\nfor a limited range of stylization techniques, (2) can only be applied in an\noffline fashion requiring the complete video as input, (3) cannot provide\nconsistency for the task of stylization, or (4) do not provide interactive\nconsistency-control. Note that existing consistent video-filtering approaches\naim to completely remove flickering artifacts and thus do not respect any\nspecific consistency-control aspect. For stylization tasks, however,\nconsistency-control is an essential requirement where a certain amount of\nflickering can add to the artistic look and feel. Moreover, making this control\ninteractive is paramount from a usability perspective. To achieve the above\nrequirements, we propose an approach that can stylize video streams while\nproviding interactive consistency-control. Apart from stylization, our approach\nalso supports various other image processing filters. For achieving interactive\nperformance, we develop a lite optical-flow network that operates at 80 Frames\nper second (FPS) on desktop systems with sufficient accuracy. We show that the\nfinal consistent video-output using our flow network is comparable to that\nbeing obtained using state-of-the-art optical-flow network. Further, we employ\nan adaptive combination of local and global consistent features and enable\ninteractive selection between the two.

Image-based\nmethods to quantitatively and deterministically predict future received signal\nstrength using machine learning from time series of depth images to mitigate\nthe human body line-of-sight (LOS) path blockage in mmWave communications have\nbeen proposed. However, image-based methods have been limited in applicable\nenvironments because camera images may contain private information. Thus, this\nstudy demonstrates the feasibility of using point clouds obtained from light\ndetection and ranging (LiDAR) for the mmWave link quality prediction. Point\nclouds represent three-dimensional (3D) spaces as a set of points and are\nsparser and less likely to contain sensitive information than camera images.\nAdditionally, point clouds provide 3D position and motion information, which is\nnecessary for understanding the radio propagation environment involving\npedestrians. This study designs the mmWave link quality prediction method and\nconducts two experimental evaluations using different types of point clouds\nobtained from LiDAR and depth cameras, as well as different numerical\nindicators of link quality, received signal strength and throughput. Based on\nthese experiments, our proposed method can predict future large attenuation of\nmmWave link quality due to LOS blockage by human bodies, therefore our point\ncloud-based method can be an alternative to image-based methods.",

    "abstract": "In order to achieve high data rate and ubiquitous connectivity in future\nwireless networks, a key task is to efficiently manage the radio resource by\njudicious beamforming and power allocation. Unfortunately, the iterative nature\nof the commonly applied optimization-based algorithms cannot meet the low\nlatency requirements due to the high computational complexity. For real-time\nimplementations, deep learning-based approaches, especially the graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs), have been demonstrated with good scalability and\ngeneralization performance due to the permutation equivariance (PE) property.\nHowever, the current architectures are only equipped with the node-update\nmechanism, which prohibits the applications to a more general setup, where the\nunknown variables are also defined on the graph edges. To fill this gap, we\npropose an edge-update mechanism, which enables GNNs to handle both node and\nedge variables and prove its PE property with respect to both transmitters and\nreceivers. Simulation results on typical radio resource management problems\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher sum rate but with much\nshorter computation time than state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well on\ndifferent numbers of base stations and users, different noise variances,\ninterference levels, and transmit power budgets.",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the derivation of Non-Intrusive Reduced Basis (NIRB)\ntechniques for sensitivity analysis, more specifically the direct and adjoint\nstate methods. For highly complex parametric problems, these two approaches may\nbecome too costly. To reduce computational times, Proper Orthogonal\nDecomposition (POD) and Reduced Basis Methods (RBMs) have already been\ninvestigated. The majority of these algorithms are however intrusive in the\nsense that the High-Fidelity (HF) code must be modified. To address this issue,\nnon-intrusive strategies are employed. The NIRB two-grid method uses the HF\ncode solely as a ``black-box'', requiring no code modification. Like other\nRBMs, it is based on an offline-online decomposition. The offline stage is\ntime-consuming, but it is only executed once, whereas the online stage is\nsignificantly less expensive than an HF evaluation. In this paper, we propose\nnew NIRB two-grid algorithms for both the direct and adjoint state methods. On\na classical model problem, the heat equation, we prove that HF evaluations of\nsensitivities reach an optimal convergence rate in\n$L^{\\infty}(0,T;H^1(\\Omega))$, and then establish that these rates are\nrecovered by the proposed NIRB approximations. These results are supported by\nnumerical simulations. We then numerically demonstrate that a further\ndeterministic post-treatment can be applied to the direct method. This further\nreduces computational costs of the online step while only computing a coarse\nsolution of the initial problem. All numerical results are run with the model\nproblem as well as a more complex problem, namely the Brusselator system.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) in computer vision are\nprimarily comparative, whose goal is to preserve invariant and discriminative\nsemantics in latent representations by comparing siamese image views. However,\nthe preserved high-level semantics do not contain enough local information,\nwhich is vital in medical image analysis (e.g., image-based diagnosis and tumor\nsegmentation). To mitigate the locality problem of comparative SSL, we propose\nto incorporate the task of pixel restoration for explicitly encoding more\npixel-level information into high-level semantics. We also address the\npreservation of scale information, a powerful tool in aiding image\nunderstanding but has not drawn much attention in SSL. The resulting framework\ncan be formulated as a multi-task optimization problem on the feature pyramid.\nSpecifically, we conduct multi-scale pixel restoration and siamese feature\ncomparison in the pyramid.

We show\nthese behaviors still exist when words are randomly shuffled.

The effect is spurious and\nproblematic since bias metrics should depend exclusively on word co-occurrences\nand not individual word frequencies.

    "title": "Asymptotically compatibility of a class of numerical schemes for a  nonlocal traffic flow model",
    "abstract": "This paper considers numerical discretization of a nonlocal conservation law\nmodeling vehicular traffic flows involving nonlocal inter-vehicle interactions.\nThe nonlocal model involves an integral over the range measured by a horizon\nparameter and it recovers the local Lighthill-Richards-Whitham model as the\nnonlocal horizon parameter goes to zero. Good numerical schemes for simulating\nthese parameterized nonlocal traffic flow models should be robust with respect\nto the change of the model parameters but this has not been systematically\ninvestigated in the literature. We fill this gap through a careful study of a\nclass of finite volume numerical schemes with suitable discretizations of the\nnonlocal integral, which include several schemes proposed in the literature and\ntheir variants. Our main contributions are to demonstrate the asymptotically\ncompatibility of the schemes, which includes both the uniform convergence of\nthe numerical solutions to the unique solution of nonlocal continuum model for\na given positive horizon parameter and the convergence to the unique entropy\nsolution of the local model as the mesh size and the nonlocal horizon parameter\ngo to zero simultaneously. It is shown that with the asymptotically\ncompatibility, the schemes can provide robust numerical computation under the\nchanges of the nonlocal horizon parameter.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we focus on instance-level open vocabulary segmentation,\nintending to expand a segmenter for instance-wise novel categories without mask\nannotations. We investigate a simple yet effective framework with the help of\nimage captions, focusing on exploiting thousands of object nouns in captions to\ndiscover instances of novel classes. Rather than adopting pretrained caption\nmodels or using massive caption datasets with complex pipelines, we propose an\nend-to-end solution from two aspects: caption grounding and caption generation.\nIn particular, we devise a joint Caption Grounding and Generation (CGG)\nframework based on a Mask Transformer baseline. The framework has a novel\ngrounding loss that performs explicit and implicit multi-modal feature\nalignments. We further design a lightweight caption generation head to allow\nfor additional caption supervision. We find that grounding and generation\ncomplement each other, significantly enhancing the segmentation performance for\nnovel categories. We conduct extensive experiments on the COCO dataset with two\nsettings: Open Vocabulary Instance Segmentation (OVIS) and Open Set Panoptic\nSegmentation (OSPS). The results demonstrate the superiority of our CGG\nframework over previous OVIS methods, achieving a large improvement of 6.8% mAP\non novel classes without extra caption data. Our method also achieves over 15%\nPQ improvements for novel classes on the OSPS benchmark under various settings.",

    "abstract": "Driven by improved architectures and better representation learning\nframeworks, the field of visual recognition has enjoyed rapid modernization and\nperformance boost in the early 2020s. For example, modern ConvNets, represented\nby ConvNeXt, have demonstrated strong performance in various scenarios. While\nthese models were originally designed for supervised learning with ImageNet\nlabels, they can also potentially benefit from self-supervised learning\ntechniques such as masked autoencoders (MAE). However, we found that simply\ncombining these two approaches leads to subpar performance. In this paper, we\npropose a fully convolutional masked autoencoder framework and a new Global\nResponse Normalization (GRN) layer that can be added to the ConvNeXt\narchitecture to enhance inter-channel feature competition. This co-design of\nself-supervised learning techniques and architectural improvement results in a\nnew model family called ConvNeXt V2, which significantly improves the\nperformance of pure ConvNets on various recognition benchmarks, including\nImageNet classification, COCO detection, and ADE20K segmentation.

    "title": "SIRL: Similarity-based Implicit Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "When robots learn reward functions using high capacity models that take raw\nstate directly as input, they need to both learn a representation for what\nmatters in the task -- the task ``features\" -- as well as how to combine these\nfeatures into a single objective. If they try to do both at once from input\ndesigned to teach the full reward function, it is easy to end up with a\nrepresentation that contains spurious correlations in the data, which fails to\ngeneralize to new settings. Instead, our ultimate goal is to enable robots to\nidentify and isolate the causal features that people actually care about and\nuse when they represent states and behavior. Our idea is that we can tune into\nthis representation by asking users what behaviors they consider similar:\nbehaviors will be similar if the features that matter are similar, even if\nlow-level behavior is different; conversely, behaviors will be different if\neven one of the features that matter differs. This, in turn, is what enables\nthe robot to disambiguate between what needs to go into the representation\nversus what is spurious, as well as what aspects of behavior can be compressed\ntogether versus not. The notion of learning representations based on similarity\nhas a nice parallel in contrastive learning, a self-supervised representation\nlearning technique that maps visually similar data points to similar\nembeddings, where similarity is defined by a designer through data augmentation\nheuristics. By contrast, in order to learn the representations that people use,\nso we can learn their preferences and objectives, we use their definition of\nsimilarity. In simulation as well as in a user study, we show that learning\nthrough such similarity queries leads to representations that, while far from\nperfect, are indeed more generalizable than self-supervised and task-input\nalternatives.",

Our model integrates local evolutionary context from\nhomologous sequences, the global evolutionary context encoding rich semantic\nfrom the universal protein sequence space and the structure information\naccounting for the microenvironment around each residue in a protein. We show\nthat SESNet outperforms state-of-the-art models for predicting the\nsequence-function relationship on 26 deep mutational scanning datasets. More\nimportantly, we propose a data augmentation strategy by leveraging the data\nfrom unsupervised models to pre-train our model. After that, our model can\nachieve strikingly high accuracy in prediction of the fitness of protein\nmutants, especially for the higher order variants (> 4 mutation sites), when\nfinetuned by using only a small number of experimental mutation data (<50).

One of which, IBM quantum computing, presented a road map\nshowing their Kookaburra system with over 4158 qubits will be available in\n2025.

This timeline shows that FIPS-certified quantum-safe TLS protocol\nwould take a predictably long time. However, \"steal now, crack later\" tactic\nrequires protecting data against future quantum threat actors today. NIST\nrecommended the use of a hybrid mode of TLS 1.3 with its extensions to support\nPQC.

This paper proposes to take a\nnested mode to enable TLS 1.3 protocol with quantum-safe data, which can be\nmade available today and is FIPS compliant. We discussed the performance\nimpacts of the handshaking phase of the nested TLS 1.3 with PQC and the\nsymmetric encryption phase.

However, the requirement of excessive\nhigh-quality ground-truth data hinders their applications due to the\ngeneralization problem. Recently, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has\nappeared as a powerful DL-based tool for solving the inverse problem by\ncharacterizing the attributes of a signal as a continuous function of\ncorresponding coordinates in an unsupervised manner. In this work, we proposed\nan INR-based method to improve dynamic MRI reconstruction from highly\nundersampled k-space data, which only takes spatiotemporal coordinates as\ninputs. Specifically, the proposed INR represents the dynamic MRI images as an\nimplicit function and encodes them into neural networks. The weights of the\nnetwork are learned from sparsely-acquired (k, t)-space data itself only,\nwithout external training datasets or prior images. Benefiting from the strong\nimplicit continuity regularization of INR together with explicit regularization\nfor low-rankness and sparsity, our proposed method outperforms the compared\nscan-specific methods at various acceleration factors. E.g., experiments on\nretrospective cardiac cine datasets show an improvement of 5.5 ~ 7.1 dB in PSNR\nfor extremely high accelerations (up to 41.6-fold).

    "title": "Design of a Multi-User Wireless Powered Communication System Employing  Either Active IRS or AF Relay",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we optimize a Wireless Powered Communication (WPC) system\nincluding multiple pair of users, where transmitters employ single-antenna to\ntransmit their information and power to their receivers with the help of one\nmultiple-antennas Amplify-and-Forward (AF) relay or an active Intelligent\nReflecting Surface (IRS). We propose a joint Time Switching (TS) scheme in\nwhich transmitters, receivers, and the relay/IRS are either in their energy or\ninformation transmission/reception modes. The transmitted multi-carrier\nunmodulated and modulated waveforms are used for Energy Harvesting (EH) and\nInformation Decoding (ID) modes, respectively. In order to design an optimal\nfair system, we maximize the minimum rate of all pairs for both relay and IRS\nsystems through a unified framework. This framework allows us to simultaneously\ndesign energy waveforms, find optimal relay/IRS amplification/reflection\nmatrices, allocate powers for information waveforms, and allocate time\ndurations for various phases. In addition, we take into account the\nnon-linearity of the EH circuits in our problem. This problem turns out to be\nnon-convex. Thus, we propose an iterative algorithm by using the\nMinorization-Maximization (MM) technique, which quickly converges to the\noptimal solution. Numerical examples show that the proposed method improves the\nperformance of the multi-pair WPC relay/IRS system under various setups.",

This is partly due to large sample size. In this article, we study a\ngeneric two-stage distributionally robust linear program (2-DRLP) over a\n1-Wasserstein ball using an affine policy. The 2-DRLP has right-hand-side\nuncertainty with a rectangular support. Our main contribution is to show that\nthe 2-DRLP problem has a tractable reformulation with a scale independent of\nsample size. The reformulated problem can be solved within a pre-defined\noptimality tolerance using robust optimization techniques. To reduce the\ninevitable conservativeness of the affine policy while preserving independence\nof sample size, we further develop a method for constructing an uncertainty set\nwith a probabilistic guarantee over which the Wasserstein ball is re-defined.\nAs an application, we present a novel unit commitment model for power systems\nunder uncertainty of renewable energy generation to examine the effectiveness\nof the proposed 2-DRLP technique.

This generalizes the standard multi-armed bandit to the\ncase where side information is available, e.g., patients' records or customers'\nhistory, which allows for personalized treatment. We focus on consistency --\nvanishing regret compared to the optimal policy -- and show that for large\nclasses of non-i.i.d. contexts, consistency can be achieved regardless of the\ntime-invariant reward mechanism, a property known as universal consistency.\nPrecisely, we first give necessary and sufficient conditions on the\ncontext-generating process for universal consistency to be possible. Second, we\nshow that there always exists an algorithm that guarantees universal\nconsistency whenever this is achievable, called an optimistically universal\nlearning rule. Interestingly, for finite action spaces, learnable processes for\nuniversal learning are exactly the same as in the full-feedback setting of\nsupervised learning, previously studied in the literature. In other words,\nlearning can be performed with partial feedback without any generalization\ncost. The algorithms balance a trade-off between generalization (similar to\nstructural risk minimization) and personalization (tailoring actions to\nspecific contexts).

However, ground blockages against line-of-sight (LOS) signal\nreception make it difficult for GNSS users. Steering local codes in GNSS\nbasebands is a desiring way to correct instantaneous signal phase misalignment,\nefficiently gathering useful signal power and increasing positioning accuracy.\nBesides, inertial navigation systems (INSs) have been used as a\nwell-complementary dead reckoning (DR) sensor for GNSS receivers in kinematic\nscenarios resisting various interferences since early. But little work focuses\non the case of whether the INS can improve GNSS receivers in static scenarios.\nThus, this paper proposes an enhanced navigation system deeply integrated with\nlow-cost INS solutions and GNSS high-accuracy carrier-based positioning.

To address this question, this paper presents a novel agent-based\nmodel of an organization that features bottom-up task allocation that can be\nmotivated by either long-term or short-term orientation on the agents' side.\nThe model also includes an incentive mechanism to guide the bottom-up task\nallocation process and create incentives that range from altruistic to\nindividualistic. Our analysis shows that when bottom-up task allocation is\ndriven by short-term orientation and aligned with the incentive mechanisms, it\nleads to improved organizational performance that surpasses that of\ntraditionally designed organizations.

Unfortunately, TDOA\nestimation is very sensitive to reverberation and additive noise. We introduce\nan unsupervised data-driven approach that exploits the natural structure of the\ndata. Our method builds upon local conformal autoencoders (LOCA) - an offline\ndeep learning scheme for learning standardized data coordinates from\nmeasurements. Our experimental setup includes a microphone array that measures\nthe transmitted sound source at multiple locations across the acoustic\nenclosure. We demonstrate that LOCA learns a representation that is isometric\nto the spatial locations of the microphones. The performance of our method is\nevaluated using a series of realistic simulations and compared with other\ndimensionality-reduction schemes.

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic trees (i.e. evolutionary trees, additive trees or X-trees) play\na key role in the processes of modeling and representing species evolution.\nGenome evolution of a given group of species is usually modeled by a species\nphylogenetic tree that represents the main patterns of vertical descent.\nHowever, the evolution of each gene is unique. It can be represented by its own\ngene tree which can differ substantially from a general species tree\nrepresentation. Consensus trees and supertrees have been widely used in\nevolutionary studies to combine phylogenetic information contained in\nindividual gene trees. Nevertheless, if the available gene trees are quite\ndifferent from each other, then the resulting consensus tree or supertree can\neither include many unresolved subtrees corresponding to internal nodes of high\ndegree or can simply be a star tree. This may happen if the available gene\ntrees have been affected by different reticulate evolutionary events, such as\nhorizontal gene transfer, hybridization or genetic recombination. Thus, the\nproblem of inferring multiple alternative consensus trees or supertrees, using\nclustering, becomes relevant since it allows one to regroup in different\nclusters gene trees having similar evolutionary patterns (e.g. gene trees\nrepresenting genes that have undergone the same horizontal gene transfer or\nrecombination events). We critically review recent advances and methods in the\nfield of phylogenetic tree clustering, discuss the methods' mathematical\nproperties, and describe the main advantages and limitations of multiple\nconsensus tree and supertree approaches. In the application section, we show\nhow the multiple supertree clustering approach can be used to cluster aaRS gene\ntrees according to their evolutionary patterns.",

    "abstract": "Variational autoencoders model high-dimensional data by positing\nlow-dimensional latent variables that are mapped through a flexible\ndistribution parametrized by a neural network. Unfortunately, variational\nautoencoders often suffer from posterior collapse: the posterior of the latent\nvariables is equal to its prior, rendering the variational autoencoder useless\nas a means to produce meaningful representations. Existing approaches to\nposterior collapse often attribute it to the use of neural networks or\noptimization issues due to variational approximation. In this paper, we\nconsider posterior collapse as a problem of latent variable\nnon-identifiability. We prove that the posterior collapses if and only if the\nlatent variables are non-identifiable in the generative model. This fact\nimplies that posterior collapse is not a phenomenon specific to the use of\nflexible distributions or approximate inference. Rather, it can occur in\nclassical probabilistic models even with exact inference, which we also\ndemonstrate. Based on these results, we propose a class of latent-identifiable\nvariational autoencoders, deep generative models which enforce identifiability\nwithout sacrificing flexibility. This model class resolves the problem of\nlatent variable non-identifiability by leveraging bijective Brenier maps and\nparameterizing them with input convex neural networks, without special\nvariational inference objectives or optimization tricks. Across synthetic and\nreal datasets, latent-identifiable variational autoencoders outperform existing\nmethods in mitigating posterior collapse and providing meaningful\nrepresentations of the data.",

In all scenarios, we find confirmation of the established\nright-lateralized Theta sampling network anomaly, in line with the temporal\nsampling framework's assumption of oscillatory differences in the Theta and\nGamma bands. Further, we show that this anomaly primarily occurs in the causal\nrelationships of channels acting as sinks, where it is significantly more\npronounced than when only total activity is observed.

Associations between\nusers' preferences and socio-demographic characteristics, such as age, gender,\nteleworking frequency and the presence of a delivery box, were also suggested.\nMoreover, we analyzed two willingness-to-pay measures for delivery, namely, the\nvalue of delivery time savings (VODT) and the value of time slot shortening\n(VOTS), and applied a non-semiparametric approach to estimate their\ndistributions in a data-oriented manner. Although VODT has a large\nheterogeneity among respondents, the estimated median VODT is 25.6 JPY/day,\nimplying that more than half of the respondents would wait an additional day if\nthe delivery fee were increased by only 26 JPY, that is, they do not\nnecessarily need a fast delivery option but often request it when cheap or\nalmost free.

The TQFT is defined over the Boolean semiring\n$\\mathbb{B}$. Different automata for a fixed language $L$ produce TQFTs that\ndiffer by their values on decorated circles, while the values on decorated\nintervals are described by the language $L$. The language $L$ and the TQFT\nassociated to an automaton can be given a path integral interpretation.\nIn this TQFT the state space of a one-point 0-manifold is a free module over\n$\\mathbb{B}$ with the basis of states of the automaton. Replacing a free module\nby a finite projective $\\mathbb{B}$-module $P$ allows to generalize automata\nand this type of TQFT to a structure where defects act on open subsets of a\nfinite topological space. Intersection of open subsets induces a multiplication\non $P$ allowing to extend the TQFT to a TQFT for one-dimensional foams\n(oriented graphs with defects modulo a suitable equivalence relation).\nA linear version of these constructions is also explained, with the Boolean\nsemiring replaced by a commutative ring.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical properties of bilevel problems are well studied when the\nlower-level problem is strongly convex. In this work, we focus on bilevel\noptimization problems without the strong-convexity assumption. In these cases,\nwe first show that the common local optimality measures such as KKT condition\nor regularization can lead to undesired consequences. Then, we aim to identify\nthe mildest conditions that make bilevel problems tractable. We identify two\nclasses of growth conditions on the lower-level objective that leads to\ncontinuity. Under these assumptions, we show that the local optimality of the\nbilevel problem can be defined via the Goldstein stationarity condition of the\nhyper-objective. We then propose the Inexact Gradient-Free Method (IGFM) to\nsolve the bilevel problem, using an approximate zeroth order oracle that is of\nindependent interest. Our non-asymptotic analysis demonstrates that the\nproposed method can find a $(\\delta, \\varepsilon)$ Goldstein stationary point\nfor bilevel problems with a zeroth order oracle complexity that is polynomial\nin $d, 1/\\delta$ and $1/\\varepsilon$.",

Due to challenges of creating tractable EVSI expressions,\nmost existing work valuing data does so in one of three ways: 1) analytically\nthrough closed-form expressions on the upper bound of the value of data, 2)\ncalculating the expected value of data using numerical comparisons of decisions\nmade using simulated data to optimal decisions where the underlying data\ndistribution is known, or 3) using variance reduction as proxy for the\nuncertainty reduction that accompanies more data.

We calibrate our model to the early outbreak stages of the SARS-CoV-2\npandemic in 2020.

    "abstract": "An increasing number of public datasets have shown a marked clinical impact\non assessing anatomical structures. However, each of the datasets is small,\npartially labeled, and rarely investigates severe tumor subjects. Moreover,\ncurrent models are limited to segmenting specific organs/tumors, which can not\nbe extended to novel domains and classes. To tackle these limitations, we\nintroduce embedding learned from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)\nto segmentation models, dubbed the CLIP-Driven Universal Model. The Universal\nModel can better segment 25 organs and 6 types of tumors by exploiting the\nsemantic relationship between abdominal structures. The model is developed from\nan assembly of 14 datasets with 3,410 CT scans and evaluated on 6,162 external\nCT scans from 3 datasets. We rank first on the public leaderboard of the\nMedical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) and achieve the state-of-the-art results\non Beyond The Cranial Vault (BTCV). Compared with dataset-specific models, the\nUniversal Model is computationally more efficient (6x faster), generalizes\nbetter to CT scans from varying sites, and shows stronger transfer learning\nperformance on novel tasks.

Using the Numerai tournament data set as a\nmotivating example, we propose a machine learning pipeline for trading\nmarket-neutral stock portfolios based on tabular data which is robust under\nchanges in market conditions. We evaluate various machine-learning models,\nincluding Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDTs) and Neural Networks with and\nwithout simple feature engineering, as the building blocks for the pipeline. We\nfind that GBDT models with dropout display high performance, robustness and\ngeneralisability with relatively low complexity and reduced computational cost.\nWe then show that online learning techniques can be used in post-prediction\nprocessing to enhance the results. In particular, dynamic feature\nneutralisation, an efficient procedure that requires no retraining of models\nand can be applied post-prediction to any machine learning model, improves\nrobustness by reducing drawdown in volatile market conditions. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that the creation of model ensembles through dynamic model\nselection based on recent model performance leads to improved performance over\nbaseline by improving the Sharpe and Calmar ratios.
