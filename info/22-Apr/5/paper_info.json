    "abstract": "We present a new cognitive architecture that combines two neurobiologically\nplausible, computational models: (1) a variant of predictive processing known\nas neural generative coding (NGC) and (2) hyperdimensional, vector-symbolic\nmodels of human memory. We draw inspiration from well-known cognitive\narchitectures such as ACT-R, Soar, Leabra, and Spaun/Nengo. Our cognitive\narchitecture, the COGnitive Neural GENerative system (CogNGen), is in broad\nagreement with these architectures, but provides a level of detail between\nACT-R's high-level, symbolic description of human cognition and Spaun's\nlow-level neurobiological description. CogNGen creates the groundwork for\ndeveloping agents that learn continually from diverse tasks and model human\nperformance at larger scales than what is possible with existent cognitive\narchitectures. We aim to develop a cognitive architecture that has the power of\nmodern machine learning techniques while retaining long-term memory,\nsingle-trial learning, transfer-learning, planning, and other capacities\nassociated with high-level cognition. We test CogNGen on a set of maze-learning\ntasks, including mazes that test short-term memory and planning, and find that\nthe addition of vector-symbolic models of memory improves the ability of the\nNGC reinforcement learning model to master the maze task. Future work includes\ntesting CogNGen on more tasks and exploring methods for efficiently scaling\nhyperdimensional memory models to lifetime learning.",

    "abstract": "Our environment is filled with rich and dynamic acoustic information. When we\nwalk into a cathedral, the reverberations as much as appearance inform us of\nthe sanctuary's wide open space. Similarly, as an object moves around us, we\nexpect the sound emitted to also exhibit this movement. While recent advances\nin learned implicit functions have led to increasingly higher quality\nrepresentations of the visual world, there have not been commensurate advances\nin learning spatial auditory representations. To address this gap, we introduce\nNeural Acoustic Fields (NAFs), an implicit representation that captures how\nsounds propagate in a physical scene. By modeling acoustic propagation in a\nscene as a linear time-invariant system, NAFs learn to continuously map all\nemitter and listener location pairs to a neural impulse response function that\ncan then be applied to arbitrary sounds. We demonstrate that the continuous\nnature of NAFs enables us to render spatial acoustics for a listener at an\narbitrary location, and can predict sound propagation at novel locations. We\nfurther show that the representation learned by NAFs can help improve visual\nlearning with sparse views. Finally, we show that a representation informative\nof scene structure emerges during the learning of NAFs.",

Existing commercially-available robotic systems and research\nprototypes all use existing commercially available ICE catheters based on\nmultiple tendon-sheath mechanism (TSM). To motorize the existing TSM-based ICE\ncatheter, the actuators interface with the outer handle knobs to manipulate\nfour internal tendons. However, in practice, the actuators are located at a\nsterile, safe place far away from the ICE handle. Thus, to interface with\nknobs, there exist multiple coupled gear structures between two, leading to a\nhighly nonlinear behavior (e.g. various slack, elasticity) alongside hysteresis\nphenomena in TSM.\nSince ICE catheters are designed for single use, the expensive actuators need\nto be located in a safe place so as to be reusable. Moreover, these actuators\nshould interface as directly as possible with the tendons for accurate tip\ncontrols.

Aiming at it, this paper proposes a novel\nframework with mathematical underpinnings for turbine power prediction. This\nframework is the first time to incorporate knowledge distillation into energy\nforecasting, enabling accurate and economical constructions of turbine models\nby learning knowledge from the well-established park model.

    "abstract": "Frequency estimation of elements is an important task for summarizing data\nstreams and machine learning applications. The problem is often addressed by\nusing streaming algorithms with sublinear space data structures. These\nalgorithms allow processing of large data while using limited data storage.\nCommonly used streaming algorithms, such as count-min sketch, have many\nadvantages, but do not take into account properties of a data stream for\nperformance optimization. In the present paper we introduce a novel\ndouble-hashing algorithm that provides flexibility to optimize streaming\nalgorithms depending on the properties of a given stream. In the double-hashing\napproach, first a standard streaming algorithm is employed to obtain an\nestimate of the element frequencies. This estimate is derived using a fraction\nof the stream and allows identification of the heavy hitters. Next, it uses a\nmodified hash table where the heavy hitters are mapped into individual buckets\nand other stream elements are mapped into the remaining buckets. Finally, the\nelement frequencies are estimated based on the constructed hash table over the\nentire data stream with any streaming algorithm. We demonstrate on both\nsynthetic data and an internet query log dataset that our approach is capable\nof improving frequency estimation due to removing heavy hitters from the\nhashing process and, thus, reducing collisions in the hash table. Our approach\navoids employing additional machine learning models to identify heavy hitters\nand, thus, reduces algorithm complexity and streamlines implementation.\nMoreover, because it is not dependent on specific features of the stream\nelements for identifying heavy hitters, it is applicable to a large variety of\nstreams. In addition, we propose a procedure on how to dynamically adjust the\nproposed double-hashing algorithm when frequencies of the elements in a stream\nare changing over time.",

    "title": "Learnable latent embeddings for joint behavioral and neural analysis",
    "abstract": "Mapping behavioral actions to neural activity is a fundamental goal of\nneuroscience. As our ability to record large neural and behavioral data\nincreases, there is growing interest in modeling neural dynamics during\nadaptive behaviors to probe neural representations. In particular, neural\nlatent embeddings can reveal underlying correlates of behavior, yet, we lack\nnon-linear techniques that can explicitly and flexibly leverage joint behavior\nand neural data. Here, we fill this gap with a novel method, CEBRA, that\njointly uses behavioral and neural data in a hypothesis- or discovery-driven\nmanner to produce consistent, high-performance latent spaces. We validate its\naccuracy and demonstrate our tool's utility for both calcium and\nelectrophysiology datasets, across sensory and motor tasks, and in simple or\ncomplex behaviors across species. It allows for single and multi-session\ndatasets to be leveraged for hypothesis testing or can be used label-free.\nLastly, we show that CEBRA can be used for the mapping of space, uncovering\ncomplex kinematic features, and rapid, high-accuracy decoding of natural movies\nfrom visual cortex.",

    "title": "Design of Low Thrust Controlled Maneuvers to Chase and De-orbit the  Space Debris",
    "abstract": "Over the several decades, the space debris at LEO has grown rapidly which had\ncaused a serious threat to the operating satellite in an orbit. To avoid the\nrisk of collision and protect the LEO environment, the space robotics ADR\nconcept has been continuously developed for over a decade to chase, capture,\nand deorbit space debris. This paper presents the designed small satellite with\ndual robotic manipulators. The small satellite is designed based on CubeSat\nstandards, which uses commercially available products in the market. In this\npaper, an approach is detailed for designing the controlled chase and deorbit\nmaneuver for a small satellite equipped with an RCS thruster. The maneuvers are\ncomprised of two phases, a. bringing the chaser satellite to the debris orbit\nand accelerating it to close proximity of 1m to the debris object by using the\nlow thrust RCS thruster, and b. Once captured, controlled deorbiting it to 250\nkm of altitude. A Hohmann transfer concept is used to move our chaser satellite\nfrom the lower orbit to the debris orbit by two impulsive burns. A number of\nthe scenarios are simulated, where one or more orbital elements are adjusted.\nFor more than one orbital elements adjustment, the DAG law and the Q law are\nutilized. These laws synthesize the three direction thrusts to the single\nthrust force for the controlled maneuver. The $\\Delta$V requirement at each\nmaneuver is determined by using the performance parameters of the RCS thruster\nintended for a small satellite. The results show that, for long term simulation\nof a chaser satellite maneuver to debris object, an optimum DAG law is most\nsuitable than the Q law, as it can handle the singularity behavior of the\norbital elements caused due by adjustment of one or more elements more\nefficiently.",

Wildfires\npose direct threats to life and property as well as threats through ancillary\neffects like reduced air quality. The aim of this thesis is to develop\ntechniques to help combat the impacts of wildfires by improving wildfire\nmodeling capabilities by using satellite fire observations. Already much work\nhas been done in this direction by other researchers. Our work seeks to expand\nthe body of knowledge using mathematically sound methods to utilize information\nabout wildfires that considers the uncertainties inherent in the satellite\ndata.\nIn this thesis we explore methods for using satellite data to help initialize\nand steer wildfire simulations. In particular, we develop a method for\nconstructing the history of a fire, a new technique for assimilating wildfire\ndata, and a method for modifying the behavior of a modeled fire by inferring\ninformation about the fuels in the fire domain. These goals rely on being able\nto estimate the time a fire first arrived at every location in a geographic\nregion of interest. Because detailed knowledge of real wildfires is typically\nunavailable, the basic procedure for developing and testing the methods in this\nthesis will be to first work with simulated data so that the estimates produced\ncan be compared with known solutions. The methods thus developed are then\napplied to real-world scenarios. Analysis of these scenarios shows that the\nwork with constructing the history of fires and data assimilation improves\nimproves fire modeling capabilities. The research is significant because it\ngives us a better understanding of the capabilities and limitations of using\nsatellite data to inform wildfire models and it points the way towards new\navenues for modeling fire behavior.",

Multiple\ntesting techniques are proposed to generate test cases that can expose\ninconsistencies in the behavior of DNN models. These techniques assume\nimplicitly that the training program is bug-free and appropriately configured.\nHowever, satisfying this assumption for a novel problem requires significant\nengineering work to prepare the data, design the DNN, implement the training\nprogram, and tune the hyperparameters in order to produce the model for which\ncurrent automated test data generators search for corner-case behaviors.

Each arm is\nassociated with an unknown law on safety risks and rewards, and the learner's\ngoal is to maximise reward whilst not playing unsafe arms, as determined by a\ngiven threshold on the mean risk.\nWe formulate a pseudo-regret for this setting that enforces this safety\nconstraint in a per-round way by softly penalising any violation, regardless of\nthe gain in reward due to the same. This has practical relevance to scenarios\nsuch as clinical trials, where one must maintain safety for each round rather\nthan in an aggregated sense.\nWe describe doubly optimistic strategies for this scenario, which maintain\noptimistic indices for both safety risk and reward. We show that schema based\non both frequentist and Bayesian indices satisfy tight gap-dependent\nlogarithmic regret bounds, and further that these play unsafe arms only\nlogarithmically many times in total.

In this paper, we consider a specific instance of such\nqueries: queries that contain typos. We show that a small character level\nperturbation in queries (as caused by typos) highly impacts the effectiveness\nof dense retrievers. We then demonstrate that the root cause of this resides in\nthe input tokenization strategy employed by BERT. In BERT, tokenization is\nperformed using the BERT's WordPiece tokenizer and we show that a token with a\ntypo will significantly change the token distributions obtained after\ntokenization. This distribution change translates to changes in the input\nembeddings passed to the BERT-based query encoder of dense retrievers. We then\nturn our attention to devising dense retriever methods that are robust to such\ntypo queries, while still being as performant as previous methods on queries\nwithout typos. For this, we use CharacterBERT as the backbone encoder and an\nefficient yet effective training method, called Self-Teaching (ST), that\ndistills knowledge from queries without typos into the queries with typos.\nExperimental results show that CharacterBERT in combination with ST achieves\nsignificantly higher effectiveness on queries with typos compared to previous\nmethods. Along with these results and the open-sourced implementation of the\nmethods, we also provide a new passage retrieval dataset consisting of\nreal-world queries with typos and associated relevance assessments on the MS\nMARCO corpus, thus supporting the research community in the investigation of\neffective and robust dense retrievers.",

    "abstract": "With the rising prevalence of autism diagnoses, it is essential for research\nto understand how to leverage technology to support the diverse nature of\nautistic traits. While traditional interventions focused on technology for\nmedical cure and rehabilitation, recent research aims to understand how\ntechnology can accommodate each unique situation in an efficient and engaging\nway. Extended reality (XR) technology has been shown to be effective in\nimproving attention in autistic users given that it is more engaging and\nmotivating than other traditional mediums. Here, we conducted a systematic\nreview of 59 research articles that explored the role of attention in XR\ninterventions for autistic users. We systematically analyzed demographics,\nstudy design and findings, including autism screening and attention measurement\nmethods. Furthermore, given methodological inconsistencies in the literature,\nwe systematically synthesize methods and protocols including screening tools,\nphysiological and behavioral cues of autism and XR tasks. While there is\nsubstantial evidence for the effectiveness of using XR in attention-based\ninterventions for autism to support autistic traits, we have identified three\nprincipal research gaps that provide promising research directions to examine\nhow autistic populations interact with XR. First, our findings highlight the\ndisproportionate geographic locations of autism studies and underrepresentation\nof autistic adults, evidence of gender disparity, and presence of individuals\ndiagnosed with co-occurring conditions across studies. Second, many studies\nused an assortment of standardized and novel tasks and self-report assessments\nwith limited tested reliability. Lastly, the research lacks evidence of\nperformance maintenance and transferability.",

A graph class $\\mathcal C$ is said\ndelineated if for every hereditary closure $\\mathcal D$ of a subclass of\n$\\mathcal C$, it holds that $\\mathcal D$ has bounded twin-width if and only if\n$\\mathcal D$ is monadically dependent. An effective strengthening of\ndelineation for a class $\\mathcal C$ implies that tractable FO model checking\non $\\mathcal C$ is perfectly understood: On hereditary closures $\\mathcal D$ of\nsubclasses of $\\mathcal C$, FO model checking is fixed-parameter tractable\n(FPT) exactly when $\\mathcal D$ has bounded twin-width. Ordered graphs\n[BGOdMSTT, STOC '22] and permutation graphs [BKTW, JACM '22] are effectively\ndelineated, while subcubic graphs are not. On the one hand, we prove that\ninterval graphs, and even, rooted directed path graphs are delineated. On the\nother hand, we show that segment graphs, directed path graphs, and visibility\ngraphs of simple polygons are not delineated. In an effort to draw the\ndelineation frontier between interval graphs (that are delineated) and\naxis-parallel two-lengthed segment graphs (that are not), we investigate the\ntwin-width of restricted segment intersection classes. It was known that\n(triangle-free) pure axis-parallel unit segment graphs have unbounded\ntwin-width [BGKTW, SODA '21]. We show that $K_{t,t}$-free segment graphs, and\naxis-parallel $H_t$-free unit segment graphs have bounded twin-width, where\n$H_t$ is the half-graph or ladder of height $t$. In contrast, axis-parallel\n$H_4$-free two-lengthed segment graphs have unbounded twin-width. Our new\nresults, combined with the known FPT algorithm for FO model checking on graphs\ngiven with $O(1)$-sequences, lead to win-win arguments.

    "abstract": "People spend a significant amount of time in indoor spaces (e.g., office\nbuildings, subway systems, etc.) in their daily lives. Therefore, it is\nimportant to develop efficient indoor spatial query algorithms for supporting\nvarious location-based applications. However, indoor spaces differ from outdoor\nspaces because users have to follow the indoor floor plan for their movements.\nIn addition, positioning in indoor environments is mainly based on sensing\ndevices (e.g., RFID readers) rather than GPS devices. Consequently, we cannot\napply existing spatial query evaluation techniques devised for outdoor\nenvironments for this new challenge.

Based on the\ninference method and tracking models, we develop innovative indoor range and k\nnearest neighbor (kNN) query algorithms.

    "title": "Modeling Dynamic User Preference via Dictionary Learning for Sequential  Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Capturing the dynamics in user preference is crucial to better predict user\nfuture behaviors because user preferences often drift over time. Many existing\nrecommendation algorithms -- including both shallow and deep ones -- often\nmodel such dynamics independently, i.e., user static and dynamic preferences\nare not modeled under the same latent space, which makes it difficult to fuse\nthem for recommendation. This paper considers the problem of embedding a user's\nsequential behavior into the latent space of user preferences, namely\ntranslating sequence to preference. To this end, we formulate the sequential\nrecommendation task as a dictionary learning problem, which learns: 1) a shared\ndictionary matrix, each row of which represents a partial signal of user\ndynamic preferences shared across users; and 2) a posterior distribution\nestimator using a deep autoregressive model integrated with Gated Recurrent\nUnit (GRU), which can select related rows of the dictionary to represent a\nuser's dynamic preferences conditioned on his/her past behaviors. Qualitative\nstudies on the Netflix dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can capture\nthe user preference drifts over time and quantitative studies on multiple\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve higher\naccuracy compared with state-of-the-art factorization and neural sequential\nrecommendation methods.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel method that takes all the objects into consideration\nand explores their mutual relationships to help better estimate the 3D boxes.\nMoreover, since 2D detection is more reliable currently, we also investigate\nhow to use the detected 2D boxes as guidance to globally constrain the\noptimization of the corresponding predicted 3D boxes.

Thanks to the concise design, our\nloss function is universal and can be plugged into any mature monocular 3D\ndetector, while significantly boosting the performance over their baseline.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method yields the best performance (Nov. 2021)\ncompared with the other state-of-the-arts by a large margin on KITTI 3D\ndatasets.",

    "abstract": "Data often has many semantic attributes that are causally associated with\neach other. But do attribute-specific learned representations of data also\nrespect the same causal relations? We answer this question in three steps.\nFirst, we introduce NCINet, an approach for observational causal discovery from\nhigh-dimensional data. It is trained purely on synthetically generated\nrepresentations and can be applied to real representations, and is specifically\ndesigned to mitigate the domain gap between the two. Second, we apply NCINet to\nidentify the causal relations between image representations of different pairs\nof attributes with known and unknown causal relations between the labels. For\nthis purpose, we consider image representations learned for predicting\nattributes on the 3D Shapes, CelebA, and the CASIA-WebFace datasets, which we\nannotate with multiple multi-class attributes. Third, we analyze the effect on\nthe underlying causal relation between learned representations induced by\nvarious design choices in representation learning. Our experiments indicate\nthat (1) NCINet significantly outperforms existing observational causal\ndiscovery approaches for estimating the causal relation between pairs of random\nsamples, both in the presence and absence of an unobserved confounder, (2)\nunder controlled scenarios, learned representations can indeed satisfy the\nunderlying causal relations between their respective labels, and (3) the causal\nrelations are positively correlated with the predictive capability of the\nrepresentations.",

Golang\n(Go for short) is a modern programming language that makes concurrency a\nfirst-class citizen. Go offers both message passing and shared memory for\ncommunicating among concurrent threads. Go is gaining popularity in modern\nmicroservice-based systems. Data races in Go stand in the face of its emerging\npopularity.\nIn this paper, using our industrial codebase as an example, we demonstrate\nthat Go developers embrace concurrency and show how the abundance of\nconcurrency alongside language idioms and nuances make Go programs highly\nsusceptible to data races. Google's Go distribution ships with a built-in\ndynamic data race detector based on ThreadSanitizer. However, dynamic race\ndetectors pose scalability and flakiness challenges; we discuss various\nsoftware engineering trade-offs to make this detector work effectively at\nscale. We have deployed this detector in Uber's 46 million lines of Go codebase\nhosting 2100 distinct microservices, found over 2000 data races, and fixed over\n1000 data races, spanning 790 distinct code patches submitted by 210 unique\ndevelopers over a six-month period.

This paper optimizes transmit power for the initial\ntransmission and the subsequent retransmissions of HARQ with either incremental\nredundancy or Chase combining, aiming to minimize the expected energy\nconsumption given the target outage probability and the target latency. The\nmain challenge is due to the fact that the outage probability is a complicated\nfunction of the power variables which are nested in successive convolutions.\nThe existing works mostly use a classic upper bound to approximate the outage\nprobability by assuming unbounded transmit power, then convert the original\nproblem to a geometric programming (GP) problem. In contrast, we propose a\nnovel and much tighter upper bound by taking the practical power limit into\nconsideration. The new bound and the resulting new GP method are further\nextended to a broader group of channel models with various fading, multiple\nantennas, and multiple receivers.

To put into practice,\nthis study aims to reveal the real-world emission reduction of ridesplitting\nand its determinants based on the observed data of ridesourcing in Chengdu,\nChina. Integrating the trip data with the COPERT model, this study calculates\nthe CO2 emissions of shared rides (ridesplitting) and their substituted single\nrides (regular ridesourcing) to estimate the CO2 emission reduction of each\nridesplitting trip. The results show that not all ridesplitting trips reduce\nemissions from ridesourcing in the real world. The CO2 emission reduction rate\nof ridesplitting varies from trip to trip, averaging at 43.15g/km. Then, the\ninterpretable machine learning models, gradient boosting machines, are applied\nto explore the relationship between the CO2 emission reduction rate of\nridesplitting and its determinants. Based on the SHapley Additive exPlanations\nmethod, the overlap rate and detour rate of shared rides are identified to be\nthe most important factors that determine the CO2 emission reduction rate of\nridesplitting. Increasing the overlap rate, the number of shared rides, average\nspeed, and ride distance ratio and decreasing the detour rate, actual trip\ndistance, ride distance gap can increase the CO2 emission reduction rate of\nridesplitting. In addition, nonlinear effects and interactions of several key\nfactors are examined through the partial dependence plots.

    "abstract": "When deploying pre-trained neural network models in real-world applications,\nmodel consumers often encounter resource-constraint platforms such as mobile\nand smart devices. They typically use the pruning technique to reduce the size\nand complexity of the model, generating a lighter one with less resource\nconsumption. Nonetheless, most existing pruning methods are proposed with a\npremise that the model after being pruned has a chance to be fine-tuned or even\nretrained based on the original training data. This may be unrealistic in\npractice, as the data controllers are often reluctant to provide their model\nconsumers with the original data. In this work, we study the neural network\npruning in the \\emph{data-free} context, aiming to yield lightweight models\nthat are not only accurate in prediction but also robust against undesired\ninputs in open-world deployments. Considering the absence of the fine-tuning\nand retraining that can fix the mis-pruned units, we replace the traditional\naggressive one-shot strategy with a conservative one that treats the pruning as\na progressive process. We propose a pruning method based on stochastic\noptimization that uses robustness-related metrics to guide the pruning process.\nOur method is implemented as a Python package named \\textsc{Paoding} and\nevaluated with a series of experiments on diverse neural network models.

However, few researches have focused on the scenario where the\nsource-language labeled data is also limited in some specific domains. A common\napproach for this scenario is to generate more training data through\ntranslation or generation-based data augmentation method.

    "title": "Improving the Factual Accuracy of Abstractive Clinical Text  Summarization using Multi-Objective Optimization",
    "abstract": "While there has been recent progress in abstractive summarization as applied\nto different domains including news articles, scientific articles, and blog\nposts, the application of these techniques to clinical text summarization has\nbeen limited. This is primarily due to the lack of large-scale training data\nand the messy/unstructured nature of clinical notes as opposed to other domains\nwhere massive training data come in structured or semi-structured form.\nFurther, one of the least explored and critical components of clinical text\nsummarization is factual accuracy of clinical summaries. This is specifically\ncrucial in the healthcare domain, cardiology in particular, where an accurate\nsummary generation that preserves the facts in the source notes is critical to\nthe well-being of a patient. In this study, we propose a framework for\nimproving the factual accuracy of abstractive summarization of clinical text\nusing knowledge-guided multi-objective optimization. We propose to jointly\noptimize three cost functions in our proposed architecture during training:\ngenerative loss, entity loss and knowledge loss and evaluate the proposed\narchitecture on 1) clinical notes of patients with heart failure (HF), which we\ncollect for this study; and 2) two benchmark datasets, Indiana University Chest\nX-ray collection (IU X-Ray), and MIMIC-CXR, that are publicly available. We\nexperiment with three transformer encoder-decoder architectures and demonstrate\nthat optimizing different loss functions leads to improved performance in terms\nof entity-level factual accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Recent works showed that end-to-end neural approaches tend to become very\npopular for spoken language understanding (SLU). Through the term end-to-end,\none considers the use of a single model optimized to extract semantic\ninformation directly from the speech signal. A major issue for such models is\nthe lack of paired audio and textual data with semantic annotation. In this\npaper, we propose an approach to build an end-to-end neural model to extract\nsemantic information in a scenario in which zero paired audio data is\navailable. Our approach is based on the use of an external model trained to\ngenerate a sequence of vectorial representations from text. These\nrepresentations mimic the hidden representations that could be generated inside\nan end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) model by processing a speech\nsignal. An SLU neural module is then trained using these representations as\ninput and the annotated text as output. Last, the SLU module replaces the top\nlayers of the ASR model to achieve the construction of the end-to-end model.\nOur experiments on named entity recognition, carried out on the QUAERO corpus,\nshow that this approach is very promising, getting better results than a\ncomparable cascade approach or than the use of synthetic voices.",

Development of automated systems that could process\nlegal documents and augment legal practitioners can mitigate this. However,\nthere is a dearth of high-quality corpora that is needed to develop such\ndata-driven systems. The problem gets even more pronounced in the case of low\nresource languages such as Hindi. In this resource paper, we introduce the\nHindi Legal Documents Corpus (HLDC), a corpus of more than 900K legal documents\nin Hindi. Documents are cleaned and structured to enable the development of\ndownstream applications. Further, as a use-case for the corpus, we introduce\nthe task of bail prediction. We experiment with a battery of models and propose\na Multi-Task Learning (MTL) based model for the same. MTL models use\nsummarization as an auxiliary task along with bail prediction as the main task.\nExperiments with different models are indicative of the need for further\nresearch in this area.

    "abstract": "Unbiased learning to rank has been proposed to alleviate the biases in the\nsearch ranking, making it possible to train ranking models with user\ninteraction data. In real applications, search engines are designed to display\nonly the most relevant k documents from the retrieved candidate set. The rest\ncandidates are discarded. As a consequence, position bias and sample selection\nbias usually occur simultaneously. Existing unbiased learning to rank\napproaches either focus on one type of bias (e.g., position bias) or mitigate\nthe position bias and sample selection bias with separate components,\noverlooking their associations. In this study, we first analyze the mechanisms\nand associations of position bias and sample selection bias from the viewpoint\nof a causal graph. Based on the analysis, we propose Causal Likelihood\nDecomposition (CLD), a unified approach to simultaneously mitigating these two\nbiases in top-k learning to rank. By decomposing the log-likelihood of the\nbiased data as an unbiased term that only related to relevance, plus other\nterms related to biases, CLD successfully detaches the relevance from position\nbias and sample selection bias. An unbiased ranking model can be obtained from\nthe unbiased term, via maximizing the whole likelihood. An extension to the\npairwise neural ranking is also developed. Advantages of CLD include\ntheoretical soundness and a unified framework for pointwise and pairwise\nunbiased top-k learning to rank. Extensive experimental results verified that\nCLD, including its pairwise neural extension, outperformed the baselines by\nmitigating both the position bias and the sample selection bias. Empirical\nstudies also showed that CLD is robust to the variation of bias severity and\nthe click noise.",

To solve this problem, we\npropose an effective phone mask training method for Conformer-based Uyghur\nend-to-end (E2E) speech recognition. The idea is to randomly mask off a certain\npercentage features of phones during model training, which simulates the above\nverbal phenomena and facilitates E2E model to learn more contextual\ninformation. According to experiments, the above issues can be greatly\nalleviated. In addition, deep investigations are carried out into different\nunits in masking, which shows the effectiveness of our proposed masking unit.\nWe also further study the masking method and optimize filling strategy of phone\nmask. Finally, compared with Conformer-based E2E baseline without mask\ntraining, our model demonstrates about 5.51% relative Word Error Rate (WER)\nreduction on reading speech and 12.92% on spontaneous speech, respectively.

    "abstract": "Deep models trained on source domain lack generalization when evaluated on\nunseen target domains with different data distributions. The problem becomes\neven more pronounced when we have no access to target domain samples for\nadaptation. In this paper, we address domain generalized semantic segmentation,\nwhere a segmentation model is trained to be domain-invariant without using any\ntarget domain data. Existing approaches to tackle this problem standardize data\ninto a unified distribution. We argue that while such a standardization\npromotes global normalization, the resulting features are not discriminative\nenough to get clear segmentation boundaries. To enhance separation between\ncategories while simultaneously promoting domain invariance, we propose a\nframework including two novel modules: Semantic-Aware Normalization (SAN) and\nSemantic-Aware Whitening (SAW). Specifically, SAN focuses on category-level\ncenter alignment between features from different image styles, while SAW\nenforces distributed alignment for the already center-aligned features. With\nthe help of SAN and SAW, we encourage both intra-category compactness and\ninter-category separability. We validate our approach through extensive\nexperiments on widely-used datasets (i.e. GTAV, SYNTHIA, Cityscapes, Mapillary\nand BDDS).

In addition, we introduce\nnovel pixel folding operations to further improve model efficiency while\nmaintaining pixel-wise prior knowledge for end-to-end regression. With these\ninnovative designs, we greatly reduce the expenditure of pixel synthesis, e.g.,\nreducing 90% computation and 57% parameters compared to the latest pixel\nsynthesis method called CIPS. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on two benchmark datasets, namely FFHQ and LSUN Church. The\nexperimental results show that with much less expenditure, PixelFolder obtains\nnew state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two benchmark datasets, i.e., 3.77\nFID and 2.45 FID on FFHQ and LSUN Church, respectively.

    "abstract": "Rotated object detection in aerial images is a meaningful yet challenging\ntask as objects are densely arranged and have arbitrary orientations. The\neight-parameter (coordinates of box vectors) methods in rotated object\ndetection usually use ln-norm losses (L1 loss, L2 loss, and smooth L1 loss) as\nloss functions. As ln-norm losses are mainly based on non-scale-invariant\nMinkowski distance, using ln-norm losses will lead to inconsistency with the\ndetection metric rotational Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and training\ninstability. To address the problems, we use Mahalanobis distance to calculate\nloss between the predicted and the target box vertices' vectors, proposing a\nnew loss function called Mahalanobis Distance Loss (MDL) for eight-parameter\nrotated object detection. As Mahalanobis distance is scale-invariant, MDL is\nmore consistent with detection metric than ln-norm losses and more stable\nduring training. To alleviate the problem of boundary discontinuity like all\nother eight-parameter methods, we further take the minimum loss value to make\nMDL continuous at boundary cases. We achieve state-of-art performance on\nDOTA-v1.0 with the proposed method MDL. Furthermore, with the comparative\nexperiment of smooth L1 loss under the same condi-tion, we find that MDL\nperforms better in rotated object detection.",

    "title": "Privacy-preserving Anomaly Detection in Cloud Manufacturing via  Federated Transformer",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of cloud manufacturing, industrial production with\nedge computing as the core architecture has been greatly developed. However,\nedge devices often suffer from abnormalities and failures in industrial\nproduction. Therefore, detecting these abnormal situations timely and\naccurately is crucial for cloud manufacturing. As such, a straightforward\nsolution is that the edge device uploads the data to the cloud for anomaly\ndetection. However, Industry 4.0 puts forward higher requirements for data\nprivacy and security so that it is unrealistic to upload data from edge devices\ndirectly to the cloud. Considering the above-mentioned severe challenges, this\npaper customizes a weakly-supervised edge computing anomaly detection\nframework, i.e., Federated Learning-based Transformer framework\n(\\textit{FedAnomaly}), to deal with the anomaly detection problem in cloud\nmanufacturing. Specifically, we introduce federated learning (FL) framework\nthat allows edge devices to train an anomaly detection model in collaboration\nwith the cloud without compromising privacy. To boost the privacy performance\nof the framework, we add differential privacy noise to the uploaded features.\nTo further improve the ability of edge devices to extract abnormal features, we\nuse the Transformer to extract the feature representation of abnormal data. In\nthis context, we design a novel collaborative learning protocol to promote\nefficient collaboration between FL and Transformer. Furthermore, extensive case\nstudies on four benchmark data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time integrating FL\nand Transformer to deal with anomaly detection problems in cloud manufacturing.",

As calculating Lipschitz constants is NP-hard, techniques\nfor estimating Lipschitz constants must navigate the trade-off between\nscalability and accuracy. In this work, we significantly push the scalability\nfrontier of a semidefinite programming technique known as LipSDP while\nachieving zero accuracy loss. We first show that LipSDP has chordal sparsity,\nwhich allows us to derive a chordally sparse formulation that we call\nChordal-LipSDP. The key benefit is that the main computational bottleneck of\nLipSDP, a large semidefinite constraint, is now decomposed into an equivalent\ncollection of smaller ones: allowing Chordal-LipSDP to outperform LipSDP\nparticularly as the network depth grows. Moreover, our formulation uses a\ntunable sparsity parameter that enables one to gain tighter estimates without\nincurring a significant computational cost. We illustrate the scalability of\nour approach through extensive numerical experiments.",

    "abstract": "Private and public organizations regularly collect and analyze digitalized\ndata about their associates, volunteers, clients, etc. However, because most\npersonal data are sensitive, there is a key challenge in designing\nprivacy-preserving systems. To tackle privacy concerns, research communities\nhave proposed different methods to preserve privacy, with Differential privacy\n(DP) standing out as a formal definition that allows quantifying the\nprivacy-utility trade-off. Besides, with the local DP (LDP) model, users can\nsanitize their data locally before transmitting it to the server. The objective\nof this thesis is thus two-fold: O$_1$) To improve the utility and privacy in\nmultiple frequency estimates under LDP guarantees, which is fundamental to\nstatistical learning. And O$_2$) To assess the privacy-utility trade-off of\nmachine learning (ML) models trained over differentially private data. For\nO$_1$, we first tackled the problem from two \"multiple\" perspectives, i.e.,\nmultiple attributes and multiple collections throughout time, while focusing on\nutility. Secondly, we focused our attention on the multiple attributes aspect\nonly, in which we proposed a solution focusing on privacy while preserving\nutility. In both cases, we demonstrate through analytical and experimental\nvalidations the advantages of our proposed solutions over state-of-the-art LDP\nprotocols. For O$_2$, we empirically evaluated ML-based solutions designed to\nsolve real-world problems while ensuring DP guarantees. Indeed, we mainly used\nthe input data perturbation setting from the privacy-preserving ML literature.\nThis is the situation in which the whole dataset is sanitized independently\nand, thus, we implemented LDP algorithms from the perspective of the\ncentralized data owner. In all cases, we concluded that differentially private\nML models achieve nearly the same utility metrics as non-private ones.",

A core aspect of UrbanFly\nis its ability to robustly plan directly on the sparse point clouds generated\nby a Monocular Visual Inertial SLAM (VINS) backend. It achieves this by using\nthe sparse point clouds to build an uncertainty-integrated cuboid\nrepresentation of the environment through a data-driven monocular plane\nsegmentation network. Our chosen world model provides faster distance queries\nthan the more common voxel-grid representation, and UrbanFly leverages this\ncapability in two different ways leading to as many trajectory optimizers. The\nfirst optimizer uses a gradient-free cross-entropy method to compute\ntrajectories that minimize collision probability and smoothness cost. Our\nsecond optimizer is a simplified version of the first and uses a sequential\nconvex programming optimizer initialized based on probabilistic safety\nestimates on a set of randomly drawn trajectories. Both our trajectory\noptimizers are made computationally tractable and independent of the nature of\nunderlying uncertainty by embedding the distribution of collision violations in\nReproducing Kernel Hilbert Space.

    "abstract": "We present a novel approach to differential cost analysis that, given a\nprogram revision, attempts to statically bound the difference in resource\nusage, or cost, between the two program versions. Differential cost analysis is\nparticularly interesting because of the many compelling applications for it,\nsuch as detecting resource-use regressions at code-review time or proving the\nabsence of certain side-channel vulnerabilities. One prior approach to\ndifferential cost analysis is to apply relational reasoning that conceptually\nconstructs a product program on which one can over-approximate the difference\nin costs between the two program versions. However, a significant challenge in\nany relational approach is effectively aligning the program versions to get\nprecise results. In this paper, our key insight is that we can avoid the need\nfor and the limitations of program alignment if, instead, we bound the\ndifference of two cost-bound summaries rather than directly bounding the\nconcrete cost difference. In particular, our method computes a threshold value\nfor the maximal difference in cost between two program versions simultaneously\nusing two kinds of cost-bound summaries -- a potential function that evaluates\nto an upper bound for the cost incurred in the first program and an\nanti-potential function that evaluates to a lower bound for the cost incurred\nin the second. Our method has a number of desirable properties: it can be fully\nautomated, it allows optimizing the threshold value on relative cost, it is\nsuitable for programs that are not syntactically similar, and it supports\nnon-determinism. We have evaluated an implementation of our approach on a\nnumber of program pairs collected from the literature, and we find that our\nmethod computes tight threshold values on relative cost in most examples.",

By unifying publications\nand venues under a common multilayer network structure made up of citing and\npublishing relationships, classifications at the venue-level can be augmented\nwith publication-level classifications. We evaluate SciNoBo on a publications'\ndataset extracted from Microsoft Academic Graph and we perform a comparative\nanalysis against a state-of-the-art neural-network baseline. The results reveal\nthat our proposed system is capable of producing high-quality classifications\nof publications.",

    "abstract": "Prompting methods recently achieve impressive success in few-shot learning.\nThese methods modify input samples with prompt sentence pieces, and decode\nlabel tokens to map samples to corresponding labels. However, such a paradigm\nis very inefficient for the task of slot tagging. Since slot tagging samples\nare multiple consecutive words in a sentence, the prompting methods have to\nenumerate all n-grams token spans to find all the possible slots, which greatly\nslows down the prediction. To tackle this, we introduce an inverse paradigm for\nprompting. Different from the classic prompts mapping tokens to labels, we\nreversely predict slot values given slot types. Such inverse prompting only\nrequires a one-turn prediction for each slot type and greatly speeds up the\nprediction. Besides, we propose a novel Iterative Prediction Strategy, from\nwhich the model learns to refine predictions by considering the relations\nbetween different slot types. We find, somewhat surprisingly, the proposed\nmethod not only predicts faster but also significantly improves the effect\n(improve over 6.1 F1-scores on 10-shot setting) and achieves new\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "A series of unsupervised video-based re-identification (re-ID) methods have\nbeen proposed to solve the problem of high labor cost required to annotate\nre-ID datasets. But their performance is still far lower than the supervised\ncounterparts. In the mean time, clean datasets without noise are used in these\nmethods, which is not realistic. In this paper, we propose to tackle this\nproblem by learning re-ID models from automatically generated person tracklets\nby multiple objects tracking (MOT) algorithm. To this end, we design a\ntracklet-based multi-level clustering (TMC) framework to effectively learn the\nre-ID model from the noisy person tracklets. First, intra-tracklet isolation to\nreduce ID switch noise within tracklets; second, alternates between using\ninter-tracklet association to eliminate ID fragmentation noise and network\ntraining using the pseudo label. Extensive experiments on MARS with various\nmanually generated noises show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.\nSpecifically, the proposed framework achieved mAP 53.4% and rank-1 63.7% on the\nsimulated tracklets with strongest noise, even outperforming the best existing\nmethod on clean tracklets. Based on the results, we believe that building re-ID\nmodels from automatically generated noisy tracklets is a reasonable approach\nand will also be an important way to make re-ID models feasible in real-world\napplications.",

We make two key contributions. First, we design efficient SpMV\nalgorithms to accelerate the SpMV kernel in current and future PIM systems,\nwhile covering a wide variety of sparse matrices with diverse sparsity\npatterns.

However, existing circle\nextraction methods either are sensitive to the quality of raw point clouds when\nclassifying circle-boundary points, or require well-designed fitting functions\nwhen regressing circle parameters. To relieve the challenges, we propose an\nend-to-end Point Cloud Circle Algebraic Fitting Network (Circle-Net) based on a\nsynergy of deep circle-boundary point feature learning and weighted algebraic\nfitting. First, we design a circle-boundary learning module, which considers\nlocal and global neighboring contexts of each point, to detect all potential\ncircle-boundary points. Second, we develop a deep feature based circle\nparameter learning module for weighted algebraic fitting, without designing any\nweight metric, to avoid the influence of outliers during fitting. Unlike most\nof the cutting-edge circle extraction wisdoms, the proposed\nclassification-and-fitting modules are originally co-trained with a\ncomprehensive loss to enhance the quality of extracted circles.Comparisons on\nthe established dataset and real-scanned point clouds exhibit clear\nimprovements of Circle-Net over SOTAs in terms of both noise-robustness and\nextraction accuracy.

    "abstract": "Verification planning is a sequential decision-making problem that specifies\na set of verification activities (VA) and correction activities (CA) at\ndifferent phases of system development. While VAs are used to identify errors\nand defects, CAs also play important roles in system verification as they\ncorrect the identified errors and defects. However, current planning methods\nonly consider VAs as decision choices. Because VAs and CAs have different\nactivity spaces, planning a joint verification-correction strategy (JVCS) is\nstill challenging, especially for large-size systems. Here we introduce a\nUCB-based tree search approach to search for near-optimal JVCSs. First,\nverification planning is simplified as repeatable bandit problems and an upper\nconfidence bound rule for repeatable bandits (UCBRB) is presented with the\noptimal regret bound. Next, a tree search algorithm is proposed to search for\nfeasible JVCSs. A tree-based ensemble learning model is also used to extend the\ntree search algorithm to handle local optimality issues.

    "abstract": "Users who come to recommendation platforms are heterogeneous in activity\nlevels. There usually exists a group of core users who visit the platform\nregularly and consume a large body of content upon each visit, while others are\ncasual users who tend to visit the platform occasionally and consume less each\ntime. As a result, consumption activities from core users often dominate the\ntraining data used for learning. As core users can exhibit different activity\npatterns from casual users, recommender systems trained on historical user\nactivity data usually achieve much worse performance on casual users than core\nusers. To bridge the gap, we propose a model-agnostic framework L2Aug to\nimprove recommendations for casual users through data augmentation, without\nsacrificing core user experience. L2Aug is powered by a data augmentor that\nlearns to generate augmented interaction sequences, in order to fine-tune and\noptimize the performance of the recommendation system for casual users. On four\nreal-world public datasets, L2Aug outperforms other treatment methods and\nachieves the best sequential recommendation performance for both casual and\ncore users. We also test L2Aug in an online simulation environment with\nreal-time feedback to further validate its efficacy, and showcase its\nflexibility in supporting different augmentation actions.",

    "abstract": "Despite the rapid development of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), the necessity\nof dense covers largely prohibits its wider applications. While several recent\nworks have attempted to address this issue, they either operate with sparse\nviews (yet still, a few of them) or on simple objects/scenes. In this work, we\nconsider a more ambitious task: training neural radiance field, over\nrealistically complex visual scenes, by \"looking only once\", i.e., using only a\nsingle view. To attain this goal, we present a Single View NeRF (SinNeRF)\nframework consisting of thoughtfully designed semantic and geometry\nregularizations. Specifically, SinNeRF constructs a semi-supervised learning\nprocess, where we introduce and propagate geometry pseudo labels and semantic\npseudo labels to guide the progressive training process. Extensive experiments\nare conducted on complex scene benchmarks, including NeRF synthetic dataset,\nLocal Light Field Fusion dataset, and DTU dataset. We show that even without\npre-training on multi-view datasets, SinNeRF can yield photo-realistic\nnovel-view synthesis results. Under the single image setting, SinNeRF\nsignificantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art NeRF baselines in all\ncases. Project page: https://vita-group.github.io/SinNeRF/",

In this work, we take a step back to analyze how the human\ncapability to anticipate the future can be transferred to machine learning\nalgorithms. To incorporate this ability in intelligent systems a question worth\npondering upon is how exactly do we anticipate? Is it by anticipating future\nactions from past experiences? Or is it by simulating possible scenarios based\non cues from the present? A recent study on human psychology explains that, in\nanticipating an occurrence, the human brain counts on both systems. In this\nwork, we study the impact of each system for the task of action anticipation\nand introduce a paradigm to integrate them in a learning framework. We believe\nthat intelligent systems designed by leveraging the psychological anticipation\nmodels will do a more nuanced job at the task of human action prediction.\nFurthermore, we introduce cyclic transformation in the temporal dimension in\nfeature and semantic label space to instill the human ability of reasoning of\npast actions based on the predicted future.

    "abstract": "Dynamic language features are widely available in programming languages to\nimplement functionality that can adapt to multiple usage contexts, enabling\nreuse. Functionality such as data binding , object-relational mapping and user\ninterface builders can be heavily dependent on these features. However, their\nuse has risks and downsides as they affect the soundness of static analyses and\ntechniques that rely on such analyses (such as bug detection and automated\nprogram repair). They can also make software more error-prone due to potential\ndifficulties in understanding reflective code, loss of compile-time safety and\nincorrect API usage. In this paper, we set out to quantify some of the effects\nof using dynamic language features in Java programs-that is, the\nerror-proneness of using those features with respect to a particular type of\nbug known as single statement bugs. By mining 2,024 GitHub projects, we found\n139 single statement bug instances (falling under 10 different bug patterns),\nwith the highest number of bugs belonging to three specific patterns: Wrong\nFunction Name, Same Function More Args and Change Identifier Used. These\nresults can help practitioners to quantify the risk of using dynamic techniques\nover alternatives (such as code generation). We hope this classification raises\nattention on choosing dynamic APIs that are likely to be error-prone, and\nprovides developers a better understanding when designing bug detection tools\nfor such feature.",

Advances in margin-based loss functions\nhave resulted in enhanced discriminability of faces in the embedding space.\nFurther, previous studies have studied the effect of adaptive losses to assign\nmore importance to misclassified (hard) examples.

    "abstract": "Most computer vision systems assume distortion-free images as inputs. The\nwidely used rolling-shutter (RS) image sensors, however, suffer from geometric\ndistortion when the camera and object undergo motion during capture. Extensive\nresearches have been conducted on correcting RS distortions. However, most of\nthe existing work relies heavily on the prior assumptions of scenes or motions.\nBesides, the motion estimation steps are either oversimplified or\ncomputationally inefficient due to the heavy flow warping, limiting their\napplicability. In this paper, we investigate using rolling shutter with a\nglobal reset feature (RSGR) to restore clean global shutter (GS) videos. This\nfeature enables us to turn the rectification problem into a deblur-like one,\ngetting rid of inaccurate and costly explicit motion estimation. First, we\nbuild an optic system that captures paired RSGR/GS videos. Second, we develop a\nnovel algorithm incorporating spatial and temporal designs to correct the\nspatial-varying RSGR distortion. Third, we demonstrate that existing\nimage-to-image translation algorithms can recover clean GS videos from\ndistorted RSGR inputs, yet our algorithm achieves the best performance with the\nspecific designs. Our rendered results are not only visually appealing but also\nbeneficial to downstream tasks. Compared to the state-of-the-art RS solution,\nour RSGR solution is superior in both effectiveness and efficiency.

    "abstract": "Web phishing remains a serious cyber threat responsible for most data\nbreaches. Machine Learning (ML)-based anti-phishing detectors are seen as an\neffective countermeasure, and are increasingly adopted by web-browsers and\nsoftware products. However, with an average of 10K phishing links reported per\nhour to platforms such as PhishTank and VirusTotal (VT), the deficiencies of\nsuch ML-based solutions are laid bare. We first explore how phishing sites\nbypass ML-based detection with a deep dive into 13K phishing pages targeting\nmajor brands such as Facebook. Results show successful evasion is caused by:\n(1) use of benign services to obscure phishing URLs; (2) high similarity\nbetween the HTML structures of phishing and benign pages; (3) hiding the\nultimate phishing content within Javascript and running such scripts only on\nthe client; (4) looking beyond typical credentials and credit cards for new\ncontent such as IDs and documents; (5) hiding phishing content until after\nhuman interaction. We attribute the root cause to the dependency of ML-based\nmodels on the vertical feature space (webpage content). These solutions rely\nonly on what phishers present within the page itself. Thus, we propose\nAnti-SubtlePhish, a more resilient model based on logistic regression. The key\naugmentation is the inclusion of a horizontal feature space, which examines\ncorrelation variables between the final render of suspicious pages against what\ntrusted services have recorded (e.g., PageRank). To defeat (1) and (2), we\ncorrelate information between WHOIS, PageRank, and page analytics. To combat\n(3), (4) and (5), we correlate features after rendering the page. Experiments\nwith 100K phishing/benign sites show promising accuracy (98.8%).

Recently, some methods reformulate it as a\nclassification-regression task to boost the model performance, where continuous\ndepth is estimated via a linear combination of predicted probability\ndistributions and discrete bins. In this paper, we present a novel framework\ncalled BinsFormer, tailored for the classification-regression-based depth\nestimation. It mainly focuses on two crucial components in the specific task:\n1) proper generation of adaptive bins and 2) sufficient interaction between\nprobability distribution and bins predictions. To specify, we employ the\nTransformer decoder to generate bins, novelly viewing it as a direct set-to-set\nprediction problem. We further integrate a multi-scale decoder structure to\nachieve a comprehensive understanding of spatial geometry information and\nestimate depth maps in a coarse-to-fine manner. Moreover, an extra scene\nunderstanding query is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy, which turns\nout that models can implicitly learn useful information from an auxiliary\nenvironment classification task.

Most prior research, however, focused on either one single platform\nor one single political topic. Whether an ideological group garners more\nattention across platforms and topics, and how the attention dynamics evolve\nover time, have not been explored. In this work, we present a quantitative\nstudy that links collective attention across two social media platforms --\nYouTube and Twitter, centered on online activities surrounding videos of three\ncontroversial political topics including Abortion, Gun control, and Black Lives\nMatter over 16 months. We propose several video-centric metrics to characterize\nhow online attention is accumulated for different ideological groups. We find\nthat neither side is on a winning streak: left-leaning videos are overall more\nviewed, more engaging, but less tweeted than right-leaning videos. The\nattention time series unfold quicker for left-leaning videos, but span a longer\ntime for right-leaning videos. Network analysis on the early adopters and tweet\ncascades show that the information diffusion for left-leaning videos tends to\ninvolve centralized actors; while that for right-leaning videos starts earlier\nin the attention lifecycle.

    "abstract": "Recently, the pre-training paradigm combining Transformer and masked language\nmodeling has achieved tremendous success in NLP, images, and point clouds, such\nas BERT. However, directly extending BERT from NLP to point clouds requires\ntraining a fixed discrete Variational AutoEncoder (dVAE) before pre-training,\nwhich results in a complex two-stage method called Point-BERT. Inspired by BERT\nand MoCo, we propose POS-BERT, a one-stage BERT pre-training method for point\nclouds. Specifically, we use the mask patch modeling (MPM) task to perform\npoint cloud pre-training, which aims to recover masked patches information\nunder the supervision of the corresponding tokenizer output. Unlike Point-BERT,\nits tokenizer is extra-trained and frozen. We propose to use the dynamically\nupdated momentum encoder as the tokenizer, which is updated and outputs the\ndynamic supervision signal along with the training process. Further, in order\nto learn high-level semantic representation, we combine contrastive learning to\nmaximize the class token consistency between different transformation point\nclouds. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that POS-BERT can extract\nhigh-quality pre-training features and promote downstream tasks to improve\nperformance. Using the pre-training model without any fine-tuning to extract\nfeatures and train linear SVM on ModelNet40, POS-BERT achieves the\nstate-of-the-art classification accuracy, which exceeds Point-BERT by 3.5\\%. In\naddition, our approach has significantly improved many downstream tasks, such\nas fine-tuned classification, few-shot classification, part segmentation.

    "title": "Improving Vision Transformers by Revisiting High-frequency Components",
    "abstract": "The transformer models have shown promising effectiveness in dealing with\nvarious vision tasks. However, compared with training Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) models, training Vision Transformer (ViT) models is more\ndifficult and relies on the large-scale training set. To explain this\nobservation we make a hypothesis that ViT models are less effective in\ncapturing the high-frequency components of images than CNN models, and verify\nit by a frequency analysis. Inspired by this finding, we first investigate the\neffects of existing techniques for improving ViT models from a new frequency\nperspective, and find that the success of some techniques (e.g., RandAugment)\ncan be attributed to the better usage of the high-frequency components. Then,\nto compensate for this insufficient ability of ViT models, we propose HAT,\nwhich directly augments high-frequency components of images via adversarial\ntraining. We show that HAT can consistently boost the performance of various\nViT models (e.g., +1.2% for ViT-B, +0.5% for Swin-B), and especially enhance\nthe advanced model VOLO-D5 to 87.3% that only uses ImageNet-1K data, and the\nsuperiority can also be maintained on out-of-distribution data and transferred\nto downstream tasks.",

Existing methods focus on performing repetitive action\ncounting in short videos, which is tough for dealing with longer videos in more\nrealistic scenarios.

To complement this margin, we introduce a new large-scale repetitive\naction counting dataset covering a wide variety of video lengths, along with\nmore realistic situations where action interruption or action inconsistencies\noccur in the video. Besides, we also provide a fine-grained annotation of the\naction cycles instead of just counting annotation along with a numerical value.\nSuch a dataset contains 1,451 videos with about 20,000 annotations, which is\nmore challenging. For repetitive action counting towards more realistic\nscenarios, we further propose encoding multi-scale temporal correlation with\ntransformers that can take into account both performance and efficiency.\nFurthermore, with the help of fine-grained annotation of action cycles, we\npropose a density map regression-based method to predict the action period,\nwhich yields better performance with sufficient interpretability.

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has a great potential for solving complex\ndecision-making problems in autonomous driving, especially in mixed-traffic\nscenarios where autonomous vehicles and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) drive\ntogether. Safety is a key during both the learning and deploying reinforcement\nlearning (RL) algorithms process. In this paper, we formulate the on-ramp\nmerging as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and solve it with an\noff-policy RL algorithm, i.e., Soft Actor-Critic for Discrete Action Settings\n(SAC-Discrete). In addition, a motion predictive safety controller including a\nmotion predictor and an action substitution module, is proposed to ensure\ndriving safety during both training and testing. The motion predictor estimates\nthe trajectories of the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles from kinematic\nmodels, and predicts potential collisions. The action substitution module\nupdates the actions based on safety distance and replaces risky actions, before\nsending them to the low-level controller. We train, evaluate and test our\napproach on a gym-like highway simulation with three different levels of\ntraffic modes. The simulation results show that even in harder traffic\ndensities, our proposed method still significantly reduces collision rate while\nmaintaining high efficiency, outperforming several state-of-the-art baselines\nin the considered on-ramp merging scenarios.

To achieve this, a key step is garment warping which spatially\naligns the target garment with the corresponding body parts in the person\nimage.

To overcome this limitation, a novel global appearance\nflow estimation model is proposed in this work. For the first time, a StyleGAN\nbased architecture is adopted for appearance flow estimation. This enables us\nto take advantage of a global style vector to encode a whole-image context to\ncope with the aforementioned challenges. To guide the StyleGAN flow generator\nto pay more attention to local garment deformation, a flow refinement module is\nintroduced to add local context. Experiment results on a popular virtual try-on\nbenchmark show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance. It is\nparticularly effective in a `in-the-wild' application scenario where the\nreference image is full-body resulting in a large mis-alignment with the\ngarment image (Fig.~\\ref{fig:fig1} Top).

    "title": "A Differentially Private Framework for Deep Learning with Convexified  Loss Functions",
    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) has been applied in deep learning for preserving\nprivacy of the underlying training sets. Existing DP practice falls into three\ncategories - objective perturbation, gradient perturbation and output\nperturbation. They suffer from three main problems. First, conditions on\nobjective functions limit objective perturbation in general deep learning\ntasks. Second, gradient perturbation does not achieve a satisfactory\nprivacy-utility trade-off due to over-injected noise in each epoch. Third, high\nutility of the output perturbation method is not guaranteed because of the\nloose upper bound on the global sensitivity of the trained model parameters as\nthe noise scale parameter. To address these problems, we analyse a tighter\nupper bound on the global sensitivity of the model parameters. Under a\nblack-box setting, based on this global sensitivity, to control the overall\nnoise injection, we propose a novel output perturbation framework by injecting\nDP noise into a randomly sampled neuron (via the exponential mechanism) at the\noutput layer of a baseline non-private neural network trained with a\nconvexified loss function. We empirically compare the privacy-utility\ntrade-off, measured by accuracy loss to baseline non-private models and the\nprivacy leakage against black-box membership inference (MI) attacks, between\nour framework and the open-source differentially private stochastic gradient\ndescent (DP-SGD) approaches on six commonly used real-world datasets. The\nexperimental evaluations show that, when the baseline models have observable\nprivacy leakage under MI attacks, our framework achieves a better\nprivacy-utility trade-off than existing DP-SGD implementations, given an\noverall privacy budget $\\epsilon \\leq 1$ for a large number of queries.",

These biases may impair a\nmodel's generalizability, rendering it ineffective for OD in novel and unseen\ndatasets.

A simple yet effective OD\nframework for studying bias mitigation is proposed. Using this framework, the\nperformance on popular datasets is analyzed and a significant difference in\nmodel performance is observed.

This renders the control and optimization of such systems a\ncomplex task due to their nonlinear behaviour. Additionally, standard methods\nsuch as linearizing around a fixed point may not be an effective strategy for\nmany systems, thus requiring an alternative approach. For this reason, we\npropose a new deep learning framework to discover a transformation of a\nnonlinear dynamical system to an equivalent higher dimensional linear\nrepresentation. We demonstrate that the resulting learned linear representation\naccurately captures the dynamics of the original system for a wider range of\nconditions than standard linearization. As a result of this, we show that the\nlearned linear model can subsequently be used for the successful control of the\noriginal system.

    "abstract": "This article concerns the weak Galerkin mixed finite element method (WG-MFEM)\nfor second order elliptic equations on 2D domains with curved boundary. The\nNeumann boundary condition is considered since it becomes the essential\nboundary condition in this case. It is well-known that the discrepancy between\nthe curved physical domain and the polygonal approximation domain leads to a\nloss of accuracy for discretization with polynomial order $\\alpha>1$. The\npurpose of this paper is two-fold. First, we present a detailed error analysis\nof the original WG-MFEM for solving problems on curved domains, which exhibits\nan $O(h^{1/2})$ convergence for all $\\alpha\\ge 1$. It is a little surprising to\nsee that even the lowest-order WG-MFEM ($\\alpha=1$) experiences a loss of\naccuracy. This is different from known results for the finite element method\n(FEM) or the mixed FEM, and appears to be a combined effect of the WG-MFEM\ndesign and the fact that the outward normal vector on the polygonal\napproximation domain is different from the one on the curved domain. Second, we\npropose a remedy to bring the approximation rate back to optimal by employing\ntwo techniques. One is a specially designed boundary correction technique. The\nother is to take full advantage of the nice feature that weak Galerkin\ndiscretization can be defined on polygonal meshes, which allows the curved\nboundary to be better approximated by multiple short edges without increasing\nthe total number of mesh elements. Rigorous analysis shows that a combination\nof the above two techniques renders optimal convergence for all $\\alpha$.\nNumerical results further confirm this conclusion.",

A clear and thorough understanding of\na dataset's origins, development, intent, ethical considerations and evolution\nbecomes a necessary step for the responsible and informed deployment of models,\nespecially those in people-facing contexts and high-risk domains.

The objective of data collection is to deploy\nthe collected data in developing decision support systems for performance\nevaluation, problem identification, and production control. The goal of this\ndissertation is to investigate how the collected data can be used to evaluate\nperformance and optimize manufacturing systems, analytically and empirically.\nIn the first part of the thesis, I investigate how can the collected data from\nthe shop-floor be used in the efficient control and design of manufacturing\nsystems? To investigate the impact of possible dependency in the inter-event\ntimes on the optimal control and performance measures of the system, a\nmanufacturing system that is controlled by using a single-threshold production\ncontrol policy is analyzed. It is shown that ignoring autocorrelation in\ninter-arrival or service times leads to overestimation (underestimation) of the\noptimal threshold level for negatively (positively) correlated processes. Then,\nit is shown that the optimal control policy of a production/inventory system\nwith correlated inter-arrival and service times modeled as Markovian Arrival\nProcesses is a state-dependent threshold policy. In the second part of the\nthesis, an exploratory data analysis is conducted by using a large industrial\ndataset related to the flow of the products at a semiconductor wafer\nfabrication. Then, the cycle times of the products are predicted using Machine\nLearning methods, and the performance of different prediction algorithms is\nassessed.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the fact that many relations cross the sentence boundary, there\nhas been increasing interest in document-level relation extraction (DocRE).\nDocRE requires integrating information within and across sentences, capturing\ncomplex interactions between mentions of entities. Most existing methods are\npipeline-based, requiring entities as input. However, jointly learning to\nextract entities and relations can improve performance and be more efficient\ndue to shared parameters and training steps. In this paper, we develop a\nsequence-to-sequence approach, seq2rel, that can learn the subtasks of DocRE\n(entity extraction, coreference resolution and relation extraction) end-to-end,\nreplacing a pipeline of task-specific components. Using a simple strategy we\ncall entity hinting, we compare our approach to existing pipeline-based methods\non several popular biomedical datasets, in some cases exceeding their\nperformance. We also report the first end-to-end results on these datasets for\nfuture comparison. Finally, we demonstrate that, under our model, an end-to-end\napproach outperforms a pipeline-based approach.

While previous work has shown that\nadversarially-trained image classifiers can be used to perform image synthesis,\nwe have yet to understand how best to leverage an adversarially-trained\nsegmentation network to do the same.

Our experiments demonstrate that\nadversarially-trained segmentation networks are more robust and indeed exhibit\nperceptually-aligned gradients which help in producing plausible image\ninpaintings.

This poses a significant\nbarrier to accounting for privacy risk and utility under logistical constraints\nimposed on data curators, especially those working with official statistics.

    "abstract": "The lifestyles of urban dwellers could reveal important insights regarding\nthe dynamics and complexity of cities. Despite growing research on analysis of\nlifestyle patterns in cities, little is known about the characteristics of\npeople's lifestyles patterns at urban scale. This limitation is primarily due\nto challenges in characterizing lifestyle patterns when human movement data is\naggregated to protect the privacy of users. In this study, we model cities\nbased on aggregated human visitation data to construct a network of places. We\nthen examine the subgraph signatures in the networks of places to map and\ncharacterize lifestyle patterns at city scale. Location-based data from Harris\nCounty, Dallas County, New York County, and Broward County in the United States\nwere examined to reveal lifestyle signatures in cities. For the motif analysis,\ntwo-node, three-node, and four-node motifs without location attributes were\nextracted from human visitation networks. Second, homogenized nodes in motifs\nwere encoded with location categories from NAICS codes. Multiple statistical\nmeasures, including network metrics and motif properties, were quantified to\ncharacterize lifestyle signatures. The results show that: people's lifestyles\nin urban environments can be well depicted and quantified based on distribution\nand attributes of motifs in networks of places; motifs in networks of places\nshow stability in quantity and distance as well as periodicity on weekends and\nweekdays indicating the stability of lifestyle patterns in cities; human\nvisitation networks and lifestyle patterns show similarities across different\nmetropolitan areas implying the universality of lifestyle signatures across\ncities. The findings provide deeper insights into urban lifestyles signatures\nin urban studies and provide important insights for data-informed urban\nplanning and management.",

First, we reformulate the chance state constraints\nas deterministic constraints depending only on explicit noise statistics. Based\non these reformulated constraints, we design a distributionally robust and\nrobustly stable benchmark SMPC algorithm for the ideal setting of known noise\nstatistics. Then, we employ this benchmark controller to derive a novel\nrobustly stable adaptive SMPC scheme that learns the necessary noise statistics\nonline, while guaranteeing time-uniform satisfaction of the unknown\nreformulated state constraints with high probability. The latter is achieved\nthrough the use of confidence intervals which rely on the empirical noise\nstatistics and are valid uniformly over time. Moreover, control performance is\nimproved over time as more noise samples are gathered and better estimates of\nthe noise statistics are obtained, given the online adaptation of the estimated\nreformulated constraints.

This raises the question: can\nreal datasets be enhanced with 3D rendered data? We investigate this question.\nIn this paper we demonstrate the use of 3D rendered data, procedural, data for\nthe adjustment of bias in image datasets. We perform error analysis of images\nof animals which shows that the misclassification of some animal breeds is\nlargely a data issue. We then create procedural images of the poorly classified\nbreeds and that model further trained on procedural data can better classify\npoorly performing breeds on real data. We believe that this approach can be\nused for the enhancement of visual data for any underrepresented group,\nincluding rare diseases, or any data bias potentially improving the accuracy\nand fairness of models. We find that the resulting representations rival or\neven out-perform those learned directly from real data, but that good\nperformance requires care in the 3D rendered procedural data generation. 3D\nimage dataset can be viewed as a compressed and organized copy of a real\ndataset, and we envision a future where more and more procedural data\nproliferate while datasets become increasingly unwieldy, missing, or private.\nThis paper suggests several techniques for dealing with visual representation\nlearning in such a future.",

In this context, investigating and\noptimizing the airflow in urban environments is critical to design comfortable\noutdoor areas as unwanted effects such as windy areas and the formation of heat\npockets have to be avoided. Our UrbanFlow framework enables interactive\narchitectural design allowing for decision making based on simulating urban\nflow. Compared to real-time fluid flow simulation, enabling interactive\narchitecture design poses an even higher computational efficiency challenge as\nevaluating a design by simulation usually requires hundreds of time steps. This\nis addressed based on a highly efficient Eulerian fluid simulator in which we\nincorporate a unified porosity model which is devised to encode digital urban\nmodels containing objects such as buildings and trees. UrbanFlow is equipped\nwith an optimization routine enabling the direct computation of design\nadaptations improving livability and comfort for given parameterized\narchitectural designs. To ensure convergence of the optimization process,\ninstead of the classical Navier-Stokes equations, the Reynolds-averaged\nNavier-Stokes equations are solved as this can be done on a relatively coarse\ngrid and allows for the decoupling of the effects of turbulent eddies which are\ntaken into account using a separate turbulence model.

Aiming to complement the traditional approach\nin computer science, which analyzes the performance of algorithms based on\nworst-case instances, this line of work has focused on the design and analysis\nof algorithms that are enhanced with machine-learned predictions regarding the\noptimal solution. The algorithms can use the predictions as a guide to inform\ntheir decisions, and the goal is to achieve much stronger performance\nguarantees when these predictions are accurate (consistency), while also\nmaintaining near-optimal worst-case guarantees, even if these predictions are\nvery inaccurate (robustness). So far, these results have been limited to\nalgorithms, but in this work we argue that another fertile ground for this\nframework is in mechanism design.\nWe initiate the design and analysis of strategyproof mechanisms that are\naugmented with predictions regarding the private information of the\nparticipating agents. To exhibit the important benefits of this approach, we\nrevisit the canonical problem of facility location with strategic agents in the\ntwo-dimensional Euclidean space. We study both the egalitarian and utilitarian\nsocial cost functions, and we propose new strategyproof mechanisms that\nleverage predictions to guarantee an optimal trade-off between consistency and\nrobustness guarantees.

Although methods based on Truncated\nSigned Distance Function (TSDF) Fusion have advanced the field over the years,\nthe TSDF volume representation is confronted with striking a balance between\nthe robustness to noisy measurements and maintaining the level of detail. We\npresent Bi-level Neural Volume Fusion (BNV-Fusion), which leverages recent\nadvances in neural implicit representations and neural rendering for dense 3D\nreconstruction. In order to incrementally integrate new depth maps into a\nglobal neural implicit representation, we propose a novel bi-level fusion\nstrategy that considers both efficiency and reconstruction quality by design.\nWe evaluate the proposed method on multiple datasets quantitatively and\nqualitatively, demonstrating a significant improvement over existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Despite the rapid advancement of navigation algorithms, mobile robots often\nproduce anomalous behaviors that can lead to navigation failures. The ability\nto detect such anomalous behaviors is a key component in modern robots to\nachieve high-levels of autonomy. Reactive anomaly detection methods identify\nanomalous task executions based on the current robot state and thus lack the\nability to alert the robot before an actual failure occurs. Such an alert delay\nis undesirable due to the potential damage to both the robot and the\nsurrounding objects. We propose a proactive anomaly detection network (PAAD)\nfor robot navigation in unstructured and uncertain environments. PAAD predicts\nthe probability of future failure based on the planned motions from the\npredictive controller and the current observation from the perception module.\nMulti-sensor signals are fused effectively to provide robust anomaly detection\nin the presence of sensor occlusion as seen in field environments. Our\nexperiments on field robot data demonstrates superior failure identification\nperformance than previous methods, and that our model can capture anomalous\nbehaviors in real-time while maintaining a low false detection rate in\ncluttered fields.

Adequate\nviews to the outside are one of the most cited indoor qualities related to\noccupant well-being. However, due to urbanization and densification trends,\ndesigners may have difficulties in providing vistas and views to the outside\nwith an assortment of content, which can support the needs of their occupants.\nTo better understand occupant view satisfaction and provide reliable design\nfeedback to architects, existing view satisfaction data must be expanded to\ncapture a wider variety of view scenarios and occupants. Most related research\nremains challenging in architectural practice due to a lack of easy-to-use\nearly-design analysis tools. However, early assessment of view can be\nadvantageous as design decisions in early design, such as building orientation,\nplan layout, and facade design, can improve the view quality. This paper,\nhence, presents results from a 181 participant view satisfaction survey with\n590 window views. The survey data is used to train a tree-regression model to\npredict view satisfaction. The prediction performance was compared to an\nexisting view assessment framework through case studies. The result showed that\nthe new prediction is more accurate to the surveyed result than the framework.\nFurther, the prediction performance was generally high for most responses,\nverifying the reliability. To facilitate view analysis in early design, this\npaper describes integrating the satisfaction prediction model and a ray-casting\ntool to compute view parameters in the CAD environment.",

    "abstract": "The conventional sliced Wasserstein is defined between two probability\nmeasures that have realizations as vectors. When comparing two probability\nmeasures over images, practitioners first need to vectorize images and then\nproject them to one-dimensional space by using matrix multiplication between\nthe sample matrix and the projection matrix. After that, the sliced Wasserstein\nis evaluated by averaging the two corresponding one-dimensional projected\nprobability measures. However, this approach has two limitations. The first\nlimitation is that the spatial structure of images is not captured efficiently\nby the vectorization step; therefore, the later slicing process becomes harder\nto gather the discrepancy information. The second limitation is memory\ninefficiency since each slicing direction is a vector that has the same\ndimension as the images. To address these limitations, we propose novel slicing\nmethods for sliced Wasserstein between probability measures over images that\nare based on the convolution operators. We derive convolution sliced\nWasserstein (CSW) and its variants via incorporating stride, dilation, and\nnon-linear activation function into the convolution operators. We investigate\nthe metricity of CSW as well as its sample complexity, its computational\ncomplexity, and its connection to conventional sliced Wasserstein distances.\nFinally, we demonstrate the favorable performance of CSW over the conventional\nsliced Wasserstein in comparing probability measures over images and in\ntraining deep generative modeling on images.",

    "title": "Detecting In-vehicle Intrusion via Semi-supervised Learning-based  Convolutional Adversarial Autoencoders",
    "abstract": "With the development of autonomous vehicle technology, the controller area\nnetwork (CAN) bus has become the de facto standard for an in-vehicle\ncommunication system because of its simplicity and efficiency. However, without\nany encryption and authentication mechanisms, the in-vehicle network using the\nCAN protocol is susceptible to a wide range of attacks. Many studies, which are\nmostly based on machine learning, have proposed installing an intrusion\ndetection system (IDS) for anomaly detection in the CAN bus system. Although\nmachine learning methods have many advantages for IDS, previous models usually\nrequire a large amount of labeled data, which results in high time and labor\ncosts. To handle this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised\nlearning-based convolutional adversarial autoencoder model in this paper. The\nproposed model combines two popular deep learning models: autoencoder and\ngenerative adversarial networks. First, the model is trained with unlabeled\ndata to learn the manifolds of normal and attack patterns. Then, only a small\nnumber of labeled samples are used in supervised training. The proposed model\ncan detect various kinds of message injection attacks, such as DoS, fuzzy, and\nspoofing, as well as unknown attacks. The experimental results show that the\nproposed model achieves the highest F1 score of 0.99 and a low error rate of\n0.1\\% with limited labeled data compared to other supervised methods. In\naddition, we show that the model can meet the real-time requirement by\nanalyzing the model complexity in terms of the number of trainable parameters\nand inference time. This study successfully reduced the number of model\nparameters by five times and the inference time by eight times, compared to a\nstate-of-the-art model.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers antenna impedance estimation based on training sequences\nat MIMO receivers. The goal is to firstly leverage extensive resources\navailable in most wireless systems for channel estimation to estimate antenna\nimpedance in real-time. We assume the receiver switches its impedance in a\npredetermined fashion during each training sequence. Based on voltage\nobservation across the load, a classical estimation framework is developed\nincorporating the Rayleigh fading assumption. We then derive in closed-form a\nmaximum-likelihood (ML) estimator under i.i.d. fading and show this same ML\nestimator is a method of moments (MM) estimator in correlated channels.\nNumerical results suggest a fast algorithm, i.e., MLE in i.i.d. fading and the\nMM estimator in correlated fading, that estimates the unknown antenna impedance\nin real-time for all Rayleigh fading channels.",

For the task of zero-shot learning, visual attributes\nhave been shown to play an important role, while in the few-shot regime, the\neffect of attributes is under-explored. To better transfer attribute-based\nknowledge from seen to unseen classes, we argue that an image representation\nwith integrated attribute localization ability would be beneficial for\nany-shot, i.e. zero-shot and few-shot, image classification tasks. To this end,\nwe propose a novel representation learning framework that jointly learns\ndiscriminative global and local features using only class-level attributes.\nWhile a visual-semantic embedding layer learns global features, local features\nare learned through an attribute prototype network that simultaneously\nregresses and decorrelates attributes from intermediate features. Furthermore,\nwe introduce a zoom-in module that localizes and crops the informative regions\nto encourage the network to learn informative features explicitly. We show that\nour locality augmented image representations achieve a new state-of-the-art on\nchallenging benchmarks, i.e. CUB, AWA2, and SUN.

For both UDA and UDE, a model tailored to\na given domain, let it be the source or the target domain, is assumed to well\nhandle samples from the given domain.

Although\nthe selection of {\\Delta} greatly affects the training results, previous works\nestimate {\\Delta} via an approximation or treat it as a hyper-parameter, which\nis suboptimal.

Although\nthere has been some effort to understand the properties of single-modality\nembedding spaces, particularly that of text, their cross-modal counterparts are\nless understood. In this work, we study a joint speech-text embedding space\ntrained for semantic matching by minimizing the distance between paired\nutterance and transcription inputs. This was done through dual encoders in a\nteacher-student model setup, with a pretrained language model acting as the\nteacher and a transformer-based speech encoder as the student. We extend our\nmethod to incorporate automatic speech recognition through both pretraining and\nmultitask scenarios and found that both approaches improve semantic matching.\nMultiple techniques were utilized to analyze and evaluate cross-modal semantic\nalignment of the embeddings: a quantitative retrieval accuracy metric,\nzero-shot classification to investigate generalizability, and probing of the\nencoders to observe the extent of knowledge transfer from one modality to\nanother.",

    "title": "Dynamic Focus-aware Positional Queries for Semantic Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Most of the latest top semantic segmentation approaches are based on vision\nTransformers, particularly DETR-like frameworks, which employ a set of queries\nin the Transformer decoder. Each query is composed of a content query that\npreserves semantic information and a positional query that provides positional\nguidance for aggregating the query-specific context. However, the positional\nqueries in the Transformer decoder layers are typically represented as fixed\nlearnable weights, which often encode dataset statistics for segments and can\nbe inaccurate for individual samples. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to\ngenerate positional queries dynamically conditioned on the cross-attention\nscores and the localization information of the preceding layer. By doing so,\neach query is aware of its previous focus, thus providing more accurate\npositional guidance and encouraging the cross-attention consistency across the\ndecoder layers. In addition, we also propose an efficient way to deal with\nhigh-resolution cross-attention by dynamically determining the contextual\ntokens based on the low-resolution cross-attention maps to perform local\nrelation aggregation. Our overall framework termed FASeg (Focus-Aware semantic\nSegmentation) provides a simple yet effective solution for semantic\nsegmentation. Extensive experiments on ADE20K and Cityscapes show that our\nFASeg achieves state-of-the-art performance, e.g., obtaining 48.3% and 49.6%\nmIoU respectively for single-scale inference on ADE20K validation set with\nResNet-50 and Swin-T backbones, and barely increases the computation\nconsumption from Mask2former.

Recently, a new\nTransformer module, applying on batch dimension rather than spatial/channel\ndimension, i.e., BatchFormer [18], has been introduced to explore sample\nrelationships for overcoming data scarcity challenges. However, it only works\nwith image-level representations for classification. In this paper, we devise a\nmore general batch Transformer module, BatchFormerV2, which further enables\nexploring sample relationships for dense representation learning. Specifically,\nwhen applying the proposed module, it employs a two-stream pipeline during\ntraining, i.e., either with or without a BatchFormerV2 module, where the\nbatchformer stream can be removed for testing. Therefore, the proposed method\nis a plug-and-play module and can be easily integrated into different vision\nTransformers without any extra inference cost. Without bells and whistles, we\nshow the effectiveness of the proposed method for a variety of popular visual\nrecognition tasks, including image classification and two important dense\nprediction tasks: object detection and panoptic segmentation.

In this method, each operation is replicated in time and the\nderived final results are voted to generate the final output. To consider the\neffect of permanent faults, replicating identical operations in time is not\nsufficient, and diversifying the operands is required. To this aim in FT-EALU,\nwe consider three distinct versions of input data and apply the target\noperation to them serially in time. To avoid high time overhead, we employ\nsimple operators such as shift and swap to make an appropriate diversion in\ninput data. Our proposed fault tolerance approach passes the replicated and\ndiverse results to a novel weighted voter that is designed based on the\nreward/punishment strategy. For each version of execution, based on the\nproposed weighting approach a corresponding weight according to its correction\ncapability confronting several faulty scenarios is defined. This weight defines\nthe reliability of the result of each version of execution and determines its\neffect on the final result. The final result is generated bit by bit based on\nthe weight of each execution and its computed result. These weights are\ndetermined statically through a design-time learning scheme according to\napplying several types of faults on various data bits. Based on the capability\nof execution versions on mitigating the permanent faults, positive or negative\nscores are assigned to them. These scores are integrated for several cases and\nnormalized to derive the appropriate weight of each execution at bit level.\nSeveral experiments are performed to show the efficiency of our proposed\napproach and based on them, FT-EALU is capable of correcting about 84.93% and\n69.71% of permanent injected faults on single and double bits of input data.",

Prior dense pose estimation methods are all based on Mask\nR-CNN framework and operate in a top-down manner of first attempting to\nidentify a bounding box for each person and matching dense correspondences in\neach bounding box. Consequently, these methods lack robustness due to their\ncritical dependence on the Mask R-CNN detection, and the runtime increases\ndrastically as the number of persons in the image increases. We therefore\npropose a novel alternative method for solving the dense pose estimation\nproblem, called Direct Dense Pose (DDP). DDP first predicts the instance mask\nand global IUV representation separately and then combines them together. We\nalso propose a simple yet effective 2D temporal-smoothing scheme to alleviate\nthe temporal jitters when dealing with video data. Experiments demonstrate that\nDDP overcomes the limitations of previous top-down baseline methods and\nachieves competitive accuracy.

    "abstract": "While personalization increases the utility of recommender systems, it also\nbrings the issue of filter bubbles. E.g., if the system keeps exposing and\nrecommending the items that the user is interested in, it may also make the\nuser feel bored and less satisfied. Existing work studies filter bubbles in\nstatic recommendation, where the effect of overexposure is hard to capture. In\ncontrast, we believe it is more meaningful to study the issue in interactive\nrecommendation and optimize long-term user satisfaction. Nevertheless, it is\nunrealistic to train the model online due to the high cost. As such, we have to\nleverage offline training data and disentangle the causal effect on user\nsatisfaction.\nTo achieve this goal, we propose a counterfactual interactive recommender\nsystem (CIRS) that augments offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) with\ncausal inference. The basic idea is to first learn a causal user model on\nhistorical data to capture the overexposure effect of items on user\nsatisfaction. It then uses the learned causal user model to help the planning\nof the RL policy. To conduct evaluation offline, we innovatively create an\nauthentic RL environment (KuaiEnv) based on a real-world fully observed user\nrating dataset.

Except for synthetic\nsource environments, acquiring such rich supervision for each real target\ndomain at deployment is highly inconvenient. However, we realize that standard\nforeground silhouette estimation techniques (on static camera feeds) remain\nunaffected by domain-shifts. Motivated by this, we propose a novel target\nadaptation framework that relies only on silhouette supervision to adapt a\nsource-trained model-based regressor. However, in the absence of any auxiliary\ncue (multi-view, depth, or 2D pose), an isolated silhouette loss fails to\nprovide a reliable pose-specific gradient and requires to be employed in tandem\nwith a topology-centric loss. To this end, we develop a series of\nconvolution-friendly spatial transformations in order to disentangle a\ntopological-skeleton representation from the raw silhouette. Such a design\npaves the way to devise a Chamfer-inspired spatial topological-alignment loss\nvia distance field computation, while effectively avoiding any gradient\nhindering spatial-to-pointset mapping.

    "abstract": "Recent advancement in the field of pervasive healthcare monitoring systems\ncauses the generation of a huge amount of lifelog data in real-time. Chronic\ndiseases are one of the most serious health challenges in developing and\ndeveloped countries. According to WHO, this accounts for 73% of all deaths and\n60% of the global burden of diseases. Chronic disease classification models are\nnow harnessing the potential of lifelog data to explore better healthcare\npractices. This paper is to construct an optimal feature selection-based\nunsupervised logistic regression model (OFS-ULR) to classify chronic diseases.\nSince lifelog data analysis is crucial due to its sensitive nature; thus the\nconventional classification models show limited performance. Therefore,\ndesigning new classifiers for the classification of chronic diseases using\nlifelog data is the need of the age. The vital part of building a good model\ndepends on pre-processing of the dataset, identifying important features, and\nthen training a learning algorithm with suitable hyper parameters for better\nperformance. The proposed approach improves the performance of existing methods\nusing a series of steps such as (i) removing redundant or invalid instances,\n(ii) making the data labelled using clustering and partitioning the data into\nclasses, (iii) identifying the suitable subset of features by applying either\nsome domain knowledge or selection algorithm, (iv) hyper parameter tuning for\nmodels to get best results, and (v) performance evaluation using Spark\nstreaming environment. For this purpose, two-time series datasets are used in\nthe experiment to compute the accuracy, recall, precision, and f1-score. The\nexperimental analysis proves the suitability of the proposed approach as\ncompared to the conventional classifiers and our newly constructed model\nachieved highest accuracy and reduced training complexity among all among all.",

CHO has turned out\nto be a successful feature and attracted several other areas of mobile\nnetworks, where increased reliability is also desirable (e.g. Non-Terrestrial\nNetworks or Integrated Access Backhaul). This paper explains the principles of\nCHO, describes its future use in vertical areas and provides performance\nresults showing the gains CHO may offer to 5G systems at higher frequency\nbands. Our simulative analysis was focused on the handover in Frequency Range 2\n(FR2) and CHO recovery procedure. Results have shown that also at higher\nfrequencies CHO can substantially reduce the mobility failures compared to\nbaseline handover of Release 15. Moreover, it has been verified that CHO\nrecovery can be a useful means to allow faster reconnection to the network\nafter a failure. In certain scenarios CHO Recovery usage ratio was found to\nexceed 80%. The paper also outlines the future research and standardization\ndirections in the area of CHO which appears to be a solid candidate for further\ndevelopment in 3GPP Release 18 and beyond.",

    "abstract": "GNNs encounter significant performance degradation when the amount of\nsupervision signals, i.e., number of labeled nodes, is limited, which is\nexpected as GNNs are trained solely based on the supervision obtained from the\nlabeled nodes. On the other hand,recent self-supervised learning paradigm aims\nto train GNNs by solving pretext tasks that do not require any labeled nodes,\nand it has shown to even outperform GNNs trained with few labeled nodes.\nHowever, a major drawback of self-supervised methods is that they fall short of\nlearning class discriminative node representations since no labeled information\nis utilized during training. To this end, we propose a novel semi-supervised\nmethod for graphs, GraFN, that leverages few labeled nodes to ensure nodes that\nbelong to the same class to be grouped together, thereby achieving the best of\nboth worlds of semi-supervised and self-supervised methods. Specifically, GraFN\nrandomly samples support nodes from labeled nodes and anchor nodes from the\nentire graph.

However, this\npublically shared data may hold personally identifiable information (PII) that\ncan be collected to re-identify a person. Therefore, an effective anonymization\nmechanism is required to anonymize such data before it is released publically.\nMicroaggregation is one of the Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) methods\nthat are widely used by many researchers. This method adapts the k-anonymity\nprinciple to generate k-indistinguishable records in the same clusters to\npreserve the privacy of the individuals. However, in these methods, the size of\nthe clusters is fixed (i.e., k records), and the clusters generated through\nthese methods may hold non-homogeneous records. By considering these issues, we\npropose an adaptive size clustering technique that aggregates homogeneous\nrecords in similar clusters, and the size of the clusters is determined after\nthe semantic analysis of the records. To achieve this, we extend the MDAV\nmicroaggregation algorithm to semantically analyze the unstructured records by\nrelying on the taxonomic databases (i.e., WordNet), and then aggregating them\nin homogeneous clusters. Furthermore, we propose a distance measure that\ndetermines the extent to which the records differ from each other, and based on\nthis, homogeneous adaptive clusters are constructed.

We focus on the decision-based\nblack-box attack setting, where the attackers have no access to the model\nparameters and gradients, but can only acquire the rank positions of the\npartial retrieved list by querying the target model.

Second, we introduce and\nemploy the well-known Otsu's method (from image processing) to conduct\nthresholding on the residual errors so as to obtain the best separation\n(grouping) statistically which maximizes the between-class variance. Third, to\nenhance robustness, we design a multi-layered Otsu's thresholding approach in\ncombination with our framework to sift out the true inliers from outliers that\nmight even occupy the majority of measurements. We test our robust estimator\nIMOT on 5 different spatial perception problems including: rotation averaging,\nrotation search, point cloud registration, category-level registration, and\nSLAM. Experiments show that IMOT is robust against 70%--90% of outliers and can\ntypically converge in only 3--10 iterations, being 3--125 times faster than\nexisting robust estimators: GNC and ADAPT. Moreover, IMOT is able to return\nrobust results even without noise bound information.",

    "abstract": "In using the Bayesian network (BN) to construct the complex multistate\nsystem's reliability model as described in Part I, the memory storage\nrequirements of the node probability table (NPT) will exceed the random access\nmemory (RAM) of the computer. However, the proposed inference algorithm of Part\nI is not suitable for the dependent system. This Part II proposes a novel\nmethod for BN reliability modeling and analysis to apply the compression idea\nto the complex multistate dependent system. In this Part II, the dependent\nnodes and their parent nodes are equivalent to a block, based on which the\nmultistate joint probability inference algorithm is proposed to calculate the\njoint probability distribution of a block's all nodes. Then, based on the\nproposed multistate compression algorithm of Part I, the dependent multistate\ninference algorithm is proposed for the complex multistate dependent system.\nThe use and accuracy of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated in case 1.\nFinally, the proposed algorithms are applied to the reliability modeling and\nanalysis of the satellite attitude control system. The results show that both\nPart I and Part II's proposed algorithms make the reliability modeling and\nanalysis of the complex multistate system feasible.",

Different from the previous urban distribution mode that\ndepends on trucks, this paper proposes a novel package pick-up and delivery\nmode and system in which multiple drones collaborate with automatic devices.\nThe proposed mode uses free areas on the top of residential buildings to set\nautomatic devices as delivery and pick-up points of packages, and employs\ndrones to transport packages between buildings and depots.

We propose a simulated-annealing-based\ntwo-phase optimization approach (SATO) to solve this problem. In the first\nphase, tasks are allocated to depots for serving, such that the initial problem\nis decomposed into multiple single depot scheduling problems with m-drone. In\nthe second phase, considering the drone capability constraints and task demand\nconstraints, we generate the route planning scheme for drones in each depot.\nConcurrently, an improved variable neighborhood descent algorithm (IVND) is\ndesigned in the first phase to reallocate tasks, and a local search algorithm\n(LS) are proposed to search the high-quality solution in the second phase.\nFinally, extensive experiments and comparative studies are conducted to test\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Results show that the 72 studies were\ndone in only 23 countries across the globe, with the majority of studies being\nreported for developed countries such as USA (20.64%) and Germany (11.11%).\nThus this could rapidly aid intervention of mental health disorder with XR.\nMeanwhile, none of the studies observed was from an African country.

Many methods that perform well on automatic\nfacial action unit (AU) detection primarily focus on modeling various types of\nAU relations between corresponding local muscle areas, or simply mining global\nattention-aware facial features, however, neglect the dynamic interactions\namong local-global features. We argue that encoding AU features just from one\nperspective may not capture the rich contextual information between regional\nand global face features, as well as the detailed variability across AUs,\nbecause of the diversity in expression and individual characteristics. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Multi-level Graph Relational Reasoning Network\n(termed MGRR-Net) for facial AU detection. Each layer of MGRR-Net performs a\nmulti-level (i.e., region-level, pixel-wise and channel-wise level) feature\nlearning. While the region-level feature learning from local face patches\nfeatures via graph neural network can encode the correlation across different\nAUs, the pixel-wise and channel-wise feature learning via graph attention\nnetwork can enhance the discrimination ability of AU features from global face\nfeatures. The fused features from the three levels lead to improved AU\ndiscriminative ability.

In this paper we propose a novel strategy to\nautomatically learn the optimal metric for PR.

    "title": "Synthetic Graph Generation to Benchmark Graph Learning",
    "abstract": "Graph learning algorithms have attained state-of-the-art performance on many\ngraph analysis tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and\nclustering. It has, however, become hard to track the field's burgeoning\nprogress. One reason is due to the very small number of datasets used in\npractice to benchmark the performance of graph learning algorithms. This\nshockingly small sample size (~10) allows for only limited scientific insight\ninto the problem.\nIn this work, we aim to address this deficiency. We propose to generate\nsynthetic graphs, and study the behaviour of graph learning algorithms in a\ncontrolled scenario. We develop a fully-featured synthetic graph generator that\nallows deep inspection of different models. We argue that synthetic graph\ngenerations allows for thorough investigation of algorithms and provides more\ninsights than overfitting on three citation datasets. In the case study, we\nshow how our framework provides insight into unsupervised and supervised graph\nneural network models.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, with the rising number of sensors in sectors such as healthcare and\nindustry, the problem of multivariate time series classification (MTSC) is\ngetting increasingly relevant and is a prime target for machine and deep\nlearning approaches. Their expanding adoption in real-world environments is\ncausing a shift in focus from the pursuit of ever higher prediction accuracy\nwith complex models towards practical, deployable solutions that balance\naccuracy and parameters such as prediction speed. An MTSC model that has\nattracted attention recently is ROCKET, based on random convolutional kernels,\nboth because of its very fast training process and its state-of-the-art\naccuracy. However, the large number of features it utilizes may be detrimental\nto inference time. Examining its theoretical background and limitations enables\nus to address potential drawbacks and present LightWaveS: a framework for\naccurate MTSC, which is fast both during training and inference. Specifically,\nutilizing wavelet scattering transformation and distributed feature selection,\nwe manage to create a solution which employs just 2.5% of the ROCKET features,\nwhile achieving accuracy comparable to recent deep learning models. LightWaveS\nalso scales well across multiple compute nodes and with the number of input\nchannels during training. In addition, it can significantly reduce the input\nsize and provide insight to an MTSC problem by keeping only the most useful\nchannels. We present three versions of our algorithm and their results on\ndistributed training time and scalability, accuracy and inference speedup. We\nshow that we achieve speedup ranging from 9x to 65x compared to ROCKET during\ninference on an edge device, on datasets with comparable accuracy.",

This pruning setup is\nparticularly important for cross-lingual models that implicitly learn alignment\nbetween language representations during pretraining, which if distorted via\npruning, not only leads to poorer performance on language data used for\nretraining but also on zero-shot languages that are evaluated.\nIn this work, we show that there is a clear performance discrepancy in\nmagnitude-based pruning when comparing standard supervised learning to the\nzero-shot setting. From this finding, we propose two weight regularizers that\naim to maximize the alignment between units of pruned and unpruned networks to\nmitigate alignment distortion in pruned cross-lingual models and perform well\nfor both non zero-shot and zero-shot settings.\nWe provide experimental results on cross-lingual tasks for the zero-shot\nsetting using XLM-RoBERTa$_{\\mathrm{Base}}$, where we also find that pruning\nhas varying degrees of representational degradation depending on the language\ncorresponding to the zero-shot test set.

Most rasterization-based approaches are built on\ngeneral-purpose automatic differentiation (AD) libraries and DR-specific\nmodules handcrafted using CUDA. Such a system design mixes DR algorithm\nimplementation and algorithm building blocks, resulting in hardware dependency\nand limited performance. In this paper, we present a practical\nhardware-agnostic differentiable renderer called Dressi, which is based on a\nnew full AD design. The DR algorithms of Dressi are fully written in our\nVulkan-based AD for DR, Dressi-AD, which supports all primitive operations for\nDR. Dressi-AD and our inverse UV technique inside it bring hardware\nindependence and acceleration by graphics hardware. Stage packing, our runtime\noptimization technique, can adapt hardware constraints and efficiently execute\ncomplex computational graphs of DR with reactive cache considering the render\npass hierarchy of Vulkan. HardSoftRas, our novel rendering process, is designed\nfor inverse rendering with a graphics pipeline. Under the limited\nfunctionalities of the graphics pipeline, HardSoftRas can propagate the\ngradients of pixels from the screen space to far-range triangle attributes.

These models are pre-trained\non unlabeled audio data and then used in speech processing downstream tasks\nsuch as automatic speech recognition (ASR) or speech translation (ST). Since\nthese models are now used in research and industrial systems alike, it becomes\nnecessary to understand the impact caused by some features such as gender\ndistribution within pre-training data. Using French as our investigation\nlanguage, we train and compare gender-specific wav2vec 2.0 models against\nmodels containing different degrees of gender balance in their pre-training\ndata. The comparison is performed by applying these models to two\nspeech-to-text downstream tasks: ASR and ST. Our results show that the type of\ndownstream integration matters. We observe lower overall performance using\ngender-specific pre-training before fine-tuning an end-to-end ASR system.\nHowever, when self-supervised models are used as feature extractors, the\noverall ASR and ST results follow more complex patterns, in which the balanced\npre-trained model is not necessarily the best option. Lastly, our crude\n'fairness' metric, the relative performance difference measured between female\nand male test sets, does not display a strong variation from balanced to\ngender-specific pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 models.",

The natural approach to these tasks is to use\nordinal online algorithms that at each step only consider relative ranking\namong the arrived elements, without looking at the numerical values of the\ninput. We formally study the question of how cardinal algorithms (that can use\nnumerical values of the input) can improve upon ordinal algorithms.\nWe give a universal construction of the input distribution for any ordinal\nonline problem, such that the advantage of the cardinal algorithms over the\nordinal algorithms is at most $1+\\varepsilon$ for arbitrary small $\\varepsilon>\n0$. However, the value range of the input elements in this construction is\nhuge: $O\\left(\\frac{n^3\\cdot n!}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\uparrow\\uparrow (n-1)$ for\nan input sequence of length $n$.

To\novercome this challenge, we propose to impose the consistency between two views\nin a feature space instead of the image space, named feature-metric\nconsistency. Interestingly, we find that, although a stereo matching network\ntrained with the photometric loss is not optimal, its feature extractor can\nproduce degradation-agnostic and matching-specific features. These features can\nthen be utilized to formulate a feature-metric loss to avoid the photometric\ninconsistency. Moreover, we introduce a self-boosting strategy to optimize the\nfeature extractor progressively, which further strengthens the feature-metric\nconsistency.

The analogy in linear circuit theory is a chain of series/parallel\none-ports: the port behavior is a continued fraction containing the port\nbehaviors of its elements. Truncating a continued fraction is a classical\nmethod of approximation, which corresponds to deleting the circuit elements\nfurthest from the port. We apply this idea to chains of series/parallel\none-ports composed of arbitrary nonlinear relations. This gives a model\nreduction method which automatically preserves properties such as incremental\npositivity. The Scaled Relative Graph (SRG) gives a graphical representation of\nthe original and truncated port behaviors. The difference of these SRGs gives a\nbound on the approximation error, which is shown to be competitive with\nexisting methods.",

Since real world networks are too large and complex to be\nmonitored by a human, algorithmic monitoring systems have been developed. A\npopular type of such systems are residual based anomaly detection systems that\ncan detect events such as leakages and sensor faults.

    "abstract": "The ability to acquire abstract knowledge is a hallmark of human intelligence\nand is believed by many to be one of the core differences between humans and\nneural network models. Agents can be endowed with an inductive bias towards\nabstraction through meta-learning, where they are trained on a distribution of\ntasks that share some abstract structure that can be learned and applied.\nHowever, because neural networks are hard to interpret, it can be difficult to\ntell whether agents have learned the underlying abstraction, or alternatively\nstatistical patterns that are characteristic of that abstraction. In this work,\nwe compare the performance of humans and agents in a meta-reinforcement\nlearning paradigm in which tasks are generated from abstract rules. We define a\nnovel methodology for building \"task metamers\" that closely match the\nstatistics of the abstract tasks but use a different underlying generative\nprocess, and evaluate performance on both abstract and metamer tasks. In our\nfirst set of experiments, we found that humans perform better at abstract tasks\nthan metamer tasks whereas a widely-used meta-reinforcement learning agent\nperforms worse on the abstract tasks than the matched metamers. In a second set\nof experiments, we base the tasks on abstractions derived directly from\nempirically identified human priors. We utilize the same procedure to generate\ncorresponding metamer tasks, and see the same double dissociation between\nhumans and agents. This work provides a foundation for characterizing\ndifferences between humans and machine learning that can be used in future work\ntowards developing machines with human-like behavior.",

    "abstract": "We present a new domain generalized semantic segmentation network named\nWildNet, which learns domain-generalized features by leveraging a variety of\ncontents and styles from the wild. In domain generalization, the low\ngeneralization ability for unseen target domains is clearly due to overfitting\nto the source domain. To address this problem, previous works have focused on\ngeneralizing the domain by removing or diversifying the styles of the source\ndomain. These alleviated overfitting to the source-style but overlooked\noverfitting to the source-content. In this paper, we propose to diversify both\nthe content and style of the source domain with the help of the wild. Our main\nidea is for networks to naturally learn domain-generalized semantic information\nfrom the wild. To this end, we diversify styles by augmenting source features\nto resemble wild styles and enable networks to adapt to a variety of styles.\nFurthermore, we encourage networks to learn class-discriminant features by\nproviding semantic variations borrowed from the wild to source contents in the\nfeature space. Finally, we regularize networks to capture consistent semantic\ninformation even when both the content and style of the source domain are\nextended to the wild. Extensive experiments on five different datasets validate\nthe effectiveness of our WildNet, and we significantly outperform\nstate-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we deal with the fast video temporal\ngrounding (FVTG) task, aiming at localizing the target segment with high speed\nand favorable accuracy. Most existing approaches adopt elaborately designed\ncross-modal interaction modules to improve the grounding performance, which\nsuffer from the test-time bottleneck. Although several common space-based\nmethods enjoy the high-speed merit during inference, they can hardly capture\nthe comprehensive and explicit relations between visual and textual modalities.\nIn this paper, to tackle the dilemma of speed-accuracy tradeoff, we propose a\ncommonsense-aware cross-modal alignment (CCA) framework, which incorporates\ncommonsense-guided visual and text representations into a complementary common\nspace for fast video temporal grounding. Specifically, the commonsense concepts\nare explored and exploited by extracting the structural semantic information\nfrom a language corpus. Then, a commonsense-aware interaction module is\ndesigned to obtain bridged visual and text features by utilizing the learned\ncommonsense concepts. Finally, to maintain the original semantic information of\ntextual queries, a cross-modal complementary common space is optimized to\nobtain matching scores for performing FVTG.

The model in MBRL is often solely fitted to reconstruct\ndynamics, state observations in particular, while the impact of model error on\nthe policy is not captured by the training objective. This leads to a mismatch\nbetween the intended goal of MBRL, enabling good policy and value learning, and\nthe target of the loss function employed in practice, future state prediction.\nNaive intuition would suggest that value-aware model learning would fix this\nproblem and, indeed, several solutions to this objective mismatch problem have\nbeen proposed based on theoretical analysis. However, they tend to be inferior\nin practice to commonly used maximum likelihood (MLE) based approaches. In this\npaper we propose the Value-gradient weighted Model Learning (VaGraM), a novel\nmethod for value-aware model learning which improves the performance of MBRL in\nchallenging settings, such as small model capacity and the presence of\ndistracting state dimensions. We analyze both MLE and value-aware approaches\nand demonstrate how they fail to account for exploration and the behavior of\nfunction approximation when learning value-aware models and highlight the\nadditional goals that must be met to stabilize optimization in the deep\nlearning setting.

    "abstract": "Shannon entropy is often a quantity of interest to linguists studying the\ncommunicative capacity of human language. However, entropy must typically be\nestimated from observed data because researchers do not have access to the\nunderlying probability distribution that gives rise to these data. While\nentropy estimation is a well-studied problem in other fields, there is not yet\na comprehensive exploration of the efficacy of entropy estimators for use with\nlinguistic data. In this work, we fill this void, studying the empirical\neffectiveness of different entropy estimators for linguistic distributions. In\na replication of two recent information-theoretic linguistic studies, we find\nevidence that the reported effect size is over-estimated due to over-reliance\non poor entropy estimators. Finally, we end our paper with concrete\nrecommendations for entropy estimation depending on distribution type and data\navailability.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised learning has been popular in various computer vision tasks,\nincluding visual object tracking. However, prior unsupervised tracking\napproaches rely heavily on spatial supervision from template-search pairs and\nare still unable to track objects with strong variation over a long time span.\nAs unlimited self-supervision signals can be obtained by tracking a video along\na cycle in time, we investigate evolving a Siamese tracker by tracking videos\nforward-backward. We present a novel unsupervised tracking framework, in which\nwe can learn temporal correspondence both on the classification branch and\nregression branch. Specifically, to propagate reliable template feature in the\nforward propagation process so that the tracker can be trained in the cycle, we\nfirst propose a consistency propagation transformation. We then identify an\nill-posed penalty problem in conventional cycle training in backward\npropagation process. Thus, a differentiable region mask is proposed to select\nfeatures as well as to implicitly penalize tracking errors on intermediate\nframes. Moreover, since noisy labels may degrade training, we propose a\nmask-guided loss reweighting strategy to assign dynamic weights based on the\nquality of pseudo labels. In extensive experiments, our tracker outperforms\npreceding unsupervised methods by a substantial margin, performing on par with\nsupervised methods on large-scale datasets such as TrackingNet and LaSOT.

    "abstract": "Federated Recommendation (FR) has received considerable popularity and\nattention in the past few years. In FR, for each user, its feature vector and\ninteraction data are kept locally on its own client thus are private to others.\nWithout the access to above information, most existing poisoning attacks\nagainst recommender systems or federated learning lose validity. Benifiting\nfrom this characteristic, FR is commonly considered fairly secured. However, we\nargue that there is still possible and necessary security improvement could be\nmade in FR. To prove our opinion, in this paper we present FedRecAttack, a\nmodel poisoning attack to FR aiming to raise the exposure ratio of target\nitems. In most recommendation scenarios, apart from private user-item\ninteractions (e.g., clicks, watches and purchases), some interactions are\npublic (e.g., likes, follows and comments). Motivated by this point, in\nFedRecAttack we make use of the public interactions to approximate users'\nfeature vectors, thereby attacker can generate poisoned gradients accordingly\nand control malicious users to upload the poisoned gradients in a well-designed\nway. To evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of FedRecAttack, we conduct\nextensive experiments on three real-world datasets of different sizes from two\ncompletely different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed FedRecAttack achieves the state-of-the-art effectiveness while its\nside effects are negligible. Moreover, even with small proportion (3%) of\nmalicious users and small proportion (1%) of public interactions, FedRecAttack\nremains highly effective, which reveals that FR is more vulnerable to attack\nthan people commonly considered.",

The diversity of reflections and scenes further makes it a\nmission impossible to learn a single model being effective to all testing sets\nand real-world reflections. In this paper, we tackle these issues by learning\nSIRR models from a domain generalization perspective. Particularly, for each\nsource set, a specific SIRR model is trained to serve as a domain expert of\nrelevant reflection types. For a given reflection-contaminated image, we\npresent a reflection type-aware weighting (RTAW) module to predict expert-wise\nweights. RTAW can then be incorporated with adaptive network combination\n(AdaNEC) for handling different reflection types and scenes, i.e., generalizing\nto unknown domains. Two representative AdaNEC methods, i.e., output fusion (OF)\nand network interpolation (NI), are provided by considering both adaptation\nlevels and efficiency. For images from one source set, we train RTAW to only\npredict expert-wise weights of other domain experts for improving\ngeneralization ability, while the weights of all experts are predicted and\nemployed during testing. An in-domain expert (IDE) loss is presented for\ntraining RTAW. Extensive experiments show the appealing performance gain of our\nAdaNEC on different state-of-the-art SIRR networks.

    "abstract": "Deep metric learning has yielded impressive results in tasks such as\nclustering and image retrieval by leveraging neural networks to obtain highly\ndiscriminative feature embeddings, which can be used to group samples into\ndifferent classes. Much research has been devoted to the design of smart loss\nfunctions or data mining strategies for training such networks. Most methods\nconsider only pairs or triplets of samples within a mini-batch to compute the\nloss function, which is commonly based on the distance between embeddings. We\npropose Group Loss, a loss function based on a differentiable label-propagation\nmethod that enforces embedding similarity across all samples of a group while\npromoting, at the same time, low-density regions amongst data points belonging\nto different groups. Guided by the smoothness assumption that \"similar objects\nshould belong to the same group\", the proposed loss trains the neural network\nfor a classification task, enforcing a consistent labelling amongst samples\nwithin a class. We design a set of inference strategies tailored towards our\nalgorithm, named Group Loss++ that further improve the results of our model. We\nshow state-of-the-art results on clustering and image retrieval on four\nretrieval datasets, and present competitive results on two person\nre-identification datasets, providing a unified framework for retrieval and\nre-identification.",

    "abstract": "Visual object tracking acts as a pivotal component in various emerging video\napplications. Despite the numerous developments in visual tracking, existing\ndeep trackers are still likely to fail when tracking against objects with\ndramatic variation. These deep trackers usually do not perform online update or\nupdate single sub-branch of the tracking model, for which they cannot adapt to\nthe appearance variation of objects. Efficient updating methods are therefore\ncrucial for tracking while previous meta-updater optimizes trackers directly\nover parameter space, which is prone to over-fit even collapse on longer\nsequences. To address these issues, we propose a context-aware tracking model\nto optimize the tracker over the representation space, which jointly\nmeta-update both branches by exploiting information along the whole sequence,\nsuch that it can avoid the over-fitting problem. First, we note that the\nembedded features of the localization branch and the box-estimation branch,\nfocusing on the local and global information of the target, are effective\ncomplements to each other. Based on this insight, we devise a\ncontext-aggregation module to fuse information in historical frames, followed\nby a context-aware module to learn affinity vectors for both branches of the\ntracker. Besides, we develop a dedicated meta-learning scheme, on account of\nfast and stable updating with limited training samples. The proposed tracking\nmethod achieves an EAO score of 0.514 on VOT2018 with the speed of 40FPS,\ndemonstrating its capability of improving the accuracy and robustness of the\nunderlying tracker with little speed drop.",

While Android-specific IPC mechanisms have been\nstudied extensively, Unix domain sockets have not been examined\ncomprehensively, despite playing a crucial role in the IPC of highly privileged\nsystem daemons. In this paper, we propose SAUSAGE, an efficient novel static\nanalysis framework to study the security properties of these sockets.

It is a fully\nstatic analysis framework, specifically designed to analyze Unix domain socket\nusage in Android system daemons, at scale. We use this framework to analyze 200\nAndroid images across eight popular smartphone vendors spanning Android\nversions 7-9. As a result, we uncover multiple access control misconfigurations\nand insecure authentication checks. Our notable findings include a permission\nbypass in highly privileged Qualcomm system daemons and an unprotected socket\nthat allows an untrusted app to set the scheduling priority of other processes\nrunning on the system, despite the implementation of mandatory SELinux\npolicies.

It is a challenging issue due to the consequences of non-i.i.d.\nproperties of client's data, often referred to as statistical heterogeneity and\nsmall local data samples from the various data distributions. Therefore, to\ndevelop robust generalized global and personalized models, conventional FL\nmethods need redesigning the knowledge aggregation from biased local models\nwhile considering huge divergence of learning parameters due to skewed client\ndata. In this work, we demonstrate that the knowledge transfer mechanism is a\nde facto technique to achieve these objectives and develop a novel knowledge\ndistillation-based approach to study the extent of knowledge transfer between\nthe global model and local models. Henceforth, our method considers the\nsuitability of transferring the outcome distribution and (or) the embedding\nvector of representation from trained models during cross-device knowledge\ntransfer using a small proxy dataset in heterogeneous FL. In doing so, we\nalternatively perform cross-device knowledge transfer following general\nformulations as 1) global knowledge transfer and 2) on-device knowledge\ntransfer.

In the\nstateful case, the detector keeps track of the sensor residuals (i.e., the\ndifference of estimated and true outputs) and reports an alarm if certain\nstatistics of the recorded residuals deviate over a predefined threshold, e.g.,\n\\chi^2 (Chi-square) detector. Instead, only instantaneous deviation of the\nresiduals raises the alarm in the stateless case without considering the\nhistory of the sensor outputs and estimation data. Given (approximate)\nfalse-alarm rate for both cases, we propose a probabilistic threshold design\nbased on the noise statistics. We show by simulation that increasing the window\nlength in the stateful case may not necessarily reduce the false-alarm rate. On\nthe other hand, it adds unwanted delay to raise the alarm. The distributed\naspect of the proposed detection algorithm enables local isolation of the\nfaulty sensors with possible recovery solutions by adding redundant\nobservationally-equivalent sensors. We, then, offer a mechanism to design\nQ-redundant distributed observers, robust to failure (or removal) of up to Q\nsensors over the network.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have empowered accurate device-free human activity\nrecognition, which has wide applications. Deep models can extract robust\nfeatures from various sensors and generalize well even in challenging\nsituations such as data-insufficient cases. However, these systems could be\nvulnerable to input perturbations, i.e. adversarial attacks. We empirically\ndemonstrate that both black-box Gaussian attacks and modern adversarial\nwhite-box attacks can render their accuracies to plummet. In this paper, we\nfirstly point out that such phenomenon can bring severe safety hazards to\ndevice-free sensing systems, and then propose a novel learning framework,\nRobustSense, to defend common attacks. RobustSense aims to achieve consistent\npredictions regardless of whether there exists an attack on its input or not,\nalleviating the negative effect of distribution perturbation caused by\nadversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method\ncan significantly enhance the model robustness of existing deep models,\novercoming possible attacks.

    "abstract": "Studies on the automatic processing of 3D human pose data have flourished in\nthe recent past. In this paper, we are interested in the generation of\nplausible and diverse future human poses following an observed 3D pose\nsequence. Current methods address this problem by injecting random variables\nfrom a single latent space into a deterministic motion prediction framework,\nwhich precludes the inherent multi-modality in human motion generation. In\naddition, previous works rarely explore the use of attention to select which\nframes are to be used to inform the generation process up to our knowledge. To\novercome these limitations, we propose Hierarchical Transformer Dynamical\nVariational Autoencoder, HiT-DVAE, which implements auto-regressive generation\nwith transformer-like attention mechanisms. HiT-DVAE simultaneously learns the\nevolution of data and latent space distribution with time correlated\nprobabilistic dependencies, thus enabling the generative model to learn a more\ncomplex and time-varying latent space as well as diverse and realistic human\nmotions. Furthermore, the auto-regressive generation brings more flexibility on\nobservation and prediction, i.e. one can have any length of observation and\npredict arbitrary large sequences of poses with a single pre-trained model. We\nevaluate the proposed method on HumanEva-I and Human3.6M with various\nevaluation methods, and outperform the state-of-the-art methods on most of the\nmetrics.",

Such attacks are\ncarefully crafted imperceptible noises that can fool the network and can cause\nsevere consequences when deployed. To encounter them, the model requires\ntraining data for adversarial training or explicit regularization-based\ntechniques. However, privacy has become an important concern, restricting\naccess to only trained models but not the training data (e.g. biometric data).\nAlso, data curation is expensive and companies may have proprietary rights over\nit. To handle such situations, we propose a completely novel problem of\n'test-time adversarial defense in absence of training data and even their\nstatistics'. We solve it in two stages: a) detection and b) correction of\nadversarial samples. Our adversarial sample detection framework is initially\ntrained on arbitrary data and is subsequently adapted to the unlabelled test\ndata through unsupervised domain adaptation. We further correct the predictions\non detected adversarial samples by transforming them in Fourier domain and\nobtaining their low frequency component at our proposed suitable radius for\nmodel prediction. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed technique via\nextensive experiments against several adversarial attacks and for different\nmodel architectures and datasets. For a non-robust Resnet-18 model pre-trained\non CIFAR-10, our detection method correctly identifies 91.42% adversaries.\nAlso, we significantly improve the adversarial accuracy from 0% to 37.37% with\na minimal drop of 0.02% in clean accuracy on state-of-the-art 'Auto Attack'\nwithout having to retrain the model.",

The goal is expressed\nthrough an LTL-X formula, and represents a behaviour of the system that the\nuser needs to guarantee. The user can try to reach his goal by controlling a\nsubset of transitions, and by observing a subset of local states. Although we\ndo not put any requirement on the local states observable by the user, we\nassume that he cannot be sure to observe them in the exact moment in which they\nbecome marked. For this reason, we define a notion of stability of the\nobservation. We propose a method to determine whether the user has a winning\nstrategy, i.e. if he can win every play by taking some decisions based on the\ninformation available for him.",

Additionally, we review the role of ML in\nmolecular phenotyping and cross-species biomarker identification in precision\npsychiatry. We further discuss explainable AI (XAI) and causality testing in a\nclosed-human-in-the-loop manner, and highlight the ML potential in multimedia\ninformation extraction and multimodal data fusion.

For tracing the root\ncauses of poor damping and tuning modes of the system, the sensitivity of the\nmodes to components and parameters are needed. The so-called critical\nadmittance-eigenvalue sensitivity based on nodal admittance model has provided\na partial solution but omits meaningful directional information.

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in designing lossy data compression schemes is how\nwell one can do in comparison with the rate-distortion function, which\ndescribes the known theoretical limits of lossy compression. Motivated by the\nempirical success of deep neural network (DNN) compressors on large, real-world\ndata, we investigate methods to estimate the rate-distortion function on such\ndata, which would allow comparison of DNN compressors with optimality. While\none could use the empirical distribution of the data and apply the\nBlahut-Arimoto algorithm, this approach presents several computational\nchallenges and inaccuracies when the datasets are large and high-dimensional,\nsuch as the case of modern image datasets. Instead, we re-formulate the\nrate-distortion objective, and solve the resulting functional optimization\nproblem using neural networks. We apply the resulting rate-distortion\nestimator, called NERD, on popular image datasets, and provide evidence that\nNERD can accurately estimate the rate-distortion function. Using our estimate,\nwe show that the rate-distortion achievable by DNN compressors are within\nseveral bits of the rate-distortion function for real-world datasets.\nAdditionally, NERD provides access to the rate-distortion achieving channel, as\nwell as samples from its output marginal. Therefore, using recent results in\nreverse channel coding, we describe how NERD can be used to construct an\noperational one-shot lossy compression scheme with guarantees on the achievable\nrate and distortion.

The first challenge is that metaverse application development\ninevitably requires the support of various artificial intelligence (AI)\ntechnologies such as natural language processing (NLP), knowledge graph (KG),\ncomputer vision (CV), and machine learning (ML), etc. However, existing\nmetaverse application development lacks a lightweight AI technology framework.\nThis paper proposes a flexible metaverse AI technology framework metaAID that\naims to support language and semantic technologies in the development of\ndigital twins and virtual humans. The second challenge is that the development\nprocess of metaverse applications involves both technical development tasks and\nmanual editing work, and often becomes a heavyweight multi-team collaboration\nproject, not to mention the development of metaverse applications in multiple\nindustries. Our framework summarizes common AI technologies and application\ndevelopment templates with common functional modules and interfaces.

    "abstract": "Real-life industrial use cases for machine learning oftentimes involve\nheterogeneous and dynamic assets, processes and data, resulting in a need to\ncontinuously adapt the learning algorithm accordingly. Industrial transfer\nlearning offers to lower the effort of such adaptation by allowing the\nutilization of previously acquired knowledge in solving new (variants of)\ntasks. Being data-driven methods, the development of industrial transfer\nlearning algorithms naturally requires appropriate datasets for training.\nHowever, open-source datasets suitable for transfer learning training, i.e.\nspanning different assets, processes and data (variants), are rare. With the\nStuttgart Open Relay Degradation Dataset (SOReDD) we want to offer such a\ndataset. It provides data on the degradation of different electromechanical\nrelays under different operating conditions, allowing for a large number of\ndifferent transfer scenarios. Although such relays themselves are usually\ninexpensive standard components, their failure often leads to the failure of a\nmachine as a whole due to their role as the central power switching element of\na machine. The main cost factor in the event of a relay defect is therefore not\nthe relay itself, but the reduced machine availability. It is therefore\ndesirable to predict relay degradation as accurately as possible for specific\napplications in order to be able to replace relays in good time and avoid\nunplanned machine downtimes. Nevertheless, data-driven failure prediction for\nelectromechanical relays faces the challenge that relay degradation behavior is\nhighly dependent on the operating conditions, high-resolution measurement data\non relay degradation behavior is only collected in rare cases, and such data\ncan then only cover a fraction of the possible operating environments.

The regularity of the solution to the equivalent random\nequation is obtained, in one dimension, with the aid of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg\ninequality and done in two and three dimensions, by the energy argument.\nFurther, the approximate solution is shown to be strongly convergent to the\nunique mild solution of the original CHC equation, whose spatio-temporal\nregularity can be attained by similar arguments.

Automatic code summarization is a prized target\nof software engineering research, due to the high value summaries have to\nprogrammers and the simultaneously high cost of writing and maintaining\ndocumentation by hand. Current work is almost all based on machine models\ntrained via big data input. Large datasets of examples of code and summaries of\nthat code are used to train an e.g. encoder-decoder neural model. Then the\noutput predictions of the model are evaluated against a set of reference\nsummaries. The input is code not seen by the model, and the prediction is\ncompared to a reference. The means by which a prediction is compared to a\nreference is essentially word overlap, calculated via a metric such as BLEU or\nROUGE. The problem with using word overlap is that not all words in a sentence\nhave the same importance, and many words have synonyms. The result is that\ncalculated similarity may not match the perceived similarity by human readers.\nIn this paper, we conduct an experiment to measure the degree to which various\nword overlap metrics correlate to human-rated similarity of predicted and\nreference summaries.

The key challenge\nis that shared behavior between friends could be equally explained by influence\nor by two other confounding factors: 1) latent traits that caused people to\nboth become friends and engage in the behavior, and 2) latent preferences for\nthe behavior. This paper addresses the challenges of estimating social\ninfluence with three contributions. First, we formalize social influence as a\ncausal effect, one which requires inferences about hypothetical interventions.\nSecond, we develop Poisson Influence Factorization (PIF), a method for\nestimating social influence from observational data. PIF fits probabilistic\nfactor models to networks and behavior data to infer variables that serve as\nsubstitutes for the confounding latent traits. Third, we develop assumptions\nunder which PIF recovers estimates of social influence. We empirically study\nPIF with semi-synthetic and real data from Last.fm, and conduct a sensitivity\nanalysis. We find that PIF estimates social influence most accurately compared\nto related methods and remains robust under some violations of its assumptions.",

We\npropose a novel way of progressive pruning, referred to as \\textit{Anytime\nProgressive Pruning} (APP); the proposed approach significantly outperforms the\nbaseline dense and Anytime OSP models across multiple architectures and\ndatasets under short, moderate, and long-sequence training. Our method, for\nexample, shows an improvement in accuracy of $\\approx 7\\%$ and a reduction in\nthe generalization gap by $\\approx 22\\%$, while being $\\approx 1/3$ rd the size\nof the dense baseline model in few-shot restricted imagenet training. We\nfurther observe interesting nonmonotonic transitions in the generalization gap\nin the high number of megabatches-based ALMA.

    "title": "Characterizing Parametric and Convergence Stability in Nonconvex and  Nonsmooth Optimizations: A Geometric Approach",
    "abstract": "We consider stability issues in minimizing a continuous (probably\nparameterized, nonconvex and nonsmooth) real-valued function $f$. We call a\npoint stationary if all its possible directional derivatives are nonnegative.\nIn this work, we focus on two notions of stability on stationary points of $f$:\nparametric stability and convergence stability. Parametric considerations are\nwidely studied in various fields, including smoothed analysis, numerical\nstability, condition numbers and sensitivity analysis for linear programming.\nParametric stability asks whether minor perturbations on parameters lead to\ndramatic changes in the position and $f$ value of a stationary point.\nMeanwhile, convergence stability indicates a non-escapable solution: Any point\nsequence iteratively produced by an optimization algorithm cannot escape from a\nneighborhood of a stationary point but gets close to it in the sense that such\nstationary points are stable to the precision parameter and algorithmic\nnumerical errors. It turns out that these notions have deep connections to\ngeometry theory. We show that parametric stability is linked to deformations of\ngraphs of functions. On the other hand, convergence stability is concerned with\narea partitioning of the function domain. Utilizing these connections, we prove\nquite tight conditions of these two stability notions for a wide range of\nfunctions and optimization algorithms with small enough step sizes and\nprecision parameters. These conditions are subtle in the sense that a slightly\nweaker function requirement goes to the opposite of primitive intuitions and\nleads to wrong conclusions. We present three applications of this theory. These\napplications reveal some understanding on Nash equilibrium computation,\nnonconvex and nonsmooth optimization, as well as the new optimization\nmethodology of deep neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Randomized linear solvers leverage randomization to structure-blindly\ncompress and solve a linear system to produce an inexpensive solution. While\nsuch a property is highly desirable, randomized linear solvers often suffer\nwhen it comes to performance as either (1) problem structure is not being\nexploited, and (2) hardware is inefficiently used. Thus, randomized adaptive\nsolvers are starting to appear that use the benefits of randomness while\nattempting to still exploit problem structure and reduce hardware\ninefficiencies. Unfortunately, such randomized adaptive solvers are likely to\nbe without a theoretical foundation to show that they will work (i.e., find a\nsolution). Accordingly, here, we distill three general criteria for randomized\nblock adaptive solvers, which, as we show, will guarantee convergence of the\nrandomized adaptive solver and supply a worst-case rate of convergence.

    "abstract": "Over-parameterization is one of the inherent characteristics of modern deep\nneural networks, which can often be overcome by leveraging regularization\nmethods, such as Dropout.

    "abstract": "The early detection of drowsiness has become vital to ensure the correct and\nsafe development of several industries' tasks. Due to the transient mental\nstate of a human subject between alertness and drowsiness, automated drowsiness\ndetection is a complex problem to tackle. The electroencephalography signals\nallow us to record variations in an individual's brain's electrical potential,\nwhere each of them gives specific information about a subject's mental state.\nHowever, due to this type of signal's nature, its acquisition, in general, is\ncomplex, so it is hard to have a large volume of data to apply techniques of\nDeep Learning for processing and classification optimally. Nevertheless,\nCapsule Neural Networks are a brand-new Deep Learning algorithm proposed for\nwork with reduced amounts of data. It is a robust algorithm to handle the\ndata's hierarchical relationships, which is an essential characteristic for\nwork with biomedical signals. Therefore, this paper presents a Deep\nLearning-based method for drowsiness detection with CapsNet by using a\nconcatenation of spectrogram images of the electroencephalography signals\nchannels. The proposed CapsNet model is compared with a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork, which is outperformed by the proposed model, which obtains an average\naccuracy of 86,44% and 87,57% of sensitivity against an average accuracy of\n75,86% and 79,47% sensitivity for the CNN, showing that CapsNet is more\nsuitable for this kind of datasets and tasks.",

    "abstract": "Indexing is a well-known database technique used to facilitate data access\nand speed up query processing. Nevertheless, the construction and modification\nof indexes are very expensive. In traditional approaches, all records in the\ndatabase table are equally covered by the index. It is not effective, since\nsome records may be queried very often and some never. To avoid this problem,\nadaptive merging has been introduced. The key idea is to create index\nadaptively and incrementally as a side-product of query processing. As a\nresult, the database table is indexed partially depending on the query\nworkload. This paper faces a problem of adaptive merging for phase change\nmemory (PCM). The most important features of this memory type are: limited\nwrite endurance and high write latency. As a consequence, adaptive merging\nshould be investigated from the scratch. We solve this problem in two steps.\nFirst, we apply several PCM optimization techniques to the traditional adaptive\nmerging approach. We prove that the proposed method (eAM) outperforms a\ntraditional approach by 60%. After that, we invent the framework for adaptive\nmerging (PAM) and a new PCM-optimized index. It further improves the system\nperformance by 20% for databases where search queries interleave with data\nmodifications.",

The current study explores the usefulness of using Wav2Vec\nself-supervised speech representations as features for training an ASR system\nfor dysarthric speech. Dysarthric speech recognition is particularly difficult\nas several aspects of speech such as articulation, prosody and phonation can be\nimpaired.

    "abstract": "Synthesis of ergodic, stationary visual patterns is widely applicable in\ntexturing, shape modeling, and digital content creation. The wide applicability\nof this technique thus requires the pattern synthesis approaches to be\nscalable, diverse, and authentic. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based\nvisual pattern synthesis framework that aims to model the inner statistics of\nvisual patterns and generate new, versatile patterns that meet the\naforementioned requirements. To this end, we propose an implicit network based\non generative adversarial network (GAN) and periodic encoding, thus calling our\nnetwork the Implicit Periodic Field Network (IPFN). The design of IPFN ensures\nscalability: the implicit formulation directly maps the input coordinates to\nfeatures, which enables synthesis of arbitrary size and is computationally\nefficient for 3D shape synthesis. Learning with a periodic encoding scheme\nencourages diversity: the network is constrained to model the inner statistics\nof the exemplar based on spatial latent codes in a periodic field. Coupled with\ncontinuously designed GAN training procedures, IPFN is shown to synthesize\ntileable patterns with smooth transitions and local variations. Last but not\nleast, thanks to both the adversarial training technique and the encoded\nFourier features, IPFN learns high-frequency functions that produce authentic,\nhigh-quality results. To validate our approach, we present novel experimental\nresults on various applications in 2D texture synthesis and 3D shape synthesis.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of finding collision-free paths for\ncurvature-constrained systems in the presence of obstacles while minimizing\nexecution time. Specifically, we focus on the setting where a planar system can\ntravel at some range of speeds with unbounded acceleration. This setting can\nmodel many systems, such as fixed-wing drones. Unfortunately, planning for such\nsystems might require evaluating many (local) time-optimal transitions\nconnecting two close-by configurations, which is computationally expensive.\nExisting methods either pre-compute all such transitions in a preprocessing\nstage or use heuristics to speed up the search, thus foregoing any guarantees\non solution quality. Our key insight is that computing all the time-optimal\ntransitions is both~(i)~computationally expensive and~(ii)~unnecessary for many\nproblem instances. We show that by finding bounded-suboptimal solutions\n(solutions whose cost is bounded by $1+\\varepsilon$ times the cost of the\noptimal solution for any user-provided $\\varepsilon$) and not time-optimal\nsolutions, one can dramatically reduce the number of time-optimal transitions\nused.

Such knowledge could be extremely useful to robots aiming to act upon\nhigh-level, temporally extended instructions expressed in natural language.\nHowever, a significant weakness of language models is that they lack real-world\nexperience, which makes it difficult to leverage them for decision making\nwithin a given embodiment. For example, asking a language model to describe how\nto clean a spill might result in a reasonable narrative, but it may not be\napplicable to a particular agent, such as a robot, that needs to perform this\ntask in a particular environment. We propose to provide real-world grounding by\nmeans of pretrained skills, which are used to constrain the model to propose\nnatural language actions that are both feasible and contextually appropriate.\nThe robot can act as the language model's \"hands and eyes,\" while the language\nmodel supplies high-level semantic knowledge about the task. We show how\nlow-level skills can be combined with large language models so that the\nlanguage model provides high-level knowledge about the procedures for\nperforming complex and temporally-extended instructions, while value functions\nassociated with these skills provide the grounding necessary to connect this\nknowledge to a particular physical environment. We evaluate our method on a\nnumber of real-world robotic tasks, where we show the need for real-world\ngrounding and that this approach is capable of completing long-horizon,\nabstract, natural language instructions on a mobile manipulator.

    "title": "Long Movie Clip Classification with State-Space Video Models",
    "abstract": "Most modern video recognition models are designed to operate on short video\nclips (e.g., 5-10s in length). Because of this, it is challenging to apply such\nmodels to long movie understanding tasks, which typically require sophisticated\nlong-range temporal reasoning capabilities. The recently introduced video\ntransformers partially address this issue by using long-range temporal\nself-attention. However, due to the quadratic cost of self-attention, such\nmodels are often costly and impractical to use. Instead, we propose ViS4mer, an\nefficient long-range video model that combines the strengths of self-attention\nand the recently introduced structured state-space sequence (S4) layer. Our\nmodel uses a standard Transformer encoder for short-range spatiotemporal\nfeature extraction, and a multi-scale temporal S4 decoder for subsequent\nlong-range temporal reasoning. By progressively reducing the spatiotemporal\nfeature resolution and channel dimension at each decoder layer, ViS4mer learns\ncomplex long-range spatiotemporal dependencies in a video. Furthermore, ViS4mer\nis $2.63\\times$ faster and requires $8\\times$ less GPU memory than the\ncorresponding pure self-attention-based model. Additionally, ViS4mer achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in $7$ out of $9$ long-form movie video classification\ntasks on the LVU benchmark. Furthermore, we also show that our approach\nsuccessfully generalizes to other domains, achieving competitive results on the\nBreakfast and the COIN procedural activity datasets. The code will be made\npublicly available.",

    "title": "Monitoring social distancing with single image depth estimation",
    "abstract": "The recent pandemic emergency raised many challenges regarding the\ncountermeasures aimed at containing the virus spread, and constraining the\nminimum distance between people resulted in one of the most effective\nstrategies. Thus, the implementation of autonomous systems capable of\nmonitoring the so-called social distance gained much interest. In this paper,\nwe aim to address this task leveraging a single RGB frame without additional\ndepth sensors. In contrast to existing single-image alternatives failing when\nground localization is not available, we rely on single image depth estimation\nto perceive the 3D structure of the observed scene and estimate the distance\nbetween people. During the setup phase, a straightforward calibration\nprocedure, leveraging a scale-aware SLAM algorithm available even on consumer\nsmartphones, allows us to address the scale ambiguity affecting single image\ndepth estimation. We validate our approach through indoor and outdoor images\nemploying a calibrated LiDAR + RGB camera asset. Experimental results highlight\nthat our proposal enables sufficiently reliable estimation of the\ninter-personal distance to monitor social distancing effectively. This fact\nconfirms that despite its intrinsic ambiguity, if appropriately driven single\nimage depth estimation can be a viable alternative to other depth perception\ntechniques, more expensive and not always feasible in practical applications.\nOur evaluation also highlights that our framework can run reasonably fast and\ncomparably to competitors, even on pure CPU systems. Moreover, its practical\ndeployment on low-power systems is around the corner.",

The\nmodel can capture accurate hand shape and appearance, generalize to arbitrary\nhand subjects, provide dense surface correspondences, be reconstructed from\nimages in the wild and easily animated. We train LISA by minimizing the shape\nand appearance losses on a large set of multi-view RGB image sequences\nannotated with coarse 3D poses of the hand skeleton. For a 3D point in the hand\nlocal coordinate, our model predicts the color and the signed distance with\nrespect to each hand bone independently, and then combines the per-bone\npredictions using predicted skinning weights. The shape, color and pose\nrepresentations are disentangled by design, allowing to estimate or animate\nonly selected parameters.

    "abstract": "We propose to forecast future hand-object interactions given an egocentric\nvideo. Instead of predicting action labels or pixels, we directly predict the\nhand motion trajectory and the future contact points on the next active object\n(i.e., interaction hotspots). This relatively low-dimensional representation\nprovides a concrete description of future interactions. To tackle this task, we\nfirst provide an automatic way to collect trajectory and hotspots labels on\nlarge-scale data. We then use this data to train an Object-Centric Transformer\n(OCT) model for prediction. Our model performs hand and object interaction\nreasoning via the self-attention mechanism in Transformers. OCT also provides a\nprobabilistic framework to sample the future trajectory and hotspots to handle\nuncertainty in prediction. We perform experiments on the Epic-Kitchens-55,\nEpic-Kitchens-100, and EGTEA Gaze+ datasets, and show that OCT significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin.

    "abstract": "Transformers have recently gained significant attention in the computer\nvision community. However, the lack of scalability of self-attention mechanisms\nwith respect to image size has limited their wide adoption in state-of-the-art\nvision backbones. In this paper we introduce an efficient and scalable\nattention model we call multi-axis attention, which consists of two aspects:\nblocked local and dilated global attention. These design choices allow\nglobal-local spatial interactions on arbitrary input resolutions with only\nlinear complexity. We also present a new architectural element by effectively\nblending our proposed attention model with convolutions, and accordingly\npropose a simple hierarchical vision backbone, dubbed MaxViT, by simply\nrepeating the basic building block over multiple stages. Notably, MaxViT is\nable to \"see\" globally throughout the entire network, even in earlier,\nhigh-resolution stages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a\nbroad spectrum of vision tasks. On image classification, MaxViT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance under various settings: without extra data, MaxViT\nattains 86.5\\% ImageNet-1K top-1 accuracy; with ImageNet-21K pre-training, our\nmodel achieves 88.7\\% top-1 accuracy. For downstream tasks, MaxViT as a\nbackbone delivers favorable performance on object detection as well as visual\naesthetic assessment. We also show that our proposed model expresses strong\ngenerative modeling capability on ImageNet, demonstrating the superior\npotential of MaxViT blocks as a universal vision module.

Prior work on LN detection has been limited to\nspecific anatomical regions of the body (pelvis, rectum) in single MR slices.\nTherefore, the development of a universal approach to detect LN in full T2 MRI\nvolumes is highly desirable.\nMethods: In this study, a Computer Aided Detection (CAD) pipeline to\nuniversally identify abdominal LN in volumetric T2 MRI using neural networks is\nproposed. First, we trained various neural network models for detecting LN:\nFaster RCNN with and without Hard Negative Example Mining (HNEM), FCOS,\nFoveaBox, VFNet, and Detection Transformer (DETR). Next, we show that the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) VFNet model with Adaptive Training Sample Selection\n(ATSS) outperforms Faster RCNN with HNEM. Finally, we ensembled models that\nsurpassed a 45% mAP threshold. We found that the VFNet model and one-stage\nmodel ensemble can be interchangeably used in the CAD pipeline.\nResults: Experiments on 122 test T2 MRI volumes revealed that VFNet achieved\na 51.1% mAP and 78.7% recall at 4 false positives (FP) per volume, while the\none-stage model ensemble achieved a mAP of 52.3% and sensitivity of 78.7% at\n4FP.\nConclusion: Our contribution is a CAD pipeline that detects LN in T2 MRI\nvolumes, resulting in a sensitivity improvement of $\\sim$14 points over the\ncurrent SOTA method for LN detection (sensitivity of 78.7% at 4 FP vs. 64.6% at\n5 FP per volume).",

The experiments\non three image restoration tasks, \\textit{i.e.,} ideal SISR, realistic SISR,\nand real-world SISR, demonstrate that our method has superior model\ngeneralizability against varying noise levels and degradation kernels and is\neffective in unsupervised SISR.

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based methods have made impressive progress in enhancing\nextremely low-light images - the image quality of the reconstructed images has\ngenerally improved. However, we found out that most of these methods could not\nsufficiently recover the image details, for instance, the texts in the scene.\nIn this paper, a novel image enhancement framework is proposed to precisely\nrestore the scene texts, as well as the overall quality of the image\nsimultaneously under extremely low-light images conditions. Mainly, we employed\na self-regularised attention map, an edge map, and a novel text detection loss.\nIn addition, leveraging synthetic low-light images is beneficial for image\nenhancement on the genuine ones in terms of text detection. The quantitative\nand qualitative experimental results have shown that the proposed model\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in image restoration, text detection, and\ntext spotting on See In the Dark and ICDAR15 datasets.",

    "title": "UNetFormer: A Unified Vision Transformer Model and Pre-Training  Framework for 3D Medical Image Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViT)s have recently become popular due to their\noutstanding modeling capabilities, in particular for capturing long-range\ninformation, and scalability to dataset and model sizes which has led to\nstate-of-the-art performance in various computer vision and medical image\nanalysis tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework consisting of\ntwo architectures, dubbed UNetFormer, with a 3D Swin Transformer-based encoder\nand Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transformer-based decoders. In the\nproposed model, the encoder is linked to the decoder via skip connections at\nfive different resolutions with deep supervision. The design of proposed\narchitecture allows for meeting a wide range of trade-off requirements between\naccuracy and computational cost. In addition, we present a methodology for\nself-supervised pre-training of the encoder backbone via learning to predict\nrandomly masked volumetric tokens using contextual information of visible\ntokens. We pre-train our framework on a cohort of $5050$ CT images, gathered\nfrom publicly available CT datasets, and present a systematic investigation of\nvarious components such as masking ratio and patch size that affect the\nrepresentation learning capability and performance of downstream tasks. We\nvalidate the effectiveness of our pre-training approach by fine-tuning and\ntesting our model on liver and liver tumor segmentation task using the Medical\nSegmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset and achieve state-of-the-art performance\nin terms of various segmentation metrics. To demonstrate its generalizability,\nwe train and test the model on BraTS 21 dataset for brain tumor segmentation\nusing MRI images and outperform other methods in terms of Dice score.

    "abstract": "The mainstream neural text-to-speech(TTS) pipeline is a cascade system,\nincluding an acoustic model(AM) that predicts acoustic feature from the input\ntranscript and a vocoder that generates waveform according to the given\nacoustic feature. However, the acoustic feature in current TTS systems is\ntypically mel-spectrogram, which is highly correlated along both time and\nfrequency axes in a complicated way, leading to a great difficulty for the AM\nto predict. Although high-fidelity audio can be generated by recent neural\nvocoders from ground-truth(GT) mel-spectrogram, the gap between the GT and the\npredicted mel-spectrogram from AM degrades the performance of the entire TTS\nsystem. In this work, we propose VQTTS, consisting of an AM txt2vec and a\nvocoder vec2wav, which uses self-supervised vector-quantized(VQ) acoustic\nfeature rather than mel-spectrogram. We redesign both the AM and the vocoder\naccordingly. In particular, txt2vec basically becomes a classification model\ninstead of a traditional regression model while vec2wav uses an additional\nfeature encoder before HifiGAN generator for smoothing the discontinuous\nquantized feature. Our experiments show that vec2wav achieves better\nreconstruction performance than HifiGAN when using self-supervised VQ acoustic\nfeature.

As Markov\nchains are stochastic processes, it is natural to use probability based\narguments for proofs. At the same time, the dynamics of a Markov chain is\ncompletely captured by its initial distribution, which is a vector, and its\ntransition probability matrix. Therefore, arguments based on matrix analysis\nand linear algebra can also be used. The proofs discussed below use one or the\nother of these two types of arguments, except in one case where the argument is\ngraph theoretic. Appropriate credits to the various proofs are given in the\nmain text.\nOur first proof is entirely elementary, and yet the proof is also quite\nsimple. The proof also suggests a mixing time bound, which we prove, but this\nbound in many cases will not be the best bound. One approach in proving the\nfundamental theorem breaks the proof in two parts: (i) show the existence of a\nunique positive stationary distribution for irreducible Markov chains, and (ii)\nassuming that an ergodic chain does have a stationary distribution, show that\nthe chain will converge in the limit to that distribution irrespective of the\ninitial distribution. For (i), we survey two proofs, one uses probability\narguments, and the other uses graph theoretic arguments. For (ii), first we\ngive a coupling based proof (coupling is a probability based technique), the\nother uses matrix analysis.

In this paper,a robust feature point matching\nalgorithm called Recovery and Filtering Vertex Trichotomy Matching (RFVTM) is\nproposed to remove outliers and retain sufficient inliers for remote sensing\nimages. A novel affine invariant descriptor called vertex trichotomy descriptor\nis proposed on the basis of that geometrical relations between any of vertices\nand lines are preserved after affine transformations, which is constructed by\nmapping each vertex into trichotomy sets. The outlier removals in Vertex\nTrichotomy Matching (VTM) are implemented by iteratively comparing the\ndisparity of corresponding vertex trichotomy descriptors. Some inliers\nmistakenly validated by a large amount of outliers are removed in VTM\niterations, and several residual outliers close to correct locations cannot be\nexcluded with the same graph structures. Therefore, a recovery and filtering\nstrategy is designed to recover some inliers based on identical vertex\ntrichotomy descriptors and restricted transformation errors. Assisted with the\nadditional recovered inliers, residual outliers can also be filtered out during\nthe process of reaching identical graph for the expanded vertex sets.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superior performance on precision and\nstability of this algorithm under various conditions, such as remote sensing\nimages with large transformations, duplicated patterns, or inconsistent\nspectral content.",

In this paper, an automatic image registration approach\nthrough line-support region segmentation and geometrical outlier removal\n(ALRS-GOR) is proposed.

To\nbegin with, line-support regions, namely a straight region whose points share\nroughly the same image gradient angle, are extracted to address the issues of\ninconsistent content existing in images. To alleviate the incompleteness of\nline segments, an iterative strategy with multi-resolution is employed to\npreserve global structures that are masked at full resolution by image details\nor noise. Then, Geometrical Outlier Removal (GOR) is developed to provide\nreliable feature point matching, which is based on affineinvariant geometrical\nclassifications for corresponding matches initialized by SIFT. The candidate\noutliers are selected by comparing the disparity of accumulated classifications\namong all matches, instead of conventional methods which only rely on local\ngeometrical relations.

With the model, we simulated\nthe retinal point spread function (PSF) of a point rendered by an LF display at\nvarious depths to characterise the retinal image quality. Additionally,\naccommodation responses to rendered LF images were estimated by computing the\nvisual Strehl ratio based on the optical transfer function (VSOTF) from the\nPSFs. We assumed an ideal LF display that had an infinite spatial resolution\nand was free from optical aberrations in the simulation. We tested images\nrendered at 0--4 dioptres of depths having angular resolutions of up to 4x4\nviewpoints within a pupil. The simulation predicted small and constant\naccommodation errors, which contradict the findings of previous studies. An\nevaluation of the optical resolution of the rendered retinal image suggested a\ntrade-off between the maximum resolution achievable and the depth range of a\nrendered image where in-focus resolution is kept high. The proposed framework\ncan be used to evaluate the upper bound of the optical performance of an LF\ndisplay for realistically aberrated eyes, which may help to find an optimal\nspatio-angular resolution required to render a high quality 3D scene.",

    "abstract": "Units equivariance is the exact symmetry that follows from the requirement\nthat relationships among measured quantities of physics relevance must obey\nself-consistent dimensional scalings. Here, we employ dimensional analysis and\nideas from equivariant machine learning to provide a two stage learning\nprocedure for units-equivariant machine learning. For a given learning task, we\nfirst construct a dimensionless version of its inputs using classic results\nfrom dimensional analysis, and then perform inference in the dimensionless\nspace.

    "abstract": "End-to-end neural diarization (EEND) is nowadays one of the most prominent\nresearch topics in speaker diarization. EEND presents an attractive alternative\nto standard cascaded diarization systems since a single system is trained at\nonce to deal with the whole diarization problem. Several EEND variants and\napproaches are being proposed, however, all these models require large amounts\nof annotated data for training but available annotated data are scarce. Thus,\nEEND works have used mostly simulated mixtures for training. However, simulated\nmixtures do not resemble real conversations in many aspects. In this work we\npresent an alternative method for creating synthetic conversations that\nresemble real ones by using statistics about distributions of pauses and\noverlaps estimated on genuine conversations. Furthermore, we analyze the effect\nof the source of the statistics, different augmentations and amounts of data.\nWe demonstrate that our approach performs substantially better than the\noriginal one, while reducing the dependence on the fine-tuning stage.\nExperiments are carried out on 2-speaker telephone conversations of Callhome\nand DIHARD 3. Together with this publication, we release our implementations of\nEEND and the method for creating simulated conversations.",

    "abstract": "A recent article that combines normalized epidemic compartmental models and\npopulation games put forth a system theoretic approach to capture the coupling\nbetween a population's strategic behavior and the course of an epidemic. It\nintroduced a payoff mechanism that governs the population's strategic choices\nvia incentives, leading to the lowest endemic proportion of infectious\nindividuals subject to cost constraints. Under the assumption that the disease\ndeath rate is approximately zero, it uses a Lyapunov function to prove\nconvergence and formulate a quasi-convex program to compute an upper bound for\nthe peak size of the population's infectious fraction. In this article, we\ngeneralize these results to the case in which the disease death rate is\nnonnegligible. This generalization brings on additional coupling terms in the\nnormalized compartmental model, leading to a more intricate Lyapunov function\nand payoff mechanism. Moreover, the associated upper bound can no longer be\ndetermined exactly, but it can be computed with arbitrary accuracy by solving a\nset of convex programs.",

If the set is coarsely dense and generic, then the corresponding\ninfinite sequences of minimum and maximum angles are both monotonic in $k$.

For such a set, the\ndistribution of angles in the Voronoi tessellations, Delaunay mosaics, and\nBrillouin tessellations are independent of the order and can be derived from\nthe formula for angles in order-$1$ Delaunay mosaics given by Miles in 1970.",

To create a\nsecond segmentation, it would be beneficial to both radiologists and patients\nin being more confident in their conclusions.

    "abstract": "With the development of fast routing algorithms for public transit the\noptimization of criteria other than arrival time has moved into the spotlight.\nDue to the often intricate nature of fare regulations, the price of a journey,\nwhile certainly being one of the most interesting criteria, is seldom\nconsidered. In this work, we present a novel framework to mathematically\ndescribe the fare systems of local public transit companies. The model allows\nus to solve the price-sensitive earliest arrival problem (PSEAP) even if prices\ndepend on a number of parameters and non-linear conditions. We base our\napproach on conditional fare networks (CFN). A CFN consists of a ticket graph\nmodeling tickets and the relations between them and a ticket transition\nfunction defined over a partially ordered monoid and a set of fare events.\nTypically, shortest path algorithms rely on the subpath optimality property\nwhich is usually lost when dealing with intricate fare systems. We show how\nsubpath optimality can be restored by relaxing domination rules for tickets\ndepending on the structure of the ticket graph. An exemplary model for the fare\nsystem of Mitteldeutsche Verkehrsbetriebe (MDV) is provided. PSEAP is NP-hard,\neven when considering a single-criterion version that optimizes for price only.\nInstances on finite monoids are, however, polynomial time solvable when the\nmonoid is considered part of the encoding length. By integrating our framework\nin the multi-criteria RAPTOR algorithm, we provide an algorithm for PSEAP and\nassess its performance on data obtained from MDV.

However, its performance is often inferior to that\nof a blind source separation (BSS) counterpart with a similar network\narchitecture, due to the auxiliary speaker encoder may sometimes generate\nambiguous speaker embeddings. Such ambiguous guidance information may confuse\nthe separation network and hence lead to wrong extraction results, which\ndeteriorates the overall performance.

In the training phase, we propose to integrate metric learning\nmethods to improve the distinguishability of embeddings produced by the speaker\nencoder. While for inference, a novel post-filtering strategy is designed to\nrevise the wrong results. Specifically, we first identify these confusion\nsamples by measuring the similarities between output estimates and enrollment\nutterances, after which the true target sources are recovered by a subtraction\noperation. Experiments show that performance improvement of more than 1dB\nSI-SDRi can be brought, which validates the effectiveness of our methods and\nemphasizes the impact of the target confusion problem.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose Discretely Indexed flows (DIF) as a new tool for\nsolving variational estimation problems. Roughly speaking, DIF are built as an\nextension of Normalizing Flows (NF), in which the deterministic transport\nbecomes stochastic, and more precisely discretely indexed. Due to the discrete\nnature of the underlying additional latent variable, DIF inherit the good\ncomputational behavior of NF: they benefit from both a tractable density as\nwell as a straightforward sampling scheme, and can thus be used for the dual\nproblems of Variational Inference (VI) and of Variational density estimation\n(VDE). On the other hand, DIF can also be understood as an extension of mixture\ndensity models, in which the constant mixture weights are replaced by flexible\nfunctions. As a consequence, DIF are better suited for capturing distributions\nwith discontinuities, sharp edges and fine details, which is a main advantage\nof this construction.

    "abstract": "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is widely used in deep learning due to its\ncomputational efficiency but a complete understanding of why SGD performs so\nwell remains a major challenge. It has been observed empirically that most\neigenvalues of the Hessian of the loss functions on the loss landscape of\nover-parametrized deep networks are close to zero, while only a small number of\neigenvalues are large. Zero eigenvalues indicate zero diffusion along the\ncorresponding directions. This indicates that the process of minima selection\nmainly happens in the relatively low-dimensional subspace corresponding to top\neigenvalues of the Hessian. Although the parameter space is very\nhigh-dimensional, these findings seems to indicate that the SGD dynamics may\nmainly live on a low-dimensional manifold. In this paper we pursue a truly data\ndriven approach to the problem of getting a potentially deeper understanding of\nthe high-dimensional parameter surface, and in particular of the landscape\ntraced out by SGD, by analyzing the data generated through SGD, or any other\noptimizer for that matter, in order to possibly discovery (local)\nlow-dimensional representations of the optimization landscape.

Although the architecture of RNN possesses\ninductive biases toward information over time, it is still challenging to learn\nthe path-dependent material behavior as a function of the loading path\nconsidering the change from elastic to elastoplastic regimes. Our attempt is to\ndevelop a simple machine-learning-based model that can replicate elastoplastic\nbehaviors considering material heterogeneity and anisotropy.

This poses complex challenges in modern\ndigital communications, and calls for the development of technological\ninnovations that (i) optimize capacity (bitrate) in limited bandwidth\nenvironments, (ii) integrate cooperatively with already-deployed RF protocols,\nand (iii) are adaptive to the ever-changing demands in modern digital\ncommunications. In this paper we present methods for applying deep neural\nnetworks for spectral filling. Given an RF channel transmitting digital\nmessages with a pre-established modulation scheme, we automatically learn novel\nmodulation schemes for sending extra information, in the form of additional\nmessages, \"around\" the fixed-modulation signals (i.e., without interfering with\nthem). In so doing, we effectively increase channel capacity without increasing\nbandwidth. We further demonstrate the ability to generate signals that closely\nresemble the original modulations, such that the presence of extra messages is\nundetectable to third-party listeners. We present three computational\nexperiments demonstrating the efficacy of our methods, and conclude by\ndiscussing the implications of our results for modern RF applications.",

We claim that, despite\nthis disadvantage, FCIRK16 is more efficient than explicit symplectic\nintegrators for high precision simulations thanks to: (i) its high order of\nprecision, (ii) its easy parallelization, and (iii) its efficient\nmixed-precision implementation which reduces the effect of round-off errors. In\naddition, unlike typical explicit symplectic integrators for near Keplerian\nproblems, FCIRK16 is able to integrate problems with arbitrary perturbations\n(non necessarily split as a sum of integrable parts). We present a novel\nanalysis of the effect of close encounters in the leading term of the local\ndiscretization errors of our integrator. Based on that analysis, a mechanism to\ndetect and refine integration steps that involve close encounters is\nincorporated in our code. That mechanism allows FCIRK16 to accurately resolve\nclose encounters of arbitrary bodies. We illustrate our treatment of close\nencounters with the application of FCIRK16 to a point mass Newtonian 15-body\nmodel of the Solar System (with the Sun, the eight planets, Pluto, and five\nmain asteroids) and a 16-body model treating the Moon as a separate body.

In this paper, we\nproposed an unsupervised clustering-based multiple-instance learning, and apply\nour method to develop deep-learning models for prediction of gene mutations\nusing WSIs from three cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies\n(CRC, LUAD, and HNSCC). We showed that unsupervised clustering of image patches\ncould help identify predictive patches, exclude patches lack of predictive\ninformation, and therefore improve prediction on gene mutations in all three\ndifferent cancer types, compared with the WSI based method without selection of\nimage patches and models based on only tumor regions. Additionally, our\nproposed algorithm outperformed two recently published baseline algorithms\nleveraging unsupervised clustering to assist model prediction. The\nunsupervised-clustering-based approach for mutation prediction allows\nidentification of the spatial regions related to mutation of a specific gene\nvia the resolved probability scores, highlighting the heterogeneity of a\npredicted genotype in the tumor microenvironment.
