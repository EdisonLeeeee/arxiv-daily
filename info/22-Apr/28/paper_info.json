    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has recently made significant progress as a new\nmachine learning paradigm for privacy protection. Due to the high communication\ncost of traditional FL, one-shot federated learning is gaining popularity as a\nway to reduce communication cost between clients and the server. Most of the\nexisting one-shot FL methods are based on Knowledge Distillation; however,\ndistillation based approach requires an extra training phase and depends on\npublicly available data sets. In this work, we consider a novel and challenging\nsetting: performing a single round of parameter aggregation on the local models\nwithout server-side training on a public data set. In this new setting, we\npropose an effective algorithm for Model Aggregation via Exploring Common\nHarmonized Optima (MA-Echo), which iteratively updates the parameters of all\nlocal models to bring them close to a common low-loss area on the loss surface,\nwithout harming performance on their own data sets at the same time. Compared\nto the existing methods, MA-Echo can work well even in extremely non-identical\ndata distribution settings where the support categories of each local model\nhave no overlapped labels with those of the others. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on two popular image classification data sets to compare the\nproposed method with existing methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of\nMA-Echo, which clearly outperforms the state-of-the-arts.",

    "abstract": "Upcoming large satellite constellations and the advent of tighter steerable\nbeams will offer unprecedented flexibility. This new flexibility will require\nresource management strategies to be operated in high-dimensional and dynamic\nenvironments, as existing satellite operators are unaccustomed to operational\nflexibility and automation. Frequency assignment policies have the potential to\ndrive constellations' performance in this new context, and are no exception to\nreal-time and scalability requirements. The majority of frequency assignment\nmethods proposed in the literature fail to fulfill these two requirements, or\nare unable to meet them without falling short on bandwidth and/or power\nefficiency. In this paper we propose a new frequency assignment method designed\nto prioritize operational requirements. We present an algorithm based on\nInteger Linear Programming (ILP) that is able to fully define a frequency plan\nwhile respecting key system constraints such as handovers and interference. We\nare able to encode operators' goals such as bandwidth maximization or power\nreduction and produce optimal or quasi-optimal plans according to such\nobjectives. In our experiments, we find our method is able to allocate at least\n50% more bandwidth and reduce power consumption by 40% compared to previous\noperational benchmarks. The performance advantage of our method compared to\nprevious solutions increases with the dimensionality of the constellation; in\nan experiment with a 5,000-beam MEO constellation we find that we can allocate\nthree times more bandwidth.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning reduces the risk of information leakage, but remains\nvulnerable to attacks. We investigate how several neural network design\ndecisions can defend against gradients inversion attacks. We show that\noverlapping gradients provides numerical resistance to gradient inversion on\nthe highly vulnerable dense layer. Specifically, we propose to leverage\nbatching to maximise mixing of gradients by choosing an appropriate loss\nfunction and drawing identical labels. We show that otherwise it is possible to\ndirectly recover all vectors in a mini-batch without any numerical optimisation\ndue to the de-mixing nature of the cross entropy loss. To accurately assess\ndata recovery, we introduce an absolute variation distance (AVD) metric for\ninformation leakage in images, derived from total variation. In contrast to\nstandard metrics, e.g. Mean Squared Error or Structural Similarity Index, AVD\noffers a continuous metric for extracting information in noisy images. Finally,\nour empirical results on information recovery from various inversion attacks\nand training performance supports our defense strategies. These strategies are\nalso shown to be useful for deep convolutional neural networks such as LeNET\nfor image recognition.

We extend the\ntraditional information bottleneck principle to learn common information among\ndifferent views in a self-supervised manner, and accordingly establish a new\nframework called Self-supervised Information Bottleneck based Multi-view\nSubspace Clustering (SIB-MSC). Inheriting the advantages from information\nbottleneck, SIB-MSC can learn a latent space for each view to capture common\ninformation among the latent representations of different views by removing\nsuperfluous information from the view itself while retaining sufficient\ninformation for the latent representations of other views. Actually, the latent\nrepresentation of each view provides a kind of self-supervised signal for\ntraining the latent representations of other views. Moreover, SIB-MSC attempts\nto learn the other latent space for each view to capture the view-specific\ninformation by introducing mutual information based regularization terms, so as\nto further improve the performance of multi-view subspace clustering. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore information bottleneck\nfor multi-view subspace clustering.

Our PolyLoss allows the importance of different\npolynomial bases to be easily adjusted depending on the targeting tasks and\ndatasets, while naturally subsuming the aforementioned cross-entropy loss and\nfocal loss as special cases. Extensive experimental results show that the\noptimal choice within the PolyLoss is indeed dependent on the task and dataset.\nSimply by introducing one extra hyperparameter and adding one line of code, our\nPoly-1 formulation outperforms the cross-entropy loss and focal loss on 2D\nimage classification, instance segmentation, object detection, and 3D object\ndetection tasks, sometimes by a large margin.",

To answer the first\nquestion, we propose a recommender system based on WGAN-GP called CFWGAN-GP\nwhich is founded on a previous model (CFGAN).

However, such information is not\ntypically made available in competitive scenarios, we therefore propose to\nconstruct a prediction and uncertainty model given data of the TV from previous\nraces. In particular, a one-step Gaussian Process (GP) model is trained on\nclosed-loop interaction data to learn the behavior of a TV driven by an unknown\npolicy. Predictions of the nominal trajectory and associated uncertainty are\nrolled out via a sampling-based approach and are used in a model predictive\ncontrol (MPC) policy for the ego vehicle in order to intelligently trade-off\nbetween safety and performance when attempting overtaking maneuvers against a\nTV. We demonstrate the GP-based predictor in closed loop with the MPC policy in\nsimulation races and compare its performance against several predictors from\nliterature.

    "abstract": "With more videos being recorded by edge sensors (cameras) and analyzed by\ncomputer-vision deep neural nets (DNNs), a new breed of video streaming systems\nhas emerged, with the goal to compress and stream videos to remote servers in\nreal time while preserving enough information to allow highly accurate\ninference by the server-side DNNs. An ideal design of the video streaming\nsystem should simultaneously meet three key requirements: (1) low latency of\nencoding and streaming, (2) high accuracy of server-side DNNs, and (3) low\ncompute overheads on the camera. Unfortunately, despite many recent efforts,\nsuch video streaming system has hitherto been elusive, especially when serving\nadvanced vision tasks such as object detection or semantic segmentation. This\npaper presents AccMPEG, a new video encoding and streaming system that meets\nall the three requirements. The key is to learn how much the encoding quality\nat each (16x16) macroblock can influence the server-side DNN accuracy, which we\ncall accuracy gradient. Our insight is that these macroblock-level accuracy\ngradient can be inferred with sufficient precision by feeding the video frames\nthrough a cheap model. AccMPEG provides a suite of techniques that, given a new\nserver-side DNN, can quickly create a cheap model to infer the accuracy\ngradient on any new frame in near realtime. Our extensive evaluation of AccMPEG\non two types of edge devices (one Intel Xeon Silver 4100 CPU or NVIDIA Jetson\nNano) and three vision tasks (six recent pre-trained DNNs) shows that AccMPEG\n(with the same camera-side compute resources) can reduce the end-to-end\ninference delay by 10-43% without hurting accuracy compared to the\nstate-of-the-art baselines",

    "abstract": "Product badges are ubiquitous in e-commerce platforms, acting as effective\npsychological triggers to nudge customers to buy specific products, boosting\nrevenues. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no attempt to\nsystematically study these badges and their several idiosyncrasies - we intend\nto close this gap in our current work. Specifically, we try to answer questions\nsuch as: How long does a product retain a badge on a given platform? If a\nproduct is sold on different platforms, then does it receive similar badges?\nHow do the products that receive badges differ from those which do not, in\nterms of price, customer rating, etc. We collect longitudinal data from several\ne-commerce platforms over 45 days, and find that although most of the badges\nare short-lived, there are several permanent badge assignments and that too for\nbadges meant to denote urgency or scarcity. Furthermore, it is unclear how the\nbadge assignments are done, and we find evidence that highly-rated products are\nmissing out on badges compared to lower quality ones. Our work calls for\ngreater transparency in the badge assignment process to inform customers, as\nwell as to reduce dissatisfaction among the sellers dependent on the platforms\nfor their revenues.",

    "abstract": "In multiple academic disciplines, having a perceived gender of `woman' is\nassociated with a lower than expected rate of citations. In some fields, that\ndisparity is driven primarily by the citations of men and is increasing over\ntime despite increasing diversification of the profession. It is likely that\ncomplex social interactions and individual ideologies shape these disparities.\nComputational models of select factors that reproduce empirical observations\ncan help us understand some of the minimal driving forces behind these complex\nphenomena and therefore aid in their mitigation. Here, we present a simple\nagent-based model of citation practices within academia, in which academics\ngenerate citations based on three factors: their estimate of the collaborative\nnetwork of the field, how they sample that estimate, and how open they are to\nlearning about their field from other academics. We show that increasing\nhomophily -- or the tendency of people to interact with others more like\nthemselves -- in these three domains is sufficient to reproduce observed biases\nin citation practices. We find that homophily in sampling an estimate of the\nfield influences total citation rates, and openness to learning from new and\nunfamiliar authors influences the change in those citations over time. We next\nmodel a real-world intervention -- the citation diversity statement -- which\nhas the potential to influence both of these parameters. We determine a\nparameterization of our model that matches the citation practices of academics\nwho use the citation diversity statement. This parameterization paired with an\nopenness to learning from many new authors can result in citation practices\nthat are equitable and stable over time. Ultimately, our work underscores the\nimportance of homophily in shaping citation practices and provides evidence\nthat specific actions may mitigate biased citation practices in academia.",

Fully homomorphic\nencryption (FHE) elevates the bar of today's solutions by adding\nconfidentiality of data during processing. It allows computation on fully\nencrypted data without the need for decryption, thus fully preserving privacy.\nTo enable processing encrypted data at usable levels of classic security, e.g.,\n128-bit, the encryption procedure introduces noticeable data size expansion -\nthe ciphertext is much bigger than the native aggregate of native data types.\nIn this paper, we present MemFHE which is the first accelerator of both client\nand server for the latest Ring-GSW (Gentry, Sahai, and Waters) based\nhomomorphic encryption schemes using Processing In Memory (PIM). PIM alleviates\nthe data movement issues with large FHE encrypted data, while providing in-situ\nexecution and extensive parallelism needed for FHE's polynomial operations.\nWhile the client-PIM can homomorphically encrypt and decrypt data, the\nserver-PIM can process homomorphically encrypted data without decryption.\nMemFHE's server-PIM is pipelined and is designed to provide flexible\nbootstrapping, allowing two encryption techniques and various FHE\nsecurity-levels based on the application requirements.

However, given that WebAssembly binaries can\nbe compiled from unsafe languages like C/C++, classical code vulnerabilities\nsuch as buffer overflows or format strings can be transferred over from the\noriginal programs down to the cross-compiled binaries. As a result, this\npossibility of incorporating vulnerabilities in WebAssembly modules has widened\nthe attack surface of modern web applications. This paper presents Wasmati, a\nstatic analysis tool for finding security vulnerabilities in WebAssembly\nbinaries. It is based on the generation of a code property graph (CPG), a\nprogram representation previously adopted for detecting vulnerabilities in\nvarious languages but hitherto unapplied to WebAssembly. We formalize the\ndefinition of CPG for WebAssembly, introduce techniques to generate CPG for\ncomplex WebAssembly, and present four different query specification languages\nfor finding vulnerabilities by traversing a program's CPG. We implemented ten\nqueries capturing different vulnerability types and extensively tested Wasmati\non four heterogeneous datasets. We show that Wasmati can scale the generation\nof CPGs for large real-world applications and can efficiently find\nvulnerabilities for all our query types.

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find near-optimal policies from\nlogged data without further environment interaction. Model-based algorithms,\nwhich learn a model of the environment from the dataset and perform\nconservative policy optimisation within that model, have emerged as a promising\napproach to this problem. In this work, we present Robust Adversarial\nModel-Based Offline RL (RAMBO), a novel approach to model-based offline RL. To\nachieve conservatism, we formulate the problem as a two-player zero sum game\nagainst an adversarial environment model. The model is trained minimise the\nvalue function while still accurately predicting the transitions in the\ndataset, forcing the policy to act conservatively in areas not covered by the\ndataset. To approximately solve the two-player game, we alternate between\noptimising the policy and optimising the model adversarially. The problem\nformulation that we address is theoretically grounded, resulting in a PAC\nperformance guarantee and a pessimistic value function which lower bounds the\nvalue function in the true environment. We evaluate our approach on widely\nstudied offline RL benchmarks, and demonstrate that our approach achieves state\nof the art performance.",

    "abstract": "Aquatic locomotion is a classic fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem of\ninterest to biologists and engineers. Solving the fully coupled FSI equations\nfor incompressible Navier-Stokes and finite elasticity is computationally\nexpensive. Optimizing robotic swimmer design within such a system generally\ninvolves cumbersome, gradient-free procedures on top of the already costly\nsimulation. To address this challenge we present a novel, fully differentiable\nhybrid approach to FSI that combines a 2D direct numerical simulation for the\ndeformable solid structure of the swimmer and a physics-constrained neural\nnetwork surrogate to capture hydrodynamic effects of the fluid. For the\ndeformable simulation of the swimmer's body, we use state-of-the-art techniques\nfrom the field of computer graphics to speed up the finite-element method\n(FEM). For the fluid simulation, we use a U-Net architecture trained with a\nphysics-based loss function to predict the flow field at each time step. The\npressure and velocity field outputs from the neural network are sampled around\nthe boundary of our swimmer using an immersed boundary method (IBM) to compute\nits swimming motion accurately and efficiently. We demonstrate the\ncomputational efficiency and differentiability of our hybrid simulator on a 2D\ncarangiform swimmer. Since both the solid simulator and the hydrodynamics model\nare automatically differentiable, we obtain a fully differentiable FSI\nsimulator that can be used for computational co-design of geometry and controls\nfor rigid and soft bodies immersed in fluids, such as minimizing drag,\nmaximizing speed, or maximizing efficiency via direct gradient-based\noptimization.",

    "abstract": "Chemical plant design and optimisation have proven challenging due to the\ncomplexity of these real-world systems. The resulting complexity translates\ninto high computational costs for these systems' mathematical formulations and\nsimulation models. Research has illustrated the benefits of using machine\nlearning surrogate models as substitutes for computationally expensive models\nduring optimisation. This paper extends recent research into optimising\nchemical plant design and operation. The study further explores Surrogate\nAssisted Genetic Algorithms (SA-GA) in more complex variants of the original\nplant design and optimisation problems, such as the inclusion of parallel and\nfeedback components. The novel extension to the original algorithm proposed in\nthis study, Surrogate Assisted NSGA-\\Romannum{2} (SA-NSGA), was tested on a\npopular literature case, the Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) system. We further\nprovide extensive experimentation, comparing various meta-heuristic\noptimisation techniques and numerous machine learning models as surrogates. The\nresults for both sets of systems illustrate the benefits of using Genetic\nAlgorithms as an optimisation framework for complex chemical plant system\ndesign and optimisation for both single and multi-objective scenarios. We\nconfirm that Random Forest surrogate assisted Evolutionary Algorithms can be\nscaled to increasingly complex chemical systems with parallel and feedback\ncomponents. We further find that combining a Genetic Algorithm framework with\nMachine Learning Surrogate models as a substitute for long-running simulation\nmodels yields significant computational efficiency improvements, 1.7 - 1.84\ntimes speedup for the increased complexity examples and a 2.7 times speedup for\nthe Pressure Swing Adsorption system.",

In practice, the thresholds and\nrates of throttling can appear and may be somewhat arbitrary. In this paper, we\nevaluate the choice of threshold and rate as an optimization problem (regret\nminimization) and demonstrate that intuitive formulations of client regret,\nwhich preserve desirable fairness properties, lead to optimization problems\nthat have tractably computable solutions.\nWe begin by exploring the effectiveness of using thresholding mechanisms to\nmodulate overall bandwidth consumption. Next, we separately consider the regret\nof heterogeneous users who are {\\em streamers}, wishing to view content over a\nfinite period of fixed rates, and users who are {\\em file downloaders},\ndesiring a fixed amount of bandwidth per month at their highest obtainable\nrate. We extend our analysis to a game-theoretic setting where users can choose\nfrom a variety of plans that vary the cap on the unbounded-rate data, and\ndemonstrate the convergence of the game. Our model provides a fresh perspective\non a fair allocation of resources where the demand is higher than capacity,\nwhile focusing on the real-world phenomena of bandwidth throttling practiced by\nISPs.

Poor scalability is one of the barriers to utilizing PINNs for many\nreal-world problems. To address this, a Self-scalable tanh (Stan) activation\nfunction is proposed for the PINNs. The proposed Stan function is smooth,\nnon-saturating, and has a trainable parameter.

It is also shown theoretically\nthat the PINN with the proposed Stan function has no spurious stationary points\nwhen using gradient descent algorithms. The proposed Stan is tested on a couple\nof numerical studies involving general regression problems. It is subsequently\nused for solving multiple forward problems, which involve second-order\nderivatives and multiple dimensions, and an inverse problem where the thermal\ndiffusivity is predicted through heat conduction in a rod.

Consequently, humans and machines are prone to mistake\nmorphs made from two identities for either of the faces used to create the\nmorph. This vulnerability has been exploited in \"morph attacks\" in security\nscenarios. Here, we asked whether the \"other-race effect\" (ORE) -- the human\nadvantage for identifying own- vs. other-race faces -- exacerbates morph attack\nsusceptibility for humans. We also asked whether face-identification\nperformance in a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is affected by the\nrace of morphed faces. Caucasian (CA) and East-Asian (EA) participants\nperformed a face-identity matching task on pairs of CA and EA face images in\ntwo conditions. In the morph condition, different-identity pairs consisted of\nan image of identity \"A\" and a 50/50 morph between images of identity \"A\" and\n\"B\". In the baseline condition, morphs of different identities never appeared.\nAs expected, morphs were identified mistakenly more often than original face\nimages. Moreover, CA participants showed an advantage for CA faces in\ncomparison to EA faces (a partial ORE). Of primary interest, morph\nidentification was substantially worse for cross-race faces than for own-race\nfaces. Similar to humans, the DCNN performed more accurately for original face\nimages than for morphed image pairs. Notably, the deep network proved\nsubstantially more accurate than humans in both cases. The results point to the\npossibility that DCNNs might be useful for improving face identification\naccuracy when morphed faces are presented.

A probability\ndistribution is used to capture the uncertainty of the decision process for\neach terrain patch. The distributions are updated as information from different\naltitudes is collected. When the confidence level for one of the patches\nbecomes larger than a pre-specified threshold, suitability for landing is\ndeclared. One of the main building blocks of the approach is a semantic\nsegmentation algorithm that attaches probabilities to each pixel of a single\nview.

    "abstract": "Residential segregation in metropolitan areas is a phenomenon that can be\nobserved all over the world. It is characterized by the emergence of large\nregions populated by residents that are homogeneous in terms of ethnicity or\nother traits. In a recent research trend in the AI community this phenomenon\nwas investigated via game-theoretic models. There, selfish agents of two types\nare equipped with a monotone utility function that ensures higher utility if an\nagent has more same-type neighbors. The agents strategically choose their\nlocation on a given graph that serves as residential area to maximize their\nutility. However, sociological polls suggest that real-world agents are\nactually favoring mixed-type neighborhoods, and hence should be modeled via\nnon-monotone utility functions.\nWe study Swap Schelling Games with non-monotone utility functions that are\nsingle-peaked. In these games pairs of agents may improve their utility by\nswapping their locations. Our main finding is that tolerance, i.e., that the\nagents favor fifty-fifty neighborhoods or even being in the minority, is\nnecessary for equilibrium existence on almost regular or bipartite graphs. We\nshow equilibrium existence on almost regular graphs via a potential function\nargument and we prove that this approach is impossible on arbitrary graphs even\nwith tolerant agents. Regarding the quality of equilibria, we consider the\nrecently introduced degree of integration, that counts the number of agents\nthat live in a heterogeneous neighborhood, as social welfare function. We\nderive (almost) tight bounds on the Price of Anarchy and the Price of\nStability. In particular, we show that the latter is constant on bipartite and\nalmost regular graphs.

In this work, we leverage the low communication latency of a new\nNIC/CPU hardware design, the nanoPU, to explore a new extreme of granularity in\ndistributed computation, where a problem is partitioned into tens of thousands\nof nanosecond-scale tasks.\nTo evaluate the feasibility and practicality of extremely fine-grained\ncomputing, we built NanoSort, a distributed sorting algorithm running on the\nnanoPU.

    "abstract": "We consider a rate-constrained contextual multi-armed bandit (RC-CMAB)\nproblem, in which a group of agents are solving the same contextual multi-armed\nbandit (CMAB) problem. However, the contexts are observed by a remotely\nconnected entity, i.e., the decision-maker, that updates the policy to maximize\nthe returned rewards, and communicates the arms to be sampled by the agents to\na controller over a rate-limited communications channel. This framework can be\napplied to personalized ad placement, whenever the content owner observes the\nwebsite visitors, and hence has the context, but needs to transmit the ads to\nbe shown to a controller that is in charge of placing the marketing content.\nConsequently, the rate-constrained CMAB (RC-CMAB) problem requires the study of\nlossy compression schemes for the policy to be employed whenever the constraint\non the channel rate does not allow the uncompressed transmission of the\ndecision-maker's intentions. We characterize the fundamental information\ntheoretic limits of this problem by letting the number of agents go to\ninfinity, and study the regret that can be achieved, identifying the two\ndistinct rate regions leading to linear and sub-linear regrets respectively. We\nthen analyze the optimal compression scheme achievable in the limit with\ninfinite agents, when using the forward and reverse KL divergence as distortion\nmetric.

    "abstract": "Early fault detection (EFD) of rolling bearings can recognize slight\ndeviation of the health states and contribute to the stability of mechanical\nsystems. In practice, very limited target bearing data are available to conduct\nEFD, which makes it hard to adapt to the EFD task of new bearings. To address\nthis problem, many transfer learning based EFD methods utilize historical data\nto learn transferable domain knowledge and conduct early fault detection on new\ntarget bearings. However, most existing methods only consider the distribution\ndrift across different working conditions but ignore the difference between\nbearings under the same working condition, which is called Unit-to-Unit\nVariability (UtUV). The setting of EFD with limited target data considering\nUtUV can be formulated as a Few-shot Anomaly Detection task. Therefore, this\npaper proposes a novel EFD method based on meta-learning considering UtUV. The\nproposed method can learn a generic metric based on Relation Network (RN) to\nmeasure the similarity between normal data and the new arrival target bearing\ndata. Besides, the proposed method utilizes a health state embedding strategy\nto decrease false alarms. The performance of proposed method is tested on two\nbearing datasets. The results show that the proposed method can detect\nincipient faults earlier than the baselines with lower false alarms.",

    "abstract": "The electric power grid has evolved significantly over the past two decades\nin response to climate change. Increased levels of renewable energy generation,\nas a prominent feature of this evolution, have led to new congestion patterns\nin the transmission network. The transmission system is originally designed for\nconventional energy sources, with predictable flow patterns. Insufficient\ntransfer capability in congested transmission systems results in commitment of\nmore expensive power plants and higher levels of renewable energy curtailment.\nOne way to mitigate congestion is adoption of power flow control through\nvariable-impedance flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) devices. In this\npaper the impacts of power flow control on generation cost, carbon emissions\nand renewable energy curtailment are studied under a wide range of scenarios,\nincluding generation mix from major US regional transmission organizations, and\ndifferent load curves, representing seasonal variations. A two-stage stochastic\nunit commitment, including FACTS adjustment, is used to evaluate the impacts of\nFACTS devices on various types and penetration levels of renewable energy. The\nresults show that FACTS installation effectively reduces generation cost,\ncarbon emissions, and renewable energy curtailment. Location of renewable\nenergy resources, peak-hour demand and the system's generation mix are among\nthe influential factors.",

    "abstract": "The circular cartogram, also known as the Dorling map, is a widely used tool\nto visualize statistical data. The circular cartogram represents regions as\ncircles with their sizes in proportion to the statistical values, and these\ncircles are displaced with quality requirements such as no overlaps and\ncontiguity maintenance satisfied. The displacement is a basic operation in\ncartographic generalization to fulfill map requirements, and many algorithms\nfor map objects' displacements have been introduced. The circles in a circular\ncartogram can also be considered as map objects. Thus, we develop a new\napproach by using the elastic beam displacement algorithm in cartographic\ngeneralization to displace circles in circular cartogram production. First, the\ninitial circles are generated with their sizes in proportion to the statistical\nvalues to avoid huge gaps or overlaps. Second, an elastic beam structure is\nbuilt as a proximity graph by analyzing the spatial relationships between the\ncircles. Third, the circles violating the quality requirements are considered\nto have a force on the node of a beam. Fourth, the elastic beam algorithm to\nachieve global optimization is applied to assign forces for each node to decide\nthe new positions of the circles. Steps 2 to 4 are repeated until a circular\ncartogram that satisfies the defined quality requirements is obtained. The\nevaluation results indicate that the circular cartograms generated by the\nproposed approach have a higher quality for the maintenance of topology\nrelations, contiguities, and relative relations with smaller displacement\ndistances compared to the existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Classical accuracy-oriented Recommender Systems (RSs) typically face the\ncold-start problem and the filter-bubble problem when users suffer the\nfamiliar, repeated, and even predictable recommendations, making them boring\nand unsatisfied. To address the above issues, serendipity-oriented RSs are\nproposed to recommend appealing and valuable items significantly deviating from\nusers' historical interactions and thus satisfying them by introducing\nunexplored but relevant candidate items to them. In this paper, we devise a\nnovel serendipity-oriented recommender system (\\textbf{G}enerative\n\\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{S}erendipity \\textbf{R}ecommender \\textbf{S}ystem,\n\\textbf{GS$^2$-RS}) that generates users' self-serendipity preferences to\nenhance the recommendation performance. Specifically, this model extracts\nusers' interest and satisfaction preferences, generates virtual but convincible\nneighbors' preferences from themselves, and achieves their self-serendipity\npreference. Then these preferences are injected into the rating matrix as\nadditional information for RS models. Note that GS$^2$-RS can not only tackle\nthe cold-start problem but also provides diverse but relevant recommendations\nto relieve the filter-bubble problem. Extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets illustrate that the proposed GS$^2$-RS model can significantly\noutperform the state-of-the-art baseline approaches in serendipity measures\nwith a stable accuracy performance.",

As a result, Google, the most widely used search engine in the United\nStates, experienced a surge in online shopping of remote learning-based\nsoftware, systems, applications, and gadgets by both educators and students\nfrom all the 50-United States, due to both these groups responding to the\nassociated needs and demands related to switching to remote teaching and\nlearning. This paper aims to investigate, analyze, and interpret these trends\nof Google Shopping related to remote learning that emerged since March 13,\n2020, on account of COVID-19 and the subsequent remote learning adoption in\nalmost all schools, colleges, and universities, from all the 50-United States.\nThe study was performed using Google Trends, which helps to track and study\nGoogle Shopping-based online activity emerging from different geolocations. The\nresults and discussions show that the highest interest related to Remote\nLearning-based Google Shopping was recorded from Oregon, which was followed by\nIllinois, Florida, Texas, California, and the other states.",

    "abstract": "Graph clustering discovers groups or communities within networks. Deep\nlearning methods such as autoencoders (AE) extract effective clustering and\ndownstream representations but cannot incorporate rich structural information.\nWhile Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have shown great success in encoding graph\nstructure, typical GNNs based on convolution or attention variants suffer from\nover-smoothing, noise, heterophily, are computationally expensive and typically\nrequire the complete graph being present. Instead, we propose Self-Supervised\nContrastive Graph Clustering (SCGC), which imposes graph-structure via\ncontrastive loss signals to learn discriminative node representations and\niteratively refined soft cluster labels. We also propose SCGC*, with a more\neffective, novel, Influence Augmented Contrastive (IAC) loss to fuse richer\nstructural information, and half the original model parameters. SCGC(*) is\nfaster with simple linear units, completely eliminate convolutions and\nattention of traditional GNNs, yet efficiently incorporates structure. It is\nimpervious to layer depth and robust to over-smoothing, incorrect edges and\nheterophily. It is scalable by batching, a limitation in many prior GNN models,\nand trivially parallelizable. We obtain significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art on a wide range of benchmark graph datasets, including images,\nsensor data, text, and citation networks efficiently. Specifically, 20% on ARI\nand 18% on NMI for DBLP; overall 55% reduction in training time and overall,\n81% reduction on inference time. Our code is available at :\nhttps://github.com/gayanku/SCGC",

In this\npaper, we propose and explore a new multi-modal extension of test-time\nadaptation for 3D semantic segmentation. We find that directly applying\nexisting methods usually results in performance instability at test time\nbecause multi-modal input is not considered jointly. To design a framework that\ncan take full advantage of multi-modality, where each modality provides\nregularized self-supervisory signals to other modalities, we propose two\ncomplementary modules within and across the modalities. First, Intra-modal\nPseudolabel Generation (Intra-PG) is introduced to obtain reliable pseudo\nlabels within each modality by aggregating information from two models that are\nboth pre-trained on source data but updated with target data at different\npaces. Second, Inter-modal Pseudo-label Refinement (Inter-PR) adaptively\nselects more reliable pseudo labels from different modalities based on a\nproposed consistency scheme. Experiments demonstrate that our regularized\npseudo labels produce stable self-learning signals in numerous multi-modal\ntest-time adaptation scenarios for 3D semantic segmentation.

    "abstract": "Neural text matching models have been used in a range of applications such as\nquestion answering and natural language inference, and have yielded a good\nperformance. However, these neural models are of a limited adaptability,\nresulting in a decline in performance when encountering test examples from a\ndifferent dataset or even a different task. The adaptability is particularly\nimportant in the few-shot setting: in many cases, there is only a limited\namount of labeled data available for a target dataset or task, while we may\nhave access to a richly labeled source dataset or task. However, adapting a\nmodel trained on the abundant source data to a few-shot target dataset or task\nis challenging. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Meta-Weight Regulator\n(MWR), which is a meta-learning approach that learns to assign weights to the\nsource examples based on their relevance to the target loss. Specifically, MWR\nfirst trains the model on the uniformly weighted source examples, and measures\nthe efficacy of the model on the target examples via a loss function. By\niteratively performing a (meta) gradient descent, high-order gradients are\npropagated to the source examples. These gradients are then used to update the\nweights of source examples, in a way that is relevant to the target\nperformance. As MWR is model-agnostic, it can be applied to any backbone neural\nmodel. Extensive experiments are conducted with various backbone text matching\nmodels, on four widely used datasets and two tasks. The results demonstrate\nthat our proposed approach significantly outperforms a number of existing\nadaptation methods and effectively improves the cross-dataset and cross-task\nadaptability of the neural text matching models in the few-shot setting.",

    "abstract": "Deep operator networks (DeepONets) are powerful architectures for fast and\naccurate emulation of complex dynamics. As their remarkable generalization\ncapabilities are primarily enabled by their projection-based attribute, we\ninvestigate connections with low-rank techniques derived from the singular\nvalue decomposition (SVD). We demonstrate that some of the concepts behind\nproper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-neural networks can improve DeepONet's\ndesign and training phases. These ideas lead us to a methodology extension that\nwe name SVD-DeepONet. Moreover, through multiple SVD analyses, we find that\nDeepONet inherits from its projection-based attribute strong inefficiencies in\nrepresenting dynamics characterized by symmetries. Inspired by the work on\nshifted-POD, we develop flexDeepONet, an architecture enhancement that relies\non a pre-transformation network for generating a moving reference frame and\nisolating the rigid components of the dynamics. In this way, the physics can be\nrepresented on a latent space free from rotations, translations, and stretches,\nand an accurate projection can be performed to a low-dimensional basis. In\naddition to flexibility and interpretability, the proposed perspectives\nincrease DeepONet's generalization capabilities and computational efficiencies.\nFor instance, we show flexDeepONet can accurately surrogate the dynamics of 19\nvariables in a combustion chemistry application by relying on 95% less\ntrainable parameters than the ones of the vanilla architecture. We argue that\nDeepONet and SVD-based methods can reciprocally benefit from each other. In\nparticular, the flexibility of the former in leveraging multiple data sources\nand multifidelity knowledge in the form of both unstructured data and\nphysics-informed constraints has the potential to greatly extend the\napplicability of methodologies such as POD and PCA.",

    "title": "Density-preserving Deep Point Cloud Compression",
    "abstract": "Local density of point clouds is crucial for representing local details, but\nhas been overlooked by existing point cloud compression methods. To address\nthis, we propose a novel deep point cloud compression method that preserves\nlocal density information. Our method works in an auto-encoder fashion: the\nencoder downsamples the points and learns point-wise features, while the\ndecoder upsamples the points using these features. Specifically, we propose to\nencode local geometry and density with three embeddings: density embedding,\nlocal position embedding and ancestor embedding. During the decoding, we\nexplicitly predict the upsampling factor for each point, and the directions and\nscales of the upsampled points. To mitigate the clustered points issue in\nexisting methods, we design a novel sub-point convolution layer, and an\nupsampling block with adaptive scale. Furthermore, our method can also compress\npoint-wise attributes, such as normal. Extensive qualitative and quantitative\nresults on SemanticKITTI and ShapeNet demonstrate that our method achieves the\nstate-of-the-art rate-distortion trade-off.",

    "abstract": "The field of face anti-spoofing (FAS) has witnessed great progress with the\nsurge of deep learning. Due to its data-driven nature, existing FAS methods are\nsensitive to the noise in the dataset, which will hurdle the learning process.\nHowever, very few works consider noise modeling in FAS. In this work, we\nattempt to fill this gap by automatically addressing the noise problem from\nboth label and data perspectives in a probabilistic manner. Specifically, we\npropose a unified framework called Dual Probabilistic Modeling (DPM), with two\ndedicated modules, DPM-LQ (Label Quality aware learning) and DPM-DQ (Data\nQuality aware learning). Both modules are designed based on the assumption that\ndata and label should form coherent probabilistic distributions. DPM-LQ is able\nto produce robust feature representations without overfitting to the\ndistribution of noisy semantic labels. DPM-DQ can eliminate data noise from\n`False Reject' and `False Accept' during inference by correcting the prediction\nconfidence of noisy data based on its quality distribution. Both modules can be\nincorporated into existing deep networks seamlessly and efficiently.\nFurthermore, we propose the generalized DPM to address the noise problem in\npractical usage without the need of semantic annotations. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that this probabilistic modeling can 1) significantly improve the\naccuracy, and 2) make the model robust to the noise in real-world datasets.\nWithout bells and whistles, our proposed DPM achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on multiple standard FAS benchmarks.",

The complex\nagro-hydrological system dynamics, however, often pose challenges in\nclosed-loop control applications. In this work, we propose a two-layer neural\nnetwork (NN) framework to approximate the dynamics of the agro-hydrological\nsystem. To minimize the prediction error, a linear bias correction is added to\nthe proposed model. The model is employed by a model predictive controller with\nzone tracking (ZMPC), which aims to keep the root zone soil moisture in the\ntarget zone while minimizing the total amount of irrigation. The performance of\nthe proposed approximation model framework is shown to be better compared to a\nbenchmark long-short-term-memory (LSTM) model for both open-loop and\nclosed-loop applications. Significant computational cost reduction of the ZMPC\nis achieved with the proposed framework. To handle the tracking offset caused\nby the plant-model-mismatch of the proposed NN framework, a shrinking target\nzone is proposed for the ZMPC. Different hyper-parameters of the shrinking zone\nin the presence of noise and weather disturbances are investigated, of which\nthe control performance is compared to a ZMPC with a time-invariant target\nzone.",

To study the motion features\nin the latent space of StyleGAN, in this paper, we hypothesize and demonstrate\nthat a series of meaningful, natural, and versatile small, local movements\n(referred to as \"micromotion\", such as expression, head movement, and aging\neffect) can be represented in low-rank spaces extracted from the latent space\nof a conventionally pre-trained StyleGAN-v2 model for face generation, with the\nguidance of proper \"anchors\" in the form of either short text or video clips.\nStarting from one target face image, with the editing direction decoded from\nthe low-rank space, its micromotion features can be represented as simple as an\naffine transformation over its latent feature. Perhaps more surprisingly, such\nmicromotion subspace, even learned from just single target face, can be\npainlessly transferred to other unseen face images, even those from vastly\ndifferent domains (such as oil painting, cartoon, and sculpture faces). It\ndemonstrates that the local feature geometry corresponding to one type of\nmicromotion is aligned across different face subjects, and hence that\nStyleGAN-v2 is indeed \"secretly\" aware of the subject-disentangled feature\nvariations caused by that micromotion.

Most\nexisting FL algorithms require models of identical architecture to be deployed\nacross the clients and server, making it infeasible to train large models due\nto clients' limited system resources. In this work, we propose a novel ensemble\nknowledge transfer method named Fed-ET in which small models (different in\narchitecture) are trained on clients, and used to train a larger model at the\nserver. Unlike in conventional ensemble learning, in FL the ensemble can be\ntrained on clients' highly heterogeneous data.

Our experiments\non image and language tasks show that Fed-ET significantly outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art FL algorithms with fewer communicated parameters, and is also\nrobust against high data-heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that deep learning models in NLP are highly sensitive\nto low-level correlations between simple features and specific output labels,\nleading to overfitting and lack of generalization. To mitigate this problem, a\ncommon practice is to balance datasets by adding new instances or by filtering\nout \"easy\" instances (Sakaguchi et al., 2020), culminating in a recent proposal\nto eliminate single-word correlations altogether (Gardner et al., 2021). In\nthis opinion paper, we identify that despite these efforts,\nincreasingly-powerful models keep exploiting ever-smaller spurious\ncorrelations, and as a result even balancing all single-word features is\ninsufficient for mitigating all of these correlations. In parallel, a truly\nbalanced dataset may be bound to \"throw the baby out with the bathwater\" and\nmiss important signal encoding common sense and world knowledge. We highlight\nseveral alternatives to dataset balancing, focusing on enhancing datasets with\nricher contexts, allowing models to abstain and interact with users, and\nturning from large-scale fine-tuning to zero- or few-shot setups.",

We also collect the code snippets from 1,355,617 posts on SO.\nThen, we employ CCFinder to detect the code clone between the modified code\nfrom commits and the code from SO, and further analyze the code reuse when\nprogrammer solves a programming problem during development. We count the code\nreuse ratios of the modified code snippets in the commits of each project in\ndifferent years, the results show that the average code reuse ratio is 6.32%,\nand the maximum is 8.38%. The code reuse ratio in project commits has increased\nyear by year, and the proportion of code reuse in the newly established project\nis higher than that of old projects.

Two constructs, perceived\nextrinsic warm-glow (PEWG) and perceived intrinsic warm-glow (PIWG), were\nincorporated into the TAM3 model to measure the two dimensions of\nuser-experienced warm-glow, forming what we refer to as the TAM3+WG model. An\nexperimental approach was taken to evaluate the suitability of the proposed\nmodel (i.e., TAM3+WG). A vignette was used to describe a hypothetical internet\nsearch engine solution designed to evoke in participants warm-glow.

    "title": "Regularized Box-Simplex Games and Dynamic Decremental Bipartite Matching",
    "abstract": "Box-simplex games are a family of bilinear minimax objectives which\nencapsulate graph-structured problems such as maximum flow [She17], optimal\ntransport [JST19], and bipartite matching [AJJ+22]. We develop efficient\nnear-linear time, high-accuracy solvers for regularized variants of these\ngames. Beyond the immediate applications of such solvers for computing Sinkhorn\ndistances, a prominent tool in machine learning, we show that these solvers can\nbe used to obtain improved running times for maintaining a (fractional)\n$\\epsilon$-approximate maximum matching in a dynamic decremental bipartite\ngraph against an adaptive adversary. We give a generic framework which reduces\nthis dynamic matching problem to solving regularized graph-structured\noptimization problems to high accuracy. Through our reduction framework, our\nregularized box-simplex game solver implies a new algorithm for dynamic\ndecremental bipartite matching in total time $\\tilde{O}(m \\cdot\n\\epsilon^{-3})$, from an initial graph with $m$ edges and $n$ nodes. We further\nshow how to use recent advances in flow optimization [CKL+22] to improve our\nruntime to $m^{1 + o(1)} \\cdot \\epsilon^{-2}$, thereby demonstrating the\nversatility of our reduction-based approach. These results improve upon the\nprevious best runtime of $\\tilde{O}(m \\cdot \\epsilon^{-4})$ [BGS20] and\nillustrate the utility of using regularized optimization problem solvers for\ndesigning dynamic algorithms.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the gap between the classical pricing theory and the\ndata-based pricing theory. We focus on the problem of price discrimination with\na continuum of buyer types based on a finite sample of observations. Our first\nset of results provides sharp lower bounds in the worst-case scenario for the\ndiscrepancy between any data-based pricing strategies and the theoretical\noptimal third-degree price discrimination (3PD) strategy (respectively, uniform\npricing strategy) derived from the distribution (where the sample is drawn)\nranging over a large class of distributions. Consequently, there is an\ninevitable gap between revenues based on any data-based pricing strategy and\nthe revenue based on the theoretical optimal 3PD (respectively, uniform\npricing) strategy. We then propose easy-to-implement data-based 3PD and uniform\npricing strategies and show each strategy is minimax optimal in the sense that\nthe gap between their respective revenue and the revenue based on the\ntheoretical optimal 3PD (respectively, uniform pricing) strategy matches our\nworst-case lower bounds up to constant factors (that are independent of the\nsample size $n$). We show that 3PD strategies are revenue superior to uniform\npricing strategies if and only if the sample size $n$ is large enough. In other\nwords, if $n$ is below a threshold, uniform pricing strategies are revenue\nsuperior to 3PD strategies. We further provide upper bounds for the gaps\nbetween the welfare generated by our minimax optimal 3PD (respectively, uniform\npricing) strategy and the welfare based on the theoretical optimal 3PD\n(respectively, uniform pricing) strategy.",

    "abstract": "Neural architecture search (NAS) aims to automate architecture engineering in\nneural networks. This often requires a high computational overhead to evaluate\na number of candidate networks from the set of all possible networks in the\nsearch space during the search. Prediction of the networks' performance can\nalleviate this high computational overhead by mitigating the need for\nevaluating every candidate network. Developing such a predictor typically\nrequires a large number of evaluated architectures which may be difficult to\nobtain. We address this challenge by proposing a novel evolutionary-based NAS\nstrategy, Predictor-assisted E-NAS (PRE-NAS), which can perform well even with\nan extremely small number of evaluated architectures. PRE-NAS leverages new\nevolutionary search strategies and integrates high-fidelity weight inheritance\nover generations. Unlike one-shot strategies, which may suffer from bias in the\nevaluation due to weight sharing, offspring candidates in PRE-NAS are\ntopologically homogeneous, which circumvents bias and leads to more accurate\npredictions. Extensive experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces\nshow that PRE-NAS can outperform state-of-the-art NAS methods. With only a\nsingle GPU searching for 0.6 days, competitive architecture can be found by\nPRE-NAS which achieves 2.40% and 24% test error rates on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet\nrespectively.",

However, two main issues remain\nfor existing pre-training methods: 1) the learned representation is neutral and\nnot informative for a specific task; 2) multi-task learning-based pre-training\nsometimes leads to sub-optimal solutions due to inconsistent domains of\ndifferent tasks. To address the above issues, we propose a novel action\nrecognition pre-training framework, which exploits human-centered prior\nknowledge that generates more informative representation, and avoids the\nconflict between multiple tasks by using task-dependent representations.\nSpecifically, we distill knowledge from a human parsing model to enrich the\nsemantic capability of representation. In addition, we combine knowledge\ndistillation with contrastive learning to constitute a task-dependent\nmulti-task framework.

    "abstract": "Nested named entity recognition (nested NER) is a fundamental task in natural\nlanguage processing. Various span-based methods have been proposed to detect\nnested entities with span representations. However, span-based methods do not\nconsider the relationship between a span and other entities or phrases, which\nis helpful in the NER task. Besides, span-based methods have trouble predicting\nlong entities due to limited span enumeration length. To mitigate these issues,\nwe present the Propose-and-Refine Network (PnRNet), a two-stage set prediction\nnetwork for nested NER. In the propose stage, we use a span-based predictor to\ngenerate some coarse entity predictions as entity proposals. In the refine\nstage, proposals interact with each other, and richer contextual information is\nincorporated into the proposal representations. The refined proposal\nrepresentations are used to re-predict entity boundaries and classes. In this\nway, errors in coarse proposals can be eliminated, and the boundary prediction\nis no longer constrained by the span enumeration length limitation.\nAdditionally, we build multi-scale sentence representations, which better model\nthe hierarchical structure of sentences and provide richer contextual\ninformation than token-level representations.

    "abstract": "Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms have\nbeen widely used in image denoising and achieved satisfactory performance.\nHowever, the previous works mostly use a single head to receive the noisy\nimage, limiting the richness of extracted features. Therefore, a novel CNN with\nmultiple heads (MH) named MHCNN is proposed in this paper, whose heads will\nreceive the input images rotated by different rotation angles. MH makes MHCNN\nsimultaneously utilize features of rotated images to remove noise. We also\npresent a novel multi-path attention mechanism (MPA) to integrate these\nfeatures effectively.

Its peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) results are higher than other\nnetworks, such as DnCNN, BRDNet, RIDNet, PAN-Net, and CSANN.

However,\nexisting methods require rich yet costly label annotations to obtain robust\nmodels, which limits the use for practical applications. To this end, we study\nan unsupervised scenario by proposing a novel Self-supervised Text Erasing\n(STE) framework that jointly learns to synthesize training images with erasure\nground-truth and accurately erase texts in the real world. We first design a\nstyle-aware image synthesis function to generate synthetic images with diverse\nstyled texts based on two synthetic mechanisms. To bridge the text style gap\nbetween the synthetic and real-world data, a policy network is constructed to\ncontrol the synthetic mechanisms by picking style parameters with the guidance\nof two specifically designed rewards. The synthetic training images with\nerasure ground-truth are then fed to train a coarse-to-fine erasing network. To\nproduce better erasing outputs, a triplet erasure loss is designed to enforce\nthe refinement stage to recover background textures. Moreover, we provide a new\ndataset (called PosterErase), which contains 60K high-resolution posters with\ntexts and is more challenging for the text erasing task. The proposed method\nhas been extensively evaluated with both PosterErase and the widely-used\nSCUT-Enstext dataset.

When playing MOBA\ngames, players go through a draft stage, where they alternately select a\nvirtual character to play.

To\nalleviate this problem, we propose DraftRec, a novel hierarchical model which\nrecommends characters by considering each player's champion preferences and the\ninteraction between the players. DraftRec consists of two networks: the player\nnetwork and the match network.

The scheme has been used in various\nengineering areas with different approximations in spatial direction. The\nlowest-order mixed method is the most popular one for miscible flow in porous\nmedia. The method is based on a linear Lagrange approximation to the\nconcentration and the zero-order Raviart-Thomas approximation to the\npressure/velocity. However, the optimal error estimate for the lowest-order\ncharacteristics-mixed FEM has not been presented although numerous effort has\nbeen made in last several decades. In all previous works, only first-order\naccuracy in spatial direction was proved under certain time-step and mesh size\nrestrictions. The main purpose of this paper is to establish optimal error\nestimates, $i.e.$, the second-order in $L^2$-norm for the concentration and the\nfirst-order for the pressure/velocity, while the concentration is more\nimportant physical component for the underlying model. For this purpose, an\nelliptic quasi-projection is introduced in our analysis to clean up the\npollution of the numerical velocity through the nonlinear dispersion-diffusion\ntensor and the concentration-dependent viscosity. Moreover, the numerical\npressure/velocity of the second-order accuracy can be obtained by re-solving\nthe (elliptic) pressure equation at a given time level with a higher-order\napproximation.

    "abstract": "Bots are becoming a popular method for automating basic everyday tasks in\nmany software projects. This is true in particular because of the availability\nof many off-the-shelf task-specific bots that teams can quickly adopt (which\nare sometimes completed with additional task-specific custom bots). Based on\nour experience in the Coq project, where we have developed and maintained a\nmulti-task project-specific bot, we argue that this alternative approach to\nproject automation should receive more attention because it strikes a good\nbalance between productivity and adaptibility. In this article, we describe the\nkind of automation that our bot implements, what advantages we have gained by\nmaintaining a project-specific bot, and the technology and architecture choices\nthat have made it possible. We draw conclusions that should generalize to other\nmedium-sized software teams willing to invest in project automation without\ndisrupting their workflows.",

In this setting, losses of an action are split into $d$ components,\nspreading over consecutive rounds after the action is chosen. And in each\nround, the algorithm observes the aggregation of losses that come from the\nlatest $d$ rounds. Previous works focus on oblivious adversarial setting, while\nwe investigate the harder non-oblivious setting. We show non-oblivious setting\nincurs $\\Omega(T)$ pseudo regret even when the loss sequence is bounded memory.\nHowever, we propose a wrapper algorithm which enjoys $o(T)$ policy regret on\nmany adversarial bandit problems with the assumption that the loss sequence is\nbounded memory. Especially, for $K$-armed bandit and bandit convex\noptimization, we have $\\mathcal{O}(T^{2/3})$ policy regret bound. We also prove\na matching lower bound for $K$-armed bandit. Our lower bound works even when\nthe loss sequence is oblivious but the delay is non-oblivious.

However, constrained by the limited data\navailable in the audio domain, most transformer-based models for audio tasks\nare finetuned from pre-trained models in other domains (e.g. image), which has\na notable gap with the audio domain. Other methods explore the self-supervised\nlearning approaches directly in the audio domain but currently do not perform\nwell in the downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a novel self-supervised\nlearning method for transformer-based audio models, called masked spectrogram\nprediction (MaskSpec), to learn powerful audio representations from unlabeled\naudio data (AudioSet used in this paper). Our method masks random patches of\nthe input spectrogram and reconstructs the masked regions with an\nencoder-decoder architecture. Without using extra model weights or supervision,\nexperimental results on multiple downstream datasets demonstrate MaskSpec\nachieves a significant performance gain against the supervised methods and\noutperforms the previous pre-trained models.

    "abstract": "Radio-frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is a scarce resource.\nCognitive radio technology has emerged as a promising solution to overcome the\nspectrum scarcity bottleneck. Through this technology, secondary users (SUs)\nsense the spectrum opportunities free from primary users (PUs), and\nopportunistically take advantage of these (temporarily) idle portions, known as\nspectrum holes. In this correspondence, we consider a variant of the cognitive\nradio resource allocation problem posed by Martinovic et al. in 2017. The\ndistinguishing feature of this version of the problem is that each SU, due to\nits hardware limitations, imposes the requirement that the to-be-aggregated\nspectrum holes cannot be arbitrarily far from each other. We call this\nrestriction as the Maximal Aggregation Range (MAR) constraint, and refer to\nthis variant of the problem as the MAR-constrained hole assignment problem. The\nproblem can be formalized as an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. We\npropose a novel binary integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to the\nproblem. The number of constraints in this formulation is the number of\nspectrum holes plus the number of SUs. On the other hand, the number of binary\ndecision variables in the formulation can be prohibitively large, as for each\nlegitimate spectrum allocation to each SU, one variable is needed. We propose a\nbranch-and-price (B&P) framework to tackle this challenge. This framework is in\nfact a branch-and-bound procedure in which at each node of the search tree, we\nutilize the so-called (delayed) column generation technique for solving the LP\nrelaxation of the corresponding subproblem. As evidenced by the numerical\nresults, the LP relaxation bounds are very tight. This allows for a very\neffective pruning of the search space. Compared to the previously suggested\nformulations, the proposed technique can require much less computational\neffort.",

Deployment of ML within large\nsoftware systems brings new challenges that are not addressed by standard\nengineering practices and as a result businesses observe high rate of ML\ndeployment project failures. Data Oriented Architecture (DOA) is an emerging\napproach that can support data scientists and software developers when\naddressing such challenges.

This paper proposes to consider\nFlow-Based Programming (FBP) as a paradigm for creating DOA applications. We\nempirically evaluate FBP in the context of ML deployment on four applications\nthat represent typical data science projects. We use Service Oriented\nArchitecture (SOA) as a baseline for comparison. Evaluation is done with\nrespect to different application domains, ML deployment stages, and code\nquality metrics. Results reveal that FBP is a suitable paradigm for data\ncollection and data science tasks, and is able to simplify data collection and\ndiscovery when compared with SOA.

Therefore, we\nintroduce the concept of Scope, which outlines a structural text region related\nto a specific target.

Then, we\nshow analytically that AFDM can achieve full diversity in doubly dispersive\nchannels, where full diversity refers to the number of multipath components\nseparable in either the delay or the Doppler domain, due to its full\ndelay-Doppler representation. Furthermore, we present a low complexity\ndetection method taking advantage of zero-padding. We also propose an embedded\npilot-aided channel estimation scheme for AFDM, in which both channel\nestimation and data detection are performed within the same AFDM frame.\nFinally, simulations corroborate the validity of our analytical results and\nshow the significant performance gains of AFDM over state-of-the-art\nmulticarrier schemes in high mobility scenarios.",

In this paper, we probe simile\nknowledge from PLMs to solve the SI and SG tasks in the unified framework of\nsimile triple completion for the first time. The backbone of our framework is\nto construct masked sentences with manual patterns and then predict the\ncandidate words in the masked position. In this framework, we adopt a secondary\ntraining process (Adjective-Noun mask Training) with the masked language model\n(MLM) loss to enhance the prediction diversity of candidate words in the masked\nposition. Moreover, pattern ensemble (PE) and pattern search (PS) are applied\nto improve the quality of predicted words.

However, these all assumptions are difficult to hold in practical\nsettings because the target task rarely has the same labels as the source task,\nthe source dataset access is restricted due to licensing and storage costs, and\nthe target architecture is often specialized to each task. To transfer source\nknowledge without these assumptions, we propose a transfer learning method that\nuses deep generative models and is composed of the following two stages: pseudo\npre-training (PP) and pseudo semi-supervised learning (P-SSL). PP trains a\ntarget architecture with a synthesized dataset by using conditional source\ngenerative models. P-SSL applies SSL algorithms to labeled target data and\nunlabeled pseudo samples, which are generated by cascading the source\nclassifier and generative models to condition them with target samples. Our\nexperimental results indicate that our method can outperform baselines of\nscratch training and knowledge distillation.",

The query embedding method is proposed to answer these queries by\njointly encoding queries and entities to the same embedding space. Then the\nanswer entities are selected according to the similarities between the entity\nembeddings and the query embedding. As the answers to a complex query are\nobtained from a combination of logical operations over sub-queries, the\nembeddings of the answer entities may not always follow a uni-modal\ndistribution in the embedding space. Thus, it is challenging to simultaneously\nretrieve a set of diverse answers from the embedding space using a single and\nconcentrated query representation such as a vector or a hyper-rectangle. To\nbetter cope with queries with diversified answers, we propose Query2Particles\n(Q2P), a complex KG query answering method. Q2P encodes each query into\nmultiple vectors, named particle embeddings. By doing so, the candidate answers\ncan be retrieved from different areas over the embedding space using the\nmaximal similarities between the entity embeddings and any of the particle\nembeddings. Meanwhile, the corresponding neural logic operations are defined to\nsupport its reasoning over arbitrary first-order logic queries.

Although\nwe find that some discarded queries in MS MARCO are ill-defined or otherwise\nunanswerable, many are valid questions that could be answered had the\ncollection been annotated more completely (around two thirds using modern\nranking techniques). This survivability problem distorts the MS MARCO\ncollection in several ways. We find that it affects the natural distribution of\nqueries in terms of the type of information needed. When used for evaluation,\nwe find that the bias likely yields a significant distortion of the absolute\nperformance scores observed. Finally, given that MS MARCO is frequently used\nfor model training, we train models based on subsets of MS MARCO that simulates\nmore survivorship bias. We find that models trained in this setting are up to\n9.9% worse when evaluated on versions of the dataset with more complete\nannotations, and up to 3.5% worse at zero-shot transfer.

We consider the problem of\nconstructive control by replacing voters (CCRV) introduced by Loreggia et al.\n(2015) for the scoring rule First-Last, which is defined by $\\langle 1, 0,\n\\dots, 0, -1\\rangle$.

So on the one hand, if CCRV for First-Last is\nNP-complete then RP = NP, which is extremely unlikely. On the other hand,\nshowing that CCRV for First-Last is in P would also show that EPBM is in P,\nwhich would solve a well-studied 40-year-old open problem.\nConsidering RP as an option for classifying problems can also help classify\nproblems that until now had escaped classification. For example, the sole open\nproblem in the comprehensive table from Erd\\'{e}lyi et al. (2021) is CCRV for\n2-Approval.

    "abstract": "Rationality has been an intriguing topic for several decades. Even the scope\nof definition of rationality across different subjects varies. Several theories\n(e.g., game theory) initially evolved on the basis that agents (e.g., humans)\nare perfectly rational. One interpretation of perfect rationality is that\nagents always make the optimal decision which maximizes their expected\nutilities. However, subsequently this assumption was relaxed to include bounded\nrationality where agents have limitations in terms of computing resources and\nbiases which prevents them to take the optimal decision. However, with recent\nadvances in (quantum) computing, artificial intelligence (AI), science and\ntechnology etc., has led to the thought that perhaps the concept of rationality\nwould be augmented with machine intelligence which will enable agents to take\ndecision optimally with higher regularity. However, there are divergent views\non this topic. The paper attempts to put forward a recent survey (last five\nyears) of research on these divergent views. These viewsmay be grouped into\nthree schools of thoughts. The first school is the one which is sceptical of\nprogress of AI and believes that human intelligencewill always supersede\nmachine intelligence. The second school of thought thinks that advent of AI and\nadvances in computing will help in better understanding of bounded rationality.\nThird school of thought believes that bounds of bounded rationality will be\nextended by advances in AI and various other fields.

    "abstract": "Spatial-Spectral Total Variation (SSTV) can quantify local smoothness of\nimage structures, so it is widely used in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing\ntasks. Essentially, SSTV assumes a sparse structure of gradient maps calculated\nalong the spatial and spectral directions. In fact, these gradient tensors are\nnot only sparse, but also (approximately) low-rank under FFT, which we have\nverified by numerical tests and theoretical analysis. Based on this fact, we\npropose a novel TV regularization to simultaneously characterize the sparsity\nand low-rank priors of the gradient map (LRSTV). The new regularization not\nonly imposes sparsity on the gradient map itself, but also penalize the rank on\nthe gradient map after Fourier transform along the spectral dimension. It\nnaturally encodes the sparsity and lowrank priors of the gradient map, and thus\nis expected to reflect the inherent structure of the original image more\nfaithfully. Further, we use LRSTV to replace conventional SSTV and embed it in\nthe HSI processing model to improve its performance. Experimental results on\nmultiple public data-sets with heavy mixed noise show that the proposed model\ncan get 1.5dB improvement of PSNR.",

    "title": "LiftPool: Lifting-based Graph Pooling for Hierarchical Graph  Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "Graph pooling has been increasingly considered for graph neural networks\n(GNNs) to facilitate hierarchical graph representation learning. Existing graph\npooling methods commonly consist of two stages, i.e., selecting the top-ranked\nnodes and removing the rest nodes to construct a coarsened graph\nrepresentation. However, local structural information of the removed nodes\nwould be inevitably dropped in these methods, due to the inherent coupling of\nnodes (location) and their features (signals). In this paper, we propose an\nenhanced three-stage method via lifting, named LiftPool, to improve\nhierarchical graph representation by maximally preserving the local structural\ninformation in graph pooling. LiftPool introduces an additional stage of graph\nlifting before graph coarsening to preserve the local information of the\nremoved nodes and decouple the processes of node removing and feature\nreduction. Specifically, for each node to be removed, its local information is\nobtained by subtracting the global information aggregated from its neighboring\npreserved nodes. Subsequently, this local information is aligned and propagated\nto the preserved nodes to alleviate information loss in graph coarsening.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed LiftPool is localized and\npermutation-invariant. The proposed graph lifting structure is general to be\nintegrated with existing downsampling-based graph pooling methods. Evaluations\non benchmark graph datasets show that LiftPool substantially outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art graph pooling methods in the task of graph classification.",

For the\nformer type, mean square error (MSE) is usually used which cannot provide\nstrong constraint for training and can make the model easy to be stuck into the\ncollapsed solution. For the later one, due to the down sampling operation and\nthe expansion of receptive fields, the details can be lost for local\ndescriptors can be lost, making the constraint not fine enough. Considering the\nissues above, we propose to combine both ideas, which including three aspects.\n1) We propose to achieve fine constraint based on the requirement of\nrepeatability while coarse constraint with guidance of deep convolution\nfeatures. 2) To address the issue that optimization with MSE is limited,\nentropy-based cost function is utilized, both soft cross-entropy and\nself-information. 3) With the guidance of convolution features, we define the\ncost function from both positive and negative sides.

With memory disaggregation, data center compute nodes can directly\naccess memory on adjacent nodes and are therefore able to overcome local memory\nrestrictions, introducing a new data management paradigm for distributed\ncomputing. This paper proposes and demonstrates a memory disaggregated\nin-memory object store framework for big data applications by leveraging the\nnewly introduced ThymesisFlow memory disaggregation system. The framework\nextends the functionality of the pre-existing Apache Arrow Plasma object store\nframework to distributed systems by enabling clients to easily and efficiently\nproduce and consume data objects across multiple compute nodes. This allows big\ndata applications to increasingly leverage parallel processing at reduced\ndevelopment costs. In addition, the paper includes latency and throughput\nmeasurements that indicate only a modest performance penalty is incurred for\nremote disaggregated memory access as opposed to local (~6.5 vs ~5.75 GiB/s).\nThe results can be used to guide the design of future systems that leverage\nmemory disaggregation as well as the newly presented framework.

    "abstract": "Software projects use Issue Tracking Systems (ITS) like JIRA to track issues\nand organize the workflows around them. Issues are often inter-connected via\ndifferent links such as the default JIRA link types Duplicate, Relate, Block,\nor Subtask. While previous research has mostly focused on analyzing and\npredicting duplication links, this work aims at understanding the various other\nlink types, their prevalence, and characteristics towards a more reliable link\ntype prediction. For this, we studied 607,208 links connecting 698,790 issues\nin 15 public JIRA repositories. Besides the default types, the custom types\nDepend, Incorporate, Split, and Cause were also common. We manually grouped all\n75 link types used in the repositories into five general categories: General\nRelation, Duplication, Composition, Temporal / Causal, and Workflow. Comparing\nthe structures of the corresponding graphs, we observed several trends. For\ninstance, Duplication links tend to represent simpler issue graphs often with\ntwo components and Composition links present the highest amount of hierarchical\ntree structures (97.7%). Surprisingly, General Relation links have a\nsignificantly higher transitivity score than Duplication and Temporal / Causal\nlinks. Motivated by the differences between the link types and by their\npopularity, we evaluated the robustness of two state-of-the-art duplicate\ndetection approaches from the literature on the JIRA dataset. We found that\ncurrent deep-learning approaches confuse between Duplication and other links in\nalmost all repositories. On average, the classification accuracy dropped by 6%\nfor one approach and 12% for the other. Extending the training sets with other\nlink types seems to partly solve this issue.

While there has been much research in information\nvisualization aiming at complex data transformation and novel presentation\ntechniques, relatively little has been done to understand how users derive\ninsights through interactive visualization of data. This paper presents a\ncrowdsourced study with 158 participants investigating the relation between\nentity-based interaction (an action + its target entity) and the resulting\ninsight. To this end, we generalized the interaction with an existing CO2\nExplorer as entity-based interaction and enabled users to input notes and refer\nto relevant entities to assist their narratives. We logged interactions of\nusers freely exploring the visualization and characterized their externalized\ninsights about the data. Using entity-based interactions and references to\ninfer insight characteristics (category, overview versus detail, and prior\nknowledge), we found evidence that compared with interactions, entity\nreferences improved insight characterization from slight/fair to fair/moderate\nagreements. To interpret prediction outcomes, feature importance and\ncorrelation analysis indicated that, e.g., detailed insights tended to have\nmore mouse-overs in the chart area and cite the vertical reference lines in the\nline chart as evidence.

To address this problem, we propose a framework of person\nretrieval based on cross-camera trajectory generation which integrates both\ntemporal and spatial information. To obtain the pedestrian trajectories, we\npropose a new cross-camera spatio-temporal model that integrates the walking\nhabits of pedestrians and the path layout between cameras, forming a joint\nprobability distribution. Such a spatio-temporal model among a camera network\ncan be specified using sparsely sampled pedestrian data. Based on the\nspatio-temporal model, the cross-camera trajectories of a specific pedestrian\ncan be extracted by the conditional random field model, and further optimized\nby the restricted nonnegative matrix factorization. Finally, a trajectory\nre-ranking technology is proposed to improve the person retrieval results. To\nverify the effectiveness of our approach, we build the first dataset of\ncross-camera pedestrian trajectories over an actual monitoring scenario, namely\nthe Person Trajectory Dataset.

Our ASV is equipped with a broadband marine radar, an Inertial\nNavigation System (INS), and uses official Electronic Navigational Charts\n(ENC). These sensors are used to provide situational awareness and, in series\nof well-defined steps, we can exclude land objects from the radar data, extract\ntracks associated with moving vessels within range of the radar, and then use a\nKalman Filter to track and predict the motion of other moving vessels in the\nvicinity.

This\nnew flexible-body immersed Lagrangian-Eulerian (ILE) approach incorporates the\ngeometrical and domain solution flexibility of the immersed boundary (IB)\nmethod with an accuracy comparable to body-fitted approaches that sharply\nresolve flows and stresses up to the fluid-structure interface. Unlike many IB\nmethods, our ILE formulation uses distinct momentum equations for the fluid and\nsolid subregions with a Dirichlet-Neumann coupling strategy that connects fluid\nand solid subproblems through simple interface conditions. We use a penalty\nmethod involving two representations of the fluid-structure interface. These\ntwo representations are connected by approximate Lagrange multiplier forces\nthat impose kinematic interface conditions. This approach also enables the use\nof multi-rate time stepping, which allows us to take different time step sizes\nfor the fluid and structure subproblems.

The major challenge in CIL is catastrophic\nforgetting, i.e., preserving as much of the old knowledge as possible while\nlearning new tasks. Various techniques, such as regularization, knowledge\ndistillation, and the use of exemplars, have been proposed to resolve this\nissue. However, prior works primarily focus on the incremental learning step,\nwhile ignoring the optimization during the base model training. We hypothesize\nthat a more transferable and generalizable feature representation from the base\nmodel would be beneficial to incremental learning.\nIn this work, we adopt multitask learning during base model training to\nimprove the feature generalizability. Specifically, instead of training a\nsingle model with all the base classes, we decompose the base classes into\nmultiple subsets and regard each of them as a task. These tasks are trained\nconcurrently and a shared feature extractor is obtained for incremental\nlearning. We evaluate our approach on two datasets under various\nconfigurations. The results show that our approach enhances the average\nincremental learning accuracy by up to 5.5%, which enables more reliable and\naccurate keyword spotting over time.

    "abstract": "When configuring a software product line, finding a good trade-off between\nmultiple orthogonal quality concerns is a challenging multi-objective\noptimisation problem. State-of-the-art solutions based on search-based\ntechniques create invalid configurations in intermediate steps, requiring\nadditional repair actions that reduce the efficiency of the search. In this\nwork, we introduce consistency-preserving configuration operators\n(CPCOs)--genetic operators that maintain valid configurations throughout the\nentire search. CPCOs bundle coherent sets of changes: the activation or\ndeactivation of a particular feature together with other (de)activations that\nare needed to preserve validity. In our evaluation, our instantiation of the\nIBEA algorithm with CPCOs outperforms two state-of-the-art tools for optimal\nproduct line configuration in terms of both speed and solution quality. The\nimprovements are especially pronounced in large product lines with thousands of\nfeatures.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning holds the key for solving complex tasks\nthat demand the coordination of learning agents. However, strong coordination\noften leads to expensive exploration over the exponentially large state-action\nspace. A powerful approach is to decompose team works into roles, which are\nideally assigned to agents with the relevant skills. Training agents to\nadaptively choose and play emerging roles in a team thus allows the team to\nscale to complex tasks and quickly adapt to changing environments. These\npromises, however, have not been fully realised by current role-based\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning methods as they assume either a pre-defined\nrole structure or a fixed team size. We propose a framework to learn role\nassignment and transfer across team sizes. In particular, we train a role\nassignment network for small teams by demonstration and transfer the network to\nlarger teams, which continue to learn through interaction with the environment.\nWe demonstrate that re-using the role-based credit assignment structure can\nfoster the learning process of larger reinforcement learning teams to achieve\ntasks requiring different roles.

In this work we study this problem in a more difficult scenario, in\nwhich no explicit annotation about the bias is available, and without any prior\nknowledge about its nature. We propose a fully unsupervised debiasing\nframework, consisting of three steps: first, we exploit the natural preference\nfor learning malignant biases, obtaining a bias-capturing model; then, we\nperform a pseudo-labelling step to obtain bias labels; finally we employ\nstate-of-the-art supervised debiasing techniques to obtain an unbiased model.\nWe also propose a theoretical framework to assess the biasness of a model, and\nprovide a detailed analysis on how biases affect the training of neural\nnetworks.

In this\nwork, we propose MAPLE-Edge, an edge device-oriented extension of MAPLE, the\nstate-of-the-art latency predictor for general purpose hardware, where we train\na regression network on architecture-latency pairs in conjunction with a\nhardware-runtime descriptor to effectively estimate latency on a diverse pool\nof edge devices.

We also demonstrate that unlike MAPLE which performs best when\ntrained on a pool of devices sharing a common runtime, MAPLE-Edge can\neffectively generalize across runtimes by applying a trick of normalizing\nperformance counters by the operator latency, in the measured hardware-runtime\ndescriptor.

We\nintroduce an extensible data-driven framework that leverages earth observations\nand frames agricultural land suitability as a geospatial impact assessment\nproblem, where the estimated effects of agricultural practices on\nagroecosystems serve as a land suitability score and guide decision making. We\nformulate this as a causal machine learning task and discuss how this approach\ncan be used for agricultural planning in a changing climate. Specifically, we\nextract the agricultural management practices of \"crop rotation\" and \"landscape\ncrop diversity\" from crop type maps, account for climate and land use data, and\nuse double machine learning to estimate their heterogeneous effect on Net\nPrimary Productivity (NPP), within the Flanders region of Belgium from 2010 to\n2020. We find that the effect of crop rotation was insignificant, while\nlandscape crop diversity had a small negative effect on NPP. Finally, we\nobserve considerable effect heterogeneity in space for both practices and\nanalyze it.",

    "title": "Blending Data and Physics Against False Data Injection Attack: An  Event-Triggered Moving Target Defence Approach",
    "abstract": "Recently, data-driven detectors and physics-based Moving Target Defences\n(MTD) have been proposed to detect false data injection (FDI) attacks on power\nsystem state estimation. However, the uncontrollable false positive rate of the\ndata-driven detector and the extra cost of frequent MTD usage limit their wide\napplications. Few works have explored the overlap between these two areas to\ncollaboratively detect FDI attacks. To fill the gap, this paper proposes\nblending data-driven and physics-based approaches to enhance the detection of\nFDI attacks. To start, a physics-informed data-driven attack detection and\nidentification algorithm is proposed. Following this, an MTD protocol is\ntriggered by a positive signal from the data-driven detector and is formulated\nas a bilevel optimisation to robustly guarantee the effectiveness of MTD\nagainst the worst-case attack around the identified attack vector while\nmaximising the hiddenness of MTD. To guarantee the feasibility and convergence,\nthe bilevel nonconvex optimisation is separated into two stages, and for each\nstage, a semidefinite programming is derived through duality and linear matrix\ninequality. The simulation results verify that by blending data and physics, it\ncan significantly enhance the detection performance while simultaneously\nreducing the false positive rate of the data-driven detector and the usage of\nMTD.",

While this observation is widespread in the sociolinguistic\nliterature, it has not been consistently reproduced in computer simulations\nwith neural agents. In this paper, we thus aim to clarify this apparent\ncontradiction. We explore emergent language properties by varying agent\npopulation size in the speaker-listener Lewis Game. After reproducing the\nexperimental difference, we challenge the simulation assumption that the agent\ncommunity is homogeneous. We first investigate how speaker-listener asymmetry\nalters language structure to examine two potential diversity factors: training\nspeed and network capacity. We find out that emergent language properties are\nonly altered by the relative difference of learning speeds between speaker and\nlistener, and not by their absolute values. From then, we leverage this\nobservation to control population heterogeneity without introducing confounding\nfactors. We finally show that introducing such training speed heterogeneities\nnaturally sort out the initial contradiction: larger simulated communities\nstart developing more stable and structured languages.",

    "abstract": "Video retrieval using natural language queries has attracted increasing\ninterest due to its relevance in real-world applications, from intelligent\naccess in private media galleries to web-scale video search. Learning the\ncross-similarity of video and text in a joint embedding space is the dominant\napproach. To do so, a contrastive loss is usually employed because it organizes\nthe embedding space by putting similar items close and dissimilar items far.\nThis framework leads to competitive recall rates, as they solely focus on the\nrank of the groundtruth items. Yet, assessing the quality of the ranking list\nis of utmost importance when considering intelligent retrieval systems, since\nmultiple items may share similar semantics, hence a high relevance. Moreover,\nthe aforementioned framework uses a fixed margin to separate similar and\ndissimilar items, treating all non-groundtruth items as equally irrelevant. In\nthis paper we propose to use a variable margin: we argue that varying the\nmargin used during training based on how much relevant an item is to a given\nquery, i.e. a relevance-based margin, easily improves the quality of the\nranking lists measured through nDCG and mAP. We demonstrate the advantages of\nour technique using different models on EPIC-Kitchens-100 and YouCook2. We show\nthat even if we carefully tuned the fixed margin, our technique (which does not\nhave the margin as a hyper-parameter) would still achieve better performance.\nFinally, extensive ablation studies and qualitative analysis support the\nrobustness of our approach.

    "abstract": "Object detection has attracted great attention in the computer vision area\nand has emerged as an indispensable component in many vision systems. In the\nera of deep learning, many high-performance object detection networks have been\nproposed. Although these detection networks show high performance, they are\nvulnerable to adversarial patch attacks. Changing the pixels in a restricted\nregion can easily fool the detection network in the physical world. In\nparticular, person-hiding attacks are emerging as a serious problem in many\nsafety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and surveillance\nsystems. Although it is necessary to defend against an adversarial patch\nattack, very few efforts have been dedicated to defending against person-hiding\nattacks. To tackle the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel defense\nstrategy that mitigates a person-hiding attack by optimizing defense patterns,\nwhile previous methods optimize the model. In the proposed method, a\nframe-shaped pattern called a 'universal white frame' (UWF) is optimized and\nplaced on the outside of the image. To defend against adversarial patch\nattacks, UWF should have three properties (i) suppressing the effect of the\nadversarial patch, (ii) maintaining its original prediction, and (iii)\napplicable regardless of images. To satisfy the aforementioned properties, we\npropose a novel pattern optimization algorithm that can defend against the\nadversarial patch. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that the\nproposed method effectively defends against the adversarial patch attack.",

    "abstract": "Quipper and Proto-Quipper are a family of quantum programming languages that,\nby their nature as circuit description languages, involve two runtimes: one at\nwhich the program generates a circuit and one at which the circuit is executed,\nnormally with probabilistic results due to measurements. Accordingly, the\nlanguage distinguishes two kinds of data: parameters, which are known at\ncircuit generation time, and states, which are known at circuit execution time.\nSometimes, it is desirable for the results of measurements to control the\ngeneration of the next part of the circuit. Therefore, the language needs to\nturn states, such as measurement outcomes, into parameters, an operation we\ncall dynamic lifting. The goal of this paper is to model this interaction\nbetween the runtimes by providing a general categorical structure enriched in\nwhat we call \"bisets\". We demonstrate that the biset-enriched structure\nachieves a proper semantics of the two runtimes and their interaction, by\nshowing that it models a variant of Proto-Quipper with dynamic lifting.

In this paper, we extend Proto-Quipper-M with a construct called\ndynamic lifting, which is present in Quipper. By virtue of being a circuit\ndescription language, Proto-Quipper has two separate runtimes: circuit\ngeneration time and circuit execution time. Values that are known at circuit\ngeneration time are called parameters, and values that are known at circuit\nexecution time are called states. Dynamic lifting is an operation that enables\na state, such as the result of a measurement, to be lifted to a parameter,\nwhere it can influence the generation of the next portion of the circuit. As a\nresult, dynamic lifting enables Proto-Quipper programs to interleave classical\nand quantum computation. We describe the syntax of a language we call\nProto-Quipper-Dyn. Its type system uses a system of modalities to keep track of\nthe use of dynamic lifting. We also provide an operational semantics, as well\nas an abstract categorical semantics for dynamic lifting based on enriched\ncategory theory. We prove that both the type system and the operational\nsemantics are sound with respect to our categorical semantics.

    "abstract": "Conversational systems or chatbots are an example of AI-Infused Applications\n(AIIA). Chatbots are especially important as they are often the first\ninteraction of clients with a business and are the entry point of a business\ninto the AI (Artificial Intelligence) world. The quality of the chatbot is,\ntherefore, key. However, as is the case in general with AIIAs, it is especially\nchallenging to assess and control the quality of chatbot systems. Beyond the\ninherent statistical nature of these systems, where occasional failure is\nacceptable, we identify two major challenges. The first is to release an\ninitial system that is of sufficient quality such that humans will interact\nwith it. The second is to maintain the quality, enhance its capabilities,\nimprove it and make necessary adjustments based on changing user requests or\ndrift. These challenges exist because it is impossible to predict the real\ndistribution of user requests and the natural language they will use to express\nthese requests. Moreover, any empirical distribution of requests is likely to\nchange over time. This may be due to periodicity, changing usage, and drift of\ntopics.\nWe provide a methodology and set of technologies to address these challenges\nand to provide automated assistance through a human-in-the-loop approach. We\nnotice that it is crucial to connect between the different phases in the\nlifecycle of the chatbot development and to make sure it provides its expected\nbusiness value. For example, that it frees human agents to deal with tasks\nother than answering human users. Our methodology and technologies apply during\nchatbot training in the pre-production phase, through to chatbot usage in the\nfield in the post-production phase.

    "abstract": "Most research into anti-phishing defence assumes that the mal-actor is\nattempting to harvest end-users' personally identifiable information or login\ncredentials and, hence, focuses on detecting phishing websites. The defences\nfor this type of attack are usually activated after the end-user clicks on a\nlink, at which point the link is checked. This is known as after-the-click\ndetection. However, more sophisticated phishing attacks (such as spear-phishing\nand whaling) are rarely designed to get the end-user to visit a website.\nInstead, they attempt to get the end-user to perform some other action, for\nexample, transferring money from their bank account to the mal-actors account.\nThese attacks are rarer, and before-the-click defence has been investigated\nless than after-the-click defence. To better integrate and contextualize these\nstudies in the overall anti-phishing research, this paper presents a systematic\nliterature review of proposed anti-phishing defences. From a total of 6330\npapers, 21 primary studies and 335 secondary studies were identified and\nexamined. The current research was grouped into six primary categories,\nblocklist/allowlist, heuristics, content, visual, artificial\nintelligence/machine learning and proactive, with an additional category of\n\"other\" for detection techniques that do not fit into any of the primary\ncategories. It then discusses the performance and suitability of using these\ntechniques for detecting phishing emails before the end-user even reads the\nemail. Finally, it suggests some promising areas for further research.",

In this work, we propose a novel \\emph{uniform\nframework} for diagnosability of DES subject to, not only sensor failures, but\nalso a very general class of unreliable sensors. Our approach is to use linear\ntemporal logic (LTL) with semantics on infinite traces to describe the possible\nbehaviors of the sensors. A new notion of $\\varphi$-diagnosability is proposed\nas the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a diagnoser when\nthe behaviors of sensors satisfy the LTL formula $\\varphi$. Effective approach\nis provided to verify this notion. We show that, our new notion of\n$\\varphi$-diagnosability subsumes all existing notions of robust diagnosability\nof DES subject to sensor failures. Furthermore, the proposed framework is\nuser-friendly and flexible since it supports an arbitrary user-defined\nunreliable sensor type based on the specific scenario of the application. As\nexamples, we provide two new notions of diagnosability, which have never been\ninvestigated in the literature, using our uniform framework.",

    "abstract": "Humans have a remarkably large capacity to store detailed visual information\nin long-term memory even after a single exposure, as demonstrated by classic\nexperiments in psychology. For example, Standing (1973) showed that humans\ncould recognize with high accuracy thousands of pictures that they had seen\nonly once a few days prior to a recognition test. In deep learning, the primary\nmode of incorporating new information into a model is through gradient descent\nin the model's parameter space. This paper asks whether deep learning via\ngradient descent can match the efficiency of human visual long-term memory to\nincorporate new information in a rigorous, head-to-head, quantitative\ncomparison. We answer this in the negative: even in the best case, models\nlearning via gradient descent appear to require approximately 10 exposures to\nthe same visual materials in order to reach a recognition memory performance\nhumans achieve after only a single exposure. Prior knowledge induced via\npretraining and bigger model sizes improve performance, but these improvements\nare not very visible after a single exposure (it takes a few exposures for the\nimprovements to become apparent), suggesting that simply scaling up the\npretraining data size or model size might not be enough for the model to reach\nhuman-level memory efficiency.",

However, sets of subspaces with special pattern of intersections with\nother subspaces have been already studied, such as spreads, generalised arcs\nand caps, and Cameron-Liebler sets. In this paper we provide bounds involving\nthe dimension of the subspaces forming a subspace design and the parameters of\nthe ambient space, showing constructions satisfying the equality in such\nbounds. Then we also introduce two dualities relations among them. Among\nsubspace designs, those that we call s-designs are central in this paper, as\nthey generalize the notion of s-scattered subspace to subspace design and for\ntheir special properties. Indeed, we prove that, for certain values of s, they\ncorrespond to the optimal subspace designs, that is those subspace designs that\nare associated with linear maximum sum-rank metric codes. Special attention has\nbeen paid for the case s=1 for which we provide several examples, yielding\nsurprising to families of two-intersection sets with respect to hyperplanes\n(and hence two-weight linear codes). Moreover, s-designs can be used to\nconstruct explicit lossless dimension expanders (a linear-algebraic analogue of\nexpander graphs), without any restriction on the order of the field. Another\nclass of subspace designs we study is those of cutting designs, since they\nextend the notion of cutting blocking set recently introduced by Bonini and\nBorello.

Our approach is three-fold: First, generated\nchains of reasoning show how answers are implied by the system's own internal\nbeliefs. Second, users can interact with the explanations to identify erroneous\nmodel beliefs and provide corrections. Third, we augment the model with a\ndynamic memory of such corrections. Retrievals from memory are used as\nadditional context for QA, to help avoid previous mistakes in similar new\nsituations - a novel type of memory-based continuous learning. To our\nknowledge, this is the first system to generate chains that are both faithful\n(the answer follows from the reasoning) and truthful (the chain reflects the\nsystem's own beliefs, as ascertained by self-querying). In evaluation, users\njudge that a majority (65%+) of generated chains clearly show how an answer\nfollows from a set of facts - substantially better than a high-performance\nbaseline.

Following the seminal paper\nof Foster and Vohra (1998), nature is often modeled as an adaptive adversary\nwho sees all activity of the forecaster except the randomization that the\nforecaster may deploy. A number of papers have proposed randomized forecasting\nstrategies that achieve an $\\epsilon$-calibration error rate of\n$O(1/\\sqrt{T})$, which we prove is tight in general. On the other hand, it is\nwell known that it is not possible to be calibrated without randomization, or\nif nature also sees the forecaster's randomization; in both cases the\ncalibration error could be $\\Omega(1)$. Inspired by the equally seminal works\non the \"power of two choices\" and imprecise probability theory, we study a\nsmall variant of the standard online calibration problem. The adversary gives\nthe forecaster the option of making two nearby probabilistic forecasts, or\nequivalently an interval forecast of small width, and the endpoint closest to\nthe revealed outcome is used to judge calibration. This power of two choices,\nor imprecise forecast, accords the forecaster with significant power -- we show\nthat a faster $\\epsilon$-calibration rate of $O(1/T)$ can be achieved even\nwithout deploying any randomization.",

    "abstract": "This research aims to study a self-supervised 3D clothing reconstruction\nmethod, which recovers the geometry shape, and texture of human clothing from a\nsingle 2D image. Compared with existing methods, we observe that three primary\nchallenges remain: (1) the conventional template-based methods are limited to\nmodeling non-rigid clothing objects, e.g., handbags and dresses, which are\ncommon in fashion images; (2) 3D ground-truth meshes of clothing are usually\ninaccessible due to annotation difficulties and time costs. (3) It remains\nchallenging to simultaneously optimize four reconstruction factors, i.e.,\ncamera viewpoint, shape, texture, and illumination. The inherent ambiguity\ncompromises the model training, such as the dilemma between a large shape with\na remote camera or a small shape with a close camera.\nIn an attempt to address the above limitations, we propose a causality-aware\nself-supervised learning method to adaptively reconstruct 3D non-rigid objects\nfrom 2D images without 3D annotations. In particular, to solve the inherent\nambiguity among four implicit variables, i.e., camera position, shape, texture,\nand illumination, we study existing works and introduce an explainable\nstructural causal map (SCM) to build our model. The proposed model structure\nfollows the spirit of the causal map, which explicitly considers the prior\ntemplate in the camera estimation and shape prediction. When optimization, the\ncausality intervention tool, i.e., two expectation-maximization loops, is\ndeeply embedded in our algorithm to (1) disentangle four encoders and (2) help\nthe prior template update. Extensive experiments on two 2D fashion benchmarks,\ne.g., ATR, and Market-HQ, show that the proposed method could yield\nhigh-fidelity 3D reconstruction.

While\nface swapping has drawn much attention, the task of head swapping has rarely\nbeen explored, particularly under the few-shot setting.

Secondly, to tackle the challenges of skin color variations and\nhead-background mismatches in the swapping procedure, a Head2Scene Blender is\nintroduced to simultaneously modify facial skin color and fill mismatched gaps\nin the background around the head.

    "abstract": "Progress in self-supervised learning has brought strong general image\nrepresentation learning methods. Yet so far, it has mostly focused on\nimage-level learning. In turn, tasks such as unsupervised image segmentation\nhave not benefited from this trend as they require spatially-diverse\nrepresentations. However, learning dense representations is challenging, as in\nthe unsupervised context it is not clear how to guide the model to learn\nrepresentations that correspond to various potential object categories. In this\npaper, we argue that self-supervised learning of object parts is a solution to\nthis issue. Object parts are generalizable: they are a priori independent of an\nobject definition, but can be grouped to form objects a posteriori. To this\nend, we leverage the recently proposed Vision Transformer's capability of\nattending to objects and combine it with a spatially dense clustering task for\nfine-tuning the spatial tokens. Our method surpasses the state-of-the-art on\nthree semantic segmentation benchmarks by 17%-3%, showing that our\nrepresentations are versatile under various object definitions. Finally, we\nextend this to fully unsupervised segmentation - which refrains completely from\nusing label information even at test-time - and demonstrate that a simple\nmethod for automatically merging discovered object parts based on community\ndetection yields substantial gains.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently exploded in popularity thanks to\ntheir broad applicability to graph-related problems such as quantum chemistry,\ndrug discovery, and high energy physics. However, meeting demand for novel GNN\nmodels and fast inference simultaneously is challenging because of the gap\nbetween developing efficient accelerators and the rapid creation of new GNN\nmodels. Prior art focuses on the acceleration of specific classes of GNNs, such\nas Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), but lacks the generality to support a\nwide range of existing or new GNN models. Meanwhile, most work rely on graph\npre-processing to exploit data locality, making them unsuitable for real-time\napplications. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a generic\ndataflow architecture for GNN acceleration, named FlowGNN, which can flexibly\nsupport the majority of message-passing GNNs. The contributions are three-fold.\nFirst, we propose a novel and scalable dataflow architecture, which flexibly\nsupports a wide range of GNN models with message-passing mechanism. The\narchitecture features a configurable dataflow optimized for simultaneous\ncomputation of node embedding, edge embedding, and message passing, which is\ngenerally applicable to all models. We also propose a rich library of\nmodel-specific components. Second, we deliver ultra-fast real-time GNN\ninference without any graph pre-processing, making it agnostic to dynamically\nchanging graph structures. Third, we verify our architecture on the Xilinx\nAlveo U50 FPGA board and measure the on-board end-to-end performance. We\nachieve a speed-up of up to 51-254x against CPU (6226R) and 1.3-477x against\nGPU (A6000) (with batch sizes 1 through 1024); we also outperform the SOTA GNN\naccelerator I-GCN by 1.03x and 1.25x across two datasets.

We consider a performance criterion which\ninvolves the trace of an analytic function of the spectral density of the\noutput process. This class of \"covariance-analytic\" cost functionals includes\nthe usual mean square and risk-sensitive criteria as particular cases. Due to\nthe presence of the \"cost-shaping\" analytic function, the performance criterion\nis related to higher-order Hardy-Schatten norms of the system transfer\nfunction.

Network inputs were digitally\nreconstructed radiography, gross tumor volume(GTV), and nodal GTV. A physician\nscored each aperture for 20 patients on a 5-point scale(>3 acceptable). A\nplanning algorithm was then developed to create a homogeneous dose using a\ncombination of wedges and subfields.

    "abstract": "In pathology, tissue samples are assessed using multiple staining techniques\nto enhance contrast in unique histologic features. In this paper, we introduce\na multimodal CNN-GNN based graph fusion approach that leverages complementary\ninformation from multiple non-registered histopathology images to predict\npathologic scores. We demonstrate this approach in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis\n(NASH) by predicting CRN fibrosis stage and NAFLD Activity Score (NAS). Primary\nassessment of NASH typically requires liver biopsy evaluation on two\nhistological stains: Trichrome (TC) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Our\nmultimodal approach learns to extract complementary information from TC and H&E\ngraphs corresponding to each stain while simultaneously learning an optimal\npolicy to combine this information. We report up to 20% improvement in\npredicting fibrosis stage and NAS component grades over single-stain modeling\napproaches, measured by computing linearly weighted Cohen's kappa between\nmachine-derived vs. pathologist consensus scores. Broadly, this paper\ndemonstrates the value of leveraging diverse pathology images for improved\nML-powered histologic assessment.",

One efficient\nCSI feedback method is the Auto-Encoder (AE) structure based on deep learning,\nyet facing problems in actual deployments, such as selecting the deployment\nmode when deploying in a cell with multiple complex scenarios. Rather than\ndesigning an AE network with huge complexity to deal with CSI of all scenarios,\na more realistic mode is to divide the CSI dataset by region/scenario and use\nmultiple relatively simple AE networks to handle subregions' CSI. However, both\nrequire high memory capacity for user equipment (UE) and are not suitable for\nlow-level devices. In this paper, we propose a new user-friendly-designed\nframework based on the latter multi-tasking mode. Via Multi-Task Learning, our\nframework, Single-encoder-to-Multiple-decoders (S-to-M), designs the multiple\nindependent AEs into a joint architecture: a shared encoder corresponds to\nmultiple task-specific decoders. We also complete our framework with GateNet as\na classifier to enable the base station autonomously select the right\ntask-specific decoder corresponding to the subregion. Experiments on the\nsimulating multi-scenario CSI dataset demonstrate our proposed S-to-M's\nadvantages over the other benchmark modes, i.e., significantly reducing the\nmodel complexity and the UE's memory consumption",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are cryptographic protocols that are enforced without a\njudiciary. Smart contracts are used occasionally in Bitcoin and are prevalent\nin Ethereum. Public quantum money improves upon cash we use today, yet the\ncurrent constructions do not enable smart contracts. In this work, we define\nand introduce quantum payment schemes, and show how to implement prudent\ncontracts -- a non-trivial subset of the functionality that a network such as\nEthereum provides. Examples discussed include: multi-signature wallets in which\nfunds can be spent by any 2-out-of-3 owners; restricted accounts that can send\nfunds only to designated destinations; and \"colored coins\" that can represent\nstocks that can be freely traded, and their owner would receive dividends. Our\napproach is not as universal as the one used in Ethereum since we do not reach\na consensus regarding the state of a ledger. We call our proposal prudent\ncontracts to reflect this. The main building block is either quantum tokens for\ndigital signatures (Ben-David and Sattath QCrypt'17, Coladangelo et al.\nCrypto'21), semi-quantum tokens for digital signatures (Shmueli'22) or one-shot\nsignatures (Amos et al. STOC'20). The solution has all the benefits of public\nquantum money: no mining is necessary, and the security model is standard\n(e.g., it is not susceptible to 51\\% attacks, as in Bitcoin). Our one-shot\nsignature construction can be used to upgrade the Bitcoin network to a quantum\npayment scheme. Notable advantages of this approach are: transactions are\nlocally verifiable and without latency, the throughput is unbounded, and most\nimportantly, it would remove the need for Bitcoin mining.

    "abstract": "The article is concerned with the problem of multi-step financial time series\nforecasting of Foreign Exchange (FX) rates. To address this problem, we\nintroduce a parameter-free regression network termed RegPred Net. The exchange\nrate to forecast is treated as a stochastic process. It is assumed to follow a\ngeneralization of Brownian motion and the mean-reverting process referred to as\nthe generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, with time-dependent\ncoefficients. Using past observed values of the input time series, these\ncoefficients can be regressed online by the cells of the first half of the\nnetwork (Reg). The regressed coefficients depend only on - but are very\nsensitive to - a small number of hyperparameters required to be set by a global\noptimization procedure for which, Bayesian optimization is an adequate\nheuristic. Thanks to its multi-layered architecture, the second half of the\nregression network (Pred) can project time-dependent values for the OU process\ncoefficients and generate realistic trajectories of the time series.\nPredictions can be easily derived in the form of expected values estimated by\naveraging values obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. The forecasting accuracy\non a 100 days horizon is evaluated for several of the most important FX rates\nsuch as EUR/USD, EUR/CNY, and EUR/GBP. Our experimental results show that the\nRegPred Net significantly outperforms ARMA, ARIMA, LSTMs, and Autoencoder-LSTM\nmodels in this task.",

    "abstract": "As the pump-and-dump schemes (P&Ds) proliferate in the cryptocurrency market,\nit becomes imperative to detect such fraudulent activities in advance, to\ninform potentially susceptible investors before they become victims. In this\npaper, we focus on the target coin prediction task, i.e., to predict the pump\nprobability of all coins listed in the target exchange before a pump. We\nconduct a comprehensive study of the latest P&Ds, investigate 709 events\norganized in Telegram channels from Jan. 2019 to Jan. 2022, and unearth some\nabnormal yet interesting patterns of P&Ds. Empirical analysis demonstrates that\npumped coins exhibit intra-channel homogeneity and inter-channel heterogeneity,\nwhich inspires us to develop a novel sequence-based neural network named SNN.\nSpecifically, SNN encodes each channel's pump history as a sequence\nrepresentation via a positional attention mechanism, which filters useful\ninformation and alleviates the noise introduced when the sequence length is\nlong. We also identify and address the coin-side cold-start problem in a\npractical setting. Extensive experiments show a lift of 1.6% AUC and 41.0% Hit\nRatio@3 brought by our method, making it well-suited for real-world\napplication.

    "abstract": "Statistical Inference is the process of determining a probability\ndistribution over the space of parameters of a model given a data set. As more\ndata becomes available this probability distribution becomes updated via the\napplication of Bayes' theorem. We present a treatment of this Bayesian updating\nprocess as a continuous dynamical system. Statistical inference is then\ngoverned by a first order differential equation describing a trajectory or flow\nin the information geometry determined by a parametric family of models. We\nsolve this equation for some simple models and show that when the\nCram\\'{e}r-Rao bound is saturated the learning rate is governed by a simple\n$1/T$ power-law, with $T$ a time-like variable denoting the quantity of data.\nThe presence of hidden variables can be incorporated in this setting, leading\nto an additional driving term in the resulting flow equation. We illustrate\nthis with both analytic and numerical examples based on Gaussians and Gaussian\nRandom Processes and inference of the coupling constant in the 1D Ising model.\nFinally we compare the qualitative behaviour exhibited by Bayesian flows to the\ntraining of various neural networks on benchmarked data sets such as MNIST and\nCIFAR10 and show how that for networks exhibiting small final losses the simple\npower-law is also satisfied.",

It provides a\npowerful framework to model expert's behavior, and a data-driven way to design\nan objective function so that the induced optimal control is adapted to a\ncontextual environment. In this paper, we design an IOC algorithm for\nlinear-quadratic tracking problems with random time horizon, and prove the\nstatistical consistency of the algorithm. More specifically, the proposed\nestimator is the solution to a convex optimization problem, which means that\nthe estimator does not suffer from local minima. This enables the proven\nstatistical consistency to actually be achieved in practice. The algorithm is\nalso verified on simulated data as well as data from a real world experiment,\nboth in the setting of identifying the objective function of human tracking\nlocomotion. The statistical consistency is illustrated on the synthetic data\nset, and the experimental results on the real data shows that we can get a good\nprediction on human tracking locomotion based on estimating the objective\nfunction. It shows that the theory and the model have a good performance in\nreal practice.

As the dimension of state or parameter space grows, performing the full\nKalman update with the dense covariance matrix for a large scale system\nrequires increased storage and computational complexity, making it impractical.\nThe VIF approach, based on mean-field Gaussian variational inference, reduces\nthis burden through the variational approximation to the covariance usually in\nthe form of a diagonal covariance approximation. The challenge is to retain\nconvergence and correct for biases introduced by the sequential VIF steps. We\ndesire a framework that improves feasibility while still maintaining reasonable\nproximity to the optimal Kalman filter as data is assimilated. To accomplish\nthis goal, a Hinf-norm based optimization perturbs the VIF covariance matrix to\nimprove robustness. This yields a novel VIF- Hinf recursion that employs\nconsecutive variational inference and Hinf based optimization steps. We explore\nthe development of this method and investigate a numerical example to\nillustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter.",

Using particle-mesh $N$-body\nsimulations that consistently solve the dark energy evolution on a grid, we\nfind that the next-to-leading order in the EFT expansion, which comprises the\nterms of the equations of motion that are quadratic in the field variables,\ngives rise to a new instability in the regime of low speed of sound (high Mach\nnumber). We rule out the possibility of a numerical artefact by considering\nsimplified cases in spherically and plane symmetric situations analytically. If\nthe speed of sound vanishes exactly, the non-linear instability makes the\nevolution singular in finite time, signalling a breakdown of the EFT framework.\nThe case of finite (but small) speed of sound is subtle, and the local\nsingularity could be replaced by some other type of behaviour with strong\nnon-linearities. While an ultraviolet completion may cure the problem in\nprinciple, there is no reason why this should be the case in general.
