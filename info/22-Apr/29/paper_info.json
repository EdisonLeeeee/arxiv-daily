    "abstract": "Worst-case dynamic PDN noise analysis is an essential step in PDN sign-off to\nensure the performance and reliability of chips. However, with the growing PDN\nsize and increasing scenarios to be validated, it becomes very time- and\nresource-consuming to conduct full-stack PDN simulation to check the worst-case\nnoise for different test vectors. Recently, various works have proposed machine\nlearning based methods for supply noise prediction, many of which still suffer\nfrom large training overhead, inefficiency, or non-scalability. Thus, this\npaper proposed an efficient and scalable framework for the worst-case dynamic\nPDN noise prediction. The framework first reduces the spatial and temporal\nredundancy in the PDN and input current vector, and then employs efficient\nfeature extraction as well as a novel convolutional neural network architecture\nto predict the worst-case dynamic PDN noise. Experimental results show that the\nproposed framework consistently outperforms the commercial tool and the\nstate-of-the-art machine learning method with only 0.63-1.02% mean relative\nerror and 25-69$\\times$ speedup.",

This paper introduces a more general problem, called\nMachine Learning based Early Decision Making (ML-EDM), which consists in\noptimizing the decision times of models in a wide range of settings where data\nis collected over time.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to adapt a model trained on the\nsource domain (e.g. synthetic data) to the target domain (e.g. real-world data)\nwithout requiring further annotations on the target domain. This work focuses\non UDA for semantic segmentation as real-world pixel-wise annotations are\nparticularly expensive to acquire. As UDA methods for semantic segmentation are\nusually GPU memory intensive, most previous methods operate only on downscaled\nimages. We question this design as low-resolution predictions often fail to\npreserve fine details. The alternative of training with random crops of\nhigh-resolution images alleviates this problem but falls short in capturing\nlong-range, domain-robust context information. Therefore, we propose HRDA, a\nmulti-resolution training approach for UDA, that combines the strengths of\nsmall high-resolution crops to preserve fine segmentation details and large\nlow-resolution crops to capture long-range context dependencies with a learned\nscale attention, while maintaining a manageable GPU memory footprint. HRDA\nenables adapting small objects and preserving fine segmentation details. It\nsignificantly improves the state-of-the-art performance by 5.5 mIoU for\nGTA-to-Cityscapes and 4.9 mIoU for Synthia-to-Cityscapes, resulting in\nunprecedented 73.8 and 65.8 mIoU, respectively.

The ARRIVAL problem,\nas defined by Dohrau and al., consists in determining which sink will be\nreached. While the walk itself can take an exponential number of steps, this\nproblem belongs to the complexity class NP$\\cap$co-NP without being known to be\nin P. Several variants have been studied where we add one or two players to the\nmodel, defining deterministic analogs of stochastic models (e.g., Markovian\ndecision processes, Stochastic Games) with rotor-routing rules instead of\nrandom transitions. The corresponding decision problem address the existence of\nstrategies for players that ensure some condition on the reached sink. These\nproblems are known to be $NP$-complete for one player and $PSPACE$-complete for\ntwo players. In this work, we define a class of directed graphs, namely\ntree-like multigraphs, which are multigraphs having the global shape of an\nundirected tree. We prove that the different variants of the reachability\nproblem with zero, one, or two players can be solved in linear time, while the\nnumber of steps of rotor walks can still be exponential.

    "abstract": "Compared to their biological counterparts, aerial robots demonstrate limited\ncapabilities when tasked to interact in unstructured environments. Very often,\nthe limitation lies in their inability to tolerate collisions and to\nsuccessfully land, or perch, on objects of unknown shape. Over the past years,\nefforts to address this have introduced designs that incorporate mechanical\nimpact protection and grasping/perching structures at the cost of reduced\nagility and flight time due to added weight and bulkiness. In this work, we\ndevelop a fabric-based, soft-bodied aerial robot (SoBAR) composed of both\ncontact-reactive perching and embodied impact protection structures while\nremaining lightweight and streamlined. The robot is capable to 1) pneumatically\nvary its body stiffness for collision resilience and 2) utilize a hybrid\nfabric-based, bistable (HFB) grasper to perform passive grasping. When compared\nto conventional rigid drone frames the SoBAR successfully demonstrates its\nability to dissipate impact from head-on collisions and maintain flight\nstability without any structural damage. Furthermore, in dynamic perching\nscenarios the HFB grasper is capable to convert impact energy upon contact into\nfirm grasp through rapid body shape conforming in less than 4ms. We\nexhaustively study and offer insights for this novel perching scheme through\ngrasping characterization, grasp wrench analysis, and experimental grasping\nvalidations in objects with various shapes. Finally, we demonstrate the\ncomplete control pipeline for SoBAR to approach an object, dynamically perch on\nit, recover from it, and land.",

However, manually\ndesigning a good loss is a big challenge due to the complexity of the problem.\nA large fraction of previous work focuses on handcrafted loss functions, which\nneeds significant expertise and human effort. In this paper, inspired by the\nrecent development of automated machine learning, we propose an automatic loss\nfunction generation framework, AutoLossGen, which is able to generate loss\nfunctions directly constructed from basic mathematical operators without prior\nknowledge on loss structure. More specifically, we develop a controller model\ndriven by reinforcement learning to generate loss functions, and develop\niterative and alternating optimization schedule to update the parameters of\nboth the controller model and the recommender model. One challenge for\nautomatic loss generation in recommender systems is the extreme sparsity of\nrecommendation datasets, which leads to the sparse reward problem for loss\ngeneration and search. To solve the problem, we further develop a reward\nfiltering mechanism for efficient and effective loss generation. Experimental\nresults show that our framework manages to create tailored loss functions for\ndifferent recommendation models and datasets, and the generated loss gives\nbetter recommendation performance than commonly used baseline losses. Besides,\nmost of the generated losses are transferable, i.e., the loss generated based\non one model and dataset also works well for another model or dataset.

We\npresent a comprehensive theoretical analysis of FedShuffle and show that both\ntheoretically and empirically, our approach does not suffer from the objective\nfunction mismatch that is present in FL methods which assume homogeneous\nupdates in heterogeneous FL setups, e.g., FedAvg (McMahan et al., 2017). In\naddition, by combining the ingredients above, FedShuffle improves upon FedNova\n(Wang et al., 2020), which was previously proposed to solve this mismatch. We\nalso show that FedShuffle with momentum variance reduction can improve upon\nnon-local methods under a Hessian similarity assumption. Finally, through\nexperiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we illustrate how each of the\nfour ingredients used in FedShuffle helps improve the use of local updates in\nFL.",

    "title": "Minimizing Client Drift in Federated Learning via Adaptive Bias  Estimation",
    "abstract": "In Federated Learning a number of clients collaborate to train a model\nwithout sharing their data. Client models are optimized locally and are\ncommunicated through a central hub called server. A major challenge is to deal\nwith heterogeneity among clients' data which causes the local optimization to\ndrift away with respect to the global objective. In order to estimate and\ntherefore remove this drift, variance reduction techniques have been\nincorporated into Federated Learning optimization recently. However, the\nexisting solutions propagate the error of their estimations, throughout the\noptimization trajectory which leads to inaccurate approximations of the\nclients' drift and ultimately failure to remove them properly. In this paper,\nwe address this issue by introducing an adaptive algorithm that efficiently\nreduces clients' drift. Compared to the previous works on adapting variance\nreduction to Federated Learning, our approach uses less or the same level of\ncommunication bandwidth, computation or memory. Additionally, it addresses the\ninstability problem--prevalent in prior work, caused by increasing norm of the\nestimates which makes our approach a much more practical solution for large\nscale Federated Learning settings. Our experimental results demonstrate that\nthe proposed algorithm converges significantly faster and achieves higher\naccuracy compared to the baselines in an extensive set of Federated Learning\nbenchmarks.",

Existing malicious URL detection techniques\nare limited and to handle unseen features as well as generalize to test data.\nIn this study, we extract a novel set of lexical and web-scrapped features and\nemploy machine learning technique to set up system for fraudulent advertisement\nURLs detection. The combination set of six different kinds of features\nprecisely overcome the obfuscation in fraudulent URL classification.

For this framework, we analyze\nthe performance of four machine learning techniques: Random Forest, Gradient\nBoost, XGBoost and AdaBoost in the detection part. With our proposed method, we\ncan achieve a false negative rate as low as 0.0037 while maintaining high\naccuracy of 99.63%.

    "abstract": "In this article, we present reduced-order modeling for Koopman operators of\nnonautonomous dynamic systems in multiscale media. Koopman operators can\ntransform the nonlinear dynamic systems into linear systems through acting on\nobservation function spaces. Different from the case of autonomous dynamic\nsystems, the Koopman operator family of nonautonomous dynamic systems\nsignificantly depend on a time pair. In order to effectively estimate the\ntime-dependent Koopman operators, a moving time window is used to decompose the\nsnapshot data, and the extended dynamic mode decomposition method is applied to\ncomputing the Koopman operators in each local temporal domain. To accurately\nconstruct the models of dynamic systems in multiscale media, we may use high\nspatial dimension of observation data. It is challenging to compute the Koopman\noperators using the high dimensional data. Thus, the strategy of reduced-order\nmodeling is proposed to treat the difficulty. The proposed reduced-order\nmodeling includes two stages: offline stage and online stage. In offline stage,\na block-wise low rank decomposition is used to reduce the spatial dimension of\ninitial snapshot data. For the nonautonomous dynamic systems, real-time\nobservation data may be required to update the Koopman operators. An online\nreduced-order modeling is proposed to correct the offline reduced-order\nmodeling.Three methods are developed for the online reduced-order modeling:\nfully online, semi-online and adaptive online. The adaptive online method\nautomatically selects the fully online or semi-online and can achieve a good\ntrade-off between modeling accuracy and efficiency. A few numerical examples\nare presented to illustrate the performance of the different reduced-order\nmodeling methods.",

A crucial element for network performance is the protocol\nstack, namely the sets of rules and data formats that determine how the nodes\nin the network exchange information. A great effort has been put to devise\nformal techniques to synthesize (offline) network protocols, starting from\nsystem specifications and strict assumptions on the network environment.\nHowever, offline design can be hard to apply in the most modern network\napplications, either due to numerical complexity, or to the fact that the\nenvironment might be unknown and the specifications might not available. In\nthese cases, online protocol design and adaptation has the potential to offer a\nmuch more scalable and robust solution. Nevertheless, so far only a few\nattempts have been done towards online automatic protocol design. Here, we\nenvision a protocol as an emergent property of a network, obtained by an\nenvironment-driven Distributed Hill Climbing algorithm that uses node-local\nreinforcement signals to evolve, at runtime and without any central\ncoordination, a network protocol from scratch. We test this approach with a\n3-state Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) Medium Access Control (MAC)\nprotocol and we observe its emergence in networks of various scales and with\nvarious settings.

The VEM is a Galerkin\napproach that is applicable to meshes that consist of arbitrarily-shaped\npolygonal and polyhedral (simple and nonsimple) elements. In the VEM, the basis\nfunctions are defined as the solution of a local elliptic partial differential\nequation, and are never explicitly computed in the implementation of the\nmethod. The stifness matrix of each element is built by using the elliptic\nprojection operator of the internal virtual work (bilinear form) and it\nconsists of two terms: a consistency term that is exactly computed (linear\npatch test is satisfied) and a correction term (ensures stability) that is\northogonal to affine displacement fields and has the right scaling. The VEM\nsimplifies mesh generation for a multiphase composite: a stiff inclusion can be\nmodeled using a single polygonal or polyhedral element. Attributes of the\nvirtual element approach are highlighted through comparisons with Voronoi-cell\nlattice models, which provide discrete representations of material structure.\nThe comparisons involve a suite of two-dimensional linear elastic problems:\npatch test, axisymmetric circular inclusion problem, and the deformation of a\nthree-phase composite.

    "abstract": "Natural disasters can have devastating and long-lasting effects on a\ncommunity's emotional well-being. These effects may be distributed unequally,\naffecting some communities more profoundly and possibly over longer time\nperiods than others. Here, we analyze the effects of four major US hurricanes,\nnamely, Irma, Harvey, Florence, and Dorian on the emotional well-being of the\naffected communities and regions. We show that a community's emotional response\nto a hurricane event can be measured from the content of social media that its\npopulation posted before, during, and after the hurricane. For each hurricane\nmaking landfall in the US, we observe a significant decrease in sentiment in\nthe affected areas before and during the hurricane followed by a rapid return\nto pre-hurricane baseline, often within 1-2 weeks. However, some communities\nexhibit markedly different rates of decline and return to previous equilibrium\nlevels. This points towards the possibility of measuring the emotional\nresilience of communities from the dynamics of their online emotional response.",

    "abstract": "Named Data Networking (NDN) is a top-notched architecture to deal with\ncontent distribution over the Internet. With the explosion of video streaming\ntransmission and future massive Internet of Things and Vehicles (IoT/IoV)\ntraffic, evolving Wi-Fi networks will play an essential role in such\necosystems. However, Native NDN deployment over wireless networks may not\nperform well. Wi-Fi broadcasts/multicasts result in reduced throughput due to\nthe usage of basic service mode. Despite recent initial works addressing that\nissue, further studies and proposals are required to boost the adoption of\nNative NDN. We advocate that an initial step towards designing a feasible\nNative NDN over wireless networks should be understanding the challenges in\nemerging scenarios and providing a uniform baseline to compare and advance\nproposals. To this end, first, we highlight some challenges and directions to\nimprove throughput and energy efficiency, reduce processing overhead, and\nsecurity issues. Next, we propose a variant of NDN that minimizes the problems\nidentified by performing transmission via unicast to avoid storms in wireless\nnetworks. Finally, we conducted a performance evaluation to compare Standard\nNative NDN with our proposal on Wi-Fi 6 vehicular networks. The results show\nthat our proposal outperforms the Standard NDN in the evaluated scenarios,\nreaching values close to 89% of satisfied requests, achieving more than 200% of\ndata received than Standard NDN.",

On the one hand, we consider the universal\nmodel checking problem for LTL, where one asks that for a given system and a\ngiven formula all the runs of the system satisfy the formula. On the other\nhand, the fair model checking problem for LTL asks that for a given system and\na given formula almost all the runs of the system satisfy the formula. It was\nshown that these two problems have the same theoretical complexity i.e.\nPSPACE-complete. The question arises whether one can find a fragment of LTL for\nwhich the complexity of these two problems differs. One such fragment was\nidentified in a previous work, namely the Muller fragment. We address a similar\ncomparison for the prompt fragment of LTL (pLTL). pLTL extends LTL with an\nadditional operator, i.e. the prompt-eventually. This operator ensures the\nexistence of a bound such that liveness properties are satisfied within this\nbound. We show that the corresponding Muller fragment for pLTL does not enjoy\nthe same algorithmic properties with respect to the comparison considered. We\nalso identify a new expressive fragment for which the fair model checking is\nfaster than the universal one.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding methods are important for knowledge graph\ncompletion (link prediction) due to their robust performance and efficiency on\nlarge-magnitude datasets. One state-of-the-art method, PairRE, leverages two\nseparate vectors for relations to model complex relations (i.e., 1-to-N,\nN-to-1, and N-to-N) in knowledge graphs. However, such a method strictly\nrestricts entities on the hyper-ellipsoid surface and thus limits the\noptimization of entity distribution, which largely hinders the performance of\nknowledge graph completion. To address this problem, we propose a novel score\nfunction TransHER, which leverages relation-specific translations between head\nand tail entities restricted on separate hyper-ellipsoids. Specifically, given\na triplet, our model first maps entities onto two separate hyper-ellipsoids and\nthen conducts a relation-specific translation on one of them. The\nrelation-specific translation provides TransHER with more direct guidance in\noptimization and the ability to learn semantic characteristics of entities with\ncomplex relations. Experimental results show that TransHER can achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance and generalize to datasets in different domains\nand scales. All our code will be publicly available.",

The status quo is tabula rasa in vivo, i.e. learning visual\nrepresentations from scratch while also learning to move, potentially augmented\nwith auxiliary tasks (e.g. predicting the action taken between two successive\nobservations). In this paper, we show that an alternative 2-stage strategy is\nfar more effective: (1) offline pretraining of visual representations with\nself-supervised learning (SSL) using large-scale pre-rendered images of indoor\nenvironments (Omnidata), and (2) online finetuning of visuomotor\nrepresentations on specific tasks with image augmentations under long learning\nschedules.

Localization using only one camera can be challenging in\nmedium-to-large-sized environments because similar-looking images are often\nobserved repeatedly, especially in indoor environments. To overcome this issue,\nwe propose a learning-based localization method that simultaneously utilizes\nthe spatial consistency from topological maps and the temporal consistency from\ntime-series images captured by the robot. Our method combines a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) to embed image features and a recurrent-type graph neural\nnetwork to perform accurate localization.

    "abstract": "Medical imaging plays a significant role in clinical practice of medical\ndiagnosis, where the text reports of the images are essential in understanding\nthem and facilitating later treatments. By generating the reports\nautomatically, it is beneficial to help lighten the burden of radiologists and\nsignificantly promote clinical automation, which already attracts much\nattention in applying artificial intelligence to medical domain. Previous\nstudies mainly follow the encoder-decoder paradigm and focus on the aspect of\ntext generation, with few studies considering the importance of cross-modal\nmappings and explicitly exploit such mappings to facilitate radiology report\ngeneration. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal memory networks (CMN) to\nenhance the encoder-decoder framework for radiology report generation, where a\nshared memory is designed to record the alignment between images and texts so\nas to facilitate the interaction and generation across modalities. Experimental\nresults illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, where\nstate-of-the-art performance is achieved on two widely used benchmark datasets,\ni.e., IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR. Further analyses also prove that our model is\nable to better align information from radiology images and texts so as to help\ngenerating more accurate reports in terms of clinical indicators.",

    "abstract": "The accuracy of deep neural networks is degraded when the distribution of\nfeatures in the test environment (target domain) differs from that of the\ntraining (source) environment. To mitigate the degradation, test-time\nadaptation (TTA), where a model adapts to the target domain without access to\nthe source dataset, can be used in the test environment. However, the existing\nTTA methods lack feature distribution alignment between the source and target\ndomains, which unsupervised domain adaptation mainly addresses, because\naccessing the source dataset is prohibited in the TTA setting. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel TTA method, named Covariance-Aware Feature alignment (CAFe),\nwhich explicitly aligns the source and target feature distributions at test\ntime. To perform alignment without accessing the source data, CAFe uses\nauxiliary feature statistics (mean and covariance) pre-computed on the source\ndomain, which are lightweight and easily prepared. Further, to improve\nefficiency and stability, we propose feature grouping, which splits the feature\ndimensions into groups according to their correlations by using spectral\nclustering to avoid degeneration of the covariance matrix.

While the training of\nspiking neural networks is still an open problem. One effective way is to map\nthe weight of trained ANN to SNN to achieve high reasoning ability. However,\nthe converted spiking neural network often suffers from performance degradation\nand a considerable time delay. To speed up the inference process and obtain\nhigher accuracy, we theoretically analyze the errors in the conversion process\nfrom three perspectives: the differences between IF and ReLU, time dimension,\nand pooling operation.

In addition,\nLateral Inhibition Pooling (LIPooling) is proposed to solve the inaccuracy\nproblem caused by MaxPooling in the conversion process. Experimental results on\nCIFAR and ImageNet demonstrate that our algorithm is efficient and accurate.\nFor example, our method can ensure nearly lossless conversion of SNN and only\nuse about 1/10 (less than 100) simulation time under 0.693$\\times$ energy\nconsumption of the typical method.

These cyborgs\ninherit the living insects' amazing locomotory skills, a flexible but robust\nbody structure, a vast collection of sensory organs, and a top-notch central\nnervous control system, favoring their maneuvers in complex and unstructured\nterrains, such as post-disaster environments. However, the development of\nautomatic navigation for these terrestrial cyborg insects has not yet been\ncomprehensively studied. The struggle in selecting stimulation parameters for\nindividual insects challenges the attainment of their reliable and accurate\nnavigations. This study demonstrates the implementation of feedback control to\novercome this obstacle and provides a detailed look at the navigation control\nfor terrestrial cyborg insects. Herein, a feedback control system is developed\nto realize the automatic navigation of a darkling beetle. Using a thrust\ncontroller for the beetle's acceleration and a proportional controller for its\nturning motion, the system alters the stimulation command (i.e., left/right\nturn, forward motion) and its parameters (i.e., frequency) depending on the\nbeetle's instantaneous status. Adjusting the system's control parameters allows\nthe beetle to be reliably and precisely navigated following a predetermined\npath with a success rate of ~80% and an accuracy of ~10 mm. Moreover, the\nsystem allows altering its performance by regulating the control parameters,\nproviding flexibility to navigation applications of terrestrial cyborg insects.",

Based on the\nidea, we propose the Staged Sparse Row (SSR) sparse matrix representation that\ncan efficiently cover applications on structured grids. With SSR\nrepresentation, users can intuitively define SSR matrices using generator\nfunctions and use SSR matrices through a concise object-oriented interface. SSR\nmatrices can then be chained and applied to construct the algorithm, including\nthose with loop-carried dependences. We then apply a set of dedicated\noptimizations, and ultimately simplify the SSR matrix-based codes into\nstraightforward matrix-free ones, which are efficient and friendly for further\nanalysis.\nImplementing BT pseudo application in the NAS Parallel Benchmark, with less\nthan $10\\%$ lines of code compared with the matrix-free reference FORTRAN\nimplementation, we achieved up to $92.8\\%$ performance.

    "title": "The Effect of Preferences in Abstract Argumentation Under a  Claim-Centric View",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the effect of preferences in abstract argumentation\nunder a claim-centric perspective. Recent work has revealed that semantical and\ncomputational properties can change when reasoning is performed on claim-level\nrather than on the argument-level, while under certain natural restrictions\n(arguments with the same claims have the same outgoing attacks) these\nproperties are conserved. We now investigate these effects when, in addition,\npreferences have to be taken into account and consider four prominent\nreductions to handle preferences between arguments. As we shall see, these\nreductions give rise to different classes of claim-augmented argumentation\nframeworks, and behave differently in terms of semantic properties and\ncomputational complexity. This strengthens the view that the actual choice for\nhandling preferences has to be taken with care.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the seminal algorithms AlphaGo and AlphaZero have started a new era\nin game learning and deep reinforcement learning. While the achievements of\nAlphaGo and AlphaZero - playing Go and other complex games at super human level\n- are truly impressive, these architectures have the drawback that they are\nvery complex and require high computational resources. Many researchers are\nlooking for methods that are similar to AlphaZero, but have lower computational\ndemands and are thus more easily reproducible. In this paper, we pick an\nimportant element of AlphaZero - the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning\nstage - and combine it with reinforcement learning (RL) agents. We wrap MCTS\nfor the first time around RL n-tuple networks to create versatile agents that\nkeep at the same time the computational demands low. We apply this new\narchitecture to several complex games (Othello, ConnectFour, Rubik's Cube) and\nshow the advantages achieved with this AlphaZero-inspired MCTS wrapper. In\nparticular, we present results that this AlphaZero-inspired agent is the first\none trained on standard hardware (no GPU or TPU) to beat the very strong\nOthello program Edax up to and including level 7 (where most other algorithms\ncould only defeat Edax up to level 2).",

Through a toy experiment, we find that perturbing the clean data to the\ndecision boundary but not crossing it does not degrade the test accuracy.\nInspired by this, we propose friendly adversarial data augmentation (FADA) to\ngenerate friendly adversarial data. On top of FADA, we propose geometry-aware\nadversarial training (GAT) to perform adversarial training on friendly\nadversarial data so that we can save a large number of search steps.\nComprehensive experiments across two widely used datasets and three pre-trained\nlanguage models demonstrate that GAT can obtain stronger robustness via fewer\nsteps.

It can be used to enhance black-and-white images, including\nblack-and-white photos, old-fashioned films, and scientific imaging results. On\nthe contrary, decolorization is to convert a color image or video into a\ngrayscale one. A grayscale image or video refers to an image or video with only\nbrightness information without color information. It is the basis of some\ndownstream image processing applications such as pattern recognition, image\nsegmentation, and image enhancement. Different from image decolorization, video\ndecolorization should not only consider the image contrast preservation in each\nvideo frame, but also respect the temporal and spatial consistency between\nvideo frames. Researchers were devoted to develop decolorization methods by\nbalancing spatial-temporal consistency and algorithm efficiency. With the\nprevalance of the digital cameras and mobile phones, image and video\ncolorization and decolorization have been paid more and more attention by\nresearchers.

    "abstract": "Vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) is urgently demanded to alleviate\nthepressure caused by the increasingly onerous task of urban traffic\nmanagement. Multiple challenges hamper the applications of vision-based vehicle\nRe-ID methods: (1) The appearances of different vehicles of the same\nbrand/model are often similar; However, (2) the appearances of the same vehicle\ndiffer significantly from different viewpoints. Previous methods mainly use\nmanually annotated multi-attribute datasets to assist the network in getting\ndetailed cues and in inferencing multi-view to improve the vehicle Re-ID\nperformance. However, finely labeled vehicle datasets are usually unattainable\nin real application scenarios. Hence, we propose a Discriminative-Region\nAttention and Orthogonal-View Generation (DRA-OVG) model, which only requires\nidentity (ID) labels to conquer the multiple challenges of vehicle Re-ID.The\nproposed DRA model can automatically extract the discriminative region\nfeatures, which can distinguish similar vehicles. And the OVG model can\ngenerate multi-view features based on the input view features to reduce the\nimpact of viewpoint mismatches. Finally, the distance between vehicle\nappearances is presented by the discriminative region features and multi-view\nfeatures together. Therefore, the significance of pairwise distance measure\nbetween vehicles is enhanced in acomplete feature space. Extensive experiments\nsubstantiate the effectiveness of each proposed ingredient, and experimental\nresults indicate that our approach achieves remarkable improvements over the\nstate- of-the-art vehicle Re-ID methods on VehicleID and VeRi-776 datasets.",

Achieving controllability is important especially when\nthe image captioner is used by different people with different way of\ninterpreting the images. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for\nimage captioning which can generate diverse descriptions by capturing the\nco-dependence between Part-Of-Speech tags and semantics.

In this way, it allows the\ndecoder to exhaustively search through the latent Part-Of-Speech choices, while\nkeeping decoding speed proportional to the size of the POS vocabulary. Given a\ncontrol signal in the form of a sequence of Part-Of-Speech tags, we propose a\nmethod to generate captions through a Transformer network, which predicts words\nbased on the input Part-Of-Speech tag sequences.

Indeed, it points to one key characteristic of\nrobotic systems: they are mere slaves, have no rights, and execute our wills\ninstruction by instruction, without asking anything in return. The relationship\nwith us humans is commensalism; in biology, commensalism subsists between two\nsymbiotic species when one species benefits from it (robots boost productivity\nfor humans), while the other species neither benefits nor is harmed (can you\nreally argue that robots benefit from simply functioning?).\nWe then distinguish robots from \"living machines\", that is, machines infused\nwith life. If living machines should ever become a reality, we would need to\nshift our relationship with them from commensalism to mutualism. The\ndistinction is not subtle: we experience it every day with domesticated\nanimals, that exchange serfdom for forage and protection. This is because life\nhas evolved to resist any attempt at enslaving it; it is stubborn.\nIn the path towards living machines, let us ask: what has been achieved by\nrobotics in the last $100$ years? What is left to accomplish in the next $100$\nyears? For us, the answers boil down to three words: juice, need (or death),\nand embodiment, as we shall see in the following.",

In this case, actually we analyze a more\ngeneral queue called probabilistic preemption Ber/G/1/1, where the packet\nservice is allowed to be preempted with certain probabilities. As a special\ncase, stationary AoI-distribution for the system with Ber/Geo/1/1 queue is\nobtained either. For the system having size 2, two specific queues are\nconsidered, i.e., the Ber/Geo/1/2 and Ber/Geo/1/2* queues. The core idea to\nfind the stationary AoI-distribution is that the random transitions of\nthree-dimensional vector including AoI at the receiver, the packet age in\nservice, and the age of waiting packet can be fully described, such that a\nthree-dimensional AoI process is constituted. The stationary distribution of\nthree-dimensional process then gives the stationary AoI distribution as one of\nits marginal distributions. For both cases, the explicit expressions of\nAoI-distribution are derived, thus giving the complete description of the\nsteady state AoI for the system.

    "title": "An Overview of Color Transfer and Style Transfer for Images and Videos",
    "abstract": "Image or video appearance features (e.g., color, texture, tone, illumination,\nand so on) reflect one's visual perception and direct impression of an image or\nvideo. Given a source image (video) and a target image (video), the image\n(video) color transfer technique aims to process the color of the source image\nor video (note that the source image or video is also referred to the reference\nimage or video in some literature) to make it look like that of the target\nimage or video, i.e., transferring the appearance of the target image or video\nto that of the source image or video, which can thereby change one's perception\nof the source image or video. As an extension of color transfer, style transfer\nrefers to rendering the content of a target image or video in the style of an\nartist with either a style sample or a set of images through a style transfer\nmodel. As an emerging field, the study of style transfer has attracted the\nattention of a large number of researchers. After decades of development, it\nhas become a highly interdisciplinary research with a variety of artistic\nexpression styles can be achieved. This paper provides an overview of color\ntransfer and style transfer methods over the past years.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved great success in image restoration.\nHowever, most DNN methods are designed as a black box, lacking transparency and\ninterpretability. Although some methods are proposed to combine traditional\noptimization algorithms with DNN, they usually demand pre-defined degradation\nprocesses or handcrafted assumptions, making it difficult to deal with complex\nand real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a Deep Generalized\nUnfolding Network (DGUNet) for image restoration. Concretely, without loss of\ninterpretability, we integrate a gradient estimation strategy into the gradient\ndescent step of the Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm, driving it to\ndeal with complex and real-world image degradation. In addition, we design\ninter-stage information pathways across proximal mapping in different PGD\niterations to rectify the intrinsic information loss in most deep unfolding\nnetworks (DUN) through a multi-scale and spatial-adaptive way. By integrating\nthe flexible gradient descent and informative proximal mapping, we unfold the\niterative PGD algorithm into a trainable DNN.

This poses a challenge\nparticularly in intelligent diagnosis systems where initially only training\ndata of a limited number of diseases are available. In this case, updating the\nintelligent system with data of new diseases would inevitably downgrade its\nperformance on previously learned diseases. Inspired by the process of learning\nnew knowledge in human brains, we propose a Bayesian generative model for\ncontinual learning built on a fixed pre-trained feature extractor. In this\nmodel, knowledge of each old class can be compactly represented by a collection\nof statistical distributions, e.g. with Gaussian mixture models, and naturally\nkept from forgetting in continual learning over time.

    "abstract": "Optimisation is a popular tool of generating control laws for motion planning\nin a complex environment. The existence of multiple irregular obstacles in the\nworking space introduces nonconvex collision avoidance constraints, making the\noptimal control problem intractable. One efficient approach to address this\nissue is successive convex approximation (SCA), where the nonconvex problem is\nconvexified and solved successively. However, this approach still faces two\nmain challenges: 1) high computational complexity, incurred by multiple\nconstraints when solving the optimal control problem with a long planning\nhorizon and multiple obstacles; 2) infeasibility, caused by linearization about\ninfeasible reference points. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a\nbackward receding SCA (BRSCA) approach, which leverages dynamic programming\nwith a primal-dual iteration to decrease computational complexity; and designs\na dynamic constraints-selection rule to avoid infeasibility. Moreover, it is\nfound that the proposed BRSCA approach is applicable to time-varying control\nlimits. Numerical simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate that BRSCA\nhas a higher probability of finding feasible solutions and reduces the\ncomputation time by at least 17.4%, compared to other methodologies in the\nliterature.",

Unfortunately, contrastive ICR\nmethods are vulnerable to learning shortcuts: decision rules that perform well\non the training data but fail to transfer to other testing conditions. We\nintroduce an approach to reduce shortcut feature representations for the ICR\ntask: latent target decoding (LTD). We add an additional decoder to the\nlearning framework to reconstruct the input caption, which prevents the image\nand caption encoder from learning shortcut features. Instead of reconstructing\ninput captions in the input space, we decode the semantics of the caption in a\nlatent space. We implement the LTD objective as an optimization constraint, to\nensure that the reconstruction loss is below a threshold value while primarily\noptimizing for the contrastive loss. Importantly, LTD does not depend on\nadditional training data or expensive (hard) negative mining strategies. Our\nexperiments show that, unlike reconstructing the input caption, LTD reduces\nshortcut learning and improves generalizability by obtaining higher recall@k\nand r-precision scores.

Then, the article deconstructs existing Byzantine-tolerant\nasynchronous broadcast algorithms and, with the help of the \\kl-cast\ncommunication abstraction, reconstructs versions of them that tolerate both\nByzantine processes and message adversaries.

    "abstract": "With the ever increasing data deluge and the success of deep neural networks,\nthe research of distributed deep learning has become pronounced. Two common\napproaches to achieve this distributed learning is synchronous and asynchronous\nweight update. In this manuscript, we have explored very simplistic synchronous\nweight update mechanisms. It has been seen that with an increasing number of\nworker nodes, the performance degrades drastically. This effect has been\nstudied in the context of extreme imbalanced classification (e.g. outlier\ndetection). In practical cases, the assumed conditions of i.i.d. may not be\nfulfilled. There may also arise global class imbalance situations like that of\noutlier detection where the local servers receive severely imbalanced data and\nmay not get any samples from the minority class. In that case, the DNNs in the\nlocal servers will get completely biased towards the majority class that they\nreceive. This would highly impact the learning at the parameter server (which\npractically does not see any data). It has been observed that in a parallel\nsetting if one uses the existing federated weight update mechanisms at the\nparameter server, the performance degrades drastically with the increasing\nnumber of worker nodes. This is mainly because, with the increasing number of\nnodes, there is a high chance that one worker node gets a very small portion of\nthe data, either not enough to train the model without overfitting or having a\nhighly imbalanced class distribution. The chapter, hence, proposes a workaround\nto this problem by introducing the concept of adaptive cost-sensitive momentum\naveraging. It is seen that for the proposed system, there was no to minimal\ndegradation in performance while most of the other methods hit their bottom\nperformance before that.",

    "abstract": "Rain is one of the most common weather which can completely degrade the image\nquality and interfere with the performance of many computer vision tasks,\nespecially under heavy rain conditions. We observe that: (i) rain is a mixture\nof rain streaks and rainy haze; (ii) the scene depth determines the intensity\nof rain streaks and the transformation into the rainy haze; (iii) most existing\nderaining methods are only trained on synthetic rainy images, and hence\ngeneralize poorly to the real-world scenes. Motivated by these observations, we\npropose a new SEMI-supervised Mixture Of rain REmoval Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (Semi-MoreGAN), which consists of four key modules: (I) a novel\nattentional depth prediction network to provide precise depth estimation; (ii)\na context feature prediction network composed of several well-designed detailed\nresidual blocks to produce detailed image context features; (iii) a pyramid\ndepth-guided non-local network to effectively integrate the image context with\nthe depth information, and produce the final rain-free images; and (iv) a\ncomprehensive semi-supervised loss function to make the model not limited to\nsynthetic datasets but generalize smoothly to real-world heavy rainy scenes.\nExtensive experiments show clear improvements of our approach over twenty\nrepresentative state-of-the-arts on both synthetic and real-world rainy images.",

    "abstract": "Stock prices are highly volatile and sudden changes in trends are often very\nproblematic for traditional forecasting models to handle. The standard Long\nShort Term Memory (LSTM) networks are regarded as the state-of-the-art models\nfor such predictions. But, these models fail to handle sudden and drastic\nchanges in the price trend. Moreover, there are some inherent constraints with\nthe open, high, low and close (OHLC) prices of the stocks. Literature lacks the\nstudy on the inherent property of OHLC prices. We argue that predicting the\nOHLC prices for the next day is much more informative than predicting the\ntrends of the stocks as the trend is mostly calculated using these OHLC prices\nonly. The problem mainly is focused on Buy-Today Sell-Tomorrow (BTST) trading.\nIn this regard, AEs when pre-trained with the stock prices, may be beneficial.\nA novel framework is proposed where a pre-trained encoder is cascaded in front\nof the multi-task predictor network. This hybrid network can leverage the power\nof a combination of networks and can both handle the OHLC constraints as well\nas capture any sudden drastic changes in the prices. It is seen that such a\nnetwork is much more efficient at predicting stock prices. The experiments have\nbeen extended to recommend the most profitable and most overbought stocks on\nthe next day. The model has been tested for multiple Indian companies and it is\nfound that the recommendations from the proposed model have not resulted in a\nsingle loss for a test period of 300 days.",

    "title": "Hybrid Relation Guided Set Matching for Few-shot Action Recognition",
    "abstract": "Current few-shot action recognition methods reach impressive performance by\nlearning discriminative features for each video via episodic training and\ndesigning various temporal alignment strategies. Nevertheless, they are limited\nin that (a) learning individual features without considering the entire task\nmay lose the most relevant information in the current episode, and (b) these\nalignment strategies may fail in misaligned instances. To overcome the two\nlimitations, we propose a novel Hybrid Relation guided Set Matching (HyRSM)\napproach that incorporates two key components: hybrid relation module and set\nmatching metric. The purpose of the hybrid relation module is to learn\ntask-specific embeddings by fully exploiting associated relations within and\ncross videos in an episode. Built upon the task-specific features, we\nreformulate distance measure between query and support videos as a set matching\nproblem and further design a bidirectional Mean Hausdorff Metric to improve the\nresilience to misaligned instances. By this means, the proposed HyRSM can be\nhighly informative and flexible to predict query categories under the few-shot\nsettings. We evaluate HyRSM on six challenging benchmarks, and the experimental\nresults show its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods by a convincing\nmargin.

    "abstract": "In recent years, phishing scams have become the most serious type of crime\ninvolved in Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain platform. The existing\nphishing scams detection technology on Ethereum mostly uses traditional machine\nlearning or network representation learning to mine the key information from\nthe transaction network to identify phishing addresses. However, these methods\nadopt the last transaction record or even completely ignore these records, and\nonly manual-designed features are taken for the node representation. In this\npaper, we propose a Temporal Transaction Aggregation Graph Network (TTAGN) to\nenhance phishing scams detection performance on Ethereum. Specifically, in the\ntemporal edges representation module, we model the temporal relationship of\nhistorical transaction records between nodes to construct the edge\nrepresentation of the Ethereum transaction network. Moreover, the edge\nrepresentations around the node are aggregated to fuse topological interactive\nrelationships into its representation, also named as trading features, in the\nedge2node module. We further combine trading features with common statistical\nand structural features obtained by graph neural networks to identify phishing\naddresses. Evaluated on real-world Ethereum phishing scams datasets, our TTAGN\n(92.8% AUC, and 81.6% F1score) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and\nthe effectiveness of temporal edges representation and edge2node module is also\ndemonstrated.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the channel impulse response (CIR), i.e., the\nmolecule hitting rate, of a molecular communication (MC) system employing an\nabsorbing receiver (RX) covered by multiple non overlapping receptors. In this\nsystem, receptors are heterogeneous, i.e., they may have different sizes and\narbitrary locations. Furthermore, we consider two types of transmitter (TX),\nnamely a point TX and a membrane fusion (MF)-based spherical TX. We assume the\npoint TX or the center of the MF-based TX has a fixed distance to the center of\nthe RX. Given this fixed distance, the TX can be at different locations and the\nCIR of the RX depends on the exact location of the TX. By averaging over all\npossible TX locations, we analyze the expected molecule hitting rate at the RX\nas a function of the sizes and locations of the receptors, where we assume\nmolecule degradation may occur during the propagation of the signaling\nmolecules. Notably, our analysis is valid for different numbers, a wide range\nof sizes, and arbitrary locations of the receptors, and its accuracy is\nconfirmed via particle-based simulations. Exploiting our numerical results, we\nshow that the expected number of absorbed molecules at the RX increases with\nthe number of receptors, when the total area on the RX surface covered by\nreceptors is fixed. Based on the derived analytical expressions, we compare\ndifferent geometric receptor distributions by examining the expected number of\nabsorbed molecules at the RX. We show that evenly distributed receptors result\nin a larger number of absorbed molecules than other distributions. We further\ncompare three models that combine different types of TXs and RXs.",

Specifically, the input is a finite ordered sequence of\npackets that arrive in both directions along a link. Given $(u, v)$ and a\npacket of weight $x$ going from $u$ to $v$, player $u$ can either accept or\nreject the packet. If player $u$ accepts the packet, their capacity on link\n$(u,v)$ decreases by $x$. Correspondingly, player $v$ capacity on $(u,v)$\nincreases by $x$. If a player rejects the packet, this will entail a cost\nlinear in the weight of the packet. A link is \"rechargeable\" in the sense that\nthe total capacity of the link has to remain constant, but the allocation of\ncapacity at the ends of the link can depend arbitrarily on players' decisions.\nThe goal is to minimise the sum of the capacity injected into the link and the\ncost of rejecting packets. We show the problem is NP-hard, but can be\napproximated efficiently with a ratio of $(1+ \\varepsilon)\\cdot (1+\\sqrt{3})$\nfor some arbitrary $\\varepsilon >0$.",

    "abstract": "Communicating systems comprise diverse software components across networks.\nTo ensure their robustness, modern programming languages such as Rust provide\nboth strongly typed channels, whose usage is guaranteed to be affine (at most\nonce), and cancellation operations over binary channels. For coordinating\ncomponents to correctly communicate and synchronise with each other, we use the\nstructuring mechanism from multiparty session types, extending it with affine\ncommunication channels and implicit/explicit cancellation mechanisms. This new\ntyping discipline, affine multiparty session types (AMPST), ensures\ncancellation termination of multiple, independently running components and\nguarantees that communication will not get stuck due to error or abrupt\ntermination. Guided by AMPST, we implemented an automated generation tool\n(MultiCrusty) of Rust APIs associated with cancellation termination algorithms,\nby which the Rust compiler auto-detects unsafe programs. Our evaluation shows\nthat MultiCrusty provides an efficient mechanism for communication,\nsynchronisation and propagation of the notifications of cancellation for\narbitrary processes.

In such cases, one might be interested in\nmodifying the instance so that the existence of a stable outcome with the\ndesired properties is ensured.\nWe focus on three different modifications. In stable roommates problems with\nall capacities being one, we give a simpler proof to show that removing an\nagent from each odd cycle of a stable partition is optimal. We further show\nthat the problem becomes NP-complete if the capacities are greater than one, or\nthe deleted agents must belong to a fixed subset of vertices.\nMotivated by inverse optimization problems, we investigate how to modify the\npreferences of the agents as little as possible so that a given matching\nbecomes stable. The deviation of the new preferences from the original ones can\nbe measured in various ways; here we concentrate on the $\\ell_1$-norm. We show\nthat, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, the problem does not admit a better\nthan $2$ approximation. By relying on bipartite-submodular functions, we give a\npolynomial-time algorithm for the bipartite case. We also show that a similar\napproach leads to a 2-approximation for general graphs.\nLast, we consider problems where the preferences of agents are not fully\nprescribed, and the goal is to decide whether the preference lists can be\nextended so that a stable matching exists.

In contrast to conventional methods\nwhere compute time grows at least linearly with the network depth, we aim to\nupdate the representations in a continuous manner. For this purpose, we\nleverage the recently emerging implicit layer model which infers the\nrepresentation of an image by solving a fixed-point problem. Our main insight\nis to leverage the slowly changing nature of videos and use the previous frame\nrepresentation as an initial condition on each frame.

Hyperspectral images are often generated in large quantities at a\nrelatively coarse spatial resolution. As such, unsupervised machine learning\nalgorithms incorporating known structure in hyperspectral imagery are needed to\nanalyze these images automatically. This work introduces the Spatial-Spectral\nImage Reconstruction and Clustering with Diffusion Geometry (DSIRC) algorithm\nfor partitioning highly mixed hyperspectral images. DSIRC reduces measurement\nnoise through a shape-adaptive reconstruction procedure. In particular, for\neach pixel, DSIRC locates spectrally correlated pixels within a data-adaptive\nspatial neighborhood and reconstructs that pixel's spectral signature using\nthose of its neighbors. DSIRC then locates high-density, high-purity pixels far\nin diffusion distance (a data-dependent distance metric) from other\nhigh-density, high-purity pixels and treats these as cluster exemplars, giving\neach a unique label. Non-modal pixels are assigned the label of their diffusion\ndistance-nearest neighbor of higher density and purity that is already labeled.\nStrong numerical results indicate that incorporating spatial information\nthrough image reconstruction substantially improves the performance of\npixel-wise clustering.",

We consider two types of feedback: sharing demand\ninformation (SDI) and sharing demand awareness (SDA), each of which provides\ndifferent signals of resource sharing. We design the DPE-SDI and SIC-SDA\nalgorithms to address the shareable arm problem under these two cases of\nfeedback respectively and prove that both algorithms have logarithmic regrets\nthat are tight in the number of rounds.

    "abstract": "Pre-trained large-scale language models such as BERT have gained a lot of\nattention thanks to their outstanding performance on a wide range of natural\nlanguage tasks. However, due to their large number of parameters, they are\nresource-intensive both to deploy and to fine-tune. Researchers have created\nseveral methods for distilling language models into smaller ones to increase\nefficiency, with a small performance trade-off. In this paper, we create\nseveral different distilled versions of the state-of-the-art Dutch RobBERT\nmodel and call them RobBERTje. The distillations differ in their distillation\ncorpus, namely whether or not they are shuffled and whether they are merged\nwith subsequent sentences. We found that the performance of the models using\nthe shuffled versus non-shuffled datasets is similar for most tasks and that\nrandomly merging subsequent sentences in a corpus creates models that train\nfaster and perform better on tasks with long sequences. Upon comparing\ndistillation architectures, we found that the larger DistilBERT architecture\nworked significantly better than the Bort hyperparametrization. Interestingly,\nwe also found that the distilled models exhibit less gender-stereotypical bias\nthan its teacher model. Since smaller architectures decrease the time to\nfine-tune, these models allow for more efficient training and more lightweight\ndeployment of many Dutch downstream language tasks.",

    "abstract": "In zero-shot multilingual extractive text summarization, a model is typically\ntrained on English summarization dataset and then applied on summarization\ndatasets of other languages. Given English gold summaries and documents,\nsentence-level labels for extractive summarization are usually generated using\nheuristics. However, these monolingual labels created on English datasets may\nnot be optimal on datasets of other languages, for that there is the syntactic\nor semantic discrepancy between different languages. In this way, it is\npossible to translate the English dataset to other languages and obtain\ndifferent sets of labels again using heuristics. To fully leverage the\ninformation of these different sets of labels, we propose NLSSum (Neural Label\nSearch for Summarization), which jointly learns hierarchical weights for these\ndifferent sets of labels together with our summarization model. We conduct\nmultilingual zero-shot summarization experiments on MLSUM and WikiLingua\ndatasets, and we achieve state-of-the-art results using both human and\nautomatic evaluations across these two datasets.",

However a\ndramatic lowering of the cost-per-kilogram to space has led to a recent\nexplosion in real and planned constellations in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) of\nsmaller satellites. These constellations are managed remotely and it is\nimportant to consider a scenario in which an attacker gains control over the\nconstituent satellites. In this paper we aim to understand what damage this\nattacker could cause, using the satellites to generate interference. To ground\nour analysis, we simulate a number of existing and planned LEO constellations\nagainst an example GEO constellation, and evaluate the relative effectiveness\nof each. Our model shows that with conservative power estimates, both current\nand planned constellations could disrupt GEO satellite services at every\ngroundstation considered, with effectiveness varying considerably between\nlocations. We analyse different patterns of interference, how they reflect the\nstructures of the constellations creating them, and how effective they might be\nagainst a number of legitimate services. We found that real-time usage (e.g.\ncalls, streaming) would be most affected, with 3 constellation designs able to\ngenerate thousands of outages of 30 seconds or longer over the course of the\nday across all groundstations.",

Aiming at this particular task we study how\nclassification results depend on $\\beta$ and find that the optimal phase\ndepends highly on the amount of labeled data available.

This method relies on a novel parameter\n$\\gamma$ and we then evaluate two different values of the said quantity in\ncomparison with classical methods in the field. This evaluation is conducted by\nchanging the amount of labeled data available and the number of nearest\nneighbors in the similarity graph. Empirical results show that the tuning\nmethod is effective and allows NMF to outperform other approaches in datasets\nwith fewer classes.

Our goal is\nto better understand the underlying mechanisms of the well-known fact that\npopularity bias can prevent higher-quality items from becoming more popular\nthan lower-quality items, producing an undesirable misalignment between quality\nand popularity rankings. We do so under the assumption that users, having\nlimited time/attention, are able to discriminate the best-quality only within a\nrandom subset of the items. We discover the existence of a harmful regime in\nwhich improper use of popularity can seriously compromise the emergence of\nquality, and a benign regime in which wise use of popularity, coupled with a\nsmall discrimination effort on behalf of users, guarantees the perfect\nalignment of quality and popularity ranking. Our findings clarify the effects\nof algorithmic popularity bias on quality outcomes, and may inform the design\nof more principled mechanisms for techno-social cultural markets.",

However there are\nnumerous challenges in achieving such a prediction with high accuracy, not\nleast because the queue's state can change rapidly and depend upon many\nfactors. In this work we explore a novel machine learning approach for\npredicting queue wait times, hypothesising that such a model can capture the\ncomplex behaviour resulting from the queue policy and other interactions to\ngenerate accurate job start times.\nFor ARCHER2 (HPE Cray EX), Cirrus (HPE 8600) and 4-cabinet (HPE Cray EX) we\nexplore how different machine learning approaches and techniques improve the\naccuracy of our predictions, comparing against the estimation generated by\nSlurm.

Due to the\nexpensive segment annotation procedure, we propose a weakly supervised\nalgorithm for localizing the goal-directed as well as unintentional temporal\nregions in the video leveraging solely video-level labels. In particular, we\nemploy an attention mechanism-based strategy that predicts the temporal regions\nwhich contribute the most to a classification task. Meanwhile, our designed\noverlap regularization allows the model to focus on distinct portions of the\nvideo for inferring the goal-directed and unintentional activity while\nguaranteeing their temporal ordering. Extensive quantitative experiments verify\nthe validity of our localization method. We further conduct a video captioning\nexperiment which demonstrates that the proposed localization module does indeed\nassist teleological action understanding.",

    "abstract": "Training deep learning (DL) models has become a norm. With the emergence of\nserverless computing and its benefits of true pay-as-you-go pricing and\nscalability, systems researchers have recently started to provide support for\nserverless-based training. However, the ability to train deep learning models\non serverless platforms is hindered by the inherent limitations of today's\nserverless infrastructure and the explosive requirement on memory and\nbandwidth. For example, existing AWS serverless functions have up to 10GB\nmemory and 70MB/s bandwidth while training an AmoebaNet-D model with batch size\n64 can require 45GB memory and transfer 900MB data per iteration. The appalling\nresource mismatch between serverless functions and DL models has stalled the\nprogress on serverless-based training.\nIn this paper, we present FuncPipe, the first pipelined serverless framework\nthat enables fast and low-cost training of DL models. FuncPipe is designed with\nthe key insight that model partitioning can be leveraged to bridge both memory\nand bandwidth gaps between the capacity of serverless functions and the\nrequirement of DL training. Conceptually simple, we have to answer a number of\ndesign questions including how to partition the model, how to configure each\nserverless function, and how to exploit each function's uplink/downlink\nbandwidth. We co-optimize model partition and resource allocation with a\nMixed-Integer Quadratic Programming formulation and redesign storage-based\ncommunication for efficient bandwidth usage. We implement FuncPipe on AWS and\nAliCloud and show that it achieves up to 77% cost savings and 2.2X speedup\ncomparing to state-of-the-art serverless-based frameworks.",

We introduce a novel differentiable inductive logic programming (ILP)\nmodel, called differentiable first-order rule learner (DFOL), which finds the\ncorrect LPs from relational facts by searching for the interpretable matrix\nrepresentations of LPs. These interpretable matrices are deemed as trainable\ntensors in neural networks (NNs). The NNs are devised according to the\ndifferentiable semantics of LPs. Specifically, we first adopt a novel\npropositionalization method that transfers facts to NN-readable vector pairs\nrepresenting interpretation pairs. We replace the immediate consequence\noperator with NN constraint functions consisting of algebraic operations and a\nsigmoid-like activation function. We map the symbolic forward-chained format of\nLPs into NN constraint functions consisting of operations between subsymbolic\nvector representations of atoms. By applying gradient descent, the trained well\nparameters of NNs can be decoded into precise symbolic LPs in forward-chained\nlogic format. We demonstrate that DFOL can perform on several standard ILP\ndatasets, knowledge bases, and probabilistic relation facts and outperform\nseveral well-known differentiable ILP models.

    "abstract": "Medical image registration is a fundamental and critical task in medical\nimage analysis. With the rapid development of deep learning, convolutional\nneural networks (CNN) have dominated the medical image registration field. Due\nto the disadvantage of the local receptive field of CNN, some recent\nregistration methods have focused on using transformers for non-local\nregistration. However, the standard Transformer has a vast number of parameters\nand high computational complexity, which causes Transformer can only be applied\nat the bottom of the registration models. As a result, only coarse information\nis available at the lowest resolution, limiting the contribution of Transformer\nin their models. To address these challenges, we propose a convolution-based\nefficient multi-head self-attention (CEMSA) block, which reduces the parameters\nof the traditional Transformer and captures local spatial context information\nfor reducing semantic ambiguity in the attention mechanism. Based on the\nproposed CEMSA, we present a novel Symmetric Transformer-based model\n(SymTrans). SymTrans employs the Transformer blocks in the encoder and the\ndecoder respectively to model the long-range spatial cross-image relevance. We\napply SymTrans to the displacement field and diffeomorphic registration.\nExperimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in image registration.

This work\naims to investigate the feasibility of continual learning for multicenter\ncollaboration on an exemplary application of brain metastasis identification\nusing DeepMedic. 920 T1 MRI contrast enhanced volumes are split to simulate\nmulticenter collaboration scenarios. A continual learning algorithm, synaptic\nintelligence (SI), is applied to preserve important model weights for training\none center after another. In a bilateral collaboration scenario, continual\nlearning with SI achieves a sensitivity of 0.917, and naive continual learning\nwithout SI achieves a sensitivity of 0.906, while two models trained on\ninternal data solely without continual learning achieve sensitivity of 0.853\nand 0.831 only. In a seven-center multilateral collaboration scenario, the\nmodels trained on internal datasets (100 volumes each center) without continual\nlearning obtain a mean sensitivity value of 0.725. With single-visit continual\nlearning (i.e., the shared model visits each center only once during training),\nthe sensitivity is improved to 0.788 and 0.849 without SI and with SI,\nrespectively. With iterative continual learning (i.e., the shared model\nrevisits each center multiple times during training), the sensitivity is\nfurther improved to 0.914, which is identical to the sensitivity using mixed\ndata for training.

One can use process data for many downstream\ntasks such as learning outcome prediction and automatically delivering\npersonalized intervention.

Often CEMs are formulated to model grid operations over\nrepresentative periods that are sampled from the original input data using\nclustering algorithms.

    "abstract": "A long-standing debate is whether social influence improves the collective\nwisdom of a crowd or undermines it. This paper addresses this question based on\na naive learning setting in influence systems theory: in our models individuals\nevolve their estimates of an unknown truth according to the weighted-average\nopinion dynamics. A formal mathematization is provided with rigorous\ntheoretical analysis. We obtain various conditions for improving, optimizing\nand undermining the crowd accuracy, respectively. We prove that if the wisdom\nof finite-size group is improved, then the collective estimate converges to the\ntruth as group size increases, provided individuals' variances are finite. We\nshow that whether social influence improves or undermines the wisdom is\ndetermined by the social power allocation of the influence system: if the\ninfluence system allocates relatively larger social power to relatively more\naccurate individuals, it improves the wisdom; on the contrary, if the influence\nsystem assigns less social power to more accurate individuals, it undermines\nthe wisdom. At a population level, individuals' susceptibilities to\ninterpersonal influence and network centralities are both crucial. To improve\nthe wisdom, more accurate individuals should be less susceptible and have\nlarger network centralities. Particularly, in democratic influence networks, if\nrelatively more accurate individuals are relatively less susceptible, the\nwisdom is improved; if more accurate individuals are more susceptible, the\nwisdom is undermined, which is consistent with the reported empirical evidence.\nOur investigation provides a theoretical framework for understanding the role\nsocial influence plays in the emergence of collective wisdom.",

    "abstract": "Computational homogenization is the gold standard for concurrent multi-scale\nsimulations (e.g., FE2) in scale-bridging applications. Experimental and\nsynthetic material microstructures are often represented by 3D image data. The\ncomputational complexity of simulations operating on such three-dimensional\nhigh-resolution voxel data comprising billions of unknowns induces the need for\nalgorithmically and numerically efficient solvers. The inability of voxelized\n3D geometries to capture smooth material interfaces accurately, along with the\nnecessity for complexity reduction, motivates a special local coarse-graining\ntechnique called composite voxels [Kabel,M. et al. (2015)]. Composite voxels\ncondense multiple fine-scale voxels into a single voxel obeying a\ntheory-inspired constitutive model by employing laminate theory. Composite\nvoxels enhance local field quality at a modest computational cost. Our\ncontribution comprises the generalization towards composite boxels (ComBo) that\nare nonequiaxed, a feature that can pay off for materials with a preferred\ndirection. A novel image-based normal detection algorithm is devised which\nimproves the accuracy by around 30\\% against the orientation cf. [Kabel,M. et\nal. (2015) ]. Further, the use of ComBo for finite strain simulations is\nstudied in detail. An efficient implementation is proposed, and an essential\nback-projection algorithm preventing physically inadmissible states is\ndeveloped, which improves robustness. Various examples show the efficiency of\nComBo and the proposed algorithmic enhancements for nonlinear mechanical\nproblems.

Yet most existing methods focus on equivariance\nregarding a global input rotation while ignoring the fact that rotation\nsymmetry has its own spatial support. Specifically, we consider the object\ndetection problem in 3D scenes, where an object bounding box should be\nequivariant regarding the object pose, independent of the scene motion. This\nsuggests a new desired property we call object-level rotation equivariance. To\nincorporate object-level rotation equivariance into 3D object detectors, we\nneed a mechanism to extract equivariant features with local object-level\nspatial support while being able to model cross-object context information. To\nthis end, we propose Equivariant Object detection Network (EON) with a rotation\nequivariance suspension design to achieve object-level equivariance. EON can be\napplied to modern point cloud object detectors, such as VoteNet and PointRCNN,\nenabling them to exploit object rotation symmetry in scene-scale inputs.

    "abstract": "Machine learning has advanced dramatically, narrowing the accuracy gap to\nhumans in multimodal tasks like visual question answering (VQA). However, while\nhumans can say \"I don't know\" when they are uncertain (i.e., abstain from\nanswering a question), such ability has been largely neglected in multimodal\nresearch, despite the importance of this problem to the usage of VQA in real\nsettings. In this work, we promote a problem formulation for reliable VQA,\nwhere we prefer abstention over providing an incorrect answer. We first enable\nabstention capabilities for several VQA models, and analyze both their\ncoverage, the portion of questions answered, and risk, the error on that\nportion. For that we explore several abstention approaches. We find that\nalthough the best performing models achieve over 71% accuracy on the VQA v2\ndataset, introducing the option to abstain by directly using a model's softmax\nscores limits them to answering less than 8% of the questions to achieve a low\nrisk of error (i.e., 1%). This motivates us to utilize a multimodal selection\nfunction to directly estimate the correctness of the predicted answers, which\nwe show can triple the coverage from, for example, 5.0% to 16.7% at 1% risk.\nWhile it is important to analyze both coverage and risk, these metrics have a\ntrade-off which makes comparing VQA models challenging. To address this, we\nalso propose an Effective Reliability metric for VQA that places a larger cost\non incorrect answers compared to abstentions. This new problem formulation,\nmetric, and analysis for VQA provide the groundwork for building effective and\nreliable VQA models that have the self-awareness to abstain if and only if they\ndon't know the answer.",

Recent approaches focus on utilizing color images as guidance\nimages to recover depth at invalid pixels. However, color images alone are not\nenough to provide the necessary semantic understanding of the scene.\nConsequently, the depth completion task suffers from sudden illumination\nchanges in RGB images (e.g., shadows). In this paper, we propose a novel\nthree-branch backbone comprising color-guided, semantic-guided, and\ndepth-guided branches. Specifically, the color-guided branch takes a sparse\ndepth map and RGB image as an input and generates color depth which includes\ncolor cues (e.g., object boundaries) of the scene. The predicted dense depth\nmap of color-guided branch along-with semantic image and sparse depth map is\npassed as input to semantic-guided branch for estimating semantic depth. The\ndepth-guided branch takes sparse, color, and semantic depths to generate the\ndense depth map. The color depth, semantic depth, and guided depth are\nadaptively fused to produce the output of our proposed three-branch backbone.\nIn addition, we also propose to apply semantic-aware multi-modal\nattention-based fusion block (SAMMAFB) to fuse features between all three\nbranches.

Existing\napproaches mainly assume that the roof and footprint of a building are well\noverlapped, which may not hold in off-nadir aerial images as there is often a\nbig offset between them. In this paper, we propose an offset vector learning\nscheme, which turns the building footprint extraction problem in off-nadir\nimages into an instance-level joint prediction problem of the building roof and\nits corresponding \"roof to footprint\" offset vector. Thus the footprint can be\nestimated by translating the predicted roof mask according to the predicted\noffset vector.

    "abstract": "Differential Privacy (DP) provides a formal privacy guarantee preventing\nadversaries with access to a machine learning model from extracting information\nabout individual training points. Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient\nDescent (DP-SGD), the most popular DP training method, realizes this protection\nby injecting noise during training. However previous works have found that\nDP-SGD often leads to a significant degradation in performance on standard\nimage classification benchmarks. Furthermore, some authors have postulated that\nDP-SGD inherently performs poorly on large models, since the norm of the noise\nrequired to preserve privacy is proportional to the model dimension. In\ncontrast, we demonstrate that DP-SGD on over-parameterized models can perform\nsignificantly better than previously thought. Combining careful hyper-parameter\ntuning with simple techniques to ensure signal propagation and improve the\nconvergence rate, we obtain a new SOTA on CIFAR-10 of 81.4% under (8,\n10^{-5})-DP using a 40-layer Wide-ResNet, improving over the previous SOTA of\n71.7%. When fine-tuning a pre-trained 200-layer Normalizer-Free ResNet, we\nachieve a remarkable 77.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet under (1, 8*10^{-7})-DP,\nand achieve 81.1% under (8, 8*10^{-7})-DP. This markedly exceeds the previous\nSOTA of 47.9% under a larger privacy budget of (10, 10^{-6})-DP. We believe our\nresults are a significant step towards closing the accuracy gap between private\nand non-private image classification.",

Such models have yet to match the\nability of biological vision to learn from multiple sources and generalize to\nnew data sources and tasks.

The seven tasks in GRIT are selected to cover a range of visual\nskills: object categorization, object localization, referring expression\ngrounding, visual question answering, segmentation, human keypoint detection,\nand surface normal estimation. GRIT is carefully designed to enable the\nevaluation of robustness under image perturbations, image source distribution\nshift, and concept distribution shift.

    "abstract": "In clinical practice, well-aligned multi-modal images, such as Magnetic\nResonance (MR) and Computed Tomography (CT), together can provide complementary\ninformation for image-guided therapies. Multi-modal image registration is\nessential for the accurate alignment of these multi-modal images. However, it\nremains a very challenging task due to complicated and unknown spatial\ncorrespondence between different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel\ntranslation-based unsupervised deformable image registration approach to\nconvert the multi-modal registration problem to a mono-modal one. Specifically,\nour approach incorporates a discriminator-free translation network to\nfacilitate the training of the registration network and a patchwise contrastive\nloss to encourage the translation network to preserve object shapes.\nFurthermore, we propose to replace an adversarial loss, that is widely used in\nprevious multi-modal image registration methods, with a pixel loss in order to\nintegrate the output of translation into the target modality. This leads to an\nunsupervised method requiring no ground-truth deformation or pairs of aligned\nimages for training. We evaluate four variants of our approach on the public\nLearn2Reg 2021 datasets \\cite{hering2021learn2reg}. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance. Our code is available at https://github.com/heyblackC/DFMIR.",

Articulated\nobjects are especially interesting since they often require the full dexterity\nof human hands to manipulate them. To understand, model, and synthesize such\ninteractions, automatic and robust methods that reconstruct hands and\narticulated objects in 3D from a color image are needed. Existing methods for\nestimating 3D hand and object pose from images focus on rigid objects. In part,\nbecause such methods rely on training data and no dataset of articulated object\nmanipulation exists. Consequently, we introduce ARCTIC - the first dataset of\nfree-form interactions of hands and articulated objects. ARCTIC has 1.2M images\npaired with accurate 3D meshes for both hands and for objects that move and\ndeform over time. The dataset also provides hand-object contact information. To\nshow the value of our dataset, we perform two novel tasks on ARCTIC: (1) 3D\nreconstruction of two hands and an articulated object in interaction; (2) an\nestimation of dense hand-object relative distances, which we call interaction\nfield estimation. For the first task, we present ArcticNet, a baseline method\nfor the task of jointly reconstructing two hands and an articulated object from\nan RGB image. For interaction field estimation, we predict the relative\ndistances from each hand vertex to the object surface, and vice versa. We\nintroduce InterField, the first method that estimates such distances from a\nsingle RGB image.

Current AMT approaches are restricted to piano and\n(some) guitar recordings, due to difficult data collection. In order to\novercome data collection barriers, previous AMT approaches attempt to employ\nmusical scores in the form of a digitized version of the same song or piece.\nThe scores are typically aligned using audio features and strenuous human\nintervention to generate training labels. We introduce NoteEM, a method for\nsimultaneously training a transcriber and aligning the scores to their\ncorresponding performances, in a fully-automated process. Using this unaligned\nsupervision scheme, complemented by pseudo-labels and pitch-shift augmentation,\nour method enables training on in-the-wild recordings with unprecedented\naccuracy and instrumental variety. Using only synthetic data and unaligned\nsupervision, we report SOTA note-level accuracy of the MAPS dataset, and large\nfavorable margins on cross-dataset evaluations. We also demonstrate robustness\nand ease of use; we report comparable results when training on a small, easily\nobtainable, self-collected dataset, and we propose alternative labeling to the\nMusicNet dataset, which we show to be more accurate.

    "abstract": "Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) are highly symmetric bases on complex Hilbert\nspaces, and the corresponding rank-1 projective measurements are ubiquitous in\nquantum information theory. In this work, we study a recently introduced\ngeneralization of MUBs called mutually unbiased measurements (MUMs). These\nmeasurements inherit the essential property of complementarity from MUBs, but\nthe Hilbert space dimension is no longer required to match the number of\noutcomes. This operational complementarity property renders MUMs highly useful\nfor device-independent quantum information processing. It has been shown that\nMUMs are strictly more general than MUBs. In this work we provide a complete\nproof of the characterization of MUMs that are direct sums of MUBs. We then\nproceed to construct new examples of MUMs that are not direct sums of MUBs. A\ncrucial technical tool for these construction is a correspondence with\nquaternionic Hadamard matrices, which allows us to map known examples of such\nmatrices to MUMs that are not direct sums of MUBs. Furthermore, we show that --\nin stark contrast with MUBs -- the number of MUMs for a fixed outcome number is\nunbounded. Next, we focus on the use of MUMs in quantum communication. We\ndemonstrate how any pair of MUMs with d outcomes defines a d-dimensional\nsuperdense coding protocol. Using MUMs that are not direct sums of MUBs, we\ndisprove a recent conjecture due to Nayak and Yuen on the rigidity of\nsuperdense coding for infinitely many dimensions.",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing demand for intelligent processing on emerging\nultra-low-power internet of things (IoT) devices, and recent works have shown\nsubstantial efficiency boosts by executing inference tasks directly on the IoT\ndevice (node) rather than merely transmitting sensor data. However, the\ncomputation and power demands of Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based inference pose\nsignificant challenges for nodes in an energy-harvesting wireless sensor\nnetwork (EH-WSN). Moreover, these tasks often require responses from multiple\nphysically distributed EH sensor nodes, which imposes crucial system\noptimization challenges in addition to per-node constraints.\nTo address these challenges, we propose \\emph{Seeker}, a novel approach to\nefficiently execute DNN inferences for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) tasks,\nusing both an EH-WSN and a host mobile device. Seeker minimizes communication\noverheads and maximizes computation at each sensor without violating the\nquality of service. \\emph{Seeker} uses a \\emph{store-and-execute} approach to\ncomplete a subset of inferences on the EH sensor node, reducing communication\nwith the mobile host. Further, for those inferences unfinished because of\nharvested energy constraints, it leverages an \\emph{activity aware coreset}\n(AAC) construction to efficiently communicate compact features to the host\ndevice where ensemble techniques are used to efficiently finish the inferences.\n\\emph{Seeker} performs HAR with $86.8\\%$ accuracy, surpassing the $81.2\\%$\naccuracy of a state of the art approach.

    "abstract": "Near-term quantum computers are noisy and have limited connectivity between\nqubits. Compilers are required to introduce SWAP operations in order to perform\ntwo-qubit gates between non-adjacent qubits. SWAPs increase the number of gates\nand depth of programs, making them even more vulnerable to errors. Moreover,\nthey relocate qubits which affect SWAP selections for future gates in a\nprogram. Thus, compilers must select SWAP routes that not only minimize the\noverheads for the current operation, but also for future gates. Existing\ncompilers tend to select paths with the fewest SWAPs for the current\noperations, but do not evaluate the impact of the relocations from the selected\nSWAP candidate on future SWAPs. Also, they converge on SWAP candidates for the\ncurrent operation and only then decide SWAP routes for future gates, thus\nseverely restricting the SWAP candidate search space for future operations.\nWe propose ForeSight, a compiler that simultaneously evaluates multiple SWAP\ncandidates for several operations into the future, delays SWAP selections to\nanalyze their impact on future SWAP decisions and avoids early convergence on\nsub-optimal candidates. Moreover, ForeSight evaluates slightly longer SWAP\nroutes for current operations if they have the potential to reduce SWAPs for\nfuture gates, thus reducing SWAPs for the program globally. As compilation\nproceeds, ForeSight dynamically adds new SWAP candidates to the solution space\nand eliminates the weaker ones. This allows ForeSight to reduce SWAP overheads\nat program-level while keeping the compilation complexity tractable. Our\nevaluations with a hundred benchmarks across three devices show that ForeSight\nreduces SWAP overheads by 17% on average and 81% in the best-case, compared to\nthe baseline. ForeSight takes minutes, making it scalable to large programs.",

Multi-objective Bayesian optimisation (BO) can\nbe used to alleviate the computation time to find an approximated set of Pareto\noptimal solutions. In many real-world problems, a decision-maker has some\npreferences on the objective functions. One approach to incorporate the\npreferences in multi-objective BO is to use a scalarising function and build a\nsingle surrogate model (mono-surrogate approach) on it. This approach has two\nmajor limitations. Firstly, the fitness landscape of the scalarising function\nand the objective functions may not be similar. Secondly, the approach assumes\nthat the scalarising function distribution is Gaussian, and thus a closed-form\nexpression of an acquisition function e.g., expected improvement can be used.\nWe overcome these limitations by building independent surrogate models\n(multi-surrogate approach) on each objective function and show that the\ndistribution of the scalarising function is not Gaussian. We approximate the\ndistribution using Generalised value distribution. We present an a-priori\nmulti-surrogate approach to incorporate the desirable objective function values\n(or reference point) as the preferences of a decision-maker in multi-objective\nBO. The results and comparison with the existing mono-surrogate approach on\nbenchmark and real-world optimisation problems show the potential of the\nproposed approach.",

They are used to design signals for\ncommunications and sensing, and this paper explores how they can be used to\nprotect quantum information as it is transformed by logical gates. Given a CSS\ncode $\\mathcal{C}$, we derive conditions that are both necessary and sufficient\nfor a transversal diagonal physical operator $U_Z$ to preserve $\\mathcal{C}$\nand induce $U_L$. The group of $Z$-stabilizers in a CSS code $\\mathcal{C}$ is\ndetermined by the dual of a classical $[n, k_1]$ binary code $\\mathcal{C}_1$,\nand the group of $X$-stabilizers is determined by a classical $[n, k_2]$ binary\ncode $\\mathcal{C}_2$ that is contained in $\\mathcal{C}_1$. The requirement that\na diagonal physical operator $U_Z$ fixes a CSS code $\\mathcal{C}$ leads to\nconstraints on the congruence of weights in cosets of $\\mathcal{C}_2$. These\nconstraints are a perfect fit to divisible codes, and represent an opportunity\nto take advantage of the extensive literature on classical codes with two or\nthree weights. We construct new families of CSS codes using cosets of the first\norder Reed Muller code defined by quadratic forms. We provide a simple\nalternative to the standard method of deriving the coset weight distributions\n(based on Dickson normal form) that may be of independent interest. Finally, we\ndevelop an approach to circumventing the Eastin-Knill Theorem which states that\nno QECC can implement a universal set of logical gates through transversal\ngates alone. The essential idea is to design stabilizer codes in layers, with\n$N_1$ inner qubits and $N_2$ outer qubits, and to assemble a universal set of\nfault tolerant gates on the inner qubits.",

Researchers in this\ndomain have used transfer learning to avoid overfitting when using complex\narchitectures. However, the domain differences between pre-training and\ndownstream data hamper the performance of the downstream task. Some recent\nstudies have successfully used domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT) to address\nthis issue. In DAPT, models are initialized with the generic dataset\npre-trained weights, and further pre-training is performed using a moderately\nsized in-domain dataset (medical images). Although this technique achieved good\nresults for the downstream tasks in terms of accuracy and robustness, it is\ncomputationally expensive even when the datasets for DAPT are moderately sized.\nThese compute-intensive techniques and models impact the environment negatively\nand create an uneven playing field for researchers with limited resources. This\nstudy proposed computationally efficient DAPT without compromising the\ndownstream accuracy and robustness. This study proposes three techniques for\nthis purpose, where the first (partial DAPT) performs DAPT on a subset of\nlayers. The second one adopts a hybrid strategy (hybrid DAPT) by performing\npartial DAPT for a few epochs and then full DAPT for the remaining epochs. The\nthird technique performs DAPT on simplified variants of the base architecture.\nThe results showed that compared to the standard DAPT (full DAPT), the hybrid\nDAPT technique achieved better performance on the development and external\ndatasets.

Specifically, we propose a new hybrid encoder-decoder structure\n(called HA02) for the first time which exploits the attention mechanism to\nfocus on the most important input information. In particular, we implement a\ntransformer encoder block as the encoder to achieve the sparsity in the input\nfeatures and a residual neural network as the decoder respectively, inspired by\nthe success of the attention mechanism. Using 3GPP channel models, our\nsimulations show superior estimation performance compared with other candidate\nneural network methods for channel estimation.",

    "abstract": "Rooted acyclic graphs appear naturally when the phylogenetic relationship of\na set $X$ of taxa involves not only speciations but also recombination,\nhorizontal transfer, or hybridization, that cannot be captured by trees. A\nvariety of classes of such networks have been discussed in the literature,\nincluding phylogenetic, level-1, tree-child, tree-based, galled tree, regular,\nor normal networks as models of different types of evolutionary processes.\nClusters arise in models of phylogeny as the sets $\\mathtt{C}(v)$ of descendant\ntaxa of a vertex $v$. The clustering system $\\mathscr{C}_N$ comprising the\nclusters of a network $N$ conveys key information on $N$ itself. In the special\ncase of rooted phylogenetic trees, $T$ is uniquely determined by its clustering\nsystem $\\mathscr{C}_T$. Although this is no longer true for networks in\ngeneral, it is of interest to relate properties of $N$ and $\\mathscr{C}_N$.\nHere, we systematically investigate the relationships of several well-studied\nclasses of networks and their clustering systems. The main results are\ncorrespondences of classes of networks and clustering system of the following\nform: If $N$ is a network of type $\\mathbb{X}$, then $\\mathcal{C}_N$ satisfies\n$\\mathbb{Y}$, and conversely if $\\mathscr{C}$ is a clustering system satisfying\n$\\mathbb{Y}$ then there is network $N$ of type $\\mathbb{X}$ such that\n$\\mathscr{C}\\subseteq\\mathscr{C}_N$.This, in turn, allows us to investigate the\nmutual dependencies between the distinct types of networks in much detail.",

Firstly, we study the space of\nfeasible periodic timetables, and decompose it into polytropes, i.e., polytopes\nthat are convex both classically and in the sense of tropical geometry. We then\nstudy this decomposition and use it to outline a new heuristic for PESP, based\non the tropical neighbourhood of the polytropes. Secondly, we recognize that\nthe space of fractional cycle offsets is in fact a zonotope. We relate its\nzonotopal tilings back to the hyperrectangle of fractional periodic tensions\nand to the tropical neighbourhood of the periodic timetable space.

Nevertheless, until now, there has no successful demonstration\nof how to apply either method for generating useful physiological sensory data.\nThe state-of-the-art techniques in this context have achieved only limited\nsuccess. We present PHYSIOGAN, a generative model to produce high fidelity\nsynthetic physiological sensor data readings. PHYSIOGAN consists of an encoder,\ndecoder, and a discriminator. We evaluate PHYSIOGAN against the\nstate-of-the-art techniques using two different real-world datasets: ECG\nclassification and activity recognition from motion sensors datasets. We\ncompare PHYSIOGAN to the baseline models not only the accuracy of class\nconditional generation but also the sample diversity and sample novelty of the\nsynthetic datasets. We prove that PHYSIOGAN generates samples with higher\nutility than other generative models by showing that classification models\ntrained on only synthetic data generated by PHYSIOGAN have only 10% and 20%\ndecrease in their classification accuracy relative to classification models\ntrained on the real data.

    "abstract": "Information transfer between coupled stochastic dynamics, measured by\ntransfer entropy and information flow, is suggested as a physical process\nunderlying the causal relation of systems. While information transfer analysis\nhas booming applications in both science and engineering fields, critical\nmysteries about its foundations remain unsolved. Fundamental yet difficult\nquestions concern how information transfer and causal relation originate, what\nthey depend on, how they differ from each other, and if they are created by a\nunified and general quantity. These questions essentially determine the\nvalidity of causal relation measurement via information transfer. Here we\npursue to lay a complete theoretical basis of information transfer and causal\nrelation. Beyond the well-known relations between these concepts that\nconditionally hold, we demonstrate that information transfer and causal\nrelation universally originate from specific information synergy and redundancy\nphenomena characterized by high-order mutual information. More importantly, our\ntheory analytically explains the mechanisms for information transfer and causal\nrelation to originate, vanish, and differ from each other. Moreover, our theory\nnaturally defines the effect sizes of information transfer and causal relation\nbased on high-dimensional coupling events. These results may provide a unified\nview of information, synergy, and causal relation to bridge Pearl's causal\ninference theory in computer science and information transfer analysis in\nphysics.",

    "abstract": "We study compressive sensing with a deep generative network prior. Initial\ntheoretical guarantees for efficient recovery from compressed linear\nmeasurements have been developed for signals in the range of a ReLU network\nwith Gaussian weights and logarithmic expansivity: that is when each layer is\nlarger than the previous one by a logarithmic factor. It was later shown that\nconstant expansivity is sufficient for recovery. It has remained open whether\nthe expansivity can be relaxed allowing for networks with contractive layers,\nas often the case of real generators. In this work we answer this question,\nproving that a signal in the range of a Gaussian generative network can be\nrecovered from a few linear measurements provided that the width of the layers\nis proportional to the input layer size (up to log factors). This condition\nallows the generative network to have contractive layers. Our result is based\non showing that Gaussian matrices satisfy a matrix concentration inequality,\nwhich we term Range Restricted Weight Distribution Condition (R2WDC), and\nweakens the Weight Distribution Condition (WDC) upon which previous theoretical\nguarantees were based on. The WDC has also been used to analyze other signal\nrecovery problems with generative network priors. By replacing the WDC with the\nR2WDC, we are able to extend previous results for signal recovery with\nexpansive generative network priors to non-expansive ones.

In this work, we use a learning-theoretic perspective to study the\ntask of learning physical operations in a quantum machine when all operations\n(state preparation, dynamics, and measurement) are a priori unknown. We prove\nthat, without any prior knowledge, if one can explore the full quantum state\nspace by composing the operations, then every operation can be learned. When\none cannot explore the full state space but all operations are approximately\nknown and noise in Clifford gates is gate-independent, we find an efficient\nalgorithm for learning all operations up to a single unlearnable parameter\ncharacterizing the fidelity of the initial state. For learning a noise channel\non Clifford gates to a fixed accuracy, our algorithm uses quadratically fewer\nexperiments than previously known protocols. Under more general conditions, the\ntrue description of the noise can be unlearnable; for example, we prove that no\nbenchmarking protocol can learn gate-dependent Pauli noise on Clifford+T gates\neven under perfect state preparation and measurement. Despite not being able to\nlearn the noise, we show that a noisy quantum computer that performs entangled\nmeasurements on multiple copies of an unknown state can yield a large advantage\nin learning properties of the state compared to a noiseless device that\nmeasures individual copies and then processes the measurement data using a\nclassical computer.
