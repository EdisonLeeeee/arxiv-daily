    "title": "AI-Based Automated Speech Therapy Tools for persons with Speech Sound  Disorders: A Systematic Literature Review",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic literature review of published studies on\nAI-based automated speech therapy tools for persons with speech sound disorders\n(SSD). The COVID-19 pandemic has initiated the requirement for automated speech\ntherapy tools for persons with SSD making speech therapy accessible and\naffordable. However, there are no guidelines for designing such automated tools\nand their required degree of automation compared to human experts. In this\nsystematic review, we followed the PRISMA framework to address four research\nquestions: 1) what types of SSD do AI-based automated speech therapy tools\naddress, 2) what is the level of autonomy achieved by such tools, 3) what are\nthe different modes of intervention, and 4) how effective are such tools in\ncomparison with human experts. An extensive search was conducted on digital\nlibraries to find research papers relevant to our study from 2007 to 2022. The\nresults show that AI-based automated speech therapy tools for persons with SSD\nare increasingly gaining attention among researchers. Articulation disorders\nwere the most frequently addressed SSD based on the reviewed papers. Further,\nour analysis shows that most researchers proposed fully automated tools without\nconsidering the role of other stakeholders. Our review indicates that\nmobile-based and gamified applications were the most frequent mode of\nintervention. The results further show that only a few studies compared the\neffectiveness of such tools compared to expert Speech-Language Pathologists\n(SLP). Our paper presents the state-of-the-art in the field, contributes\nsignificant insights based on the research questions, and provides suggestions\nfor future research directions.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, the financial industry has experienced a technology\nrevolution. While we witness a rapid introduction of conversational bots for\nfinancial services, there is a lack of understanding of conversational user\ninterfaces (CUI) features in this domain. The finance industry also deals with\nhighly sensitive information and monetary transactions, presenting a challenge\nfor developers and financial providers. Through a study on how to design\ntext-based conversational financial interfaces with N=410 participants, we\noutline user requirements of trustworthy CUI design for financial bots. We\nposit that, in the context of Finance, bot privacy and security assurances\noutweigh conversational capability and postulate implications of these\nfindings.

Recent research on relation extraction showed that\nprompt-based learning improves the performance on both fine-tuning on full\ntraining set and few-shot training.

In this\npaper, we investigate prompting for biomedical relation extraction, with\nexperiments on the ChemProt dataset. We present a simple yet effective method\nto systematically generate comprehensive prompts that reformulate the relation\nextraction task as a cloze-test task under a simple prompt formulation. In\nparticular, we experiment with different ranking scores for prompt selection.\nWith BioMed-RoBERTa-base, our results show that prompting-based fine-tuning\nobtains gains by 14.21 F1 over its regular fine-tuning baseline, and 1.14 F1\nover SciFive-Large, the current state-of-the-art on ChemProt.

    "title": "Human Preferences as Dueling Bandits",
    "abstract": "The dramatic improvements in core information retrieval tasks engendered by\nneural rankers create a need for novel evaluation methods. If every ranker\nreturns highly relevant items in the top ranks, it becomes difficult to\nrecognize meaningful differences between them and to build reusable test\ncollections. Several recent papers explore pairwise preference judgments as an\nalternative to traditional graded relevance assessments. Rather than viewing\nitems one at a time, assessors view items side-by-side and indicate the one\nthat provides the better response to a query, allowing fine-grained\ndistinctions. If we employ preference judgments to identify the probably best\nitems for each query, we can measure rankers by their ability to place these\nitems as high as possible. We frame the problem of finding best items as a\ndueling bandits problem. While many papers explore dueling bandits for online\nranker evaluation via interleaving, they have not been considered as a\nframework for offline evaluation via human preference judgments. We review the\nliterature for possible solutions. For human preference judgments, any usable\nalgorithm must tolerate ties, since two items may appear nearly equal to\nassessors, and it must minimize the number of judgments required for any\nspecific pair, since each such comparison requires an independent assessor.\nSince the theoretical guarantees provided by most algorithms depend on\nassumptions that are not satisfied by human preference judgments, we simulate\nselected algorithms on representative test cases to provide insight into their\npractical utility. Based on these simulations, one algorithm stands out for its\npotential. Our simulations suggest modifications to further improve its\nperformance. Using the modified algorithm, we collect over 10,000 preference\njudgments for submissions to the TREC 2021 Deep Learning Track, confirming its\nsuitability.",

Unfortunately, although system designers can\ntheoretically adapt commodity DRAM chips to meet their particular design goals\n(e.g., by reducing access timings to improve performance, implementing\nsystem-level RowHammer mitigations), we observe that designers today lack\nsufficient insight into commodity DRAM chips' reliability characteristics to\nimplement these techniques in practice. In this work, we make a case for DRAM\nmanufacturers to provide increased transparency into key aspects of DRAM\nreliability (e.g., basic chip design properties, testing strategies). Doing so\nenables system designers to make informed decisions to better adapt commodity\nDRAM to meet modern systems' needs while preserving its cost advantages.\nTo support our argument, we study four ways that system designers can adapt\ncommodity DRAM chips to system-specific design goals: (1) improving DRAM\nreliability; (2) reducing DRAM refresh overheads; (3) reducing DRAM access\nlatency; and (4) mitigating RowHammer attacks. We observe that adopting\nsolutions for any of the four goals requires system designers to make\nassumptions about a DRAM chip's reliability characteristics. These assumptions\ndiscourage system designers from using such solutions in practice due to the\ndifficulty of both making and relying upon the assumption.\nWe identify DRAM standards as the root of the problem: current standards\nrigidly enforce a fixed operating point with no specifications for how a system\ndesigner might explore alternative operating points. To overcome this problem,\nwe introduce a two-step approach that reevaluates DRAM standards with a focus\non transparency of DRAM reliability so that system designers are encouraged to\nmake the most of commodity DRAM technology for both current and future DRAM\nchips.",

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation (MDE) aims to transform an RGB image of a scene\ninto a pixelwise depth map from the same camera view. It is fundamentally\nill-posed due to missing information: any single image can have been taken from\nmany possible 3D scenes. Part of the MDE task is, therefore, to learn which\nvisual cues in the image can be used for depth estimation, and how. With\ntraining data limited by cost of annotation or network capacity limited by\ncomputational power, this is challenging. In this work we demonstrate that\nexplicitly injecting visual cue information into the model is beneficial for\ndepth estimation. Following research into biological vision systems, we focus\non semantic information and prior knowledge of object sizes and their\nrelations, to emulate the biological cues of relative size, familiar size, and\nabsolute size. We use state-of-the-art semantic and instance segmentation\nmodels to provide external information, and exploit language embeddings to\nencode relational information between classes. We also provide a prior on the\naverage real-world size of objects. This external information overcomes the\nlimitation in data availability, and ensures that the limited capacity of a\ngiven network is focused on known-helpful cues, therefore improving\nperformance. We experimentally validate our hypothesis and evaluate the\nproposed model on the widely used NYUD2 indoor depth estimation benchmark. The\nresults show improvements in depth prediction when the semantic information,\nsize prior and instance size are explicitly provided along with the RGB images,\nand our method can be easily adapted to any depth estimation system.",

    "abstract": "Improvements in main memory storage density are primarily driven by process\ntechnology scaling, which negatively impacts reliability by exacerbating\nvarious circuit-level error mechanisms. To compensate for growing error rates,\nboth memory manufacturers and consumers use error-mitigation mechanisms that\nimprove manufacturing yield and allow system designers to meet reliability\ntargets. Developing effective error mitigations requires understanding the\nerrors' characteristics (e.g., worst-case behavior, statistical properties).\nUnfortunately, we observe that proprietary on-die Error-Correcting Codes (ECC)\nused in modern memory chips introduce new challenges to efficient error\nmitigation by obfuscating CPU-visible error characteristics in an\nunpredictable, ECC-dependent manner.\nThis dissertation builds a detailed understanding of how on-die ECC\nobfuscates the statistical properties of main memory error mechanisms using a\ncombination of real-chip experiments and statistical analyses. We\nexperimentally study memory errors, examine how on-die ECC obfuscates their\nstatistical characteristics, and develop new testing techniques to overcome the\nobfuscation. Our results show that the obfuscated error characteristics can be\nrecovered using new memory testing techniques that exploit the interaction\nbetween on-die ECC and the statistical characteristics of memory error\nmechanisms to expose physical cell behavior. We conclude by discussing the\ncritical need for transparency in DRAM reliability characteristics in order to\nenable DRAM consumers to better understand and adapt commodity DRAM chips to\ntheir system-specific needs. We hope and believe that the analysis, techniques,\nand results we present in this dissertation will enable the community to better\nunderstand and tackle current and future reliability challenges as well as\nadapt commodity memory to new advantageous applications.",

In this case, standard stochastic interpolation tools\nlike the common SABR model often cannot be calibrated to observed implied\nvolatility smiles, due to data being only available for the at-the-money quote\nof the respective underlying swaption. Here, we propose to infer the geometry\nof the full unknown implied volatility cube by learning stochastic latent\nrepresentations of implied volatility cubes via variational autoencoders,\nenabling inference about the missing volatility data conditional on the\nobserved data by an approximate Gibbs sampling approach. Imputed estimates of\nmissing quotes can afterwards be used to fit a standard stochastic volatility\nmodel. Since training data for the employed variational autoencoder model is\nusually sparsely available, we test the robustness of the approach for a model\ntrained on synthetic data on real market quotes and we show that SABR\ninterpolated volatilites calibrated to reconstructed volatility cubes with\nartificially imputed missing values differ by not much more than two basis\npoints compared to SABR fits calibrated to the complete cube.

    "abstract": "Finding small vertex covers in a graph has applications in numerous domains.\nTwo common formulations of the problem include: Minimum Vertex Cover, which\nfinds the smallest vertex cover in a graph, and Parameterized Vertex Cover,\nwhich finds a vertex cover whose size is less than or equal to some parameter\n$k$. Algorithms for both formulations traverse a search tree, which grows\nexponentially with the size of the graph or the value of $k$.\nParallelizing the traversal of the vertex cover search tree on GPUs is\nchallenging for multiple reasons. First, the search tree is a narrow binary\ntree which makes it difficult to extract enough sub-trees to process in\nparallel to fully utilize the GPU's resources. Second, the search tree is\nhighly imbalanced which makes load balancing across a massive number of\nparallel GPU workers challenging. Third, keeping around all the intermediate\nstate needed to traverse many sub-trees in parallel puts high pressure on the\nGPU's memory resources and may act as a limiting factor to parallelism.\nTo address these challenges, we propose an approach to traverse the vertex\ncover search tree in parallel using GPUs while handling dynamic load balancing.\nEach thread block traverses a different sub-tree using a local stack, however,\nwe also use a global worklist to balance load. Blocks contribute branches of\ntheir sub-trees to the global worklist on an as-needed basis, while blocks that\nfinish their sub-trees get new ones from the global worklist. We use degree\narrays to represent intermediate graphs so that the representation is compact\nin memory to avoid limiting parallelism, but self-contained which is necessary\nfor load balancing. Our evaluation shows that compared to prior work, our\nhybrid approach of using local stacks and a global worklist substantially\nimproves performance and reduces load imbalance, especially on difficult\ninstances of the problem.",

The manifolds need not be\ncharacterized by an atlas or by the zeros of a smooth map. Instead, they can be\ndefined by point-clouds and sampled as needed through an iterative process. If\nthe manifold is an Euclidean space, our method follows isoclines, curves along\nwhich the direction of the vector field $X$ is constant. For a generic vector\nfield $X$, isoclines are smooth curves and every equilibrium is a limit point\nof isoclines. We generalize the definition of isoclines to Riemannian manifolds\nthrough the use of parallel transport: generalized isoclines are curves along\nwhich the directions of $X$ are parallel transports of each other. As in the\nEuclidean case, generalized isoclines of generic vector fields $X$ are smooth\ncurves that connect equilibria of $X$.\nOur work is motivated by computational statistical mechanics, specifically\nhigh dimensional (stochastic) differential equations that model the dynamics of\nmolecular systems. Often, these dynamics concentrate near low-dimensional\nmanifolds and have transitions (sadddle points with a single unstable\ndirection) between metastable equilibria We employ iteratively sampled data and\nisoclines to locate these saddle points.

In this paper, we present a probabilistic top-down approach to\nhierarchical forecasting that uses a novel attention-based RNN model to learn\nthe distribution of the proportions according to which each parent prediction\nis split among its children nodes at any point in time. These probabilistic\nproportions are then coupled with an independent univariate probabilistic\nforecasting model (such as Prophet or STS) for the root time series. The\nresulting forecasts are computed in a top-down fashion and are naturally\ncoherent, and also support probabilistic predictions over all time series in\nthe hierarchy. We provide theoretical justification for the superiority of our\ntop-down approach compared to traditional bottom-up hierarchical modeling.\nFinally, we experiment on three public datasets and demonstrate significantly\nimproved probabilistic forecasts, compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic\nhierarchical models.",

To gain such insights, we have in previous work proposed the\ncrowdsourcing platform SimRa, which allows cyclists to record their rides and\nreport near miss incidents via a smartphone app. In this paper, we present\nCycleSense, a combination of signal processing and Machine Learning techniques,\nwhich partially automates the detection of near miss incidents.

    "abstract": "Sequential modelling of high-dimensional data is an important problem that\nappears in many domains including model-based reinforcement learning and\ndynamics identification for control. Latent variable models applied to\nsequential data (i.e., latent dynamics models) have been shown to be a\nparticularly effective probabilistic approach to solve this problem, especially\nwhen dealing with images. However, in many application areas (e.g., robotics),\ninformation from multiple sensing modalities is available -- existing latent\ndynamics methods have not yet been extended to effectively make use of such\nmultimodal sequential data. Multimodal sensor streams can be correlated in a\nuseful manner and often contain complementary information across modalities. In\nthis work, we present a self-supervised generative modelling framework to\njointly learn a probabilistic latent state representation of multimodal data\nand the respective dynamics. Using synthetic and real-world datasets from a\nmultimodal robotic planar pushing task, we demonstrate that our approach leads\nto significant improvements in prediction and representation quality.\nFurthermore, we compare to the common learning baseline of concatenating each\nmodality in the latent space and show that our principled probabilistic\nformulation performs better. Finally, despite being fully self-supervised, we\ndemonstrate that our method is nearly as effective as an existing supervised\napproach that relies on ground truth labels.",

The main idea behind our approach, Policy-Guided Planning for\nGeneralized Policy Generation (PG3), is that a candidate policy should be used\nto guide planning on training problems as a mechanism for evaluating that\ncandidate. Theoretical results in a simplified setting give conditions under\nwhich PG3 is optimal or admissible. We then study a specific instantiation of\npolicy search where planning problems are PDDL-based and policies are lifted\ndecision lists.

    "abstract": "A turbocharger plays an essential part in reducing emissions and increasing\nthe fuel efficiency of road vehicles. The pulsating flow of exhaust gases,\nalong with high heat exchange from the turbocharger casing, makes developing\ncontrol-oriented models difficult. Several researchers have used maps provided\nby manufacturers to solve this problem. These maps often fail to incorporate\nany heat transfer effects and are unsuitable for wide operating regions. Also,\nwith the availability of more and better sensor data, there is a need for a\nmethod that can exploit this to obtain a better predictive model. Koopman\napproaches rely on the observation that one can lift the nonlinear dynamics of\nthe turbine into an infinite-dimensional function space over which dynamics are\nlinear. The objective of this paper is to develop a model to predict the\ntransient and steady-state behavior of the turbine using the Koopman operator\nwhich can be helpful for control design and analysis. Our approach is as\nfollows. We use experimental data from a Cummins heavy-duty diesel engine to\ndevelop a turbine model using Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition, which\napproximates the action of the Koopman operator on a finite-dimensional\nsubspace of the space of observables. The results demonstrate superior\nperformance compared to a tuned nonlinear autoregressive network with an\nexogenous input model widely used in the literature.

    "abstract": "During a pandemic people have to find a trade-off between meeting others and\nstaying safely at home. While meeting others is pleasant, it also increases the\nrisk of infection. We consider this dilemma by introducing a game-theoretic\nnetwork creation model in which selfish agents can form bilateral connections.\nThey benefit from network neighbors, but at the same time, they want to\nmaximize their distance to all other agents. This models the inherent conflict\nthat social distancing rules impose on the behavior of selfish agents in a\nsocial network. Besides addressing this familiar issue, our model can be seen\nas the inverse to the well-studied Network Creation Game by Fabrikant et al.\n[PODC 2003] where agents aim at being as central as possible in the created\nnetwork. Thus, our work is in-line with studies that compare minimization\nproblems with their maximization versions.\nWe look at two variants of network creation governed by social distancing. In\nthe first variant, there are no restrictions on the connections being formed.\nWe characterize optimal and equilibrium networks, and we derive asymptotically\ntight bounds on the Price of Anarchy and Price of Stability. The second variant\nis the model's generalization that allows restrictions on the connections that\ncan be formed. As our main result, we prove that Swap-Maximal Routing-Cost\nSpanning Trees, an efficiently computable weaker variant of Maximum\nRouting-Cost Spanning Trees, actually resemble equilibria for a significant\nrange of the parameter space. Moreover, we give almost tight bounds on the\nPrice of Anarchy and Price of Stability. These results imply that, compared the\nwell-studied inverse models, under social distancing the agents' selfish\nbehavior has a significantly stronger impact on the quality of the equilibria,\ni.e., allowing socially much worse stable states.",

Despite significant recent efforts in this area, most prior\nworks are focused on specific data types (e.g., image or audio), and they\nignore the goal and effectiveness aspects of semantic transmissions. In\ncontrast, in this paper, a holistic goal-oriented semantic communication\nframework is proposed to enable a speaker and a listener to cooperatively\nexecute a set of sequential tasks in a dynamic environment. A common language\nbased on a hierarchical belief set is proposed to enable semantic\ncommunications between speaker and listener. The speaker, acting as an observer\nof the environment, utilizes the beliefs to transmit an initial description of\nits observation (called event) to the listener. The listener is then able to\ninfer on the transmitted description and complete it by adding related beliefs\nto the transmitted beliefs of the speaker. As such, the listener reconstructs\nthe observed event based on the completed description, and it then takes\nappropriate action in the environment based on the reconstructed event. An\noptimization problem is defined to determine the perfect and abstract\ndescription of the events while minimizing the transmission and inference costs\nwith constraints on the task execution time and belief efficiency. Then, a\nnovel bottom-up curriculum learning (CL) framework based on reinforcement\nlearning is proposed to solve the optimization problem and enable the speaker\nand listener to gradually identify the structure of the belief set and the\nperfect and abstract description of the events. Simulation results show that\nthe proposed CL method outperforms traditional RL in terms of convergence time,\ntask execution cost and time, reliability, and belief efficiency.",

While mature\nrepresentation learning methods exist in computer vision and natural language\nprocessing, these pre-training methods require large-scale data. It is hard to\nreplicate these approaches in trajectory forecasting due to the lack of\nadequate trajectory data (e.g., 34K samples in the nuScenes dataset).

    "abstract": "Modern computer systems need to execute under strict safety constraints\n(e.g., a power limit), but doing so often conflicts with their ability to\ndeliver high performance (i.e. minimal latency). Prior work uses machine\nlearning to automatically tune hardware resources such that the system\nexecution meets safety constraints optimally. Such solutions monitor past\nsystem executions to learn the system's behavior under different hardware\nresource allocations before dynamically tuning resources to optimize the\napplication execution. However, system behavior can change significantly\nbetween different applications and even different inputs of the same\napplications. Hence, the models learned using data collected a priori are often\nsuboptimal and violate safety constraints when used with new applications and\ninputs. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of an execution\nspace, which is the cross product of hardware resources, input features, and\napplications. To dynamically and safely allocate hardware resources from the\nexecution space, we present SCOPE, a resource manager that leverages a novel\nsafe exploration framework. We evaluate SCOPE's ability to deliver improved\nlatency while minimizing power constraint violations by dynamically configuring\nhardware while running a variety of Apache Spark applications. Compared to\nprior approaches that minimize power constraint violations, SCOPE consumes\ncomparable power while improving latency by up to 9.5X.

    "abstract": "Traditional dynamic models of continuum robots are in general computationally\nexpensive and not suitable for real-time control. Recent approaches using\nlearning-based methods to approximate the dynamic model of continuum robots for\ncontrol have been promising, although real data hungry -- which may cause\npotential damage to robots and be time consuming -- and getting poorer\nperformance when trained with simulation data only. This paper presents a\nmodel-based learning framework for continuum robot closed-loop control that, by\ncombining simulation and real data, shows to require only 100 real data to\noutperform a real-data-only controller trained using up to 10000 points. The\nintroduced data-efficient framework with three control policies has utilized a\nGaussian process regression (GPR) and a recurrent neural network (RNN). Control\npolicy A uses a GPR model and a RNN trained in simulation to optimize control\noutputs for simulated targets; control policy B retrains the RNN in policy A\nwith data generated from the GPR model to adapt to real robot physics; control\npolicy C utilizes policy A and B to form a hybrid policy. Using a continuum\nrobot with soft spines, we show that our approach provides an efficient\nframework to bridge the sim-to-real gap in model-based learning for continuum\nrobots.",

    "title": "Optimal Heap Limits for Reducing Browser Memory Use",
    "abstract": "Garbage collected language runtimes must carefully tune heap limits to reduce\ngarbage collection time and memory usage. However, there's a trade-off: a lower\nheap limit reduces memory use but increases garbage collection time. Classic\nmethods for setting heap limits include manually-tuned heap limits and\nmultiple-of-working-memory rules of thumb. But because it's a trade-off, it's\nnot clear what heap limit rule is best or how even to compare them.\nWe address this problem with a new framework where heap limits are set for\nmultiple heaps at once. In this framework, standard heap limit rules are\nnon-compositional: multiple heaps using the same heap limit rule allocate\nmemory in non-Pareto-optimal ways. We use our framework to derive a\ncompositional \"square-root\" heap limit rule, which achieves minimizes total\nmemory usage for any amount of total garbage collection time. Paradoxically,\nthe square-root heap limit rule achieves coordination without communication: it\nallocates memory optimally across multiple heaps without requiring any\ncommunication between heaps.\nTo demonstrate that this heap limit rule is effective, we prototype it for\nV8, the JavaScript runtime used in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and other\nbrowsers, as well as in server-side frameworks like node.js and Deno. On\nreal-world web pages, our prototype achieves reductions of approximately 16.99%\nof memory usage. On memory-intensive benchmarks, reductions of up to 6.55% of\ngarbage collection time are possible with no change in total memory usage.",

    "abstract": "Historically lower-level tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and\nspeaker identification are the main focus in the speech field. Interest has\nbeen growing in higher-level spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks\nrecently, like sentiment analysis (SA). However, improving performances on SLU\ntasks remains a big challenge. Basically, there are two main methods for SLU\ntasks: (1) Two-stage method, which uses a speech model to transfer speech to\ntext, then uses a language model to get the results of downstream tasks; (2)\nOne-stage method, which just fine-tunes a pre-trained speech model to fit in\nthe downstream tasks. The first method loses emotional cues such as intonation,\nand causes recognition errors during ASR process, and the second one lacks\nnecessary language knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Wave BERT (WaBERT),\na novel end-to-end model combining the speech model and the language model for\nSLU tasks. WaBERT is based on the pre-trained speech and language model, hence\ntraining from scratch is not needed. We also set most parameters of WaBERT\nfrozen during training. By introducing WaBERT, audio-specific information and\nlanguage knowledge are integrated in the short-time and low-resource training\nprocess to improve results on the dev dataset of SLUE SA tasks by 1.15% of\nrecall score and 0.82% of F1 score. Additionally, we modify the serial\nContinuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) mechanism to achieve the monotonic\nalignment between the speech and text modalities.",

In relief distribution, the main goal is to deliver all\nthe supplies to those that are in need in the fastest way possible. In this\npaper, we present different optimization solutions for relief distribution.

We match the number of supplies to the number of\ndemands for each distribution center based on the distribution of demands.

One potential solution is to use measurements of\ngravity as an aiding source. The measurements are matched to a geo-referenced\nmap of Earth's gravity in order to estimate the vehicle's position. In this\npaper, we propose a novel formulation of the map matching problem using a\nhidden Markov model (HMM).

    "abstract": "Cross-modal encoders for vision-language (VL) tasks are often pretrained with\ncarefully curated vision-language datasets. While these datasets reach an order\nof 10 million samples, the labor cost is prohibitive to scale further.\nConversely, unimodal encoders are pretrained with simpler annotations that are\nless cost-prohibitive, achieving scales of hundreds of millions to billions. As\na result, unimodal encoders have achieved state-of-art (SOTA) on many\ndownstream tasks. However, challenges remain when applying to VL tasks. The\npretraining data is not optimal for cross-modal architectures and requires\nheavy computational resources. In addition, unimodal architectures lack\ncross-modal interactions that have demonstrated significant benefits for VL\ntasks. Therefore, how to best leverage pretrained unimodal encoders for VL\ntasks is still an area of active research. In this work, we propose a method to\nleverage unimodal vision and text encoders for VL tasks that augment existing\nVL approaches while conserving computational complexity. Specifically, we\npropose Multimodal Adaptive Distillation (MAD), which adaptively distills\nuseful knowledge from pretrained encoders to cross-modal VL encoders. Second,\nto better capture nuanced impacts on VL task performance, we introduce an\nevaluation protocol that includes Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), Visual\nEntailment (SNLI-VE), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), across a variety of\ndata constraints and conditions of domain shift. Experiments demonstrate that\nMAD leads to consistent gains in the low-shot, domain-shifted, and\nfully-supervised conditions on VCR, SNLI-VE, and VQA, achieving SOTA\nperformance on VCR compared to other single models pretrained with image-text\ndata. Finally, MAD outperforms concurrent works utilizing pretrained vision\nencoder from CLIP. Code will be made available.",

However, the collection of a wide variety\nof visual experiences in everyday navigation is costly and prohibitive for\nreal-time robotic applications. We address this issue by employing a novel {\\it\ndomain-invariant} NBV planner. A standard VPR subsystem based on a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) is assumed to be available, and its\ndomain-invariant state recognition ability is proposed to be transferred to\ntrain the domain-invariant NBV planner. Specifically, we divide the visual cues\nthat are available from the CNN model into two types: the output layer cue\n(OLC) and intermediate layer cue (ILC). The OLC is available at the output\nlayer of the CNN model and aims to estimate the state of the robot (e.g., the\nrobot viewpoint) with respect to the world-centric view coordinate system. The\nILC is available within the middle layers of the CNN model as a high-level\ndescription of the visual content (e.g., a saliency image) with respect to the\nego-centric view. In our framework, the ILC and OLC are mapped to a state\nvector and subsequently used to train a multiview NBV planner via deep\nreinforcement learning.

The presence of such various licenses imposes challenges to\nunderstanding licenses and their compatibility. To avoid financial and legal\nrisks, it is essential to ensure license compatibility when integrating\nthird-party packages or reusing code accompanied with licenses. In this work,\nwe propose LiDetector, an effective tool that extracts and interprets OSS\nlicenses (including both official licenses and custom licenses), and detects\nlicense incompatibility among these licenses. Specifically, LiDetector\nintroduces a learning-based method to automatically identify meaningful license\nterms from an arbitrary license and employs Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar\n(PCFG) to infer rights and obligations for incompatibility detection.\nExperiments demonstrate that LiDetector outperforms existing methods with\n93.28% precision for term identification, and 91.09% accuracy for right and\nobligation inference, and can effectively detect incompatibility with a 10.06%\nFP rate and 2.56% FN rate.

This movement of data involves\ntime-consuming formalities like complying with HIPAA, GDPR, etc.There is also a\nrisk of patients' private data getting leaked, compromising their\nconfidentiality.

This paper presents an investigation on the relation\nbetween the two scoring approaches, aiming to explain the above\ncounter-intuitive observation. It is shown that the cosine scoring is\nessentially a special case of PLDA scoring. In other words, by properly setting\nthe parameters of PLDA, the two back-ends become equivalent. As a consequence,\nthe cosine scoring not only inherits the basic assumptions for the PLDA but\nalso introduces additional assumptions on the properties of input embeddings.\nExperiments show that the dimensional independence assumption required by the\ncosine scoring contributes most to the performance gap between the two methods\nunder the domain-matched condition. When there is severe domain mismatch and\nthe dimensional independence assumption does not hold, the PLDA would perform\nbetter than the cosine for domain adaptation.",

In this paper, we analyze\nthe IoU imbalance that is caused by the relatively high number of low-quality\nregion proposals, and reveal that it plays a critical role in improving\nfew-shot learning capabilities. The well-known two stage fine-tuning technique\ncauses insufficient quality and quantity of the novel positive samples, which\nhinders the effective object detection of unseen novel classes. To alleviate\nthis issue, we present a few-shot object detection model with proposal balance\nrefinement, a simple yet effective approach in learning object proposals using\nan auxiliary sequential bounding box refinement process. This process enables\nthe detector to be optimized on the various IoU scores through additional novel\nclass samples. To fully exploit our sequential stage architecture, we revise\nthe fine-tuning strategy and expose the Region Proposal Network to the novel\nclasses in order to provide increased learning opportunities for the\nregion-of-interest (RoI) classifiers and regressors. Our extensive assessments\non PASCAL VOC and COCO demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms\nother existing few-shot object detection approaches.",

    "title": "Exploring Hidden Semantics in Neural Networks with Symbolic Regression",
    "abstract": "Many recent studies focus on developing mechanisms to explain the black-box\nbehaviors of neural networks (NNs). However, little work has been done to\nextract the potential hidden semantics (mathematical representation) of a\nneural network. A succinct and explicit mathematical representation of a NN\nmodel could improve the understanding and interpretation of its behaviors. To\naddress this need, we propose a novel symbolic regression method for neural\nworks (called SRNet) to discover the mathematical expressions of a NN. SRNet\ncreates a Cartesian genetic programming (NNCGP) to represent the hidden\nsemantics of a single layer in a NN. It then leverages a multi-chromosome NNCGP\nto represent hidden semantics of all layers of the NN. The method uses a\n(1+$\\lambda$) evolutionary strategy (called MNNCGP-ES) to extract the final\nmathematical expressions of all layers in the NN. Experiments on 12 symbolic\nregression benchmarks and 5 classification benchmarks show that SRNet not only\ncan reveal the complex relationships between each layer of a NN but also can\nextract the mathematical representation of the whole NN. Compared with LIME and\nMAPLE, SRNet has higher interpolation accuracy and trends to approximate the\nreal model on the practical dataset.",

Motivated by this, we propose ConFiT, a fine-tuning\nmethod incorporating two components, cross-convolution batch normalization\n(Xconv BN) and hierarchical fine-tuning. Xconv BN maintains pre-convolution\nrunning means instead of post-convolution, and recovers post-convolution ones\nbefore testing, which corrects the inaccurate estimates of means under IRS.\nHierarchical fine-tuning leverages a multi-stage strategy to fine-tune the\npre-trained network, preventing massive changes in Conv layers and thus\nalleviating IRS.

The predominance of this setup in\nconversation response ranking has lead to a great deal of attention to building\nneural re-rankers, while the first-stage retrieval step has been overlooked.\nSince the correct answer is always available in the candidate list of $n$\nresponses, this artificial evaluation setup assumes that there is a first-stage\nretrieval step which is always able to rank the correct response in its top-$n$\nlist. In this paper we focus on the more realistic task of full-rank retrieval\nof responses, where $n$ can be up to millions of responses. We investigate both\ndialogue context and response expansion techniques for sparse retrieval, as\nwell as zero-shot and fine-tuned dense retrieval approaches. Our findings based\non three different information-seeking dialogue datasets reveal that a learned\nresponse expansion technique is a solid baseline for sparse retrieval. We find\nthe best performing method overall to be dense retrieval with intermediate\ntraining, i.e. a step after the language model pre-training where sentence\nrepresentations are learned, followed by fine-tuning on the target\nconversational data. We also investigate the intriguing phenomena that harder\nnegatives sampling techniques lead to worse results for the fine-tuned dense\nretrieval models.

    "title": "Efficient Pipeline Planning for Expedited Distributed DNN Training",
    "abstract": "To train modern large DNN models, pipeline parallelism has recently emerged,\nwhich distributes the model across GPUs and enables different devices to\nprocess different microbatches in pipeline. Earlier pipeline designs allow\nmultiple versions of model parameters to co-exist (similar to asynchronous\ntraining), and cannot ensure the same model convergence and accuracy\nperformance as without pipelining. Synchronous pipelining has recently been\nproposed which ensures model performance by enforcing a synchronization barrier\nbetween training iterations. Nonetheless, the synchronization barrier requires\nwaiting for gradient aggregation from all microbatches and thus delays the\ntraining progress. Optimized pipeline planning is needed to minimize such wait\nand hence the training time, which has not been well studied in the literature.\nThis paper designs efficient, near-optimal algorithms for expediting\nsynchronous pipeline-parallel training of modern large DNNs over arbitrary\ninter-GPU connectivity. Our algorithm framework comprises two components: a\npipeline partition and device mapping algorithm, and a pipeline scheduler that\ndecides processing order of microbatches over the partitions, which together\nminimize the per-iteration training time. We conduct thorough theoretical\nanalysis, extensive testbed experiments and trace-driven simulation, and\ndemonstrate our scheme can accelerate training up to 157% compared with\nstate-of-the-art designs.",

    "abstract": "Audio-based classification techniques on body sounds have long been studied\nto support diagnostic decisions, particularly in pulmonary diseases. In\nresponse to the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing number of models\nare developed to identify COVID-19 patients based on acoustic input. Most\nmodels focus on cough because the dry cough is the best-known symptom of\nCOVID-19. However, other body sounds, such as breath and speech, have also been\nrevealed to correlate with COVID-19 as well. In this work, rather than relying\non a specific body sound, we propose Fused Audio Instance and Representation\nfor COVID-19 Detection (FAIR4Cov). It relies on constructing a joint feature\nvector obtained from a plurality of body sounds in waveform and spectrogram\nrepresentation. The core component of FAIR4Cov is a self-attention fusion unit\nthat is trained to establish the relation of multiple body sounds and audio\nrepresentations and integrate it into a compact feature vector. We set up our\nexperiments on different combinations of body sounds using only waveform,\nspectrogram, and a joint representation of waveform and spectrogram. Our\nfindings show that the use of self-attention to combine extracted features from\ncough, breath, and speech sounds leads to the best performance with an Area\nUnder the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) score of 0.8658, a\nsensitivity of 0.8057, and a specificity of 0.7958. This AUC is 0.0227 higher\nthan the one of the models trained on spectrograms only and 0.0847 higher than\nthe one of the models trained on waveforms only. The results demonstrate that\nthe combination of spectrogram with waveform representation helps to enrich the\nextracted features and outperforms the models with single representation.",

In this context, a key problem is non-uniform chase termination:\ndoes the chase of a database w.r.t. a rule-based ontology terminate? And if\nthis is the case, what is the size of the result of the chase? We focus on\nguarded tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs), which form a robust rule-based\nontology language, and study the above central questions for the semi-oblivious\nversion of the chase. One of our main findings is that non-uniform\nsemi-oblivious chase termination for guarded TGDs is feasible in polynomial\ntime w.r.t. the database, and the size of the result of the chase (whenever is\nfinite) is linear w.r.t. the database.

An advantage of our algebraic treatment is\nthat the category of $R$-modules is locally presentable, from which it easily\nfollows that this category becomes a model of intuitionistic linear logic with\nthe cofree exponential.

    "abstract": "Operational consistent query answering (CQA) is a recent framework for CQA,\nbased on revised definitions of repairs and consistent answers, which opens up\nthe possibility of efficient approximations with explicit error guarantees. The\nmain idea is to iteratively apply operations (e.g., fact deletions), starting\nfrom an inconsistent database, until we reach a database that is consistent\nw.r.t. the given set of constraints. This gives us the flexibility of choosing\nthe probability with which we apply an operation, which in turn allows us to\ncalculate the probability of an operational repair, and thus, the probability\nwith which a consistent answer is entailed. A natural way of assigning\nprobabilities to operations is by targeting the uniform probability\ndistribution over a reasonable space such as the set of operational repairs,\nthe set of sequences of operations that lead to an operational repair, and the\nset of available operations at a certain step of the repairing process. This\nleads to what we generally call uniform operational CQA. The goal of this work\nis to perform a data complexity analysis of both exact and approximate uniform\noperational CQA, focusing on functional dependencies (and subclasses thereof),\nand conjunctive queries. The main outcome of our analysis (among other positive\nand negative results), is that uniform operational CQA pushes the efficiency\nboundaries further by ensuring the existence of efficient approximation schemes\nin scenarios that go beyond the simple case of primary keys, which seems to be\nthe limit of the classical approach to CQA.",

To achieve this, we\ntrain a neural network to capture the on-surface prior to determine whether a\npoint is on a sparse point cloud or not, and then leverage it as a\ndifferentiable function to learn SDFs from unseen sparse point cloud. Our\nmethod can learn SDFs from a single sparse point cloud without ground truth\nsigned distances or point normals. Our numerical evaluation under widely used\nbenchmarks demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nreconstruction accuracy, especially for sparse point clouds.",

    "abstract": "Transferable adversarial attack has drawn increasing attention due to their\npractical threaten to real-world applications. In particular, the feature-level\nadversarial attack is one recent branch that can enhance the transferability\nvia disturbing the intermediate features. The existing methods usually create a\nguidance map for features, where the value indicates the importance of the\ncorresponding feature element and then employs an iterative algorithm to\ndisrupt the features accordingly. However, the guidance map is fixed in\nexisting methods, which can not consistently reflect the behavior of networks\nas the image is changed during iteration. In this paper, we describe a new\nmethod called Feature-Momentum Adversarial Attack (FMAA) to further improve\ntransferability. The key idea of our method is that we estimate a guidance map\ndynamically at each iteration using momentum to effectively disturb the\ncategory-relevant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on\ndifferent target models.",

Most existing FSS methods implement such\nsupport-query interactions by solely leveraging plain operations - e.g., cosine\nsimilarity and feature concatenation - for segmenting the query objects.\nHowever, these interaction approaches usually cannot well capture the intrinsic\nobject details in the query images that are widely encountered in FSS, e.g., if\nthe query object to be segmented has holes and slots, inaccurate segmentation\nalmost always happens. To this end, we propose a dynamic prototype convolution\nnetwork (DPCN) to fully capture the aforementioned intrinsic details for\naccurate FSS. Specifically, in DPCN, a dynamic convolution module (DCM) is\nfirstly proposed to generate dynamic kernels from support foreground, then\ninformation interaction is achieved by convolution operations over query\nfeatures using these kernels. Moreover, we equip DPCN with a support activation\nmodule (SAM) and a feature filtering module (FFM) to generate pseudo mask and\nfilter out background information for the query images, respectively. SAM and\nFFM together can mine enriched context information from the query features. Our\nDPCN is also flexible and efficient under the k-shot FSS setting.

Some recent studies have shown that\nautoencoder-based language models are able to boost the dense retrieval\nperformance using a weak decoder. However, we argue that 1) it is not\ndiscriminative to decode all the input texts and, 2) even a weak decoder has\nthe bypass effect on the encoder. Therefore, in this work, we introduce a novel\ncontrastive span prediction task to pre-train the encoder alone, but still\nretain the bottleneck ability of the autoencoder. % Therefore, in this work, we\npropose to drop out the decoder and introduce a novel contrastive span\nprediction task to pre-train the encoder alone. The key idea is to force the\nencoder to generate the text representation close to its own random spans while\nfar away from others using a group-wise contrastive loss. In this way, we can\n1) learn discriminative text representations efficiently with the group-wise\ncontrastive learning over spans and, 2) avoid the bypass effect of the decoder\nthoroughly.

    "abstract": "Exposure errors in an image cause a degradation in the contrast and low\nvisibility in the content. In this paper, we address this problem and propose\nan end-to-end exposure correction model in order to handle both under- and\noverexposure errors with a single model. Our model contains an image encoder,\nconsecutive residual blocks, and image decoder to synthesize the corrected\nimage. We utilize perceptual loss, feature matching loss, and multi-scale\ndiscriminator to increase the quality of the generated image as well as to make\nthe training more stable. The experimental results indicate the effectiveness\nof proposed model. We achieve the state-of-the-art result on a large-scale\nexposure dataset. Besides, we investigate the effect of exposure setting of the\nimage on the portrait matting task. We find that under- and overexposed images\ncause severe degradation in the performance of the portrait matting models.

Popularity in the field of\nBCIs has increased in recent years with the development of several\nconsumer-grade EEG devices that can detect human cognitive states in real-time\nand deliver feedback to enhance human performance. Several studies are\nconducted to understand the fundamentals and essential aspects of EEG in BCIs.\nHowever, the significant issue of how can consumer-grade EEG devices be used to\ncontrol mechatronic systems effectively has been given less attention. In this\npaper, we have designed and implemented an EEG BCI system using the OpenBCI\nCyton headset and a user interface running a game. We employ real-world\nparticipants to play a game to gather training data that was later put into\nmultiple machine learning models, including a linear discriminant analysis\n(LDA), k-nearest neighbours (KNN), and a convolutional neural network (CNN).\nAfter training the machine learning models, a validation phase of the\nexperiment took place where participants tried to play the same game but\nwithout direct control, utilising the outputs of the machine learning models to\ndetermine how the game moved. We find that a CNN trained to the specific user\nplaying the game performed with the highest activation accuracy from the\nmachine learning models tested, allowing for future implementation with a\nmechatronic system.",

    "title": "Risk Awareness in HTN Planning",
    "abstract": "Actual real-world domains are characterised by uncertain situations in which\nacting and use of resources require embracing risk. Performing actions in such\ndomains always entails costs of consuming some resource, such as time, money,\nor energy, where the knowledge about these costs can range from totally known\nto totally unknown and even unknowable probabilities of costs. Think of robotic\ndomains, where actions and their costs are non-deterministic due to uncertain\nfactors like obstacles. Choosing which action to perform considering its cost\non the available resource requires taking a stance on risk. Thus, these domains\ncall for not only planning under uncertainty but also planning while embracing\nrisk. Taking Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning as a widely used planning\ntechnique in real-world applications, one can observe that existing approaches\ndo not account for risk. That is, computing most probable or optimal plans\nusing actions with single-valued costs is only enough to express risk\nneutrality. In this work, we postulate that HTN planning can become risk aware\nby considering expected utility theory, a representative concept of decision\ntheory that enables choosing actions considering a probability distribution of\ntheir costs and a given risk attitude expressed using a utility function. In\nparticular, we introduce a general framework for HTN planning that allows\nmodelling risk and uncertainty using a probability distribution of action costs\nupon which we define risk-aware HTN planning as an approach that accounts for\nthe different risk attitudes and allows computing plans that go beyond risk\nneutrality. In fact, we layout that computing risk-aware plans requires finding\nplans with the highest expected utility. Finally, we argue that it is possible\nfor HTN planning agents to solve specialised risk-aware HTN planning problems\nby adapting some existing HTN planning approaches.",

    "abstract": "Self-Attention is a widely used building block in neural modeling to mix\nlong-range data elements. Most self-attention neural networks employ pairwise\ndot-products to specify the attention coefficients. However, these methods\nrequire $O(N^2)$ computing cost for sequence length $N$. Even though some\napproximation methods have been introduced to relieve the quadratic cost, the\nperformance of the dot-product approach is still bottlenecked by the low-rank\nconstraint in the attention matrix factorization. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel scalable and effective mixing building block called Paramixer. Our method\nfactorizes the interaction matrix into several sparse matrices, where we\nparameterize the non-zero entries by MLPs with the data elements as input. The\noverall computing cost of the new building block is as low as $O(N \\log N)$.\nMoreover, all factorizing matrices in Paramixer are full-rank, so it does not\nsuffer from the low-rank bottleneck. We have tested the new method on both\nsynthetic and various real-world long sequential data sets and compared it with\nseveral state-of-the-art attention networks.

Our main result is that\nthis graph searching variant is monotone in the sense that the number of\nsearchers required for a successful search strategy does not increase if we\nrestrict the search strategies to those that do not permit the fugitive to\nvisit an already clean edge. This means that mixed search strategies against an\nagile and visible fugitive can be polynomially certified, and therefore that\nthe problem of deciding, given a graph $G$ and an integer $k,$ whether\n$avms(G)\\leq k$ is in NP. Our proof is based on the introduction of the notion\nof tight bramble, that serves as an obstruction for the corresponding search\nparameter. Our results imply that for a graph $G$, $avms(G)$ is equal to the\nCartesian tree product number of $G$ that is the minimum $k$ for which $G$ is a\nminor of the Cartesian product of a tree and a clique on $k$ vertices.",

    "abstract": "Mixup is an efficient data augmentation method which generates additional\nsamples through respective convex combinations of original data points and\nlabels. Although being theoretically dependent on data properties, Mixup is\nreported to perform well as a regularizer and calibrator contributing reliable\nrobustness and generalization to neural network training. In this paper,\ninspired by Universum Learning which uses out-of-class samples to assist the\ntarget tasks, we investigate Mixup from a largely under-explored perspective -\nthe potential to generate in-domain samples that belong to none of the target\nclasses, that is, universum. We find that in the framework of supervised\ncontrastive learning, universum-style Mixup produces surprisingly high-quality\nhard negatives, greatly relieving the need for a large batch size in\ncontrastive learning. With these findings, we propose Universum-inspired\nContrastive learning (UniCon), which incorporates Mixup strategy to generate\nuniversum data as g-negatives and pushes them apart from anchor samples of the\ntarget classes. Our approach not only improves Mixup with hard labels, but also\ninnovates a novel measure to generate universum data. With a linear classifier\non the learned representations, our method achieves 81.68% top-1 accuracy on\nCIFAR-100, surpassing the state of art by a significant margin of 5% with a\nmuch smaller batch size, typically, 256 in UniCon vs. 1024 in SupCon using\nResNet-50.",

The inconsistency between them makes the existing\ncalculation of volumetric gain inappropriate for a complete exploration of the\nenvironment. To address this issue, we propose a concave-hull based volumetric\ngain in a sampling-based exploration framework. The concave hull is constructed\nbased on the viewpoints generated by Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) and\nthe nodes that fail to expand. All space outside this concave hull is\nconsidered unknown. The volumetric gain is calculated based on the viewpoints\nconfiguration rather than using the occupancy map. With the new volumetric\ngain, robots can avoid inefficient or even erroneous exploration behavior\ncaused by the inappropriateness of existing volumetric gain calculation\nmethods. Our exploration method is evaluated against the existing\nstate-of-the-art RRT-based method in a benchmark environment.

    "abstract": "The purpose of cross-view image matching is to match images acquired from the\ndifferent platforms of the same target scene and then help positioning system\nto infer the location of the target scene. With the rapid development of drone\ntechnology, how to help Drone positioning or navigation through cross-view\nmatching technology has become a challenging research topic. However, the\naccuracy of current cross-view matching models is still low, mainly because the\nexisting public datasets do not include the differences in images obtained by\ndrones at different heights, and the types of scenes are relatively\nhomogeneous, which makes the models unable to adapt to complex and changing\nscenes. We propose a new cross-view dataset, SUES-200, to address these\nissues.SUES-200 contains images acquired by the drone at four flight heights\nand the corresponding satellite view images under the same target scene. To our\nknowledge, SUES-200 is the first dataset that considers the differences\ngenerated by aerial photography of drones at different flight heights. In\naddition, we build a pipeline for efficient training testing and evaluation of\ncross-view matching models. Then, we comprehensively evaluate the performance\nof feature extractors with different CNN architectures on SUES-200 through an\nevaluation system for cross-view matching models and propose a robust baseline\nmodel.

In essence, our training procedure trains models\nthat are conditioned upon a specific approximate setting and, thus, retain a\nhigh accuracy.

    "abstract": "In the last years there has been a growing attention towards predicting the\npolitical orientation of active social media users, being this of great help to\nstudy political forecasts, opinion dynamics modeling and users polarization.\nExisting approaches, mainly targeting Twitter users, rely on content-based\nanalysis or are based on a mixture of content, network and communication\nanalysis. The recent research perspective exploits the fact that a user's\npolitical affinity mainly depends on his/her positions on major political and\nsocial issues, thus shifting the focus on detecting the stance of users through\nuser-generated content shared on social networks. The work herein described\nfocuses on a completely unsupervised stance detection framework that predicts\nthe user's stance about specific social-political statements by exploiting\ncontent-based analysis of its Twitter timeline. The ground-truth user's stance\nmay come from Voting Advice Applications, online tools that help citizens to\nidentify their political leanings by comparing their political preferences with\nparty political stances. Starting from the knowledge of the agreement level of\nsix parties on 20 different statements, the objective of the study is to\npredict the stance of a Party p in regard to each statement s exploiting what\nthe Twitter Party account wrote on Twitter. To this end we propose\nTweets2Stance (T2S), a novel and totally unsupervised stance detector framework\nwhich relies on the zero-shot learning technique to quickly and accurately\noperate on non-labeled data. Interestingly, T2S can be applied to any social\nmedia user for any context of interest, not limited to the political one.\nResults obtained from multiple experiments show that, although the general\nmaximum F1 value is 0.4, T2S can correctly predict the stance with a general\nminimum MAE of 1.13, which is a great achievement considering the task\ncomplexity.",

We further model three successive\nstages of radicalization guided by prior theoretical works. Specific\nsub-populations of users, namely those on steady high and increasing conspiracy\nengagement pathways, progress successively through various radicalization\nstages. In contrast, users on the decreasing engagement pathway show distinct\nbehavior: they limit their CT discussions to specialized topics, participate in\ndiverse discussion groups, and show reduced conformity with conspiracy\nsubreddits.

    "title": "Diverse Instance Discovery: Vision-Transformer for Instance-Aware  Multi-Label Image Recognition",
    "abstract": "Previous works on multi-label image recognition (MLIR) usually use CNNs as a\nstarting point for research. In this paper, we take pure Vision Transformer\n(ViT) as the research base and make full use of the advantages of Transformer\nwith long-range dependency modeling to circumvent the disadvantages of CNNs\nlimited to local receptive field. However, for multi-label images containing\nmultiple objects from different categories, scales, and spatial relations, it\nis not optimal to use global information alone. Our goal is to leverage ViT's\npatch tokens and self-attention mechanism to mine rich instances in multi-label\nimages, named diverse instance discovery (DiD). To this end, we propose a\nsemantic category-aware module and a spatial relationship-aware module,\nrespectively, and then combine the two by a re-constraint strategy to obtain\ninstance-aware attention maps. Finally, we propose a weakly supervised object\nlocalization-based approach to extract multi-scale local features, to form a\nmulti-view pipeline. Our method requires only weakly supervised information at\nthe label level, no additional knowledge injection or other strongly supervised\ninformation is required. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our\nmethod significantly outperforms previous works and achieves state-of-the-art\nresults under fair experimental comparisons.",

AWKWARD agents can have their plans\nre-configured in real time to align with social role requirements under\nchanging environmental and social circumstances.

We present this architecture to\nmotivate the bridging between traditional symbolic- and behaviour-based AI\ncommunities, where such combined solutions can help MAS researchers in their\npursuit of building stronger, more robust intelligent agent teams.

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, we have witnessed a dramatic evolution in main-memory\ncapacity and multi-core parallelism of server hardware. To leverage this\nhardware potential, multi-core in-memory OLTP database systems have been\nextensively re-designed. The core objective of this re-design has been scaling\nup sequential execution of OLTP transactions, wherein alternative database\narchitectures have been explored to eliminate system bottlenecks and overheads\nimpeding inter-transaction parallelism to fully manifest. However,\nintra-transaction parallelism has been largely ignored by this previous work.\nWe conjecture this situation to have developed because OLTP workloads are\nsometimes deemed to have far too little intra-transactional parallelism and,\neven when this kind of parallelism is available, program analyses to recognize\nit in arbitrary stored procedures are considered too brittle to be used as a\ngeneral tool. Recently, however, a new concept of actor-relational database\nsystems has been proposed, raising hopes that application developers can\nspecify intra-transaction parallelism by modeling database applications as\ncommunicating actors. In this scenario, a natural question is whether an\nactor-relational database system with an asynchronous programming model can\nadequately expose the intra-transaction parallelism available in application\nlogic to modern multi-core hardware. Towards that aim, we conduct in this paper\nan experimental evaluation of the factors that affect intra-transaction\nparallelism in the prototype actor-relational database system REACTDB, with an\nOLTP application designed with task-level parallelism in mind, and with the\nsystem running on a multi-core machine.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the design of self-adjusting single-source tree networks. The\nproblem can be seen as a generalization of the classic list update problem to\ntrees, and finds applications in reconfigurable datacenter networks. We are\ngiven a fixed balanced binary tree T connecting n nodes V = {v_1, ... , v_n}. A\nsource node v_0, attached to the root of the tree, issues communication\nrequests to nodes in V, in an online and adversarial manner; the access cost of\na request to a node v, is given by the current depth of v in T. The online\nalgorithm can try to reduce the access cost by performing swap operations, with\nwhich the position of a node is exchanged with the position of its parent in\nthe tree; a swap operation costs one unit. The objective is to design an online\nalgorithm which minimizes the total access cost plus adjustment cost\n(swapping). Avin et al. recently presented Random-Push, a constant competitive\nonline algorithm for this problem, based on random walks, together with an\nanalysis exploiting the most recently used (MRU) property of random walks.\nWe study analytically and empirically, online algorithms for this problem. In\nparticular, we explore how to derandomize Random-Push. We consider a simple\nderandomized algorithm which we call Rotor-Push, as its behavior is reminiscent\nof rotor walks. We first prove that Rotor-Push is constant competitive: its\ncompetitive ratio is 12 and hence by a factor of five lower than the best\nexisting competitive ratio. In contrast to Random-Push, the algorithm does not\nfeature the MRU property, which requires a new analysis. We present a\nsignificantly improved and simpler analysis for the randomized algorithm,\nshowing that it is 16-competitive.

    "abstract": "The goal of information-seeking dialogue is to respond to seeker queries with\nnatural language utterances that are grounded on knowledge sources. However,\ndialogue systems often produce unsupported utterances, a phenomenon known as\nhallucination. Dziri et al. (2022)'s investigation of hallucinations has\nrevealed that existing knowledge-grounded benchmarks are contaminated with\nhallucinated responses at an alarming level (>60% of the responses) and models\ntrained on this data amplify hallucinations even further (>80% of the\nresponses). To mitigate this behavior, we adopt a data-centric solution and\ncreate FaithDial, a new benchmark for hallucination-free dialogues, by editing\nhallucinated responses in the Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW) benchmark. We observe\nthat FaithDial is more faithful than WoW while also maintaining engaging\nconversations. We show that FaithDial can serve as a training signal for: i) a\nhallucination critic, which discriminates whether an utterance is faithful or\nnot, and boosts the performance by 21.1 F1 score on the BEGIN benchmark\ncompared to existing datasets for dialogue coherence; ii) high-quality dialogue\ngeneration. We benchmark a series of state-of-the-art models and propose an\nauxiliary contrastive objective that achieves the highest level of faithfulness\nand abstractiveness based on several automated metrics. Further, we find that\nthe benefits of FaithDial generalize to zero-shot transfer on other datasets,\nsuch as CMU-Dog and TopicalChat. Finally, human evaluation reveals that\nresponses generated by models trained on FaithDial are perceived as more\ninterpretable, cooperative, and engaging.",

    "abstract": "Models of human behavior for prediction and collaboration tend to fall into\ntwo categories: ones that learn from large amounts of data via imitation\nlearning, and ones that assume human behavior to be noisily-optimal for some\nreward function. The former are very useful, but only when it is possible to\ngather a lot of human data in the target environment and distribution. The\nadvantage of the latter type, which includes Boltzmann rationality, is the\nability to make accurate predictions in new environments without extensive data\nwhen humans are actually close to optimal. However, these models fail when\nhumans exhibit systematic suboptimality, i.e. when their deviations from\noptimal behavior are not independent, but instead consistent over time. Our key\ninsight is that systematic suboptimality can be modeled by predicting policies,\nwhich couple action choices over time, instead of trajectories. We introduce\nthe Boltzmann policy distribution (BPD), which serves as a prior over human\npolicies and adapts via Bayesian inference to capture systematic deviations by\nobserving human actions during a single episode. The BPD is difficult to\ncompute and represent because policies lie in a high-dimensional continuous\nspace, but we leverage tools from generative and sequence models to enable\nefficient sampling and inference. We show that the BPD enables prediction of\nhuman behavior and human-AI collaboration equally as well as imitation\nlearning-based human models while using far less data.",

    "abstract": "Video Instance Segmentation is a fundamental computer vision task that deals\nwith segmenting and tracking object instances across a video sequence. Most\nexisting methods typically accomplish this task by employing a multi-stage\ntop-down approach that usually involves separate networks to detect and segment\nobjects in each frame, followed by associating these detections in consecutive\nframes using a learned tracking head. In this work, however, we introduce a\nsimple end-to-end trainable bottom-up approach to achieve instance mask\npredictions at the pixel-level granularity, instead of the typical\nregion-proposals-based approach. Unlike contemporary frame-based models, our\nnetwork pipeline processes an input video clip as a single 3D volume to\nincorporate temporal information. The central idea of our formulation is to\nsolve the video instance segmentation task as a tag assignment problem, such\nthat generating distinct tag values essentially separates individual object\ninstances across the video sequence (here each tag could be any arbitrary value\nbetween 0 and 1). To this end, we propose a novel spatio-temporal tagging loss\nthat allows for sufficient separation of different objects as well as necessary\nidentification of different instances of the same object. Furthermore, we\npresent a tag-based attention module that improves instance tags, while\nconcurrently learning instance propagation within a video. Evaluations\ndemonstrate that our method provides competitive results on YouTube-VIS and\nDAVIS-19 datasets, and has minimum run-time compared to other state-of-the-art\nperformance methods.",

    "abstract": "Future Exascale systems will feature massive parallelism, many-core\nprocessors and heterogeneous architectures. In this scenario, it is\nincreasingly difficult for HPC applications to fully and efficiently utilize\nthe resources in system nodes. Moreover, the increased parallelism exacerbates\nthe effects of existing inefficiencies in current applications. Research has\nshown that co-scheduling applications to share system nodes instead of\nexecuting each application exclusively can increase resource utilization and\nefficiency. Nevertheless, the current oversubscription and co-location\ntechniques to share nodes have several drawbacks which limit their\napplicability and make them very application-dependent.\nThis paper presents co-execution through system-wide scheduling. Co-execution\nis a novel fine-grained technique to execute multiple HPC applications\nsimultaneously on the same node, outperforming current state-of-the-art\napproaches. We implement this technique in nOS-V, a lightweight tasking library\nthat supports co-execution through system-wide task scheduling. Moreover, nOS-V\ncan be easily integrated with existing programming models, requiring no changes\nto user applications. We showcase how co-execution with nOS-V significantly\nreduces schedule makespan for several applications on single node and\ndistributed environments, outperforming prior node-sharing techniques.",

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of Advanced Meter Infrastructure (AMI) has dramatically\naltered the energy information landscape. However, our ability to use this\ninformation to generate actionable insights about residential electricity\ndemand remains limited. In this research, we propose and test a new framework\nfor understanding residential electricity demand by using a dynamic energy\nlifestyles approach that is iterative and highly extensible. To obtain energy\nlifestyles, we develop a novel approach that applies Latent Dirichlet\nAllocation (LDA), a method commonly used for inferring the latent topical\nstructure of text data, to extract a series of latent household energy\nattributes. By doing so, we provide a new perspective on household electricity\nconsumption where each household is characterized by a mixture of energy\nattributes that form the building blocks for identifying a sparse collection of\nenergy lifestyles. We examine this approach by running experiments on one year\nof hourly smart meter data from 60,000 households and we extract six energy\nattributes that describe general daily use patterns. We then use clustering\ntechniques to derive six distinct energy lifestyle profiles from energy\nattribute proportions. Our lifestyle approach is also flexible to varying time\ninterval lengths, and we test our lifestyle approach seasonally (Autumn,\nWinter, Spring, and Summer) to track energy lifestyle dynamics within and\nacross households and find that around 73% of households manifest multiple\nlifestyles across a year. These energy lifestyles are then compared to\ndifferent energy use characteristics, and we discuss their practical\napplications for demand response program design and lifestyle change analysis.",

Recently, it becomes a hot issue to study\nadversarial examples which poses a security challenge to deep hashing models.\nHowever, there is still a critical bottleneck: how to find a superior and exact\nsemantic representative as the guide to further enhance the adversarial attack\nand defense in deep hashing based retrieval. We, for the first time, attempt to\ndesign an effective adversarial learning with the min-max paradigm to improve\nthe robustness of hashing networks by using the generated adversarial samples.\nSpecifically, we obtain the optimal solution (called center code) through a\nproved Continuous Hash Center Method (CHCM), which preserves the semantic\nsimilarity with positive samples and dissimilarity with negative samples. On\none hand, we propose the Deep Hashing Central Attack (DHCA) for efficient\nattack on hashing retrieval by maximizing the Hamming distance between the hash\ncode of adversarial example and the center code. On the other hand, we present\nthe Deep Hashing Central Adversarial Training (DHCAT) to optimize the hashing\nnetworks for defense, by minimizing the Hamming distance to the center code.\nExtensive experiments on the benchmark datasets verify that our attack method\ncan achieve better performance than the state-of-the-arts, and our defense\nalgorithm can effectively mitigate the effects of adversarial perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent advances of deep neural networks, object detection for\nadverse weather remains challenging due to the poor perception of some sensors\nin adverse weather. Instead of relying on one single sensor, multimodal fusion\nhas been one promising approach to provide redundant detection information\nbased on multiple sensors. However, most existing multimodal fusion approaches\nare ineffective in adjusting the focus of different sensors under varying\ndetection environments in dynamic adverse weather conditions. Moreover, it is\ncritical to simultaneously observe local and global information under complex\nweather conditions, which has been neglected in most early or late-stage\nmultimodal fusion works. In view of these, this paper proposes a Global-Local\nAttention (GLA) framework to adaptively fuse the multi-modality sensing\nstreams, i.e., camera, gated camera, and lidar data, at two fusion stages.\nSpecifically, GLA integrates an early-stage fusion via a local attention\nnetwork and a late-stage fusion via a global attention network to deal with\nboth local and global information, which automatically allocates higher weights\nto the modality with better detection features at the late-stage fusion to cope\nwith the specific weather condition adaptively. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the superior performance of the proposed GLA compared with\nstate-of-the-art fusion approaches under various adverse weather conditions,\nsuch as light fog, dense fog, and snow.",

A growing body of work has advanced our\nunderstanding of these systems by providing empirical and theoretical analyses.\nHowever, existing empirical results are mixed, and theoretical proposals are\noften incompatible with each other. Our goal in this work is to bring\nmuch-needed organization to this field by offering a unifying framework for\nunderstanding conditions under which combining complementary strengths of human\nand ML leads to higher quality decisions than those produced by them\nindividually -- a state to which we refer to as human-ML complementarity. We\nfocus specifically on the context of human-ML predictive decision-making\nsystems and investigate optimal ways of combining human and ML-based predictive\ndecisions, accounting for the underlying causes of variation in their\njudgments. Within this scope, we present two crucial contributions. First,\ndrawing upon prior literature in human psychology, machine learning, and\nhuman-computer interaction, we introduce a taxonomy characterizing a wide\nvariety of criteria across which human and machine decision-making differ.\nBuilding on our taxonomy, our second contribution presents a unifying\noptimization-based framework for formalizing how human and ML predictive\ndecisions should be aggregated optimally. We show that our proposed framework\nencompasses several existing models of human-ML complementarity as special\ncases. Last but not least, the exploratory analysis of our framework offers a\ncritical piece of insight for future work in this area: the mechanism by which\nwe combine human-ML judgments should be informed by the underlying causes of\ntheir diverging decisions.",

The analysis relies on instantaneous\nmeasurements of up to twenty-four spatial-temporal variables with the four\nneighboring vehicles on current and adjacent lanes. Preliminary descriptive\ninvestigations by principal component and logistic analyses allow identifying\nmain variables intending a driver to change lanes.

Drawing from insights in communication literature, we introduce a\n\"public(s)-in-the-loop\" approach and enumerates three features that are central\nto this approach: publics as plural political entities, collective\ndecision-making through deliberation, and the construction of publics.

    "abstract": "Subword tokenization is a commonly used input pre-processing step in most\nrecent NLP models. However, it limits the models' ability to leverage\nend-to-end task learning. Its frequency-based vocabulary creation compromises\ntokenization in low-resource languages, leading models to produce suboptimal\nrepresentations. Additionally, the dependency on a fixed vocabulary limits the\nsubword models' adaptability across languages and domains. In this work, we\npropose a vocabulary-free neural tokenizer by distilling segmentation\ninformation from heuristic-based subword tokenization. We pre-train our\ncharacter-based tokenizer by processing unique words from multilingual corpus,\nthereby extensively increasing word diversity across languages. Unlike the\npredefined and fixed vocabularies in subword methods, our tokenizer allows\nend-to-end task learning, resulting in optimal task-specific tokenization. The\nexperimental results show that replacing the subword tokenizer with our neural\ntokenizer consistently improves performance on multilingual (NLI) and\ncode-switching (sentiment analysis) tasks, with larger gains in low-resource\nlanguages. Additionally, our neural tokenizer exhibits a robust performance on\ndownstream tasks when adversarial noise is present (typos and misspelling),\nfurther increasing the initial improvements over statistical subword\ntokenizers.",

    "abstract": "The desire to build good systems in the face of complex societal effects\nrequires a dynamic approach towards equity and access. Recent approaches to\nmachine learning (ML) documentation have demonstrated the promise of discursive\nframeworks for deliberation about these complexities.

Meanwhile, recent work in\nreinforcement learning design has shown that the effects of optimization\nobjectives on the resultant system behavior can be wide-ranging and\nunpredictable. In this paper we sketch a framework for documenting deployed\nlearning systems, which we call Reward Reports. Taking inspiration from various\ncontributions to the technical literature on reinforcement learning, we outline\nReward Reports as living documents that track updates to design choices and\nassumptions behind what a particular automated system is optimizing for.

Our main approach is to modify the\nalgebraic coding technique from static parameterized algorithm design, which\nhad not previously been used in a dynamic context. We particularly build off of\nthe `extensor coding' method of Brand, Dell and Husfeldt [STOC'18], employing\nproperties of the exterior algebra over different fields.\nFor the $k$-Path detection problem for directed graphs, it is known that no\nefficient dynamic algorithm exists (under popular assumptions from fine-grained\ncomplexity). We circumvent this by designing an efficient sensitivity oracle,\nwhich preprocesses a directed graph on $n$ vertices in $2^k poly(k)\nn^{\\omega+o(1)}$ time, such that, given $\\ell$ updates (mixing edge insertions\nand deletions, and vertex deletions) to that input graph, it can decide in time\n$\\ell^2 2^kpoly(k)$ and with high probability, whether the updated graph\ncontains a path of length $k$. We also give a deterministic sensitivity oracle\nrequiring $4^k poly(k) n^{\\omega+o(1)}$ preprocessing time and $\\ell^2\n2^{\\omega k + o(k)}$ query time, and obtain a randomized sensitivity oracle for\nthe task of approximately counting the number of $k$-paths. For $k$-Path\ndetection in undirected graphs, we obtain a randomized sensitivity oracle with\n$O(1.66^k n^3)$ preprocessing time and $O(\\ell^3 1.66^k)$ query time, and a\nbetter bound for undirected bipartite graphs.\nIn addition, we present the first fully dynamic algorithms for a variety of\nproblems: $k$-Partial Cover, $m$-Set $k$-Packing, $t$-Dominating Set,\n$d$-Dimensional $k$-Matching, and Exact $k$-Partial Cover. For example, for\n$k$-Partial Cover we show a randomized dynamic algorithm with $2^k\npoly(k)polylog(n)$ update time, and a deterministic dynamic algorithm with\n$4^kpoly(k)polylog(n)$ update time.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are of increasing importance to a growing\nnumber of sectors in the maritime industry, including offshore exploration,\nmarine transportation and defence operations. A major factor in the growth in\nuse and deployment of USVs is the increased operational flexibility that is\noffered through use of autonomous navigation systems that generate optimised\ntrajectories. Unlike path planning in terrestrial environments, planning in the\nmaritime environment is more demanding as there is need to assure mitigating\naction is taken against the significant, random and often unpredictable\nenvironmental influences from winds and ocean currents. With the focus of these\nnecessary requirements as the main basis of motivation, this paper proposes a\nnovel motion planner, denoted as GPMP2*, extending the application scope of the\nfundamental GP-based motion planner, GPMP2, into complex maritime environments.\nAn interpolation strategy based on Monte-Carlo stochasticity has been\ninnovatively added to GPMP2* to produce a new algorithm named GPMP2* with\nMonte-Carlo stochasticity (MC-GPMP2*), which can increase the diversity of the\npaths generated. In parallel with algorithm design, a ROS based\nfully-autonomous framework for an advanced unmanned surface vehicle, the WAM-V\n20 USV, has been proposed. The practicability of the proposed motion planner as\nwell as the fully-autonomous framework have been functionally validated in a\nsimulated inspection missions for an offshore wind farm in ROS.",

This\nembeds uncertainty into the reduced-order model, and hence the predictions\nsubsequently issued by the reduced-order model are endowed with uncertainty.\nThe learned reduced-order models are computationally efficient, which enables\nMonte Carlo sampling over the posterior distributions of reduced-order\noperators. Furthermore, the proposed Bayesian framework provides a statistical\ninterpretation of the Tikhonov regularization incorporated in the operator\ninference, and the empirical Bayes approach of maximum marginal likelihood\nsuggests a selection algorithm for the regularization hyperparameters.

    "abstract": "The high prevalence of depression in society has given rise to the need for\nnew digital tools to assist in its early detection. To this end, existing\nresearch has mainly focused on detecting depression in the domain of social\nmedia, where there is a sufficient amount of data. However, with the rise of\nconversational agents like Siri or Alexa, the conversational domain is becoming\nmore critical. Unfortunately, there is a lack of data in the conversational\ndomain. We perform a study focusing on domain adaptation from social media to\nthe conversational domain. Our approach mainly exploits the linguistic\ninformation preserved in the vector representation of text. We describe\ntransfer learning techniques to classify users who suffer from early signs of\ndepression with high recall. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a commonly\nused conversational dataset, and we highlight how the method can easily be used\nin conversational agents. We publicly release all source code.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel self-supervised Video Object Segmentation (VOS) approach\nthat strives to achieve better object-background discriminability for accurate\nobject segmentation. Distinct from previous self-supervised VOS methods, our\napproach is based on a discriminative learning loss formulation that takes into\naccount both object and background information to ensure object-background\ndiscriminability, rather than using only object appearance. The discriminative\nlearning loss comprises cutout-based reconstruction (cutout region represents\npart of a frame, whose pixels are replaced with some constant values) and tag\nprediction loss terms. The cutout-based reconstruction term utilizes a simple\ncutout scheme to learn the pixel-wise correspondence between the current and\nprevious frames in order to reconstruct the original current frame with added\ncutout region in it. The introduced cutout patch guides the model to focus as\nmuch on the significant features of the object of interest as the less\nsignificant ones, thereby implicitly equipping the model to address\nocclusion-based scenarios. Next, the tag prediction term encourages\nobject-background separability by grouping tags of all pixels in the cutout\nregion that are similar, while separating them from the tags of the rest of the\nreconstructed frame pixels. Additionally, we introduce a zoom-in scheme that\naddresses the problem of small object segmentation by capturing fine structural\ninformation at multiple scales. Our proposed approach, termed CT-VOS, achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on two challenging benchmarks: DAVIS-2017 and\nYoutube-VOS. A detailed ablation showcases the importance of the proposed loss\nformulation to effectively capture object-background discriminability and the\nimpact of our zoom-in scheme to accurately segment small-sized objects.",

Thus, the importance of\nrobust OOD detection is emphasized. Unfortunately, collecting OOD data is a\nchallenging task.

    "abstract": "We present a novel method for performing flexible, 3D-aware image content\nmanipulation while enabling high-quality novel view synthesis. While NeRF-based\napproaches are effective for novel view synthesis, such models memorize the\nradiance for every point in a scene within a neural network. Since these models\nare scene-specific and lack a 3D scene representation, classical editing such\nas shape manipulation, or combining scenes is not possible. Hence, editing and\ncombining NeRF-based scenes has not been demonstrated. With the aim of\nobtaining interpretable and controllable scene representations, our model\ncouples learnt scene-specific feature volumes with a scene agnostic neural\nrendering network. With this hybrid representation, we decouple neural\nrendering from scene-specific geometry and appearance. We can generalize to\nnovel scenes by optimizing only the scene-specific 3D feature representation,\nwhile keeping the parameters of the rendering network fixed. The rendering\nfunction learnt during the initial training stage can thus be easily applied to\nnew scenes, making our approach more flexible. More importantly, since the\nfeature volumes are independent of the rendering model, we can manipulate and\ncombine scenes by editing their corresponding feature volumes. The edited\nvolume can then be plugged into the rendering model to synthesize high-quality\nnovel views. We demonstrate various scene manipulations, including mixing\nscenes, deforming objects and inserting objects into scenes, while still\nproducing photo-realistic results.",

Obtaining high resolution SAR images requires precise ego\nvehicle velocity estimation. A small velocity estimation error can result in a\nfocused SAR image with objects at offset angles. In this paper, we consider an\nautomotive SAR system that produces SAR images of static objects based on ego\nvehicle velocity estimation from the radar return signal without the overhead\nin complexity and cost of using an auxiliary global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS) and inertial measurement unit (IMU). We derive a novel analytical\napproximation for the automotive SAR angle estimation error variance when the\nvelocity is estimated by the radar. The developed analytical analysis closely\npredicts the true SAR angle estimation variance, and also provides insights on\nthe effects of the radar parameters and the environment condition on the\nautomotive SAR angle estimation error. We evaluate via the analytical analysis\nand simulation tests the radar settings and environment condition in which the\nautomotive SAR attains a significant performance gain over the angular\nresolution of the short aperture physical antenna array. We show that, perhaps\nsurprisingly, when the velocity is estimated by the radar the performance\nadvantage of automotive SAR is realized only in limited conditions.

    "abstract": "Structural resonance involves the absorption of inertial loads by a tuned\nstructural elasticity: a process playing a key role in a wide range of\nbiological and technological systems, including many biological and\nbio-inspired locomotion systems. Conventional linear and nonlinear resonant\nstates typically exist at specific discrete frequencies, and specific symmetric\nwaveforms. This discreteness can be an obstacle to resonant control modulation:\ndeviating from these states, by breaking waveform symmetry or modulating drive\nfrequency, generally leads to losses in system efficiency. Here, we demonstrate\na new strategy for achieving these modulations at no loss of energetic\nefficiency. Leveraging fundamental advances in nonlinear dynamics, we\ncharacterise a new form of structural resonance: band-type resonance,\ndescribing a continuous band of energetically-optimal resonant states existing\naround conventional discrete resonant states. These states are a counterexample\nto the common supposition that deviation from a linear (or nonlinear) resonant\nfrequency necessarily involves a loss of efficiency. We demonstrate how\nband-type resonant states can be generated via a spectral shaping approach:\nwith small modifications to the system kinematic and load waveforms, we\nconstruct sets of frequency-modulated and symmetry-broken resonant states that\nshow equal energetic optimality to their conventional discrete analogues. The\nexistence of these non-discrete resonant states in a huge range of oscillators\n- linear and nonlinear, in many different physical contexts - is a new\ndynamical-systems phenomenon.

The MIPR\ncombines image-editing and pseudo-label technology to obtain labeled data.

    "abstract": "The design of structures submitted to aerodynamic loads usually requires the\ndevelopment of specific computational models considering fluid-structure\ninteractions. Models using structural frame elements are developed in several\nrelevant applications such as the design of advanced aircraft wings, wind\nturbine blades or power transmission lines. In the case of flexible frame\nstructures submitted to fluid flows, the consistent computation of inertial and\naerodynamic forces for large displacements is a challenging task. In this\narticle we present a novel formulation for the accurate computation of\naerodynamic forces for large displacements and rotations using the\nco-rotational approach, the quasi-steady theory and the principle of virtual\nwork. This formulation is coupled with a reference consistent co-rotational\nformulation for computing internal and inertial forces, providing a unified set\nof nonlinear balance equations. A numerical resolution procedure is proposed\nand implemented within the open-source library ONSAS. The proposed formulation\nand its implementation are validated through the resolution of five examples,\nincluding a realistic wind turbine analysis problem. The results provided by\nthe proposed formulation are compared with analytic solutions and solutions\nobtained using a lumped mass approach. The proposed formulation provides\naccurate solutions for challenging numerical problems with large displacements\nand rotations.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study quantum Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams($OBDD$)\nmodel; it is a restricted version of read-once quantum branching programs, with\nrespect to \"width\" complexity. It is known that the maximal gap between\ndeterministic and quantum complexities is exponential. But there are few\nexamples of functions with such a gap. We present a new technique\n(\"reordering\") for proving lower bounds and upper bounds for OBDD with an\narbitrary order of input variables if we have similar bounds for the natural\norder. Using this transformation, we construct a total function $REQ$ such that\nthe deterministic $OBDD$ complexity of it is at least $2^{\\Omega(n / \\log n)}$,\nand the quantum $OBDD$ complexity of it is at most $O(n^2/\\log n)$. It is the\nbiggest known gap for explicit functions not representable by $OBDD$s of a\nlinear width. Another function(shifted equality function) allows us to obtain a\ngap $2^{\\Omega(n)}$ vs $O(n^2)$.\nMoreover, we prove the bounded error quantum and probabilistic $OBDD$ width\nhierarchies for complexity classes of Boolean functions. Additionally, using\n\"reordering\" method we extend a hierarchy for read-$k$-times Ordered Binary\nDecision Diagrams ($k$-$OBDD$) of polynomial width, for $k = o(n / \\log^3 n)$.\nWe prove a similar hierarchy for bounded error probabilistic $k$-$OBDD$s of\npolynomial, superpolynomial and subexponential width.\nThe extended abstract of this work was presented on International\nComputer Science Symposium in Russia, CSR 2017, Kazan, Russia, June\n8 -- 12, 2017",

This study aims to investigate the\nimpact of initial outbreak locations on the risk of spatiotemporal transmission\nand reveal the driving force behind high-risk outbreak locations. First,\nintegrating mobile phone location data, we built a SLIR\n(susceptible-latent-infectious-removed)-based meta-population model to simulate\nthe spreading process of an infectious disease (i.e., COVID-19) across\nfine-grained intra-urban regions (i.e., 649 communities of Shenzhen City,\nChina). Based on the simulation model, we evaluated the transmission risk\ncaused by different initial outbreak locations by proposing three indexes\nincluding the number of infected cases (CaseNum), the number of affected\nregions (RegionNum), and the spatial diffusion range (SpatialRange). Finally,\nwe investigated the contribution of different influential factors to the\ntransmission risk via machine learning models. Results indicates that different\ninitial outbreak locations would cause similar CaseNum but different RegionNum\nand SpatialRange. To avoid the epidemic spread quickly to more regions, it is\nnecessary to prevent epidemic breaking out in locations with high\npopulation-mobility flow density. While to avoid epidemic spread to larger\nspatial range, remote regions with long daily trip distance of residents need\nattention. Those findings can help understand the transmission risk and driving\nforce of initial outbreak locations within cities and make precise prevention\nand control strategies in advance.",
