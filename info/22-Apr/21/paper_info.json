    "title": "Learning Theory of Mind via Dynamic Traits Attribution",
    "abstract": "Machine learning of Theory of Mind (ToM) is essential to build social agents\nthat co-live with humans and other agents. This capacity, once acquired, will\nhelp machines infer the mental states of others from observed contextual action\ntrajectories, enabling future prediction of goals, intention, actions and\nsuccessor representations. The underlying mechanism for such a prediction\nremains unclear, however. Inspired by the observation that humans often infer\nthe character traits of others, then use it to explain behaviour, we propose a\nnew neural ToM architecture that learns to generate a latent trait vector of an\nactor from the past trajectories. This trait vector then multiplicatively\nmodulates the prediction mechanism via a `fast weights' scheme in the\nprediction neural network, which reads the current context and predicts the\nbehaviour. We empirically show that the fast weights provide a good inductive\nbias to model the character traits of agents and hence improves mindreading\nability. On the indirect assessment of false-belief understanding, the new ToM\nmodel enables more efficient helping behaviours.",

    "abstract": "Semantic place annotation can provide individual semantics, which can be of\ngreat help in the field of trajectory data mining. Most existing methods rely\non annotated or external data and require retraining following a change of\nregion, thus preventing their large-scale applications. Herein, we propose an\nunsupervised method denoted as UPAPP for the semantic place annotation of\ntrajectories using spatiotemporal information. The Bayesian Criterion is\nspecifically employed to decompose the spatiotemporal probability of the\ncandidate place into spatial probability, duration probability, and visiting\ntime probability. Spatial information in ROI and POI data is subsequently\nadopted to calculate the spatial probability. In terms of the temporal\nprobabilities, the Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency weighting\nalgorithm is used to count the potential visits to different place types in the\ntrajectories, and generates the prior probabilities of the visiting time and\nduration. The spatiotemporal probability of the candidate place is then\ncombined with the importance of the place category to annotate the visited\nplaces. Validation with a trajectory dataset collected by 709 volunteers in\nBeijing showed that our method achieved an overall and average accuracy of\n0.712 and 0.720, respectively, indicating that the visited places can be\nannotated accurately without any external data.",

Additionally, we annotate\nthe coordinates of the main points of interest inside the museum, such as\npaintings, statues, and other items. Thanks to this manual process, we deliver\na new benchmark for PointGoal navigation inside this new space. Trajectories in\nthis dataset are far more complex and lengthy than existing ground-truth paths\nfor navigation in Gibson and Matterport3D.

Prior work has demonstrated that\npowerful attackers with detailed system knowledge can manipulate exchanged\nsensor data to deteriorate performance of the process, even leading to full\nshutdowns of plants. Identifying those attacks requires iterating over all\npossible sensor values, and running detailed system simulation or analysis to\nidentify optimal attacks.

Sintel logs the entire anomaly detection\njourney, providing detailed documentation of anomalies over time. It enables\nusers to analyze signals, compare methods, and investigate anomalies through an\ninteractive visualization tool, where they can annotate, modify, create, and\nremove events. Using these annotations, the framework leverages human knowledge\nto improve the anomaly detection pipeline. We demonstrate the usability,\nefficiency, and effectiveness of Sintel through a series of experiments on\nthree public time series datasets, as well as one real-world use case involving\nspacecraft experts tasked with anomaly analysis tasks. Sintel's framework,\ncode, and datasets are open-sourced at https://github.com/sintel-dev/.",

    "abstract": "Commentary driving is a technique in which drivers verbalise their\nobservations, assessments and intentions. By speaking out their thoughts, both\nlearning and expert drivers are able to create a better understanding and\nawareness of their surroundings. In the intelligent vehicle context, automated\ndriving commentary can provide intelligible explanations about driving actions,\nand thereby assist a driver or an end-user during driving operations in\nchallenging and safety-critical scenarios. In this paper, we conducted a field\nstudy in which we deployed a research vehicle in an urban environment to obtain\ndata. While collecting sensor data of the vehicle's surroundings, we obtained\ndriving commentary from a driving instructor using the think-aloud protocol. We\nanalysed the driving commentary and uncovered an explanation style; the driver\nfirst announces his observations, announces his plans, and then makes general\nremarks. He also made counterfactual comments. We successfully demonstrated how\nfactual and counterfactual natural language explanations that follow this style\ncould be automatically generated using a simple tree-based approach. Generated\nexplanations for longitudinal actions (e.g., stop and move) were deemed more\nintelligible and plausible by human judges compared to lateral actions, such as\nlane changes. We discussed how our approach can be built on in the future to\nrealise more robust and effective explainability for driver assistance as well\nas partial and conditional automation of driving functions.",

    "abstract": "We present a method to simulate movement in interaction with computers, using\nModel Predictive Control (MPC). The method starts from understanding\ninteraction from an Optimal Feedback Control (OFC) perspective. We assume that\nusers aim to minimize an internalized cost function, subject to the constraints\nimposed by the human body and the interactive system. In contrast to previous\nlinear approaches used in HCI, MPC can compute optimal controls for nonlinear\nsystems. This allows us to use state-of-the-art biomechanical models and handle\nnonlinearities that occur in almost any interactive system. Instead of torque\nactuation, our model employs second-order muscles acting directly at the\njoints. We compare three different cost functions and evaluate the simulated\ntrajectories against user movements in a Fitts' Law type pointing study with\nfour different interaction techniques. Our results show that the combination of\ndistance, control, and joint acceleration cost matches individual users'\nmovements best, and predicts movements with an accuracy that is within the\nbetween-user variance. To aid HCI researchers and designers, we introduce CFAT,\na novel method to identify maximum voluntary torques in joint-actuated models\nbased on experimental data, and give practical advice on how to simulate human\nmovement for different users, interaction techniques, and tasks.",

    "title": "Optical Remote Sensing Image Understanding with Weak Supervision:  Concepts, Methods, and Perspectives",
    "abstract": "In recent years, supervised learning has been widely used in various tasks of\noptical remote sensing image understanding, including remote sensing image\nclassification, pixel-wise segmentation, change detection, and object\ndetection. The methods based on supervised learning need a large amount of\nhigh-quality training data and their performance highly depends on the quality\nof the labels. However, in practical remote sensing applications, it is often\nexpensive and time-consuming to obtain large-scale data sets with high-quality\nlabels, which leads to a lack of sufficient supervised information. In some\ncases, only coarse-grained labels can be obtained, resulting in the lack of\nexact supervision. In addition, the supervised information obtained manually\nmay be wrong, resulting in a lack of accurate supervision. Therefore, remote\nsensing image understanding often faces the problems of incomplete, inexact,\nand inaccurate supervised information, which will affect the breadth and depth\nof remote sensing applications. In order to solve the above-mentioned problems,\nresearchers have explored various tasks in remote sensing image understanding\nunder weak supervision. This paper summarizes the research progress of weakly\nsupervised learning in the field of remote sensing, including three typical\nweakly supervised paradigms: 1) Incomplete supervision, where only a subset of\ntraining data is labeled; 2) Inexact supervision, where only coarse-grained\nlabels of training data are given; 3) Inaccurate supervision, where the labels\ngiven are not always true on the ground.",

In our study, we evaluate the\nprediction qualities of five GAMs as compared to six traditional ML models and\nassess their visual outputs for model interpretability.

    "abstract": "The wide deployment of IoT sensors has enabled the collection of very big\ntime series across different domains, from which advanced analytics can be\nperformed to find unknown relationships, most importantly the correlations\nbetween them. However, current approaches for correlation search on time series\nare limited to only a single temporal scale and simple types of relations, and\ncannot handle noise effectively. This paper presents the integrated SYnchronous\nCOrrelation Search (iSYCOS) framework to find multi-scale correlations in big\ntime series. Specifically, iSYCOS integrates top-down and bottom-up approaches\ninto a single auto-configured framework capable of efficiently extracting\ncomplex window-based correlations from big time series using mutual information\n(MI). Moreover, iSYCOS includes a novel MI-based theory to identify noise in\nthe data, and is used to perform pruning to improve iSYCOS performance.\nBesides, we design a distributed version of iSYCOS that can scale out in a\nSpark cluster to handle big time series. Our extensive experimental evaluation\non synthetic and real-world datasets shows that iSYCOS can auto-configure on a\ngiven dataset to find complex multi-scale correlations. The pruning and\noptimisations can improve iSYCOS performance up to an order of magnitude, and\nthe distributed iSYCOS can scale out linearly on a computing cluster.",

Recently this hypothesis has been\nchallenged by evidence showing that self-supervised models transfer better than\ntheir supervised counterparts, despite their inferior Imagenet accuracy. This\ncalls for identifying the additional factors, on top of Imagenet accuracy, that\nmake models transferable. In this work we show that high diversity of the\nfeatures learnt by the model promotes transferability jointly with Imagenet\naccuracy.

We show that nontrivial algorithms\nare still possible. We first give a randomized algorithm for the $L_1$-heavy\nhitters problem that outperforms the optimal deterministic Misra-Gries\nalgorithm on long streams. If the white-box adversary is computationally\nbounded, we use cryptographic techniques to reduce the memory of our\n$L_1$-heavy hitters algorithm even further and to design a number of additional\nalgorithms for graph, string, and linear algebra problems. The existence of\nsuch algorithms is surprising, as the streaming algorithm does not even have a\nsecret key in this model, i.e., its state is entirely known to the adversary.\nOne algorithm we design is for estimating the number of distinct elements in a\nstream with insertions and deletions achieving a multiplicative approximation\nand sublinear space; such an algorithm is impossible for deterministic\nalgorithms.\nWe also give a general technique that translates any two-player deterministic\ncommunication lower bound to a lower bound for {\\it randomized} algorithms\nrobust to a white-box adversary. In particular, our results show that for all\n$p\\ge 0$, there exists a constant $C_p>1$ such that any $C_p$-approximation\nalgorithm for $F_p$ moment estimation in insertion-only streams with a\nwhite-box adversary requires $\\Omega(n)$ space for a universe of size $n$.\nSimilarly, there is a constant $C>1$ such that any $C$-approximation algorithm\nin an insertion-only stream for matrix rank requires $\\Omega(n)$ space with a\nwhite-box adversary.

    "abstract": "The instruction learning paradigm -- where a model learns to perform new\ntasks from task descriptions alone -- has become popular in general-purpose\nmodel research. The capabilities of large transformer models as instruction\nlearners, however, remain poorly understood. We use a controlled synthetic\nenvironment to characterize such capabilities. Specifically, we use the task of\ndeciding whether a given string matches a regular expression (viewed as an\ninstruction) to identify properties of tasks, instructions, and instances that\nmake instruction learning challenging. For instance, we find that our model, a\nfine-tuned T5-based text2text transformer, struggles with large regular\nlanguages, suggesting that less precise instructions are challenging for\nmodels. Additionally, instruction executions that require tracking longer\ncontexts of prior steps are also more difficult. We use our findings to\nsystematically construct a challenging instruction learning dataset, which we\ncall Hard RegSet. Fine-tuning on Hard RegSet, our large transformer learns to\ncorrectly interpret only 65.6% of test instructions (with at least 90%\naccuracy), and 11%-24% of the instructions in out-of-distribution\ngeneralization settings.

    "abstract": "Silicon-photonic neural networks (SPNNs) have emerged as promising successors\nto electronic artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators by offering orders of\nmagnitude lower latency and higher energy efficiency. Nevertheless, the\nunderlying silicon photonic devices in SPNNs are sensitive to inevitable\nfabrication-process variations (FPVs) stemming from optical lithography\nimperfections. Consequently, the inferencing accuracy in an SPNN can be highly\nimpacted by FPVs -- e.g., can drop to below 10% -- the impact of which is yet\nto be fully studied. In this paper, we, for the first time, model and explore\nthe impact of FPVs in the waveguide width and silicon-on-insulator (SOI)\nthickness in coherent SPNNs that use Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs).\nLeveraging such models, we propose a novel variation-aware, design-time\noptimization solution to improve MZI tolerance to different FPVs in SPNNs.\nSimulation results for two example SPNNs of different scales under realistic\nand correlated FPVs indicate that the optimized MZIs can improve the\ninferencing accuracy by up to 93.95% for the MNIST handwritten digit dataset --\nconsidered as an example in this paper -- which corresponds to a <0.5% accuracy\nloss compared to the variation-free case. The proposed one-time optimization\nmethod imposes low area overhead, and hence is applicable even to\nresource-constrained designs",

    "abstract": "Comparing test suite effectiveness metrics has always been a research\nhotspot. However, prior studies have different conclusions or even contradict\neach other for comparing different test suite effectiveness metrics. The\nproblem we found most troubling to our community is that researchers tend to\noversimplify the description of the ground truth they use. For example, a\ncommon expression is that \"we studied the correlation between real faults and\nthe metric to evaluate (MTE)\". However, the meaning of \"real faults\" is not\nclear-cut. As a result, there is a need to scrutinize the meaning of \"real\nfaults\". Without this, it will be half-knowledgeable with the conclusions. To\ntackle this challenge, we propose a framework ASSENT (evAluating teSt Suite\nEffectiveNess meTrics) to guide the follow-up research. In nature, ASSENT\nconsists of three fundamental components: ground truth, benchmark test suites,\nand agreement indicator. First, materialize the ground truth for determining\nthe real order in effectiveness among test suites. Second, generate a set of\nbenchmark test suites and derive their ground truth order in effectiveness.\nThird, for the benchmark test suites, generate the MTE order in effectiveness\nby the metric to evaluate (MTE). Finally, calculate the agreement indicator\nbetween the two orders. Under ASSENT, we are able to compare the accuracy of\ndifferent test suite effectiveness metrics. We apply ASSENT to evaluate\nrepresentative test suite effectiveness metrics, including mutation score\nmetrics and code coverage metrics. Our results show that, based on the real\nfaults, mutation score and subsuming mutation score are the best metrics to\nquantify test suite effectiveness. Meanwhile, by using mutants instead of real\nfaults, MTEs will be overestimated by more than 20% in values.",

In practical scenarios\nwhere high-parallax or variable acceleration assumptions are rarely met (e.g.\nhovering aerial robot, smartphone AR user not gesticulating with phone),\nclassical visual-inertial initialization formulations often become\nill-conditioned and/or fail to meaningfully converge.

The input in hypergraph $k$-partitioning\nproblems is a hypergraph $G=(V, E)$ with positive hyperedge costs along with a\nfixed positive integer $k$. The goal is to find a partition of $V$ into $k$\nnon-empty parts $(V_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_k)$ -- known as a $k$-partition -- so as\nto minimize an objective of interest.\n1. If the objective of interest is the maximum cut value of the parts, then\nthe problem is known as Minmax-Hypergraph-$k$-Partition. A subset of hyperedges\nis a minmax-$k$-cut-set if it is the subset of hyperedges crossing an optimum\n$k$-partition for Minmax-Hypergraph-$k$-Partition.\n2.

    "abstract": "In selfish bin packing, each item is regarded as a player, who aims to\nminimize the cost-share by choosing a bin it can fit in. To have a least number\nof bins used, cost-sharing rules play an important role. The currently best\nknown cost sharing rule has a lower bound on $PoA$ larger than 1.45, while a\ngeneral lower bound 4/3 on $PoA$ applies to any cost-sharing rule under which\nno items have incentive unilaterally moving to an empty bin. In this paper, we\npropose a novel and simple rule with a $PoA$ matching the lower bound, thus\ncompletely resolving this game. The new rule always admits a Nash equilibrium\nand its $PoS$ is one. Furthermore, the well-known bin packing algorithm $BFD$\n(Best-Fit Decreasing) is shown to achieve a strong equilibrium, implying that a\nstable packing with an asymptotic approximation ratio of $11/9$ can be produced\nin polynomial time.",

    "title": "Does Interference Exist When Training a Once-For-All Network?",
    "abstract": "The Once-For-All (OFA) method offers an excellent pathway to deploy a trained\nneural network model into multiple target platforms by utilising the\nsupernet-subnet architecture. Once trained, a subnet can be derived from the\nsupernet (both architecture and trained weights) and deployed directly to the\ntarget platform with little to no retraining or fine-tuning. To train the\nsubnet population, OFA uses a novel training method called Progressive\nShrinking (PS) which is designed to limit the negative impact of interference\nduring training. It is believed that higher interference during training\nresults in lower subnet population accuracies. In this work we take a second\nlook at this interference effect. Surprisingly, we find that interference\nmitigation strategies do not have a large impact on the overall subnet\npopulation performance. Instead, we find the subnet architecture selection bias\nduring training to be a more important aspect. To show this, we propose a\nsimple-yet-effective method called Random Subnet Sampling (RSS), which does not\nhave mitigation on the interference effect. Despite no mitigation, RSS is able\nto produce a better performing subnet population than PS in four\nsmall-to-medium-sized datasets; suggesting that the interference effect does\nnot play a pivotal role in these datasets. Due to its simplicity, RSS provides\na $1.9\\times$ reduction in training times compared to PS. A $6.1\\times$\nreduction can also be achieved with a reasonable drop in performance when the\nnumber of RSS training epochs are reduced.

This free form of supervision ensures high generality and usability\nof the learned visual models, based on extensive heuristics on data collection\nto cover as many visual concepts as possible. Alternatively, learning with\nexternal knowledge about images is a promising way which leverages a much more\nstructured source of supervision.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning in speech involves training a speech representation\nnetwork on a large-scale unannotated speech corpus, and then applying the\nlearned representations to downstream tasks. Since the majority of the\ndownstream tasks of SSL learning in speech largely focus on the content\ninformation in speech, the most desirable speech representations should be able\nto disentangle unwanted variations, such as speaker variations, from the\ncontent. However, disentangling speakers is very challenging, because removing\nthe speaker information could easily result in a loss of content as well, and\nthe damage of the latter usually far outweighs the benefit of the former. In\nthis paper, we propose a new SSL method that can achieve speaker\ndisentanglement without severe loss of content. Our approach is adapted from\nthe HuBERT framework, and incorporates disentangling mechanisms to regularize\nboth the teacher labels and the learned representations. We evaluate the\nbenefit of speaker disentanglement on a set of content-related downstream\ntasks, and observe a consistent and notable performance advantage of our\nspeaker-disentangled representations.",

    "abstract": "System-level decision making in transportation needs to understand day-to-day\nvariation of network flows, which calls for accurate modeling and estimation of\nprobabilistic dynamic travel demand on networks. Most existing studies estimate\ndeterministic dynamic origin-destination (OD) demand, while the day-to-day\nvariation of demand and flow is overlooked. Estimating probabilistic\ndistributions of dynamic OD demand is challenging due to the complexity of the\nspatio-temporal networks and the computational intensity of the\nhigh-dimensional problems. With the availability of massive traffic data and\nthe emergence of advanced computational methods, this paper develops a\ndata-driven framework that solves the probabilistic dynamic origin-destination\ndemand estimation (PDODE) problem using multi-day data. Different statistical\ndistances (e.g., lp-norm, Wasserstein distance, KL divergence, Bhattacharyya\ndistance) are used and compared to measure the gap between the estimated and\nthe observed traffic conditions, and it is found that 2-Wasserstein distance\nachieves a balanced accuracy in estimating both mean and standard deviation.\nThe proposed framework is cast into the computational graph and a\nreparametrization trick is developed to estimate the mean and standard\ndeviation of the probabilistic dynamic OD demand simultaneously. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PDODE framework on both small\nand real-world networks. In particular, it is demonstrated that the proposed\nPDODE framework can mitigate the overfitting issues by considering the demand\nvariation. Overall, the developed PDODE framework provides a practical tool for\npublic agencies to understand the sources of demand stochasticity, evaluate\nday-to-day variation of network flow, and make reliable decisions for\nintelligent transportation systems.",

In SAR images, some areas\naffected by ocean phenomena, such as rain cells, upwellings, and internal\nwaves, or discharge from oil spills appear as dark spots on images. Dark spot\ndetection is the first step in the detection of oil spills, which then become\noil slick candidates. The accuracy of dark spot segmentation ultimately affects\nthe accuracy of oil slick identification. Although some advanced deep learning\nmethods that use pixels as processing units perform well in remote sensing\nimage semantic segmentation, detecting some dark spots with weak boundaries\nfrom noisy SAR images remains a huge challenge. We propose a dark spot\ndetection method based on superpixels deeper graph convolutional networks\n(SGDCN) in this paper, which takes the superpixels as the processing units and\nextracts features for each superpixel. The features calculated from superpixel\nregions are more robust than those from fixed pixel neighborhoods. To reduce\nthe difficulty of learning tasks, we discard irrelevant features and obtain an\noptimal subset of features. After superpixel segmentation, the images are\ntransformed into graphs with superpixels as nodes, which are fed into the\ndeeper graph convolutional neural network for node classification. This graph\nneural network uses a differentiable aggregation function to aggregate the\nfeatures of nodes and neighbors to form more advanced features. It is the first\ntime using it for dark spot detection. To validate our method, we mark all dark\nspots on six SAR images covering the Baltic Sea and construct a dark spots\ndetection dataset, which has been made publicly available\n(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12UavrntkDSPrItISQ8iGefXn2gIZHxJ6?usp=sharing).\nThe experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SGDCN is robust and\neffective.",

In fact, significant efforts are being\ndedicated by both the quantum physics and the classical communications\ncommunities on developing new architectures, solutions, and practical\nimplementations of quantum communication networks (QCNs). Although these\nefforts led to various advances in today's technologies, there still exists a\nnon-trivial gap between the research efforts of the two communities on\ndesigning and optimizing the QCN performance. For instance, most prior works by\nthe classical communications community ignore important quantum physics-based\nconstraints when designing QCNs. For example, many works on entanglement\ndistribution do not account for the decoherence of qubits inside quantum\nmemories and, thus, their designs become impractical since they assume an\ninfinite quantum states' lifetime. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nframework, dubbed physics-informed QCNs, for designing and analyzing the\nperformance of QCNs, by relying on the quantum physics principles that underly\nthe different QCN components. The need of the proposed approach is then\nassessed and its fundamental role in designing practical QCNs is analyzed\nacross various open research areas. Moreover, we identify novel\nphysics-informed performance metrics and controls that enable QCNs to leverage\nthe state-of-the-art advancements in quantum technologies to enhance their\nperformance. Finally, we analyze multiple pressing challenges and open research\ndirections in QCNs that must be treated using a physics-informed approach to\nlead practically viable results. Ultimately, this work attempts to bridge the\ngap between the classical communications and the quantum physics communities in\nthe area of QCNs to foster the development of future communication networks (6G\nand beyond, and the quantum Internet).",

We present JanusAQP, a new dynamic AQP system,\nwhich supports SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, and MAX queries under insertions and\ndeletions to the dataset. JanusAQP extends static partition tree synopses,\nwhich are hierarchical aggregations of datasets, into the dynamic setting. This\npaper contributes new methods for: (1) efficient initialization of the data\nsynopsis in the presence of incoming data, (2) maintenance of the data synopsis\nunder insertions/deletions, and (3) re-optimization of the partitioning to\nreduce the approximation error. JanusAQP reduces the error of a\nstate-of-the-art baseline by more than 60% using only 10% storage cost.\nJanusAQP can process more than 100K updates per second in a single node setting\nand keep the query latency at a millisecond level.",

    "title": "Scalable Motif Counting for Large-scale Temporal Graphs",
    "abstract": "One fundamental problem in temporal graph analysis is to count the\noccurrences of small connected subgraph patterns (i.e., motifs), which benefits\na broad range of real-world applications, such as anomaly detection, structure\nprediction, and network representation learning. However, existing works\nfocused on exacting temporal motif are not scalable to large-scale temporal\ngraph data, due to their heavy computational costs or inherent inadequacy of\nparallelism. In this work, we propose a scalable parallel framework for exactly\ncounting temporal motifs in large-scale temporal graphs. We first categorize\nthe temporal motifs based on their distinct properties, and then design\ncustomized algorithms that offer efficient strategies to exactly count the\nmotif instances of each category. Moreover, our compact data structures, namely\ntriple and quadruple counters, enable our algorithms to directly identify the\ntemporal motif instances of each category, according to edge information and\nthe relationship between edges, therefore significantly improving the counting\nefficiency. Based on the proposed counting algorithms, we design a hierarchical\nparallel framework that features both inter- and intra-node parallel\nstrategies, and fully leverages the multi-threading capacity of modern CPU to\nconcurrently count all temporal motifs. Extensive experiments on sixteen\nreal-world temporal graph datasets demonstrate the superiority and capability\nof our proposed framework for temporal motif counting, achieving up to 538*\nspeedup compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Despite the effort in the past years to improve the\nperformance in EM, the existing methods still require a huge amount of labeled\ndata in each domain during the training phase. These methods treat each domain\nindividually, and capture the specific signals for each dataset in EM, and this\nleads to overfitting on just one dataset. The knowledge that is learned from\none dataset is not utilized to better understand the EM task in order to make\npredictions on the unseen datasets with fewer labeled samples. In this paper,\nwe propose a new domain adaptation-based method that transfers the task\nknowledge from multiple source domains to a target domain. Our method presents\na new setting for EM where the objective is to capture the task-specific\nknowledge from pretraining our model using multiple source domains, then\ntesting our model on a target domain. We study the zero-shot learning case on\nthe target domain, and demonstrate that our method learns the EM task and\ntransfers knowledge to the target domain. We extensively study fine-tuning our\nmodel on the target dataset from multiple domains, and demonstrate that our\nmodel generalizes better than state-of-the-art methods in EM.",

While NAR\ngeneration can significantly accelerate inference speed for machine\ntranslation, the speedup comes at the cost of sacrificed translation accuracy\ncompared to its counterpart, auto-regressive (AR) generation. In recent years,\nmany new models and algorithms have been designed/proposed to bridge the\naccuracy gap between NAR generation and AR generation. In this paper, we\nconduct a systematic survey with comparisons and discussions of various\nnon-autoregressive translation (NAT) models from different aspects.\nSpecifically, we categorize the efforts of NAT into several groups, including\ndata manipulation, modeling methods, training criterion, decoding algorithms,\nand the benefit from pre-trained models. Furthermore, we briefly review other\napplications of NAR models beyond machine translation, such as dialogue\ngeneration, text summarization, grammar error correction, semantic parsing,\nspeech synthesis, and automatic speech recognition. In addition, we also\ndiscuss potential directions for future exploration, including releasing the\ndependency of KD, dynamic length prediction, pre-training for NAR, and wider\napplications, etc. We hope this survey can help researchers capture the latest\nprogress in NAR generation, inspire the design of advanced NAR models and\nalgorithms, and enable industry practitioners to choose appropriate solutions\nfor their applications.

    "abstract": "In this perspective paper we study the effect of non independent and\nidentically distributed (non-IID) data on federated online learning to rank\n(FOLTR) and chart directions for future work in this new and largely unexplored\nresearch area of Information Retrieval. In the FOLTR process, clients join a\nfederation to jointly create an effective ranker from the implicit click signal\noriginating in each client, without the need to share data (documents, queries,\nclicks). A well-known factor that affects the performance of federated learning\nsystems, and that poses serious challenges to these approaches, is the fact\nthat there may be some type of bias in the way the data is distributed across\nclients. While FOLTR systems are on their own rights a type of federated\nlearning system, the presence and effect of non-IID data in FOLTR has not been\nstudied. To this aim, we first enumerate possible data distribution settings\nthat may showcase data bias across clients and thus give rise to the non-IID\nproblem. Then, we study the impact of each of these settings on the performance\nof the current state-of-the-art FOLTR approach, the Federated Pairwise\nDifferentiable Gradient Descent (FPDGD), and we highlight which data\ndistributions may pose a problem for FOLTR methods. We also explore how common\napproaches proposed in the federated learning literature address non-IID issues\nin FOLTR. This allows us to unveil new research gaps that, we argue, future\nresearch in FOLTR should consider. This is an important contribution to the\ncurrent state of the field of FOLTR because, for FOLTR systems to be deployed,\nthe factors affecting their performance, including the impact of non-IID data,\nneed to thoroughly be understood.",

As sound provides the temporal\ncontexts of the scene, our framework learns to generate a video that is\nsemantically consistent with sound. First, our sound inversion module maps the\naudio directly into the StyleGAN latent space. We then incorporate the\nCLIP-based multimodal embedding space to further provide the audio-visual\nrelationships. Finally, the proposed frame generator learns to find the\ntrajectory in the latent space which is coherent with the corresponding sound\nand generates a video in a hierarchical manner. We provide the new\nhigh-resolution landscape video dataset (audio-visual pair) for the\nsound-guided video generation task.

    "abstract": "Neural networks have had discernible achievements in a wide range of\napplications. The wide-spread adoption also raises the concern of their\ndependability and reliability. Similar to traditional decision-making programs,\nneural networks can have defects that need to be repaired. The defects may\ncause unsafe behaviors, raise security concerns or unjust societal impacts. In\nthis work, we address the problem of repairing a neural network for desirable\nproperties such as fairness and the absence of backdoor. The goal is to\nconstruct a neural network that satisfies the property by (minimally) adjusting\nthe given neural network's parameters (i.e., weights). Specifically, we propose\nCARE (\\textbf{CA}usality-based \\textbf{RE}pair), a causality-based neural\nnetwork repair technique that 1) performs causality-based fault localization to\nidentify the `guilty' neurons and 2) optimizes the parameters of the identified\nneurons to reduce the misbehavior. We have empirically evaluated CARE on\nvarious tasks such as backdoor removal, neural network repair for fairness and\nsafety properties. Our experiment results show that CARE is able to repair all\nneural networks efficiently and effectively. For fairness repair tasks, CARE\nsuccessfully improves fairness by $61.91\\%$ on average. For backdoor removal\ntasks, CARE reduces the attack success rate from over $98\\%$ to less than\n$1\\%$. For safety property repair tasks, CARE reduces the property violation\nrate to less than $1\\%$. Results also show that thanks to the causality-based\nfault localization, CARE's repair focuses on the misbehavior and preserves the\naccuracy of the neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Vision-and-language Navigation (VLN) task requires an embodied agent to\nnavigate to a remote location following a natural language instruction.\nPrevious methods usually adopt a sequence model (e.g., Transformer and LSTM) as\nthe navigator.

However, the crucial navigation clues (i.e.,\nobject-level environment layout) for embodied navigation task is discarded\nsince the maintained vector is essentially unstructured. In this paper, we\npropose a novel Structured state-Evolution (SEvol) model to effectively\nmaintain the environment layout clues for VLN. Specifically, we utilise the\ngraph-based feature to represent the navigation state instead of the\nvector-based state. Accordingly, we devise a Reinforced Layout clues Miner\n(RLM) to mine and detect the most crucial layout graph for long-term navigation\nvia a customised reinforcement learning strategy. Moreover, the Structured\nEvolving Module (SEM) is proposed to maintain the structured graph-based state\nduring navigation, where the state is gradually evolved to learn the\nobject-level spatial-temporal relationship. The experiments on the R2R and R4R\ndatasets show that the proposed SEvol model improves VLN models' performance by\nlarge margins, e.g., +3% absolute SPL accuracy for NvEM and +8% for EnvDrop on\nthe R2R test set.",

    "abstract": "Unlike suggested during their early years of existence, Bitcoin and similar\ncryptocurrencies in fact offer significantly less privacy as compared to\ntraditional banking. A myriad of privacy-enhancing extensions to those\ncryptocurrencies as well as several clean-slate privacy-protecting\ncryptocurrencies have been proposed in turn. To convey a better understanding\nof the protection of popular design decisions, we investigate expected\nanonymity set sizes in an initial simulation study. The large variation of\nexpected transaction values yields soberingly small effective anonymity sets\nfor protocols that leak transaction values. We hence examine the effect of\npreliminary, intuitive strategies for merging groups of payments into larger\nanonymity sets, for instance by choosing from pre-specified value classes. The\nresults hold promise, as they indeed induce larger anonymity sets at\ncomparatively low cost, depending on the corresponding strategy",

    "abstract": "The evolution of High-Performance Computing (HPC) platforms enables the\ndesign and execution of progressively larger and more complex workflow\napplications in these systems. The complexity comes not only from the number of\nelements that compose the workflows but also from the type of computations they\nperform. While traditional HPC workflows target simulations and modelling of\nphysical phenomena, current needs require in addition data analytics (DA) and\nartificial intelligence (AI) tasks. However, the development of these workflows\nis hampered by the lack of proper programming models and environments that\nsupport the integration of HPC, DA, and AI, as well as the lack of tools to\neasily deploy and execute the workflows in HPC systems. To progress in this\ndirection, this paper presents use cases where complex workflows are required\nand investigates the main issues to be addressed for the HPC/DA/AI convergence.\nBased on this study, the paper identifies the challenges of a new workflow\nplatform to manage complex workflows. Finally, it proposes a development\napproach for such a workflow platform addressing these challenges in two\ndirections: first, by defining a software stack that provides the\nfunctionalities to manage these complex workflows; and second, by proposing the\nHPC Workflow as a Service (HPCWaaS) paradigm, which leverages the software\nstack to facilitate the reusability of complex workflows in federated HPC\ninfrastructures.

To this end, we present Disentangled Transformer, where both encoder\nand decoder are disentangled to facilitate learning of two sub-tasks.

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral images often have hundreds of spectral bands of different\nwavelengths captured by aircraft or satellites that record land coverage.\nIdentifying detailed classes of pixels becomes feasible due to the enhancement\nin spectral and spatial resolution of hyperspectral images. In this work, we\npropose a novel framework that utilizes both spatial and spectral information\nfor classifying pixels in hyperspectral images. The method consists of three\nstages. In the first stage, the pre-processing stage, Nested Sliding Window\nalgorithm is used to reconstruct the original data by {enhancing the\nconsistency of neighboring pixels} and then Principal Component Analysis is\nused to reduce the dimension of data. In the second stage, Support Vector\nMachines are trained to estimate the pixel-wise probability map of each class\nusing the spectral information from the images. Finally, a smoothed total\nvariation model is applied to smooth the class probability vectors by {ensuring\nspatial connectivity} in the images. We demonstrate the superiority of our\nmethod against three state-of-the-art algorithms on six benchmark hyperspectral\ndata sets with 10 to 50 training labels for each class. The results show that\nour method gives the overall best performance in accuracy. Especially, our gain\nin accuracy increases when the number of labeled pixels decreases and therefore\nour method is more advantageous to be applied to problems with small training\nset.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new technique based on a non-linear Minmax Detector\nBased (MDB) filter for image restoration. The aim of image enhancement is to\nreconstruct the true image from the corrupted image. The process of image\nacquisition frequently leads to degradation and the quality of the digitized\nimage becomes inferior to the original image. Image degradation can be due to\nthe addition of different types of noise in the original image. Image noise can\nbe modelled of many types and impulse noise is one of them. Impulse noise\ngenerates pixels with gray value not consistent with their local neighbourhood.\nIt appears as a sprinkle of both light and dark or only light spots in the\nimage. Filtering is a technique for enhancing the image. Linear filter is the\nfiltering in which the value of an output pixel is a linear combination of\nneighborhood values, which can produce blur in the image. Thus a variety of\nsmoothing techniques have been developed that are non linear. Median filter is\nthe one of the most popular non-linear filter. When considering a small\nneighborhood it is highly efficient but for large window and in case of high\nnoise it gives rise to more blurring to image. The Centre Weighted Mean (CWM)\nfilter has got a better average performance over the median filter. However the\noriginal pixel corrupted and noise reduction is substantial under high noise\ncondition. Hence this technique has also blurring affect on the image. To\nillustrate the superiority of the proposed approach, the proposed new scheme\nhas been simulated along with the standard ones and various restored\nperformance measures have been compared.",

    "abstract": "Attention mechanisms have significantly boosted the performance of video\nclassification neural networks thanks to the utilization of perspective\ncontexts. However, the current research on video attention generally focuses on\nadopting a specific aspect of contexts (e.g., channel, spatial/temporal, or\nglobal context) to refine the features and neglects their underlying\ncorrelation when computing attentions. This leads to incomplete context\nutilization and hence bears the weakness of limited performance improvement. To\ntackle the problem, this paper proposes an efficient attention-in-attention\n(AIA) method for element-wise feature refinement, which investigates the\nfeasibility of inserting the channel context into the spatio-temporal attention\nlearning module, referred to as CinST, and also its reverse variant, referred\nto as STinC. Specifically, we instantiate the video feature contexts as\ndynamics aggregated along a specific axis with global average and max pooling\noperations. The workflow of an AIA module is that the first attention block\nuses one kind of context information to guide the gating weights calculation of\nthe second attention that targets at the other context. Moreover, all the\ncomputational operations in attention units act on the pooled dimension, which\nresults in quite few computational cost increase ($<$0.02\\%). To verify our\nmethod, we densely integrate it into two classical video network backbones and\nconduct extensive experiments on several standard video classification\nbenchmarks.

Many app features that users have problems with are\nusually expressed by key phrases such as \"upload pictures\", which could be\nburied in the review texts. The lack of fine-grained view about problematic\nfeatures could obscure the developers' understanding of where the app is\nfrustrating users, and postpone the improvement of the apps. Existing\npattern-based approaches to extract target phrases suffer from low accuracy due\nto insufficient semantic understanding of the reviews, thus can only summarize\nthe high-level topics/aspects of the reviews.

SIRA also clusters the extracted phrases based on their\nsemantic relations and presents a visualization of the summaries. Our\nevaluation on 3,426 reviews from six apps confirms the effectiveness of SIRA in\nproblematic feature extraction and clustering.

    "abstract": "We introduce a new constrained optimization method for policy gradient\nreinforcement learning, which uses two trust regions to regulate each policy\nupdate. In addition to using the proximity of one single old policy as the\nfirst trust region as done by prior works, we propose to form a second trust\nregion through the construction of another virtual policy that represents a\nwide range of past policies. We then enforce the new policy to stay closer to\nthe virtual policy, which is beneficial in case the old policy performs badly.\nMore importantly, we propose a mechanism to automatically build the virtual\npolicy from a memory buffer of past policies, providing a new capability for\ndynamically selecting appropriate trust regions during the optimization\nprocess. Our proposed method, dubbed as Memory-Constrained Policy Optimization\n(MCPO), is examined on a diverse suite of environments including robotic\nlocomotion control, navigation with sparse rewards and Atari games,\nconsistently demonstrating competitive performance against recent on-policy\nconstrained policy gradient methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel congestion mitigation strategy for low voltage\nresidential feeders in which the rising power demand due to the electrification\nof the transport and heating systems leads to congestion problems. The strategy\nis based on requiring residential customers to limit their demand for a certain\namount of time in exchange for economic benefits.\nThe main novelty of the method consists of combining a thorough\nrepresentation of the network physics with advanced constraints that ensure the\ncomfort of residential users, in a scalable manner that suits real systems. The\nmitigation strategy is presented from a DSO perspective, and takes the form of\ncontracts between users and system operator. The focus on user comfort aims to\nmake the contracts appealing, encouraging users to voluntarily enroll in the\nproposed mitigation scheme.\nThe presented solution is implemented as a mixed-integer multi-period optimal\npower flow problem which relies on a linearized three-phase power flow\nformulation. Calculations on 100 real-life distribution feeders are performed,\nto analyze the congestion-relieving potential of several possible system\noperator-user contracts. From a planning perspective, the results can help the\nsystem operator define contractual terms that make a specific congestion\nmitigation scheme effective and viable.

    "abstract": "Person re-identification aims to retrieve persons in highly varying settings\nacross different cameras and scenarios, in which robust and discriminative\nrepresentation learning is crucial. Most research considers learning\nrepresentations from single images, ignoring any potential interactions between\nthem. However, due to the high intra-identity variations, ignoring such\ninteractions typically leads to outlier features. To tackle this issue, we\npropose a Neighbor Transformer Network, or NFormer, which explicitly models\ninteractions across all input images, thus suppressing outlier features and\nleading to more robust representations overall. As modelling interactions\nbetween enormous amount of images is a massive task with lots of distractors,\nNFormer introduces two novel modules, the Landmark Agent Attention, and the\nReciprocal Neighbor Softmax. Specifically, the Landmark Agent Attention\nefficiently models the relation map between images by a low-rank factorization\nwith a few landmarks in feature space. Moreover, the Reciprocal Neighbor\nSoftmax achieves sparse attention to relevant -- rather than all -- neighbors\nonly, which alleviates interference of irrelevant representations and further\nrelieves the computational burden. In experiments on four large-scale datasets,\nNFormer achieves a new state-of-the-art. The code is released at\n\\url{https://github.com/haochenheheda/NFormer}.",

Instead, in this work we make use of a noisy off-the-shelf\nsingle-image depth map estimation as a source of geometry.

For the subproblem of intra-pair power allocation within\neach NOMA user pair, we construct a supermodular game with confirmed\nconvergence to a Nash equilibrium. Given the intra-pair power allocation,\nsuccessive convex approximation is applied to convexify and solve the\nsubproblem of WPT time allocation and inter-pair power allocation between the\nuser pairs. Finally, we solve the subproblem of UAV placement by using the\nLagrange multiplier method. Simulations show that our approach can\nsubstantially outperform its alternatives that do not use NOMA and WPT\ntechniques or that do not optimize the UAV location.",

    "abstract": "A central aspect of robotic motion planning is collision avoidance, where a\nmultitude of different approaches are currently in use. Optimization-based\nmotion planning is one method, that often heavily relies on distance\ncomputations between robots and obstacles. These computations can easily become\na bottleneck, as they do not scale well with the complexity of the robots or\nthe environment. To improve performance, many different methods suggested to\nuse collision primitives, i.e. simple shapes that approximate the more complex\nrigid bodies, and that are simpler to compute distances to and from. However,\neach pair of primitives requires its own specialized code, and certain pairs\nare known to suffer from numerical issues. In this paper, we propose an\neasy-to-use, unified treatment of a wide variety of primitives. We formulate\ndistance computation as a minimization problem, which we solve iteratively. We\nshow how to take derivatives of this minimization problem, allowing it to be\nseamlessly integrated into a trajectory optimization method. Our experiments\nshow that our method performs favourably, both in terms of timing and the\nquality of the trajectory. The source code of our implementation will be\nreleased upon acceptance.",

    "abstract": "The stochastic nature of iterative optimization heuristics leads to\ninherently noisy performance measurements. Since these measurements are often\ngathered once and then used repeatedly, the number of collected samples will\nhave a significant impact on the reliability of algorithm comparisons. We show\nthat care should be taken when making decisions based on limited data.\nParticularly, we show that the number of runs used in many benchmarking\nstudies, e.g., the default value of 15 suggested by the COCO environment, can\nbe insufficient to reliably rank algorithms on well-known numerical\noptimization benchmarks.\nAdditionally, methods for automated algorithm configuration are sensitive to\ninsufficient sample sizes. This may result in the configurator choosing a\n`lucky' but poor-performing configuration despite exploring better ones. We\nshow that relying on mean performance values, as many configurators do, can\nrequire a large number of runs to provide accurate comparisons between the\nconsidered configurations. Common statistical tests can greatly improve the\nsituation in most cases but not always.

    "abstract": "Though offering amazing contextualized token-level representations, current\npre-trained language models actually take less attention on acquiring\nsentence-level representation during its self-supervised pre-training. If\nself-supervised learning can be distinguished into two subcategories,\ngenerative and contrastive, then most existing studies show that sentence\nrepresentation learning may more benefit from the contrastive methods but not\nthe generative methods. However, contrastive learning cannot be well compatible\nwith the common token-level generative self-supervised learning, and does not\nguarantee good performance on downstream semantic retrieval tasks.

However, it remains a challenging task to accurately record\nsuch knowledge due to the noisy nature of interleaved dialogs in live chat\ndata. In this paper, we first formulate the task of identifying and\nsynthesizing bug reports from community live chats, and propose a novel\napproach, named BugListener, to address the challenges. Specifically,\nBugListener automates three sub-tasks: 1) Disentangle the dialogs from massive\nchat logs by using a Feed-Forward neural network; 2) Identify the bug-report\ndialogs from separated dialogs by modeling the original dialog to the\ngraph-structured dialog and leveraging the graph neural network to learn the\ncontextual information; 3) Synthesize the bug reports by utilizing the TextCNN\nmodel and Transfer Learning network to classify the sentences into three\ngroups: observed behaviors (OB), expected behaviors (EB), and steps to\nreproduce the bug (SR). BugListener is evaluated on six open source projects.\nThe results show that: for bug report identification, BugListener achieves the\naverage F1 of 74.21%, improving the best baseline by 10.37%; and for bug report\nsynthesis task, BugListener could classify the OB, EB, and SR sentences with\nthe F1 of 67.37%, 87.14%, and 65.03%, improving the best baselines by 7.21%,\n7.38%, 5.30%, respectively.

    "abstract": "As the final stage of the multi-stage recommender system (MRS), reranking\ndirectly affects users' experience and satisfaction, thus playing a critical\nrole in MRS. Despite the improvement achieved in the existing work, three\nissues are yet to be solved. First, users' historical behaviors contain rich\npreference information, such as users' long and short-term interests, but are\nnot fully exploited in reranking. Previous work typically treats items in\nhistory equally important, neglecting the dynamic interaction between the\nhistory and candidate items. Second, existing reranking models focus on\nlearning interactions at the item level while ignoring the fine-grained\nfeature-level interactions. Lastly, estimating the reranking score on the\nordered initial list before reranking may lead to the early scoring problem,\nthereby yielding suboptimal reranking performance. To address the above issues,\nwe propose a framework named Multi-level Interaction Reranking (MIR). MIR\ncombines low-level cross-item interaction and high-level set-to-list\ninteraction, where we view the candidate items to be reranked as a set and the\nusers' behavior history in chronological order as a list. We design a novel\nSLAttention structure for modeling the set-to-list interactions with\npersonalized long-short term interests. Moreover, feature-level interactions\nare incorporated to capture the fine-grained influence among items. We design\nMIR in such a way that any permutation of the input items would not change the\noutput ranking, and we theoretically prove it. Extensive experiments on three\npublic and proprietary datasets show that MIR significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models using various ranking and utility metrics.",

    "title": "Case-Aware Adversarial Training",
    "abstract": "The neural network (NN) becomes one of the most heated type of models in\nvarious signal processing applications. However, NNs are extremely vulnerable\nto adversarial examples (AEs). To defend AEs, adversarial training (AT) is\nbelieved to be the most effective method while due to the intensive\ncomputation, AT is limited to be applied in most applications. In this paper,\nto resolve the problem, we design a generic and efficient AT improvement\nscheme, namely case-aware adversarial training (CAT). Specifically, the\nintuition stems from the fact that a very limited part of informative samples\ncan contribute to most of model performance. Alternatively, if only the most\ninformative AEs are used in AT, we can lower the computation complexity of AT\nsignificantly as maintaining the defense effect. To achieve this, CAT achieves\ntwo breakthroughs. First, a method to estimate the information degree of\nadversarial examples is proposed for AE filtering. Second, to further enrich\nthe information that the NN can obtain from AEs, CAT involves a weight\nestimation and class-level balancing based sampling strategy to increase the\ndiversity of AT at each iteration. Extensive experiments show that CAT is\nfaster than vanilla AT by up to 3x while achieving competitive defense effect.",

    "abstract": "The advancements in peer-to-peer wireless power transfer (P2P-WPT) have\nempowered the portable and mobile devices to wirelessly replenish their battery\nby directly interacting with other nearby devices. The existing works\nunrealistically assume the users to exchange energy with any of the users and\nat every such opportunity. However, due to the users' mobility, the inter-node\nmeetings in such opportunistic mobile networks vary, and P2P energy exchange in\nsuch scenarios remains uncertain. Additionally, the social interests and\ninteractions of the users influence their mobility as well as the energy\nexchange between them. The existing P2P-WPT methods did not consider the joint\nproblem for energy exchange due to user's inevitable mobility, and the\ninfluence of sociality on the latter. As a result of computing with imprecise\ninformation, the energy balance achieved by these works at a slower rate as\nwell as impaired by energy loss for the crowd. Motivated by this problem\nscenario, in this work, we present a wireless crowd charging method, namely\nMoSaBa, which leverages mobility prediction and social information for improved\nenergy balancing. MoSaBa incorporates two dimensions of social information,\nnamely social context and social relationships, as additional features for\npredicting contact opportunities. In this method, we explore the different\npairs of peers such that the energy balancing is achieved at a faster rate as\nwell as the energy balance quality improves in terms of maintaining low energy\nloss for the crowd. We justify the peer selection method in MoSaBa by detailed\nperformance evaluation. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art, the proposed\nmethod achieves better performance trade-offs between energy-efficiency, energy\nbalance quality and convergence time.",

Our scanpath prediction framework yields\nresults that outperform those of current state-of-the-art approaches, and are\nalmost on par with the human baseline, suggesting that our model is able to\ngenerate scanpaths whose behavior closely resembles those of the real ones.",

    "abstract": "Video moment retrieval aims at finding the start and end timestamps of a\nmoment (part of a video) described by a given natural language query. Fully\nsupervised methods need complete temporal boundary annotations to achieve\npromising results, which is costly since the annotator needs to watch the whole\nmoment. Weakly supervised methods only rely on the paired video and query, but\nthe performance is relatively poor. In this paper, we look closer into the\nannotation process and propose a new paradigm called \"glance annotation\". This\nparadigm requires the timestamp of only one single random frame, which we refer\nto as a \"glance\", within the temporal boundary of the fully supervised\ncounterpart. We argue this is beneficial because comparing to weak supervision,\ntrivial cost is added yet more potential in performance is provided. Under the\nglance annotation setting, we propose a method named as Video moment retrieval\nvia Glance Annotation (ViGA) based on contrastive learning. ViGA cuts the input\nvideo into clips and contrasts between clips and queries, in which glance\nguided Gaussian distributed weights are assigned to all clips. Our extensive\nexperiments indicate that ViGA achieves better results than the\nstate-of-the-art weakly supervised methods by a large margin, even comparable\nto fully supervised methods in some cases.",

In this paper,\nwe formulate the RL problem with safety constraints as a non-zero-sum game.\nWhile deployed with maximum entropy RL, this formulation leads to a safe\nadversarially guided soft actor-critic framework, called SAAC. In SAAC, the\nadversary aims to break the safety constraint while the RL agent aims to\nmaximize the constrained value function given the adversary's policy.

We illustrate the design of the adversary for these constraints.\nThen, in each of these variations, we show the agent differentiates itself from\nthe adversary's unsafe actions in addition to learning to solve the task.\nFinally, for challenging continuous control tasks, we demonstrate that SAAC\nachieves faster convergence, better efficiency, and fewer failures to satisfy\nthe safety constraints than risk-averse distributional RL and risk-neutral soft\nactor-critic algorithms.",

Although some\ntrimap-free approaches have been proposed, the matting quality is still\nunsatisfactory compared to trimap-based ones.

This accuracy is within 1% of the current\nstate-of-the-art method, JLJA (86.3%), which selects and fuses features\nengineered from skeleton data, depth videos, and inertial measurement units.\nBiFenceNet, a variant of FenceNet that captures the \"bidirectionality\" of human\nmovement through two separate networks, achieves 87.6% accuracy, outperforming\nJLJA. Since neither FenceNet nor BiFenceNet requires data from wearable\nsensors, unlike JLJA, they could be directly applied to most fencing videos,\nusing 2D pose data as input extracted from off-the-shelf 2D human pose\nestimators. In comparison to JLJA, our methods are also simpler as they do not\nrequire manual feature engineering, selection, or fusion.",

    "abstract": "Multi-cloud computing has become increasingly popular with enterprises\nlooking to avoid vendor lock-in. While most cloud providers offer similar\nfunctionality, they may differ significantly in terms of performance and/or\ncost. A customer looking to benefit from such differences will naturally want\nto solve the multi-cloud configuration problem: given a workload, which cloud\nprovider should be chosen and how should its nodes be configured in order to\nminimize runtime or cost? In this work, we consider solutions to this\noptimization problem. We develop and evaluate possible adaptations of\nstate-of-the-art cloud configuration solutions to the multi-cloud domain.\nFurthermore, we identify an analogy between multi-cloud configuration and the\nselection-configuration problems commonly studied in the automated machine\nlearning (AutoML) field. Inspired by this connection, we utilize popular\noptimizers from AutoML to solve multi-cloud configuration. Finally, we propose\na new algorithm for solving multi-cloud configuration, CloudBandit (CB). It\ntreats the outer problem of cloud provider selection as a best-arm\nidentification problem, in which each arm pull corresponds to running an\narbitrary black-box optimizer on the inner problem of node configuration. Our\nexperiments indicate that (a) many state-of-the-art cloud configuration\nsolutions can be adapted to multi-cloud, with best results obtained for\nadaptations which utilize the hierarchical structure of the multi-cloud\nconfiguration domain, (b) hierarchical methods from AutoML can be used for the\nmulti-cloud configuration task and can outperform state-of-the-art cloud\nconfiguration solutions and (c) CB achieves competitive or lower regret\nrelative to other tested algorithms, whilst also identifying configurations\nthat have 65% lower median cost and 20% lower median time in production,\ncompared to choosing a random provider and configuration.",

To reduce the gap, we propose a large-scale\nhuman motion dataset that delivers high-quality body pose sequences, scene\nscans, as well as ego-centric views with eye gaze that serves as a surrogate\nfor inferring human intent.

In this way, the temporal information and the spatial information can\nbe greatly aware of each other in both domains, during which, the\nspatiotemporal receptive field can also be greatly broadened for more reliable\nspatiotemporal modeling.

    "abstract": "Appearance-based gaze estimation aims to predict the 3D eye gaze direction\nfrom a single image. While recent deep learning-based approaches have\ndemonstrated excellent performance, they usually assume one calibrated face in\neach input image and cannot output multi-person gaze in real time. However,\nsimultaneous gaze estimation for multiple people in the wild is necessary for\nreal-world applications. In this paper, we propose the first one-stage\nend-to-end gaze estimation method, GazeOnce, which is capable of simultaneously\npredicting gaze directions for multiple faces (>10) in an image. In addition,\nwe design a sophisticated data generation pipeline and propose a new dataset,\nMPSGaze, which contains full images of multiple people with 3D gaze ground\ntruth. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified framework not only\noffers a faster speed, but also provides a lower gaze estimation error compared\nwith state-of-the-art methods. This technique can be useful in real-time\napplications with multiple users.",

The selection is\nclassically done offline, using openly available information about the problem\ninstance or features that are extracted from the instance during a dedicated\nfeature extraction step. This ignores valuable information that the algorithms\naccumulate during the optimization process.\nIn this work, we propose an alternative, online algorithm selection scheme\nwhich we coin per-run algorithm selection. In our approach, we start the\noptimization with a default algorithm, and, after a certain number of\niterations, extract instance features from the observed trajectory of this\ninitial optimizer to determine whether to switch to another optimizer. We test\nthis approach using the CMA-ES as the default solver, and a portfolio of six\ndifferent optimizers as potential algorithms to switch to. In contrast to other\nrecent work on online per-run algorithm selection, we warm-start the second\noptimizer using information accumulated during the first optimization phase. We\nshow that our approach outperforms static per-instance algorithm selection. We\nalso compare two different feature extraction principles, based on exploratory\nlandscape analysis and time series analysis of the internal state variables of\nthe CMA-ES, respectively.

    "title": "Generalizing to the Future: Mitigating Entity Bias in Fake News  Detection",
    "abstract": "The wide dissemination of fake news is increasingly threatening both\nindividuals and society. Fake news detection aims to train a model on the past\nnews and detect fake news of the future. Though great efforts have been made,\nexisting fake news detection methods overlooked the unintended entity bias in\nthe real-world data, which seriously influences models' generalization ability\nto future data. For example, 97\\% of news pieces in 2010-2017 containing the\nentity `Donald Trump' are real in our data, but the percentage falls down to\nmerely 33\\% in 2018. This would lead the model trained on the former set to\nhardly generalize to the latter, as it tends to predict news pieces about\n`Donald Trump' as real for lower training loss. In this paper, we propose an\nentity debiasing framework (\\textbf{ENDEF}) which generalizes fake news\ndetection models to the future data by mitigating entity bias from a\ncause-effect perspective. Based on the causal graph among entities, news\ncontents, and news veracity, we separately model the contribution of each cause\n(entities and contents) during training. In the inference stage, we remove the\ndirect effect of the entities to mitigate entity bias. Extensive offline\nexperiments on the English and Chinese datasets demonstrate that the proposed\nframework can largely improve the performance of base fake news detectors, and\nonline tests verify its superiority in practice. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work to explicitly improve the generalization ability of fake\nnews detection models to the future data.

Traditionally,\nComputational Fluid Dynamics solvers are employed to numerically solve the\nstorm surge governing equations that are Partial Differential Equations and are\ngenerally very costly to simulate. This study presents a neural network model\nthat can predict storm surge, informed by a database of synthetic storm\nsimulations. This model can serve as a fast and affordable emulator for the\nvery expensive CFD solvers. The neural network model is trained with the storm\ntrack parameters used to drive the CFD solvers, and the output of the model is\nthe time-series evolution of the predicted storm surge across multiple nodes\nwithin the spatial domain of interest. Once the model is trained, it can be\ndeployed for further predictions based on new storm track inputs. The developed\nneural network model is a time-series model, a Long short-term memory, a\nvariation of Recurrent Neural Network, which is enriched with Convolutional\nNeural Networks. The convolutional neural network is employed to capture the\ncorrelation of data spatially. Therefore, the temporal and spatial correlations\nof data are captured by the combination of the mentioned models, the ConvLSTM\nmodel. As the problem is a sequence to sequence time-series problem, an\nencoder-decoder ConvLSTM model is designed.

    "abstract": "Several emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies are rising as\ninteresting alternatives to build the Last-Level Cache (LLC). Their advantages,\ncompared to SRAM memory, are higher density and lower static power, but each\nwrite operation slightly wears out the bitcell, to the point of losing its\nstorage capacity. In this context, this paper proposes a new LLC organization\ndesigned to extend the lifetime of the NVM data array and a methodological\nproposal to forecast in detail the capacity and performance of NVM caches over\nits lifetime. Data compression is one of the techniques dealing with the\ndegradation of a NV-LLC, as it decreases the write bandwidth delivered to the\ncache. The proposed NV-LLC organization takes advantage of compression, but\nwith a relevant contribution: as capacity is reduced by write wear, degraded\ncache frames can allocate blocks whose compressed size is adequate. From a\nmethodological point of view, although different approaches are used in the\nliterature to analyze the degradation of a NV-LLC, none of them allows to study\nin detail its temporal evolution. In this sense, this work proposes a forecast\nprocedure that combines detailed simulation and prediction, allowing an\naccurate analysis of the impact of different cache control policies and\nmechanisms (replacement, wear leveling, compression, etc.) on the temporal\nevolution of the indices of interest, such as the effective capacity of the\nNV-LLC or the system IPC. The proposed NV-LLC organization has a small added\ncost compared to that of a baseline NV-LLC without compression in terms of\narea, latency and energy consumption, and increases up to 6-36 times the time\nrequired to reach 50% effective capacity in an STT-RAM-based NV-LLC.",

    "abstract": "The ability to continuously learn remains elusive for deep learning models.\nUnlike humans, models cannot accumulate knowledge in their weights when\nlearning new tasks, mainly due to an excess of plasticity and the low incentive\nto reuse weights when training a new task. To address the stability-plasticity\ndilemma in neural networks, we propose a novel method called Entropy-based\nStability-Plasticity (ESP). Our approach can decide dynamically how much each\nmodel layer should be modified via a plasticity factor. We incorporate branch\nlayers and an entropy-based criterion into the model to find such factor. Our\nexperiments in the domains of natural language and vision show the\neffectiveness of our approach in leveraging prior knowledge by reducing\ninterference. Also, in some cases, it is possible to freeze layers during\ntraining leading to speed up in training.",

Existing\nLF datasets represent only small portions of the plenoptic function, such that\nthey either cover a small volume, or they have limited field of view.\nTherefore, we propose a new LF image dataset \"SILVR\" that allows for\nsix-degrees-of-freedom navigation in much larger volumes while maintaining full\npanoramic field of view. We rendered three different virtual scenes in various\nconfigurations, where the number of views ranges from 642 to 2226. One of these\nscenes (called Zen Garden) is a novel scene, and is made publicly available. We\nchose to position the virtual cameras closely together in large cuboid and\nspherical organisations ($2.2m^3$ to $48m^3$), equipped with 180{\\deg} fish-eye\nlenses. Every view is rendered to a color image and depth map of 2048px\n$\\times$ 2048px. Additionally, we present the software used to automate the\nmulti-view rendering process, as well as a lens-reprojection tool that converts\nbetween images with panoramic or fish-eye projection to a standard rectilinear\n(i.e., perspective) projection. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed\ndataset and software can be used to evaluate LF coding/rendering techniques(in\nthis case for training NeRFs with instant-ngp). As such, we provide the first\npublicly-available LF dataset for large volumes of light with full panoramic\nfield of view",

    "abstract": "Modern code review is a critical and indispensable practice in a pull-request\ndevelopment paradigm that prevails in Open Source Software (OSS) development.\nFinding a suitable reviewer in projects with massive participants thus becomes\nan increasingly challenging task. Many reviewer recommendation approaches\n(recommenders) have been developed to support this task which apply a similar\nstrategy, i.e. modeling the review history first then followed by\npredicting/recommending a reviewer based on the model. Apparently, the better\nthe model reflects the reality in review history, the higher recommender's\nperformance we may expect. However, one typical scenario in a pull-request\ndevelopment paradigm, i.e. one Pull-Request (PR) (such as a revision or\naddition submitted by a contributor) may have multiple reviewers and they may\nimpact each other through publicly posted comments, has not been modeled well\nin existing recommenders. We adopted the hypergraph technique to model this\nhigh-order relationship (i.e. one PR with multiple reviewers herein) and\ndeveloped a new recommender, namely HGRec, which is evaluated by 12 OSS\nprojects with more than 87K PRs, 680K comments in terms of accuracy and\nrecommendation distribution. The results indicate that HGRec outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art recommenders on recommendation accuracy. Besides, among the\ntop three accurate recommenders, HGRec is more likely to recommend a diversity\nof reviewers, which can help to relieve the core reviewers' workload congestion\nissue. Moreover, since HGRec is based on hypergraph, which is a natural and\ninterpretable representation to model review history, it is easy to accommodate\nmore types of entities and realistic relationships in modern code review\nscenarios. As the first attempt, this study reveals the potentials of\nhypergraph on advancing the pragmatic solutions for code reviewer\nrecommendation.",

From an applied perspective, the goals of\ntheoretical analysis are to predict the empirical performance of an algorithm\nand to serve as a yardstick to design novel algorithms that perform well in\npractice. In this paper, we systematically survey the types of theoretical\nanalysis techniques that have been applied to edit distance and evaluate the\nextent to which each one has achieved these two goals. These techniques include\ntraditional worst-case analysis, worst-case analysis parametrized by edit\ndistance or entropy or compressibility, average-case analysis, semi-random\nmodels, and advice-based models. We find that the track record is mixed. On one\nhand, two algorithms widely used in practice have been born out of theoretical\nanalysis and their empirical performance is captured well by theoretical\npredictions.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have been\nincreasingly used in several fields to improve performance and the level of\nautomation. In recent years, this use has exponentially increased due to the\nadvancement of high-performance computing and the ever increasing size of data.\nOne of such fields is that of hardware design; specifically the design of\ndigital and analog integrated circuits~(ICs), where AI/ ML techniques have been\nextensively used to address ever-increasing design complexity, aggressive\ntime-to-market, and the growing number of ubiquitous interconnected devices\n(IoT). However, the security concerns and issues related to IC design have been\nhighly overlooked. In this paper, we summarize the state-of-the-art in AL/ML\nfor circuit design/optimization, security and engineering challenges, research\nin security-aware CAD/EDA, and future research directions and needs for using\nAI/ML for security-aware circuit design.",

A mathematical formulation of the stochastic two-echelon supply\nchain environment is given, which allows an arbitrary number of warehouses and\nproduct types to be managed. Additionally, an open-source library that\ninterfaces with deep reinforcement learning algorithms is developed and made\npublicly available for solving the inventory management problem. Performances\nachieved by state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms are\ncompared through a rich set of numerical experiments on synthetically generated\ndata. The experimental plan is designed and performed, including different\nstructures, topologies, demands, capacities, and costs of the supply chain.\nResults show that the PPO algorithm adapts very well to different\ncharacteristics of the environment. The VPG algorithm almost always converges\nto a local maximum, even if it typically achieves an acceptable performance\nlevel. Finally, A3C is the fastest algorithm, but just like the VPG, it never\nachieves the best performance when compared to PPO. In conclusion, numerical\nexperiments show that deep reinforcement learning performs consistently better\nthan standard inventory management strategies, such as the static (s,\nQ)-policy.

    "abstract": "Context. Technical Debt (TD) is a metaphor for technical problems that are\nnot visible to users and customers but hinder developers in their work, making\nfuture changes more difficult. TD is often incurred due to tight project\ndeadlines and can make future changes more costly or impossible. Project\nManagement usually focuses on customer benefits and pays less attention to\ntheir IT systems' internal quality. TD prevention should be preferred over TD\nrepayment because subsequent refactoring and re-engineering are expensive.\nObjective. This paper evaluates a framework focusing on both TD prevention and\nTD repayment in the context of agile-managed projects. The framework was\ndeveloped and applied in an IT unit of a publishing house. The unique\ncontribution of this framework is the integration of TD management into project\nmanagement. Method. The evaluation was performed as a comparative case study\nbased on ticket statistics and two structured surveys. The surveys were\nconducted in the observed IT unit using the framework and a comparison unit not\nusing the framework. The first survey targeted team members, the second one IT\nmanagers. Results. The evaluation shows that in this IT unit, the TAP framework\nled to a raised awareness for the incurrence of TD. Decisions to incur TD are\nintentional, and TD is repaid timelier. Unintentional TD incurred by\nunconscious decisions is prevented. Furthermore, better communication and\nbetter planning of the project pipeline can be observed. Conclusions. We\nprovide an insight into practitioners' ways to identify, monitor, prevent and\nrepay TD. The presented framework includes a feasible method for TD prevention\ndespite tight timelines by making TD repayment part of project management.",

In this paper we present a modular approach to\ncontrol plane verification, whereby end-to-end network properties are verified\nvia a set of purely local checks on individual nodes and edges. The approach\ntargets the verification of safety properties for BGP configurations and\nprovides guarantees in the face of both arbitrary external route announcements\nfrom neighbors and arbitrary node/link failures. We have proven the approach\ncorrect and also implemented it in a tool called Lightyear. Experimental\nresults show that Lightyear scales dramatically better than prior control plane\nverifiers. Further, we have used Lightyear to verify three properties of the\nwide area network of a major cloud provider, containing hundreds of routers and\ntens of thousands of edges.

In this paper, we propose Residual Mixture of Experts (RMoE), an\nefficient training pipeline for MoE vision transformers on downstream tasks,\nsuch as segmentation and detection. RMoE achieves comparable results with the\nupper-bound MoE training, while only introducing minor additional training cost\nthan the lower-bound non-MoE training pipelines.

To better understand how monolingual and multilingual PLMs\naffect different programming languages, we investigate 1) the performance of\nPLMs on Ruby for two popular Software Engineering tasks: Code Summarization and\nCode Search, 2) the strategy (to select programming languages) that works well\non fine-tuning multilingual PLMs for Ruby, and 3) the performance of the\nfine-tuned PLMs on Ruby given different code lengths.\nIn this work, we analyze over a hundred of pre-trained and fine-tuned models.\nOur results show that 1) multilingual PLMs have a lower Performance-to-Time\nRatio (the BLEU, METEOR, or MRR scores over the fine-tuning duration) as\ncompared to monolingual PLMs, 2) our proposed strategy to select target\nprogramming languages to fine-tune multilingual PLMs is effective: it reduces\nthe time to fine-tune yet achieves higher performance in Code Summarization and\nCode Search tasks, and 3) our proposed strategy consistently shows good\nperformance on different code lengths.",

    "title": "LAMNER: Code Comment Generation Using Character Language Model and Named  Entity Recognition",
    "abstract": "Code comment generation is the task of generating a high-level natural\nlanguage description for a given code method or function. Although researchers\nhave been studying multiple ways to generate code comments automatically,\nprevious work mainly considers representing a code token in its entirety\nsemantics form only (e.g., a language model is used to learn the semantics of a\ncode token), and additional code properties such as the tree structure of a\ncode are included as an auxiliary input to the model. There are two\nlimitations: 1) Learning the code token in its entirety form may not be able to\ncapture information succinctly in source code, and 2) The code token does not\ncontain additional syntactic information, inherently important in programming\nlanguages.\nIn this paper, we present LAnguage Model and Named Entity Recognition\n(LAMNER), a code comment generator capable of encoding code constructs\neffectively and capturing the structural property of a code token. A\ncharacter-level language model is used to learn the semantic representation to\nencode a code token. For the structural property of a token, a Named Entity\nRecognition model is trained to learn the different types of code tokens. These\nrepresentations are then fed into an encoder-decoder architecture to generate\ncode comments. We evaluate the generated comments from LAMNER and other\nbaselines on a popular Java dataset with four commonly used metrics. Our\nresults show that LAMNER is effective and improves over the best baseline model\nin BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3, BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and CIDEr by 14.34%,\n18.98%, 21.55%, 23.00%, 10.52%, 1.44%, and 25.86%, respectively. Additionally,\nwe fused LAMNER's code representation with the baseline models, and the fused\nmodels consistently showed improvement over the non-fused models. The human\nevaluation further shows that LAMNER produces high-quality code comments.",

    "abstract": "Pruning is an effective way to reduce the huge inference cost of large\nTransformer models. However, prior work on model pruning requires retraining\nthe model. This can add high cost and complexity to model deployment, making it\ndifficult to use in many practical situations. To address this, we propose a\nfast post-training pruning framework for Transformers that does not require any\nretraining. Given a resource constraint and a sample dataset, our framework\nautomatically prunes the Transformer model using structured sparsity methods.\nTo retain high accuracy without retraining, we introduce three novel\ntechniques: (i) a lightweight mask search algorithm that finds which heads and\nfilters to prune based on the Fisher information; (ii) mask rearrangement that\ncomplements the search algorithm; and (iii) mask tuning that reconstructs the\noutput activations for each layer. We apply our method to BERT-BASE and\nDistilBERT, and we evaluate its effectiveness on GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks. Our\nframework achieves up to 2.0x reduction in FLOPs and 1.56x speedup in inference\nlatency, while maintaining < 1% loss in accuracy. Importantly, our framework\nprunes Transformers in less than 3 minutes on a single GPU, which is over two\norders of magnitude faster than existing pruning approaches that retrain.

Despite sharing the high-level task and even the underlying\ninstruction-path data, performance on VLN-CE lags behind VLN significantly. In\nthis work, we explore this gap by transferring an agent from the abstract\nenvironment of VLN to the continuous environment of VLN-CE. We find that this\nsim-2-sim transfer is highly effective, improving over the prior state of the\nart in VLN-CE by +12% success rate.

In practice, we observe on-call\nengineers being hindered from quickly locating and fixing faulty cloud services\nbecause of the vast existence of misleading, non-informative, non-actionable\nalerts. We call the ineffectiveness of alerts \"anti-patterns of alerts\". To\nbetter understand the anti-patterns of alerts and provide actionable measures\nto mitigate anti-patterns, in this paper, we conduct the first empirical study\non the practices of mitigating anti-patterns of alerts in an industrial cloud\nsystem. We study the alert strategies and the alert processing procedure at\nHuawei Cloud, a leading cloud provider.

As a result, we summarized four individual anti-patterns\nand two collective anti-patterns of alerts. We also summarize four current\nreactions to mitigate the anti-patterns of alerts, and the general preventative\nguidelines for the configuration of alert strategy. Lastly, we propose to\nexplore the automatic evaluation of the Quality of Alerts (QoA), including the\nindicativeness, precision, and handleability of alerts, as a future research\ndirection that assists in the automatic detection of alerts' anti-patterns.

    "abstract": "In the past ten years there have been significant developments in\noptimization of transcoding parameters on a per-clip rather than per-genre\nbasis. In our recent work we have presented per-clip optimization for the\nLagrangian multiplier in Rate controlled compression, which yielded BD-Rate\nimprovements of approximately 2\\% across a corpus of videos using HEVC.\nHowever, in a video streaming application, the focus is on optimizing the\nrate/distortion tradeoff at a particular bitrate and not on average across a\nrange of performance. We observed in previous work that a particular multiplier\nmight give BD rate improvements over a certain range of bitrates, but not the\nentire range. Using different parameters across the range would improve gains\noverall. Therefore here we present a framework for choosing the best Lagrangian\nmultiplier on a per-operating point basis across a range of bitrates. In\neffect, we are trying to find the para-optimal gain across bitrate and\ndistortion for a single clip. In the experiments presented we employ direct\noptimization techniques to estimate this Lagrangian parameter path\napproximately 2,000 video clips. The clips are primarily from the YouTube-UGC\ndataset. We optimize both for bitrate savings as well as distortion metrics\n(PSNR, SSIM).",

    "abstract": "The majority of internet traffic is video content. This drives the demand for\nvideo compression to deliver high quality video at low target bitrates.\nOptimising the parameters of a video codec for a specific video clip (per-clip\noptimisation) has been shown to yield significant bitrate savings. In previous\nwork we have shown that per-clip optimisation of the Lagrangian multiplier\nleads to up to 24% BD-Rate improvement. A key component of these algorithms is\nmodeling the R-D characteristic across the appropriate bitrate range. This is\ncomputationally heavy as it usually involves repeated video encodes of the high\nresolution material at different parameter settings. This work focuses on\nreducing this computational load by deploying a NN operating on lower bandwidth\nfeatures.

This\ndefinition has also been suggested for incomplete data. However, the penalty\nterm based on the `complete' sample size $N$ is the same no matter whether in a\ncomplete or incomplete data case. For incomplete data, there are often only\n$N_i<N$ observations for variable $i$, which means that using the `complete'\nsample size $N$ implausibly ignores the amounts of missing information inherent\nin incomplete data. Given this observation, a novel criterion called\nhierarchical BIC (HBIC) for factor analysis with incomplete data is proposed.\nThe novelty is that it only uses the actual amounts of observed information,\nnamely $N_i$'s, in the penalty term. Theoretically, it is shown that HBIC is a\nlarge sample approximation of variational Bayesian (VB) lower bound, and BIC is\na further approximation of HBIC, which means that HBIC shares the theoretical\nconsistency of BIC. Experiments on synthetic and real data sets are conducted\nto access the finite sample performance of HBIC, BIC, and related criteria with\nvarious missing rates.

In this work,\nwe propose a novel Twin-Transformers framework to simultaneously infer common\nand individual functional networks in both spatial and temporal space, in a\nself-supervised manner. The first transformer takes space-divided information\nas input and generates spatial features, while the second transformer takes\ntime-related information as input and outputs temporal features.

Despite its\nlong history and intensive attention from the optimization and machine learning\ncommunity, the following major problem remains open. What is the last-iterate\nconvergence rate of the extragradient method for monotone and Lipschitz\nvariational inequalities with constraints? We resolve this open problem by\nshowing a tight $O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}}\\right)$ last-iterate convergence\nrate for arbitrary convex feasible sets, which matches the lower bound by\nGolowich et al.

The technical core of our result is the monotonicity of a new\nperformance measure -- the tangent residual, which can be viewed as an\nadaptation of the norm of the operator that takes the local constraints into\naccount. To establish the monotonicity, we develop a new approach that combines\nthe power of the sum-of-squares programming with the low dimensionality of the\nupdate rule of the extragradient method.

    "abstract": "We consider minimizing a smooth and strongly convex objective function using\na stochastic Newton method. At each iteration, the algorithm is given an oracle\naccess to a stochastic estimate of the Hessian matrix. The oracle model\nincludes popular algorithms such as the Subsampled Newton and Newton Sketch,\nwhich can efficiently construct stochastic Hessian estimates for many tasks.\nDespite using second-order information, these existing methods do not exhibit\nsuperlinear convergence, unless the stochastic noise is gradually reduced to\nzero during the iteration, which would lead to a computational blow-up in the\nper-iteration cost. We address this limitation with Hessian averaging: instead\nof using the most recent Hessian estimate, our algorithm maintains an average\nof all past estimates. This reduces the stochastic noise while avoiding the\ncomputational blow-up. We show that this scheme enjoys local $Q$-superlinear\nconvergence with a non-asymptotic rate of $(\\Upsilon\\sqrt{\\log (t)/t}\\,)^{t}$,\nwhere $\\Upsilon$ is proportional to the level of stochastic noise in the\nHessian oracle. A potential drawback of this (uniform averaging) approach is\nthat the averaged estimates contain Hessian information from the global phase\nof the iteration, i.e., before the iterates converge to a local neighborhood.\nThis leads to a distortion that may substantially delay the superlinear\nconvergence until long after the local neighborhood is reached. To address this\ndrawback, we study a number of weighted averaging schemes that assign larger\nweights to recent Hessians, so that the superlinear convergence arises sooner,\nalbeit with a slightly slower rate. Remarkably, we show that there exists a\nuniversal weighted averaging scheme that transitions to local convergence at an\noptimal stage, and still enjoys a superlinear convergence~rate nearly (up to a\nlogarithmic factor) matching that of uniform Hessian averaging.",

    "title": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Cardiac Segmentation: Towards  Structure Mutual Information Maximization",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation approaches have recently succeeded in various\nmedical image segmentation tasks. The reported works often tackle the domain\nshift problem by aligning the domain-invariant features and minimizing the\ndomain-specific discrepancies. That strategy works well when the difference\nbetween a specific domain and between different domains is slight. However, the\ngeneralization ability of these models on diverse imaging modalities remains a\nsignificant challenge. This paper introduces UDA-VAE++, an unsupervised domain\nadaptation framework for cardiac segmentation with a compact loss function\nlower bound. To estimate this new lower bound, we develop a novel Structure\nMutual Information Estimation (SMIE) block with a global estimator, a local\nestimator, and a prior information matching estimator to maximize the mutual\ninformation between the reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Specifically, we\ndesign a novel sequential reparameterization scheme that enables information\nflow and variance correction from the low-resolution latent space to the\nhigh-resolution latent space. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark cardiac\nsegmentation datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art qualitatively and quantitatively.

    "abstract": "The control Barrier function approach has been widely used for safe\ncontroller synthesis. By solving an online convex quadratic programming\nproblem, an optimal safe controller can be synthesized implicitly in\nstate-space. Since the solution is unique, the mapping from state-space to\ncontrol inputs is injective, thus enabling us to evaluate the underlying\nrelationship. In this paper we aim at explicitly synthesizing a safe control\nlaw as a function of the state for nonlinear control-affine systems with\nlimited control ability. We propose to transform the online quadratic\nprogramming problem into an offline parameterized optimisation problem which\nconsiders states as parameters. The obtained explicit safe controller is shown\nto be a piece-wise Lipschitz continuous function over the partitioned state\nspace if the program is feasible. We address the infeasible cases by solving a\nparameterized adaptive control Barrier function-based quadratic programming\nproblem. Extensive simulation results show the state-space partition and the\ncontroller properties.",

Our approach can be used to characterize the control\ninvariance of a given set in terms of safety of a general nonlinear control\nsystem subject to input constraints. From the point of view of controller\ndesign, the proposed method provides an approach to synthesize a safe control\nlaw that guarantees that the trajectories of the system starting from a given\ninitial set do not enter an unsafe set. Unlike the related control Barrier\nfunctions approach, our formulation only considers the vector field within the\ntangent cone of the zero level set defined by the certificates, and is shown to\nbe less conservative by means of numerical evidence.

    "abstract": "A fundamental problem in drug discovery is to design molecules that bind to\nspecific proteins. To tackle this problem using machine learning methods, here\nwe propose a novel and effective framework, known as GraphBP, to generate 3D\nmolecules that bind to given proteins by placing atoms of specific types and\nlocations to the given binding site one by one. In particular, at each step, we\nfirst employ a 3D graph neural network to obtain geometry-aware and chemically\ninformative representations from the intermediate contextual information. Such\ncontext includes the given binding site and atoms placed in the previous steps.\nSecond, to preserve the desirable equivariance property, we select a local\nreference atom according to the designed auxiliary classifiers and then\nconstruct a local spherical coordinate system. Finally, to place a new atom, we\ngenerate its atom type and relative location w.r.t. the constructed local\ncoordinate system via a flow model. We also consider generating the variables\nof interest sequentially to capture the underlying dependencies among them.\nExperiments demonstrate that our GraphBP is effective to generate 3D molecules\nwith binding ability to target protein binding sites.

However, one CAZyme may belong to several\nclasses. This leads to Multi-label CAZyme classification. Secondly, to capture\ninformation from the secondary structure of protein, protein classification is\nmodeled as graph classification problem. Thirdly, compound-protein interactions\nprediction employs graph learning for compound with sequential embedding for\nprotein. This can be seen as classification task for compound-protein pairs.\nThis paper proposes three models for protein classification.

    "abstract": "The approximate uniform sampling of graph realizations with a given degree\nsequence is an everyday task in several social science, computer science,\nengineering etc. projects. One approach is using Markov chains. The best\navailable current result about the well-studied switch Markov chain is that it\nis rapidly mixing on P-stable degree sequences (see\nDOI:10.1016/j.ejc.2021.103421). The switch Markov chain does not change any\ndegree sequence. However, there are cases where degree intervals are specified\nrather than a single degree sequence. (A natural scenario where this problem\narises is in hypothesis testing on social networks that are only partially\nobserved.) Rechner, Strowick, and M\\\"uller-Hannemann introduced in 2018 the\nnotion of degree interval Markov chain which uses three (separately\nwell-studied) local operations (switch, hinge-flip and toggle), and employing\non degree sequence realizations where any two sequences under scrutiny have\nvery small coordinate-wise distance. Recently Amanatidis and Kleer published a\nbeautiful paper (arXiv:2110.09068), showing that the degree interval Markov\nchain is rapidly mixing if the sequences are coming from a system of very thin\nintervals which are centered not far from a regular degree sequence.

    "abstract": "The superposition of data sets with internal parametric self-similarity is a\nlongstanding and widespread technique for the analysis of many types of\nexperimental data across the physical sciences. Typically, this superposition\nis performed manually, or recently by one of a few automated algorithms.\nHowever, these methods are often heuristic in nature, are prone to user bias\nvia manual data shifting or parameterization, and lack a native framework for\nhandling uncertainty in both the data and the resulting model of the superposed\ndata. In this work, we develop a data-driven, non-parametric method for\nsuperposing experimental data with arbitrary coordinate transformations, which\nemploys Gaussian process regression to learn statistical models that describe\nthe data, and then uses maximum a posteriori estimation to optimally superpose\nthe data sets. This statistical framework is robust to experimental noise, and\nautomatically produces uncertainty estimates for the learned coordinate\ntransformations. Moreover, it is distinguished from black-box machine learning\nin its interpretability -- specifically, it produces a model that may itself be\ninterrogated to gain insight into the system under study. We demonstrate these\nsalient features of our method through its application to four representative\ndata sets characterizing the mechanics of soft materials. In every case, our\nmethod replicates results obtained using other approaches, but with reduced\nbias and the addition of uncertainty estimates. This method enables a\nstandardized, statistical treatment of self-similar data across many fields,\nproducing interpretable data-driven models that may inform applications such as\nmaterials classification, design, and discovery.",

Automatic segmentation of the\ndeveloping fetal brain is a vital step in the quantitative analysis of prenatal\nneurodevelopment both in the research and clinical context. However, manual\nsegmentation of cerebral structures is time-consuming and prone to error and\ninter-observer variability. Therefore, we organized the Fetal Tissue Annotation\n(FeTA) Challenge in 2021 in order to encourage the development of automatic\nsegmentation algorithms on an international level. The challenge utilized FeTA\nDataset, an open dataset of fetal brain MRI reconstructions segmented into\nseven different tissues (external cerebrospinal fluid, grey matter, white\nmatter, ventricles, cerebellum, brainstem, deep grey matter). 20 international\nteams participated in this challenge, submitting a total of 21 algorithms for\nevaluation. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the results from\nboth a technical and clinical perspective. All participants relied on deep\nlearning methods, mainly U-Nets, with some variability present in the network\narchitecture, optimization, and image pre- and post-processing. The majority of\nteams used existing medical imaging deep learning frameworks. The main\ndifferences between the submissions were the fine tuning done during training,\nand the specific pre- and post-processing steps performed. The challenge\nresults showed that almost all submissions performed similarly. Four of the top\nfive teams used ensemble learning methods. However, one team's algorithm\nperformed significantly superior to the other submissions, and consisted of an\nasymmetrical U-Net network architecture. This paper provides a first of its\nkind benchmark for future automatic multi-tissue segmentation algorithms for\nthe developing human brain in utero.",

First, we extract optimal feature\nmodels in the frequency domain using an automated machine learning framework,\nachieving a 93.95% accuracy, with a 0.838 F1 score for a 4 temporal EEG channel\nsetup. The achieved accuracy levels surpass state-of-the-art by nearly 20%.\nThen, these algorithms are parallelized and optimized for a PULP platform,\nachieving a 5.21 times improvement of energy-efficient compared to\nstate-of-the-art low-power implementations of artifact detection frameworks.\nCombining this model with a low-power seizure detection algorithm would allow\nfor 300h of continuous monitoring on a 300 mAh battery in a wearable form\nfactor and power budget. These results pave the way for implementing\naffordable, wearable, long-term epilepsy monitoring solutions with low\nfalse-positive rates and high sensitivity, meeting both patients' and\ncaregivers' requirements.",

There have been many attempts to replace TCAD with deep\nlearning, but it has not yet been completely replaced. This paper presents a\nnovel algorithm restructuring the traditional TCAD system. The proposed\nalgorithm predicts three-dimensional (3-D) TCAD simulation in real-time while\ncapturing a variance, enables deep learning and TCAD to complement each other,\nand fully resolves convergence errors.",

    "title": "Dissipative stabilization of linear input delay systems via dynamical  state feedback controllers: an optimization based approach",
    "abstract": "In this note, we present an effective solution to stabilize linear input\ndelay systems subject to dissipative constraints while all the effect of input\ndelay is compensated by a novel controller. The method is inspired by the\nrecent development in the mathematical treatment of distributed delays and\npredictor controllers, which are critical for the derivation of the solution.\nAn important conceptual innovation is the use of a parameterized dynamical\nstate feedback controller, where the dimension of the controller equals the\ndimension of the control input. A sufficient condition for the existence of a\ndissipative dynamical state feedback controller is obtained via the Krasovskii\nfunctional approach, where the condition includes a bilinear matrix inequality\n(BMI). To solve the BMI, we apply an inner convex approximation algorithm which\ncan be initialized based on an explicit construction of a predictor controller\ngain. The dynamical state controller in this paper can be considered as an\nextension of the classical predictor controller, thereby capable of\ncompensating all the effects of the pointwise input delay while satisfying\ndissipative constraints. A numerical example is given to illustrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed methodology.",

    "title": "Estimating city-wide hourly bicycle flow using a hybrid LSTM MDN",
    "abstract": "Cycling can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution and increase\npublic health. With this in mind, policy-makers in cities worldwide seek to\nimprove the bicycle mode-share. However, they often struggle against the fear\nand the perceived riskiness of cycling. Efforts to increase the bicycle's\nmode-share involve many measures, one of them being the improvement of cycling\nsafety. This requires the analysis of the factors surrounding accidents and the\noutcome. However, meaningful analysis of cycling safety requires accurate\nbicycle flow data that is generally sparse or not even available at a segment\nlevel. Therefore, safety engineers often rely on aggregated variables or\ncalibration factors that fail to account for variations in the cycling traffic\ncaused by external factors. This paper fills this gap by presenting a Deep\nLearning based approach, the Long Short-Term Memory Mixture Density Network\n(LSTMMDN), to estimate hourly bicycle flow in Copenhagen, conditional on\nweather, temporal and road conditions at the segment level. This method\naddresses the shortcomings in the calibration factor method and results in\n66-77\\% more accurate bicycle traffic estimates. To quantify the impact of more\naccurate bicycle traffic estimates in cycling safety analysis, we estimate\nbicycle crash risk models to evaluate bicycle crashes in Copenhagen. The models\nare identical except for the exposure variables being used. One model is\nestimated using the LSTMMDN estimates, one using the calibration-based\nestimates, and one using yearly mean traffic estimates. The results show that\ninvesting in more advanced methods for obtaining bicycle volume estimates can\nbenefit the quality, mitigating efforts by improving safety analyses and other\nperformance measures.",

    "abstract": "Forecasting time series data presents an emerging field of data science that\nhas its application ranging from stock price and exchange rate prediction to\nthe early prediction of epidemics. Numerous statistical and machine learning\nmethods have been proposed in the last five decades with the demand for\ngenerating high-quality and reliable forecasts. However, in real-life\nprediction problems, situations exist in which a model based on one of the\nabove paradigms is preferable, and therefore, hybrid solutions are needed to\nbridge the gap between classical forecasting methods and scalable neural\nnetwork models. We introduce an interpretable probabilistic autoregressive\nneural network model for an explainable, scalable, and \"white box-like\"\nframework that can handle a wide variety of irregular time series data (e.g.,\nnonlinearity and nonstationarity). Sufficient conditions for asymptotic\nstationarity and geometric ergodicity are obtained by considering the\nasymptotic behavior of the associated Markov chain. During computational\nexperiments, PARNN outperforms standard statistical, machine learning, and deep\nlearning models on a diverse collection of real-world datasets coming from\neconomics, finance, and epidemiology, to mention a few. Furthermore, the\nproposed PARNN model improves forecast accuracy significantly for 10 out of 12\ndatasets compared to state-of-the-art models for short to long-term forecasts.",

    "abstract": "Superconducting optoelectronic hardware is being explored as a path towards\nartificial spiking neural networks with unprecedented scales of complexity and\ncomputational ability. Such hardware combines integrated-photonic components\nfor few-photon, light-speed communication with superconducting circuits for\nfast, energy-efficient computation. Monolithic integration of superconducting\nand photonic devices is necessary for the scaling of this technology. In the\npresent work, superconducting-nanowire single-photon detectors are\nmonolithically integrated with Josephson junctions for the first time, enabling\nthe realization of superconducting optoelectronic synapses. We present circuits\nthat perform analog weighting and temporal leaky integration of single-photon\npresynaptic signals. Synaptic weighting is implemented in the electronic domain\nso that binary, single-photon communication can be maintained. Records of\nrecent synaptic activity are locally stored as current in superconducting\nloops. Dendritic and neuronal nonlinearities are implemented with a second\nstage of Josephson circuitry. The hardware presents great design flexibility,\nwith demonstrated synaptic time constants spanning four orders of magnitude\n(hundreds of nanoseconds to milliseconds). The synapses are responsive to\npresynaptic spike rates exceeding 10 MHz and consume approximately 33 aJ of\ndynamic power per synapse event before accounting for cooling. In addition to\nneuromorphic hardware, these circuits introduce new avenues towards realizing\nlarge-scale single-photon-detector arrays for diverse imaging, sensing, and\nquantum communication applications.",
