This approach called SuperpixelGridMasks permits to\nextend original image datasets that are required by training stages of machine\nlearning-related analysis architectures towards increasing their performances.\nThree variants named SuperpixelGridCut, SuperpixelGridMean and\nSuperpixelGridMix are presented. These grid-based methods produce a new style\nof image transformations using the dropping and fusing of information.\nExtensive experiments using various image classification models and datasets\nshow that baseline performances can be significantly outperformed using our\nmethods. The comparative study also shows that our methods can overpass the\nperformances of other data augmentations. Experimental results obtained over\nimage recognition datasets of varied natures show the efficiency of these new\nmethods.

    "abstract": "This study compares different methods to predict the simultaneous effects of\nconductive and radiative heat transfer in a Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)\nsample. PMMA is a kind of polymer utilized in various sensors and actuator\ndevices. One-dimensional combined heat transfer is considered in numerical\nanalysis. Computer implementation was obtained for the numerical solution of\ngoverning equation with the implicit finite difference method in the case of\ndiscretization. Kirchhoff transformation was used to get data from a non-linear\nequation of conductive heat transfer by considering monochromatic radiation\nintensity and temperature conditions applied to the PMMA sample boundaries. For\nDeep Neural Network (DNN) method, the novel Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)\nmethod was introduced to find accurate results in the least processing time\nthan the numerical method. A recent study derived the combined heat transfers\nand their temperature profiles for the PMMA sample. Furthermore, the transient\ntemperature profile is validated by another study. A comparison proves a\nperfect agreement. It shows the temperature gradient in the primary positions\nthat makes a spectral amount of conductive heat transfer from a PMMA sample. It\nis more straightforward when they are compared with the novel DNN method.\nResults demonstrate that this artificial intelligence method is accurate and\nfast in predicting problems. By analyzing the results from the numerical\nsolution it can be understood that the conductive and radiative heat flux is\nsimilar in the case of gradient behavior, but it is also twice in its amount\napproximately. Hence, total heat flux has a constant value in an approximated\nsteady state condition. In addition to analyzing their composition, ROC curve\nand confusion matrix were implemented to evaluate the algorithm performance.",

    "abstract": "Recent research is trying to leverage occupants' demand in the building's\ncontrol loop to consider individuals' well-being and the buildings' energy\nsavings. To that end, a real-time feedback system is needed to provide data\nabout occupants' comfort conditions that can be used to control the building's\nheating, cooling, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The emergence of thermal\nimaging techniques provides an excellent opportunity for contactless data\ngathering with no interruption in occupant conditions and activities. There is\nincreasing attention to infrared thermal camera usage in public buildings\nbecause of their non-invasive quality in reading the human skin temperature.\nHowever, the state-of-the-art methods need additional modifications to become\nmore reliable. To capitalize potentials and address some existing limitations,\nnew solutions are required to bring a more holistic view toward non-intrusive\nthermal scanning by leveraging the benefit of machine learning and image\nprocessing. This research implements an automated approach to collect and\nregister simultaneous thermal and visual images and read the facial temperature\nin different regions. This paper also presents two additional investigations.\nFirst, through utilizing IButton wearable thermal sensors on the forehead area,\nwe investigate the reliability of an in-expensive thermal camera (FLIR Lepton)\nin reading the skin temperature. Second, by studying the false-color version of\nthermal images, we look into the possibility of non-radiometric thermal images\nfor predicting personalized thermal comfort. The results shows the strong\nperformance of Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor prediction algorithms in\npredicting personalized thermal comfort. In addition, we have found that\nnon-radiometric images can also indicate thermal comfort when the algorithm is\ntrained with larger amounts of data.",

    "abstract": "The weather phenomenon of frost poses great threats to agriculture. Since it\ndamages the crops and plants from upstream of the supply chain, the potential\nimpact of frosts is significant for agriculture-related industries. As recent\nfrost prediction methods are based on on-site historical data and sensors,\nextra development and deployment time are required for data collection in any\nnew site. The aim of this article is to eliminate the dependency on on-site\nhistorical data and sensors for frost prediction methods. In this article, a\nfrost prediction method based on spatial interpolation is proposed. The models\nuse climate data from existing weather stations, digital elevation models\nsurveys, and normalized difference vegetation index data to estimate a target\nsite's next hour minimum temperature. The proposed method utilizes ensemble\nlearning to increase the model accuracy. Ensemble methods include averaging and\nweighted averaging. Climate datasets are obtained from 75 weather stations\nacross New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory areas of Australia. The\nmodels are constructed with five-fold validation, splitting the weather\nstations into five testing dataset folds. For each fold, the other stations act\nas training datasets. After the models are constructed, three experiments are\nconducted. The first experiment compares the results generated by models\nbetween different folds. Then, the second experiment compares the accuracy of\ndifferent methods. The final experiment reveals the effect of available\nstations on the proposed models. The results show that the proposed method\nreached a detection rate up to 92.55%. This method could be implemented as an\nalternative solution when on-site historical datasets are scarce.",

Our workshop with two\nindustrial assessors revealed that a computational system that can extract\nnonverbal cues of assesses from interview videos would be beneficial to\nassessors in terms of supporting their decision making. In response, we\ndeveloped such a system based on an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm\nusing multimodal behavioral features such as facial keypoints, pose, head pose,\nand gaze. Moreover, we enabled the system to output how much each feature\ncontributed to the outlierness of the detected cues with the purpose of\nenhancing its interpretability. We then conducted a preliminary study to\nexamine the validity of the system's output by using 20 actual assessment\ninterview videos and involving the two assessors. The results suggested the\nadvantages of using unsupervised anomaly detection in an interpretable manner\nby illustrating the informativeness of its outputs for assessors. Our approach,\nwhich builds on top of the idea of separation of observation and interpretation\nin human-AI teaming, will facilitate human decision making in highly contextual\ndomains, such as human assessment, while keeping their trust in the system.",

These images are generated with a latent vector\nthat is progressively refined to agree with text cues. To do so, patches are\nsampled within the generated image, and compared with the text prompts in the\ncommon text-image embedding space; The latent vector is then updated, using\ngradient descent, to reduce the mean (average) distance between these patches\nand text cues. While this approach provides artists with ample freedom to\ncustomize the overall appearance of images, through their choice in generative\nmodels, the reliance on a simple criterion (mean of distances) often causes\nmode collapse: The entire image is drawn to the average of all text cues,\nthereby losing their diversity. To address this issue, we propose using\nmatching techniques found in the optimal transport (OT) literature, resulting\nin images that are able to reflect faithfully a wide diversity of prompts. We\nprovide numerous illustrations showing that OT avoids some of the pitfalls\narising from estimating vectors with mean distances, and demonstrate the\ncapacity of our proposed method to perform better in experiments, qualitatively\nand quantitatively.",

    "abstract": "Evaluation of keyword spotting (KWS) systems that detect keywords in speech\nis a challenging task under realistic privacy constraints. The KWS is designed\nto only collect data when the keyword is present, limiting the availability of\nhard samples that may contain false negatives, and preventing direct estimation\nof model recall from production data. Alternatively, complementary data\ncollected from other sources may not be fully representative of the real\napplication. In this work, we propose an evaluation technique which we call\nAB/BA analysis. Our framework evaluates a candidate KWS model B against a\nbaseline model A, using cross-dataset offline decoding for relative recall\nestimation, without requiring negative examples. Moreover, we propose a\nformulation with assumptions that allow estimation of relative false positive\nrate between models with low variance even when the number of false positives\nis small. Finally, we propose to leverage machine-generated soft labels, in a\ntechnique we call Semi-Supervised AB/BA analysis, that improves the analysis\ntime, privacy, and cost. Experiments with both simulation and real data show\nthat AB/BA analysis is successful at measuring recall improvement in\nconjunction with the trade-off in relative false positive rate.",

    "abstract": "Embodied AI is a recent research area that aims at creating intelligent\nagents that can move and operate inside an environment. Existing approaches in\nthis field demand the agents to act in completely new and unexplored scenes.\nHowever, this setting is far from realistic use cases that instead require\nexecuting multiple tasks in the same environment. Even if the environment\nchanges over time, the agent could still count on its global knowledge about\nthe scene while trying to adapt its internal representation to the current\nstate of the environment. To make a step towards this setting, we propose Spot\nthe Difference: a novel task for Embodied AI where the agent has access to an\noutdated map of the environment and needs to recover the correct layout in a\nfixed time budget. To this end, we collect a new dataset of occupancy maps\nstarting from existing datasets of 3D spaces and generating a number of\npossible layouts for a single environment. This dataset can be employed in the\npopular Habitat simulator and is fully compliant with existing methods that\nemploy reconstructed occupancy maps during navigation. Furthermore, we propose\nan exploration policy that can take advantage of previous knowledge of the\nenvironment and identify changes in the scene faster and more effectively than\nexisting agents. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art models for exploration on this new\nsetting.",

    "abstract": "Given entities and their interactions in the web data, which may have\noccurred at different time, how can we find communities of entities and track\ntheir evolution? In this paper, we approach this important task from graph\nclustering perspective. Recently, state-of-the-art clustering performance in\nvarious domains has been achieved by deep clustering methods. Especially, deep\ngraph clustering (DGC) methods have successfully extended deep clustering to\ngraph-structured data by learning node representations and cluster assignments\nin a joint optimization framework. Despite some differences in modeling choices\n(e.g., encoder architectures), existing DGC methods are mainly based on\nautoencoders and use the same clustering objective with relatively minor\nadaptations. Also, while many real-world graphs are dynamic, previous DGC\nmethods considered only static graphs. In this work, we develop CGC, a novel\nend-to-end framework for graph clustering, which fundamentally differs from\nexisting methods. CGC learns node embeddings and cluster assignments in a\ncontrastive graph learning framework, where positive and negative samples are\ncarefully selected in a multi-level scheme such that they reflect hierarchical\ncommunity structures and network homophily. Also, we extend CGC for\ntime-evolving data, where temporal graph clustering is performed in an\nincremental learning fashion, with the ability to detect change points.\nExtensive evaluation on real-world graphs demonstrates that the proposed CGC\nconsistently outperforms existing methods.",

We show that gender diversity requires\ninclusion to lead to benefits in creativity by analyzing teams in 4011 video\ngame projects. Recording data on the weighted network from past collaborations,\nwe developed four measures of inclusion, depending on a lack of segregation,\nstrong ties across genders, and the incorporation of women into the core of the\nteam s network. We found that gender diversity without inclusion does not\ncontribute to creativity, while with maximal inclusion one standard deviation\nchange in diversity results in .04 to .09 standard deviation change in\ncreativity, depending on the measure of inclusion. To reap creative benefits of\ndiversity, developer firms need to include 23 percent or more female developers\n(as opposed to the 15 percent mean female proportion) and include them in the\nteam along all dimensions. Inclusion at low diversity has a negative effect. By\nanalyzing the sequences of diversity and inclusion across games within firms,\nwe found that adding diversity first, and developing inclusion later can lead\nto higher diversity and inclusion, compared to adding female developers with\nalready existing cross-gender ties to the team.",

A\nnovel idea with our approach is the use of single-time step snapshots from the\nsystem states taken from an estimation of the reduced-state space.

    "abstract": "In the last decade, information diffusion (also known as information cascade)\non social networks has been massively investigated due to its application\nvalues in many fields. In recent years, many sequential models including those\nmodels based on recurrent neural networks have been broadly employed to predict\ninformation cascade. However, the user dependencies in a cascade sequence\ncaptured by sequential models are generally unidirectional and inconsistent\nwith diffusion trees. For example, the true trigger of a successor may be a\nnon-immediate predecessor rather than the immediate predecessor in the\nsequence. To capture user dependencies more sufficiently which are crucial to\nprecise cascade modeling, we propose a non-sequential information cascade model\nnamed as TAN-DRUD (Topology-aware Attention Networks with Dual Role User\nDependency). TAN-DRUD obtains satisfactory performance on information cascade\nmodeling through capturing the dual role user dependencies of information\nsender and receiver, which is inspired by the classic communication theory.\nFurthermore, TANDRUD incorporates social topology into two-level attention\nnetworks for enhanced information diffusion prediction. Our extensive\nexperiments on three cascade datasets demonstrate that our model is not only\nsuperior to the state-of-the-art cascade models, but also capable of exploiting\ntopology information and inferring diffusion trees.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge bases (KBs) are often incomplete and constantly changing in\npractice. Yet, in many question answering applications coupled with knowledge\nbases, the sparse nature of KBs is often overlooked. To this end, we propose a\ncase-based reasoning approach, CBR-iKB, for knowledge base question answering\n(KBQA) with incomplete-KB as our main focus. Our method ensembles decisions\nfrom multiple reasoning chains with a novel nonparametric reasoning algorithm.\nBy design, CBR-iKB can seamlessly adapt to changes in KBs without any\ntask-specific training or fine-tuning. Our method achieves 100% accuracy on\nMetaQA and establishes new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks. For\ninstance, CBR-iKB achieves an accuracy of 70% on WebQSP under the incomplete-KB\nsetting, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art method by 22.3%.",

    "abstract": "A Physics-Informed Dynamic Graph Neural Network (PIDGeuN) is presented to\naccurately, efficiently and robustly predict the nonlinear transient dynamics\nof microgrids in the presence of disturbances. The graph-based architecture of\nPIDGeuN provides a natural representation of the microgrid topology. Using only\nthe state information that is practically measurable, PIDGeuN employs a time\ndelay embedding formulation to fully reproduce the system dynamics, avoiding\nthe dependency of conventional methods on internal dynamic states such as\ncontrollers. Based on a judiciously designed message passing mechanism, the\nPIDGeuN incorporates two physics-informed techniques to improve its prediction\nperformance, including a physics-data-infusion approach to determining the\ninter-dependencies between buses, and a loss term to respect the known physical\nlaw of the power system, i.e., the Kirchhoff's law, to ensure the feasibility\nof the model prediction. Extensive tests show that PIDGeuN can provide accurate\nand robust prediction of transient dynamics for nonlinear microgrids over a\nlong-term time period. Therefore, the PIDGeuN offers a potent tool for the\nmodeling of large scale networked microgrids (NMs), with potential applications\nto predictive or preventive control in real time applications for the stable\nand resilient operations of NMs.",

    "abstract": "Image outpainting gains increasing attention since it can generate the\ncomplete scene from a partial view, providing a valuable solution to construct\n360{\\deg} panoramic images. As image outpainting suffers from the intrinsic\nissue of unidirectional completion flow, previous methods convert the original\nproblem into inpainting, which allows a bidirectional flow. However, we find\nthat inpainting has its own limitations and is inferior to outpainting in\ncertain situations. The question of how they may be combined for the best of\nboth has as yet remained under-explored. In this paper, we provide a deep\nanalysis of the differences between inpainting and outpainting, which\nessentially depends on how the source pixels contribute to the unknown regions\nunder different spatial arrangements. Motivated by this analysis, we present a\nCylin-Painting framework that involves meaningful collaborations between\ninpainting and outpainting and efficiently fuses the different arrangements,\nwith a view to leveraging their complementary benefits on a consistent and\nseamless cylinder. Nevertheless, directly applying the cylinder-style\nconvolution often generates visually unpleasing results as it could discard\nimportant positional information. To address this issue, we further present a\nlearnable positional embedding strategy and incorporate the missing component\nof positional encoding into the cylinder convolution, which significantly\nimproves the panoramic results. Note that while developed for image\noutpainting, the proposed solution can be effectively extended to other\npanoramic vision tasks, such as object detection, depth estimation, and image\nsuper resolution.",

    "abstract": "We study online convex optimization with switching costs, a practically\nimportant but also extremely challenging problem due to the lack of complete\noffline information. By tapping into the power of machine learning (ML) based\noptimizers, ML-augmented online algorithms (also referred to as expert\ncalibration in this paper) have been emerging as state of the art, with\nprovable worst-case performance guarantees. Nonetheless, by using the standard\npractice of training an ML model as a standalone optimizer and plugging it into\nan ML-augmented algorithm, the average cost performance can be even worse than\npurely using ML predictions. In order to address the \"how to learn\" challenge,\nwe propose EC-L2O (expert-calibrated learning to optimize), which trains an\nML-based optimizer by explicitly taking into account the downstream expert\ncalibrator. To accomplish this, we propose a new differentiable expert\ncalibrator that generalizes regularized online balanced descent and offers a\nprovably better competitive ratio than pure ML predictions when the prediction\nerror is large. For training, our loss function is a weighted sum of two\ndifferent losses -- one minimizing the average ML prediction error for better\nrobustness, and the other one minimizing the post-calibration average cost. We\nalso provide theoretical analysis for EC-L2O, highlighting that expert\ncalibration can be even beneficial for the average cost performance and that\nthe high-percentile tail ratio of the cost achieved by EC-L2O to that of the\noffline optimal oracle (i.e., tail cost ratio) can be bounded. Finally, we test\nEC-L2O by running simulations for sustainable datacenter demand response. Our\nresults demonstrate that EC-L2O can empirically achieve a lower average cost as\nwell as a lower competitive ratio than the existing baseline algorithms.",

The framework, called GenRL, trains deep\npolicies by introducing an action latent variable such that the feed-forward\npolicy search can be divided into two parts: (i) training a sub-policy that\noutputs a distribution over the action latent variable given a state of the\nsystem, and (ii) unsupervised training of a generative model that outputs a\nsequence of motor actions conditioned on the latent action variable.

Moreover, we\nprovide a set of measures for evaluation of generative models such that we are\nable to predict the performance of the RL policy training prior to the actual\ntraining on a physical robot. We experimentally determine the characteristics\nof generative models that have most influence on the performance of the final\npolicy training on two robotics tasks: shooting a hockey puck and throwing a\nbasketball.

    "abstract": "Due to the current horizontal business model that promotes increasing\nreliance on untrusted third-party Intellectual Properties (IPs), CAD tools, and\ndesign facilities, hardware Trojan attacks have become a serious threat to the\nsemiconductor industry. Development of effective countermeasures against\nhardware Trojan attacks requires: (1) fast and reliable exploration of the\nviable Trojan attack space for a given design and (2) a suite of high-quality\nTrojan-inserted benchmarks that meet specific standards. The latter has become\nessential for the development and evaluation of design/verification solutions\nto achieve quantifiable assurance against Trojan attacks. While existing static\nbenchmarks provide a baseline for comparing different countermeasures, they\nonly enumerate a limited number of handcrafted Trojans from the complete Trojan\ndesign space. To accomplish these dual objectives, in this paper, we present\nMIMIC, a novel AI-guided framework for automatic Trojan insertion, which can\ncreate a large population of valid Trojans for a given design by mimicking the\nproperties of a small set of known Trojans. While there exist tools to\nautomatically insert Trojan instances using fixed Trojan templates, they cannot\nanalyze known Trojan attacks for creating new instances that accurately capture\nthe threat model. MIMIC works in two major steps: (1) it analyzes structural\nand functional features of existing Trojan populations in a multi-dimensional\nspace to train machine learning models and generate a large number of \"virtual\nTrojans\" of the given design, (2) next, it binds them into the design by\nmatching their functional/structural properties with suitable nets of the\ninternal logic structure. We have developed a complete tool flow for MIMIC,\nextensively evaluated the framework by exploring several use-cases, and\nquantified its effectiveness to demonstrate highly promising results.",

    "title": "INFOrmation Prioritization through EmPOWERment in Visual Model-Based RL",
    "abstract": "Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms designed for handling\ncomplex visual observations typically learn some sort of latent state\nrepresentation, either explicitly or implicitly. Standard methods of this sort\ndo not distinguish between functionally relevant aspects of the state and\nirrelevant distractors, instead aiming to represent all available information\nequally. We propose a modified objective for model-based RL that, in\ncombination with mutual information maximization, allows us to learn\nrepresentations and dynamics for visual model-based RL without reconstruction\nin a way that explicitly prioritizes functionally relevant factors. The key\nprinciple behind our design is to integrate a term inspired by variational\nempowerment into a state-space model based on mutual information. This term\nprioritizes information that is correlated with action, thus ensuring that\nfunctionally relevant factors are captured first. Furthermore, the same\nempowerment term also promotes faster exploration during the RL process,\nespecially for sparse-reward tasks where the reward signal is insufficient to\ndrive exploration in the early stages of learning. We evaluate the approach on\na suite of vision-based robot control tasks with natural video backgrounds, and\nshow that the proposed prioritized information objective outperforms\nstate-of-the-art model based RL approaches with higher sample efficiency and\nepisodic returns. https://sites.google.com/view/information-empowerment",

    "abstract": "The most common sensing modalities found in a robot perception system are\nvision and touch, which together can provide global and highly localized data\nfor manipulation. However, these sensing modalities often fail to adequately\ncapture the behavior of target objects during the critical moments as they\ntransition out of static, controlled contact with an end-effector to dynamic\nand uncontrolled motion. In this work, we present a novel multimodal\nvisuotactile sensor that provides simultaneous visuotactile and proximity depth\ndata. The sensor integrates an RGB camera and air pressure sensor to sense\ntouch with an infrared time-of-flight (ToF) camera to sense proximity by\nleveraging a selectively transmissive soft membrane to enable the dual sensing\nmodalities. We present the mechanical design, fabrication techniques, algorithm\nimplementations, and evaluation of the sensor's tactile and proximity\nmodalities. The sensor is demonstrated in three open-loop robotic tasks:\napproaching and contacting an object, catching, and throwing. The fusion of\ntactile and proximity data could be used to capture key information about a\ntarget object's transition behavior for sensor-based control in dynamic\nmanipulation.",

    "abstract": "Crime has become a major concern in many cities, which calls for the rising\ndemand for timely predicting citywide crime occurrence. Accurate crime\nprediction results are vital for the beforehand decision-making of government\nto alleviate the increasing concern about the public safety. While many efforts\nhave been devoted to proposing various spatial-temporal forecasting techniques\nto explore dependence across locations and time periods, most of them follow a\nsupervised learning manner, which limits their spatial-temporal representation\nability on sparse crime data. Inspired by the recent success in self-supervised\nlearning, this work proposes a Spatial-Temporal Hypergraph Self-Supervised\nLearning framework (ST-HSL) to tackle the label scarcity issue in crime\nprediction. Specifically, we propose the cross-region hypergraph structure\nlearning to encode region-wise crime dependency under the entire urban space.\nFurthermore, we design the dual-stage self-supervised learning paradigm, to not\nonly jointly capture local- and global-level spatial-temporal crime patterns,\nbut also supplement the sparse crime representation by augmenting region\nself-discrimination. We perform extensive experiments on two real-life crime\ndatasets. Evaluation results show that our ST-HSL significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis provides insights into the\nsuperiority of our ST-HSL method in the representation of spatial-temporal\ncrime patterns.

    "abstract": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) is the most common vulnerability class in web\napplications over the last decade. Much research attention has focused on\nbuilding exploit mitigation defenses for this problem, but no technique\nprovides adequate protection in the face of advanced attacks. One technique\nthat bypasses XSS mitigations is the scriptless attack: a content injection\ntechnique that uses (among other options) CSS and HTML injection to infiltrate\ndata. In studying this technique and others, we realized that the common\nproperty among the exploitation of all content injection vulnerabilities,\nincluding not just XSS and scriptless attacks, but also command injections and\nseveral others, is an unintended context switch in the victim program's parsing\nengine that is caused by untrusted user input.\nIn this paper, we propose Context-Auditor, a novel technique that leverages\nthis insight to identify content injection vulnerabilities ranging from XSS to\nscriptless attacks and command injections. We implemented Context-Auditor as a\ngeneral solution to content injection exploit detection problem in the form of\na flexible, stand-alone detection module. We deployed instances of\nContext-Auditor as (1) a browser plugin, (2) a web proxy (3) a web server\nplugin, and (4) as a wrapper around potentially-injectable system endpoints.\nBecause Context-Auditor targets the root cause of content injection\nexploitation (and, more specifically for the purpose of our prototype, XSS\nexploitation, scriptless exploitation, and command injection), our evaluation\nresults demonstrate that Context-Auditor can identify and block content\ninjection exploits that modern defenses cannot while maintaining low throughput\noverhead and avoiding false positives.",

    "abstract": "Video-based programming tutorials are a popular form of tutorial used by\nauthors to guide learners to code. Still, the interactivity of these videos is\nlimited primarily to control video flow. There are existing works with\nincreased interactivity that are shown to improve the learning experience.\nStill, these solutions require setting up a custom recording environment and\nare not well-integrated with the playback environment. This paper describes our\nintegrated ITSS environment and evaluates the ease of authoring and playback of\nour interactive programming tutorials. Our environment is designed to run\nwithin the browser sandbox and is less intrusive to record interactivity\nactions. We develop a recording approach that tracks the author's interactivity\nactions (e.g., typing code, highlighting words, scrolling panels) on the\nbrowser and stored in text and audio formats. We replay these actions using the\nrecorded artefacts for learners to have a more interactive, integrated and\nrealistic playback of the author's actions instead of watching video frames.\nOur design goals are 1) efficient recording and playback, 2) extensible\ninteractivity features to help students learn better, and 3) a scalable\nweb-based environment. Our first user study of 20 participants who carry out\nthe author tasks agree that it is efficient and easy to author interactive\nvideos in our environment with no additional software needed. Our second user\nstudy of 84 students using the environment agrees that the increased\ninteractivity can help them learn better over a video-based tutorial. Our\nperformance test shows that the environment can scale to support up to 500\nconcurrent users.

Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution\n(CTDE) in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is a promising method for\nmulti-UAV collision avoidance, in which the key challenge is to effectively\nlearn decentralized policies that can maximize a global reward cooperatively.\nWe propose a new multi-agent critic-actor learning scheme called MACA for UAV\nswarm collision avoidance.

To solve\nthe credit assignment problem in CTDE, we design a counterfactual baseline that\nmarginalizes both an agent's state and action, enabling to evaluate the\nimportance of an agent in the joint observation-action space. To train and\nevaluate MACA, we design our own simulation environment MACAEnv to closely\nmimic the realistic behaviors of a UAV swarm. Simulation results show that MACA\nachieves more than 16% higher average reward than two state-of-the-art MARL\nalgorithms and reduces failure rate by 90% and response time by over 99%\ncompared to a conventional UAV swarm collision avoidance algorithm in all test\nscenarios.",

There are\ngrowing concerns that deepfakes can be maliciously used to create misleading\nand harmful digital contents. As deepfakes become more common, there is a dire\nneed for deepfake detection technology to help spot deepfake media. Present\ndeepfake detection models are able to achieve outstanding accuracy (>90%).\nHowever, most of them are limited to within-dataset scenario, where the same\ndataset is used for training and testing.

However, many of these methods only focus on cross-corpus\nSER without addressing the cross-language SER performance degradation due to a\nlarger domain gap between source and target language data. This contribution\nproposes an adversarial dual discriminator (ADDi) network that uses the\nthree-players adversarial game to learn generalised representations without\nrequiring any target data labels. We also introduce a self-supervised ADDi\n(sADDi) network that utilises self-supervised pre-training with unlabelled\ndata. We propose synthetic data generation as a pretext task in sADDi, enabling\nthe network to produce emotionally discriminative and domain invariant\nrepresentations and providing complementary synthetic data to augment the\nsystem. The proposed model is rigorously evaluated using five publicly\navailable datasets in three languages and compared with multiple studies on\ncross-corpus and cross-language SER. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed model achieves improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the color image completion problem in accordance with\nlow-rank quatenrion matrix optimization that is characterized by sparse\nregularization in a transformed domain. This research was inspired by an\nappreciation of the fact that different signal types, including audio formats\nand images, possess structures that are inherently sparse in respect of their\nrespective bases. Since color images can be processed as a whole in the\nquaternion domain, we depicted the sparsity of the color image in the\nquaternion discrete cosine transform (QDCT) domain. In addition, the\nrepresentation of a low-rank structure that is intrinsic to the color image is\na vital issue in the quaternion matrix completion problem. To achieve a more\nsuperior low-rank approximation, the quatenrion-based truncated nuclear norm\n(QTNN) is employed in the proposed model. Moreover, this model is facilitated\nby a competent alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based on the\nalgorithm. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method\ncan yield vastly superior completion performance in comparison with the\nstate-of-the-art low-rank matrix/quaternion matrix approximation methods tested\non color image recovery.",

    "abstract": "For autonomous quadruped robot navigation in various complex environments, a\ntypical SOTA system is composed of four main modules -- mapper, global planner,\nlocal planner, and command-tracking controller -- in a hierarchical manner. In\nthis paper, we build a robust and safe local planner which is designed to\ngenerate a velocity plan to track a coarsely planned path from the global\nplanner. Previous works used waypoint-based methods (e.g.\nProportional-Differential control and pure pursuit) which simplify the path\ntracking problem to local point-goal navigation. However, they suffer from\nfrequent collisions in geometrically complex and narrow environments because of\ntwo reasons; the global planner uses a coarse and inaccurate model and the\nlocal planner is unable to track the global plan sufficiently well. Currently,\ndeep learning methods are an appealing alternative because they can learn\nsafety and path feasibility from experience more accurately. However, existing\ndeep learning methods are not capable of planning for a long horizon. In this\nwork, we propose a learning-based fully autonomous navigation framework\ncomposed of three innovative elements: a learned forward dynamics model (FDM),\nan online sampling-based model-predictive controller, and an informed\ntrajectory sampler (ITS). Using our framework, a quadruped robot can\nautonomously navigate in various complex environments without a collision and\ngenerate a smoother command plan compared to the baseline method.

LitCovid, a literature database of COVID-19 related papers in PubMed,\nhas accumulated over 180,000 articles with millions of accesses. Approximately\n10,000 new articles are added to LitCovid every month. A main curation task in\nLitCovid is topic annotation where an article is assigned with up to eight\ntopics, e.g., Treatment and Diagnosis. The annotated topics have been widely\nused both in LitCovid (e.g., accounting for ~18% of total uses) and downstream\nstudies such as network generation.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new state transfer method for geographic state machine\nreplication (SMR) that dynamically allocates the state to be transferred among\nreplicas according to changes in communication bandwidths. SMR improves fault\ntolerance by replicating a service to multiple replicas. When a replica is\nnewly added or recovered from a failure, the other replicas transfer the\ncurrent state of the service to it. However, in geographic SMR, the\ncommunication bandwidths of replicas are different and constantly changing.\nTherefore, existing state transfer methods cannot fully utilize the available\nbandwidth, and their state transfer time increases. To overcome this problem,\nour method divides the state into multiple chunks and assigns them to replicas\nbased on each replica's bandwidth so that the broader a replica's bandwidth is,\nthe more chunks it transfers. The proposed method also updates the chunk\nassignment of each replica dynamically based on the currently estimated\nbandwidth. The performance evaluation on Amazon EC2 shows that the proposed\nmethod reduces the state transfer time by up to 47% compared to the existing\none. In addition, we apply the proposed method to dynamic replacement of\nreplicas, which can mitigate latency degradation caused by network trouble, and\nevaluate how fast the method can relocate a replica.",

Based on this mechanism, molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations have been invented as a useful tool to investigate the dynamical\nproperties of this molecular system. However, the computational expenditure\nprohibits the growth of reported protein trajectories. To address this\ninsufficiency, we present a novel spatial-temporal pre-training protocol,\nPretrainMD, to grant the protein encoder the capacity to capture the\ntime-dependent geometric mobility along MD trajectories. Specifically, we\nintroduce two sorts of self-supervised learning tasks: an atom-level denoising\ngenerative task and a protein-level snapshot ordering task. We validate the\neffectiveness of PretrainMD through the PDBbind dataset for both linear-probing\nand fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that our PretrainMD exceeds most\nstate-of-the-art methods and achieves comparable performance. More importantly,\nthrough visualization we discover that the learned representations by\npre-training on MD trajectories without any label from the downstream task\nfollow similar patterns of the magnitude of binding affinities. This strongly\naligns with the fact that the motion of the interactions of protein and ligand\nmaintains the key information of their binding.

However, it is particularly difficult, mainly due to the\npresence of Byzantine processes that act arbitrarily and the unknown message\ndelays in general networks.\nAlthough it is well known that both safety and liveness are at risk as soon\nas $n/3$ Byzantine processes fail, very few works attempted to characterize\nprecisely the faults that produce safety violations from the faults that\nproduce termination violations.\nIn this paper, we present a new lower bound on the solvability of the\nconsensus problem by distinguishing deceitful faults violating safety and\nbenign faults violating termination from the more general Byzantine faults, in\nwhat we call the Byzantine-deceitful-benign fault model. We show that one\ncannot solve consensus if $n\\leq 3t+d+2q$ with $t$ Byzantine processes, $d$\ndeceitful processes, and $q$ benign processes.\nIn addition, we show that this bound is tight by presenting the Basilic class\nof consensus protocols that solve consensus when $n > 3t+d+2q$. These protocols\ndiffer in the number of processes from which they wait to receive messages\nbefore progressing. Each of these protocols is thus better suited for some\napplications depending on the predominance of benign or deceitful faults.\nFinally, we study the fault tolerance of the Basilic class of consensus\nprotocols in the context of blockchains that need to solve the weaker problem\nof eventual consensus. We demonstrate that Basilic solves this problem with\nonly $n > 2t+d+q$, hence demonstrating how it can strengthen blockchain\nsecurity.",

    "title": "ActAR: Actor-Driven Pose Embeddings for Video Action Recognition",
    "abstract": "Human action recognition (HAR) in videos is one of the core tasks of video\nunderstanding. Based on video sequences, the goal is to recognize actions\nperformed by humans. While HAR has received much attention in the visible\nspectrum, action recognition in infrared videos is little studied. Accurate\nrecognition of human actions in the infrared domain is a highly challenging\ntask because of the redundant and indistinguishable texture features present in\nthe sequence. Furthermore, in some cases, challenges arise from the irrelevant\ninformation induced by the presence of multiple active persons not contributing\nto the actual action of interest. Therefore, most existing methods consider a\nstandard paradigm that does not take into account these challenges, which is in\nsome part due to the ambiguous definition of the recognition task in some\ncases. In this paper, we propose a new method that simultaneously learns to\nrecognize efficiently human actions in the infrared spectrum, while\nautomatically identifying the key-actors performing the action without using\nany prior knowledge or explicit annotations. Our method is composed of three\nstages. In the first stage, optical flow-based key-actor identification is\nperformed. Then for each key-actor, we estimate key-poses that will guide the\nframe selection process. A scale-invariant encoding process along with embedded\npose filtering are performed in order to enhance the quality of action\nrepresentations. Experimental results on InfAR dataset show that our proposed\nmodel achieves promising recognition performance and learns useful action\nrepresentations.",

    "title": "A Score-based Geometric Model for Molecular Dynamics Simulations",
    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) has long been the \\emph{de facto} choice for modeling\ncomplex atomistic systems from first principles, and recently deep learning\nbecome a popular way to accelerate it. Notwithstanding, preceding approaches\ndepend on intermediate variables such as the potential energy or force fields\nto update atomic positions, which requires additional computations to perform\nback-propagation. To waive this requirement, we propose a novel model called\nScoreMD by directly estimating the gradient of the log density of molecular\nconformations. Moreover, we analyze that diffusion processes highly accord with\nthe principle of enhanced sampling in MD simulations, and is therefore a\nperfect match to our sequential conformation generation task. That is, ScoreMD\nperturbs the molecular structure with a conditional noise depending on atomic\naccelerations and employs conformations at previous timeframes as the prior\ndistribution for sampling. Another challenge of modeling such a conformation\ngeneration process is that the molecule is kinetic instead of static, which no\nprior studies strictly consider. To solve this challenge, we introduce a\nequivariant geometric Transformer as a score function in the diffusion process\nto calculate the corresponding gradient. It incorporates the directions and\nvelocities of atomic motions via 3D spherical Fourier-Bessel representations.\nWith multiple architectural improvements, we outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines on MD17 and isomers of C7O2H10. This research provides new insights\ninto the acceleration of new material and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "In the upcoming 6G era, existing terrestrial networks have evolved toward\nspace-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN), providing ultra-high data rates,\nseamless network coverage, and ubiquitous intelligence for communications of\napplications and services. However, conventional communications in SAGIN still\nface data confidentiality issues. Fortunately, the concept of Quantum Key\nDistribution (QKD) over SAGIN is able to provide information-theoretic security\nfor secure communications in SAGIN with quantum cryptography. Therefore, in\nthis paper, we propose the quantum-secured SAGIN which is feasible to achieve\nproven secure communications using quantum mechanics to protect data channels\nbetween space, air, and ground nodes. Moreover, we propose a universal QKD\nservice provisioning framework to minimize the cost of QKD services under the\nuncertainty and dynamics of communications in quantum-secured SAGIN. In this\nframework, fiber-based QKD services are deployed in passive optical networks\nwith the advantages of low loss and high stability. Moreover, the widely\ncovered and flexible satellite- and UAV-based QKD services are provisioned as a\nsupplement during the real-time data transmission phase. Finally, to examine\nthe effectiveness of the proposed concept and framework, a case study of\nquantum-secured SAGIN in the Metaverse is conducted where uncertain and dynamic\nfactors of the secure communications in Metaverse applications are effectively\nresolved in the proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "Vision transformers have achieved great successes in many computer vision\ntasks. Most methods generate vision tokens by splitting an image into a regular\nand fixed grid and treating each cell as a token. However, not all regions are\nequally important in human-centric vision tasks, e.g., the human body needs a\nfine representation with many tokens, while the image background can be modeled\nby a few tokens. To address this problem, we propose a novel Vision\nTransformer, called Token Clustering Transformer (TCFormer), which merges\ntokens by progressive clustering, where the tokens can be merged from different\nlocations with flexible shapes and sizes. The tokens in TCFormer can not only\nfocus on important areas but also adjust the token shapes to fit the semantic\nconcept and adopt a fine resolution for regions containing critical details,\nwhich is beneficial to capturing detailed information. Extensive experiments\nshow that TCFormer consistently outperforms its counterparts on different\nchallenging human-centric tasks and datasets, including whole-body pose\nestimation on COCO-WholeBody and 3D human mesh reconstruction on 3DPW.

    "abstract": "Adverse events are a serious issue in drug development and many prediction\nmethods using machine learning have been developed. The random split\ncross-validation is the de facto standard for model building and evaluation in\nmachine learning, but care should be taken in adverse event prediction because\nthis approach tends to be overoptimistic compared with the real-world\nsituation. The time split, which uses the time axis, is considered suitable for\nreal-world prediction. However, the differences in model performance obtained\nusing the time and random splits are not fully understood. To understand the\ndifferences, we compared the model performance between the time and random\nsplits using eight types of compound information as input, eight adverse events\nas targets, and six machine learning algorithms. The random split showed higher\narea under the curve values than did the time split for six of eight targets.\nThe chemical spaces of the training and test datasets of the time split were\nsimilar, suggesting that the concept of applicability domain is insufficient to\nexplain the differences derived from the splitting. The area under the curve\ndifferences were smaller for the protein interaction than for the other\ndatasets. Subsequent detailed analyses suggested the danger of confounding in\nthe use of knowledge-based information in the time split. These findings\nindicate the importance of understanding the differences between the time and\nrandom splits in adverse event prediction and suggest that appropriate use of\nthe splitting strategies and interpretation of results are necessary for the\nreal-world prediction of adverse events.",

    "title": "CTCNet: A CNN-Transformer Cooperation Network for Face Image  Super-Resolution",
    "abstract": "Recently, deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) steered face\nsuper-resolution methods have achieved great progress in restoring degraded\nfacial details by jointly training with facial priors. However, these methods\nhave some obvious limitations. On the one hand, multi-task joint learning\nrequires additional marking on the dataset, and the introduced prior network\nwill significantly increase the computational cost of the model. On the other\nhand, the limited receptive field of CNN will reduce the fidelity and\nnaturalness of the reconstructed facial images, resulting in suboptimal\nreconstructed images. In this work, we propose an efficient CNN-Transformer\nCooperation Network (CTCNet) for face super-resolution tasks, which uses the\nmulti-scale connected encoder-decoder architecture as the backbone.\nSpecifically, we first devise a novel Local-Global Feature Cooperation Module\n(LGCM), which is composed of a Facial Structure Attention Unit (FSAU) and a\nTransformer block, to promote the consistency of local facial detail and global\nfacial structure restoration simultaneously. Then, we design an efficient Local\nFeature Refinement Module (LFRM) to enhance the local facial structure\ninformation. Finally, to further improve the restoration of fine facial\ndetails, we present a Multi-scale Feature Fusion Unit (MFFU) to adaptively fuse\nthe features from different stages in the encoder procedure. Comprehensive\nevaluations on various datasets have assessed that the proposed CTCNet can\noutperform other state-of-the-art methods significantly.",

    "abstract": "Social media has been known to be a hotbed of political and social\ncommunications and analyzing the polarization of opinions has been gaining\nattention. In this study, we have proposed a measure for quantifying\npolarization on social networks. The proposed metric, unlike state-of-the-art\nmethods, does not assume a two-opinion scenario and applies to multiple\nopinions. Our metric was tested on both binary opinion based benchmark networks\nas well as synthetically opinion-labeled social networks with a multi-opinion\nscenario and varying degrees of polarization. The metric showed promising\nresults for social networks with different levels of polarization. The method\nwas then employed to study polarization using data obtained from Twitter\nconcerning the tri-opinion (\"pro\", \"anti\" and \"neutral\") based communications\nregarding the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in India.\nWe have measured the polarization on a variety of social networks such as\ncommunication networks based on retweets or mentions, a social relationships\nnetwork based on follower-followee connections and finally hybrid networks by\ncombining the communication networks with the social relationships network. The\nproposed method suggested a high level of polarization among the users with\nrespect to sharing posts on Twitter, thereby indicating the highly contentious\nnature of the issue. We also obtained a high polarization score for a social\nrelationships network. Thus indicating the presence of homophily among users\ni.e. opinion on CAA is in-line with their social relationships on the platform.\nFor a retweet based hybrid network, the scores returned by our polarization\nmetric highlighted opinion to be the key driver in retweeting behaviour\nirrespective of the social relationships among users. On the contrary, the\nmention based communications among the users were not polarized in nature.",

    "abstract": "The development of cross-modal retrieval systems that can search and retrieve\nsemantically relevant data across different modalities based on a query in any\nmodality has attracted great attention in remote sensing (RS). In this paper,\nwe focus our attention on cross-modal text-image retrieval, where queries from\none modality (e.g., text) can be matched to archive entries from another (e.g.,\nimage). Most of the existing cross-modal text-image retrieval systems in RS\nrequire a high number of labeled training samples and also do not allow fast\nand memory-efficient retrieval. These issues limit the applicability of the\nexisting cross-modal retrieval systems for large-scale applications in RS. To\naddress this problem, in this paper we introduce a novel unsupervised\ncross-modal contrastive hashing (DUCH) method for text-image retrieval in RS.\nTo this end, the proposed DUCH is made up of two main modules: 1) feature\nextraction module, which extracts deep representations of two modalities; 2)\nhashing module that learns to generate cross-modal binary hash codes from the\nextracted representations. We introduce a novel multi-objective loss function\nincluding: i) contrastive objectives that enable similarity preservation in\nintra- and inter-modal similarities; ii) an adversarial objective that is\nenforced across two modalities for cross-modal representation consistency; and\niii) binarization objectives for generating hash codes.

Intuitively, feeding multiple modalities of data to vision\ntransformers could improve the performance, yet the inner-modal attentive\nweights may also be diluted, which could thus undermine the final performance.\nIn this paper, we propose a multimodal token fusion method (TokenFusion),\ntailored for transformer-based vision tasks. To effectively fuse multiple\nmodalities, TokenFusion dynamically detects uninformative tokens and\nsubstitutes these tokens with projected and aggregated inter-modal features.\nResidual positional alignment is also adopted to enable explicit utilization of\nthe inter-modal alignments after fusion. The design of TokenFusion allows the\ntransformer to learn correlations among multimodal features, while the\nsingle-modal transformer architecture remains largely intact. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on a variety of homogeneous and heterogeneous\nmodalities and demonstrate that TokenFusion surpasses state-of-the-art methods\nin three typical vision tasks: multimodal image-to-image translation, RGB-depth\nsemantic segmentation, and 3D object detection with point cloud and images.",

However, their integration into many systems also brings with it\nthe vulnerability to test time attacks in the form of Universal Adversarial\nPerturbations (UAPs). UAPs are a class of perturbations that when applied to\nany input causes model misclassification. Although there is an ongoing effort\nto defend models against these adversarial attacks, it is often difficult to\nreconcile the trade-offs in model accuracy and robustness to adversarial\nattacks. Jacobian regularization has been shown to improve the robustness of\nmodels against UAPs, whilst model ensembles have been widely adopted to improve\nboth predictive performance and model robustness. In this work, we propose a\nnovel approach, Jacobian Ensembles-a combination of Jacobian regularization and\nmodel ensembles to significantly increase the robustness against UAPs whilst\nmaintaining or improving model accuracy. Our results show that Jacobian\nEnsembles achieves previously unseen levels of accuracy and robustness, greatly\nimproving over previous methods that tend to skew towards only either accuracy\nor robustness.",

    "abstract": "Atmospheric turbulence has a degrading effect on the image quality of\nlong-range observation systems. As a result of various elements such as\ntemperature, wind velocity, humidity, etc., turbulence is characterized by\nrandom fluctuations in the refractive index of the atmosphere. It is a\nphenomenon that may occur in various imaging spectra such as the visible or the\ninfrared bands. In this paper, we analyze the effects of atmospheric turbulence\non object detection performance in thermal imagery. We use a geometric\nturbulence model to simulate turbulence effects on a medium-scale thermal image\nset, namely \"FLIR ADAS v2\". We apply thermal domain adaptation to\nstate-of-the-art object detectors and propose a data augmentation strategy to\nincrease the performance of object detectors which utilizes turbulent images in\ndifferent severity levels as training data. Our results show that the proposed\ndata augmentation strategy yields an increase in performance for both turbulent\nand non-turbulent thermal test images.",

The emergence of social networking sites\nhas provided a platform for political parties and their candidates to connect\nwith voters in order to spread their political ideas. Our study aims to use\nTwitter in assessing the outcome of Delhi Assembly elections held in 2020,\nusing a bi-level approach, i.e., concerning political parties and their\ncandidates. We analyze the correlation of election results with the activities\nof different candidates and parties on Twitter, and the response of voters on\nthem, especially the mentions and sentiment of voters towards a party. The\nTwitter profiles of the candidates are compared both at the party level as well\nas the candidate level to evaluate their association with the outcome of the\nelection. We observe that the number of followers and the replies to the tweets\nof candidates are good indicators for predicting actual election outcome.\nHowever, we observe that the number of tweets mentioning a party and the\nsentiment of voters towards the party shown in tweets are not aligned with the\nelection result. We also use machine learning models on various features such\nas linguistic, word embeddings and moral dimensions for predicting the election\nresult (win or lose).

    "abstract": "Sign language is a beautiful visual language and is also the primary language\nused by speaking and hearing-impaired people. However, sign language has many\ncomplex expressions, which are difficult for the public to understand and\nmaster. Sign language recognition algorithms will significantly facilitate\ncommunication between hearing-impaired people and normal people. Traditional\ncontinuous sign language recognition often uses a sequence learning method\nbased on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Network\n(LSTM). These methods can only learn spatial and temporal features separately,\nwhich cannot learn the complex spatial-temporal features of sign language. LSTM\nis also difficult to learn long-term dependencies. To alleviate these problems,\nthis paper proposes a multi-view spatial-temporal continuous sign language\nrecognition network. The network consists of three parts. The first part is a\nMulti-View Spatial-Temporal Feature Extractor Network (MSTN), which can\ndirectly extract the spatial-temporal features of RGB and skeleton data; the\nsecond is a sign language encoder network based on Transformer, which can learn\nlong-term dependencies; the third is a Connectionist Temporal Classification\n(CTC) decoder network, which is used to predict the whole meaning of the\ncontinuous sign language. Our algorithm is tested on two public sign language\ndatasets SLR-100 and PHOENIX-Weather 2014T (RWTH). As a result, our method\nachieves excellent performance on both datasets. The word error rate on the\nSLR-100 dataset is 1.9%, and the word error rate on the RWTHPHOENIX-Weather\ndataset is 22.8%.",

A self-adaptive method is\ndeveloped to teach the management module combining results of different experts\nmore efficiently without external knowledge.

    "abstract": "3D dynamic point clouds provide a discrete representation of real-world\nobjects or scenes in motion, which have been widely applied in immersive\ntelepresence, autonomous driving, surveillance, etc. However, point clouds\nacquired from sensors are usually perturbed by noise, which affects downstream\ntasks such as surface reconstruction and analysis. Although many efforts have\nbeen made for static point cloud denoising, dynamic point cloud denoising\nremains under-explored. In this paper, we propose a novel gradient-field-based\ndynamic point cloud denoising method, exploiting the temporal correspondence\nvia the estimation of gradient fields -- a fundamental problem in dynamic point\ncloud processing and analysis. The gradient field is the gradient of the\nlog-probability function of the noisy point cloud, based on which we perform\ngradient ascent so as to converge each point to the underlying clean surface.\nWe estimate the gradient of each surface patch and exploit the temporal\ncorrespondence, where the temporally corresponding patches are searched\nleveraging on rigid motion in classical mechanics. In particular, we treat each\npatch as a rigid object, which moves in the gradient field of an adjacent frame\nvia force until reaching a balanced state, i.e., when the sum of gradients over\nthe patch reaches 0. Since the gradient would be smaller when the point is\ncloser to the underlying surface, the balanced patch would fit the underlying\nsurface well, thus leading to the temporal correspondence. Finally, the\nposition of each point in the patch is updated along the direction of the\ngradient averaged from corresponding patches in adjacent frames. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods under both synthetic noise and simulated real-world noise.",

    "abstract": "CTR prediction has been widely used in the real world. Many methods model\nfeature interaction to improve their performance. However, most methods only\nlearn a fixed representation for each feature without considering the varying\nimportance of each feature under different contexts, resulting in inferior\nperformance. Recently, several methods tried to learn vector-level weights for\nfeature representations to address the fixed representation issue. However,\nthey only produce linear transformations to refine the fixed feature\nrepresentations, which are still not flexible enough to capture the varying\nimportance of each feature under different contexts. In this paper, we propose\na novel module named Feature Refinement Network (FRNet), which learns\ncontext-aware feature representations at bit-level for each feature in\ndifferent contexts. FRNet consists of two key components: 1) Information\nExtraction Unit (IEU), which captures contextual information and cross-feature\nrelationships to guide context-aware feature refinement; and 2) Complementary\nSelection Gate (CSGate), which adaptively integrates the original and\ncomplementary feature representations learned in IEU with bit-level weights.\nNotably, FRNet is orthogonal to existing CTR methods and thus can be applied in\nmany existing methods to boost their performance.

In contrast,\nunlabeled data can be easily collected from an image degradation or restoration\nprocess, making it encouraging to exploit unlabeled training data to boost\nFR-IQA performance. Moreover, due to the distribution inconsistency between\nlabeled and unlabeled data, outliers may occur in unlabeled data, further\nincreasing the training difficulty. In this paper, we suggest to incorporate\nsemi-supervised and positive-unlabeled (PU) learning for exploiting unlabeled\ndata while mitigating the adverse effect of outliers. Particularly, by treating\nall labeled data as positive samples, PU learning is leveraged to identify\nnegative samples (i.e., outliers) from unlabeled data. Semi-supervised learning\n(SSL) is further deployed to exploit positive unlabeled data by dynamically\ngenerating pseudo-MOS. We adopt a dual-branch network including reference and\ndistortion branches. Furthermore, spatial attention is introduced in the\nreference branch to concentrate more on the informative regions, and sliced\nWasserstein distance is used for robust difference map computation to address\nthe misalignment issues caused by images recovered by GAN models.

Previous works extended standard classification methods in the\nobject detection task, mainly adopting the knowledge distillation framework.\nHowever, we argue that object detection introduces an additional problem, which\nhas been overlooked.

To\nincrease TPS without compromising security, we propose a bodyless block\npropagation (BBP) scheme for which the block body is not validated and\ntransmitted during the block propagation process. Rather, the nodes in the\nblockchain network anticipate the transactions and their ordering in the next\nupcoming block so that these transactions can be pre-executed and pre-validated\nbefore the birth of the block. It is critical, however, all nodes have a\nconsensus on the transaction content of the next block.\nThis paper puts forth a transaction selection, ordering, and synchronization\nalgorithm to drive the nodes to reach such a consensus. Yet, the coinbase\naddress of the miner of the next block cannot be anticipated, and therefore\ntransactions that depend on the coinbase address cannot be pre-executed and\npre-validated. This paper further puts forth an algorithm to deal with such\nunresolvable transactions for an overall consistent and TPS-efficient scheme.\nWith our scheme, most transactions do not need to be validated and transmitted\nduring block propagation, ridding the dependence of propagation time on the\nnumber of transactions in the block, and making the system fully TPS scalable.\nExperimental results show that our protocol can reduce propagation time by 4x\nwith respect to the current Ethereum blockchain, and its TPS performance is\nlimited by the node hardware performance rather than block propagation.",

Recently,\none breakthrough, called neural rough differential equations (NRDEs), has been\nproposed and has shown that it is able to process such data.

To\nthis end, we present the method of LOweR-Dimensional embedding of log-signature\n(LORD), where we define an NRDE-based autoencoder to implant the higher-depth\nlog-signature knowledge into the lower-depth log-signature. We show that the\nencoder successfully combines the higher-depth and the lower-depth\nlog-signature knowledge, which greatly stabilizes the training process and\nincreases the model accuracy.

Existing video-based coaching systems often present\nfeedback on the correctness of poses by augmenting videos with visual markers\neither manually by a coach or automatically by computing key parameters from\nposes. However, previewing and augmenting videos limit the analysis and\nvisualization of human poses due to the fixed viewpoints, which confine the\nobservation of captured human movements and cause ambiguity in the augmented\nfeedback. Besides, existing sport-specific systems with embedded bespoke pose\nattributes can hardly generalize to new attributes; directly overlaying two\nposes might not clearly visualize the key differences that viewers would like\nto pursue. To address these issues, we analyze and visualize human pose data\nwith customizable viewpoints and attributes in the context of common\nbiomechanics of running poses, such as joint angles and step distances. Based\non existing literature and a formative study, we have designed and implemented\na system, VCoach, to provide feedback on running poses for amateurs. VCoach\nprovides automatic low-level comparisons of the running poses between a novice\nand an expert, and visualizes the pose differences as part-based 3D animations\non a human model. Meanwhile, it retains the users' controllability and\ncustomizability in high-level functionalities, such as navigating the viewpoint\nfor previewing feedback and defining their own pose attributes through our\ninterface.

Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) based model has gradually\nbecome the theme of knowledge-aware recommendation (KGR). However, there is a\nnatural deficiency for GNN-based KGR models, that is, the sparse supervised\nsignal problem, which may make their actual performance drop to some extent.\nInspired by the recent success of contrastive learning in mining supervised\nsignals from data itself, in this paper, we focus on exploring the contrastive\nlearning in KG-aware recommendation and propose a novel multi-level cross-view\ncontrastive learning mechanism, named MCCLK. Different from traditional\ncontrastive learning methods which generate two graph views by uniform data\naugmentation schemes such as corruption or dropping, we comprehensively\nconsider three different graph views for KG-aware recommendation, including\nglobal-level structural view, local-level collaborative and semantic views.\nSpecifically, we consider the user-item graph as a collaborative view, the\nitem-entity graph as a semantic view, and the user-item-entity graph as a\nstructural view. MCCLK hence performs contrastive learning across three views\non both local and global levels, mining comprehensive graph feature and\nstructure information in a self-supervised manner. Besides, in semantic view, a\nk-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) item-item semantic graph construction module is\nproposed, to capture the important item-item semantic relation which is usually\nignored by previous work. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark\ndatasets show the superior performance of our proposed method over the\nstate-of-the-arts.

    "abstract": "Domain adaptive semantic segmentation attempts to make satisfactory dense\npredictions on an unlabeled target domain by utilizing the model trained on a\nlabeled source domain. One solution is self-training, which retrains models\nwith target pseudo labels. Many methods tend to alleviate noisy pseudo labels,\nhowever, they ignore intrinsic connections among cross-domain pixels with\nsimilar semantic concepts. Thus, they would struggle to deal with the semantic\nvariations across domains, leading to less discrimination and poor\ngeneralization. In this work, we propose Semantic-Guided Pixel Contrast\n(SePiCo), a novel one-stage adaptation framework that highlights the semantic\nconcepts of individual pixel to promote learning of class-discriminative and\nclass-balanced pixel embedding space across domains. Specifically, to explore\nproper semantic concepts, we first investigate a centroid-aware pixel contrast\nthat employs the category centroids of the entire source domain or a single\nsource image to guide the learning of discriminative features. Considering the\npossible lack of category diversity in semantic concepts, we then blaze a trail\nof distributional perspective to involve a sufficient quantity of instances,\nnamely distribution-aware pixel contrast, in which we approximate the true\ndistribution of each semantic category from the statistics of labeled source\ndata. Moreover, such an optimization objective can derive a closed-form upper\nbound by implicitly involving an infinite number of (dis)similar pairs.\nExtensive experiments show that SePiCo not only helps stabilize training but\nalso yields discriminative features, making significant progress in both\ndaytime and nighttime scenarios. Most notably, SePiCo establishes excellent\nresults on tasks of GTAV/SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes and Cityscapes-to-Dark Zurich,\nimproving by 12.8, 8.8, and 9.2 mIoUs compared to the previous best method,\nrespectively.",

Our construction builds upon a new lower bound (that may\nbe of interest of its own right) for an analyst that may ask several non\nadaptive questions in a batch of fixed and known $T$ rounds of adaptivity and\nrequires a fraction of true discoveries. We show that for such an analyst\n$\\Omega (\\sqrt{T}/\\epsilon^2)$ samples are necessary.\nSecond, we show that, under certain assumptions on the oracle, in an\ninteraction with gradient descent $\\tilde \\Omega(1/\\epsilon^{2.5})$ samples are\nnecessary. Our assumptions are that the oracle has only \\emph{first order\naccess} and is \\emph{post-hoc generalizing}. First order access means that it\ncan only compute the gradients of the sampled function at points queried by the\nalgorithm. Our assumption of \\emph{post-hoc generalization} follows from\nexisting lower bounds for statistical queries.

    "abstract": "Achieving subjective and objective quality assessment of underwater images is\nof high significance in underwater visual perception and image/video\nprocessing. However, the development of underwater image quality assessment\n(UIQA) is limited for the lack of comprehensive human subjective user study\nwith publicly available dataset and reliable objective UIQA metric. To address\nthis issue, we establish a large-scale underwater image dataset, dubbed\nUID2021, for evaluating no-reference UIQA metrics. The constructed dataset\ncontains 60 multiply degraded underwater images collected from various sources,\ncovering six common underwater scenes (i.e. bluish scene, bluish-green scene,\ngreenish scene, hazy scene, low-light scene, and turbid scene), and their\ncorresponding 900 quality improved versions generated by employing fifteen\nstate-of-the-art underwater image enhancement and restoration algorithms. Mean\nopinion scores (MOS) for UID2021 are also obtained by using the pair comparison\nsorting method with 52 observers. Both in-air NR-IQA and underwater-specific\nalgorithms are tested on our constructed dataset to fairly compare the\nperformance and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. Our proposed UID2021\ndataset enables ones to evaluate NR UIQA algorithms comprehensively and paves\nthe way for further research on UIQA. Our UID2021 will be a free download and\nutilized for research purposes at: https://github.com/Hou-Guojia/UID2021.",

    "title": "An Efficient Domain-Incremental Learning Approach to Drive in All  Weather Conditions",
    "abstract": "Although deep neural networks enable impressive visual perception performance\nfor autonomous driving, their robustness to varying weather conditions still\nrequires attention. When adapting these models for changed environments, such\nas different weather conditions, they are prone to forgetting previously\nlearned information. This catastrophic forgetting is typically addressed via\nincremental learning approaches which usually re-train the model by either\nkeeping a memory bank of training samples or keeping a copy of the entire model\nor model parameters for each scenario. While these approaches show impressive\nresults, they can be prone to scalability issues and their applicability for\nautonomous driving in all weather conditions has not been shown. In this paper\nwe propose DISC -- Domain Incremental through Statistical Correction -- a\nsimple online zero-forgetting approach which can incrementally learn new tasks\n(i.e weather conditions) without requiring re-training or expensive memory\nbanks. The only information we store for each task are the statistical\nparameters as we categorize each domain by the change in first and second order\nstatistics. Thus, as each task arrives, we simply 'plug and play' the\nstatistical vectors for the corresponding task into the model and it\nimmediately starts to perform well on that task. We show the efficacy of our\napproach by testing it for object detection in a challenging domain-incremental\nautonomous driving scenario where we encounter different adverse weather\nconditions, such as heavy rain, fog, and snow.",

As a case study, we focus on how BERT encodes\ngrammatical number, and on how it uses this encoding to solve the number\nagreement task. Experimentally, we find that BERT relies on a linear encoding\nof grammatical number to produce the correct behavioral output.

WordPiece and BPE are de facto methods employed by\nimportant models, such as BERT and GPT. However, the impact of tokenization can\nbe different for morphologically rich languages, such as Turkic languages,\nwhere many words can be generated by adding prefixes and suffixes. We compare\nfive tokenizers at different granularity levels, i.e. their outputs vary from\nsmallest pieces of characters to the surface form of words, including a\nMorphological-level tokenizer. We train these tokenizers and pretrain\nmedium-sized language models using RoBERTa pretraining procedure on the Turkish\nsplit of the OSCAR corpus. We then fine-tune our models on six downstream\ntasks. Our experiments, supported by statistical tests, reveal that\nMorphological-level tokenizer has challenging performance with de facto\ntokenizers. Furthermore, we find that increasing the vocabulary size improves\nthe performance of Morphological and Word-level tokenizers more than that of de\nfacto tokenizers. The ratio of the number of vocabulary parameters to the total\nnumber of model parameters can be empirically chosen as 20% for de facto\ntokenizers and 40% for other tokenizers to obtain a reasonable trade-off\nbetween model size and performance.",

At the core is to model the rumor characteristics inherent in rich\ninformation, such as propagation patterns in social network and semantic\npatterns in post content, and differentiate them from the truth. However,\nexisting works on rumor detection fall short in modeling heterogeneous\ninformation, either using one single information source only (e.g. social\nnetwork, or post content) or ignoring the relations among multiple sources\n(e.g. fusing social and content features via simple concatenation). Therefore,\nthey possibly have drawbacks in comprehensively understanding the rumors, and\ndetecting them accurately. In this work, we explore contrastive self-supervised\nlearning on heterogeneous information sources, so as to reveal their relations\nand characterize rumors better. Technically, we supplement the main supervised\ntask of detection with an auxiliary self-supervised task, which enriches post\nrepresentations via post self-discrimination. Specifically, given two\nheterogeneous views of a post (i.e. representations encoding social patterns\nand semantic patterns), the discrimination is done by maximizing the mutual\ninformation between different views of the same post compared to that of other\nposts. We devise cluster-wise and instance-wise approaches to generate the\nviews and conduct the discrimination, considering different relations of\ninformation sources. We term this framework as Self-supervised Rumor Detection\n(SRD).

    "abstract": "As Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) implicitly involves compound\nsemantic annotations, we hypothesize auxiliary tasks which are semantically or\nformally related can better enhance AMR parsing. We find that 1) Semantic role\nlabeling (SRL) and dependency parsing (DP), would bring more performance gain\nthan other tasks e.g. MT and summarization in the text-to-AMR transition even\nwith much less data. 2) To make a better fit for AMR, data from auxiliary tasks\nshould be properly \"AMRized\" to PseudoAMR before training. Knowledge from\nshallow level parsing tasks can be better transferred to AMR Parsing with\nstructure transform. 3) Intermediate-task learning is a better paradigm to\nintroduce auxiliary tasks to AMR parsing, compared to multitask learning. From\nan empirical perspective, we propose a principled method to involve auxiliary\ntasks to boost AMR parsing. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves\nnew state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks especially in\ntopology-related scores.",

We study uncertainty propagation\nin warm cloud dynamics of weakly compressible fluids. The mathematical model is\ngoverned by a multiscale system of PDEs in which the macroscopic fluid dynamics\nis described by a weakly compressible Navier-Stokes system and the microscopic\ncloud dynamics is modeled by a convection-diffusion-reaction system. In order\nto quantify uncertainties present in the system, we derive and implement a\ngeneralized polynomial chaos stochastic Galerkin method. Unlike the first part\nof this work, where we restricted our consideration to the partially stochastic\ncase in which the uncertainties were only present in the cloud physics\nequations, we now study a fully random Navier-Stokes-cloud model in which we\ninclude randomness in the macroscopic fluid dynamics as well.

This is a known issue, and requires the\nestablishment of a classification of software types.\nThis paper makes two contributions: the first is to evaluate the quality of\nthe current software classifications landscape. The second is to perform a case\nstudy showing how to create a classification of software types using a curated\nset of software systems.\nOur contributions show that existing, and very likely even new,\nclassification attempts are deemed to fail for one or more issues, that we\nnamed as the `antipatterns' of software classification tasks. We collected 7 of\nthese antipatterns that emerge from both our case study, and the existing\nclassifications.\nThese antipatterns represent recurring issues in a classification, so we\ndiscuss practical ways to help researchers avoid these pitfalls. It becomes\nclear that classification attempts must also face the daunting task of\nformulating a taxonomy of software types, with the objective of establishing a\nhierarchy of categories in a classification.",

In this paper, we contribute\na visual analytic approach that assists professional public speaking coaches in\nimproving their practice of gesture training through analyzing presentation\nvideos. Manually checking and exploring gesture usage in the presentation\nvideos is often tedious and time-consuming. There lacks an efficient method to\nhelp users conduct gesture exploration, which is challenging due to the\nintrinsically temporal evolution of gestures and their complex correlation to\nspeech content. In this paper, we propose GestureLens, a visual analytics\nsystem to facilitate gesture-based and content-based exploration of gesture\nusage in presentation videos. Specifically, the exploration view enables users\nto obtain a quick overview of the spatial and temporal distributions of\ngestures. The dynamic hand movements are firstly aggregated through a heatmap\nin the gesture space for uncovering spatial patterns, and then decomposed into\ntwo mutually perpendicular timelines for revealing temporal patterns. The\nrelation view allows users to explicitly explore the correlation between speech\ncontent and gestures by enabling linked analysis and intuitive glyph designs.\nThe video view and dynamic view show the context and overall dynamic movement\nof the selected gestures, respectively.

A single expert network efficiently addresses\nspecific degradation in nasty winter scenes relying on the compact architecture\nand three novel components.

Such novel image restoration pipeline handles different\ntypes of severe weather scenes effectively and efficiently.

    "abstract": "The goal of co-salient object detection (CoSOD) is to discover salient\nobjects that commonly appear in a query group containing two or more relevant\nimages. Therefore, how to effectively extract inter-image correspondence is\ncrucial for the CoSOD task. In this paper, we propose a global-and-local\ncollaborative learning architecture, which includes a global correspondence\nmodeling (GCM) and a local correspondence modeling (LCM) to capture\ncomprehensive inter-image corresponding relationship among different images\nfrom the global and local perspectives. Firstly, we treat different images as\ndifferent time slices and use 3D convolution to integrate all intra features\nintuitively, which can more fully extract the global group semantics. Secondly,\nwe design a pairwise correlation transformation (PCT) to explore similarity\ncorrespondence between pairwise images and combine the multiple local pairwise\ncorrespondences to generate the local inter-image relationship. Thirdly, the\ninter-image relationships of the GCM and LCM are integrated through a\nglobal-and-local correspondence aggregation (GLA) module to explore more\ncomprehensive inter-image collaboration cues. Finally, the intra- and\ninter-features are adaptively integrated by an intra-and-inter weighting fusion\n(AEWF) module to learn co-saliency features and predict the co-saliency map.\nThe proposed GLNet is evaluated on three prevailing CoSOD benchmark datasets,\ndemonstrating that our model trained on a small dataset (about 3k images) still\noutperforms eleven state-of-the-art competitors trained on some large datasets\n(about 8k-200k images).",

    "abstract": "Although Transformers have gained success in several speech processing tasks\nlike spoken language understanding (SLU) and speech translation (ST), achieving\nonline processing while keeping competitive performance is still essential for\nreal-world interaction. In this paper, we take the first step on streaming SLU\nand simultaneous ST using a blockwise streaming Transformer, which is based on\ncontextual block processing and blockwise synchronous beam search. Furthermore,\nwe design an automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based intermediate loss\nregularization for the streaming SLU task to improve the classification\nperformance further. As for the simultaneous ST task, we propose a\ncross-lingual encoding method, which employs a CTC branch optimized with target\nlanguage translations. In addition, the CTC translation output is also used to\nrefine the search space with CTC prefix score, achieving joint CTC/attention\nsimultaneous translation for the first time. Experiments for SLU are conducted\non FSC and SLURP corpora, while the ST task is evaluated on Fisher-CallHome\nSpanish and MuST-C En-De corpora. Experimental results show that the blockwise\nstreaming Transformer achieves competitive results compared to offline models,\nespecially with our proposed methods that further yield a 2.4% accuracy gain on\nthe SLU task and a 4.3 BLEU gain on the ST task over streaming baselines.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is an approach to transfer information on\nrepresentations from a teacher to a student by reducing their difference. A\nchallenge of this approach is to reduce the flexibility of the student's\nrepresentations inducing inaccurate learning of the teacher's knowledge. To\nresolve it in BERT transferring, we investigate distillation of structures of\nrepresentations specified to three types: intra-feature, local inter-feature,\nglobal inter-feature structures. To transfer them, we introduce \\textit{feature\nstructure distillation} methods based on the Centered Kernel Alignment, which\nassigns a consistent value to similar features structures and reveals more\ninformative relations. In particular, a memory-augmented transfer method with\nclustering is implemented for the global structures. In the experiments on the\nnine tasks for language understanding of the GLUE dataset, the proposed methods\neffectively transfer the three types of structures and improve performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art distillation methods. Indeed, the code for the\nmethods is available in https://github.com/maroo-sky/FSD",

    "abstract": "Deep neural network (DNN) suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning\nincrementally, which greatly limits its applications. Although maintaining a\nhandful of samples (called `exemplars`) of each task could alleviate forgetting\nto some extent, existing methods are still limited by the small number of\nexemplars since these exemplars are too few to carry enough task-specific\nknowledge, and therefore the forgetting remains. To overcome this problem, we\npropose to `imagine` diverse counterparts of given exemplars referring to the\nabundant semantic-irrelevant information from unlabeled data. Specifically, we\ndevelop a learnable feature generator to diversify exemplars by adaptively\ngenerating diverse counterparts of exemplars based on semantic information from\nexemplars and semantically-irrelevant information from unlabeled data. We\nintroduce semantic contrastive learning to enforce the generated samples to be\nsemantic consistent with exemplars and perform semanticdecoupling contrastive\nlearning to encourage diversity of generated samples. The diverse generated\nsamples could effectively prevent DNN from forgetting when learning new tasks.\nOur method does not bring any extra inference cost and outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on two benchmarks CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-Subset by a\nclear margin.",

In this paper, we conduct a large-scale\nlongitudinal measurement of Sinophobia, between 2016 and 2021, on two\nmainstream and fringe Web communities. By analyzing 8B posts from Reddit and\n206M posts from 4chan's /pol/, we investigate the origins, evolution, and\ncontent of Sinophobia. We find that, anti-Chinese content may be evoked by\npolitical events not directly related to China, e.g., the U.S. withdrawal from\nthe Paris Agreement. And during the COVID-19 pandemic, daily usage of\nSinophobic slurs has significantly increased even with the hate-speech ban\npolicy. We also show that the semantic meaning of the words \"China\" and\n\"Chinese\" are shifting towards Sinophobic slurs with the rise of COVID-19 and\nremain the same in the pandemic period. We further use topic modeling to show\nthe topics of Sinophobic discussion are pretty diverse and broad. We find that\nboth Web communities share some common Sinophobic topics like ethnics,\neconomics and commerce, weapons and military, foreign relations, etc. However,\ncompared to 4chan's /pol/, more daily life-related topics including food, game,\nand stock are found in Reddit.

Sadly, attacks to extract model parameters\nare on the rise, and thus designers are being forced to create architectures\nfor securing such models. State-of-the-art proposals in this field take the\ndeterministic memory access patterns of such networks into cognizance (albeit\npartially), group a set of memory blocks into a tile, and maintain state at the\nlevel of tiles (to reduce storage space). For providing integrity guarantees\n(tamper avoidance), they don't propose any significant optimizations, and still\nmaintain block-level state.\nWe observe that it is possible to exploit the deterministic memory access\npatterns of DNNs even further, and maintain state information for only the\ncurrent tile and current layer, which may comprise a large number of tiles.\nThis reduces the storage space, reduces the number of memory accesses,\nincreases performance, and simplifies the design without sacrificing any\nsecurity guarantees. The key techniques in our proposed accelerator\narchitecture, Seculator, are to encode memory access patterns to create a small\nHW-based tile version number generator for a given layer, and to store\nlayer-level MACs. We completely eliminate the need for having a MAC cache and a\ntile version number store (as used in related work).

This paper offers an\nempirical understanding of an under-explored problem, namely partially\nsupervised multi-label classification (PSMLC), where a multi-label classifier\nis trained with only partially labeled medical images. In contrast to the fully\nsupervised counterpart, the partial supervision caused by medical data scarcity\nhas non-trivial negative impacts on the model performance.

    "abstract": "Applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL), in which agents learn to make a\nsequence of decisions despite lacking complete information about the latent\nstates of the controlled system, that is, they act under partial observability\nof the states, are ubiquitous. Partially observable RL can be notoriously\ndifficult -- well-known information-theoretic results show that learning\npartially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) requires an exponential\nnumber of samples in the worst case. Yet, this does not rule out the existence\nof large subclasses of POMDPs over which learning is tractable.\nIn this paper we identify such a subclass, which we call weakly revealing\nPOMDPs. This family rules out the pathological instances of POMDPs where\nobservations are uninformative to a degree that makes learning hard. We prove\nthat for weakly revealing POMDPs, a simple algorithm combining optimism and\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is sufficient to guarantee polynomial\nsample complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first provably\nsample-efficient result for learning from interactions in overcomplete POMDPs,\nwhere the number of latent states can be larger than the number of\nobservations.",

    "abstract": "To maximize the economic benefits of geothermal energy production, it is\nessential to optimize geothermal reservoir management strategies, in which\ngeologic uncertainty should be considered. In this work, we propose a\nclosed-loop optimization framework, based on deep learning surrogates, for the\nwell control optimization of geothermal reservoirs. In this framework, we\nconstruct a hybrid convolution-recurrent neural network surrogate, which\ncombines the convolution neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)\nrecurrent network. The convolution structure can extract spatial information of\ngeologic parameter fields and the recurrent structure can approximate\nsequence-to-sequence mapping. The trained model can predict time-varying\nproduction responses (rate, temperature, etc.) for cases with different\npermeability fields and well control sequences. In the closed-loop optimization\nframework, production optimization based on the differential evolution (DE)\nalgorithm, and data assimilation based on the iterative ensemble smoother\n(IES), are performed alternately to achieve real-time well control optimization\nand geologic parameter estimation as the production proceeds. In addition, the\naveraged objective function over the ensemble of geologic parameter estimations\nis adopted to consider geologic uncertainty in the optimization process.\nSeveral geothermal reservoir development cases are designed to test the\nperformance of the proposed production optimization framework. The results show\nthat the proposed framework can achieve efficient and effective real-time\noptimization and data assimilation in the geothermal reservoir production\nprocess.",

    "abstract": "In the realm of unsupervised learning, Bayesian nonparametric mixture models,\nexemplified by the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM), provide a principled\napproach for adapting the complexity of the model to the data. Such models are\nparticularly useful in clustering tasks where the number of clusters is\nunknown. Despite their potential and mathematical elegance, however, DPMMs have\nyet to become a mainstream tool widely adopted by practitioners. This is\narguably due to a misconception that these models scale poorly as well as the\nlack of high-performance (and user-friendly) software tools that can handle\nlarge datasets efficiently. In this paper we bridge this practical gap by\nproposing a new, easy-to-use, statistical software package for scalable DPMM\ninference. More concretely, we provide efficient and easily-modifiable\nimplementations for high-performance distributed sampling-based inference in\nDPMMs where the user is free to choose between either a multiple-machine,\nmultiple-core, CPU implementation (written in Julia) and a multiple-stream GPU\nimplementation (written in CUDA/C++). Both the CPU and GPU implementations come\nwith a common (and optional) python wrapper, providing the user with a single\npoint of entry with the same interface. On the algorithmic side, our\nimplementations leverage a leading DPMM sampler from (Chang and Fisher III,\n2013). While Chang and Fisher III's implementation (written in MATLAB/C++) used\nonly CPU and was designed for a single multi-core machine, the packages we\nproposed here distribute the computations efficiently across either multiple\nmulti-core machines or across mutiple GPU streams. This leads to speedups,\nalleviates memory and storage limitations, and lets us fit DPMMs to\nsignificantly larger datasets and of higher dimensionality than was possible\npreviously by either (Chang and Fisher III, 2013) or other DPMM methods.",

    "abstract": "There currently are two main approaches to reproducing visual appearance\nusing Machine Learning (ML): The first is training models that generalize over\ndifferent instances of a problem, e.g., different images from a dataset. Such\nmodels learn priors over the data corpus and use this knowledge to provide fast\ninference with little input, often as a one-shot operation. However, this\ngenerality comes at the cost of fidelity, as such methods often struggle to\nachieve the final quality required. The second approach does not train a model\nthat generalizes across the data, but overfits to a single instance of a\nproblem, e.g., a flash image of a material. This produces detailed and\nhigh-quality results, but requires time-consuming training and is, as mere\nnon-linear function fitting, unable to exploit previous experience. Techniques\nsuch as fine-tuning or auto-decoders combine both approaches but are sequential\nand rely on per-exemplar optimization. We suggest to combine both techniques\nend-to-end using meta-learning: We over-fit onto a single problem instance in\nan inner loop, while also learning how to do so efficiently in an outer-loop\nthat builds intuition over many optimization runs. We demonstrate this concept\nto be versatile and efficient, applying it to RGB textures, Bi-directional\nReflectance Distribution Functions (BRDFs), or Spatially-varying BRDFs\n(svBRDFs).",

    "abstract": "We introduce a segmentation-guided approach to synthesise images that\nintegrate features from two distinct domains. Images synthesised by our\ndual-domain model belong to one domain within the semantic mask, and to another\nin the rest of the image - smoothly integrated. We build on the successes of\nfew-shot StyleGAN and single-shot semantic segmentation to minimise the amount\nof training required in utilising two domains. The method combines a few-shot\ncross-domain StyleGAN with a latent optimiser to achieve images containing\nfeatures of two distinct domains. We use a segmentation-guided perceptual loss,\nwhich compares both pixel-level and activations between domain-specific and\ndual-domain synthetic images. Results demonstrate qualitatively and\nquantitatively that our model is capable of synthesising dual-domain images on\na variety of objects (faces, horses, cats, cars), domains (natural, caricature,\nsketches) and part-based masks (eyes, nose, mouth, hair, car bonnet).

    "abstract": "Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art results across multiple NLP\ntasks. However, the self-attention mechanism complexity scales quadratically\nwith the sequence length, creating an obstacle for tasks involving long\nsequences, like in the speech domain. In this paper, we discuss the usefulness\nof self-attention for Direct Speech Translation. First, we analyze the\nlayer-wise token contributions in the self-attention of the encoder, unveiling\nlocal diagonal patterns. To prove that some attention weights are avoidable, we\npropose to substitute the standard self-attention with a local efficient one,\nsetting the amount of context used based on the results of the analysis. With\nthis approach, our model matches the baseline performance, and improves the\nefficiency by skipping the computation of those weights that standard attention\ndiscards.",

    "abstract": "Emerging distributed cloud architectures, e.g., fog and mobile edge\ncomputing, are playing an increasingly important role in the efficient delivery\nof real-time stream-processing applications such as augmented reality,\nmultiplayer gaming, and industrial automation. While such applications require\nprocessed streams to be shared and simultaneously consumed by multiple\nusers/devices, existing technologies lack efficient mechanisms to deal with\ntheir inherent multicast nature, leading to unnecessary traffic redundancy and\nnetwork congestion. In this paper, we establish a unified framework for\ndistributed cloud network control with generalized (mixed-cast) traffic flows\nthat allows optimizing the distributed execution of the required packet\nprocessing, forwarding, and replication operations. We first characterize the\nenlarged multicast network stability region under the new control framework\n(with respect to its unicast counterpart). We then design a novel queuing\nsystem that allows scheduling data packets according to their current\ndestination sets, and leverage Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty theory to develop\nthe first fully decentralized, throughput- and cost-optimal algorithm for\nmulticast cloud network flow control. Numerical experiments validate analytical\nresults and demonstrate the performance gain of the proposed design over\nexisting cloud network control techniques.",

    "abstract": "Existing quantum compilers optimize quantum circuits by applying circuit\ntransformations designed by experts. This approach requires significant manual\neffort to design and implement circuit transformations for different quantum\ndevices, which use different gate sets, and can miss optimizations that are\nhard to find manually. We propose Quartz, a quantum circuit superoptimizer that\nautomatically generates and verifies circuit transformations for arbitrary\nquantum gate sets. For a given gate set, Quartz generates candidate circuit\ntransformations by systematically exploring small circuits and verifies the\ndiscovered transformations using an automated theorem prover. To optimize a\nquantum circuit, Quartz uses a cost-based backtracking search that applies the\nverified transformations to the circuit. Our evaluation on three popular gate\nsets shows that Quartz can effectively generate and verify transformations for\ndifferent gate sets. The generated transformations cover manually designed\ntransformations used by existing optimizers and also include new\ntransformations. Quartz is therefore able to optimize a broad range of circuits\nfor diverse gate sets, outperforming or matching the performance of hand-tuned\ncircuit optimizers.",

While in the classic sequential setting,\nthis assumption gives no additional power (as a planar graph can be embedded in\nlinear time), we show that this is far from being the case in other settings.\nWe assume that the embedding is straight-line, but our methods also generalize\nto non-straight-line embeddings. Specifically, we focus on sublinear-time\ncomputation and massively parallel computation (MPC).\nOur main technical contribution is a sublinear-time algorithm for computing a\nrelaxed version of an $r$-division.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in digital imaging, e.g., increased number of pixels\ncaptured, have meant that the volume of data to be processed and analyzed from\nthese images has also increased. Deep learning algorithms are state-of-the-art\nfor analyzing such images, given their high accuracy when trained with a large\ndata volume of data. Nevertheless, such analysis requires considerable\ncomputational power, making such algorithms time- and resource-demanding. Such\nhigh demands can be met by using third-party cloud service providers. However,\nanalyzing medical images using such services raises several legal and privacy\nchallenges and does not necessarily provide real-time results. This paper\nprovides a computing architecture that locally and in parallel can analyze\nmedical images in real-time using deep learning thus avoiding the legal and\nprivacy challenges stemming from uploading data to a third-party cloud\nprovider. To make local image processing efficient on modern multi-core\nprocessors, we utilize parallel execution to offset the resource-intensive\ndemands of deep neural networks. We focus on a specific medical-industrial case\nstudy, namely the quantifying of blood vessels in microcirculation images for\nwhich we have developed a working system.

It\nis difficult, if possible at all, for such a global model to commonly achieve\noptimal performance for each individual client, due to the heterogeneity of\nmedical data from various scanners and patient demographics. This problem\nbecomes even more significant when deploying the global model to unseen clients\noutside the FL with new distributions not presented during federated training.\nTo optimize the prediction accuracy of each individual client for critical\nmedical tasks, we propose a novel unified framework for both Inside and Outside\nmodel Personalization in FL (IOP-FL). Our inside personalization is achieved by\na lightweight gradient-based approach that exploits the local adapted model for\neach client, by accumulating both the global gradients for common knowledge and\nlocal gradients for client-specific optimization. Moreover, and importantly,\nthe obtained local personalized models and the global model can form a diverse\nand informative routing space to personalize a new model for outside FL\nclients. Hence, we design a new test-time routing scheme inspired by the\nconsistency loss with a shape constraint to dynamically incorporate the models,\ngiven the distribution information conveyed by the test data.

    "title": "State-Output Risk-Constrained Quadratic Control of Partially Observed  Linear Systems",
    "abstract": "We propose a methodology for performing risk-averse quadratic regulation of\npartially observed Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems disturbed by process and\noutput noise. To compensate against the induced variability due to both types\nof noises, state regulation is subject to two risk constraints. The latter\nrenders the resulting controller cautious of stochastic disturbances, by\nrestricting the statistical variability, namely, a simplified version of the\ncumulative expected predictive variance of both the state and the output. Our\nproposed formulation results in an optimal risk-averse policy that preserves\nfavorable characteristics of the classical Linear Quadratic (LQ) control. In\nparticular, the optimal policy has an affine structure with respect to the\nminimum mean square error (mmse) estimates. The linear component of the policy\nregulates the state more strictly in riskier directions, where the process and\noutput noise covariance, cross-covariance, and the corresponding penalties are\nsimultaneously large. This is achieved by \"inflating\" the state penalty in a\nsystematic way. The additional affine terms force the state against pure and\ncross third-order statistics of the process and output disturbances. Another\nfavorable characteristic of our optimal policy is that it can be pre-computed\noff-line, thus, avoiding limitations of prior work. Stability analysis shows\nthat the derived controller is always internally stable regardless of parameter\ntuning. The functionality of the proposed risk-averse policy is illustrated\nthrough a working example via extensive numerical simulations.",

PANDA\niteratively optimizes the objective function given noise augmented data until\nconvergence to obtain the regularized model estimates. The augmented noises are\ndesigned to achieve various regularization effects, including $l_0$, bridge\n(lasso and ridge included), elastic net, adaptive lasso, and SCAD, as well as\ngroup lasso and fused ridge. We examine the tail bound of the noise-augmented\nloss function and establish the almost sure convergence of the noise-augmented\nloss function and its minimizer to the expected penalized loss function and its\nminimizer, respectively. We derive the asymptotic distributions for the\nregularized parameters, based on which, inferences can be obtained\nsimultaneously with variable selection. PANDA exhibits ensemble learning\nbehaviors that help further decrease the generalization error. Computationally,\nPANDA is easy to code, leveraging existing software for implementing GLMs,\nwithout resorting to complicated optimization techniques. We demonstrate the\nsuperior or similar performance of PANDA against the existing approaches of the\nsame type of regularizers in simulated and real-life data.

A major concern in\nthese systems is that residents do not report problems at the same rates,\nleading to an inequitable allocation of government resources. However,\nmeasuring such under-reporting is a difficult statistical task, as, almost by\ndefinition, we do not observe incidents that are not reported. Thus,\ndistinguishing between low reporting rates and low ground-truth incident rates\nis challenging. We develop a method to identify (heterogeneous) reporting\nrates, without using external (proxy) ground truth data. Our insight is that\nrates on $\\textit{duplicate}$ reports about the same incident can be leveraged,\nto turn the question into a standard Poisson rate estimation task -- even\nthough the full incident reporting interval is also unobserved.

    "abstract": "Tracking multiple objects through time is an important part of an intelligent\ntransportation system. Random finite set (RFS)-based filters are one of the\nemerging techniques for tracking multiple objects. In multi-object tracking\n(MOT), a common assumption is that each object is moving independent of its\nsurroundings. But in many real-world applications, target objects interact with\none another and the environment. Such interactions, when considered for\ntracking, are usually modeled by an interactive motion model which is\napplication specific. In this paper, we present a novel approach to incorporate\ntarget interactions within the prediction step of an RFS-based multi-target\nfilter, i.e. labeled multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter. The method has been\ndeveloped for two practical applications of tracking a coordinated swarm and\nvehicles. The method has been tested for a complex vehicle tracking dataset and\ncompared with the LMB filter through the OSPA and OSPA$^{(2)}$ metrics. The\nresults demonstrate that the proposed interaction-aware method depicts\nconsiderable performance enhancement over the LMB filter in terms of the\nselected metrics.",

In the time-frequency domain, we propose to use a subband\nnetwork to perform dereverberation for different frequency bands independently.\nThe time-domain convolution can be well decomposed to subband convolutions,\nthence it is reasonable to train the subband network to perform subband\ndeconvolution. The learning target for dereverberation is usually set as the\ndirect-path speech or optionally with some early reflections. This type of\ntarget suddenly truncates the reverberation, and thus it may not be suitable\nfor network training, and leads to a large prediction error. In this work, we\npropose a RTS learning target to suppress reverberation and meanwhile maintain\nthe exponential decaying property of reverberation, which will ease the network\ntraining, and thus reduce the prediction error and signal distortions.\nExperiments show that the subband network can achieve outstanding\ndereverberation performance, and the proposed target has a smaller prediction\nerror than the target of direct-path speech and early reflections.",

The state-of-the-art deep\nlearning-based methods often simply concatenate the raw geometric attributes\n(i.e., coordinates and normal vectors) of mesh cells to train a single-stream\nnetwork for automatic intra-oral scanner image segmentation. However, since\ndifferent raw attributes reveal completely different geometric information, the\nnaive concatenation of different raw attributes at the (low-level) input stage\nmay bring unnecessary confusion in describing and differentiating between mesh\ncells, thus hampering the learning of high-level geometric representations for\nthe segmentation task. To address this issue, we design a two-stream graph\nconvolutional network (i.e., TSGCN), which can effectively handle inter-view\nconfusion between different raw attributes to more effectively fuse their\ncomplementary information and learn discriminative multi-view geometric\nrepresentations. Specifically, our TSGCN adopts two input-specific\ngraph-learning streams to extract complementary high-level geometric\nrepresentations from coordinates and normal vectors, respectively. Then, these\nsingle-view representations are further fused by a self-attention module to\nadaptively balance the contributions of different views in learning more\ndiscriminative multi-view representations for accurate and fully automatic\ntooth segmentation. We have evaluated our TSGCN on a real-patient dataset of\ndental (mesh) models acquired by 3D intraoral scanners.

Monotonic transducers have a few advantages. First, RNN-T can suffer\nfrom runaway hallucination, where a model keeps emitting non-blank symbols\nwithout advancing in time, often in an infinite loop. Secondly, monotonic\ntransducers consume exactly one model score per time step and are therefore\nmore compatible and unifiable with traditional FST-based hybrid ASR decoders.\nHowever, the MonoRNN-T so far has been found to have worse accuracy than RNN-T.\nIt does not have to be that way, though: By regularizing the training - via\njoint LAS training or parameter initialization from RNN-T - both MonoRNN-T and\nCTC-T perform as well - or better - than RNN-T.

However, existing methods based\non principled modeling and classic numerical techniques have faced significant\nchallenges, particularly when it comes to complex 3D patient-specific shapes in\nthe real world. First, it is notoriously challenging to parameterize the input\nspace of arbitrarily complex 3-D geometries. Second, the process often involves\nmassive forward simulations, which are extremely computationally demanding or\neven infeasible. We propose a novel deep learning surrogate modeling solution\nto address these challenges and enable rapid hemodynamic predictions.\nSpecifically, a statistical generative model for 3-D patient-specific shapes is\ndeveloped based on a small set of baseline patient-specific geometries. An\nunsupervised shape correspondence solution is used to enable geometric morphing\nand scalable shape synthesis statistically. Moreover, a simulation routine is\ndeveloped for automatic data generation by automatic meshing, boundary setting,\nsimulation, and post-processing. An efficient supervised learning solution is\nproposed to map the geometric inputs to the hemodynamics predictions in latent\nspaces. Numerical studies on aortic flows are conducted to demonstrate the\neffectiveness and merit of the proposed techniques.",

    "abstract": "The binary rank of a $0,1$ matrix is the smallest size of a partition of its\nones into monochromatic combinatorial rectangles. A matrix $M$ is called $(k_1,\n\\ldots, k_m ; n_1, \\ldots, n_m)$ circulant block diagonal if it is a block\nmatrix with $m$ diagonal blocks, such that for each $i \\in [m]$, the $i$th\ndiagonal block of $M$ is the circulant matrix whose first row has $k_i$ ones\nfollowed by $n_i-k_i$ zeros, and all of whose other entries are zeros. In this\nwork, we study the binary rank of these matrices and of their complement. In\nparticular, we compare the binary rank of these matrices to their rank over the\nreals, which forms a lower bound on the former.\nWe present a general method for proving upper bounds on the binary rank of\nblock matrices that have diagonal blocks of some specified structure and ones\nelsewhere. Using this method, we prove that the binary rank of the complement\nof a $(k_1, \\ldots, k_m ; n_1, \\ldots, n_m)$ circulant block diagonal matrix\nfor integers satisfying $n_i>k_i>0$ for each $i \\in [m]$ exceeds its real rank\nby no more than the maximum of $\\gcd(n_i,k_i)-1$ over all $i \\in [m]$. We\nfurther present several sufficient conditions for the binary rank of these\nmatrices to strictly exceed their real rank. By combining the upper and lower\nbounds, we determine the exact binary rank of various families of matrices and,\nin addition, significantly generalize a result of Gregory.\nMotivated by a question of Pullman, we study the binary rank of $k$-regular\n$0,1$ matrices and of their complement. As an application of our results on\ncirculant block diagonal matrices, we show that for every $k \\geq 2$, there\nexist $k$-regular $0,1$ matrices whose binary rank is strictly larger than that\nof their complement. Furthermore, we exactly determine for every integer $r$,\nthe smallest possible binary rank of the complement of a $2$-regular $0,1$\nmatrix with binary rank $r$.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, due to the widespread use of smartphones in everyday life and the\nimprovement of computational capabilities of these devices, many complex tasks\ncan now be deployed on them. Concerning the need for continuous monitoring of\nvital signs, especially for the elderly or those with certain types of\ndiseases, the development of algorithms that can estimate vital signs using\nsmartphones has attracted researchers worldwide. Such algorithms estimate vital\nsigns (heart rate and oxygen saturation level) by processing an input PPG\nsignal. These methods often apply multiple pre-processing steps to the input\nsignal before the prediction step. This can increase the computational\ncomplexity of these methods, meaning only a limited number of mobile devices\ncan run them. Furthermore, multiple pre-processing steps also require the\ndesign of a couple of hand-crafted stages to obtain an optimal result. This\nresearch proposes a novel end-to-end solution to mobile-based vital sign\nestimation by deep learning. The proposed method does not require any\npre-processing. Due to the use of fully convolutional architecture, the\nparameter count of our proposed model is, on average, a quarter of the ordinary\narchitectures that use fully-connected layers as the prediction heads. As a\nresult, the proposed model has less over-fitting chance and computational\ncomplexity. A public dataset for vital sign estimation, including 62 videos\ncollected from 35 men and 27 women, is also provided. The experimental results\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art estimation accuracy.",

    "abstract": "One of the most important technical challenges when designing a Cognitive\nRadio Networks (CRNs) is spectrum sensing, which has the responsibility of\nrecognizing the presence or absence of the primary users in the frequency\nbands. A common technique used for spectrum sensing is double energy detection\nsince it can operate without any prior information regarding the\ncharacteristics of the primary user signals. A double threshold energy\ndetection algorithm is based on the use of two thresholds, to check the energy\nof the received signals and decided whether the spectrum is occupied or not.\nFurthermore, thresholds play a key role in the energy detection algorithm, by\nconsidering the stochastic features of noise in this model, as a result\ncalculating the optimal threshold is a crucial task. In this paper, the\nBi-Section algorithm was used to detect the optimum energy level in the fuzzy\nregion which is an area between the low and high energy threshold. For this\npurpose, the decision threshold was determined by the use of the Bisection\nfunction for cognitive users. Numerical simulations show that the proposed\nmethod achieves better detection performance than the conventional\ndouble-threshold energy-sensing schemes.

Specifically, numerous domain\nadaptation (DA) algorithms have been exploited in the past five years to\nenhance the generalization of emotion recognition models across subjects. The\nDA methods assume that calibration data (although unlabeled) exists in the\ntarget domain (new user). However, this assumption conflicts with the\napplication scenario that the model should be deployed without the\ntime-consuming calibration experiments. We argue that domain generalization\n(DG) is more reasonable than DA in these applications. DG learns how to\ngeneralize to unseen target domains by leveraging knowledge from multiple\nsource domains, which provides a new possibility to train general models. In\nthis paper, we for the first time benchmark state-of-the-art DG algorithms on\nEEG-based emotion recognition. Since convolutional neural network (CNN), deep\nbrief network (DBN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) have been proved to be\neffective emotion recognition models, we use these three models as solid\nbaselines.
