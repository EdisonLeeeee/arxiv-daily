    "title": "Causal Discovery and Causal Learning for Fire Resistance Evaluation:  Incorporating Domain Knowledge",
    "abstract": "Experiments remain the gold standard to establish an understanding of\nfire-related phenomena. A primary goal in designing tests is to uncover the\ndata generating process (i.e., the how and why the observations we see come to\nbe); or simply what causes such observations. Uncovering such a process not\nonly advances our knowledge but also provides us with the capability to be able\nto predict phenomena accurately. This paper presents an approach that leverages\ncausal discovery and causal inference to evaluate the fire resistance of\nstructural members. In this approach, causal discovery algorithms are adopted\nto uncover the causal structure between key variables pertaining to the fire\nresistance of reinforced concrete (RC) columns. Then, companion inference\nalgorithms are applied to infer (estimate) the influence of each variable on\nthe fire resistance given a specific intervention. Finally, this study ends by\ncontrasting the algorithmic causal discovery with that obtained from domain\nknowledge and traditional machine learning. Our findings clearly show the\npotential and merit of adopting causality into our domain.",

    "abstract": "Release notes are admitted as an essential document by practitioners. They\ncontain the summary of the source code changes for the software releases, such\nas issue fixes, added new features, and performance improvements. Manually\nproducing release notes is a time-consuming and challenging task. For that\nreason, sometimes developers neglect to write release notes. For example, we\ncollect data from GitHub with over 1,900 releases, among them 37% of the\nrelease notes are empty. We propose an automatic generate release notes\napproach based on the commit messages and merge pull-request (PR) titles to\nmitigate this problem. We implement one of the popular extractive text\nsummarization techniques, i.e., the TextRank algorithm. However, accurate\nkeyword extraction is a vital issue in text processing. The keyword matching\nand topic extraction process of the TextRank algorithm ignores the semantic\nsimilarity among texts. To improve the keyword extraction method, we integrate\nthe GloVe word embedding technique with TextRank. We develop a dataset with\n1,213 release notes (after null filtering) and evaluate the generated release\nnotes through the ROUGE metric and human evaluation. We also compare the\nperformance of our technique with another popular extractive algorithm, latent\nsemantic analysis (LSA).

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully used in many problems\ninvolving graph-structured data, achieving state-of-the-art performance. GNNs\ntypically employ a message-passing scheme, in which every node aggregates\ninformation from its neighbors using a permutation-invariant aggregation\nfunction. Standard well-examined choices such as the mean or sum aggregation\nfunctions have limited capabilities, as they are not able to capture\ninteractions among neighbors. In this work, we formalize these interactions\nusing an information-theoretic framework that notably includes synergistic\ninformation. Driven by this definition, we introduce the Graph Ordering\nAttention (GOAT) layer, a novel GNN component that captures interactions\nbetween nodes in a neighborhood. This is achieved by learning local node\norderings via an attention mechanism and processing the ordered representations\nusing a recurrent neural network aggregator. This design allows us to make use\nof a permutation-sensitive aggregator while maintaining the\npermutation-equivariance of the proposed GOAT layer. The GOAT model\ndemonstrates its increased performance in modeling graph metrics that capture\ncomplex information, such as the betweenness centrality and the effective size\nof a node. In practical use-cases, its superior modeling capability is\nconfirmed through its success in several real-world node classification\nbenchmarks.",

    "abstract": "A software release note is one of the essential documents in the software\ndevelopment life cycle. The software release contains a set of information,\ne.g., bug fixes and security fixes. Release notes are used in different phases,\ne.g., requirement engineering, software testing and release management.\nDifferent types of practitioners (e.g., project managers and clients) get\nbenefited from the release notes to understand the overview of the latest\nrelease. As a result, several studies have been done about release notes\nproduction and usage in practice. However, two significant problems (e.g.,\nduplication and inconsistency in release notes contents) exist in producing\nwell-written & well-structured release notes and organizing appropriate\ninformation regarding different targeted users' needs. For that reason,\npractitioners face difficulties in writing and reading the release notes using\nexisting tools. To mitigate these problems, we execute two different studies in\nour paper. First, we execute an exploratory study by analyzing 3,347 release\nnotes of 21 GitHub repositories to understand the documented contents of the\nrelease notes. As a result, we find relevant key artifacts, e.g., issues (29%),\npull-requests (32%), commits (19%), and common vulnerabilities and exposures\n(CVE) issues (6%) in the release note contents. Second, we conduct a survey\nstudy with 32 professionals to understand the key information that is included\nin release notes regarding users' roles. For example, project managers are more\ninterested in learning about new features than less critical bug fixes. Our\nstudy can guide future research directions to help practitioners produce the\nrelease notes with relevant content and improve the documentation quality.",

    "abstract": "Sentiment analysis is an important task in natural language processing. In\nrecent works, pre-trained language models are often used to achieve\nstate-of-the-art results, especially when training data is scarce. It is common\nto fine-tune on the downstream task, usually by adding task-specific layers on\ntop of the model. In this paper, we focus on aspect-based sentiment analysis,\nwhich involves extracting aspect term, category, and predicting their\ncorresponding polarities. In particular, we are interested in few-shot\nsettings. We propose to reformulate the extraction and prediction tasks into\nthe sequence generation task, using a generative language model with\nunidirectional attention (GPT2 is used unless stated otherwise). This way, the\nmodel learns to accomplish the tasks via language generation without the need\nof training task-specific layers. Our evaluation results on the single-task\npolarity prediction show that our approach outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art (based on BERT) on average performance by a large margins in\nfew-shot and full-shot settings. More importantly, our generative approach\nsignificantly reduces the model variance caused by low-resource data. We\nfurther demonstrate that the proposed generative language model can handle\njoint and multi-task settings, unlike previous work. We observe that the\nproposed sequence generation method achieves further improved performances on\npolarity prediction when the model is trained via joint and multi-task\nsettings. Further evaluation on similar sentiment analysis datasets, SST-2,\nSST- and OOS intent detection validates the superiority and noise robustness of\ngenerative language model in few-shot settings.",

Then, we propose a novel concurrent switching\ndynamics (CSD) with deterministic transitions among a finite number of states,\nrepresenting the NOIR movement phases. We define the CSD control as a cyclic\nreceding horizon optimization problem with periodic quadratic cost and\nconstraints. More specifically, the cost is defined so that the traffic density\nis minimized and the boundary inflow is uniformly distributed over the boundary\ninlet roads, whereas the cost parameters are periodically changed with time.\nThe constraints are linear and imposed by a trapezoidal fundamental diagram at\nevery NOIR road so that traffic feasibility is assured and traffic\nover-saturation is avoided. The success of the proposed traffic boundary\ncontrol is demonstrated by simulation of traffic congestion control in Downtown\nPhoenix.",

    "abstract": "Constraints solvers play a significant role in the analysis, synthesis, and\nformal verification of complex embedded and cyber-physical systems. In this\npaper, we study the problem of designing a scalable constraints solver for an\nimportant class of constraints named polynomial constraint inequalities (also\nknown as non-linear real arithmetic theory). In this paper, we introduce a\nsolver named PolyARBerNN that uses convex polynomials as abstractions for\nhighly nonlinear polynomials. Such abstractions were previously shown to be\npowerful to prune the search space and restrict the usage of sound and complete\nsolvers to small search spaces. Compared with the previous efforts on using\nconvex abstractions, PolyARBerNN provides three main contributions namely (i) a\nneural network guided abstraction refinement procedure that helps selecting the\nright abstraction out of a set of pre-defined abstractions, (ii) a Bernstein\npolynomial-based search space pruning mechanism that can be used to compute\ntight estimates of the polynomial maximum and minimum values which can be used\nas an additional abstraction of the polynomials, and (iii) an optimizer that\ntransforms polynomial objective functions into polynomial constraints (on the\ngradient of the objective function) whose solutions are guaranteed to be close\nto the global optima. These enhancements together allowed the PolyARBerNN\nsolver to solve complex instances and scales more favorably compared to the\nstate-of-art non-linear real arithmetic solvers while maintaining the soundness\nand completeness of the resulting solver. In particular, our test benches show\nthat PolyARBerNN achieved 100X speedup compared with Z3 8.9, Yices 2.6, and\nNASALib (a solver that uses Bernstein expansion to solve multivariate\npolynomial constraints) on a variety of standard test benches.",

In existing works, it is common to use a\nshared backbone to extract features for both things (countable classes such as\nvehicles) and stuff (uncountable classes such as roads). This, however, fails\nto capture the rich relations among them, which can be utilized to enhance\nvisual understanding and segmentation performance. To address this shortcoming,\nwe propose a novel Panoptic, Instance, and Semantic Relations (PISR) module to\nexploit such contexts. First, we generate panoptic encodings to summarize key\nfeatures of the semantic classes and predicted instances. A Panoptic Relational\nAttention (PRA) module is then applied to the encodings and the global feature\nmap from the backbone. It produces a feature map that captures 1) the relations\nacross semantic classes and instances and 2) the relations between these\npanoptic categories and spatial features. PISR also automatically learns to\nfocus on the more important instances, making it robust to the number of\ninstances used in the relational attention module. Moreover, PISR is a general\nmodule that can be applied to any existing panoptic segmentation architecture.\nThrough extensive evaluations on panoptic segmentation benchmarks like\nCityscapes, COCO, and ADE20K, we show that PISR attains considerable\nimprovements over existing approaches.",

Next we report laboratory-based compressive strength experiments\nfor five AI-generated formulations, which demonstrate that the formulations\nexceed design requirements. The resulting formulations were then used by Ozinga\nReady Mix -- a concrete supplier -- to generate field-ready concrete\nformulations, based on local conditions and their expertise in concrete design.\nFinally, we report on how these formulations were used in the construction of\nbuildings and structures in a Meta data center in DeKalb, IL, USA. Results from\nfield experiments as part of this real-world deployment corroborate the\nefficacy of AI-generated low-carbon concrete mixes.",

    "abstract": "We describe a method to jointly pre-train speech and text in an\nencoder-decoder modeling framework for speech translation and recognition. The\nproposed method incorporates four self-supervised and supervised subtasks for\ncross modality learning. A self-supervised speech subtask leverages unlabelled\nspeech data, and a (self-)supervised text to text subtask makes use of abundant\ntext training data. Two auxiliary supervised speech tasks are included to unify\nspeech and text modeling space. Our contribution lies in integrating linguistic\ninformation from the text corpus into the speech pre-training. Detailed\nanalysis reveals learning interference among subtasks. Two pre-training\nconfigurations for speech translation and recognition, respectively, are\npresented to alleviate subtask interference. Our experiments show the proposed\nmethod can effectively fuse speech and text information into one model. It\nachieves between 1.7 and 2.3 BLEU improvement above the state of the art on the\nMuST-C speech translation dataset and comparable WERs to wav2vec 2.0 on the\nLibrispeech speech recognition task.",

Recently, SNNs with\nbackpropagation through time (BPTT) have achieved a higher accuracy result on\nimage recognition tasks compared to other SNN training algorithms. Despite the\nsuccess on the algorithm perspective, prior works neglect the evaluation of the\nhardware energy overheads of BPTT, due to the lack of a hardware evaluation\nplatform for SNN training algorithm design. Moreover, although SNNs have been\nlong seen as an energy-efficient counterpart of ANNs, a quantitative comparison\nbetween the training cost of SNNs and ANNs is missing. To address the\nabove-mentioned issues, in this work, we introduce SATA (Sparsity-Aware\nTraining Accelerator), a BPTT-based training accelerator for SNNs. The proposed\nSATA provides a simple and re-configurable accelerator architecture for the\ngeneral-purpose hardware evaluation platform, which makes it easier to analyze\nthe training energy for SNN training algorithms. Based on SATA, we show\nquantitative analyses on the energy efficiency of SNN training and make a\ncomparison between the training cost of SNNs and ANNs. The results show that\nSNNs consume $1.27\\times$ more total energy with considering sparsity (spikes,\ngradient of firing function, and gradient of membrane potential) when compared\nto ANNs. We find that such high training energy cost is from time-repetitive\nconvolution operations and data movements during backpropagation.

The hybrid mode incurs a substantial\nCPU-to-GPU transfer time and relies on main memory bandwidth to feed embeddings\nto GPU for deep learning acceleration. Alternatively, we can store the entire\nembeddings across GPUs to avoid the transfer time and utilize the GPU's High\nBandwidth Memory (HBM). This approach requires GPU-to-GPU backend communication\nand scales the number of GPUs with the size of the embedding tables. To\novercome these concerns, this paper offers a heterogeneous acceleration\npipeline, called Hotline.\nHotline leverages the insight that only a small number of embedding entries\nare accessed frequently, and can easily fit in a single GPU's HBM. Hotline\nimplements a data-aware and model-aware scheduling pipeline that utilizes the\n(1) CPU main memory for not-frequently-accessed embeddings and (2) GPUs' local\nmemory for frequently-accessed embeddings. Hotline improves the training\nthroughput by dynamically stitching the execution of popular and not-popular\ninputs through a novel hardware accelerator and feeding to the GPUs.

Media narratives suggest that cultural innovations often originate\nin peripheral communities and then diffuse to the mainstream core; behavioral\nscience suggests that intermediate network positions that bridge between the\nperiphery and the core are especially likely to originate many influential\ncultural innovations. Research has yet to fully adjudicate between these\npredictions because prior work focuses on individual platforms such as Twitter;\nhowever, any single platform is only a small, incomplete part of the larger\nonline cultural ecosystem. In this paper, we perform the first analysis of the\norigins and diffusion of image memes at web scale, via a one-month crawl of all\nindexible online communities that principally share meme images with English\ntext overlays. Our results suggest that communities at the core of the network\noriginate the most highly diffused image memes: the top 10% of communities by\nnetwork centrality originate the memes that generate 62% of the image meme\ndiffusion events on the web. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression\nconfirms that memes from core communities are more likely to diffuse than those\nfrom peripheral communities even when controlling for community size and\nactivity level. However, a replication analysis that follows the traditional\napproach of testing the same question only within a single large community,\nReddit, finds the regression coefficients reversed -- underscoring the\nimportance of engaging in web-scale, cross-community analyses. The\necosystem-level viewpoint of this work positions the web as a highly\ncentralized generator of cultural artifacts such as image memes.",

    "abstract": "Enabling socially acceptable behavior for situated agents is a major goal of\nrecent robotics research. Robots should not only operate safely around humans,\nbut also abide by complex social norms. A key challenge for developing\nsocially-compliant policies is measuring the quality of their behavior. Social\nbehavior is enormously complex, making it difficult to create reliable metrics\nto gauge the performance of algorithms. In this paper, we propose a protocol\nfor social navigation benchmarking that defines a set of canonical social\nnavigation scenarios and an in-situ metric for evaluating performance on these\nscenarios using questionnaires. Our experiments show this protocol is\nrealistic, scalable, and repeatable across runs and physical spaces. Our\nprotocol can be replicated verbatim or it can be used to define a social\nnavigation benchmark for novel scenarios. Our goal is to introduce a protocol\nfor benchmarking social scenarios that is homogeneous and comparable.",

In this work, we\npropose a stochastic attention mechanism for NPs to capture appropriate context\ninformation.

    "abstract": "Multimodal data collected from the real world are often imperfect due to\nmissing modalities. Therefore multimodal models that are robust against\nmodal-incomplete data are highly preferred. Recently, Transformer models have\nshown great success in processing multimodal data. However, existing work has\nbeen limited to either architecture designs or pre-training strategies; whether\nTransformer models are naturally robust against missing-modal data has rarely\nbeen investigated. In this paper, we present the first-of-its-kind work to\ncomprehensively investigate the behavior of Transformers in the presence of\nmodal-incomplete data. Unsurprising, we find Transformer models are sensitive\nto missing modalities while different modal fusion strategies will\nsignificantly affect the robustness. What surprised us is that the optimal\nfusion strategy is dataset dependent even for the same Transformer model; there\ndoes not exist a universal strategy that works in general cases. Based on these\nfindings, we propose a principle method to improve the robustness of\nTransformer models by automatically searching for an optimal fusion strategy\nregarding input data. Experimental validations on three benchmarks support the\nsuperior performance of the proposed method.",

However, most existing methods, especially those\ntargeted on image classification, only work in a simplified scenario by\nassuming all new data belong to new tasks, which is not realistic if the class\nlabels are not provided. Therefore, to perform unsupervised continual learning\nin real life applications, an out-of-distribution detector is required at\nbeginning to identify whether each new data corresponds to a new task or\nalready learned tasks, which still remains under-explored yet.

In PKA, a user manages private keys\non her devices called authenticators, and services bind the corresponding\npublic keys to her account. To protect private keys, a user uses authenticators\nwhich never export private keys outside. On the other hand, a user regularly\nuses multiple authenticators like PCs and smartphones. She replaces some of her\nauthenticators according to their lifecycle, such as purchasing new devices and\nlosing devices. It is a burden for a user to register, update and revoke public\nkeys in many services every time she registers new accounts with services and\nreplaces some of her authenticators. To ease the burden, we propose a mechanism\nwhere users and services manage public keys based on the owner of\nauthenticators and users can access services with PKA using any of their\nauthenticators. We introduce a key pair called an Ownership Verification Key\n(OVK), which consists of the private key (OVSK) and the corresponding public\nkey (OVPK). All authenticators owned by a user derive the same OVSK from the\npre-shared secret called the seed. Services verify the ownership of the\nauthenticators using the corresponding OVPK to determine whether binding the\nrequested public key to her account. To protect user privacy while maintaining\nconvenience, authenticators generate a different OVK for each service from the\nseed independently.

While screening decisions vary across child race, we do\nnot find evidence of racial differences in the relationship between worker\nexperience and screening decisions.

    "abstract": "Place recognition or loop closure detection is one of the core components in\na full SLAM system. In this paper, aiming at strengthening the relevancy of\nlocal neighboring points and the contextual dependency among global points\nsimultaneously, we investigate the exploitation of transformer-based network\nfor feature extraction, and propose a Hierarchical Transformer for Place\nRecognition (HiTPR). The HiTPR consists of four major parts: point cell\ngeneration, short-range transformer (SRT), long-range transformer (LRT) and\nglobal descriptor aggregation. Specifically, the point cloud is initially\ndivided into a sequence of small cells by downsampling and nearest neighbors\nsearching. In the SRT, we extract the local feature for each point cell. While\nin the LRT, we build the global dependency among all of the point cells in the\nwhole point cloud. Experiments on several standard benchmarks demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the HiTPR in terms of average recall rate, achieving 93.71% at\ntop 1% and 86.63% at top 1 on the Oxford RobotCar dataset for example.",

In beginning, we apply a document layout\nanalysis that combining traditional and modern technics to segment layout in\nblocks of various types appropriately. Then we transform this issue to a\nproblem of layout graph matching with textual awareness. About graph matching,\nit is a long-studied problem with a broad range of applications. However,\ndifferent from previous works focusing on visual images or structural layout,\nwe also bring textual features into our model for adapting this domain.\nSpecifically, based on the electronic document, we introduce an encoder to deal\nwith the visual presentation decoding from PDF. Additionally, because the\nmodifications can cause the inconsistency of document layout analysis between\nmodified documents and the blocks can be merged and split, Sinkhorn divergence\nis adopted in our graph neural approach, which tries to overcome both these\nissues with many-to-many block matching.

    "abstract": "Given a sequence of sets, where each set is associated with a timestamp and\ncontains an arbitrary number of elements, the task of temporal sets prediction\naims to predict the elements in the subsequent set. Previous studies for\ntemporal sets prediction mainly capture each user's evolutionary preference by\nlearning from his/her own sequence. Although insightful, we argue that: 1) the\ncollaborative signals latent in different users' sequences are essential but\nhave not been exploited; 2) users also tend to show stationary preferences\nwhile existing methods fail to consider. To this end, we propose an integrated\nlearning framework to model both the evolutionary and the stationary\npreferences of users for temporal sets prediction, which first constructs a\nuniversal sequence by chronologically arranging all the user-set interactions,\nand then learns on each user-set interaction. In particular, for each user-set\ninteraction, we first design an evolutionary user preference modelling\ncomponent to track the user's time-evolving preference and exploit the latent\ncollaborative signals among different users. This component maintains a memory\nbank to store memories of the related user and elements, and continuously\nupdates their memories based on the currently encoded messages and the past\nmemories. Then, we devise a stationary user preference modelling module to\ndiscover each user's personalized characteristics according to the historical\nsequence, which adaptively aggregates the previously interacted elements from\ndual perspectives with the guidance of the user's and elements' embeddings.\nFinally, we develop a set-batch algorithm to improve the model efficiency,\nwhich can create time-consistent batches in advance and achieve 3.5x training\nspeedups on average.

Practical settings require dynamic exchanges between human and\nAI agent wherein feedback is provided in an online manner, a few at a time. In\nthis paper, we introduce a new framework to train summarization models with\npreference feedback interactively.

    "abstract": "Focusing on the task of point-to-point navigation for an autonomous driving\nvehicle, we propose a novel deep learning model trained with end-to-end and\nmulti-task learning manners to perform both perception and control tasks\nsimultaneously. The model is used to drive the ego vehicle safely by following\na sequence of routes defined by the global planner. The perception part of the\nmodel is used to encode high-dimensional observation data provided by an RGBD\ncamera while performing semantic segmentation, semantic depth cloud (SDC)\nmapping, and traffic light state and stop sign prediction. Then, the control\npart decodes the encoded features along with additional information provided by\nGPS and speedometer to predict waypoints that come with a latent feature space.\nFurthermore, two agents are employed to process these outputs and make a\ncontrol policy that determines the level of steering, throttle, and brake as\nthe final action. The model is evaluated on CARLA simulator with various\nscenarios made of normal-adversarial situations and different weathers to mimic\nreal-world conditions. In addition, we do a comparative study with some recent\nmodels to justify the performance in multiple aspects of driving. Moreover, we\nalso conduct an ablation study on SDC mapping and multi-agent to understand\ntheir roles and behavior. As a result, our model achieves the highest driving\nscore even with fewer parameters and computation load.

Previous research works rarely\nconsider token-level feature fusion, and few works explore learning the common\nfeatures related to sentiment in multimodal data to help the model fuse\nmultimodal features. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive Learning and\nMulti-Layer Fusion (CLMLF) method for multimodal sentiment detection.\nSpecifically, we first encode text and image to obtain hidden representations,\nand then use a multi-layer fusion module to align and fuse the token-level\nfeatures of text and image. In addition to the sentiment analysis task, we also\ndesigned two contrastive learning tasks, label based contrastive learning and\ndata based contrastive learning tasks, which will help the model learn common\nfeatures related to sentiment in multimodal data.

Can we estimate the cost of each query more efficiently without any\ncomputation in a SQL engine kernel? Can machine learning techniques help to\nestimate SQL query resource utilization? The answers are yes. We propose a SQL\nquery cost predictor service, which employs machine learning techniques to\ntrain models from historical query request logs and rapidly forecasts the CPU\nand memory resource usages of online queries without any computation in a SQL\nengine. At Twitter, infrastructure engineers are maintaining a large-scale SQL\nfederation system across on-premises and cloud data centers for serving ad-hoc\nqueries. The proposed service can help to improve query scheduling by relieving\nthe issue of imbalanced online analytical processing (OLAP) workloads in the\nSQL engine clusters. It can also assist in enabling preemptive scaling.\nAdditionally, the proposed approach uses plain SQL statements for the model\ntraining and online prediction, indicating it is both hardware and\nsoftware-agnostic. The method can be generalized to broader SQL systems and\nheterogeneous environments.

Bidirectional\nrecurrent networks (BiRNN) have exhibited appealing performance in several\nvideo restoration tasks. However, BiRNN is intrinsically offline because it\nuses backward recurrent modules to propagate from the last to current frames,\nwhich causes high latency and large memory consumption. To address the offline\nissue of BiRNN, we present a novel recurrent network consisting of forward and\nlook-ahead recurrent modules for unidirectional video denoising. Particularly,\nlook-ahead module is an elaborate forward module for leveraging information\nfrom near-future frames. When denoising the current frame, the hidden features\nby forward and look-ahead recurrent modules are combined, thereby making it\nfeasible to exploit both historical and near-future frames. Due to the scene\nmotion between non-neighboring frames, border pixels missing may occur when\nwarping look-ahead feature from near-future frame to current frame, which can\nbe largely alleviated by incorporating forward warping and border enlargement.\nExperiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with\nconstant latency and memory consumption.

Under open-set scenarios, the intractable bias in contextual\ninformation can be passed down to visual information, consequently impairing\nthe classification performance. In this paper, a Character-Context Decoupling\nframework is proposed to alleviate this problem by separating contextual\ninformation and character-visual information. Contextual information can be\ndecomposed into temporal information and linguistic information. Here, temporal\ninformation that models character order and word length is isolated with a\ndetached temporal attention module. Linguistic information that models n-gram\nand other linguistic statistics is separated with a decoupled context anchor\nmechanism.

    "title": "Delving Deep into Regularity: A Simple but Effective Method for Chinese  Named Entity Recognition",
    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the improving performance of Chinese Named Entity\nRecognition (NER) from proposing new frameworks or incorporating word lexicons.\nHowever, the inner composition of entity mentions in character-level Chinese\nNER has been rarely studied. Actually, most mentions of regular types have\nstrong name regularity. For example, entities end with indicator words such as\n\"company\" or \"bank\" usually belong to organization. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple but effective method for investigating the regularity of entity spans in\nChinese NER, dubbed as Regularity-Inspired reCOgnition Network (RICON).\nSpecifically, the proposed model consists of two branches: a regularity-aware\nmodule and a regularityagnostic module. The regularity-aware module captures\nthe internal regularity of each span for better entity type prediction, while\nthe regularity-agnostic module is employed to locate the boundary of entities\nand relieve the excessive attention to span regularity. An orthogonality space\nis further constructed to encourage two modules to extract different aspects of\nregularity features. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct\nextensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and a practical medical\ndataset. The experimental results show that our RICON significantly outperforms\nprevious state-of-the-art methods, including various lexicon-based methods.",

    "title": "A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Electric Vehicle Routing Problem  with Vehicle-to-Grid Supply",
    "abstract": "The use of electric vehicles (EV) in the last mile is appealing from both\nsustainability and operational cost perspectives. In addition to the inherent\ncost efficiency of EVs, selling energy back to the grid during peak grid\ndemand, is a potential source of additional revenue to a fleet operator. To\nachieve this, EVs have to be at specific locations (discharge points) during\nspecific points in time (peak period), even while meeting their core purpose of\ndelivering goods to customers. In this work, we consider the problem of EV\nrouting with constraints on loading capacity; time window; vehicle-to-grid\nenergy supply (CEVRPTW-D); which not only satisfy multiple system objectives,\nbut also scale efficiently to large problem sizes involving hundreds of\ncustomers and discharge stations. We present QuikRouteFinder that uses\nreinforcement learning (RL) for EV routing to overcome these challenges. Using\nSolomon datasets, results from RL are compared against exact formulations based\non mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and genetic algorithm (GA)\nmetaheuristics. On an average, the results show that RL is 24 times faster than\nMILP and GA, while being close in quality (within 20%) to the optimal.",

    "title": "Undoing the Damage of Label Shift for Cross-domain Semantic Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Existing works typically treat cross-domain semantic segmentation (CDSS) as a\ndata distribution mismatch problem and focus on aligning the marginal\ndistribution or conditional distribution. However, the label shift issue is\nunfortunately overlooked, which actually commonly exists in the CDSS task, and\noften causes a classifier bias in the learnt model. In this paper, we give an\nin-depth analysis and show that the damage of label shift can be overcome by\naligning the data conditional distribution and correcting the posterior\nprobability. To this end, we propose a novel approach to undo the damage of the\nlabel shift problem in CDSS. In implementation, we adopt class-level feature\nalignment for conditional distribution alignment, as well as two simple yet\neffective methods to rectify the classifier bias from source to target by\nremolding the classifier predictions. We conduct extensive experiments on the\nbenchmark datasets of urban scenes, including GTA5 to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to\nCityscapes, where our proposed approach outperforms previous methods by a large\nmargin. For instance, our model equipped with a self-training strategy reaches\n59.3% mIoU on GTA5 to Cityscapes, pushing to a new state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "Recent Knowledge distillation (KD) studies show that different manually\ndesigned schemes impact the learned results significantly. Yet, in KD,\nautomatically searching an optimal distillation scheme has not yet been well\nexplored. In this paper, we propose DistPro, a novel framework which searches\nfor an optimal KD process via differentiable meta-learning. Specifically, given\na pair of student and teacher networks, DistPro first sets up a rich set of KD\nconnection from the transmitting layers of the teacher to the receiving layers\nof the student, and in the meanwhile, various transforms are also proposed for\ncomparing feature maps along its pathway for the distillation. Then, each\ncombination of a connection and a transform choice (pathway) is associated with\na stochastic weighting process which indicates its importance at every step\nduring the distillation. In the searching stage, the process can be effectively\nlearned through our proposed bi-level meta-optimization strategy. In the\ndistillation stage, DistPro adopts the learned processes for knowledge\ndistillation, which significantly improves the student accuracy especially when\nfaster training is required. Lastly, we find the learned processes can be\ngeneralized between similar tasks and networks. In our experiments, DistPro\nproduces state-of-the-art (SoTA) accuracy under varying number of learning\nepochs on popular datasets, i.e. CIFAR100 and ImageNet, which demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework.",

    "title": "Galactic Token Sliding",
    "abstract": "Given a graph $G$ and two independent sets $I_s$ and $I_t$ of size $k$, the\nindependent set reconfiguration problem asks whether there exists a sequence of\n$k$-sized independent sets $I_s = I_0, I_1, I_2, \\ldots, I_\\ell = I_t$ such\nthat each independent set is obtained from the previous one using a so-called\nreconfiguration step. Viewing each independent set as a collection of $k$\ntokens placed on the vertices of a graph $G$, the two most studied\nreconfiguration steps are token jumping and token sliding. In the token jumping\nvariant of the problem, a single step allows a token to jump from one vertex to\nany other vertex in the graph. In the token sliding variant, a token is only\nallowed to slide from a vertex to one of its neighbors. Like the independent\nset problem, both of the aforementioned problems are known to be W[1]-hard on\ngeneral graphs. A very fruitful line of research has showed that the\nindependent set problem becomes fixed-parameter tractable when restricted to\nsparse graph classes, such as planar, bounded treewidth, nowhere-dense, and all\nthe way to biclique-free graphs. Over a series of papers, the same was shown to\nhold for the token jumping problem. As for the token sliding problem, which is\nmentioned in most of these papers, almost nothing is known beyond the fact that\nthe problem is polynomial-time solvable on trees and interval graphs. We remedy\nthis situation by introducing a new model for the reconfiguration of\nindependent sets, which we call galactic reconfiguration. Using this new model,\nwe show that (standard) token sliding is fixed-parameter tractable on graphs of\nbounded degree, planar graphs, and chordal graphs of bounded clique number. We\nbelieve that the galactic reconfiguration model is of independent interest and\ncould potentially help in resolving the remaining open questions concerning the\n(parameterized) complexity of token sliding.",

    "abstract": "Despite non-co-location, haptic stimulation at the wrist can potentially\nprovide feedback regarding interactions at the fingertips without encumbering\nthe user's hand. Here we investigate how two types of skin deformation at the\nwrist (normal and shear) relate to the perception of the mechanical properties\nof virtual objects. We hypothesized that a congruent mapping between force at\nthe fingertips and deformation at the wrist would be better, i.e. mapping\nfinger normal force to skin indentation at the wrist, and shear force to skin\nshear at the wrist, would result in better perception than other mappings that\neither mixed or merged the two direction into a single type of feedback. We\nperformed an experiment where haptic devices at the wrist rendered either\nnormal or shear feedback during manipulation of virtual objects with varying\nstiffness, mass, or friction properties. Perception of mechanical properties\nwas more accurate with congruent skin stimulation than noncongruent. In\naddition, discrimination performance and subjective reports were positively\ninfluenced by congruence.

    "abstract": "For fast timescales or long prediction horizons, the AC optimal power flow\n(OPF) problem becomes a computational challenge for large-scale, realistic AC\nnetworks. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a novel network\nreduction methodology that leverages an efficient mixed-integer linear\nprogramming (MILP) formulation of a Kron-based reduction that is optimal in the\nsense that it balances the degree of the reduction with resulting modeling\nerrors in the reduced network. The method takes as inputs the full AC network\nand a pre-computed library of AC load flow data and uses the graph Laplacian to\nconstraint nodal reductions to only be feasible for neighbors of non-reduced\nnodes. This results in a highly effective MILP formulation which is embedded\nwithin an iterative scheme to successively improve the Kron-based network\nreduction until convergence. The resulting optimal network reduction is, thus,\ngrounded in the physics of the full network. The accuracy of the network\nreduction methodology is then explored for a 100+ node medium-voltage\ndistribution feeder example across a wide range of operating conditions. It is\nfinally shown that a network reduction of 25-85% can be achieved within seconds\nand with worst-case voltage magnitude deviation errors within any super node\ncluster of less than 0.01pu. These results illustrate that the proposed\noptimization-based approach to Kron reduction of networks is viable for larger\nnetworks and suitable for use within various power system applications.",

Finding total quantity in a\nproduct is required for computing PPU, which is not always provided by the\nsellers. To predict total quantity, all relevant quantities given in a product\nattributes such as title, description and image need to be inferred correctly.\nWe formulate this problem as a question-answering (QA) task rather than named\nentity recognition (NER) task for fact extraction. In our QA approach, we first\npredict the unit of measure (UoM) type (e.g., volume, weight or count), that\nformulates the desired question (e.g., \"What is the total volume?\") and then\nuse this question to find all the relevant answers.

We\nuse a deep character-level CNN architecture for both subtasks, which enables\n(1) easy expansion to new stores with similar alphabets, (2) multi-span\nanswering due to its span-image architecture and (3) easy deployment by keeping\nmodel-inference latency low.

However, federated graph learning (FGL), even though\ngraph data are prevalent, has not been well supported due to its unique\ncharacteristics and requirements.

    "abstract": "Low-rankness plays an important role in traditional machine learning, but is\nnot so popular in deep learning. Most previous low-rank network compression\nmethods compress the networks by approximating pre-trained models and\nre-training. However, optimal solution in the Euclidean space may be quite\ndifferent from the one in the low-rank manifold. A well pre-trained model is\nnot a good initialization for the model with low-rank constraint. Thus, the\nperformance of low-rank compressed network degrades significantly. Compared to\nother network compression methods such as pruning, low-rank methods attracts\nless attention in recent years. In this paper, we devise a new training method,\nlow-rank projection with energy transfer (LRPET), that trains low-rank\ncompressed networks from scratch and achieves competitive performance. First,\nwe propose to alternately perform stochastic gradient descent training and\nprojection onto the low-rank manifold. This asymptotically approaches the\noptimal solution in the low-rank manifold. Compared to re-training on compact\nmodel, this enables fully utilization of model capacity since solution space is\nrelaxed back to Euclidean space after projection. Second, the matrix energy\n(the sum of squares of singular values) reduction caused by projection is\ncompensated by energy transfer. We uniformly transfer the energy of the pruned\nsingular values to the remaining ones. We theoretically show that energy\ntransfer eases the trend of gradient vanishing caused by projection.\nComprehensive experiment on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet have justified that our\nmethod is superior to other low-rank compression methods and also outperforms\nrecent state-of-the-art pruning methods.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing advancements in video compression efficiency achieved by\nnewer codecs such as HEVC, AV1, and VVC, and intelligent encoding strategies,\nas well as improved bandwidth availability,there has been a proliferation and\nacceptance of newer services such as Netflix, Twitch, etc. However, such higher\ncompression efficiencies are achieved at the cost of higher complexity and\nencoding delay, while many applications are delay sensitive. Hence, there is a\nrequirement for faster, more efficient codecs to achieve higher encoding\nefficiency without significant trade-off in terms of both complexity and speed.\nWe present in this work an evaluation of the latest MPEG-5 Part 2 Low\nComplexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC) for live gaming video streaming\napplications. The results are presented in terms of bitrate savings using both\nsubjective and objective quality measures as well as a comparison of the\nencoding speeds. Our results indicate that, for the encoding settings used in\nthis work, LCEVC outperforms both x264 and x265 codecs in terms of bitrate\nsavings using VMAF by approximately 42\\% and 38\\%. Using subjective results, it\nis found that LCEVC outperforms the respective base codecs, especially for low\nbitrates. This effect is more evident for x264 than for x265, i.e., for the\nlatter the absolute improvement of quality scores is smaller.

Early detection is crucial, allowing\ntimely intervention which can prevent further visual field loss. To detect\nglaucoma, examination of the optic nerve head via fundus imaging can be\nperformed, at the centre of which is the assessment of the optic cup and disc\nboundaries. Fundus imaging is non-invasive and low-cost; however, the image\nexamination relies on subjective, time-consuming, and costly expert\nassessments. A timely question to ask is can artificial intelligence mimic\nglaucoma assessments made by experts. Namely, can artificial intelligence\nautomatically find the boundaries of the optic cup and disc (providing a\nso-called segmented fundus image) and then use the segmented image to identify\nglaucoma with high accuracy. We conducted a comprehensive review on artificial\nintelligence-enabled glaucoma detection frameworks that produce and use\nsegmented fundus images. We found 28 papers and identified two main approaches:\n1) logical rule-based frameworks, based on a set of simplistic decision rules;\nand 2) machine learning/statistical modelling based frameworks.

With this in mind, we offer a new\ndiscriminability-and-equity maximization paradigm built on squares loss, such\nthat predictions are equalized explicitly. To verify its feasibility and\nflexibility, two new losses termed Class Weighted Squares Maximization (CWSM)\nand Normalized Squares Maximization (NSM), are proposed to maximize both\npredictive discriminability and equity, from the class level and the sample\nlevel, respectively. Importantly, we theoretically relate these two novel\nlosses (i.e., CWSM and NSM) to the equity maximization under mild conditions,\nand empirically suggest the importance of the predictive equity in UDA.\nMoreover, it is very efficient to realize the equity constraints in both\nlosses.

Our HyperDet3D achieves state-of-the-art results on the 3D object\ndetection benchmark of the ScanNet and SUN RGB-D datasets.

Then, we\nstudy the representation of predicted objects in an unsupervised manner and\ndiscover new categories from the set of unknown objects.

In the recent past, research\nfocused extensively on non-invasive PPG-based approaches to blood pressure (BP)\nestimation. These approaches can be subdivided into regression and\nclassification methods. The latter assign PPG signals to predefined BP\nintervals that represent clinically relevant ranges. The former predict\nsystolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BP as continuous variables and are of\nparticular interest to the research community. However, the reported accuracies\nof BP regression methods vary widely among publications with some authors even\nquestioning the feasibility of PPG-based BP regression altogether. In our work,\nwe compare BP regression and classification approaches. We argue that BP\nclassification might provide diagnostic value that is equivalent to regression\nin many clinically relevant scenarios while being similar or even superior in\nterms of performance. We compare several established neural architectures using\npublicly available PPG data for SBP regression and classification with and\nwithout personalization using subject-specific data.

However, another common use case for practitioners is to learn\nfrom data that resembles demonstrations. In this case, one can choose to apply\noffline RL, but can also use behavioral cloning (BC) algorithms, which mimic a\nsubset of the dataset via supervised learning. Therefore, it seems natural to\nask: when can an offline RL method outperform BC with an equal amount of expert\ndata, even when BC is a natural choice? To answer this question, we\ncharacterize the properties of environments that allow offline RL methods to\nperform better than BC methods, even when only provided with expert data.\nAdditionally, we show that policies trained on sufficiently noisy suboptimal\ndata can attain better performance than even BC algorithms with expert data,\nespecially on long-horizon problems.

It relies on three major premises\nregarding visual aesthetics: (i) that an individual has different preferences\nfor different aesthetic stimuli; (ii) that these preferences are relatively\nconsistent; and (iii) that aesthetic tastes are subjective and, therefore,\nthere are considerable individual differences in aesthetic preferences.\nFollowing a review of the scientific basis for these premises, we describe the\nconcept of the aesthetic evaluation-based authentication (AEbA) method and\nillustrate an implementation of it. We address AEbA's advantages and\ndisadvantages relative to other related methods and conclude that it is\nadequate for low-to-medium security domains. It cannot serve as a compulsory\nmethod because we suspect that a certain portion of the user population lacks\nthe degree of aesthetic sensitivity required to use the system effectively. On\nthe plus side, the method offers a positive experience. It alleviates the\nburden of memorizing passwords to a minimum, and relative to other\nusability-oriented schemes provides better security in terms of\nshoulder-surfing, phishing, and password space.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the challenging instance-wise vision-language tasks,\nwhere the free-form language is required to align with the objects instead of\nthe whole image. To address these tasks, we propose X-DETR, whose architecture\nhas three major components: an object detector, a language encoder, and\nvision-language alignment. The vision and language streams are independent\nuntil the end and they are aligned using an efficient dot-product operation.\nThe whole network is trained end-to-end, such that the detector is optimized\nfor the vision-language tasks instead of an off-the-shelf component. To\novercome the limited size of paired object-language annotations, we leverage\nother weak types of supervision to expand the knowledge coverage. This simple\nyet effective architecture of X-DETR shows good accuracy and fast speeds for\nmultiple instance-wise vision-language tasks, e.g., 16.4 AP on LVIS detection\nof 1.2K categories at ~20 frames per second without using any LVIS annotation\nduring training.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a delay-compensated feedback controller based on proximal\npolicy optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning to stabilize traffic flow in\nthe congested regime by manipulating the time-gap of adaptive cruise\ncontrol-equipped (ACC-equipped) vehicles.The traffic dynamics on a freeway\nsegment are governed by an Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model, consisting of $2\\times\n2$ nonlinear first-order partial differential equations (PDEs).Inspired by the\nbackstepping delay compensator [18] but different from whose complex segmented\ncontrol scheme, the PPO control is composed of three feedbacks, namely the\ncurrent traffic flow velocity, the current traffic flow density and previous\none step control input. The control gains for the three feedbacks are learned\nfrom the interaction between the PPO and the numerical simulator of the traffic\nsystem without knowing the system dynamics. Numerical simulation experiments\nare designed to compare the Lyapunov control, the backstepping control and the\nPPO control. The results show that for a delay-free system, the PPO control has\nfaster convergence rate and less control effort than the Lyapunov control. For\na traffic system with input delay, the performance of the PPO controller is\ncomparable to that of the Backstepping controller, even for the situation that\nthe delay value does not match. However, the PPO is robust to parameter\nperturbations, while the Backstepping controller cannot stabilize a system\nwhere one of the parameters is disturbed by Gaussian noise.",

Equivalently, for $r=3$, if two\nvertices in an edge are assigned the same colour, then the third vertex is\nassigned a larger colour (as opposed to a different colour, as in classic\nnon-monochromatic colouring). Barto, Battistelli, and Berg [STACS'21] studied\nLO colourings on $3$-uniform hypergraphs in the context of promise constraint\nsatisfaction problems (PCSPs). We show two results.\nFirst, given a $3$-uniform hypergraph that admits an LO $2$-colouring, one\ncan find in polynomial time an LO $k$-colouring with $k=O(\\sqrt{n\\log\\log\nn}/\\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the input hypergraph. This\nis established by building on ideas from algorithms designed for approximate\ngraph colourings.\nSecond, given an $r$-uniform hypergraph that admits an LO $2$-colouring, we\nestablish NP-hardness of finding an LO $k$-colouring for every constant\nuniformity $r\\geq k+2$. In fact, we determine relationships between\npolymorphism minions for all uniformities $r\\geq 3$, which reveals a key\ndifference between $r<k+2$ and $r\\geq k+2$ and which may be of independent\ninterest. Using the algebraic approach to PCSPs, we actually show a more\ngeneral result establishing NP-hardness of finding an LO $\\ell$-colouring for\nLO $k$-colourable $r$-uniform hypergraphs for $2 \\leq k \\leq \\ell$ and $r \\geq\n\\ell - k + 4$.",

In a series of works, the authors have promoted the use of\nsymbolic executions combined with machine learning to avoid such traps. Most of\nthose works rely on natural graph-based representations that can then be\nplugged into graph-based learning algorithms such as Gspan. There are two main\nproblems with this approach. The first one is in the cost of computing the\ngraph. Indeed, working with graphs requires one to compute and representing the\nentire state-space of the file under analysis. As such computation is too\ncumbersome, the techniques often rely on developing strategies to compute a\nrepresentative subgraph of the behaviors. Unfortunately, efficient\ngraph-building strategies remain weakly explored. The second problem is in the\nclassification itself. Graph-based machine learning algorithms rely on\ncomparing the biggest common structures. This sidelines small but specific\nparts of the malware signature. In addition, it does not allow us to work with\nefficient algorithms such as support vector machine. We propose a new efficient\nopen source toolchain for machine learning-based classification. We also\nexplore how graph-kernel techniques can be used in the process. We focus on the\n1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel, which can capture local similarities\nbetween graphs.

    "abstract": "The aim of idiomify is to build a collocation-supplemented reverse dictionary\nof idioms for the non-native learners of English. We aim to do so because the\nreverse dictionary could help the non-natives explore idioms on demand, and the\ncollocations could also guide them on using idioms more adequately. The\ncornerstone of the project is a reliable way of mining idioms from corpora,\nwhich is however a challenge because idioms extensively vary in forms. We\ntackle this by automatically deriving matching rules from their base forms. We\nuse Point-wise Mutual Inclusion (PMI), Term Frequency - Inverse Document\nFrequency (TF-IDF) to model collocations, since both of them are popular metric\nfor pairwise significance. We also try Term Frequency (TF) as the baseline\nmodel. As for implementing the reverse-dictionary, three approaches could be\ntaken: inverted index, graphs and distributional semantics. We choose to take\nthe last approach and implement the reverse dictionary with Word2Vec, because\nit is the most flexible approach of all and Word2Vec is a simple yet strong\nbaseline. Evaluating the methods has revealed rooms for improvement. We learn\nthat we can better identify idioms with the help of slop, wildcard and\nreordering techniques. We also learn that we can get the best of both PMI and\nTF-IDF if we use machine learning to find the sweet spot. Lastly, We learn that\nIdiomify could be further improved with a mixture of inverted index and\ndistributional semantics approach. The limits aside, the proposed methods are\nfeasible, and their benefits to the non-natives are apparent, which therefore\ncan be used to aid the non-natives in acquiring English idioms.",

The best\nchoice in discretization method greatly depends on the environment. However,\nthe discretize regularize unit (DRU), straight through DRU and the straight\nthrough gumbel softmax show the most consistent results across all the tested\nenvironments. Therefore, these methods prove to be the best choice for general\nuse while the straight through estimator and the gumbel softmax may provide\nbetter results in specific environments but fail completely in others.",

This success has in turn\nprompted research that reveals a number of biases in the language models\ngenerated by transformers. In this paper we utilize this research on biases to\ninvestigate to what extent transformer-based language models allow for\nextracting knowledge about object relations (X occurs in Y; X consists of Z;\naction A involves using X). To this end, we compare contextualized models with\ntheir static counterparts. We make this comparison dependent on the application\nof a number of similarity measures and classifiers. Our results are threefold:\nFirstly, we show that the models combined with the different similarity\nmeasures differ greatly in terms of the amount of knowledge they allow for\nextracting. Secondly, our results suggest that similarity measures perform much\nworse than classifier-based approaches. Thirdly, we show that, surprisingly,\nstatic models perform almost as well as contextualized models -- in some cases\neven better.",

    "abstract": "The lack of resolution has a negative impact on the performance of\nimage-based biometrics. Many applications which are becoming ubiquitous in\nmobile devices do not operate in a controlled environment, and their\nperformance significantly drops due to the lack of pixel resolution. While many\ngeneric super-resolution techniques have been studied to restore low-resolution\nimages for biometrics, the results obtained are not always as desired. Those\ngeneric methods are usually aimed to enhance the visual appearance of the\nscene. However, producing an overall visual enhancement of biometric images\ndoes not necessarily correlate with a better recognition performance. Such\ntechniques are designed to restore generic images and therefore do not exploit\nthe specific structure found in biometric images (e.g. iris or faces), which\ncauses the solution to be sub-optimal. For this reason, super-resolution\ntechniques have to be adapted for the particularities of images from a specific\nbiometric modality. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in\nthe application of super-resolution to different biometric modalities, such as\nface iris, gait or fingerprint. This chapter presents an overview of recent\nadvances in super-resolution reconstruction of face and iris images, which are\nthe two prevalent modalities in selfie biometrics. We also provide experimental\nresults using several state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms, demonstrating\nthe benefits of using super-resolution to improve the quality of face and iris\nimages prior to classification.

Several works have demonstrated that using\nrepertoires of pre-trained skills can enable robots to adapt to unforeseen\nmechanical damages in a few minutes. These adaptation capabilities are directly\nlinked to the behavioural diversity in the repertoire. The more alternatives\nthe robot has to execute a skill, the better are the chances that it can adapt\nto a new situation. However, solving complex tasks, like maze navigation,\nusually requires multiple different skills. Finding a large behavioural\ndiversity for these multiple skills often leads to an intractable exponential\ngrowth of the number of required solutions. In this paper, we introduce the\nHierarchical Trial and Error algorithm, which uses a hierarchical behavioural\nrepertoire to learn diverse skills and leverages them to make the robot more\nadaptive to different situations. We show that the hierarchical decomposition\nof skills enables the robot to learn more complex behaviours while keeping the\nlearning of the repertoire tractable.

Empirically, we compare\nour map representation with a couple of popular map representation methods in\nrobotics and autonomous driving societies, and our map representation is more\nfavorable in terms of efficiency, scalability and compactness. In addition, we\nalso evaluate localization accuracy extensively given the created LiDAR\nRoad-Atlas representations on several public benchmark datasets. With a\n16-channel LiDAR sensor, our method achieves an average global localization\nerrors of 0.26m (translation) and 1.07 degrees (rotation) on the Apollo\ndataset, and 0.89m (translation) and 1.29 degrees (rotation) on the MulRan\ndataset, respectively, at 10Hz, which validates the promising performance of\nour map representation for autonomous driving.",

However, they cannot handle the ever-changing\nclinical environment, bringing newly annotated medical data from different\nsources. To exploit the incoming streams of data, these models would benefit\nlargely from sequentially learning from new samples, without forgetting the\npreviously obtained knowledge. In this paper we introduce LifeLonger, a\nbenchmark for continual disease classification on the MedMNIST collection, by\napplying existing state-of-the-art continual learning methods. In particular,\nwe consider three continual learning scenarios, namely, task and class\nincremental learning and the newly defined cross-domain incremental learning.\nTask and class incremental learning of diseases address the issue of\nclassifying new samples without re-training the models from scratch, while\ncross-domain incremental learning addresses the issue of dealing with datasets\noriginating from different institutions while retaining the previously obtained\nknowledge. We perform a thorough analysis of the performance and examine how\nthe well-known challenges of continual learning, such as the catastrophic\nforgetting exhibit themselves in this setting. The encouraging results\ndemonstrate that continual learning has a major potential to advance disease\nclassification and to produce a more robust and efficient learning framework\nfor clinical settings.

This paper proposes a fuzzy logic-based approach for\nreducing the amount of energy spent in indoor temperature and humidity\nmonitoring systems by filtering data that is sent to servers based on several\nsurrounding circumstances such as time of data recording and current energy\nconsumption amount while maintaining constant monitoring.

The algorithm needs to utilize probabilistic rankings of\nthe items within $m$-sized subsets to accurately determine which items are the\noverall top-$k$ items in a total of $n$ items. The Borda counting algorithm\nsimply counts the cumulative scores for each item from these partial ranking\nobservations. This generalizes a previous work of a similar nature by Shah et\nal. using probabilistic pairwise comparison data. The performance of the Borda\ncounting algorithm critically depends on the associated score separation\n$\\Delta_k$ between the $k$-th item and the $(k+1)$-th item. Specifically, we\nshow that if $\\Delta_k$ is greater than certain value, then the top-$k$ items\nselected by the algorithm is asymptotically accurate almost surely; if\n$\\Delta_k$ is below certain value, then the result will be inaccurate with a\nconstant probability. In the special case of $m=2$, i.e., pairwise comparison,\nthe resultant bound is tighter than that given by Shah et al., leading to a\nreduced gap between the error probability upper and lower bounds. These results\nare further extended to the approximate top-$k$ selection setting.

Our method is tailored for scenes, which are\nprocedurally constructed, based on a given set of building rules. Rendering of\nlarge scenes normally requires the entire scene available in-core, or\nalternatively, it requires out-of-core management to load data into the memory\nhierarchy as a part of the rendering loop. Instead of out-of-core memory\nmanagement, we propose to procedurally generate the scene on-demand on the fly.\nThe key idea is a positional- and view-dependent procedural scene-construction\nstrategy, where only a fraction of the atomistic scene around the camera is\navailable in the GPU memory at any given time. The atomistic detail is\npopulated into a uniform-space partitioning using a grid that covers the entire\nscene. Most of the grid cells are not filled with geometry, only those are\npopulated that are potentially seen by the camera. The atomistic detail is\npopulated in a compute shader and its representation is connected with\nacceleration data structures for hardware ray-tracing of modern GPUs. Objects\nwhich are far away, where atomistic detail is not perceivable from a given\nviewpoint, are represented by a triangle mesh mapped with a seamless texture,\ngenerated from the rendering of geometry from atomistic detail. The algorithm\nconsists of two pipelines, the construction computes pipeline and the rendering\npipeline, which work together to render molecular scenes at an atomistic\nresolution far beyond the limit of the GPU memory containing trillions of\natoms.

    "abstract": "The challenge to establish and verify human identity over the Internet in a\nsecure and privacy-respecting way is long-standing. In this paper, we explore\nthe blockchain trilemma of scalability, security, and decentralization in the\ncontext of the Trust Registry: a root of trust for a decentralized identity\nscheme that enables read and write access to shared records and is\ntamper-resistant. We make a case study of Hyperledger Indy -- an open-source\ntechnology bespoke for decentralized identity -- and conduct two empirical\nexperiments to measure the latency of more than 45,000 transactions in the\nnaturalistic environment of Amazon Web Services. We conclude that issues of\nTrust Registry scalability have multiple facets. While Hyperledger Indy\ncaptures data useful to underpin a decentralized identity scheme, the knock-on\neffect of its scalability limitations may indeed place constraints on\nproperties of security and decentralization. The current credential\nverification process relies on transaction processing by a ledger with\ntransaction processing bottlenecks, which may constrain the ideal of\nnon-repudiation.",

    "title": "Surrogate Ensemble Forecasting for Dynamic Climate Impact Models",
    "abstract": "As acute climate change impacts weather and climate variability, there is\nincreased demand for robust climate impact model predictions from which\nforecasts of the impacts can be derived. The quality of those predictions are\nlimited by the climate drivers for the impact models which are nonlinear and\nhighly variable in nature. One way to estimate the uncertainty of the model\ndrivers is to assess the distribution of ensembles of climate forecasts. To\ncapture the uncertainty in the impact model outputs associated with the\ndistribution of the input climate forecasts, each individual forecast ensemble\nmember has to be propagated through the physical model which can imply high\ncomputational costs. It is therefore desirable to train a surrogate model which\nallows predictions of the uncertainties of the output distribution in ensembles\nof climate drivers, thus reducing resource demands. This study considers a\nclimate driven disease model, the Liverpool Malaria Model (LMM), which predicts\nthe malaria transmission coefficient R0. Seasonal ensembles forecasts of\ntemperature and precipitation with a 6-month horizon are propagated through the\nmodel, predicting the distribution of transmission time series. The input and\noutput data is used to train surrogate models in the form of a Random Forest\nQuantile Regression (RFQR) model and a Bayesian Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM)\nneural network. Comparing the predictive performance, the RFQR better predicts\nthe time series of the individual ensemble member, while the BLSTM offers a\ndirect way to construct a combined distribution for all ensemble members. An\nimportant element of the proposed methodology is that accounting for non-normal\ndistributions of climate forecast ensembles can be captured naturally by a\nBayesian formulation.",

    "title": "Multi-View Breast Cancer Classification via Hypercomplex Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Traditionally, deep learning-based methods for breast cancer classification\nperform a single-view analysis. However, radiologists simultaneously analyze\nall four views that compose a mammography exam, owing to the correlations\ncontained in mammography views, which present crucial information for\nidentifying tumors. In light of this, some studies have started to propose\nmulti-view methods. Nevertheless, in such existing architectures, mammogram\nviews are processed as independent images by separate convolutional branches,\nthus losing correlations among them. To overcome such limitations, in this\npaper we propose a novel approach for multi-view breast cancer classification\nbased on parameterized hypercomplex neural networks. Thanks to hypercomplex\nalgebra properties, our networks are able to model, and thus leverage, existing\ncorrelations between the different views that comprise a mammogram exam, thus\nmimicking the reading process performed by clinicians. As a consequence, the\nproposed method is able to handle the information of a patient altogether\nwithout breaking the multi-view nature of the exam. Starting from the proposed\nhypercomplex approach, we define architectures designed to process two-view\nexams, namely PHResNets, and four-view exams, i.e., PHYSEnet and PHYSBOnet,\nwith the ability to grasp inter-view correlations in a wide range of clinical\nuse cases. Through an extensive experimental evaluation conducted with two\npublicly available datasets, CBIS-DDSM and INbreast, we demonstrate that our\nparameterized hypercomplex models clearly outperform real-valued counterparts\nand also state-of-the-art methods, proving that breast cancer classification\nbenefits from the proposed multi-view architecture.

    "abstract": "Accuracy of English-language Question Answering (QA) systems has improved\nsignificantly in recent years with the advent of Transformer-based models\n(e.g., BERT). These models are pre-trained in a self-supervised fashion with a\nlarge English text corpus and further fine-tuned with a massive English QA\ndataset (e.g., SQuAD). However, QA datasets on such a scale are not available\nfor most of the other languages. Multi-lingual BERT-based models (mBERT) are\noften used to transfer knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource\nlanguages. Since these models are pre-trained with huge text corpora containing\nmultiple languages, they typically learn language-agnostic embeddings for\ntokens from different languages. However, directly training an mBERT-based QA\nsystem for low-resource languages is challenging due to the paucity of training\ndata. In this work, we augment the QA samples of the target language using\ntranslation and transliteration into other languages and use the augmented data\nto fine-tune an mBERT-based QA model, which is already pre-trained in English.\nExperiments on the Google ChAII dataset show that fine-tuning the mBERT model\nwith translations from the same language family boosts the question-answering\nperformance, whereas the performance degrades in the case of cross-language\nfamilies. We further show that introducing a contrastive loss between the\ntranslated question-context feature pairs during the fine-tuning process,\nprevents such degradation with cross-lingual family translations and leads to\nmarginal improvement.

In this paper, we aim to build an\nentity recognition model requiring only a few shots of annotated document\nimages. To overcome the data limitation, we propose to leverage the label\nsurface names to better inform the model of the target entity type semantics\nand also embed the labels into the spatial embedding space to capture the\nspatial correspondence between regions and labels. Specifically, we go beyond\nsequence labeling and develop a novel label-aware seq2seq framework, LASER. The\nproposed model follows a new labeling scheme that generates the label surface\nnames word-by-word explicitly after generating the entities. During training,\nLASER refines the label semantics by updating the label surface name\nrepresentations and also strengthens the label-region correlation. In this way,\nLASER recognizes the entities from document images through both semantic and\nlayout correspondence. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of LASER under the few-shot setting.",

However, these methods fail to\nsufficiently leverage the relationship between spectral bands in HSI data.

Then, by integrating attention\nmechanism into information aggregation of graph, the GCAFM, including three\nparts, i.e., spatial graph attention block, spectral graph attention block, and\nfusion block, is designed to fuse the spatial and spectral features and\nsuppress noise interference in Sa-GCN and Se-GCN.

We train models with over 5 billion parameters\nfor more than 170 billion tokens, thereby increasing the likelihood that our\nconclusions will transfer to even larger scales. Our experiments show that\ncausal decoder-only models trained on an autoregressive language modeling\nobjective exhibit the strongest zero-shot generalization after purely\nunsupervised pretraining. However, models with non-causal visibility on their\ninput trained with a masked language modeling objective followed by multitask\nfinetuning perform the best among our experiments. We therefore consider the\nadaptation of pretrained models across architectures and objectives. We find\nthat pretrained non-causal decoder models can be adapted into performant\ngenerative causal decoder models, using autoregressive language modeling as a\ndownstream task. Furthermore, we find that pretrained causal decoder models can\nbe efficiently adapted into non-causal decoder models, ultimately achieving\ncompetitive performance after multitask finetuning.

One of the most effective strategies to\ncontrol catastrophic forgetting, the Achilles' heel of continual learning, is\nstoring part of the old data and replaying them interleaved with new\nexperiences (also known as the replay approach).

To learn an informative embedding\nthat can flexibly encode the semantics of various queries, we propose a novel\nmultimodal probabilistic composer (MPC). Specifically, we model input images\nand texts as probabilistic embeddings, which can be further composed by a\nprobabilistic composition rule to facilitate image retrieval with multiple\nmultimodal queries. We propose a new benchmark based on the MS-COCO dataset and\nevaluate our model on various setups that compose multiple images and (or) text\nqueries for multimodal image retrieval.

More recently,\ncomputational tools from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature have\nbeen proposed for measuring such disparity using relatively extensive datasets\nand empirically rigorous methodologies. In this paper, we contribute to this\nline of research by studying gender disparity, at scale, in copyright-expired\nliterary texts published in the pre-modern period (defined in this work as the\nperiod ranging from the mid-nineteenth through the mid-twentieth century). One\nof the challenges in using such tools is to ensure quality control, and by\nextension, trustworthy statistical analysis. Another challenge is in using\nmaterials and methods that are publicly available and have been established for\nsome time, both to ensure that they can be used and vetted in the future, and\nalso, to add confidence to the methodology itself. We present our solution to\naddressing these challenges, and using multiple measures, demonstrate the\nsignificant discrepancy between the prevalence of female characters and male\ncharacters in pre-modern literature. The evidence suggests that the discrepancy\ndeclines when the author is female. The discrepancy seems to be relatively\nstable as we plot data over the decades in this century-long period.

    "abstract": "Graph Representation Learning (GRL) has become central for characterizing\nstructures of complex networks and performing tasks such as link prediction,\nnode classification, network reconstruction, and community detection. Whereas\nnumerous generative GRL models have been proposed, many approaches have\nprohibitive computational requirements hampering large-scale network analysis,\nfewer are able to explicitly account for structure emerging at multiple scales,\nand only a few explicitly respect important network properties such as\nhomophily and transitivity. This paper proposes a novel scalable graph\nrepresentation learning method named the Hierarchical Block Distance Model\n(HBDM). The HBDM imposes a multiscale block structure akin to stochastic block\nmodeling (SBM) and accounts for homophily and transitivity by accurately\napproximating the latent distance model (LDM) throughout the inferred\nhierarchy. The HBDM naturally accommodates unipartite, directed, and bipartite\nnetworks whereas the hierarchy is designed to ensure linearithmic time and\nspace complexity enabling the analysis of very large-scale networks. We\nevaluate the performance of the HBDM on massive networks consisting of millions\nof nodes. Importantly, we find that the proposed HBDM framework significantly\noutperforms recent scalable approaches in all considered downstream tasks.\nSurprisingly, we observe superior performance even imposing ultra-low\ntwo-dimensional embeddings facilitating accurate direct and hierarchical-aware\nnetwork visualization and interpretation.",

We\nremove this constraint by presenting a purely data-driven framework for\nmodelling probabilistic drift in flexible environments. We train a CNN to\npredict the temporal evolution of probability density maps of particle\nlocations from $t$ to $t+1$ given an input velocity field. We generate\ngroundtruth density maps on the basis of ocean circulation model simulations by\nsimulating uncertainty in the initial position of particle trajectories.\nSeveral loss functions for regressing the predicted density maps are tested.\nThrough evaluating our model on unseen velocities from a different year, we\nfind its outputs to be in good agreement with numerical simulations, suggesting\nsatisfactory generalisation to different dynamical situations.",

    "abstract": "Robots will experience non-stationary environment dynamics throughout their\nlifetime: the robot dynamics can change due to wear and tear, or its\nsurroundings may change over time. Eventually, the robots should perform well\nin all of the environment variations it has encountered. At the same time, it\nshould still be able to learn fast in a new environment. We investigate two\nchallenges in such a lifelong learning setting: first, existing off-policy\nalgorithms struggle with the trade-off between being conservative to maintain\ngood performance in the old environment and learning efficiently in the new\nenvironment. We propose the Offline Distillation Pipeline to break this\ntrade-off by separating the training procedure into interleaved phases of\nonline interaction and offline distillation. Second, training with the combined\ndatasets from multiple environments across the lifetime might create a\nsignificant performance drop compared to training on the datasets individually.\nOur hypothesis is that both the imbalanced quality and size of the datasets\nexacerbate the extrapolation error of the Q-function during offline training\nover the \"weaker\" dataset. We propose a simple fix to the issue by keeping the\npolicy closer to the dataset during the distillation phase. In the experiments,\nwe demonstrate these challenges and the proposed solutions with a simulated\nbipedal robot walking task across various environment changes. We show that the\nOffline Distillation Pipeline achieves better performance across all the\nencountered environments without affecting data collection. We also provide a\ncomprehensive empirical study to support our hypothesis on the data imbalance\nissue.",

Identifying relevant and trending\nsocietal matters is important, and often done using social network analysis for\ntraditional social media channels such as twitter. In this paper we explore\nwhether this type of analysis can also be used for introspection of the\nsoftware world, by looking at the thriving scene of young Scratch programmers.\nThe educational programming language Scratch is not only used for teaching\nprogramming concepts, but offers a platform for young programmers to express\nand share their creativity on any topics of relevance. By analyzing titles and\nproject comments in a dataset of 106.032 Scratch projects, we explore which\ntopics are common in the Scratch community, whether socially relevant events\nare reflected and how how the sentiment in the comments is. It turns out that\nthe diversity of topics within the Scratch projects make the analysis process\nchallenging. Our results nevertheless show that topics from pop and net culture\nin particular are present, and even recent societal events such as the Covid-19\npandemic or BLM are to some extent reflected in Scratch. The tone in the\ncomments is mostly positive with catchy youth language. Hence, despite the\nchallenges, Scratch projects can be studied in the same way as social networks,\nwhich opens up new possibilities to improve our understanding of the behavior\nand motivation of novice programmers.",

However, it is difficult to directly apply the supervised model to\narbitrary unseen domains due to the domain gap between the available source\ndomains and unseen target domains. In this paper, we propose a novel label\ndistribution learning (LDL) method to address the generalizable multi-source\nperson Re-ID task (i.e., there are multiple available source domains, and the\ntesting domain is unseen during training), which aims to explore the relation\nof different classes and mitigate the domain-shift across different domains so\nas to improve the discrimination of the model and learn the domain-invariant\nfeature, simultaneously. Specifically, during the training process, we produce\nthe label distribution via the online manner to mine the relation information\nof different classes, thus it is beneficial for extracting the discriminative\nfeature. Besides, for the label distribution of each class, we further revise\nit to give more and equal attention to the other domains that the class does\nnot belong to, which can effectively reduce the domain gap across different\ndomains and obtain the domain-invariant feature. Furthermore, we also give the\ntheoretical analysis to demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively\ndeal with the domain-shift issue.

Our key\ninsight is that there exist transferable distribution characteristics among\ndifferent forgery approaches with the majority and minority classes.\nSpecifically, we enhance the discriminative ability against novel forgery\napproaches via adversarially interpolating the artifacts of the minority\nsamples to the majority samples under the guidance of a teacher network.

Hence, we are\nunable to answer questions like: Do loyal users enjoy better recommendations\nthan non-loyal users? Loyalty can be defined by the time period a user has been\nactive in a recommender system, or by the number of historical interactions a\nuser has. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive analysis of recommendation\nresults along global timeline. We conduct experiments with five widely used\nmodels, i.e., BPR, NeuMF, LightGCN, SASRec and TiSASRec, on four benchmark\ndatasets, i.e., MovieLens-25M, Yelp, Amazon-music, and Amazon-electronic. Our\nexperiment results give an answer \"No\" to the above question. Users with many\nhistorical interactions suffer from relatively poorer recommendations. Users\nwho stay with the system for a short time period enjoy better recommendations.\nBoth findings are counter-intuitive. Interestingly, users who have recently\ninteracted with the system, with respect to the time point of the test\ninstance, enjoy better recommendations.

As dialogue can potentially\nspan infinitely many topics and tasks, a task-oriented dialogue system must\nhave the capability to continually learn, dynamically adapting to new\nchallenges while preserving the knowledge it already acquired. Despite the\nimportance, continual reinforcement learning of the dialogue policy has\nremained largely unaddressed. The lack of a framework with training protocols,\nbaseline models and suitable metrics, has so far hindered research in this\ndirection. In this work we fill precisely this gap, enabling research in\ndialogue policy optimisation to go from static to dynamic learning. We provide\na continual learning algorithm, baseline architectures and metrics for\nassessing continual learning models.

Unfortunately, there are many cases where developers do not\nrespect the semantic versioning policy, leading to the breakage of dependent\napplications. To reduce such cases, we proposed using machine learning (ML)\ntechniques to effectively predict the new release type, i.e., patch, minor,\nmajor, in order to properly determine the semantic versioning type. To perform\nour prediction, we mined and used a number of features about a release, such as\nthe complexity of the changed code, change types, and development activities.\nWe then used four ML classifiers. To evaluate the performance of the proposed\nML classifiers, we conducted an empirical study on 31 JavaScript packages\ncontaining a total of approximately 6,260 releases. We started by extracting 41\nrelease level features from historical data of packages' source code and\nrepositories. Then, we used four machine learning classifiers, namely XGBoost,\nRandom Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. We found that the\nXGBoost classifiers performed the best, achieving median ROC AUC values of\n0.78, 0.69, and 0.74 for major, minor, and patch releases, respectively. We\nalso found that features related to the change types in a release are the best\npredictors group of features in determining the semantic versioning type.\nFinally, we studied the generalizability of determining the semantic versioning\ntype by applying cross-package validation. Our results showed that the general\nclassifier achieved median ROC AUC values of 0.76, 0.69, and 0.75 for major,\nminor, and patch releases.",

    "abstract": "Ultra-high data rates with low-power consumption wireless communications and\nlow-complexity receivers is one of the key requirements for the next 6-th\nGeneration (6G) of communication networks. Sub-Terahertz (SubTHz) frequency\nbands can support Ultra-WideBand (UWB) communications and can thus offer\nunprecedented increase in the wireless network capacity, rendering those bands\nand relevant research a strong candidate technology for 6G. However, in\ncontrast to millimeter-wave communications, the technological advances in\nsubTHz transceivers are not yet completely mature. In this paper, we focus on\nthe Time Reversal (TR) precoding scheme, which is a computationally simple and\nrobust technique capable of focusing UWB waveforms on both time and space, by\nexploiting channel diversity when available. We design a novel experimental\nsetup, including a THz link inside a waveguide and operating at the carrier\nfrequency 273.6 GHz with 2 GHz transmission bandwidth, and deploy it to perform\nmulti-user communications with simple modulation. Our results demonstrate large\ncommunication rates with only 3 mm space separation of the receiving antennas.",

    "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to find efficient models for multiple\ntasks. Beyond seeking solutions for a single task, there are surging interests\nin transferring network design knowledge across multiple tasks. In this line of\nresearch, effectively modeling task correlations is vital yet highly neglected.\nTherefore, we propose \\textbf{Arch-Graph}, a transferable NAS method that\npredicts task-specific optimal architectures with respect to given task\nembeddings. It leverages correlations across multiple tasks by using their\nembeddings as a part of the predictor's input for fast adaptation. We also\nformulate NAS as an architecture relation graph prediction problem, with the\nrelational graph constructed by treating candidate architectures as nodes and\ntheir pairwise relations as edges. To enforce some basic properties such as\nacyclicity in the relational graph, we add additional constraints to the\noptimization process, converting NAS into the problem of finding a Maximal\nWeighted Acyclic Subgraph (MWAS). Our algorithm then strives to eliminate\ncycles and only establish edges in the graph if the rank results can be\ntrusted. Through MWAS, Arch-Graph can effectively rank candidate models for\neach task with only a small budget to finetune the predictor. With extensive\nexperiments on TransNAS-Bench-101, we show Arch-Graph's transferability and\nhigh sample efficiency across numerous tasks, beating many NAS methods designed\nfor both single-task and multi-task search. It is able to find top 0.16\\% and\n0.29\\% architectures on average on two search spaces under the budget of only\n50 models.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an automatic image co-segmentation algorithm based on\ndeep reinforcement learning (RL). Existing co-segmentation tasks mainly rely on\ndeep learning methods, and the obtained foreground edges are often rough. In\norder to obtain more precise foreground edges, we use deep RL to solve this\nproblem and achieve the finer segmentation. To our best knowledge, this is the\nfirst work to apply RL methods to co-segmentation. We define the problem as a\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP) and optimize it by RL with asynchronous advantage\nactor-critic (A3C). The RL image co-segmentation network uses the correlation\nbetween images to segment common and salient objects from a set of related\nimages. In order to achieve automatic segmentation, our RL-CoSeg method\neliminates user's hints. For the image co-segmentation problem, we propose a\ncollaborative RL algorithm based on the A3C model. We propose a Siamese RL\nco-segmentation network structure to obtain the co-attention of images for\nco-segmentation. We improve the self-attention for automatic RL algorithm to\nobtain long-distance dependence and enlarge the receptive field. The image\nfeature information obtained by self-attention can be used to supplement the\ndeleted user's hints and help to obtain more accurate actions.

    "abstract": "Across a plethora of social situations, we touch others in natural and\nintuitive ways to share thoughts and emotions, such as tapping to get one's\nattention or caressing to soothe one's anxiety. A deeper understanding of these\nhuman-to-human interactions will require, in part, the precise measurement of\nskin-to-skin physical contact. Among prior efforts, each measurement approach\nexhibits certain constraints, e.g., motion trackers do not capture the precise\nshape of skin surfaces, while pressure sensors impede direct skin contact. In\ncontrast, this work develops an interference-free 3D visual tracking system\nusing a depth camera to measure the contact attributes between the bare hand of\na toucher and the forearm of a receiver. The toucher's hand is tracked as a\nposed and positioned mesh by fitting a hand model to detected 3D joints,\nwhereas the forearm is extracted as a detailed 3D surface. Based on a contact\nmodel of point clouds, the spatiotemporal contact changes are decomposed as six\nhigh-resolution time-series attributes, i.e., contact area, indentation depth,\nabsolute velocity, and three orthogonal velocity components, together with\ncontact duration. To examine the system's capabilities and limitations, two\nexperiments were performed. First, to evaluate its ability to discern human\ntouches, one person delivered cued social messages, e.g., happiness, anger,\nsympathy, to another using their preferred gestures. The results indicated that\nmessages, gestures, and the individual touchers, were readily discerned from\ntheir contact attributes. Second, the measurement accuracy was validated\nagainst independent devices, including an electromagnetic tracker, pressure\nmat, and laser sensor. While validated here in the context of social\ncommunication, this system is extendable to human touch interactions such as\nmaternal care of infants and massage therapy.",

    "abstract": "Previous knowledge distillation (KD) methods for object detection mostly\nfocus on feature imitation instead of mimicking the classification logits due\nto its inefficiency in distilling the localization information. In this paper,\nwe investigate whether logit mimicking always lags behind feature imitation.\nTowards this goal, we first present a novel localization distillation (LD)\nmethod which can efficiently transfer the localization knowledge from the\nteacher to the student. Second, we introduce the concept of valuable\nlocalization region that can aid to selectively distill the classification and\nlocalization knowledge for a certain region. Combining these two new\ncomponents, for the first time, we show that logit mimicking can outperform\nfeature imitation and the absence of localization distillation is a critical\nreason for why logit mimicking underperforms for years. The thorough studies\nexhibit the great potential of logit mimicking that can significantly alleviate\nthe localization ambiguity, learn robust feature representation, and ease the\ntraining difficulty in the early stage. We also provide the theoretical\nconnection between the proposed LD and the classification KD, that they share\nthe equivalent optimization effect. Our distillation scheme is simple as well\nas effective and can be easily applied to both dense horizontal object\ndetectors and rotated object detectors. Extensive experiments on the MS COCO,\nPASCAL VOC, and DOTA benchmarks demonstrate that our method can achieve\nconsiderable AP improvement without any sacrifice on the inference speed.

    "abstract": "Fixing bugs in a timely manner lowers various potential costs in software\nmaintenance. However, manual bug fixing scheduling can be time-consuming,\ncumbersome, and error-prone. In this paper, we propose the Schedule and\nDependency-aware Bug Triage (S-DABT), a bug triaging method that utilizes\ninteger programming and machine learning techniques to assign bugs to suitable\ndevelopers. Unlike prior works that largely focus on a single component of the\nbug reports, our approach takes into account the textual data, bug fixing\ncosts, and bug dependencies. We further incorporate the schedule of developers\nin our formulation to have a more comprehensive model for this multifaceted\nproblem. As a result, this complete formulation considers developers' schedules\nand the blocking effects of the bugs while covering the most significant\naspects of the previously proposed methods. Our numerical study on four\nopen-source software systems, namely, EclipseJDT, LibreOffice, GCC, and\nMozilla, shows that taking into account the schedules of the developers\ndecreases the average bug fixing times. We find that S-DABT leads to a high\nlevel of developer utilization through a fair distribution of the tasks among\nthe developers and efficient use of the free spots in their schedules. Via the\nsimulation of the issue tracking system, we also show how incorporating the\nschedule in the model formulation reduces the bug fixing time, improves the\nassignment accuracy, and utilizes the capability of each developer without much\ncomprising in the model run times. We find that S-DABT decreases the complexity\nof the bug dependency graph by prioritizing blocking bugs and effectively\nreduces the infeasible assignment ratio due to bug dependencies. Consequently,\nwe recommend considering developers' schedules while automating bug triage.",

    "abstract": "This paper reveals about global navigation satellite system GNSS in the\nindian subcontinent known as the navigation in the indian subcontinent(NavIC)\nWe have tried to model a new technique in GNSS known as the optical flow\ntracking global navigation system (OF GNSS). This method using differential\nequations is very accurate for very small distances on the surface of the earth\nin the 1500km range of the Indian subcontinent satellite coverage. When we talk\nof accuracy of the GPS system it should be very accurate on the surface of the\nearth when used to show changes in coordinate of the moving body with respect\nto the ground by the satellite which is situated on the earths orbit. Optical\nflow is a method which uses movements with respect to x and y axis for\ninfinitesimal changes in its coordinates and then uses this algorithm to use it\nin global positioning system to find accurate position of the body with respect\nto the satellite coordinates with respect to ground positioning. The modern\nmethod of differential frames is also very accurate as it involves\ninfinitesimal frames which are modelled together from the satellite to find\nchanges in the coordinates on the earths surface, so we have designed a new\nalgorithm in this paper on the Optical flow GNSS system which is an alternative\nand can improve the study done in the design of these algorithms in this field\nof applications.",

    "abstract": "Safe memory reclamation (SMR) schemes are an essential tool for lock-free\ndata structures and concurrent programming. However, manual SMR schemes are\nnotoriously difficult to apply correctly, and automatic schemes, such as\nreference counting, have been argued for over a decade to be too slow for\npractical purposes. A recent wave of work has disproved this long-held notion\nand shown that reference counting can be as scalable as hazard pointers, one of\nthe most common manual techniques. Despite these tremendous improvements, there\nremains a gap of up to 2x or more in performance between these schemes and\nfaster manual techniques such as epoch-based reclamation (EBR).\nIn this work, we first advance these ideas and show that in many cases,\nautomatic reference counting can in fact be as fast as the fastest manual SMR\ntechniques. We generalize our previous Concurrent Deferred Reference Counting\n(CDRC) algorithm to obtain a method for converting any standard manual SMR\ntechnique into an automatic reference counting technique with a similar\nperformance profile. Our second contribution is extending this framework to\nsupport weak pointers, which are reference-counted pointers that automatically\nbreak pointer cycles by not contributing to the reference count, thus\naddressing a common weakness in reference-counted garbage collection.\nOur experiments with a C++-library implementation show that our automatic\ntechniques perform in line with their manual counterparts, and that our weak\npointer implementation outperforms the best known atomic weak pointer library\nby up to an order of magnitude on high thread counts. All together, we show\nthat the ease of use of automatic memory management can be achieved without\nsignificant cost to practical performance or general applicability.",

    "abstract": "High-dimensional transport equations frequently occur in science and\nengineering. Computing their numerical solution, however, is challenging due to\nits high dimensionality.\nIn this work we develop an algorithm to efficiently solve the transport\nequation in moderately complex geometrical domains using a Galerkin method\nstabilized by streamline diffusion. The ansatz spaces are a tensor product of a\nsparse grid in space and discontinuous piecewise polynomials in time. Here, the\nsparse grid is constructed upon nested multilevel finite element spaces to\nprovide geometric flexibility. This results in an implicit time-stepping scheme\nwhich we prove to be stable and convergent. If the solution has additional\nmixed regularity, the convergence of a $2d$-dimensional problem equals that of\na $d$-dimensional one up to logarithmic factors.\nFor the implementation, we rely on the sparse grid combination technique,\nwhich enables us to store the functions and to carry out the computations on a\nsequence of anisotropic full grids exploiting the tensor product structure of\nthe ansatz spaces. In this way existing finite element libraries and GPU\nacceleration can be used. The combination technique is also used as a\npreconditioner for an iterative scheme to solve the transport equation on the\nsequence of time strips.\nNumerical tests show that the method works well for problems in up to six\ndimensions.

Here we combine employment,\npublication, and federal survey data for 78,802 tenure-track faculty at 262\nPhD-granting institutions in the American university system between 2008--2017\nto show through multiple lines of evidence that the greater availability of\nfunded graduate and postdoctoral labor at more prestigious institutions drives\nthe environmental effect of prestige on productivity. In particular, we show\nthat greater environmental prestige leads to larger faculty-led research\ngroups, which drive higher faculty productivity, primarily in disciplines with\nresearch group collaboration norms. In contrast, we show that productivity does\nnot increase substantially with prestige for either faculty papers published\nwithout group members, nor group members themselves.

Our\nproposed novelties address two weaknesses in the literature. First, a recent\nmethod proposes to learn mention detection and then entity candidate selection,\nbut relies on predefined sets of candidates. We use encoder-decoder\nautoregressive entity linking in order to bypass this need, and propose to\ntrain mention detection as an auxiliary task instead. Second, previous work\nsuggests that re-ranking could help correct prediction errors. We add a new,\nauxiliary task, match prediction, to learn re-ranking. Without the use of a\nknowledge base or candidate sets, our model sets a new state of the art in two\nbenchmark datasets of entity linking: COMETA in the biomedical domain, and\nAIDA-CoNLL in the news domain. We show through ablation studies that each of\nthe two auxiliary tasks increases performance, and that re-ranking is an\nimportant factor to the increase. Finally, our low-resource experimental\nresults suggest that performance on the main task benefits from the knowledge\nlearned by the auxiliary tasks, and not just from the additional training data.",

While large-scale pre-trained models\nare useful for image classification across domains, it remains unclear if they\ncan be applied in a zero-shot manner to more complex tasks like ReC. We present\nReCLIP, a simple but strong zero-shot baseline that repurposes CLIP, a\nstate-of-the-art large-scale model, for ReC. Motivated by the close connection\nbetween ReC and CLIP's contrastive pre-training objective, the first component\nof ReCLIP is a region-scoring method that isolates object proposals via\ncropping and blurring, and passes them to CLIP. However, through controlled\nexperiments on a synthetic dataset, we find that CLIP is largely incapable of\nperforming spatial reasoning off-the-shelf. Thus, the second component of\nReCLIP is a spatial relation resolver that handles several types of spatial\nrelations. We reduce the gap between zero-shot baselines from prior work and\nsupervised models by as much as 29% on RefCOCOg, and on RefGTA (video game\nimagery), ReCLIP's relative improvement over supervised ReC models trained on\nreal images is 8%.",

    "abstract": "Large-amplitude chatter vibrations are one of the most important phenomena in\nmachining processes. It is often detrimental in cutting operations causing a\npoor surface finish and decreased tool life. Therefore, chatter detection using\nmachine learning has been an active research area over the last decade. Three\nchallenges can be identified in applying machine learning for chatter detection\nat large in industry: an insufficient understanding of the universality of\nchatter features across different processes, the need for automating feature\nextraction, and the existence of limited data for each specific\nworkpiece-machine tool combination. These three challenges can be grouped under\nthe umbrella of transfer learning. This paper studies automating chatter\ndetection by evaluating transfer learning of prominent as well as novel chatter\ndetection methods. We investigate chatter classification accuracy using a\nvariety of features extracted from turning and milling experiments with\ndifferent cutting configurations. The studied methods include Fast Fourier\nTransform (FFT), Power Spectral Density (PSD), the Auto-correlation Function\n(ACF), Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT), and Ensemble Empirical Mode\nDecomposition (EEMD). We also examine more recent approaches based on\nTopological Data Analysis (TDA) and similarity measures of time series based on\nDiscrete Time Warping (DTW). We evaluate the transfer learning potential of\neach approach by training and testing both within and across the turning and\nmilling data sets. Our results show that carefully chosen time-frequency\nfeatures can lead to high classification accuracies albeit at the cost of\nrequiring manual pre-processing and the tagging of an expert user. On the other\nhand, we found that the TDA and DTW approaches can provide accuracies and F1\nscores on par with the time-frequency methods without the need for manual\npreprocessing.",

The proposed\nentropy-regularized NPG method enables each agent to deploy symmetric,\ndecentralized, and multiplicative updates according to its own payoff. We show\nthat the proposed method converges to the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) --\nthe equilibrium to the entropy-regularized game -- at a sublinear rate, which\nis independent of the size of the action space and grows at most sublinearly\nwith the number of agents.

We demonstrate, in a real-world dataset with over 950 sessions of\npsychotherapy treatments in anxiety, depression, schizophrenia and suicidal\npatients, the effectiveness of this method in mapping out trajectories of\npatient-therapist alignment and the interpretability that can offer insights in\nclinical psychiatry. We believe such a framework can be provide timely feedback\nto the therapist regarding the quality of the conversation in interview\nsessions.",

However,\nrecording large spatial areas with nano-FTIR is limited by long measurement\ntimes due to its sequential data acquisition.

All of them have in common that only\na small fraction of randomly chosen measurements is required.\nHowever, choosing the fraction of measurements in a random fashion poses\npractical challenges for scanning procedures and does not lead to time savings\nas large as desired. We consider different, practically relevant sub-sampling\nschemes assuring a faster acquisition. It is demonstrated that results for\nalmost all considered sub-sampling schemes, namely original Lissajous, triangle\nLissajous, and random reflection sub-sampling, at a sub-sampling rate of 10%,\nare comparable to results when using a random sub-sampling of 10%.

This controller can tune its degree of\ndecentralization using the parameter $\\kappa$ and thus allows a\ncharacterization of the relationship between decentralization and performance.\nWe show that under mild assumptions, including stabilizability, detectability,\nand a polynomially growing graph condition, the performance difference between\n$\\kappa$-distributed control and centralized optimal control becomes\nexponentially small in $\\kappa$.

    "abstract": "Underwater ocean acoustics is a complex physical phenomenon involving not\nonly widely varying physical parameters and dynamical scales but also\nuncertainties in the ocean parameters. Thus, it is difficult to construct\ngeneralized physical models which can work in a broad range of situations. In\nthis regard, we propose a convolutional recurrent autoencoder network (CRAN)\narchitecture, which is a data-driven deep learning model for acoustic\npropagation. Being data-driven it is independent of how the data is obtained\nand can be employed for learning various ocean acoustic phenomena. The CRAN\nmodel can learn a reduced-dimensional representation of physical data and can\npredict the system evolution efficiently. Two cases of increasing complexity\nare considered to demonstrate the generalization ability of the CRAN. The first\ncase is a one-dimensional wave propagation with spatially-varying discontinuous\ninitial conditions. The second case corresponds to a far-field transmission\nloss distribution in a two-dimensional ocean domain with depth-dependent\nsources. For both cases, the CRAN can learn the essential elements of wave\npropagation physics such as characteristic patterns while predicting long-time\nsystem evolution with satisfactory accuracy. Such ability of the CRAN to learn\ncomplex ocean acoustics phenomena has the potential of real-time prediction for\nmarine vessel decision-making and online control.",

Usual frequency domain approaches have higher latency and complexity.\nHence we introduce a novel probabilistic optimization method which we call\n\"Random Directions\", which can overcome local minima, applied to a simple time\ndomain unmixing structure, and which is scalable for low complexity.

    "abstract": "Partial shapes correspondences is a problem that often occurs in computer\nvision (occlusion, evolution in time...). In medical imaging, data may come\nfrom different modalities and be acquired under different conditions which\nleads to variations in shapes and topologies. In this paper we use an\nasymmetric data dissimilarity term applicable to various geometric shapes like\nsets of curves or surfaces, assessing the embedding of a shape into another one\nwithout relying on correspondences. It is designed as a data attachment for the\nLarge Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework, allowing to\ncompute a meaningful deformation of one shape onto a subset of the other. We\nrefine it in order to control the resulting non-rigid deformations and provide\nconsistent deformations of the shapes along with their ambient space. We show\nthat partial matching can be used for robust multi-modal liver registration\nbetween a Computed Tomography (CT) volume and a Cone Beam Computed Tomography\n(CBCT) volume. The 3D imaging of the patient CBCT at point of care that we call\nlive is truncated while the CT pre-intervention provides a full visualization\nof the liver. The proposed method allows the truncated surfaces from CBCT to be\naligned non-rigidly, yet realistically, with surfaces from CT with an average\ndistance of 2.6mm(+/- 2.2). The generated deformations extend consistently to\nthe liver volume, and are evaluated on points of interest for the physicians,\nwith an average distance of 5.8mm (+/- 2.7) for vessels bifurcations and 5.13mm\n(+/- 2.5) for tumors landmarks. Such multi-modality volumes registrations would\nhelp the physicians in the perspective of navigating their tools in the\npatient's anatomy to locate structures that are hardly visible in the CBCT used\nduring their procedures.

    "abstract": "In recent decades, climate change has significantly affected glacier\ndynamics, resulting in mass loss and an increased risk of glacier-related\nhazards including supraglacial and proglacial lake development, as well as\ncatastrophic outburst flooding. Rapidly changing conditions dictate the need\nfor continuous and detailed observations and analysis of climate-glacier\ndynamics. Thematic and quantitative information regarding glacier geometry is\nfundamental for understanding climate forcing and the sensitivity of glaciers\nto climate change, however, accurately mapping debris-cover glaciers (DCGs) is\nnotoriously difficult based upon the use of spectral information and\nconventional machine-learning techniques. The objective of this research is to\nimprove upon an earlier proposed deep-learning-based approach, GlacierNet,\nwhich was developed to exploit a convolutional neural-network segmentation\nmodel to accurately outline regional DCG ablation zones. Specifically, we\ndeveloped an enhanced GlacierNet2 architecture thatincorporates multiple\nmodels, automatic post-processing, and basin-level hydrological flow techniques\nto improve the mapping of DCGs such that it includes both the ablation and\naccumulation zones. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GlacierNet2\nimproves the estimation of the ablation zone and allows a high level of\nintersection over union (IOU: 0.8839) score. The proposed architecture provides\ncomplete glacier (both accumulation and ablation zone) outlines at regional\nscales, with an overall IOU score of 0.8619. This is a crucial first step in\nautomating complete glacier mapping that can be used for accurate glacier\nmodeling or mass-balance analysis.",

However, speech signals can be degraded by several\ndifferent distortions simultaneously in the real world. It is thus important to\nextend speech restoration models to deal with multiple distortions. In this\npaper, we introduce VoiceFixer, a unified framework for high-fidelity speech\nrestoration. VoiceFixer restores speech from multiple distortions (e.g., noise,\nreverberation, and clipping) and can expand degraded speech (e.g., noisy\nspeech) with a low bandwidth to 44.1 kHz full-bandwidth high-fidelity speech.\nWe design VoiceFixer based on (1) an analysis stage that predicts\nintermediate-level features from the degraded speech, and (2) a synthesis stage\nthat generates waveform using a neural vocoder. Both objective and subjective\nevaluations show that VoiceFixer is effective on severely degraded speech, such\nas real-world historical speech recordings.

The convergence\nof such hybrid methods to global minimizers hinges on the discretization error\ninduced by restricting the discrete global optimization to the graph, with\ncorresponding implications on choosing an appropriate graph density. A prime\nexample is flight planning, i.e., the computation of optimal routes in view of\nflight time and fuel consumption under given weather conditions. Highly\nefficient discrete shortest path algorithms exist and can be used directly for\ncomputing starting points for locally convergent optimal control methods. We\nderive a priori and localized error bounds for the flight time of discrete\npaths relative to the optimal continuous trajectory, in terms of the graph\ndensity and the given wind field. These bounds allow designing graphs with an\noptimal local connectivity structure. The properties of the bounds are\nillustrated on a set of benchmark problems. It turns out that localization\nimproves the error bound by four orders of magnitude, but still leaves ample\nopportunities for tighter error bounds by a posteriori estimators.",

    "abstract": "Medical data are often highly sensitive, and frequently there are missing\ndata. Due to the data's sensitive nature, there is an interest in creating\nmodelling methods where the data are kept in each local centre to preserve\ntheir privacy, but yet the model can be trained on and learn from data across\nmultiple centres. Such an approach might be distributed machine learning\n(federated learning, collaborative learning) in which a model is iteratively\ncalculated based on aggregated local model information from each centre.\nHowever, even though no specific data are leaving the centre, there is a\npotential risk that the exchanged information is sufficient to reconstruct all\nor part of the patient data, which would hamper the safety-protecting rationale\nidea of distributed learning. This paper demonstrates that the optimisation of\na Cox survival model can lead to patient data leakage. Following this, we\nsuggest a way to optimise and validate a Cox model that avoids these problems\nin a secure way. The feasibility of the suggested method is demonstrated in a\nprovided Matlab code that also includes methods for handling missing data.",

    "abstract": "Satellite-derived measurements are negatively impacted by cloud cover and\nsurface reflectivity. These biases must be discarded and significantly increase\nthe amount of missing data within remote sensing images. This paper expands the\napplication of a partial convolutional neural network (PCNN) to incorporate\ndepthwise convolution layers, conferring temporal dimensionality to the\nimputation process. The addition of a temporal dimension to the imputation\nprocess adds a state of successive existence within the dataset which spatial\nimputation cannot capture. The depthwise convolution process enables the PCNN\nto independently convolve the data for each channel. The deep learning system\nis trained with the Community Multiscale Air Quality model-simulated\ntropospheric column density of Nitrogen Dioxide (TCDNO2) to impute TROPOspheric\nMonitoring Instrument TCDNO2. The depthwise PCNN model achieves an index of\nagreement of 0.82 and outperforms the default PCNN models, with and without\ntemporal dimensionality of data, and conventional data imputation methods such\nas inverse distance weighting by 3-11% and 8-15% in the index of agreement and\ncorrelation, respectively. The model demonstrates more consistency in the\nreconstruction of TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument tropospheric column\ndensity of NO2 images. The model has also demonstrated the accurate imputation\nof remote sensing images with over 95% of the data missing.

    "abstract": "Under suitable assumptions, the algorithms in [Lin, Tong, Quantum 2020] can\nestimate the ground state energy and prepare the ground state of a quantum\nHamiltonian with near-optimal query complexities. However, this is based on a\nblock encoding input model of the Hamiltonian, whose implementation is known to\nrequire a large resource overhead. We develop a tool called quantum eigenvalue\ntransformation of unitary matrices with real polynomials (QET-U), which uses a\ncontrolled Hamiltonian evolution as the input model, a single ancilla qubit and\nno multi-qubit control operations, and is thus suitable for early\nfault-tolerant quantum devices. This leads to a simple quantum algorithm that\noutperforms all previous algorithms with a comparable circuit structure for\nestimating the ground state energy. For a class of quantum spin Hamiltonians,\nwe propose a new method that exploits certain anti-commutation relations and\nfurther removes the need of implementing the controlled Hamiltonian evolution.\nCoupled with Trotter based approximation of the Hamiltonian evolution, the\nresulting algorithm can be very suitable for early fault-tolerant quantum\ndevices. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm using IBM Qiskit for\nthe transverse field Ising model. If we are further allowed to use multi-qubit\nToffoli gates, we can then implement amplitude amplification and a new binary\namplitude estimation algorithm, which increases the circuit depth but decreases\nthe total query complexity. The resulting algorithm saturates the near-optimal\ncomplexity for ground state preparation and energy estimating using a constant\nnumber of ancilla qubits (no more than 3).",

The ability to analyze roughness and texture\neffectively and efficiently is much needed to ensure surface quality in many\nsurface generation processes, such as machining, surface mechanical treatment,\netc. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) are\ntwo commonly used signal decomposition tools for surface roughness and texture\nanalysis. Both methods require selecting a threshold to decompose a given\nsurface into its three main components: form, waviness, and roughness.

This makes utilizing these methods for\nstudying surfaces dependent on the user's judgment and limits their automation\npotential.
