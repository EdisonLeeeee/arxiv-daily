    "abstract": "Driver's cognitive ability at a given moment is the most elusive variable in\nassessing driver's safety. In contrast to other physical conditions, such as\nshort-sight, or manual disability cognitive ability is transient. Safety\nregulations attempt to reduce risk related to driver's cognitive ability by\nremoving risk factors such as alcohol or drug consumption, forbidding secondary\ntasks such as texting, and urging drivers to take breaks when feeling tired.\nHowever, one cannot regulate all factors that affect driver's cognition,\nfurthermore, the driver's momentary cognitive ability in most cases is covert\neven to driver.\nHere, we introduce an active approach aiming at monitoring a specific\ncognitive process that is affected by all these forementioned causes and\ndirectly affects the driver's performance in the driving task. We lean on the\nscientific approach that was framed by Karl Friston (Friston, 2010). We\ndeveloped a closed loop-method in which driver's ocular responses to visual\nprobing were recorded. Machine-learning-algorithms were trained on ocular\nresponses of vigilant condition and were able to detect decrease in capability\ndue fatigue and substance abuse. Our results show that we manage to correctly\nclassify subjects with impaired and unimpaired cognitive process regardless of\nthe cause of impairment (77% accuracy, 5% false alarms).",

    "title": "Identity Preserving Loss for Learned Image Compression",
    "abstract": "Deep learning model inference on embedded devices is challenging due to the\nlimited availability of computation resources. A popular alternative is to\nperform model inference on the cloud, which requires transmitting images from\nthe embedded device to the cloud. Image compression techniques are commonly\nemployed in such cloud-based architectures to reduce transmission latency over\nlow bandwidth networks. This work proposes an end-to-end image compression\nframework that learns domain-specific features to achieve higher compression\nratios than standard HEVC/JPEG compression techniques while maintaining\naccuracy on downstream tasks (e.g., recognition). Our framework does not\nrequire fine-tuning of the downstream task, which allows us to drop-in any\noff-the-shelf downstream task model without retraining. We choose faces as an\napplication domain due to the ready availability of datasets and off-the-shelf\nrecognition models as representative downstream tasks. We present a novel\nIdentity Preserving Reconstruction (IPR) loss function which achieves\nBits-Per-Pixel (BPP) values that are ~38% and ~42% of CRF-23 HEVC compression\nfor LFW (low-resolution) and CelebA-HQ (high-resolution) datasets,\nrespectively, while maintaining parity in recognition accuracy. The superior\ncompression ratio is achieved as the model learns to retain the domain-specific\nfeatures (e.g., facial features) while sacrificing details in the background.\nFurthermore, images reconstructed by our proposed compression model are robust\nto changes in downstream model architectures. We show at-par recognition\nperformance on the LFW dataset with an unseen recognition model while retaining\na lower BPP value of ~38% of CRF-23 HEVC compression.",

    "abstract": "Current tractography methods use the local orientation information to\npropagate streamlines from seed locations. Many such seeds provide streamlines\nthat stop prematurely or fail to map the true pathways because some white\nmatter bundles are \"harder-to-track\" than others. This results in tractography\nreconstructions with poor white and gray matter spatial coverage. In this work,\nwe propose a generative, autoencoder-based method, named GESTA (Generative\nSampling in Tractography using Autoencoders), that produces streamlines with\nbetter spatial coverage. Compared to other deep learning methods, our\nautoencoder-based framework is not constrained by any prior or a fixed set of\nbundles. GESTA produces new and complete streamlines for any white matter\nbundle. GESTA is shown to be effective on both synthetic and human brain in\nvivo data. Our streamline evaluation framework ensures that the streamlines\nproduced by GESTA are anatomically plausible and fit well to the local\ndiffusion signal. The streamline evaluation criteria assess anatomy (white\nmatter coverage), local orientation alignment (direction), geometry features of\nstreamlines, and optionally, gray matter connectivity. The GESTA framework\noffers considerable gains in bundle coverage using a reduced set of seeding\nstreamlines with a 1.5x improvement for the \"Fiber Cup\", and 6x for the ISMRM\n2015 Tractography Challenge datasets. Similarly, it provides a 4x white matter\nvolume increase on the BIL&GIN callosal homotopic dataset. It also successfully\ngenerates new streamlines in poorly populated bundles, such as the fornix and\nother hard-to-track bundles, on in vivo data. GESTA is thus the first deep\ntractography generative method that can improve white matter reconstruction of\nhard-to-track bundles.",

We implement our\nproposed algorithm and demonstrate the expected improvement in computation time\nby comparison to an implementation that evolves the full solution tensor $f$.\nWe also demonstrate that our algorithm can capture dynamics in both the kinetic\nregime, and in the fluid regime with relatively lower computational effort,\nthereby efficiently capturing the asymptotic fluid limit.",

    "abstract": "Strategic voting, or manipulation, is the process by which a voter\nmisrepresents his preferences in an attempt to elect an outcome that he\nconsiders preferable to the outcome under sincere voting. It is generally\nagreed that manipulation is a negative feature of elections, and much effort\nhas been spent on gauging the vulnerability of voting rules to manipulation.\nHowever, the question of why manipulation is actually bad is less commonly\nasked. One way to measure the effect of manipulation on an outcome is by\ncomparing a numeric measure of social welfare under sincere behaviour to that\nin the presence of a manipulator. In this paper we conduct numeric experiments\nto assess the effects of manipulation on social welfare under scoring rules.

One such challenge\npertains to continuous integration testing, which is highly time-constrained,\nand generates a large amount of data coming from iterative code commits and\ntest runs. In such a setting, we can use plentiful test data for training\nmachine learning predictors to identify test cases able to speed up the\ndetection of regression bugs introduced during code integration. However,\ndifferent machine learning models can have different fault prediction\nperformance depending on the context and the parameters of continuous\nintegration testing, for example variable time budget available for continuous\nintegration cycles, or the size of test execution history used for learning to\nprioritize failing test cases. Existing studies on test case prioritization\nrarely study both of these factors, which are essential for the continuous\nintegration practice. In this study we perform a comprehensive comparison of\nthe fault prediction performance of machine learning approaches that have shown\nthe best performance on test case prioritization tasks in the literature. We\nevaluate the accuracy of the classifiers in predicting fault-detecting tests\nfor different values of the continuous integration time budget and with\ndifferent length of test history used for training the classifiers. In\nevaluation, we use real-world industrial datasets from a continuous integration\npractice. The results show that different machine learning models have\ndifferent performance for different size of test history used for model\ntraining and for different time budget available for test case execution. Our\nresults imply that machine learning approaches for test prioritization in\ncontinuous integration testing should be carefully configured to achieve\noptimal performance.",

Deep learning-based methods can achieve accurate training and\nstrong generalization capabilities, but it demands massive labeled data, which\nis often a limitation, especially for agricultural applications. As lacking the\nlabeled data to train an in-situ segmentation model for on-branch soybean pods,\nwe propose a transfer learning from synthetic in-vitro soybean pods. First, we\npresent a novel automated image generation method to rapidly generate a\nsynthetic in-vitro soybean pods dataset with plenty of annotated samples. The\nin-vitro soybean pods samples are overlapped to simulate the frequently\nphysically touching of on-branch soybean pods. Then, we design a two-step\ntransfer learning. In the first step, we finetune an instance segmentation\nnetwork pretrained by a source domain (MS COCO dataset) with a synthetic target\ndomain (in-vitro soybean pods dataset). In the second step, transferring from\nsimulation to reality is performed by finetuning on a few real-world mature\nsoybean plant samples. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the\nproposed two-step transfer learning method, such that AP$_{50}$ was 0.80 for\nthe real-world mature soybean plant test dataset, which is higher than that of\ndirect adaptation and its AP$_{50}$ was 0.77. Furthermore, the visualizations\nof in-situ segmentation results of on-branch soybean pods show that our method\nperforms better than other methods, especially when soybean pods overlap\ndensely.",

In\nparticular, for the task of automatic identification of individual\nHolstein-Friesians in real-world farm CCTV, we show that self-supervision,\nmetric learning, cluster analysis, and active learning can complement each\nother to significantly reduce the annotation requirements usually needed to\ntrain cattle identification frameworks. Evaluating the approach on the test\nportion of the publicly available Cows2021 dataset, for training we use 23,350\nframes across 435 single individual tracklets generated by automated oriented\ncattle detection and tracking in operational farm footage. Self-supervised\nmetric learning is first employed to initialise a candidate identity space\nwhere each tracklet is considered a distinct entity. Grouping entities into\nequivalence classes representing cattle identities is then performed by\nautomated merging via cluster analysis and active learning. Critically, we\nidentify the inflection point at which automated choices cannot replicate\nimprovements based on human intervention to reduce annotation to a minimum.\nExperimental results show that cluster analysis and a few minutes of labelling\nafter automated self-supervision can improve the test identification accuracy\nof 153 identities to 92.44% (ARI=0.93) from the 74.9% (ARI=0.754) obtained by\nself-supervision only.

A common approach to\nobtain a delay bound is to derive a bit-level arrival curve from a packet-level\narrival curve.

    "abstract": "Deep operator learning has emerged as a promising tool for reduced-order\nmodelling and PDE model discovery. Leveraging the expressive power of deep\nneural networks, especially in high dimensions, such methods learn the mapping\nbetween functional state variables. While proposed methods have assumed noise\nonly in the dependent variables, experimental and numerical data for operator\nlearning typically exhibit noise in the independent variables as well, since\nboth variables represent signals that are subject to measurement error. In\nregression on scalar data, failure to account for noisy independent variables\ncan lead to biased parameter estimates. With noisy independent variables,\nlinear models fitted via ordinary least squares (OLS) will show attenuation\nbias, wherein the slope will be underestimated. In this work, we derive an\nanalogue of attenuation bias for linear operator regression with white noise in\nboth the independent and dependent variables. In the nonlinear setting, we\ncomputationally demonstrate underprediction of the action of the Burgers\noperator in the presence of noise in the independent variable. We propose\nerror-in-variables (EiV) models for two operator regression methods,\nMOR-Physics and DeepONet, and demonstrate that these new models reduce bias in\nthe presence of noisy independent variables for a variety of operator learning\nproblems. Considering the Burgers operator in 1D and 2D, we demonstrate that\nEiV operator learning robustly recovers operators in high-noise regimes that\ndefeat OLS operator learning. We also introduce an EiV model for time-evolving\nPDE discovery and show that OLS and EiV perform similarly in learning the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky evolution operator from corrupted data, suggesting that\nthe effect of bias in OLS operator learning depends on the regularity of the\ntarget operator.",

    "abstract": "While most of the current synthesis algorithms only focus on\ncorrectness-by-construction, ensuring robustness has remained a challenge.\nHence, in this paper, we address the robust-by-construction synthesis problem\nby considering the specifications to be expressed by a robust version of Linear\nTemporal Logic (LTL), called robust LTL (rLTL). rLTL has a many-valued\nsemantics to capture different degrees of satisfaction of a specification,\ni.e., satisfaction is a quantitative notion.\nWe argue that the current algorithms for rLTL synthesis do not compute\noptimal strategies in a non-antagonistic setting. So, a natural question is\nwhether there is a way of satisfying the specification \"better\" if the\nenvironment is indeed not antagonistic. We address this question by developing\ntwo new notions of strategies. The first notion is that of adaptive strategies,\nwhich, in response to the opponent's non-antagonistic moves, maximize the\ndegree of satisfaction. The idea is to monitor non-optimal moves of the\nopponent at runtime using multiple parity automata and adaptively change the\nsystem strategy to ensure optimality. The second notion is that of strongly\nadaptive strategies, which is a further refinement of the first notion. These\nstrategies also maximize the opportunities for the opponent to make non-optimal\nmoves. We show that computing such strategies for rLTL specifications is not\nharder than the standard synthesis problem, e.g., computing strategies with LTL\nspecifications, and takes doubly-exponential time.",

We reframe the concept discovery\ntask as an unsupervised semantic segmentation problem, and present SegDiscover,\na novel framework that discovers semantically meaningful visual concepts from\nimagery datasets with complex scenes without supervision. Our method contains\nthree important pieces: generating concept primitives from raw images,\ndiscovering concepts by clustering in the latent space of a self-supervised\npretrained encoder, and concept refinement via neural network smoothing.\nExperimental results provide evidence that our method can discover multiple\nconcepts within a single image and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised\nmethods on complex datasets such as Cityscapes and COCO-Stuff. Our method can\nbe further used as a neural network explanation tool by comparing results\nobtained by different encoders.",

    "abstract": "The AP-LCA problem asks, given an $n$-node directed acyclic graph (DAG), to\ncompute for every pair of vertices $u$ and $v$ in the DAG a lowest common\nancestor (LCA) of $u$ and $v$ if one exists. In this paper we study several\ninteresting variants of AP-LCA, providing both algorithms and fine-grained\nlower bounds for them. The lower bounds we obtain are the first conditional\nlower bounds for LCA problems higher than $n^{\\omega-o(1)}$, where $\\omega$ is\nthe matrix multiplication exponent. Some of our results include:\n- In any DAG, we can detect all vertex pairs that have at most two LCAs and\nlist all of their LCAs in $O(n^\\omega)$ time. This algorithm extends a result\nof [Kowaluk and Lingas ESA'07] which showed an $\\tilde{O}(n^\\omega)$ time\nalgorithm that detects all pairs with a unique LCA in a DAG and outputs their\ncorresponding LCAs.\n- Listing $7$ LCAs per vertex pair in DAGs requires $n^{3-o(1)}$ time under\nthe popular assumption that 3-uniform 5-hyperclique detection requires\n$n^{5-o(1)}$ time. This is surprising since essentially cubic time is\nsufficient to list all LCAs (if $\\omega=2$).\n- Counting the number of LCAs for every vertex pair in a DAG requires\n$n^{3-o(1)}$ time under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, and\n$n^{\\omega(1,2,1)-o(1)}$ time under the $4$-Clique hypothesis. This shows that\nthe algorithm of [Echkardt, M\\\"{u}hling and Nowak ESA'07] for listing all LCAs\nfor every pair of vertices is likely optimal.\n- Given a DAG and a vertex $w_{u,v}$ for every vertex pair $u,v$, verifying\nwhether all $w_{u,v}$ are valid LCAs requires $n^{2.5-o(1)}$ time assuming\n3-uniform 4-hyperclique requires $n^{4 - o(1)}$ time. This defies the common\nintuition that verification is easier than computation since returning some LCA\nper vertex pair can be solved in $O(n^{2.447})$ time [Grandoni et al. SODA'21].",

    "abstract": "Full-precision deep learning models are typically too large or costly to\ndeploy on edge devices. To accommodate to the limited hardware resources,\nmodels are adapted to the edge using various edge-adaptation techniques, such\nas quantization and pruning. While such techniques may have a negligible impact\non top-line accuracy, the adapted models exhibit subtle differences in output\ncompared to the original model from which they are derived. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new evasive attack, DIVA, that exploits these differences in edge\nadaptation, by adding adversarial noise to input data that maximizes the output\ndifference between the original and adapted model. Such an attack is\nparticularly dangerous, because the malicious input will trick the adapted\nmodel running on the edge, but will be virtually undetectable by the original\nmodel, which typically serves as the authoritative model version, used for\nvalidation, debugging and retraining. We compare DIVA to a state-of-the-art\nattack, PGD, and show that DIVA is only 1.7-3.6% worse on attacking the adapted\nmodel but 1.9-4.2 times more likely not to be detected by the the original\nmodel under a whitebox and semi-blackbox setting, compared to PGD.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing need for computational tools to automatically design and\nverify autonomous systems, especially complex robotic systems involving\nperception, planning, control, and hardware in the autonomy stack.\nDifferentiable programming has recently emerged as powerful tool for modeling\nand optimization. However, very few studies have been done to understand how\ndifferentiable programming can be used for robust, certifiable end-to-end\ndesign optimization. In this paper, we fill this gap by combining\ndifferentiable programming for robot design optimization with a novel\nstatistical framework for certifying the robustness of optimized designs. Our\nframework can conduct end-to-end optimization and robustness certification for\nrobotics systems, enabling simultaneous optimization of navigation, perception,\nplanning, control, and hardware subsystems.\nUsing simulation and hardware experiments, we show how our tool can be used\nto solve practical problems in robotics. First, we optimize sensor placements\nfor robot navigation (a design with 5 subsystems and 6 tunable parameters) in\nunder 5 minutes to achieve an 8.4x performance improvement compared to the\ninitial design. Second, we solve a multi-agent collaborative manipulation task\n(3 subsystems and 454 parameters) in under an hour to achieve a 44% performance\nimprovement over the initial design. We find that differentiable programming\nenables much faster (32% and 20x, respectively for each example) optimization\nthan approximate gradient methods. We certify the robustness of each design and\nsuccessfully deploy the optimized designs in hardware. An open-source\nimplementation is available at https://github.com/MIT-REALM/architect",

    "abstract": "Conventional methods for query autocompletion aim to predict which completed\nquery a user will select from a list. A shortcoming of this approach is that\nusers often do not know which query will provide the best retrieval performance\non the current information retrieval system, meaning that any query\nautocompletion methods trained to mimic user behavior can lead to suboptimal\nquery suggestions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approach that\nexplicitly optimizes the query suggestions for downstream retrieval\nperformance. We formulate this as a problem of ranking a set of rankings, where\neach query suggestion is represented by the downstream item ranking it\nproduces. We then present a learning method that ranks query suggestions by the\nquality of their item rankings. The algorithm is based on a counterfactual\nlearning approach that is able to leverage feedback on the items (e.g., clicks,\npurchases) to evaluate query suggestions through an unbiased estimator, thus\navoiding the assumption that users write or select optimal queries. We\nestablish theoretical support for the proposed approach and provide\nlearning-theoretic guarantees. We also present empirical results on publicly\navailable datasets, and demonstrate real-world applicability using data from an\nonline shopping store.",

    "abstract": "To solve video-and-language grounding tasks, the key is for the network to\nunderstand the connection between the two modalities. For a pair of video and\nlanguage description, their semantic relation is reflected by their encodings'\nsimilarity. A good multi-modality encoder should be able to well capture both\ninputs' semantics and encode them in the shared feature space where embedding\ndistance gets properly translated into their semantic similarity. In this work,\nwe focused on this semantic connection between video and language, and\ndeveloped a multi-level alignment training scheme to directly shape the\nencoding process. Global and segment levels of video-language alignment pairs\nwere designed, based on the information similarity ranging from high-level\ncontext to fine-grained semantics. The contrastive loss was used to contrast\nthe encodings' similarities between the positive and negative alignment pairs,\nand to ensure the network is trained in such a way that similar information is\nencoded closely in the shared feature space while information of different\nsemantics is kept apart. Our multi-level alignment training can be applied to\nvarious video-and-language grounding tasks. Together with the task-specific\ntraining loss, our framework achieved comparable performance to previous\nstate-of-the-arts on multiple video QA and retrieval datasets.",

Training such models on\nmassive amounts of data typically requires scaling to many compute nodes and\nrelies heavily on collective communication algorithms, such as all-reduce, to\nexchange the weight gradients between different nodes. The overhead of these\ncollective communication operations in a distributed AI training system can\nbottleneck its performance, with more pronounced effects as the number of nodes\nincreases. In this paper, we first characterize the all-reduce operation\noverhead by profiling distributed AI training. Then, we propose a new smart\nnetwork interface card (NIC) for distributed AI training systems using\nfield-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to accelerate all-reduce operations and\noptimize network bandwidth utilization via data compression. The AI smart NIC\nfrees up the system's compute resources to perform the more compute-intensive\ntensor operations and increases the overall node-to-node communication\nefficiency. We perform real measurements on a prototype distributed AI training\nsystem comprised of 6 compute nodes to evaluate the performance gains of our\nproposed FPGA-based AI smart NIC compared to a baseline system with regular\nNICs. We also use these measurements to validate an analytical model that we\nformulate to predict performance when scaling to larger systems.

    "abstract": "Visual attention helps achieve robust perception under noise, corruption, and\ndistribution shifts in human vision, which are areas where modern neural\nnetworks still fall short. We present VARS, Visual Attention from Recurrent\nSparse reconstruction, a new attention formulation built on two prominent\nfeatures of the human visual attention mechanism: recurrency and sparsity.\nRelated features are grouped together via recurrent connections between\nneurons, with salient objects emerging via sparse regularization. VARS adopts\nan attractor network with recurrent connections that converges toward a stable\npattern over time. Network layers are represented as ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs), formulating attention as a recurrent attractor network that\nequivalently optimizes the sparse reconstruction of input using a dictionary of\n\"templates\" encoding underlying patterns of data. We show that self-attention\nis a special case of VARS with a single-step optimization and no sparsity\nconstraint. VARS can be readily used as a replacement for self-attention in\npopular vision transformers, consistently improving their robustness across\nvarious benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Image forensics, aiming to ensure the authenticity of the image, has made\ngreat progress in dealing with common image manipulation such as copy-move,\nsplicing, and inpainting in the past decades. However, only a few researchers\npay attention to an emerging editing technique called image recoloring, which\ncan manipulate the color values of an image to give it a new style. To prevent\nit from being used maliciously, the previous approaches address the\nconventional recoloring from the perspective of inter-channel correlation and\nillumination consistency. In this paper, we try to explore a solution from the\nperspective of the spatial correlation, which exhibits the generic detection\ncapability for both conventional and deep learning-based recoloring. Through\ntheoretical and numerical analysis, we find that the recoloring operation will\ninevitably destroy the spatial correlation between pixels, implying a new prior\nof statistical discriminability. Based on such fact, we generate a set of\nspatial correlation features and learn the informative representation from the\nset via a convolutional neural network. To train our network, we use three\nrecoloring methods to generate a large-scale and high-quality data set.\nExtensive experimental results in two recoloring scenes demonstrate that the\nspatial correlation features are highly discriminative. Our method achieves the\nstate-of-the-art detection accuracy on multiple benchmark datasets and exhibits\nwell generalization for unknown types of recoloring methods.",

However, existing architectures can only handle data with regular\nstructures, e.g., images or videos, but fail to generalize to graph-structured\ndata beyond Euclidean space, e.g., social networks or document co-citation\nnetworks. Here, we propose an all-optical graph representation learning\narchitecture, termed diffractive graph neural network (DGNN), based on the\nintegrated diffractive photonic computing units (DPUs) to address this\nlimitation. Specifically, DGNN optically encodes node attributes into strip\noptical waveguides, which are transformed by DPUs and aggregated by on-chip\noptical couplers to extract their feature representations. Each DPU comprises\nsuccessive passive layers of metalines to modulate the electromagnetic optical\nfield via diffraction, where the metaline structures are learnable parameters\nshared across graph nodes. DGNN captures complex dependencies among the node\nneighborhoods and eliminates the nonlinear transition functions during the\nlight-speed optical message passing over graph structures. We demonstrate the\nuse of DGNN extracted features for node and graph-level classification tasks\nwith benchmark databases and achieve superior performance.

    "abstract": "Many real-world ubiquitous applications, such as parking recommendations and\nair pollution monitoring, benefit significantly from accurate long-term\nspatio-temporal forecasting (LSTF). LSTF makes use of long-term dependency\nbetween spatial and temporal domains, contextual information, and inherent\npattern in the data. Recent studies have revealed the potential of multi-graph\nneural networks (MGNNs) to improve prediction performance. However, existing\nMGNN methods cannot be directly applied to LSTF due to several issues: the low\nlevel of generality, insufficient use of contextual information, and the\nimbalanced graph fusion approach. To address these issues, we construct new\ngraph models to represent the contextual information of each node and the\nlong-term spatio-temporal data dependency structure. To fuse the information\nacross multiple graphs, we propose a new dynamic multi-graph fusion module to\ncharacterize the correlations of nodes within a graph and the nodes across\ngraphs via the spatial attention and graph attention mechanisms. Furthermore,\nwe introduce a trainable weight tensor to indicate the importance of each node\nin different graphs. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets\ndemonstrate that our proposed approaches significantly improve the performance\nof existing graph neural network models in LSTF prediction tasks.",

    "abstract": "The integration of ML in 5G-based Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks has\nenabled intelligent transportation and smart traffic management. Nonetheless,\nthe security against adversarial attacks is also increasingly becoming a\nchallenging task. Specifically, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is one of the\nwidely used ML designs in IoV applications. The standard ML security techniques\nare not effective in DRL where the algorithm learns to solve sequential\ndecision-making through continuous interaction with the environment, and the\nenvironment is time-varying, dynamic, and mobile. In this paper, we propose a\nGated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based federated continual learning (GFCL) anomaly\ndetection framework against adversarial attacks in IoV.

We use GRU to predict a future data sequence to analyze and\ndetect illegitimate behavior from vehicles in a federated learning-based\ndistributed manner.

    "abstract": "Surface reconstruction from point clouds is vital for 3D computer vision.\nState-of-the-art methods leverage large datasets to first learn local context\npriors that are represented as neural network-based signed distance functions\n(SDFs) with some parameters encoding the local contexts. To reconstruct a\nsurface at a specific query location at inference time, these methods then\nmatch the local reconstruction target by searching for the best match in the\nlocal prior space (by optimizing the parameters encoding the local context) at\nthe given query location. However, this requires the local context prior to\ngeneralize to a wide variety of unseen target regions, which is hard to\nachieve. To resolve this issue, we introduce Predictive Context Priors by\nlearning Predictive Queries for each specific point cloud at inference time.\nSpecifically, we first train a local context prior using a large point cloud\ndataset similar to previous techniques. For surface reconstruction at inference\ntime, however, we specialize the local context prior into our Predictive\nContext Prior by learning Predictive Queries, which predict adjusted spatial\nquery locations as displacements of the original locations. This leads to a\nglobal SDF that fits the specific point cloud the best. Intuitively, the query\nprediction enables us to flexibly search the learned local context prior over\nthe entire prior space, rather than being restricted to the fixed query\nlocations, and this improves the generalizability. Our method does not require\nground truth signed distances, normals, or any additional procedure of signed\ndistance fusion across overlapping regions.

    "abstract": "Unpaired image-to-image translation aims to find a mapping between the source\ndomain and the target domain. To alleviate the problem of the lack of\nsupervised labels for the source images, cycle-consistency based methods have\nbeen proposed for image structure preservation by assuming a reversible\nrelationship between unpaired images. However, this assumption only uses\nlimited correspondence between image pairs. Recently, contrastive learning (CL)\nhas been used to further investigate the image correspondence in unpaired image\ntranslation by using patch-based positive/negative learning. Patch-based\ncontrastive routines obtain the positives by self-similarity computation and\nrecognize the rest patches as negatives. This flexible learning paradigm\nobtains auxiliary contextualized information at a low cost. As the negatives\nown an impressive sample number, with curiosity, we make an investigation based\non a question: are all negatives necessary for feature contrastive learning?\nUnlike previous CL approaches that use negatives as much as possible, in this\npaper, we study the negatives from an information-theoretic perspective and\nintroduce a new negative Pruning technology for Unpaired image-to-image\nTranslation (PUT) by sparsifying and ranking the patches. The proposed\nalgorithm is efficient, flexible and enables the model to learn essential\ninformation between corresponding patches stably.

Feature\nattribution is a prevalent technique of highlighting the explanatory subgraph\nin the input graph, which plausibly leads the GNN model to make its prediction.\nVarious attribution methods exploit gradient-like or attention scores as the\nattributions of edges, then select the salient edges with top attribution\nscores as the explanation. However, most of these works make an untenable\nassumption - the selected edges are linearly independent - thus leaving the\ndependencies among edges largely unexplored, especially their coalition effect.\nWe demonstrate unambiguous drawbacks of this assumption - making the\nexplanatory subgraph unfaithful and verbose. To address this challenge, we\npropose a reinforcement learning agent, Reinforced Causal Explainer\n(RC-Explainer). It frames the explanation task as a sequential decision process\n- an explanatory subgraph is successively constructed by adding a salient edge\nto connect the previously selected subgraph. Technically, its policy network\npredicts the action of edge addition, and gets a reward that quantifies the\naction's causal effect on the prediction. Such reward accounts for the\ndependency of the newly-added edge and the previously-added edges, thus\nreflecting whether they collaborate together and form a coalition to pursue\nbetter explanations. As such, RC-Explainer is able to generate faithful and\nconcise explanations, and has a better generalization power to unseen graphs.\nWhen explaining different GNNs on three graph classification datasets,\nRC-Explainer achieves better or comparable performance to SOTA approaches\nw.r.t. predictive accuracy and contrastivity, and safely passes sanity checks\nand visual inspections.

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential to handle the distribution\nshifts between training and test scenarios. For a new in-distribution (ID)\ndataset, existing methods require retraining to capture the dataset-specific\nfeature representation or data distribution. In this paper, we propose a deep\ngenerative models (DGM) based transferable OOD detection method, which is\nunnecessary to retrain on a new ID dataset. We design an image erasing strategy\nto equip exclusive conditional entropy distribution for each ID dataset, which\ndetermines the discrepancy of DGM's posteriori ucertainty distribution on\ndifferent ID datasets. Owing to the powerful representation capacity of\nconvolutional neural networks, the proposed model trained on complex dataset\ncan capture the above discrepancy between ID datasets without retraining and\nthus achieve transferable OOD detection. We validate the proposed method on\nfive datasets and verity that ours achieves comparable performance to the\nstate-of-the-art group based OOD detection methods that need to be retrained to\ndeploy on new ID datasets.

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen the emergence of many new neural network structures\n(architectures and layers). To solve a given task, a network requires a certain\nset of abilities reflected in its structure. The required abilities depend on\neach task. There is so far no systematic study of the real capacities of the\nproposed neural structures. The question of what each structure can and cannot\nachieve is only partially answered by its performance on common benchmarks.\nIndeed, natural data contain complex unknown statistical cues. It is therefore\nimpossible to know what cues a given neural structure is taking advantage of in\nsuch data. In this work, we sketch a methodology to measure the effect of each\nstructure on a network's ability, by designing ad hoc synthetic datasets. Each\ndataset is tailored to assess a given ability and is reduced to its simplest\nform: each input contains exactly the amount of information needed to solve the\ntask. We illustrate our methodology by building three datasets to evaluate each\nof the three following network properties: a) the ability to link local cues to\ndistant inferences, b) the translation covariance and c) the ability to group\npixels with the same characteristics and share information among them. Using a\nfirst simplified depth estimation dataset, we pinpoint a serious nonlocal\ndeficit of the U-Net. We then evaluate how to resolve this limitation by\nembedding its structure with nonlocal layers, which allow computing complex\nfeatures with long-range dependencies. Using a second dataset, we compare\ndifferent positional encoding methods and use the results to further improve\nthe U-Net on the depth estimation task. The third introduced dataset serves to\ndemonstrate the need for self-attention-like mechanisms for resolving more\nrealistic depth estimation tasks.",

    "abstract": "Side information fusion for sequential recommendation (SR) aims to\neffectively leverage various side information to enhance the performance of\nnext-item prediction. Most state-of-the-art methods build on self-attention\nnetworks and focus on exploring various solutions to integrate the item\nembedding and side information embeddings before the attention layer. However,\nour analysis shows that the early integration of various types of embeddings\nlimits the expressiveness of attention matrices due to a rank bottleneck and\nconstrains the flexibility of gradients. Also, it involves mixed correlations\namong the different heterogeneous information resources, which brings extra\ndisturbance to attention calculation. Motivated by this, we propose Decoupled\nSide Information Fusion for Sequential Recommendation (DIF-SR), which moves the\nside information from the input to the attention layer and decouples the\nattention calculation of various side information and item representation. We\ntheoretically and empirically show that the proposed solution allows\nhigher-rank attention matrices and flexible gradients to enhance the modeling\ncapacity of side information fusion. Also, auxiliary attribute predictors are\nproposed to further activate the beneficial interaction between side\ninformation and item representation learning. Extensive experiments on four\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed solution stably outperforms\nstate-of-the-art SR models. Further studies show that our proposed solution can\nbe readily incorporated into current attention-based SR models and\nsignificantly boost performance.

    "title": "On the semantics of big Earth observation data for land classification",
    "abstract": "This paper discusses the challenges of using big Earth observation data for\nland classification. The approach taken is to consider pure data-driven methods\nto be insufficient to represent continuous change. We argue for sound theories\nwhen working with big data. After revising existing classification schemes such\nas FAO's Land Cover Classification System (LCCS), we conclude that LCCS and\nsimilar proposals cannot capture the complexity of landscape dynamics. We then\ninvestigate concepts that are being used for analyzing satellite image time\nseries; we show these concepts to be instances of events. Therefore, for\ncontinuous monitoring of land change, event recognition needs to replace object\nidentification as the prevailing paradigm. The paper concludes by showing how\nevent semantics can improve data-driven methods to fulfil the potential of big\ndata.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation is important in medical image analysis. Inspired by the\nstrong ability of traditional image analysis techniques in capturing shape\npriors and inter-subject similarity, many deep learning (DL) models have been\nrecently proposed to exploit such prior information and achieved robust\nperformance. However, these two types of important prior information are\nusually studied separately in existing models. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel DL model to model both type of priors within a single framework.\nSpecifically, we introduce an extra encoder into the classic encoder-decoder\nstructure to form a Siamese structure for the encoders, where one of them takes\na target image as input (the image-encoder), and the other concatenates a\ntemplate image and its foreground regions as input (the template-encoder). The\ntemplate-encoder encodes the shape priors and appearance characteristics of\neach foreground class in the template image. A cosine similarity based\nattention module is proposed to fuse the information from both encoders, to\nutilize both types of prior information encoded by the template-encoder and\nmodel the inter-subject similarity for each foreground class. Extensive\nexperiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can\nproduce superior performance to competing methods.",

    "abstract": "Modern recommender systems operate in a fully server-based fashion. To cater\nto millions of users, the frequent model maintaining and the high-speed\nprocessing for concurrent user requests are required, which comes at the cost\nof a huge carbon footprint. Meanwhile, users need to upload their behavior data\neven including the immediate environmental context to the server, raising the\npublic concern about privacy. On-device recommender systems circumvent these\ntwo issues with cost-conscious settings and local inference. However, due to\nthe limited memory and computing resources, on-device recommender systems are\nconfronted with two fundamental challenges: (1) how to reduce the size of\nregular models to fit edge devices? (2) how to retain the original capacity?\nPrevious research mostly adopts tensor decomposition techniques to compress the\nregular recommendation model with limited compression ratio so as to avoid\ndrastic performance degradation. In this paper, we explore ultra-compact models\nfor next-item recommendation, by loosing the constraint of dimensionality\nconsistency in tensor decomposition. Meanwhile, to compensate for the capacity\nloss caused by compression, we develop a self-supervised knowledge distillation\nframework which enables the compressed model (student) to distill the essential\ninformation lying in the raw data, and improves the long-tail item\nrecommendation through an embedding-recombination strategy with the original\nmodel (teacher). The extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that,\nwith 30x model size reduction, the compressed model almost comes with no\naccuracy loss, and even outperforms its uncompressed counterpart in most cases.",

High user mobility in first responder or tactical\nenvironments makes MEC challenging, as wireless links observe substantial\nfluctuations. Typical cloud-based coordination (e.g., ZooKeeper-based service\ndiscovery and coordination, device naming, security) needed by edge computing\ntasks cannot work in these environments. Driven by the need for a resilient and\nlightweight coordination service, in this paper, we design and implement \\ek to\nprovide cloud-like coordination for MEC systems.

It maintains an edge cluster among devices and\nintelligently stores its data on a group of replicas to guard against node\nfailure and disconnections.

Both the leader and the follower have their own\n(multi-dimensional) budgets, respectively. Each item is associated with a\nprofit, which is the same to the leader and the follower, and will consume the\nleader's (follower's) budget if it is selected by the leader (follower). The\nleader and the follower will select items in a sequential way: First, the\nleader selects items within the leader's budget. Then the follower selects\nitems from the remaining items within the follower's budget. The goal of the\nleader is to minimize the maximum profit that the follower can obtain. Let\n$s_A$ and $s_B$ be the dimension of the leader's and follower's budget,\nrespectively. A special case of our problem is the bilevel knapsack problem\nstudied by Caprara et al.

We\nalso complement our result by showing that there does not exist any\n$(4/3-\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm even if $s_A=1$ and $s_B=2$. We also\nconsider a variant of our problem with resource augmentation when $s_A$ and\n$s_B$ are both part of the input.

Learning from demonstration (LfD) techniques can be used to automate\nsome of the surgical subtasks for the construction of the shared control\nmechanism. However, a sufficient amount of data is required for the robot to\nlearn the manoeuvres. Using a surgical simulator to collect data is a less\nresource-demanding approach. With sim-to-real adaptation, the manoeuvres\nlearned from a simulator can be transferred to a physical robot. To this end,\nwe propose a sim-to-real adaptation method to construct a human-robot shared\ncontrol framework for robotic surgery.\nIn this paper, a desired trajectory is generated from a simulator using LfD\nmethod, while dynamic motion primitives (DMP) is used to transfer the desired\ntrajectory from the simulator to the physical robotic platform. Moreover, a\nrole adaptation mechanism is developed such that the robot can adjust its role\naccording to the surgical operation contexts predicted by a neural network\nmodel. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated on the da Vinci\nResearch Kit (dVRK).

    "abstract": "Developing modern machine learning (ML) applications is data-centric, of\nwhich one fundamental challenge is to understand the influence of data quality\nto ML training -- \"Which training examples are 'guilty' in making the trained\nML model predictions inaccurate or unfair?\" Modeling data influence for ML\ntraining has attracted intensive interest over the last decade, and one popular\nframework is to compute the Shapley value of each training example with respect\nto utilities such as validation accuracy and fairness of the trained ML model.\nUnfortunately, despite recent intensive interest and research, existing methods\nonly consider a single ML model \"in isolation\" and do not consider an\nend-to-end ML pipeline that consists of data transformations, feature\nextractors, and ML training.\nWe present Ease.ML/DataScope, the first system that efficiently computes\nShapley values of training examples over an end-to-end ML pipeline, and\nillustrate its applications in data debugging for ML training. To this end, we\nfirst develop a novel algorithmic framework that computes Shapley value over a\nspecific family of ML pipelines that we call canonical pipelines: a positive\nrelational algebra query followed by a K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) classifier. We\nshow that, for many subfamilies of canonical pipelines, computing Shapley value\nis in PTIME, contrasting the exponential complexity of computing Shapley value\nin general. We then put this to practice -- given an sklearn pipeline, we\napproximate it with a canonical pipeline to use as a proxy. We conduct\nextensive experiments illustrating different use cases and utilities. Our\nresults show that DataScope is up to four orders of magnitude faster over\nstate-of-the-art Monte Carlo-based methods, while being comparably, and often\neven more, effective in data debugging.",

A\nlow-effort modality for task specification is critical for engagement of\nnon-expert end-users and ultimate adoption of personalized robot agents. A\nwidely studied approach to task specification is through goals, using either\ncompact state vectors or goal images from the same robot scene.

    "abstract": "Data assimilation presents computational challenges because many\nhigh-fidelity models must be simulated. Various deep-learning-based surrogate\nmodeling techniques have been developed to reduce the simulation costs\nassociated with these applications. However, to construct data-driven surrogate\nmodels, several thousand high-fidelity simulation runs may be required to\nprovide training samples, and these computations can make training\nprohibitively expensive. To address this issue, in this work we present a\nframework where most of the training simulations are performed on coarsened\ngeomodels. These models are constructed using a flow-based upscaling method.\nThe framework entails the use of a transfer-learning procedure, incorporated\nwithin an existing recurrent residual U-Net architecture, in which network\ntraining is accomplished in three steps. In the first step. where the bulk of\nthe training is performed, only low-fidelity simulation results are used. The\nsecond and third steps, in which the output layer is trained and the overall\nnetwork is fine-tuned, require a relatively small number of high-fidelity\nsimulations. Here we use 2500 low-fidelity runs and 200 high-fidelity runs,\nwhich leads to about a 90% reduction in training simulation costs. The method\nis applied for two-phase subsurface flow in 3D channelized systems, with flow\ndriven by wells. The surrogate model trained with multifidelity data is shown\nto be nearly as accurate as a reference surrogate trained with only\nhigh-fidelity data in predicting dynamic pressure and saturation fields in new\ngeomodels. Importantly, the network provides results that are significantly\nmore accurate than the low-fidelity simulations used for most of the training.\nThe multifidelity surrogate is also applied for history matching using an\nensemble-based procedure, where accuracy relative to reference results is again\ndemonstrated.",

This task remains challenging for current deep learning\nalgorithms since it requires addressing three key technical problems jointly:\n1) identifying object entities and their properties, 2) inferring semantic\nrelations between pairs of entities, and 3) generalizing to novel\nobject-relation combinations, i.e., systematic generalization. In this work, we\nuse vision transformers (ViTs) as our base model for visual reasoning and make\nbetter use of concepts defined as object entities and their relations to\nimprove the reasoning ability of ViTs. Specifically, we introduce a novel\nconcept-feature dictionary to allow flexible image feature retrieval at\ntraining time with concept keys. This dictionary enables two new concept-guided\nauxiliary tasks: 1) a global task for promoting relational reasoning, and 2) a\nlocal task for facilitating semantic object-centric correspondence learning. To\nexamine the systematic generalization of visual reasoning models, we introduce\nsystematic splits for the standard HICO and GQA benchmarks. We show the\nresulting model, Concept-guided Vision Transformer (or RelViT for short)\nsignificantly outperforms prior approaches on HICO and GQA by 16% and 13% in\nthe original split, and by 43% and 18% in the systematic split. Our ablation\nanalyses also reveal our model's compatibility with multiple ViT variants and\nrobustness to hyper-parameters.",

    "abstract": "Transductive inference is widely used in few-shot learning, as it leverages\nthe statistics of the unlabeled query set of a few-shot task, typically\nyielding substantially better performances than its inductive counterpart. The\ncurrent few-shot benchmarks use perfectly class-balanced tasks at inference. We\nargue that such an artificial regularity is unrealistic, as it assumes that the\nmarginal label probability of the testing samples is known and fixed to the\nuniform distribution. In fact, in realistic scenarios, the unlabeled query sets\ncome with arbitrary and unknown label marginals. We introduce and study the\neffect of arbitrary class distributions within the query sets of few-shot tasks\nat inference, removing the class-balance artefact. Specifically, we model the\nmarginal probabilities of the classes as Dirichlet-distributed random\nvariables, which yields a principled and realistic sampling within the simplex.\nThis leverages the current few-shot benchmarks, building testing tasks with\narbitrary class distributions. We evaluate experimentally state-of-the-art\ntransductive methods over 3 widely used data sets, and observe, surprisingly,\nsubstantial performance drops, even below inductive methods in some cases.\nFurthermore, we propose a generalization of the mutual-information loss, based\non $\\alpha$-divergences, which can handle effectively class-distribution\nvariations.

A ground robot explores an indoor\nspace with a single floor and vertical walls, and collects a sequence of\nintensity images and 2D LiDAR datasets. The LiDAR provides accurate depth\ninformation, while the camera captures high-resolution data for semantic\ninterpretation. The alignment of sensor outputs and image segmentation are\ncomputed jointly by aligning LiDAR points, as samples of the room contour, to\nground-wall boundaries in the images. The alignment problem is decoupled into a\ntop-down view projection and a 2D similarity transformation estimation, which\ncan be solved according to the vertical vanishing point and motion of two\nsensors. The recursive random sample consensus algorithm is implemented to\ngenerate, evaluate and optimize multiple hypotheses with the sequential\nmeasurements.

The ambiguity in images for\nground-wall boundary extraction is removed with the assistance of LiDAR\nobservations, which improves the accuracy of semantic segmentation.

    "abstract": "Ever since the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic by the World Health\nOrganization in 2020, the world has continued to struggle in controlling and\ncontaining the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nThis has been especially challenging with the rise of the Omicron variant and\nits subvariants and recombinants, which has led to a significant increase in\npatients seeking treatment and has put a tremendous burden on hospitals and\nhealthcare systems. A major challenge faced during the pandemic has been the\nprediction of survival and the risk for additional injuries in individual\npatients, which requires significant clinical expertise and additional\nresources to avoid further complications. In this study we propose COVID-Net\nBiochem, an explainability-driven framework for building machine learning\nmodels to predict patient survival and the chance of developing kidney injury\nduring hospitalization from clinical and biochemistry data in a transparent and\nsystematic manner. In the first \"clinician-guided initial design\" phase, we\nprepared a benchmark dataset of carefully selected clinical and biochemistry\ndata based on clinician assessment, which were curated from a patient cohort of\n1366 patients at Stony Brook University. A collection of different machine\nlearning models with a diversity of gradient based boosting tree architectures\nand deep transformer architectures was designed and trained specifically for\nsurvival and kidney injury prediction based on the carefully selected clinical\nand biochemical markers.",

    "title": "Progressive Learning for Image Retrieval with Hybrid-Modality Queries",
    "abstract": "Image retrieval with hybrid-modality queries, also known as composing text\nand image for image retrieval (CTI-IR), is a retrieval task where the search\nintention is expressed in a more complex query format, involving both vision\nand text modalities. For example, a target product image is searched using a\nreference product image along with text about changing certain attributes of\nthe reference image as the query. It is a more challenging image retrieval task\nthat requires both semantic space learning and cross-modal fusion. Previous\napproaches that attempt to deal with both aspects achieve unsatisfactory\nperformance. In this paper, we decompose the CTI-IR task into a three-stage\nlearning problem to progressively learn the complex knowledge for image\nretrieval with hybrid-modality queries. We first leverage the semantic\nembedding space for open-domain image-text retrieval, and then transfer the\nlearned knowledge to the fashion-domain with fashion-related pre-training\ntasks. Finally, we enhance the pre-trained model from single-query to\nhybrid-modality query for the CTI-IR task. Furthermore, as the contribution of\nindividual modality in the hybrid-modality query varies for different retrieval\nscenarios, we propose a self-supervised adaptive weighting strategy to\ndynamically determine the importance of image and text in the hybrid-modality\nquery for better retrieval. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the mean of Recall@K by\n24.9% and 9.5% on the Fashion-IQ and Shoes benchmark datasets respectively.",

    "abstract": "Depth Estimation and Object Detection Recognition play an important role in\nautonomous driving technology under the guidance of deep learning artificial\nintelligence. We propose a hybrid structure called RealNet: a co-design method\ncombining the model-streamlined recognition algorithm, the depth estimation\nalgorithm with information fusion, and deploying them on the Jetson-Nano for\nunmanned vehicles with monocular vision sensors. We use ROS for experiment. The\nmethod proposed in this paper is suitable for mobile platforms with high\nreal-time request. Innovation of our method is using information fusion to\ncompensate the problem of insufficient frame rate of output image, and improve\nthe robustness of target detection and depth estimation under monocular\nvision.Object Detection is based on YOLO-v5. We have simplified the network\nstructure of its DarkNet53 and realized a prediction speed up to 0.01s. Depth\nEstimation is based on the VNL Depth Estimation, which considers multiple\ngeometric constraints in 3D global space. It calculates the loss function by\ncalculating the deviation of the virtual normal vector VN and the label, which\ncan obtain deeper depth information. We use PnP fusion algorithm to solve the\nproblem of insufficient frame rate of depth map output. It solves the motion\nestimation depth from three-dimensional target to two-dimensional point based\non corner feature matching, which is faster than VNL calculation. We\ninterpolate VNL output and PnP output to achieve information fusion.\nExperiments show that this can effectively eliminate the jitter of depth\ninformation and improve robustness. At the control end, this method combines\nthe results of target detection and depth estimation to calculate the target\nposition, and uses a pure tracking control algorithm to track it.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies on the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) show that pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLMs) like BERT contain matching subnetworks that have similar\ntransfer learning performance as the original PLM. These subnetworks are found\nusing magnitude-based pruning. In this paper, we find that the BERT subnetworks\nhave even more potential than these studies have shown. Firstly, we discover\nthat the success of magnitude pruning can be attributed to the preserved\npre-training performance, which correlates with the downstream transferability.\nInspired by this, we propose to directly optimize the subnetwork structure\ntowards the pre-training objectives, which can better preserve the pre-training\nperformance. Specifically, we train binary masks over model weights on the\npre-training tasks, with the aim of preserving the universal transferability of\nthe subnetwork, which is agnostic to any specific downstream tasks. We then\nfine-tune the subnetworks on the GLUE benchmark and the SQuAD dataset. The\nresults show that, compared with magnitude pruning, mask training can\neffectively find BERT subnetworks with improved overall performance on\ndownstream tasks. Moreover, our method is also more efficient in searching\nsubnetworks and more advantageous when fine-tuning within a certain range of\ndata scarcity.

Second, inputs the dataset together with its\ncorresponding graph into the GNN for training, which contains graphs in each\nhidden layer of the network, enabling the graph neural network to learn the\nfeature values of itself and its neighbors, and the obtained early features\nhave stronger discriminability.

The motivation for this sharing is to help reproducibility\nor research -- the platform can be useful for others as a testbed for control\nalgorithms for this class of dynamical systems, for instance, distributed\ncontrol or control of flexible structures. In the second part of the paper, we\nthen showcase the platform using two control problem formulations tailored to\nthe FK model -- we discuss the practical motivation for studying these\nproblems, propose (some) methods for solving them and demonstrate the\nfunctionality using experiments. In particular, the first control formulation\ndeals with non-collocated control/regulation of a single pendulum through one\nboundary of the array in the presence of a disturbance sent from the other\nboundary; the second control problem consists in synchronizing pendulums'\nangular speeds.

Our main result demonstrates that deep networks\nwith piecewise linear activation (e.g. ReLU or PReLU) are fundamentally more\nexpressive than deep feedforward networks with analytic (e.g. sigmoid, Swish,\nGeLU, or Softplus). More specifically, we construct a strict refinement of the\ntopology on the space $L^1_{\\operatorname{loc}}(\\mathbb{R}^d,\\mathbb{R}^D)$ of\nlocally Lebesgue-integrable functions, in which the set of deep ReLU networks\nwith (bilinear) pooling $\\operatorname{NN}^{\\operatorname{ReLU} +\n\\operatorname{Pool}}$ is dense (i.e. universal) but the set of deep feedforward\nnetworks defined using any combination of analytic activation functions with\n(or without) pooling layers $\\operatorname{NN}^{\\omega+\\operatorname{Pool}}$ is\nnot dense (i.e. not universal).

To merge these two forms of\nknowledge into the dialogue effectively, we design a dynamic virtual knowledge\nselector and a controller that help to enrich and expand knowledge space.\nMoreover, DMKCM adopts a novel dynamic knowledge memory module that effectively\nuses historical reasoning knowledge to generate better responses.

    "title": "Regulating Group Exposure for Item Providers in Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Engaging all content providers, including newcomers or minority demographic\ngroups, is crucial for online platforms to keep growing and working. Hence,\nwhile building recommendation services, the interests of those providers should\nbe valued. In this paper, we consider providers as grouped based on a common\ncharacteristic in settings in which certain provider groups have low\nrepresentation of items in the catalog and, thus, in the user interactions.\nThen, we envision a scenario wherein platform owners seek to control the degree\nof exposure to such groups in the recommendation process. To support this\nscenario, we rely on disparate exposure measures that characterize the gap\nbetween the share of recommendations given to groups and the target level of\nexposure pursued by the platform owners. We then propose a re-ranking procedure\nthat ensures desired levels of exposure are met. Experiments show that, while\nsupporting certain groups of providers by rendering them with the target\nexposure, beyond-accuracy objectives experience significant gains with\nnegligible impact in recommendation utility.",

    "abstract": "The new concept of semi-integrated-sensing-and-communication (Semi-ISaC) is\nproposed for next-generation cellular networks. We propose a novel Semi-ISaC\nframework which provides more freedom as it allows that a portion of the\nbandwidth is exclusively used for either wireless communication or for radar\ndetection, while the rest is for ISaC transmission. To enhance the bandwidth\nefficiency (BE), we investigate the evolution of Semi-ISaC networks from\northogonal multiple access (OMA) to non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA).\nFirst, we evaluate the performance of an OMA-based Semi-ISaC network. As for\nthe communication signals, we investigate both the outage probability (OP) and\nthe ergodic rate. As for the radar echoes, we characterize the ergodic radar\nestimation information rate (REIR). Based on these metrics, we derive the\nanalytical and asymptotic expressions of the ergodic RIER. Then, we investigate\nthe performance of a NOMA-based Semi-ISaC network. More specifically, we derive\nthe analytical expressions of both the OP and of the ergodic rate for the\ncommunication signals. The asymptotic expressions of OP are also derived for\nquantifying the diversity gains of the communication signals. As for the radar\nechoes, we derive the analytical and asymptotic ergodic REIR. The high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) slopes are also evaluated. The analytical results\nindicate that: 1) Under a two-user NOMA Semi-ISaC scenario, the diversity order\nof the near-user equals to the coefficient of the Nakagami-m fading channels\n($m$), while that of the far-user is zero; and 2) The high-SNR slope for the\nergodic REIR is based on the ratio of the radar signal's duty cycle and the\npulse duration. Our simulation results show that: 1) Semi-ISaC has better\nchannel capacity than conventional ISaC; and 2) NOMA-based Semi-ISaC has better\nchannel capacity than OMA-based Semi-ISaC.",

    "abstract": "It has been observed in practice that Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs)\nmay not always contribute to the minimization of Area Control Error (ACE). This\nphenomenon of \"counterproductive regulation\" is open to a number of\ninterpretations. For one thing, cost-effective coordination of distributed\nBESSs has not been well-established and requires much more research efforts.\nFor another, the BESSs could be driven into an inefficient operation due to\nmiscalculated ACE. Moreover, some BESSs may have to operate in the opposite\ndirection than desired in order to recover an energy-neutral state. Leveraging\ncorrected ACE signals, this paper explores a novel scheme termed\nOptimization-based Ramping Reserve Allocation (ORRA) to coordinate a group of\nBESSs in Automatic Generation Control (AGC). The underlying methodology is to\ncounteract net-load forecasting errors by providing only ramping reserves\nrather than capacity reserves to AGC, based on which an online optimization\nproblem is formulated to minimize the associated battery usage cost of all\nnodes. The corresponding optimization algorithm is purely distributed and can\nguarantee fair and near-optimal allocation in real-time while avoiding those\ncounterproductive behaviors mentioned above.

Unfortunately, for many applications\nthat perform a high rate of data updates, state-of-the-art HTAP systems incur\nsignificant losses in transactional (up to 74.6%) and/or analytical (up to\n49.8%) throughput compared to performing only transactional or only analytical\nqueries in isolation, due to (1) data movement between the CPU and memory, (2)\ndata update propagation from transactional to analytical workloads, and (3) the\ncost to maintain a consistent view of data across the system.\nWe propose Polynesia, a hardware-software co-designed system for in-memory\nHTAP databases that avoids the large throughput losses of traditional HTAP\nsystems.

Most existing self-supervised and unsupervised approaches in the\ntime-series domain do not capture low and high-frequency features at the same\ntime. Further, some of these methods employ large scale models like\ntransformers or rely on computationally expensive techniques such as\ncontrastive learning. To tackle these problems, we propose a non-contrastive\nself-supervised learning approach efficiently captures low and high-frequency\ntime-varying features in a cost-effective manner. Our method takes raw time\nseries data as input and creates two different augmented views for two branches\nof the model, by randomly sampling the augmentations from same family.\nFollowing the terminology of BYOL, the two branches are called online and\ntarget network which allows bootstrapping of the latent representation. In\ncontrast to BYOL, where a backbone encoder is followed by multilayer perceptron\n(MLP) heads, the proposed model contains additional temporal convolutional\nnetwork (TCN) heads. As the augmented views are passed through large kernel\nconvolution blocks of the encoder, the subsequent combination of MLP and TCN\nenables an effective representation of low as well as high-frequency\ntime-varying features due to the varying receptive fields. The two modules (MLP\nand TCN) act in a complementary manner. We train an online network where each\nmodule learns to predict the outcome of the respective module of target network\nbranch.

    "abstract": "Broadband Internet service is widely expected to be the fundamental universal\nservice for the 21st century. But more than a decade of national and\ninternational struggles to close the digital divide between broadband haves and\nhave nots suggest that reaching global universality will be a very difficult\ntask. This paper argues that the strong guarantees made by the current\nbroadband paradigm - low latency and constant availability - are unnecessary\nobstacles to its adoption as an affordable and universal digital service. We\nshow that there is nonetheless a plausible strategy for deploying a Basic\nBroadband service that does not require such guarantees and is able to offer,\nat reasonable cost, almost all the critical and valuable services and\napplications currently delivered over low latency broadband, synchronous\ntelepresence excepted.",

    "abstract": "The development of analytical software for big Earth observation data faces\nseveral challenges. Designers need to balance between conflicting factors.\nSolutions that are efficient for specific hardware architectures can not be\nused in other environments. Packages that work on generic hardware and open\nstandards will not have the same performance as dedicated solutions. Software\nthat assumes that its users are computer programmers are flexible but may be\ndifficult to learn for a wide audience. This paper describes sits, an\nopen-source R package for satellite image time series analysis using machine\nlearning. To allow experts to use satellite imagery to the fullest extent, sits\nadopts a time-first, space-later approach. It supports the complete cycle of\ndata analysis for land classification. Its API provides a simple but powerful\nset of functions. The software works in different cloud computing environments.\nSatellite image time series are input to machine learning classifiers, and the\nresults are post-processed using spatial smoothing. Since machine learning\nmethods need accurate training data, sits includes methods for quality\nassessment of training samples. The software also provides methods for\nvalidation and accuracy measurement. The package thus comprises a production\nenvironment for big EO data analysis. We show that this approach produces high\naccuracy for land use and land cover maps through a case study in the Cerrado\nbiome, one of the world's fast moving agricultural frontiers for the year 2018.",

    "title": "A Generic Approach to Quantitative Verification",
    "abstract": "This thesis is concerned with quantitative verification, that is, the\nverification of quantitative properties of quantitative systems. These systems\nare found in numerous applications, and their quantitative verification is\nimportant, but also rather challenging. In particular, given that most systems\nfound in applications are rather big, compositionality and incrementality of\nverification methods are essential.\nIn order to ensure robustness of verification, we replace the Boolean yes-no\nanswers of standard verification with distances. Depending on the application\ncontext, many different types of distances are being employed in quantitative\nverification. Consequently, there is a need for a general theory of system\ndistances which abstracts away from the concrete distances and develops\nquantitative verification at a level independent of the distance. It is our\nview that in a theory of quantitative verification, the quantitative aspects\nshould be treated just as much as input to a verification problem as the\nqualitative aspects are. In this work we develop such a general theory of\nquantitative verification. We assume as input a distance between traces, or\nexecutions, and then employ the theory of games with quantitative objectives to\ndefine distances between quantitative systems. Different versions of the\nquantitative bisimulation game give rise to different types of distances,\nviz.~bisimulation distance, simulation distance, trace equivalence distance,\netc., enabling us to construct a quantitative generalization of van Glabbeek's\nlinear-time--branching-time spectrum. We also extend our general theory of\nquantitative verification to a theory of quantitative specifications. For this\nwe use modal transition systems, and we develop the quantitative properties of\nthe usual operators for behavioral specification theories.",

The attacker uses\nadversarial optimization to maximize raw similarity of speaker embeddings\nbetween a seed speech sample and a proxy population.

By using the attack with\na black-box voice cloning system, we obtain master voices that are effective in\nthe most challenging conditions and transferable between speaker encoders.

    "abstract": "The need for reducing manufacturing defect escape in today's safety-critical\napplications requires increased fault coverage. However, generating a test set\nusing commercial automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) tools that lead to\nzero-defect escape is still an open problem. It is challenging to detect all\nstuck-at faults to reach 100% fault coverage. In parallel, the hardware\nsecurity community has been actively involved in developing solutions for logic\nlocking to prevent IP piracy. Locks (e.g., XOR gates) are inserted in different\nlocations of the netlist so that an adversary cannot determine the secret key.\nUnfortunately, the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) based attack, introduced in\n[1], can break different logic locking schemes in minutes. In this paper, we\npropose a novel test pattern generation approach using the powerful SAT attack\non logic locking. A stuck-at fault is modeled as a locked gate with a secret\nkey. Our modeling of stuck-at faults preserves the property of fault activation\nand propagation. We show that the input pattern that determines the key is a\ntest for the stuck-at fault. We propose two different approaches for test\npattern generation. First, a single stuck-at fault is targeted, and a\ncorresponding locked circuit with one key bit is created. This approach\ngenerates one test pattern per fault. Second, we consider a group of faults and\nconvert the circuit to its locked version with multiple key bits. The inputs\nobtained from the SAT tool are the test set for detecting this group of faults.\nOur approach is able to find test patterns for hard-to-detect faults that were\npreviously failed in commercial ATPG tools. The proposed test pattern\ngeneration approach can efficiently detect redundant faults present in a\ncircuit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on ITC'99 benchmarks.\nThe results show that we can achieve a perfect fault coverage reaching 100%.",

    "abstract": "As 3D facial avatars become more widely used for communication, it is\ncritical that they faithfully convey emotion. Unfortunately, the best recent\nmethods that regress parametric 3D face models from monocular images are unable\nto capture the full spectrum of facial expression, such as subtle or extreme\nemotions. We find the standard reconstruction metrics used for training\n(landmark reprojection error, photometric error, and face recognition loss) are\ninsufficient to capture high-fidelity expressions. The result is facial\ngeometries that do not match the emotional content of the input image. We\naddress this with EMOCA (EMOtion Capture and Animation), by introducing a novel\ndeep perceptual emotion consistency loss during training, which helps ensure\nthat the reconstructed 3D expression matches the expression depicted in the\ninput image. While EMOCA achieves 3D reconstruction errors that are on par with\nthe current best methods, it significantly outperforms them in terms of the\nquality of the reconstructed expression and the perceived emotional content. We\nalso directly regress levels of valence and arousal and classify basic\nexpressions from the estimated 3D face parameters.

Though highly effective, these neural approaches are very\nexpensive to run, making them difficult to deploy under strict latency\nconstraints. To address this limitation, recent studies have proposed new\nfamilies of learned sparse models that try to match the effectiveness of\nlearned dense models, while leveraging the traditional inverted index data\nstructure for efficiency. Current learned sparse models learn the weights of\nterms in documents and, sometimes, queries; however, they exploit different\nvocabulary structures, document expansion techniques, and query expansion\nstrategies, which can make them slower than traditional sparse models such as\nBM25. In this work, we propose a novel indexing and query processing technique\nthat exploits a traditional sparse model's \"guidance\" to efficiently traverse\nthe index, allowing the more effective learned model to execute fewer scoring\noperations.

The model takes the\nform of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), whose states\nare given by the number of subjects in different health conditions. The model\nalso exposes the different parameters that have an impact on the spread of the\ndisease and the various decision variables that can be used to control it (e.g,\nsocial distancing, number of tests administered to single out infected\nsubjects). The model describes the stochastic phenomena that underlie the\nspread of the epidemic and captures, in the form of deterministic parameters,\nsome fundamental limitations in the availability of resources (hospital beds\nand test swabs). The model lends itself to different uses. For a given control\npolicy, it is possible to verify if it satisfies an analytical property on the\nstochastic evolution of the state (e.g., to compute probability that the\nhospital beds will reach a fill level, or that a specified percentage of the\npopulation will die). If the control policy is not given, it is possible to\napply POMDP techniques to identify an optimal control policy that fulfils some\nspecified probabilistic goals.

The high quantity of mobile\nusers, both consuming and producing these services to and from the Cloud\nComputing (CC), can outpace the available bandwidth capacity. Fog Computing\n(FG) presents itself as a solution to improve on this and other issues. With a\nreduction in network latency, real-time applications benefit from improved\nresponse time and greater overall user experience. Taking this into account,\nthe main goal of this work is threefold. Firstly, it is proposed a method to\nbuild an environment based on Cloud-Fog Computing (CFC). Secondly, it is\ndesigned two models based on Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)\nand Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The goal is to predict demand and reserve\nthe nodes' storage capacity to improve the positioning of multimedia services.\nLater, an algorithm for the multimedia service placement problem which is aware\nof data traffic prediction is proposed. The goal is to select the minimum\nnumber of nodes, considering their hardware capacities for providing multimedia\nservices in such a way that the latency for servicing all the demands is\nminimized. An evaluation with actual data showed that the proposed algorithm\nselects the nodes closer to the user to meet their demands.

The key of our system is a surface-based layered representation\nderiving from video decomposition, where the scene is decoupled into a surface\nfluid layer and an impervious background layer with corresponding\ntransparencies to characterize the composition of the two layers. The animated\nvideo can be produced by warping only the surface fluid layer according to the\nestimation of fluid motions and recombining it with the background. In\naddition, we introduce surface-only fluid simulation, a $2.5D$ fluid\ncalculation version, as a replacement for motion estimation. Specifically, we\nleverage the triangular mesh based on a monocular depth estimator to represent\nthe fluid surface layer and simulate the motion in the physics-based framework\nwith the inspiration of the classic theory of the hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian\nmethod, along with a learnable network so as to adapt to complex real-world\nimage textures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system through\ncomparison with existing methods in both standard objective metrics and\nsubjective ranking scores. Extensive experiments not only indicate our method's\ncompetitive performance for common fluid scenes but also better robustness and\nreasonability under complex transparent fluid scenarios.

To unveil the\neffectiveness of GCNs for recommendation, we first analyze them in a spectral\nperspective and discover two important findings: (1) only a small portion of\nspectral graph features that emphasize the neighborhood smoothness and\ndifference contribute to the recommendation accuracy, whereas most graph\ninformation can be considered as noise that even reduces the performance, and\n(2) repetition of the neighborhood aggregation emphasizes smoothed features and\nfilters out noise information in an ineffective way. Based on the two findings\nabove, we propose a new GCN learning scheme for recommendation by replacing\nneihgborhood aggregation with a simple yet effective Graph Denoising Encoder\n(GDE), which acts as a band pass filter to capture important graph features. We\nshow that our proposed method alleviates the over-smoothing and is comparable\nto an indefinite-layer GCN that can take any-hop neighborhood into\nconsideration. Finally, we dynamically adjust the gradients over the negative\nsamples to expedite model training without introducing additional complexity.\nExtensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that our proposed method\nnot only outperforms state-of-the-arts but also achieves 12x speedup over\nLightGCN.",

We build on a\nrecently proposed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) mechanism with a\nGraph Neural Network (GNN) communication layer.

Communicating environmental features and partially\nobservable fire occurrence help the agent collective to pre-emptively\ndistribute resources. Furthermore, we introduce a procedural training\nenvironment accommodating auto-curricula and open-endedness towards better\ngeneralizability. Our MA communication proposal outperforms a Greedy Heuristic\nBaseline and a Single-Agent (SA) setup.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the interpretation of why a machine learning (ML) model makes\ncertain inferences is as crucial as the accuracy of such inferences. Some ML\nmodels like the decision tree possess inherent interpretability that can be\ndirectly comprehended by humans. Others like artificial neural networks (ANN),\nhowever, rely on external methods to uncover the deduction mechanism. SHapley\nAdditive exPlanations (SHAP) is one of such external methods, which requires a\nbackground dataset when interpreting ANNs. Generally, a background dataset\nconsists of instances randomly sampled from the training dataset. However, the\nsampling size and its effect on SHAP remain to be unexplored. In our empirical\nstudy on the MIMIC-III dataset, we show that the two core explanations - SHAP\nvalues and variable rankings fluctuate when using different background datasets\nacquired from random sampling, indicating that users cannot unquestioningly\ntrust the one-shot interpretation from SHAP. Luckily, such fluctuation\ndecreases with the increase of the background dataset size. Also, we notice an\nU-shape in the stability assessment of SHAP variable rankings, demonstrating\nthat SHAP is more reliable in ranking the most and least important variables\ncompared to moderately important ones. Overall, our results suggest that users\nshould take into account how background data affects SHAP results, with\nimproved SHAP stability as the background sample size increases.",

    "abstract": "Secure aggregation, which is a core component of federated learning,\naggregates locally trained models from distributed users at a central server.\nThe \"secure\" nature of such aggregation consists of the fact that no\ninformation about the local users' data must be leaked to the server except the\naggregated local models. In order to guarantee security, some keys may be\nshared among the users (this is referred to as the key sharing phase). After\nthe key sharing phase, each user masks its trained model which is then sent to\nthe server (this is referred to as the model aggregation phase). This paper\nfollows the information theoretic secure aggregation problem originally\nformulated by Zhao and Sun, with the objective to characterize the minimum\ncommunication cost from the $K$ users in the model aggregation phase. Due to\nuser dropouts, the server may not receive all messages from the users. A secure\naggregation schemes should tolerate the dropouts of at most $K-U$ users, where\n$U$ is a system parameter. The optimal communication cost is characterized by\nZhao and Sun, but with the assumption that the keys stored by the users could\nbe any random variables with arbitrary dependency. On the motivation that\nuncoded groupwise keys are more convenient to be shared and could be used in\nlarge range of applications besides federated learning, in this paper we add\none constraint into the above problem, that the key variables are mutually\nindependent and each key is shared by a group of at most $S$ users, where $S$\nis another system parameter. To the best of our knowledge, all existing secure\naggregation schemes assign coded keys to the users. We show that if $S > K -\nU$, a new secure aggregation scheme with uncoded groupwise keys can achieve the\nsame optimal communication cost as the best scheme with coded keys; if $S \\leq\nK - U$, uncoded groupwise key sharing is strictly sub-optimal.",

    "abstract": "The extreme learning machine (ELM) method can yield highly accurate solutions\nto linear/nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), but requires the\nlast hidden layer of the neural network to be wide to achieve a high accuracy.\nIf the last hidden layer is narrow, the accuracy of the existing ELM method\nwill be poor, irrespective of the rest of the network configuration. In this\npaper we present a modified ELM method, termed HLConcELM (hidden-layer\nconcatenated ELM), to overcome the above drawback of the conventional ELM\nmethod. The HLConcELM method can produce highly accurate solutions to\nlinear/nonlinear PDEs when the last hidden layer of the network is narrow and\nwhen it is wide. The new method is based on a type of modified feedforward\nneural networks (FNN), termed HLConcFNN (hidden-layer concatenated FNN), which\nincorporates a logical concatenation of the hidden layers in the network and\nexposes all the hidden nodes to the output-layer nodes. We show that HLConcFNNs\nhave the remarkable property that, given a network architecture, when\nadditional hidden layers are appended to the network or when extra nodes are\nadded to the existing hidden layers, the approximation capacity of the\nHLConcFNN associated with the new architecture is guaranteed to be not smaller\nthan that of the original network architecture. We present ample benchmark\ntests with linear/nonlinear PDEs to demonstrate the computational accuracy and\nperformance of the HLConcELM method and the superiority of this method to the\nconventional ELM from previous works.",

This phenomena is\nknown as relative hypoglycemia or pseudo-hypoglycemia (PHG) and it is different\nfrom patient to patient. In this paper, we propose a model free strategy to\ncalculate insulin doses for T2D which mitigates PHG. The strategy makes use of\na feedback rating mechanism obtained from the subjects. The proposed strategy\ntunes the parameters of a proposed control law by using an online stochastic\noptimization approach for a defined cost function.

    "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition systems have high prediction latency because of\nthe high computational requirements for deep learning models and low\ngeneralizability mainly because of the poor reliability of emotional\nmeasurements across multiple corpora. To solve these problems, we present a\nspeech emotion recognition system based on a reductionist approach of\ndecomposing and analyzing syllable-level features. Mel-spectrogram of an audio\nstream is decomposed into syllable-level components, which are then analyzed to\nextract statistical features. The proposed method uses formant attention,\nnoise-gate filtering, and rolling normalization contexts to increase feature\nprocessing speed and tolerance to adversity. A set of syllable-level formant\nfeatures is extracted and fed into a single hidden layer neural network that\nmakes predictions for each syllable as opposed to the conventional approach of\nusing a sophisticated deep learner to make sentence-wide predictions. The\nsyllable level predictions help to achieve the real-time latency and lower the\naggregated error in utterance level cross-corpus predictions. The experiments\non IEMOCAP (IE), MSP-Improv (MI), and RAVDESS (RA) databases show that the\nmethod archives real-time latency while predicting with state-of-the-art\ncross-corpus unweighted accuracy of 47.6% for IE to MI and 56.2% for MI to IE.",

    "abstract": "Over parameterization is a common technique in deep learning to help models\nlearn and generalize sufficiently to the given task; nonetheless, this often\nleads to enormous network structures and consumes considerable computing\nresources during training. Recent powerful transformer-based deep learning\nmodels on vision tasks usually have heavy parameters and bear training\ndifficulty. However, many dense-prediction low-level computer vision tasks,\nsuch as rain streak removing, often need to be executed on devices with limited\ncomputing power and memory in practice. Hence, we introduce a recursive local\nwindow-based self-attention structure with residual connections and propose\nderaining a recursive transformer (DRT), which enjoys the superiority of the\ntransformer but requires a small amount of computing resources. In particular,\nthrough recursive architecture, our proposed model uses only 1.3% of the number\nof parameters of the current best performing model in deraining while exceeding\nthe state-of-the-art methods on the Rain100L benchmark by at least 0.33 dB.\nAblation studies also investigate the impact of recursions on derain outcomes.\nMoreover, since the model contains no deliberate design for deraining, it can\nalso be applied to other image restoration tasks. Our experiment shows that it\ncan achieve competitive results on desnowing. The source code and pretrained\nmodel can be found at https://github.com/YC-Liang/DRT.",

These\nlimitations result in that they cannot well adapt to the irregularity of object\nshape and uncertainty of motion, which may lead to irrelevant reference pixels\nused for interpolation. In order to solve this problem, we revisit the\ndeformable convolution for video interpolation, which can break the fixed grid\nrestrictions on the kernel region, making the distribution of reference points\nmore suitable for the shape of the object, and thus warp a more accurate\ninterpolation frame.

    "abstract": "Self-driving vehicles have their own intelligence to drive on open roads.\nHowever, vehicle managers, e.g., government or industrial companies, still need\na way to tell these self-driving vehicles what behaviors are encouraged or\nforbidden. Unlike human drivers, current self-driving vehicles cannot\nunderstand the traffic laws, thus rely on the programmers manually writing the\ncorresponding principles into the driving systems. It would be less efficient\nand hard to adapt some temporary traffic laws, especially when the vehicles use\ndata-driven decision-making algorithms. Besides, current self-driving vehicle\nsystems rarely take traffic law modification into consideration. This work aims\nto design a road traffic law adaptive decision-making method. The\ndecision-making algorithm is designed based on reinforcement learning, in which\nthe traffic rules are usually implicitly coded in deep neural networks. The\nmain idea is to supply the adaptability to traffic laws of self-driving\nvehicles by a law-adaptive backup policy. In this work, the natural\nlanguage-based traffic laws are first translated into a logical expression by\nthe Linear Temporal Logic method. Then, the system will try to monitor in\nadvance whether the self-driving vehicle may break the traffic laws by\ndesigning a long-term RL action space. Finally, a sample-based planning method\nwill re-plan the trajectory when the vehicle may break the traffic rules. The\nmethod is validated in a Beijing Winter Olympic Lane scenario and an overtaking\ncase, built in CARLA simulator. The results show that by adopting this method,\nthe self-driving vehicles can comply with new issued or updated traffic laws\neffectively.

    "title": "Reliability and Latency Analysis of Sliding Network Coding With  Re-Transmission",
    "abstract": "Future networks are expected to support various ultra-reliable low-latency\ncommunications via wireless links. To avoid the loss of packets and keep the\nlow latency, sliding network coding (SNC) is an emerging technology by\ngenerating redundant packets that are the linear combination of the original\ndata packets from the current block and some previous blocks. However, how to\ntake the advantage of re-transmission for SNC is still an open problem since\nhigher reliability could be achieved at the expense of large latency caused by\nround-trip time (RTT). To deal with this issue, in this paper, we consider the\nidea of adjusting the transmission phase and the number of the redundant\npackets for SNC with re-transmission. Specifically, If RTT is large, most of\nthe redundant packets are sent at the first transmission, otherwise,\nre-transmission will be used. We first derive a concise and tight lower bound\nof the block error probability of SNC without re-transmission. Then, based on\nthe bound, the theoretical expressions of the proposed re-transmission schemes\nare derived regarding the block error probability, the average code length, and\nthe average packet latency. Results show that the proposed SNC with\nre-transmission improves block error probability and keeps the low latency.",

    "abstract": "Recently, audio-visual scene classification (AVSC) has attracted increasing\nattention from multidisciplinary communities. Previous studies tended to adopt\na pipeline training strategy, which uses well-trained visual and acoustic\nencoders to extract high-level representations (embeddings) first, then\nutilizes them to train the audio-visual classifier. In this way, the extracted\nembeddings are well suited for uni-modal classifiers, but not necessarily\nsuited for multi-modal ones. In this paper, we propose a joint training\nframework, using the acoustic features and raw images directly as inputs for\nthe AVSC task. Specifically, we retrieve the bottom layers of pre-trained image\nmodels as visual encoder, and jointly optimize the scene classifier and 1D-CNN\nbased acoustic encoder during training. We evaluate the approach on the\ndevelopment dataset of TAU Urban Audio-Visual Scenes 2021. The experimental\nresults show that our proposed approach achieves significant improvement over\nthe conventional pipeline training strategy.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised semantic segmentation aims to discover groupings within and\nacross images that capture object and view-invariance of a category without\nexternal supervision. Grouping naturally has levels of granularity, creating\nambiguity in unsupervised segmentation. Existing methods avoid this ambiguity\nand treat it as a factor outside modeling, whereas we embrace it and desire\nhierarchical grouping consistency for unsupervised segmentation.\nWe approach unsupervised segmentation as a pixel-wise feature learning\nproblem. Our idea is that a good representation shall reveal not just a\nparticular level of grouping, but any level of grouping in a consistent and\npredictable manner. We enforce spatial consistency of grouping and bootstrap\nfeature learning with co-segmentation among multiple views of the same image,\nand enforce semantic consistency across the grouping hierarchy with clustering\ntransformers between coarse- and fine-grained features.\nWe deliver the first data-driven unsupervised hierarchical semantic\nsegmentation method called Hierarchical Segment Grouping (HSG). Capturing\nvisual similarity and statistical co-occurrences, HSG also outperforms existing\nunsupervised segmentation methods by a large margin on five major object- and\nscene-centric benchmarks.

    "abstract": "We explore the potential of CNN-based models for gallbladder cancer (GBC)\ndetection from ultrasound (USG) images as no prior study is known. USG is the\nmost common diagnostic modality for GB diseases due to its low cost and\naccessibility. However, USG images are challenging to analyze due to low image\nquality, noise, and varying viewpoints due to the handheld nature of the\nsensor. Our exhaustive study of state-of-the-art (SOTA) image classification\ntechniques for the problem reveals that they often fail to learn the salient GB\nregion due to the presence of shadows in the USG images. SOTA object detection\ntechniques also achieve low accuracy because of spurious textures due to noise\nor adjacent organs. We propose GBCNet to tackle the challenges in our problem.\nGBCNet first extracts the regions of interest (ROIs) by detecting the GB (and\nnot the cancer), and then uses a new multi-scale, second-order pooling\narchitecture specializing in classifying GBC. To effectively handle spurious\ntextures, we propose a curriculum inspired by human visual acuity, which\nreduces the texture biases in GBCNet. Experimental results demonstrate that\nGBCNet significantly outperforms SOTA CNN models, as well as the expert\nradiologists. Our technical innovations are generic to other USG image analysis\ntasks as well. Hence, as a validation, we also show the efficacy of GBCNet in\ndetecting breast cancer from USG images.

We first investigate the distribution\nof training and test data on popular retrieval benchmarks and identify a\nconsiderable overlap in query entities, query intent, and relevance labels.\nThis finding implies that the performance on these test sets is biased towards\ninterpolation and cannot accurately reflect the extrapolation capacity.\nTherefore, to evaluate the extrapolation performance of DR models, we propose\ntwo resampling strategies for existing retrieval benchmarks and comprehensively\ninvestigate how DR models perform. Results show that DR models may interpolate\nas well as complex interaction-based models (e.g., BERT and ColBERT) but\nextrapolate substantially worse. Among various DR training strategies,\ntext-encoding pretraining and target-domain pretraining are particularly\neffective for improving the extrapolation capacity. Finally, we compare the\nextrapolation capacity with domain transfer ability. Despite its simplicity and\nease of use, the extrapolation performance can reflect the domain transfer\nability in some domains of the BEIR dataset, further highlighting the\nfeasibility of our approaches in evaluating the generalizability of DR models.",

Although\nstate-of-the-art methods improve the performance of SISR on several datasets,\ndirect application of these networks for practical use is still an issue due to\nheavy computational load. For this purpose, recently, researchers have focused\non more efficient and high-performing network structures. Information\nmulti-distilling network (IMDN) is one of the highly efficient SISR networks\nwith high performance and low computational load. IMDN achieves this efficiency\nwith various mechanisms such as Intermediate Information Collection (IIC),\nworking in a global setting, Progressive Refinement Module (PRM), and Contrast\nAware Channel Attention (CCA), employed in a local setting. These mechanisms,\nhowever, do not equally contribute to the efficiency and performance of IMDN.\nIn this work, we propose the Global Progressive Refinement Module (GPRM) as a\nless parameter-demanding alternative to the IIC module for feature aggregation.\nTo further decrease the number of parameters and floating point operations\npersecond (FLOPS), we also propose Grouped Information Distilling Blocks\n(GIDB). Using the proposed structures, we design an efficient SISR network\ncalled IMDeception. Experiments reveal that the proposed network performs on\npar with state-of-the-art models despite having a limited number of parameters\nand FLOPS. Furthermore, using grouped convolutions as a building block of GIDB\nincreases room for further optimization during deployment. To show its\npotential, the proposed model was deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Xavier AGX and it\nhas been shown that it can run in real-time on this edge device",

Experimental results on the MultiWOZ dataset\ndemonstrate that our fully supervised learning-based method achieves a solid\ntask success rate of 90.6%, improving 3% compared to the state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Efficient air quality sensing serves as one of the essential services\nprovided in any recent smart city. Mostly facilitated by sparsely deployed Air\nQuality Monitoring Stations (AQMSs) that are difficult to install and maintain,\nthe overall spatial variation heavily impacts air quality monitoring for\nlocations far enough from these pre-deployed public infrastructures. To\nmitigate this, we in this paper propose a framework named AQuaMoHo that can\nannotate data obtained from a low-cost thermo-hygrometer (as the sole physical\nsensing device) with the AQI labels, with the help of additional publicly\ncrawled Spatio-temporal information of that locality. At its core, AQuaMoHo\nexploits the temporal patterns from a set of readily available spatial features\nusing an LSTM-based model and further enhances the overall quality of the\nannotation using temporal attention. From a thorough study of two different\ncities, we observe that AQuaMoHo can significantly help annotate the air\nquality data on a personal scale.",

    "abstract": "Graph product structure theory expresses certain graphs as subgraphs of the\nstrong product of much simpler graphs. In particular, an elegant formulation\nfor the corresponding structural theorems involves the strong product of a path\nand of a bounded treewidth graph, and allows to lift combinatorial results for\nbounded treewidth graphs to graph classes for which the product structure\nholds, such as to planar graphs [Dujmovi\\'c et al., J. ACM, 67(4), 22:1-38,\n2020].\nIn this paper, we join the search for extensions of this powerful tool beyond\nplanarity by considering the h-framed graphs, a graph class that includes\n1-planar, optimal 2-planar, and k-map graphs (for appropriate values of h). We\nestablish a graph product structure theorem for h-framed graphs stating that\nthe graphs in this class are subgraphs of the strong product of a path, of a\nplanar graph of treewidth at most 3, and of a clique of size $3\\lfloor h/2\n\\rfloor +\\lfloor h/3 \\rfloor -1$. This allows us to improve over the previous\nstructural theorems for 1-planar and k-map graphs. Our results constitute\nsignificant progress over the previous bounds on the queue number,\nnon-repetitive chromatic number, and p-centered chromatic number of these graph\nclasses, e.g., we lower the currently best upper bound on the queue number of\n1-planar graphs and k-map graphs from 495 to 81 and from 32225k(k-3) to 61k,\nrespectively. We also employ the product structure machinery to improve the\ncurrent upper bounds of twin-width of planar and 1-planar graphs from 183 to\n37, and from O(1) to 80, respectively.

    "abstract": "Digital watermarking has been widely studied for the protection of\nintellectual property. Traditional watermarking schemes often design in a\n\"wider\" rule, which applies one general embedding mechanism to all images. But\nthis will limit the scheme into a robustness-invisibility trade-off, where the\nimprovements of robustness can only be achieved by the increase of embedding\nintensity thus causing the visual quality decay. However, a new scenario comes\nout at this stage that many businesses wish to give high level protection to\nspecific valuable images, which requires high robustness and high visual\nquality at the same time. Such scenario makes the watermarking schemes should\nbe designed in a \"deeper\" way which makes the embedding mechanism customized to\nspecific images. To achieve so, we break the robustness-invisibility trade-off\nby introducing computation cost in, and propose a novel auto-decoder-like\nimage-specified watermarking framework (ISMark). Based on ISMark, the strong\nrobustness and high visual quality for specific images can be both achieved. In\ndetail, we apply an optimization procedure (OPT) to replace the traditional\nembedding mechanism. Unlike existing schemes that embed watermarks using a\nlearned encoder, OPT regards the cover image as the optimizable parameters to\nminimize the extraction error of the decoder, thus the features of each\nspecified image can be effectively exploited to achieve superior performance.\nExtensive experiments indicate that ISMark outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods by a large margin, which improves the average bit error rate by 4.64%\n(from 4.86% to 0.22%) and PSNR by 2.20dB (from 32.50dB to 34.70dB).",

Based on the semantic relationship between their label spaces, we\ncan bridge the support gap between output distributions by minimizing Sinkhorn\ndistances. The transportation cost also acts as a measurement of teachers'\nadaptability so that we can rank the teachers efficiently according to their\nrelatedness. Experiments under various settings demonstrate the succinctness\nand versatility of our method.",

In this paper, we evaluate three heuristics for\nselecting diverse problem instances which should be involved in the comparison\nof optimization algorithms in order to ensure robust statistical algorithm\nperformance analysis. The first approach employs clustering to identify similar\ngroups of problem instances and subsequent sampling from each cluster to\nconstruct new benchmarks, while the other two approaches use graph algorithms\nfor identifying dominating and maximal independent sets of nodes. We\ndemonstrate the applicability of the proposed heuristics by performing a\nstatistical performance analysis of five portfolios consisting of three\noptimization algorithms on five of the most commonly used optimization\nbenchmarks. The results indicate that the statistical analyses of the\nalgorithms' performance, conducted on each benchmark separately, produce\nconflicting outcomes, which can be used to give a false indication of the\nsuperiority of one algorithm over another. On the other hand, when the analysis\nis conducted on the problem instances selected with the proposed heuristics,\nwhich uniformly cover the problem landscape, the statistical outcomes are\nrobust and consistent.",

Data\naugmentation has been the major approach in improving the robustness against\ncommon corruptions. However, the samples produced by popular augmentation\nstrategies deviate significantly from the underlying data manifold. As a\nresult, performance is skewed toward certain types of corruption. To address\nthis issue, we propose a multi-source vicinal transfer augmentation (VITA)\nmethod for generating diverse on-manifold samples. The proposed VITA consists\nof two complementary parts: tangent transfer and integration of multi-source\nvicinal samples. The tangent transfer creates initial augmented samples for\nimproving corruption robustness.

For this purpose, humans intuitively use visual cues,\nsuch as light cones and light reflections emitted by other road users to be\nable to react to oncoming traffic at an early stage. This behavior can be\nimitated by computer vision methods by predicting the appearance of vehicles\nbased on emitted light reflections caused by the vehicle's headlights. Since\ncurrent object detection algorithms are mainly based on detecting directly\nvisible objects annotated via bounding boxes, the detection and annotation of\nlight reflections without sharp boundaries is challenging. For this reason, the\nextensive open-source dataset PVDN (Provident Vehicle Detection at Night) was\npublished, which includes traffic scenarios at night with light reflections\nannotated via keypoints. In this paper, we explore the potential of\nsaliency-based approaches to create different object representations based on\nthe visual saliency and sparse keypoint annotations of the PVDN dataset. For\nthat, we extend the general idea of Boolean map saliency towards a\ncontext-aware approach by taking into consideration sparse keypoint annotations\nby humans. We show that this approach allows for an automated derivation of\ndifferent object representations, such as binary maps or bounding boxes so that\ndetection models can be trained on different annotation variants and the\nproblem of providently detecting vehicles at night can be tackled from\ndifferent perspectives. With that, we provide further powerful tools and\nmethods to study the problem of detecting vehicles at night before they are\nactually visible.",

    "abstract": "Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) has proven to be an effective query\nreformulation technique to improve retrieval accuracy. It aims to alleviate the\nmismatch of linguistic expressions between a query and its potential relevant\ndocuments. Existing PRF methods independently treat revised queries originating\nfrom the same query but using different numbers of feedback documents,\nresulting in severe query drift. Without comparing the effects of two different\nrevisions from the same query, a PRF model may incorrectly focus on the\nadditional irrelevant information increased in the more feedback, and thus\nreformulate a query that is less effective than the revision using the less\nfeedback. Ideally, if a PRF model can distinguish between irrelevant and\nrelevant information in the feedback, the more feedback documents there are,\nthe better the revised query will be. To bridge this gap, we propose the\nLoss-over-Loss (LoL) framework to compare the reformulation losses between\ndifferent revisions of the same query during training. Concretely, we revise an\noriginal query multiple times in parallel using different amounts of feedback\nand compute their reformulation losses. Then, we introduce an additional\nregularization loss on these reformulation losses to penalize revisions that\nuse more feedback but gain larger losses. With such comparative regularization,\nthe PRF model is expected to learn to suppress the extra increased irrelevant\ninformation by comparing the effects of different revised queries. Further, we\npresent a differentiable query reformulation method to implement this\nframework. This method revises queries in the vector space and directly\noptimizes the retrieval performance of query vectors, applicable for both\nsparse and dense retrieval models.

In the\ntraining process of recommender systems, the loss function plays an essential\nrole in guiding the optimization of recommendation models to generate accurate\nsuggestions for users. However, most existing sequential recommendation\ntechniques focus on designing algorithms or neural network architectures, and\nfew efforts have been made to tailor loss functions that fit naturally into the\npractical application scenario of sequential recommender systems.\nRanking-based losses, such as cross-entropy and Bayesian Personalized Ranking\n(BPR) are widely used in the sequential recommendation area.

We therefore propose two new loss functions\nbased on the Determinantal Point Process (DPP) likelihood, that can be\nadaptively applied to estimate the subsequent item or items.

    "abstract": "The electrification of transport is seen as an important step in the global\ndecarbonisation agenda. With such a large expected load on the power system\nfrom electric vehicles (EVs), it is important to coordinate charging in order\nto balance the supply and demand for electricity. Bidirectional charging,\nenabled through Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology, will unlock significant\nstorage capacity from stationary EVs that are plugged in. To take this concept\na step further, this paper quantifies the potential revenues to be gained by a\ncommercial EV fleet operator from simultaneously scheduling its trips on a\nday-ahead basis, as well as its charging. This allows the fleet to complete its\ntrips (with user defined trip length and distance), while taking advantage of\nfluctuating energy and ancillary services prices. A mathematical framework for\noptimal trip scheduling is proposed, formulated as a mixed-integer linear\nprogram, and is applied to several relevant scenarios of the present and future\nBritish electricity system. It is demonstrated that an optimal journey start\ntime can increase the revenue of commercial fleets by up to 38% in summer and\n12% in winter. This means a single EV from the maintenance fleet can make\nadditional annual revenue of up to {\\pounds}729. Flexible trip schedules are\nmore valuable in the summer because keeping EVs plugged in during peak solar\noutput will benefit the grid and the fleet operators the most. It was also\nfound that a fleet of 5,000 EVs would result in the equivalent $\\textrm{CO}_2$\nof removing one Combined Cycle Gas Turbine from the system. This significant\nincrease in revenue and carbon savings show this approach is worth\ninvestigating for potential future application.",

    "title": "Deep CSI Compression for Massive MIMO: A Self-information Model-driven  Neural Network",
    "abstract": "In order to fully exploit the advantages of massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (mMIMO), it is critical for the transmitter to accurately\nacquire the channel state information (CSI). Deep learning (DL)-based methods\nhave been proposed for CSI compression and feedback to the transmitter.\nAlthough most existing DL-based methods consider the CSI matrix as an image,\nstructural features of the CSI image are rarely exploited in neural network\ndesign. As such, we propose a model of self-information that dynamically\nmeasures the amount of information contained in each patch of a CSI image from\nthe perspective of structural features. Then, by applying the self-information\nmodel, we propose a model-and-data-driven network for CSI compression and\nfeedback, namely IdasNet. The IdasNet includes the design of a module of\nself-information deletion and selection (IDAS), an encoder of informative\nfeature compression (IFC), and a decoder of informative feature recovery (IFR).\nIn particular, the model-driven module of IDAS pre-compresses the CSI image by\nremoving informative redundancy in terms of the self-information. The encoder\nof IFC then conducts feature compression to the pre-compressed CSI image and\ngenerates a feature codeword which contains two components, i.e., codeword\nvalues and position indices of the codeword values. Subsequently, the IFR\ndecoder decouples the codeword values as well as position indices to recover\nthe CSI image. Experimental results verify that the proposed IdasNet noticeably\noutperforms existing DL-based networks under various compression ratios while\nit has the number of network parameters reduced by orders-of-magnitude compared\nwith various existing methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing task,\nwhich aims to recognize all events belonging to each modality and localize\ntheir temporal boundaries. This task is challenging because only overall labels\nindicating the video events are provided for training. However, an event might\nbe labeled but not appear in one of the modalities, which results in a\nmodality-specific noisy label problem. Motivated by two observations that\nnetworks tend to learn clean samples first and that a labeled event would\nappear in at least one modality, we propose a training strategy to identify and\nremove modality-specific noisy labels dynamically. Specifically, we sort the\nlosses of all instances within a mini-batch individually in each modality, then\nselect noisy samples according to relationships between intra-modal and\ninter-modal losses. Besides, we also propose a simple but valid noise ratio\nestimation method by calculating the proportion of instances whose confidence\nis below a preset threshold.

    "abstract": "3D object detection from multiple image views is a fundamental and\nchallenging task for visual scene understanding. Due to its low cost and high\nefficiency, multi-view 3D object detection has demonstrated promising\napplication prospects. However, accurately detecting objects through\nperspective views in the 3D space is extremely difficult due to the lack of\ndepth information. Recently, DETR3D introduces a novel 3D-2D query paradigm in\naggregating multi-view images for 3D object detection and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance. In this paper, with intensive pilot experiments,\nwe quantify the objects located at different regions and find that the\n\"truncated instances\" (i.e., at the border regions of each image) are the main\nbottleneck hindering the performance of DETR3D. Although it merges multiple\nfeatures from two adjacent views in the overlapping regions, DETR3D still\nsuffers from insufficient feature aggregation, thus missing the chance to fully\nboost the detection performance. In an effort to tackle the problem, we propose\nGraph-DETR3D to automatically aggregate multi-view imagery information through\ngraph structure learning (GSL). It constructs a dynamic 3D graph between each\nobject query and 2D feature maps to enhance the object representations,\nespecially at the border regions. Besides, Graph-DETR3D benefits from a novel\ndepth-invariant multi-scale training strategy, which maintains the visual depth\nconsistency by simultaneously scaling the image size and the object depth.\nExtensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of our Graph-DETR3D. Notably, our best model achieves 49.5 NDS on\nthe nuScenes test leaderboard, achieving new state-of-the-art in comparison\nwith various published image-view 3D object detectors.",

Such\noperational support for ineffective ads has been less explored than that for\neffective ads. After pre-analyzing 1,000,000 real-world ad creatives, we found\nthat there are two types of discontinuation: short-term (i.e., cut-out) and\nlong-term (i.e., wear-out). In this paper, we propose a practical prediction\nframework for the discontinuation of ad creatives with a hazard function-based\nloss function inspired by survival analysis. Our framework predicts the\ndiscontinuations with a multi-modal deep neural network that takes as input the\nad creative (e.g., text, categorical, image, numerical features). To improve\nthe prediction performance for the two different types of discontinuations and\nfor the ad creatives that contribute to sales, we introduce two new techniques:\n(1) a two-term estimation technique with multi-task learning and (2) a\nclick-through rate-weighting technique for the loss function.

    "abstract": "Recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been widely introduced into\nCollaborative Filtering (CF) to produce more accurate recommendation results\ndue to their capability of capturing the complex nonlinear relationships\nbetween items and users.However, the DNNs-based models usually suffer from high\ncomputational complexity, i.e., consuming very long training time and storing\nhuge amount of trainable parameters. To address these problems, we propose a\nnew broad recommender system called Broad Collaborative Filtering (BroadCF),\nwhich is an efficient nonlinear collaborative filtering approach. Instead of\nDNNs, Broad Learning System (BLS) is used as a mapping function to learn the\ncomplex nonlinear relationships between users and items, which can avoid the\nabove issues while achieving very satisfactory recommendation performance.\nHowever, it is not feasible to directly feed the original rating data into BLS.\nTo this end, we propose a user-item rating collaborative vector preprocessing\nprocedure to generate low-dimensional user-item input data, which is able to\nharness quality judgments of the most similar users/items. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets have confirmed the\neffectiveness of the proposed BroadCF algorithm",

    "abstract": "Civilian-GNSS is vulnerable to signal spoofing attacks, and countermeasures\nbased on cryptographic authentication are being proposed to protect against\nthese attacks. Both Galileo and GPS are currently testing broadcast\nauthentication techniques based on the delayed key disclosure to validate the\nintegrity of navigation messages. These authentication mechanisms have proven\nsecure against record now and replay later attacks, as navigation messages\nbecome invalid after keys are released. This work analyzes the security\nguarantees of cryptographically protected GNSS signals and shows the\npossibility of spoofing a receiver to an arbitrary location without breaking\nany cryptographic operation. In contrast to prior work, we demonstrate the\nability of an attacker to receive signals close to the victim receiver and\ngenerate spoofing signals for a different target location without modifying the\nnavigation message contents. Our strategy exploits the essential common\nreception and transmission time method used to estimate pseudorange in GNSS\nreceivers, thereby rendering any cryptographic authentication useless. We\nevaluate our attack on a commercial receiver (ublox M9N) and a software-defined\nGNSS receiver (GNSS-SDR) using a combination of open-source tools, commercial\nGNSS signal generators, and software-defined radio hardware platforms. Our\nresults show that it is possible to spoof a victim receiver to locations around\n4000 km away from the true location without requiring any high-speed\ncommunication networks or modifying the message contents.

    "abstract": "This work presents a novel interpolation-free mesh adaptation technique for\nthe Euler equations within the arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian framework. For the\nspatial discretization, we consider a residual distribution scheme, which\nprovides a pretty simple way to achieve high order accuracy on unstructured\ngrids. Thanks to a special interpretation of the mesh connectivity changes as a\nseries of fictitious continuous deformations, we can enforce by construction\nthe so-called geometric conservation law, which helps to avoid spurious\noscillations while solving the governing equations over dynamic domains. This\nstrategy preserves the numerical properties of the underlying,\nfixed-connectivity scheme, such as conservativeness and stability, as it avoids\nan explicit interpolation of the solution between different grids. The proposed\napproach is validated through the two-dimensional simulations of steady and\nunsteady flow problems over unstructured grids.",

Specifically,\nMaxSP$_k$ denotes the class of $O(m^k)$-time problems of the form\n$\\max_{x_1,\\dots, x_k} \\#\\{y:\\phi(x_1,\\dots,x_k,y)\\}$ where $\\phi$ is a\nquantifier-free first-order property and $m$ denotes the size of the relational\nstructure. Assuming central hypotheses about clique detection in hypergraphs\nand MAX3SAT, we show that for any MaxSP$_k$ problem definable by a\nquantifier-free $m$-edge graph formula $\\phi$, the best possible approximation\nguarantee in faster-than-exhaustive-search time $O(m^{k-\\delta})$ falls into\none of four categories:\n* optimizable to exactness in time $O(m^{k-\\delta})$,\n* an (inefficient) approximation scheme, i.e., a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation\nin time $O(m^{k-f(\\epsilon)})$,\n* a (fixed) constant-factor approximation in time $O(m^{k-\\delta})$, or\n* an $m^\\epsilon$-approximation in time $O(m^{k-f(\\epsilon)})$.\nWe obtain an almost complete characterization of these regimes, for MaxSP$_k$\nas well as for an analogously defined minimization class MinSP$_k$. As our main\ntechnical contribution, we rule out approximation schemes for a large class of\nproblems admitting constant-factor approximations, under the Sparse MAX3SAT\nhypothesis posed by (Alman, Vassilevska Williams'20). As general trends for the\nproblems we consider, we find: (1) Exact optimizability has a simple algebraic\ncharacterization, (2) only few maximization problems do not admit a\nconstant-factor approximation; these do not even have a subpolynomial-factor\napproximation, and (3) constant-factor approximation of minimization problems\nis equivalent to deciding whether the optimum is equal to 0.",

Anchor-free methods have made remarkable progress which\nmainly formulate TAD into two tasks: classification and localization using two\nseparate branches. This paper reveals the temporal misalignment between the two\ntasks hindering further progress. To address this, we propose a new method that\ngives insights into moment and region perspectives simultaneously to align the\ntwo tasks by acquiring reliable proposal quality. For the moment perspective,\nBoundary Evaluate Module (BEM) is designed which focuses on local appearance\nand motion evolvement to estimate boundary quality and adopts a multi-scale\nmanner to deal with varied action durations. For the region perspective, we\nintroduce Region Evaluate Module (REM) which uses a new and efficient sampling\nmethod for proposal feature representation containing more contextual\ninformation compared with point feature to refine category score and proposal\nboundary. The proposed Boundary Evaluate Module and Region Evaluate Module\n(BREM) are generic, and they can be easily integrated with other anchor-free\nTAD methods to achieve superior performance. In our experiments, BREM is\ncombined with two different frameworks and improves the performance on THUMOS14\nby 3.6$\\%$ and 1.0$\\%$ respectively, reaching a new state-of-the-art (63.6$\\%$\naverage $m$AP).

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present Tac2Pose, an object-specific approach to tactile\npose estimation from the first touch for known objects. Given the object\ngeometry, we learn a tailored perception model in simulation that estimates a\nprobability distribution over possible object poses given a tactile\nobservation. To do so, we simulate the contact shapes that a dense set of\nobject poses would produce on the sensor. Then, given a new contact shape\nobtained from the sensor, we match it against the pre-computed set using an\nobject-specific embedding learned using contrastive learning. We obtain contact\nshapes from the sensor with an object-agnostic calibration step that maps RGB\ntactile observations to binary contact shapes. This mapping, which can be\nreused across object and sensor instances, is the only step trained with real\nsensor data. This results in a perception model that localizes objects from the\nfirst real tactile observation. Importantly, it produces pose distributions and\ncan incorporate additional pose constraints coming from other perception\nsystems, contacts, or priors.\nWe provide quantitative results for 20 objects. Tac2Pose provides high\naccuracy pose estimations from distinctive tactile observations while\nregressing meaningful pose distributions to account for those contact shapes\nthat could result from different object poses. We also test Tac2Pose on object\nmodels reconstructed from a 3D scanner, to evaluate the robustness to\nuncertainty in the object model. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of\nTac2Pose compared with three baseline methods for tactile pose estimation:\ndirectly regressing the object pose with a neural network, matching an observed\ncontact to a set of possible contacts using a standard classification neural\nnetwork, and direct pixel comparison of an observed contact with a set of\npossible contacts.\nWebsite: this http URL",

    "abstract": "In this paper, an online multiscale model reduction method is presented for\nstochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with multiplicative noise,\nwhere the diffusion coefficient is spatially multiscale and the noise\nperturbation nonlinearly depends on the diffusion dynamics. It is necessary to\nefficiently compute all possible trajectories of the stochastic dynamics for\nquantifying model's uncertainty and statistic moments. The multiscale diffusion\nand nonlinearity may cause the computation intractable. To overcome the\nmultiscale difficulty, a constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale\nfinite element method (CEM-GMsFEM) is used to localize the computation and\nobtain an effective coarse model. However, the nonlinear terms are still\ndefined on a fine scale space after the Galerkin projection of CEM-GMsFEM is\napplied to the nonlinear SPDEs. This significantly impacts on the simulation\nefficiency by CEM-GMsFEM. To this end, a stochastic online discrete empirical\ninterpolation method (DEIM) is proposed to treat the stochastic nonlinearity.\nThe stochastic online DEIM incorporates offline snapshots and online snapshots.\nThe offline snapshots consist of the nonlinear terms at the approximate mean of\nthe stochastic dynamics and are used to construct an offline reduced model. The\nonline snapshots contain some information of the current new trajectory and are\nused to correct the offline reduced model in an increment manner. The\nstochastic online DEIM substantially reduces the dimension of the nonlinear\ndynamics and enhances the prediction accuracy for the reduced model. Thus, the\nonline multiscale model reduction is constructed by using CEM-GMsFEM and the\nstochastic online DEIM. A priori error analysis is carried out for the\nnonlinear SPDEs.

    "title": "The Causal News Corpus: Annotating Causal Relations in Event Sentences  from News",
    "abstract": "Despite the importance of understanding causality, corpora addressing causal\nrelations are limited. There is a discrepancy between existing annotation\nguidelines of event causality and conventional causality corpora that focus\nmore on linguistics. Many guidelines restrict themselves to include only\nexplicit relations or clause-based arguments. Therefore, we propose an\nannotation schema for event causality that addresses these concerns. We\nannotated 3,559 event sentences from protest event news with labels on whether\nit contains causal relations or not. Our corpus is known as the Causal News\nCorpus (CNC). A neural network built upon a state-of-the-art pre-trained\nlanguage model performed well with 81.20% F1 score on test set, and 83.46% in\n5-folds cross-validation. CNC is transferable across two external corpora:\nCausalTimeBank (CTB) and Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB). Leveraging each of\nthese external datasets for training, we achieved up to approximately 64% F1 on\nthe CNC test set without additional fine-tuning. CNC also served as an\neffective training and pre-training dataset for the two external corpora.\nLastly, we demonstrate the difficulty of our task to the layman in a\ncrowd-sourced annotation exercise. Our annotated corpus is publicly available,\nproviding a valuable resource for causal text mining researchers.",

    "abstract": "Recently, masked image modeling (MIM) has gained considerable attention due\nto its capacity to learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data and has been\ndemonstrated to be effective on a wide variety of vision tasks involving\nnatural images. Meanwhile, the potential of self-supervised learning in\nmodeling 3D medical images is anticipated to be immense due to the high\nquantities of unlabeled images, and the expense and difficulty of quality\nlabels. However, MIM's applicability to medical images remains uncertain. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate that masked image modeling approaches can also\nadvance 3D medical images analysis in addition to natural images. We study how\nmasked image modeling strategies leverage performance from the viewpoints of 3D\nmedical image segmentation as a representative downstream task: i) when\ncompared to naive contrastive learning, masked image modeling approaches\naccelerate the convergence of supervised training even faster (1.40$\\times$)\nand ultimately produce a higher dice score; ii) predicting raw voxel values\nwith a high masking ratio and a relatively smaller patch size is non-trivial\nself-supervised pretext-task for medical images modeling; iii) a lightweight\ndecoder or projection head design for reconstruction is powerful for masked\nimage modeling on 3D medical images which speeds up training and reduce cost;\niv) finally, we also investigate the effectiveness of MIM methods under\ndifferent practical scenarios where different image resolutions and labeled\ndata ratios are applied.",

    "abstract": "Life and physical sciences have always been quick to adopt the latest\nadvances in machine learning to accelerate scientific discovery. Examples of\nthis are cell segmentation or cancer detection. Nevertheless, these exceptional\nresults are based on mining previously created datasets to discover patterns or\ntrends. Recent advances in AI have been demonstrated in real-time scenarios\nlike self-driving cars or playing video games. However, these new techniques\nhave not seen widespread adoption in life or physical sciences because\nexperimentation can be slow. To tackle this limitation, this work aims to adapt\ngenerative learning algorithms to model scientific experiments and accelerate\ntheir discovery using in-silico simulations. We particularly focused on\nreal-time experiments, aiming to model how they react to user inputs. To\nachieve this, here we present an encoder-decoder architecture based on the\nTransformer model to simulate real-time scientific experimentation, predict its\nfuture behaviour and manipulate it on a step-by-step basis. As a proof of\nconcept, this architecture was trained to map a set of mechanical inputs to the\noscillations generated by a chemical reaction. The model was paired with a\nReinforcement Learning controller to show how the simulated chemistry can be\nmanipulated in real-time towards user-defined behaviours. Our results\ndemonstrate how generative learning can model real-time scientific\nexperimentation to track how it changes through time as the user manipulates\nit, and how the trained models can be paired with optimisation algorithms to\ndiscover new phenomena beyond the physical limitations of lab experimentation.\nThis work paves the way towards building surrogate systems where physical\nexperimentation interacts with machine learning on a step-by-step basis.",

    "abstract": "With the development of the 3D data acquisition facilities, the increasing\nscale of acquired 3D point clouds poses a challenge to the existing data\ncompression techniques. Although promising performance has been achieved in\nstatic point cloud compression, it remains under-explored and challenging to\nleverage temporal correlations within a point cloud sequence for effective\ndynamic point cloud compression. In this paper, we study the attribute (e.g.,\ncolor) compression of dynamic point clouds and present a learning-based\nframework, termed 4DAC. To reduce temporal redundancy within data, we first\nbuild the 3D motion estimation and motion compensation modules with deep neural\nnetworks. Then, the attribute residuals produced by the motion compensation\ncomponent are encoded by the region adaptive hierarchical transform into\nresidual coefficients. In addition, we also propose a deep conditional entropy\nmodel to estimate the probability distribution of the transformed coefficients,\nby incorporating temporal context from consecutive point clouds and the motion\nestimation/compensation modules. Finally, the data stream is losslessly entropy\ncoded with the predicted distribution. Extensive experiments on several public\ndatasets demonstrate the superior compression performance of the proposed\napproach.",

    "abstract": "Predicting medications is a crucial task in many intelligent healthcare\nsystems. It can assist doctors in making informed medication decisions for\npatients according to electronic medical records (EMRs). However, medication\nprediction is a challenging data mining task due to the complex relations\nbetween medical codes. Most existing studies usually focus on mining the\ntemporal relations between medical codes while neglecting the valuable spatial\nrelations between heterogeneous or homogeneous medical codes, and the inherent\nrelations between homogeneous medical codes from hierarchical ontology graph,\nwhich further limits the prediction performance. Therefore, to address these\nlimitations, this paper proposes \\textbf{KnowAugNet}, a multi-sourced medical\nknowledge augmented medication prediction network which can fully capture the\ndiverse relations between medical codes via multi-level graph contrastive\nlearning framework. Specifically, KnowAugNet first leverages the graph\ncontrastive learning using graph attention network as the encoder to capture\nthe implicit relations between homogeneous medical codes from the medical\nontology graph and obtains the knowledge augmented medical codes embedding\nvectors. Then, it utilizes the graph contrastive learning using a weighted\ngraph convolutional network as the encoder to capture the correlative relations\nbetween homogeneous or heterogeneous medical codes from the constructed medical\nprior relation graph and obtains the relation augmented medical codes embedding\nvectors. Finally, the augmented medical codes embedding vectors and the\nsupervised medical codes embedding vectors are retrieved and input to the\nsequential learning network to capture the temporal relations of medical codes\nand predict medications for patients.",

We\ndevise a new approach named as Hardness-Aware Debiased Contrastive\nCollaborative Filtering (HDCCF) to resolve the dilemma.

Therefore, methods and techniques that are\nable to lift the efficiency bottleneck while preserving the high accuracy of\nDNNs are in great demand in order to enable numerous edge AI applications. This\npaper provides an overview of efficient deep learning methods, systems and\napplications. We start from introducing popular model compression methods,\nincluding pruning, factorization, quantization as well as compact model design.\nTo reduce the large design cost of these manual solutions, we discuss the\nAutoML framework for each of them, such as neural architecture search (NAS) and\nautomated pruning and quantization. We then cover efficient on-device training\nto enable user customization based on the local data on mobile devices. Apart\nfrom general acceleration techniques, we also showcase several task-specific\naccelerations for point cloud, video and natural language processing by\nexploiting their spatial sparsity and temporal/token redundancy. Finally, to\nsupport all these algorithmic advancements, we introduce the efficient deep\nlearning system design from both software and hardware perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Despite impressive performance in many benchmark datasets, AI models can\nstill make mistakes, especially among out-of-distribution examples. It remains\nan open question how such imperfect models can be used effectively in\ncollaboration with humans. Prior work has focused on AI assistance that helps\npeople make individual high-stakes decisions, which is not scalable for a large\namount of relatively low-stakes decisions, e.g., moderating social media\ncomments. Instead, we propose conditional delegation as an alternative paradigm\nfor human-AI collaboration where humans create rules to indicate trustworthy\nregions of a model. Using content moderation as a testbed, we develop novel\ninterfaces to assist humans in creating conditional delegation rules and\nconduct a randomized experiment with two datasets to simulate in-distribution\nand out-of-distribution scenarios. Our study demonstrates the promise of\nconditional delegation in improving model performance and provides insights\ninto design for this novel paradigm, including the effect of AI explanations.",

    "title": "Can Rationalization Improve Robustness?",
    "abstract": "A growing line of work has investigated the development of neural NLP models\nthat can produce rationales--subsets of input that can explain their model\npredictions. In this paper, we ask whether such rationale models can also\nprovide robustness to adversarial attacks in addition to their interpretable\nnature. Since these models need to first generate rationales (\"rationalizer\")\nbefore making predictions (\"predictor\"), they have the potential to ignore\nnoise or adversarially added text by simply masking it out of the generated\nrationale. To this end, we systematically generate various types of 'AddText'\nattacks for both token and sentence-level rationalization tasks, and perform an\nextensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art rationale models across five\ndifferent tasks. Our experiments reveal that the rationale models show the\npromise to improve robustness, while they struggle in certain scenarios--when\nthe rationalizer is sensitive to positional bias or lexical choices of attack\ntext. Further, leveraging human rationale as supervision does not always\ntranslate to better performance. Our study is a first step towards exploring\nthe interplay between interpretability and robustness in the\nrationalize-then-predict framework.",

    "abstract": "The recent progress in non-autoregressive text-to-speech (NAR-TTS) has made\nfast and high-quality speech synthesis possible. However, current NAR-TTS\nmodels usually use phoneme sequence as input and thus cannot understand the\ntree-structured syntactic information of the input sequence, which hurts the\nprosody modeling. To this end, we propose SyntaSpeech, a syntax-aware and\nlight-weight NAR-TTS model, which integrates tree-structured syntactic\ninformation into the prosody modeling modules in PortaSpeech\n\\cite{ren2021portaspeech}. Specifically, 1) We build a syntactic graph based on\nthe dependency tree of the input sentence, then process the text encoding with\na syntactic graph encoder to extract the syntactic information. 2) We\nincorporate the extracted syntactic encoding with PortaSpeech to improve the\nprosody prediction. 3) We introduce a multi-length discriminator to replace the\nflow-based post-net in PortaSpeech, which simplifies the training pipeline and\nimproves the inference speed, while keeping the naturalness of the generated\naudio. Experiments on three datasets not only show that the tree-structured\nsyntactic information grants SyntaSpeech the ability to synthesize better audio\nwith expressive prosody, but also demonstrate the generalization ability of\nSyntaSpeech to adapt to multiple languages and multi-speaker text-to-speech.\nAblation studies demonstrate the necessity of each component in SyntaSpeech.\nSource code and audio samples are available at https://syntaspeech.github.io",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a new online learning problem with doubly-streaming\ndata, where the data streams are described by feature spaces that constantly\nevolve, with new features emerging and old features fading away. The challenges\nof this problem are two folds: 1) Data samples ceaselessly flowing in may carry\nshifted patterns over time, requiring learners to update hence adapt\non-the-fly. 2) Newly emerging features are described by very few samples,\nresulting in weak learners that tend to make error predictions. A plausible\nidea to overcome the challenges is to establish relationship between the\npre-and-post evolving feature spaces, so that an online learner can leverage\nthe knowledge learned from the old features to better the learning performance\non the new features. Unfortunately, this idea does not scale up to\nhigh-dimensional media streams with complex feature interplay, which suffers an\ntradeoff between onlineness (biasing shallow learners) and\nexpressiveness(requiring deep learners). Motivated by this, we propose a novel\nOLD^3S paradigm, where a shared latent subspace is discovered to summarize\ninformation from the old and new feature spaces, building intermediate feature\nmapping relationship. A key trait of OLD^3S is to treat the model capacity as a\nlearnable semantics, yields optimal model depth and parameters jointly, in\naccordance with the complexity and non-linearity of the input data streams in\nan online fashion. Both theoretical analyses and empirical studies substantiate\nthe viability and effectiveness of our proposal.",

The large\nvariation of geometry and appearance, caused by articulated body poses, shapes\nand clothing types, are the key bottlenecks of this task. To overcome these\nchallenges, we present a simple yet powerful framework, named Generalizable\nNeural Performer (GNR), that learns a generalizable and robust neural body\nrepresentation over various geometry and appearance. Specifically, we compress\nthe light fields for novel view human rendering as conditional implicit neural\nradiance fields from both geometry and appearance aspects. We first introduce\nan Implicit Geometric Body Embedding strategy to enhance the robustness based\non both parametric 3D human body model and multi-view images hints. We further\npropose a Screen-Space Occlusion-Aware Appearance Blending technique to\npreserve the high-quality appearance, through interpolating source view\nappearance to the radiance fields with a relax but approximate geometric\nguidance.\nTo evaluate our method, we present our ongoing effort of constructing a\ndataset with remarkable complexity and diversity.

A PVASS is said to be\n\\emph{bidirected} if every transition (pushing/popping a symbol or modifying a\ncounter) has an accompanying opposite transition that reverses the effect.\nBidirectedness arises naturally in many models; it can also be seen as a\noverapproximation of reachability. We show that the reachability problem for\n\\emph{bidirected} PVASS is decidable in Ackermann time and primitive recursive\nfor any fixed dimension. For the special case of one-dimensional bidirected\nPVASS, we show reachability is in $\\mathsf{PSPACE}$, and in fact in polynomial\ntime if the stack is polynomially bounded.

    "title": "Parallel Synthesis for Autoregressive Speech Generation",
    "abstract": "Autoregressive models have achieved outstanding performance in neural speech\nsynthesis tasks. Though they can generate highly natural human speech, the\niterative generation inevitably makes the synthesis time proportional to the\nutterance's length, leading to low efficiency. Many works were dedicated to\ngenerating the whole speech time sequence in parallel and then proposed\nGAN-based, flow-based, and score-based models. This paper proposed a new\nthought for the autoregressive generation. Instead of iteratively predicting\nsamples in a time sequence, the proposed model performs frequency-wise\nautoregressive generation (FAR) and bit-wise autoregressive generation (BAR) to\nsynthesize speech. In FAR, a speech utterance is first split into different\nfrequency subbands. The proposed model generates a subband conditioned on the\npreviously generated one. A full band speech can then be reconstructed by using\nthese generated subbands and a synthesis filter bank. Similarly, in BAR, an\n8-bit quantized signal is generated iteratively from the first bit. By\nredesigning the autoregressive method to compute in domains other than the time\ndomain, the number of iterations in the proposed model is no longer\nproportional to the utterance's length but the number of subbands/bits. The\ninference efficiency is hence significantly increased. Besides, a post-filter\nis employed to sample audio signals from output posteriors, and its training\nobjective is designed based on the characteristics of the proposed\nautoregressive methods. The experimental results show that the proposed model\nis able to synthesize speech faster than real-time without GPU acceleration.\nCompared with the baseline autoregressive and non-autoregressive models, the\nproposed model achieves better MOS and shows its good generalization ability\nwhile synthesizing 44 kHz speech or utterances from unseen speakers.",

    "abstract": "Generative image synthesis with diffusion models has recently achieved\nexcellent visual quality in several tasks such as text-based or\nclass-conditional image synthesis. Much of this success is due to a dramatic\nincrease in the computational capacity invested in training these models. This\nwork presents an alternative approach: inspired by its successful application\nin natural language processing, we propose to complement the diffusion model\nwith a retrieval-based approach and to introduce an explicit memory in the form\nof an external database. During training, our diffusion model is trained with\nsimilar visual features retrieved via CLIP and from the neighborhood of each\ntraining instance. By leveraging CLIP's joint image-text embedding space, our\nmodel achieves highly competitive performance on tasks for which it has not\nbeen explicitly trained, such as class-conditional or text-image synthesis, and\ncan be conditioned on both text and image embeddings. Moreover, we can apply\nour approach to unconditional generation, where it achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance. Our approach incurs low computational and memory overheads and is\neasy to implement. We discuss its relationship to concurrent work and will\npublish code and pretrained models soon.",

    "abstract": "Existing work on personality traits in software development excludes game\ndevelopers as a discrete group. Whilst games are software, game development has\nunique considerations, so game developers may exhibit different personality\ntraits from other software professionals. We assessed responses from 123 game\ndevelopers on an International Personality Item Pool Five Factor Model scale\nand demographic questionnaire using factor analysis. Programmers reported lower\nExtraversion than designers, artists and production team members; lower\nOpenness than designers and production, and reported higher Neuroticism than\nproduction -- potentially linked to burnout and crunch time. Compared to\npublished norms of software developers, game developers reported lower\nOpenness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion and Agreeableness, but higher\nNeuroticism. These personality differences have many practical implications:\ndifferences in Extraversion among roles may precipitate communication\nbreakdowns; differences in Openness may induce conflict between programmers and\ndesigners. Understanding the relationship between personality traits and roles\ncan help recruiters steer new employees into appropriate roles, and help\nmanagers apply appropriate stress management techniques. To realise these\nbenefits, individuals must be distinguished from roles: just because an\nindividual occupies a role does not mean they possess personality traits\nassociated with that role.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of representation learning\napproaches for decision making in visually complex environments. Representation\nlearning is essential for effective reinforcement learning (RL) from\nhigh-dimensional inputs. Unsupervised representation learning approaches based\non reconstruction, prediction or contrastive learning have shown substantial\nlearning efficiency gains. Yet, they have mostly been evaluated in clean\nlaboratory or simulated settings. In contrast, real environments are visually\ncomplex and contain substantial amounts of clutter and distractors.\nUnsupervised representations will learn to model such distractors, potentially\nimpairing the agent's learning efficiency. In contrast, an alternative class of\napproaches, which we call task-induced representation learning, leverages task\ninformation such as rewards or demonstrations from prior tasks to focus on\ntask-relevant parts of the scene and ignore distractors. We investigate the\neffectiveness of unsupervised and task-induced representation learning\napproaches on four visually complex environments, from Distracting DMControl to\nthe CARLA driving simulator. For both, RL and imitation learning, we find that\nrepresentation learning generally improves sample efficiency on unseen tasks\neven in visually complex scenes and that task-induced representations can\ndouble learning efficiency compared to unsupervised alternatives.

    "abstract": "While deep reinforcement learning methods have shown impressive results in\nrobot learning, their sample inefficiency makes the learning of complex,\nlong-horizon behaviors with real robot systems infeasible. To mitigate this\nissue, meta-reinforcement learning methods aim to enable fast learning on novel\ntasks by learning how to learn. Yet, the application has been limited to\nshort-horizon tasks with dense rewards. To enable learning long-horizon\nbehaviors, recent works have explored leveraging prior experience in the form\nof offline datasets without reward or task annotations. While these approaches\nyield improved sample efficiency, millions of interactions with environments\nare still required to solve complex tasks. In this work, we devise a method\nthat enables meta-learning on long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks, allowing us to\nsolve unseen target tasks with orders of magnitude fewer environment\ninteractions. Our core idea is to leverage prior experience extracted from\noffline datasets during meta-learning. Specifically, we propose to (1) extract\nreusable skills and a skill prior from offline datasets, (2) meta-train a\nhigh-level policy that learns to efficiently compose learned skills into\nlong-horizon behaviors, and (3) rapidly adapt the meta-trained policy to solve\nan unseen target task. Experimental results on continuous control tasks in\nnavigation and manipulation demonstrate that the proposed method can\nefficiently solve long-horizon novel target tasks by combining the strengths of\nmeta-learning and the usage of offline datasets, while prior approaches in RL,\nmeta-RL, and multi-task RL require substantially more environment interactions\nto solve the tasks.",

Global\nExplanation loss forces the student prototypes to be close to teacher\nprototypes, and Patch-Prototype Correspondence loss enforces the local\nrepresentations of the student to be similar to that of the teacher. Further,\nwe propose three novel metrics to evaluate the student's proximity to the\nteacher as measures of interpretability transfer in our settings.

    "abstract": "Traditional network models encapsulate travel behavior among all\norigin-destination pairs based on a simplified and generic utility function.\nTypically, the utility function consists of travel time solely and its\ncoefficients are equated to estimates obtained from stated preference data.\nWhile this modeling strategy is reasonable, the inherent sampling bias in\nindividual-level data may be further amplified over network flow aggregation,\nleading to inaccurate flow estimates. This data must be collected from surveys\nor travel diaries, which may be labor intensive, costly and limited to a small\ntime period. To address these limitations, this study extends classical\nbi-level formulations to estimate travelers' utility functions with multiple\nattributes using system-level data. We formulate a methodology grounded on\nnon-linear least squares to statistically infer travelers' utility function in\nthe network context using traffic counts, traffic speeds, traffic incidents and\nsociodemographic information, among other attributes. The analysis of the\nmathematical properties of the optimization problem and of its pseudo-convexity\nmotivate the use of normalized gradient descent. We also develop a hypothesis\ntest framework to examine statistical properties of the utility function\ncoefficients and to perform attributes selection. Experiments on synthetic data\nshow that the coefficients are consistently recovered and that hypothesis tests\nare a reliable statistic to identify which attributes are determinants of\ntravelers' route choices. Besides, a series of Monte-Carlo experiments suggest\nthat statistical inference is robust to noise in the Origin-Destination matrix\nand in the traffic counts, and to various levels of sensor coverage.

    "abstract": "Supervised deep learning needs a large amount of labeled data to achieve high\nperformance. However, in medical imaging analysis, each site may only have a\nlimited amount of data and labels, which makes learning ineffective. Federated\nlearning (FL) can help in this regard by learning a shared model while keeping\ntraining data local for privacy. Traditional FL requires fully-labeled data for\ntraining, which is inconvenient or sometimes infeasible to obtain due to high\nlabeling cost and the requirement of expertise. Contrastive learning (CL), as a\nself-supervised learning approach, can effectively learn from unlabeled data to\npre-train a neural network encoder, followed by fine-tuning for downstream\ntasks with limited annotations. However, when adopting CL in FL, the limited\ndata diversity on each client makes federated contrastive learning (FCL)\nineffective.

More specifically, we exchange the\nfeatures in the FCL pre-training process such that diverse contrastive data are\nprovided to each site for effective local CL while keeping raw data private.\nBased on the exchanged features, global structural matching further leverages\nthe structural similarity to align local features to the remote ones such that\na unified feature space can be learned among different sites.

However,\nlimited by the nature of supervised training, most existing separation methods\nrequire ground-truth sources and are trained on synthetic datasets. This\nground-truth reliance is problematic, because the ground-truth signals are\nusually unavailable in real conditions. Moreover, in many industry scenarios,\nthe real acoustic characteristics deviate far from the ones in simulated\ndatasets. Therefore, the performance usually degrades significantly when\napplying the supervised speech separation models to real applications. To\naddress these problems, in this study, we propose a novel separation\nconsistency training, termed SCT, to exploit the real-world unlabeled mixtures\nfor improving cross-domain unsupervised speech separation in an iterative\nmanner, by leveraging upon the complementary information obtained from\nheterogeneous (structurally distinct but behaviorally complementary) models.\nSCT follows a framework using two heterogeneous neural networks (HNNs) to\nproduce high confidence pseudo labels of unlabeled real speech mixtures. These\nlabels are then updated, and used to refine the HNNs to produce more reliable\nconsistent separation results for real mixture pseudo-labeling. To maximally\nutilize the large complementary information between different separation\nnetworks, a cross-knowledge adaptation is further proposed. Together with\nsimulated dataset, those real mixtures with high confidence pseudo labels are\nthen used to update the HNN separation models iteratively.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an automatic brain tumor segmentation approach\n(e.g., PixelNet) using a pixel-level convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nmodel extracts feature from multiple convolutional layers and concatenate them\nto form a hyper-column where samples a modest number of pixels for\noptimization. Hyper-column ensures both local and global contextual information\nfor pixel-wise predictors. The model confirms the statistical efficiency by\nsampling a few pixels in the training phase where spatial redundancy limits the\ninformation learning among the neighboring pixels in conventional pixel-level\nsemantic segmentation approaches. Besides, label skewness in training data\nleads the convolutional model often converge to certain classes which is a\ncommon problem in the medical dataset. We deal with this problem by selecting\nan equal number of pixels for all the classes in sampling time. The proposed\nmodel has achieved promising results in brain tumor and ischemic stroke lesion\nsegmentation datasets.",

Finally, numerical results show that the\nproposed design based on CRLB minimization achieves improved sensing\nperformance in terms of lower estimation mean squared error (MSE), as compared\nto the traditional schemes with signal-to-noise ratio maximization and separate\nbeamforming designs.",

The most challenging problem in such\nmodels - sampling the posterior distribution over latent variables - is\nproposed to be solved by harnessing natural sources of stochasticity inherent\nin electronic and neural systems. We demonstrate this idea for a sparse coding\nmodel by deriving a continuous-time equation for inferring its latent variables\nvia Langevin dynamics. The model parameters are learned by simultaneously\nevolving according to another continuous-time equation, thus bypassing the need\nfor digital accumulators or a global clock. Moreover we show that Langevin\ndynamics lead to an efficient procedure for sampling from the posterior\ndistribution in the 'L0 sparse' regime, where latent variables are encouraged\nto be set to zero as opposed to having a small L1 norm. This allows the model\nto properly incorporate the notion of sparsity rather than having to resort to\na relaxed version of sparsity to make optimization tractable.

We show that for sufficiently slow-growing $f$, $f$-shift complex\nsequences can be uniformly computed by $g$-complex sequences, where $g$ grows\nslightly faster than $f$.\nThe structure of the $\\mathrm{LUA}$ hierarchy is examined using bushy tree\nforcing, with the main result being that for any order function $p$, there is a\nslow-growing order function $q$ such that $\\mathrm{LUA}(p)$ and\n$\\mathrm{LUA}(q)$ are weakly incomparable. Using this, we prove new results\nabout the filter of the weak degrees of deep nonempty $\\Pi^0_1$ classes and the\nconnection between the shift complexity and $\\mathrm{LUA}$ hierarchies.",

    "abstract": "Several deep learning algorithms have been developed to predict survival of\ncancer patients using whole slide images (WSIs).However, identification of\nimage phenotypes within the WSIs that are relevant to patient survival and\ndisease progression is difficult for both clinicians, and deep learning\nalgorithms. Most deep learning based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)\nalgorithms for survival prediction use either top instances (e.g., maxpooling)\nor top/bottom instances (e.g., MesoNet) to identify image phenotypes. In this\nstudy, we hypothesize that wholistic information of the distribution of the\npatch scores within a WSI can predict the cancer survival better. We developed\na distribution based multiple-instance survival learning algorithm\n(DeepDisMISL) to validate this hypothesis. We designed and executed experiments\nusing two large international colorectal cancer WSIs datasets - MCO CRC and\nTCGA COAD-READ. Our results suggest that the more information about the\ndistribution of the patch scores for a WSI, the better is the prediction\nperformance. Including multiple neighborhood instances around each selected\ndistribution location (e.g., percentiles) could further improve the prediction.\nDeepDisMISL demonstrated superior predictive ability compared to other recently\npublished, state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, our algorithm is\ninterpretable and could assist in understanding the relationship between cancer\nmorphological phenotypes and patients cancer survival risk.",

However, its application to real data is limited since it requires\nlarge datasets of noisy-clean pairs that are difficult to obtain. For this\nreason, networks are often trained on realistic synthetic data. More recently,\nsome self-supervised frameworks have been proposed for training such denoising\nnetworks directly on the noisy data without requiring ground truth. On\nsynthetic denoising problems supervised training outperforms self-supervised\napproaches, however in recent years the gap has become narrower, especially for\nvideo. In this paper, we propose a study aiming to determine which is the best\napproach to train denoising networks for real raw videos: supervision on\nsynthetic realistic data or self-supervision on real data. A complete study\nwith quantitative results in case of natural videos with real motion is\nimpossible since no dataset with clean-noisy pairs exists. We address this\nissue by considering three independent experiments in which we compare the two\nframeworks.

We assess\nwhether the clinical delineations are machine interpretable by deep learning\nnetworks or if image processing refined contour should be used. By providing\nbenchmark results using a selection of popular deep learning algorithms, we\ndraw new insights into the limitations of DFU wound delineation and report on\nthe associated issues. This paper provides some observations on baseline models\nto facilitate DFUC2022 Challenge in conjunction with MICCAI 2022. The\nleaderboard will be ranked by Dice score, where the best FCN-based method is\n0.5708 and DeepLabv3+ achieved the best score of 0.6277. This paper\ndemonstrates that image processing using refined contour as ground truth can\nprovide better agreement with machine predicted results. DFUC2022 will be\nreleased on the 27th April 2022.",

Prevention and\nearly intervention are known to be the most effective forms of its management.\nNon-invasive imaging methods hold great promises for early stratification, but\nat present lack the sensitivity for personalized prognosis. Resting-state\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), a powerful tool previously\nused for mapping neural activity, is available in most hospitals. Here we show\nthat rs-fMRI can be used to map cerebral hemodynamic function and delineate\nimpairment. By exploiting time variations in breathing pattern during rs-fMRI,\ndeep learning enables reproducible mapping of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR)\nand bolus arrive time (BAT) of the human brain using resting-state CO2\nfluctuations as a natural 'contrast media'.

    "abstract": "An extreme event is a sudden and violent change in the state of a nonlinear\nsystem. In fluid dynamics, extreme events can have adverse effects on the\nsystem's optimal design and operability, which calls for accurate methods for\ntheir prediction and control. In this paper, we propose a data-driven\nmethodology for the prediction and control of extreme events in a chaotic shear\nflow. The approach is based on echo state networks, which are a type of\nreservoir computing that learn temporal correlations within a time-dependent\ndataset. The objective is five-fold. First, we exploit ad-hoc metrics from\nbinary classification to analyse (i) how many of the extreme events predicted\nby the network actually occur in the test set (precision), and (ii) how many\nextreme events are missed by the network (recall). We apply a principled\nstrategy for optimal hyperparameter selection, which is key to the networks'\nperformance. Second, we focus on the time-accurate prediction of extreme\nevents. We show that echo state networks are able to predict extreme events\nwell beyond the predictability time, i.e., up to more than five Lyapunov times.\nThird, we focus on the long-term prediction of extreme events from a\nstatistical point of view. By training the networks with datasets that contain\nnon-converged statistics, we show that the networks are able to learn and\nextrapolate the flow's long-term statistics. In other words, the networks are\nable to extrapolate in time from relatively short time series. Fourth, we\ndesign a simple and effective control strategy to prevent extreme events from\noccurring. The control strategy decreases the occurrence of extreme events up\nto one order of magnitude with respect to the uncontrolled system. Finally, we\nanalyse the robustness of the results for a range of Reynolds numbers. We show\nthat the networks perform well across a wide range of regimes.",

This is mainly done in industry through manual visual inspection\nfor plate pattern irregularities, which is time-consuming and prone to human\nerror and thus act as a significant barrier to high-throughput production.\nAdvances in deep learning-driven computer vision has led to the exploration of\nautomated visual quality inspection of light guide plates to improve inspection\nconsistency, accuracy, and efficiency. However, given the cost constraints in\nvisual inspection scenarios, the widespread adoption of deep learning-driven\ncomputer vision methods for inspecting light guide plates has been greatly\nlimited due to high computational requirements.

We incorporate the\nproposed methods into Spectral Domain OCT (SD-OCT) imaging of human coronary\nsamples with clinical features such as stent and calcified lesions. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that spectral-spatial downscaled data can be\nbetter reconstructed than data that is downscaled solely in either spectral or\nspatial domain.

However, ECG is infeasible for\ncontinuous cardiac monitoring due to its requirement for user participation.\nMeanwhile, photoplethysmography (PPG) is easy to collect, but the limited\naccuracy constrains its clinical usage. In this research, a novel\nTransformer-based architecture, Performer, is invented to reconstruct ECG from\nPPG and to create a novel digital biomarker, PPG along with its reconstructed\nECG, as multiple modalities for CVD detection. This architecture, for the first\ntime, performs Transformer sequence to sequence translation on biomedical\nwaveforms, while also utilizing the advantages of the easily accessible PPG and\nthe well-studied base of ECG. Shifted Patch-based Attention (SPA) is created to\nmaximize the signal features by fetching the various sequence lengths as\nhierarchical stages into the training while also capturing cross-patch\nconnections through the shifted patch mechanism. This architecture generates a\nstate-of-the-art performance of 0.29 RMSE for reconstructing ECG from PPG,\nachieving an average of 95.9% diagnosis for CVDs on the MIMIC III dataset and\n75.9% for diabetes on the PPG-BP dataset.

    "abstract": "In the near-future, dedicated telescopes observe Earth-like exoplanets in\nreflected light, allowing their characterization. Because of the huge\ndistances, every exoplanet will be a single pixel, but temporal variations in\nits spectral flux hold information about the planet's surface and atmosphere.\nWe test convolutional neural networks for retrieving a planet's rotation axis,\nsurface and cloud map from simulated single-pixel flux and polarization\nobservations. We investigate the assumption that the planets reflect Lambertian\nin the retrieval while their actual reflection is bidirectional, and of\nincluding polarization in retrievals. We simulate observations along a planet's\norbit using a radiative transfer algorithm that includes polarization and\nbidirectional reflection by vegetation, desert, oceans, water clouds, and\nRayleigh scattering in 6 spectral bands from 400 to 800 nm, at various photon\nnoise levels. The surface-types and cloud patterns of the facets covering a\nmodel planet are based on probability distributions. Our networks are trained\nwith simulated observations of millions of planets before retrieving maps of\ntest planets. The neural networks can constrain rotation axes with a mean\nsquared error (MSE) as small as 0.0097, depending on the orbital inclination.\nOn a bidirectionally reflecting planet, 92% of ocean and 85% of vegetation,\ndesert, and cloud facets are correctly retrieved, in the absence of noise. With\nrealistic noise, it should still be possible to retrieve the main map features\nwith a dedicated telescope. Except for face-on orbits, a network trained with\nLambertian reflecting planets, yields significant retrieval errors when given\nobservations of bidirectionally reflecting planets, in particular, brightness\nartefacts around a planet's pole. Including polarization improves retrieving\nthe rotation axis and the accuracy of the retrieval of ocean and cloud facets.",
