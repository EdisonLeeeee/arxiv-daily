    "abstract": "Gradient descent is slow to converge for ill-conditioned problems and\nnon-convex problems. An important technique for acceleration is step-size\nadaptation. The first part of this paper contains a detailed review of\nstep-size adaptation methods, including Polyak step-size, L4, LossGrad, Adam\nand IDBD. In the second part of this paper, we propose a new class of methods\nof accelerating gradient descent that are quite different from existing\ntechniques. The new methods, which we call {\\em step-size planning}, use the\n{\\em update experience} to learn an improved way of updating the parameters.\nThe methods organize the experience into $K$ steps away from each other to\nfacilitate planning. From the past experience, our planning algorithm, Csawg,\nlearns a step-size model which is a form of multi-step machine that predicts\nfuture updates. We extends Csawg to applying step-size planning multiple steps,\nwhich leads to further speedup. We discuss and highlight the projection power\nof the diagonal-matrix step-size for future large scale applications. We show\nfor a convex problem, our methods can surpass the convergence rate of\nNesterov's accelerated gradient, $1 - \\sqrt{\\mu/L}$, where $\\mu, L$ are the\nstrongly convex factor of the loss function $F$ and the Lipschitz constant of\n$F'$. On the classical non-convex Rosenbrock function, our planning methods\nachieve zero error below 500 gradient evaluations, while gradient descent takes\nabout 10000 gradient evaluations to reach a $10^{-3}$ accuracy. We discuss the\nconnection of step-size planing to planning in reinforcement learning, in\nparticular, Dyna architectures. We leave convergence and convergence rate\nproofs and applications of the methods to high-dimensional problems for future\nwork.",

There\nare various aggregation techniques, some of which come down to a simple and\nsometimes effective deterministic aggregation rule. However, it has been shown\nthat the efficiency of those techniques is unstable under varying conditions\nand within different domains. Other methods mainly rely on learning from the\ndecision-makers previous responses or the availability of additional\ninformation about them. In this study, we present two one-shot\nmachine-learning-based aggregation approaches. The first predicts, given\nmultiple features about the collective's choices, including meta-cognitive\nones, which aggregation method will be best for a given case. The second\ndirectly predicts which decision is optimal, given, among other things, the\nselection made by each method. We offer a meta-cognitive feature-engineering\napproach for characterizing a collective decision-making case in a\ncontext-sensitive fashion. In addition, we offer a new aggregation method, the\nDevil's-Advocate aggregator, to deal with cases in which standard aggregation\nmethods are predicted to fail. Experimental results show that using either of\nour proposed approaches increases the percentage of successfully aggregated\ncases (i.e., cases in which the correct answer is returned) significantly,\ncompared to the uniform application of each rule-based aggregation method.

    "abstract": "We propose a new learning algorithm for propagating a learning signal and\nupdating neural network parameters via a forward pass, as an alternative to\nbackpropagation. In forward signal propagation learning (sigprop), there is\nonly the forward path for learning and inference, so there are no additional\nstructural or computational constraints on learning, such as feedback\nconnectivity, weight transport, or a backward pass, which exist under\nbackpropagation. Sigprop enables global supervised learning with only a forward\npath. This is ideal for parallel training of layers or modules. In biology,\nthis explains how neurons without feedback connections can still receive a\nglobal learning signal. In hardware, this provides an approach for global\nsupervised learning without backward connectivity. Sigprop by design has better\ncompatibility with models of learning in the brain and in hardware than\nbackpropagation and alternative approaches to relaxing learning constraints. We\nalso demonstrate that sigprop is more efficient in time and memory than they\nare. To further explain the behavior of sigprop, we provide evidence that\nsigprop provides useful learning signals in context to backpropagation. To\nfurther support relevance to biological and hardware learning, we use sigprop\nto train continuous time neural networks with Hebbian updates and train spiking\nneural networks without surrogate functions.",

    "title": "Distinguishing Homophenes Using Multi-Head Visual-Audio Memory for Lip  Reading",
    "abstract": "Recognizing speech from silent lip movement, which is called lip reading, is\na challenging task due to 1) the inherent information insufficiency of lip\nmovement to fully represent the speech, and 2) the existence of homophenes that\nhave similar lip movement with different pronunciations. In this paper, we try\nto alleviate the aforementioned two challenges in lip reading by proposing a\nMulti-head Visual-audio Memory (MVM). Firstly, MVM is trained with audio-visual\ndatasets and remembers audio representations by modelling the\ninter-relationships of paired audio-visual representations. At the inference\nstage, visual input alone can extract the saved audio representation from the\nmemory by examining the learned inter-relationships. Therefore, the lip reading\nmodel can complement the insufficient visual information with the extracted\naudio representations. Secondly, MVM is composed of multi-head key memories for\nsaving visual features and one value memory for saving audio knowledge, which\nis designed to distinguish the homophenes. With the multi-head key memories,\nMVM extracts possible candidate audio features from the memory, which allows\nthe lip reading model to consider the possibility of which pronunciations can\nbe represented from the input lip movement. This also can be viewed as an\nexplicit implementation of the one-to-many mapping of viseme-to-phoneme.\nMoreover, MVM is employed in multi-temporal levels to consider the context when\nretrieving the memory and distinguish the homophenes. Extensive experimental\nresults verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in lip reading and in\ndistinguishing the homophenes.",

Specifically, the\nproposed VCA-GAN synthesizes the speech from local lip visual features by\nfinding a mapping function of viseme-to-phoneme, while global visual context is\nembedded into the intermediate layers of the generator to clarify the ambiguity\nin the mapping induced by homophene. To achieve this, a visual context\nattention module is proposed where it encodes global representations from the\nlocal visual features, and provides the desired global visual context\ncorresponding to the given coarse speech representation to the generator\nthrough audio-visual attention. In addition to the explicit modelling of local\nand global visual representations, synchronization learning is introduced as a\nform of contrastive learning that guides the generator to synthesize a speech\nin sync with the given input lip movements. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed VCA-GAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art and is able to\neffectively synthesize the speech from multi-speaker that has been barely\nhandled in the previous works.",

This model\ngeneralizes two special cases: a classic moral hazard setting, and a more\nrecently studied problem of incentivizing information acquisition (IA). We show\nthat all of these problems can be reduced to the design of a proper scoring\nrule. Under a limited liability condition, we consider the special cases\nseparately and then the general problem. We give novel results for the special\ncase of IA, giving a closed form \"pointed polyhedral cone\" solution for the\ngeneral multidimensional problem.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a self-supervised objective for learning representations\nthat localize objects under occlusion - a property known as object permanence.\nA central question is the choice of learning signal in cases of total\nocclusion. Rather than directly supervising the locations of invisible objects,\nwe propose a self-supervised objective that requires neither human annotation,\nnor assumptions about object dynamics. We show that object permanence can\nemerge by optimizing for temporal coherence of memory: we fit a Markov walk\nalong a space-time graph of memories, where the states in each time step are\nnon-Markovian features from a sequence encoder. This leads to a memory\nrepresentation that stores occluded objects and predicts their motion, to\nbetter localize them. The resulting model outperforms existing approaches on\nseveral datasets of increasing complexity and realism, despite requiring\nminimal supervision and assumptions, and hence being broadly applicable.",

However, there is no fingerprinting scheme aiming at achieving\nliability guarantees when sharing genomic databases. Thus, we are motivated to\nfill in this gap by devising a vanilla fingerprinting scheme specifically for\ngenomic databases. Moreover, since malicious genomic database recipients may\ncompromise the embedded fingerprint by launching effective correlation attacks\nwhich leverage the intrinsic correlations among genomic data (e.g., Mendel's\nlaw and linkage disequilibrium), we also augment the vanilla scheme by\ndeveloping mitigation techniques to achieve robust fingerprinting of genomic\ndatabases against correlation attacks.\nWe first show that correlation attacks against fingerprinting schemes for\ngenomic databases are very powerful. In particular, the correlation attacks can\ndistort more than half of the fingerprint bits by causing a small utility loss\n(e.g.,database accuracy and consistency of SNP-phenotype associations measured\nvia p-values). Next, we experimentally show that the correlation attacks can be\neffectively mitigated by our proposed mitigation techniques. We validate that\nthe attacker can hardly compromise a large portion of the fingerprint bits even\nif it pays a higher cost in terms of degradation of the database utility. For\nexample, with around 24% loss in accuracy and 20% loss in the consistency of\nSNP-phenotype associations, the attacker can only distort about 30% fingerprint\nbits, which is insufficient for it to avoid being accused.

However, it can\ntake a great deal of time and effort for teachers to mark assessments, and to\nprovide useful feedback to the students. Furthermore, it also creates a\nsignificant cognitive load on the assessors, especially in ensuring fairness\nand equity. Therefore, an alternative approach to marking called comparative\njudgement (CJ) has been proposed in the educational space. Inspired by the law\nof comparative judgment (LCJ). This pairwise comparison for as many pairs as\npossible can then be used to rank all submissions. Studies suggest that CJ is\nhighly reliable and accurate while making it quick for the teachers.\nAlternative studies have questioned this claim suggesting that the process can\nincrease bias in the results as the same submission is shown many times to an\nassessor for increasing reliability. Additionally, studies have also found that\nCJ can result in the overall marking process taking longer than a more\ntraditional method of marking as information about many pairs must be\ncollected.\nIn this paper, we investigate Elo, which has been extensively used in rating\nplayers in zero-sum games such as chess.

The respective visualization\ntechniques outline the algorithmic in- and outputs including indications, on\nhow sensitive an input is with regard to the outputs. The detailed sensitivity\ninformation is communicated through constellation plots for the exploration of\ninput and output spaces. A matrix view is discussed for localized information\non the sensitivity of specific outputs to specific inputs. A 3D view provides\nthe link of the parameter sensitivity to the spatial domain, in which the\nresults of the multi-dimensional algorithms are embedded. The proposed\nsensitivity analysis techniques are implemented and evaluated in a prototype\ncalled Sensitivity Explorer. We show that Sensitivity Explorer reliably\nidentifies the most influential parameters and provides insights into which of\nthe output characteristics these affect as well as to which extent.",

    "abstract": "When pieces from an individual's personal information available online are\nconnected over time and across multiple platforms, this more complete digital\ntrace can give unintended insights into their life and opinions. In a data\nnarrative interview study with 26 currently employed participants, we examined\nrisks and harms to individuals and employers when others joined the dots\nbetween their online information. We discuss the themes of visibility and\nself-disclosure, unintentional information leakage and digital privacy\nliteracies constructed from our analysis. We contribute insights not only into\npeople's difficulties in recalling and conceptualising their digital traces but\nof subsequently envisioning how their online information may be combined, or\n(re)identified across their traces and address a current gap in research by\nshowing that awareness is lacking around the potential for personal information\nto be correlated by and made coherent to/by others, posing risks to\nindividuals, employers, and even the state. We touch on inequalities of\nprivacy, freedom and legitimacy that exist for different groups with regard to\nwhat they make (or feel compelled to make) available online and we contribute\nto current methodological work on the use of sketching to support visual sense\nmaking in data narrative interviews. We conclude by discussing the need for\ninterventions that support personal reflection on the potential visibility of\ncombined digital traces to spotlight hidden vulnerabilities, and promote more\nproactive action about what is shared and not shared online.",

    "abstract": "Product market demand analysis plays a significant role for originating\nbusiness strategies due to its noticeable impact on the competitive business\nfield. Furthermore, there are roughly 228 million native Bengali speakers, the\nmajority of whom use Banglish text to interact with one another on social\nmedia. Consumers are buying and evaluating items on social media with Banglish\ntext as social media emerges as an online marketplace for entrepreneurs. People\nuse social media to find preferred smartphone brands and models by sharing\ntheir positive and bad experiences with them. For this reason, our goal is to\ngather Banglish text data and use sentiment analysis and named entity\nidentification to assess Bangladeshi market demand for smartphones in order to\ndetermine the most popular smartphones by gender. We scraped product related\ndata from social media with instant data scrapers and crawled data from\nWikipedia and other sites for product information with python web scrapers.\nUsing Python's Pandas and Seaborn libraries, the raw data is filtered using NLP\nmethods. To train our datasets for named entity recognition, we utilized\nSpacey's custom NER model, Amazon Comprehend Custom NER. A tensorflow\nsequential model was deployed with parameter tweaking for sentiment analysis.\nMeanwhile, we used the Google Cloud Translation API to estimate the gender of\nthe reviewers using the BanglaLinga library. In this article, we use natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) approaches and several machine learning models to\nidentify the most in-demand items and services in the Bangladeshi market. Our\nmodel has an accuracy of 87.99% in Spacy Custom Named Entity recognition,\n95.51% in Amazon Comprehend Custom NER, and 87.02% in the Sequential model for\ndemand analysis. After Spacy's study, we were able to manage 80% of mistakes\nrelated to misspelled words using a mix of Levenshtein distance and ratio\nalgorithms.",

    "abstract": "While commonly used for communication purposes, an increasing number of\nrecent studies consider WiFi for sensing. In particular, wireless signals are\naltered (e.g., reflected and attenuated) by the human body and objects in the\nenvironment. This can be perceived by an observer to infer information on human\nactivities or changes in the environment and, hence, to \"see\" over WiFi. Until\nnow, works on WiFi-based sensing have resulted in a set of custom software\ntools -- each designed for a specific purpose. Moreover, given how scattered\nthe literature is, it is difficult to even identify all steps/functions\nnecessary to build a basic system for WiFi-based sensing. This has led to a\nhigh entry barrier, hindering further research in this area. There has been no\neffort to integrate these tools or to build a general software framework that\ncan serve as the basis for further research, e.g., on using machine learning to\ninterpret the altered WiFi signals. To address this issue, in this paper, we\npropose WiFiEye -- a generic software framework that makes all necessary\nsteps/functions available \"out of the box\". This way, WiFiEye allows\nresearchers to easily bootstrap new WiFi-based sensing applications, thereby,\nfocusing on research rather than on implementation aspects. To illustrate\nWiFiEye's workflow, we present a case study on WiFi-based human activity\nrecognition.",

While ML techniques enable dealing with several\nproblems in self-adaptation, such as scalable decision-making, they are also\nsubject to inherent challenges. In this paper, we focus on one such challenge\nthat is particularly important for self-adaptation: ML techniques are designed\nto deal with a set of predefined tasks associated with an operational domain;\nthey have problems to deal with new emerging tasks, such as concept shift in\ninput data that is used for learning. To tackle this challenge, we present\n\\textit{lifelong self-adaptation}: a novel approach to self-adaptation that\nenhances self-adaptive systems that use ML techniques with a lifelong ML layer.\nThe lifelong ML layer tracks the running system and its environment, associates\nthis knowledge with the current tasks, identifies new tasks based on\ndifferentiations, and updates the learning models of the self-adaptive system\naccordingly. We present a reusable architecture for lifelong self-adaptation\nand apply it to the case of concept drift caused by unforeseen changes of the\ninput data of a learning model that is used for decision-making in\nself-adaptation.

    "abstract": "Power system restoration is an essential activity for grid resilience, where\ngrid operators restart generators, re-establish transmission paths, and restore\nloads after a blackout event. The core decisions in restoration planning are to\npartition the grid into a few sub-networks, each of which has an initial power\nsource for black-start (called sectionalization problem), and then restart the\ngenerators and pick up the loads in each network (called generator startup\nsequencing problem or GSS) in a parallel fashion, aiming to restore electric\nservice in shortest time. Due to the significant complexity of each problem,\nthe sectionalization and GSS problems are usually solved separately, resulting\nin a sub-optimal solution. In this work, we develop models and computational\nmethods to solve the two problems simultaneously. We first study the\ncomputational complexity of the GSS problem and develop an efficient integer\nlinear programming formulation. We then integrate the GSS problem with the\nsectionalization problem and develop an integer linear programming formulation\nfor PPSR to find exact optimal solutions. To scale up to larger systems, we\nthen develop bounding approaches that find an upper bound and a lower bound\nefficiently. At last, to address challenges in extreme cases where a\nultra-large power grid needs to be restored when the solution time is strictly\nlimited, we develop a randomized rounding method to find a feasible solution\nwith satisfied quality in a very short time. The computational experiments\ndemonstrate that the set of proposed approaches are able to find a good\nsolution for PPSR in up to 2000-bus systems.",

Given non convexity of\nthe objective function, it is challenging to avoid from different local minima.\nMethods: We first formulate the global searching of multiply parameters to be a\nk-D move in the parametric space, and convert parameters updating to be\nstate-action decision-making problem. We proposed a novel Deep Q-learning of\nModel Parameters (DQMP) method for global optimization of model parameters by\nupdating the parameter configurations through actions that maximize a Q-value,\nwhich employs a Deep Reward Network designed to learn global reward values from\nboth visible curve fitting errors and hidden parameter errors. Results: The\nDQMP method was evaluated by viscoelastic imaging on soft matter by\nKelvin-Voigt fractional derivative (KVFD) modeling. In comparison to other\nmethods, imaging of parameters by DQMP yielded the smallest errors (< 2%) to\nthe ground truth images. DQMP was applied to viscoelastic imaging on biological\ntissues, which indicated a great potential of imaging on physical parameters in\ndiagnostic applications. Conclusions: DQMP method is able to achieve global\noptima, yielding accurate model parameter estimates in viscoelastic imaging.\nAssessment of DQMP by simulation imaging and ultrasound breast imaging\ndemonstrated the consistency, reliability of the imaged parameters, and\npowerful global searching ability of DQMP.

    "title": "A Data-Driven Framework for Identifying Investment Opportunities in  Private Equity",
    "abstract": "The core activity of a Private Equity (PE) firm is to invest into companies\nin order to provide the investors with profit, usually within 4-7 years. To\ninvest into a company or not is typically done manually by looking at various\nperformance indicators of the company and then making a decision often based on\ninstinct. This process is rather unmanageable given the large number of\ncompanies to potentially invest. Moreover, as more data about company\nperformance indicators becomes available and the number of different indicators\none may want to consider increases, manual crawling and assessment of\ninvestment opportunities becomes inefficient and ultimately impossible. To\naddress these issues, this paper proposes a framework for automated data-driven\nscreening of investment opportunities and thus the recommendation of businesses\nto invest in. The framework draws on data from several sources to assess the\nfinancial and managerial position of a company, and then uses an explainable\nartificial intelligence (XAI) engine to suggest investment recommendations. The\nrobustness of the model is validated using different AI algorithms, class\nimbalance-handling methods, and features extracted from the available data\nsources.",

    "title": "A Survey on Graph Representation Learning Methods",
    "abstract": "Graphs representation learning has been a very active research area in recent\nyears. The goal of graph representation learning is to generate graph\nrepresentation vectors that capture the structure and features of large graphs\naccurately. This is especially important because the quality of the graph\nrepresentation vectors will affect the performance of these vectors in\ndownstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction and anomaly\ndetection. Many techniques are proposed for generating effective graph\nrepresentation vectors. Two of the most prevalent categories of graph\nrepresentation learning are graph embedding methods without using graph neural\nnets (GNN), which we denote as non-GNN based graph embedding methods, and graph\nneural nets (GNN) based methods. Non-GNN graph embedding methods are based on\ntechniques such as random walks, temporal point processes and neural network\nlearning methods. GNN-based methods, on the other hand, are the application of\ndeep learning on graph data. In this survey, we provide an overview of these\ntwo categories and cover the current state-of-the-art methods for both static\nand dynamic graphs. Finally, we explore some open and ongoing research\ndirections for future work.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the problem of multitasking scheduling has attracted a lot of\nattention in the service industries where workers frequently perform multiple\ntasks by switching from one task to another. Hall, Leung and Li (Discrete\nApplied Mathematics 2016) proposed a shared processing multitasking scheduling\nmodel which allows a team to continue to work on the primary tasks while\nprocessing the routinely scheduled activities as they occur. The processing\nsharing is achieved by allocating a fraction of the processing capacity to\nroutine jobs and the remaining fraction, which we denote as sharing ratio, to\nthe primary jobs.\nIn this paper, we generalize this model to parallel machines and allow the\nfraction of the processing capacity assigned to routine jobs to vary from one\nto another. The objectives are minimizing makespan and minimizing the total\ncompletion time. We show that for both objectives, there is no polynomial time\napproximation algorithm unless P=NP if the sharing ratios are arbitrary for all\nmachines. Then we consider the problems where the sharing ratios on some\nmachines have a constant lower bound. For each objective, we analyze the\nperformance of the classical scheduling algorithms and their variations and\nthen develop a polynomial time approximation scheme when the number of machines\nis a constant.",

The previous gaits analyzed in the tilt-rotor research\nare inspired by animals; no theoretical base backs the robustness of these\ngaits. This research deduces the gaits by diminishing the effect of the\nattitude of the tilt-rotor for the first time. Four-dimensional gait surfaces\nare subsequently found, on which the gaits are expected to be robust to the\nattitude. These surfaces provide the region where the gait is suggested to be\nplanned. However, a discontinuous region may hinder the gait plan process while\nutilizing the proposal gait surfaces. A Two Color Map Theorem is then\nestablished to guarantee the continuity of each gait designed. The robustness\nof the typical gaits obeying the Two Color Map Theorem and on the gait surface\nis demonstrated by comparing the singular curve in attitude with the gaits not\non the gait surface. The result shows that the acceptable attitudes enlarge for\nthe gaits on the gait surface.",

    "abstract": "Predicting pedestrian crossing intention is an indispensable aspect of\ndeploying advanced driving systems (ADS) or advanced driver-assistance systems\n(ADAS) to real life. State-of-the-art methods in predicting pedestrian crossing\nintention often rely on multiple streams of information as inputs, each of\nwhich requires massive computational resources and heavy network architectures\nto generate. However, such reliance limits the practical application of the\nsystems. In this paper, driven the the real-world demands of pedestrian\ncrossing intention prediction models with both high efficiency and accuracy, we\nintroduce a network with only frames of pedestrians as the input. Every\ncomponent in the introduced network is driven by the goal of light weight.\nSpecifically, we reduce the multi-source input dependency and employ light\nneural networks that are tailored for mobile devices. These smaller neural\nnetworks can fit into computer memory and can be transmitted over a computer\nnetwork more easily, thus making them more suitable for real-life deployment\nand real-time prediction. To compensate the removal of the multi-source input,\nwe enhance the network effectiveness by adopting a multi-task learning\ntraining, named \"side task learning\", to include multiple auxiliary tasks to\njointly learn the feature extractor for improved robustness. Each head handles\na specific task that potentially shares knowledge with other heads. In the\nmeantime, the feature extractor is shared across all tasks to ensure the\nsharing of basic knowledge across all layers. The light weight but high\nefficiency characteristics of our model endow it the potential of being\ndeployed on vehicle-based systems. Experiments validate that our model\nconsistently delivers outstanding performances.",

    "abstract": "Location data use has become pervasive in the last decade due to the advent\nof mobile apps, as well as novel areas such as smart health, smart cities, etc.\nAt the same time, significant concerns have surfaced with respect to fairness\nin data processing. Individuals from certain population segments may be\nunfairly treated when being considered for loan or job applications, access to\npublic resources, or other types of services. In the case of location data,\nfairness is an important concern, given that an individual's whereabouts are\noften correlated with sensitive attributes, e.g., race, income, education.\nWhile fairness has received significant attention recently, e.g., in the case\nof machine learning, there is little focus on the challenges of achieving\nfairness when dealing with location data. Due to their characteristics and\nspecific type of processing algorithms, location data pose important fairness\nchallenges that must be addressed in a comprehensive and effective manner. In\nthis paper, we adapt existing fairness models to suit the specific properties\nof location data and spatial processing. We focus on individual fairness, which\nis more difficult to achieve, and more relevant for most location data\nprocessing scenarios. First, we devise a novel building block to achieve\nfairness in the form of fair polynomials. Then, we propose two mechanisms based\non fair polynomials that achieve individual fairness, corresponding to two\ncommon interaction types based on location data. Extensive experimental results\non real data show that the proposed mechanisms achieve individual location\nfairness without sacrificing utility.",

    "abstract": "Traditional deep learning interpretability methods which are suitable for\nnon-expert users cannot explain network behaviors at the global level and are\ninflexible at providing fine-grained explanations. As a solution, concept-based\nexplanations are gaining attention due to their human intuitiveness and their\nflexibility to describe both global and local model behaviors. Concepts are\ngroups of similarly meaningful pixels that express a notion, embedded within\nthe network's latent space and have primarily been hand-generated, but have\nrecently been discovered by automated approaches. Unfortunately, the magnitude\nand diversity of discovered concepts makes it difficult for non-experts to\nnavigate and make sense of the concept space, and lack of easy-to-use software\nalso makes concept explanations inaccessible to many non-expert users. Visual\nanalytics can serve a valuable role in bridging these gaps by enabling\nstructured navigation and exploration of the concept space to provide\nconcept-based insights of model behavior to users. To this end, we design,\ndevelop, and validate ConceptExplainer, a visual analytics system that enables\nnon-expert users to interactively probe and explore the concept space to\nexplain model behavior at the instance/class/global level. The system was\ndeveloped via iterative prototyping to address a number of design challenges\nthat non-experts face in interpreting the behavior of deep learning models. Via\na rigorous user study, we validate how ConceptExplainer supports these\nchallenges. Likewise, we conduct a series of usage scenarios to demonstrate how\nthe system supports the interactive analysis of model behavior across a variety\nof tasks and explanation granularities, such as identifying concepts that are\nimportant to classification, identifying bias in training data, and\nunderstanding how concepts can be shared across diverse and seemingly\ndissimilar classes.",

    "title": "Almost-Linear Planted Cliques Elude the Metropolis Process",
    "abstract": "A seminal work of Jerrum (1992) showed that large cliques elude the\nMetropolis process. More specifically, Jerrum showed that the Metropolis\nalgorithm cannot find a clique of size $k=\\Theta(n^{\\alpha}), \\alpha \\in\n(0,1/2)$, which is planted in the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi random graph $G(n,1/2)$,\nin polynomial time. Information theoretically it is possible to find such\nplanted cliques as soon as $k \\ge (2+\\epsilon) \\log n$.\nSince the work of Jerrum, the computational problem of finding a planted\nclique in $G(n,1/2)$ was studied extensively and many polynomial time\nalgorithms were shown to find the planted clique if it is of size $k =\n\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$, while no polynomial-time algorithm is known to work when\n$k=o(\\sqrt{n})$. Notably, the first evidence of the problem's algorithmic\nhardness is commonly attributed to the result of Jerrum from 1992.\nIn this paper we revisit the original Metropolis algorithm suggested by\nJerrum. Interestingly, we find that the Metropolis algorithm actually fails to\nrecover a planted clique of size $k=\\Theta(n^{\\alpha})$ for any constant $0\n\\leq \\alpha < 1$.\nMoreover, we strengthen Jerrum's results in a number of other ways including:\nLike many results in the MCMC literature, the result of Jerrum shows that there\nexists a starting state (which may depend on the instance) for which the\nMetropolis algorithm fails. For a wide range of temperatures, we show that the\nalgorithm fails when started at the most natural initial state, which is the\nempty clique. This answers an open problem stated in Jerrum (1992). We also\nshow that the simulated tempering version of the Metropolis algorithm, a more\nsophisticated temperature-exchange variant of it, also fails at the same regime\nof parameters.\nFinally, our results confirm recent predictions by Gamarnik and Zadik (2019)\nand Angelini, Fachin, de Feo (2021).",

    "abstract": "Some of the most severe bottlenecks preventing widespread development of\nmachine learning models for human behavior include a dearth of labeled training\ndata and difficulty of acquiring high quality labels. Active learning is a\nparadigm for using algorithms to computationally select a useful subset of data\npoints to label using metrics for model uncertainty and data similarity. We\nexplore active learning for naturalistic computer vision emotion data, a\nparticularly heterogeneous and complex data space due to inherently subjective\nlabels. Using frames collected from gameplay acquired from a therapeutic\nsmartphone game for children with autism, we run a simulation of active\nlearning using gameplay prompts as metadata to aid in the active learning\nprocess. We find that active learning using information generated during\ngameplay slightly outperforms random selection of the same number of labeled\nframes. We next investigate a method to conduct active learning with subjective\ndata, such as in affective computing, and where multiple crowdsourced labels\ncan be acquired for each image. Using the Child Affective Facial Expression\n(CAFE) dataset, we simulate an active learning process for crowdsourcing many\nlabels and find that prioritizing frames using the entropy of the crowdsourced\nlabel distribution results in lower categorical cross-entropy loss compared to\nrandom frame selection. Collectively, these results demonstrate pilot\nevaluations of two novel active learning approaches for subjective affective\ndata collected in noisy settings.",

    "abstract": "Designing a safe and human-like decision-making system for an autonomous\nvehicle is a challenging task. Generative imitation learning is one possible\napproach for automating policy-building by leveraging both real-world and\nsimulated decisions. Previous work that applies generative imitation learning\nto autonomous driving policies focuses on learning a low-level controller for\nsimple settings. However, to scale to complex settings, many autonomous driving\nsystems combine fixed, safe, optimization-based low-level controllers with\nhigh-level decision-making logic that selects the appropriate task and\nassociated controller. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap in\ncomplexity by employing Safety-Aware Hierarchical Adversarial Imitation\nLearning (SHAIL), a method for learning a high-level policy that selects from a\nset of low-level controller instances in a way that imitates low-level driving\ndata on-policy. We introduce an urban roundabout simulator that controls\nnon-ego vehicles using real data from the Interaction dataset.

Most modern day navigation systems (e.g,\nGoogle maps, Waze, Garmin) are not designed to personalize their low-level\ninteractions for individual users across a wide range of driving styles (e.g.,\nvehicle type, reaction time, level of expertise). Towards the development of\npersonalized navigation systems that adapt to a variety of driving styles, we\npropose an online no-regret model-based RL method that quickly conforms to the\ndynamics of the current user. As the user interacts with it, the navigation\nsystem quickly builds a user-specific model, from which navigation commands are\noptimized using model predictive control. By personalizing the policy in this\nway, our method is able to give well-timed driving instructions that match the\nuser's dynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that our method is a no-regret\nalgorithm and we provide the convergence rate in the agnostic setting.

    "abstract": "PICNet pioneered the generation of multiple and diverse results for image\ncompletion task, but it required a careful balance between $\\mathcal{KL}$ loss\n(diversity) and reconstruction loss (quality), resulting in a limited diversity\nand quality . Separately, iGPT-based architecture has been employed to infer\ndistributions in a discrete space derived from a pixel-level pre-clustered\npalette, which however cannot generate high-quality results directly. In this\nwork, we present a novel framework for pluralistic image completion that can\nachieve both high quality and diversity at much faster inference speed. The\ncore of our design lies in a simple yet effective code sharing mechanism that\nleads to a very compact yet expressive image representation in a discrete\nlatent domain. The compactness and the richness of the representation further\nfacilitate the subsequent deployment of a transformer to effectively learn how\nto composite and complete a masked image at the discrete code domain. Based on\nthe global context well-captured by the transformer and the available visual\nregions, we are able to sample all tokens simultaneously, which is completely\ndifferent from the prevailing autoregressive approach of iGPT-based works, and\nleads to more than 100$\\times$ faster inference speed. Experiments show that\nour framework is able to learn semantically-rich discrete codes efficiently and\nrobustly, resulting in much better image reconstruction quality.

    "abstract": "A dynamic set of size up to K is a set in which elements can be inserted and\ndeleted and which at any moment in its history has at most K elements. In\ndynamic matching in a bipartite graph, each element, when it is inserted in a\ndynamic subset of left nodes, makes a request to be matched with one of its\nneighbors, and the request has to be satisfied on-the-fly without knowing\nfuture insertions and deletions and without revoking past matchings. We\nconsider a relaxation of dynamic matching in which each matching can survive at\nmost T insertions, and a right node can be assigned to more than one node of\nthe dynamic set. We show that a bipartite graph satisfying the condition in\nHall Marriage Theorem up to K has fast T-surviving dynamic matching for dynamic\nsets of size up to K, in which every right node can be assigned to at most\nO(log(KT)) left nodes. Fast matching means that each matching is done in time\npoly(log N, log T, D), where N is the number of left nodes, and D is the left\ndegree. We obtain a similar result for epsilon-rich matching, in which a left\nnode needs to be assigned (1-epsilon) fraction of its neighbors. By taking\nO(log (KT)) clones of the right set, one obtains T-surviving dynamic standard\nmatching (with no sharing of right nodes). We construct explicit bipartite\ngraphs admitting T-surviving dynamic matching up to K with small left degree D\nand small right set R, and similarly for $\\epsilon$-rich matching.\nSpecifically, D and |R|/K are polynomial in log N and log T, and for\n$\\epsilon$-rich the dependency is quasipolynomial. Previous constructions, both\nnon-explicit and explicit, did not require the T-surviving restriction, but had\nonly slow matching algorithms running in time exponential in K log N. We give\ntwo applications. The first one is in the area of non-blocking networks, and\nthe second one is about one-probe storage schemes for dynamic sets.",

This work explores a\nnew intriguing direction: training a stylized implicit representation, using a\ngeneralized approach that can apply to various 2D and 3D scenarios. We conduct\na pilot study on a variety of implicit functions, including 2D coordinate-based\nrepresentation, neural radiance field, and signed distance function. Our\nsolution is a Unified Implicit Neural Stylization framework, dubbed INS. In\ncontrary to vanilla implicit representation, INS decouples the ordinary\nimplicit function into a style implicit module and a content implicit module,\nin order to separately encode the representations from the style image and\ninput scenes. An amalgamation module is then applied to aggregate these\ninformation and synthesize the stylized output. To regularize the geometry in\n3D scenes, we propose a novel self-distillation geometry consistency loss which\npreserves the geometry fidelity of the stylized scenes. Comprehensive\nexperiments are conducted on multiple task settings, including novel view\nsynthesis of complex scenes, stylization for implicit surfaces, and fitting\nimages using MLPs. We further demonstrate that the learned representation is\ncontinuous not only spatially but also style-wise, leading to effortlessly\ninterpolating between different styles and generating images with new mixed\nstyles.

    "abstract": "With tremendous advancements in low-power embedded computing devices and\nremote sensing instruments, the traditional satellite image processing pipeline\nwhich includes an expensive data transfer step prior to processing data on the\nground is being replaced by on-board processing of captured data. This paradigm\nshift enables critical and time-sensitive analytic intelligence to be acquired\nin a timely manner on-board the satellite itself. However, at present, the\non-board processing of multi-spectral satellite images is limited to\nclassification and segmentation tasks. Extending this processing to its next\nlogical level, in this paper we propose a lightweight pipeline for on-board\npanoptic segmentation of multi-spectral satellite images. Panoptic segmentation\noffers major economic and environmental insights, ranging from yield estimation\nfrom agricultural lands to intelligence for complex military applications.\nNevertheless, the on-board intelligence extraction raises several challenges\ndue to the loss of temporal observations and the need to generate predictions\nfrom a single image sample. To address this challenge, we propose a multimodal\nteacher network based on a cross-modality attention-based fusion strategy to\nimprove the segmentation accuracy by exploiting data from multiple modes. We\nalso propose an online knowledge distillation framework to transfer the\nknowledge learned by this multi-modal teacher network to a uni-modal student\nwhich receives only a single frame input, and is more appropriate for an\non-board environment. We benchmark our approach against existing\nstate-of-the-art panoptic segmentation models using the PASTIS multi-spectral\npanoptic segmentation dataset considering an on-board processing setting.

    "abstract": "With the capacity of modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data,\ntransformers have shown remarkable performances in a variety of generative\ntasks such as image, audio, and text generation. Yet, taming them in generating\nless structured and voluminous data formats such as high-resolution point\nclouds have seldom been explored due to ambiguous sequentialization processes\nand infeasible computation burden. In this paper, we aim to further exploit the\npower of transformers and employ them for the task of 3D point cloud\ngeneration. The key idea is to decompose point clouds of one category into\nsemantically aligned sequences of shape compositions, via a learned canonical\nspace. These shape compositions can then be quantized and used to learn a\ncontext-rich composition codebook for point cloud generation. Experimental\nresults on point cloud reconstruction and unconditional generation show that\nour model performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore,\nour model can be easily extended to multi-modal shape completion as an\napplication for conditional shape generation.",

In this work, we propose a prompting-based approach to generate\nlabelled training data for intent classification with off-the-shelf language\nmodels (LMs) such as GPT-3. An advantage of this method is that no\ntask-specific LM-fine-tuning for data generation is required; hence the method\nrequires no hyper-parameter tuning and is applicable even when the available\ntraining data is very scarce. We evaluate the proposed method in a few-shot\nsetting on four diverse intent classification tasks. We find that GPT-generated\ndata significantly boosts the performance of intent classifiers when intents in\nconsideration are sufficiently distinct from each other. In tasks with\nsemantically close intents, we observe that the generated data is less helpful.\nOur analysis shows that this is because GPT often generates utterances that\nbelong to a closely-related intent instead of the desired one. We present\npreliminary evidence that a prompting-based GPT classifier could be helpful in\nfiltering the generated data to enhance its quality.",

    "abstract": "Deepfakes and manipulated media are becoming a prominent threat due to the\nrecent advances in realistic image and video synthesis techniques. There have\nbeen several attempts at combating Deepfakes using machine learning\nclassifiers. However, such classifiers do not generalize well to black-box\nimage synthesis techniques and have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial\nexamples. To address these challenges, we introduce a deep learning based\nsemi-fragile watermarking technique that allows media authentication by\nverifying an invisible secret message embedded in the image pixels. Instead of\nidentifying and detecting fake media using visual artifacts, we propose to\nproactively embed a semi-fragile watermark into a real image so that we can\nprove its authenticity when needed. Our watermarking framework is designed to\nbe fragile to facial manipulations or tampering while being robust to benign\nimage-processing operations such as image compression, scaling, saturation,\ncontrast adjustments etc. This allows images shared over the internet to retain\nthe verifiable watermark as long as face-swapping or any other Deepfake\nmodification technique is not applied. We demonstrate that FaceSigns can embed\na 128 bit secret as an imperceptible image watermark that can be recovered with\na high bit recovery accuracy at several compression levels, while being\nnon-recoverable when unseen Deepfake manipulations are applied. For a set of\nunseen benign and Deepfake manipulations studied in our work, FaceSigns can\nreliably detect manipulated content with an AUC score of 0.996 which is\nsignificantly higher than prior image watermarking and steganography\ntechniques.",

Under this constraint, prices for different allocations made by the\nmechanism must be subadditive implying that the price of a bundle cannot exceed\nthe sum of prices of individual items it contains. This natural constraint has\nenabled several positive results in multi-item mechanism design bypassing\nwell-established impossibility results.\nOur work addresses a main open question from this literature involving the\ndesign of buy-many mechanisms for multiple buyers. Our main result is that a\nsimple sequential item pricing mechanism with buyer-specific prices can achieve\nan $O(\\log m)$ approximation to the revenue of any buy-many mechanism when all\nbuyers have unit-demand preferences over $m$ items. This is the best possible\nas it directly matches the previous results for the single-buyer setting where\nno simple mechanism can obtain a better approximation. Our result applies in\nfull generality: even though there are many alternative ways buy-many\nmechanisms can be defined for multi-buyer settings, our result captures all of\nthem at the same time. We achieve this by directly competing with a more\npermissive upper-bound on the buy-many revenue, obtained via an ex-ante\nrelaxation.",

The joint UDUA problem is\ndecoupled into two sub-problems: one is the user association sub-problem, which\ngets the optimal matching strategy between aerial and ground nodes for certain\nUAV-BS positions; and the other is the UAV-BS deployment sub-problem trying to\nfind the best position combination of the UAV-BSs that make the solution of the\nfirst sub-problem optimal among all the possible position combinations of the\nUAV-BSs. In the proposed mechanism, we transform the user association\nsub-problem into an equivalent bipartite matching problem and solve it using\nthe Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. For the UAV-BS deployment sub-problem, we\ntheoretically prove that adopting the best UAV-BS deployment strategy of a\nprevious user distribution for each new user distribution will introduce little\nperformance decline compared with the new user distribution's ground true best\nstrategy if the two user distributions are similar enough. Based on our\nmathematical analyses, the similarity level between user distributions is well\ndefined and becomes the key to solve the second sub-problem.

Barring\nsynthetic or in-studio domains, acquiring such supervision for each new target\nenvironment is highly inconvenient. To this end, we cast 3D pose learning as a\nself-supervised adaptation problem that aims to transfer the task knowledge\nfrom a labeled source domain to a completely unpaired target. We propose to\ninfer image-to-pose via two explicit mappings viz. image-to-latent and\nlatent-to-pose where the latter is a pre-learned decoder obtained from a\nprior-enforcing generative adversarial auto-encoder. Next, we introduce\nrelation distillation as a means to align the unpaired cross-modal samples i.e.\nthe unpaired target videos and unpaired 3D pose sequences. To this end, we\npropose a new set of non-local relations in order to characterize long-range\nlatent pose interactions unlike general contrastive relations where positive\ncouplings are limited to a local neighborhood structure. Further, we provide an\nobjective way to quantify non-localness in order to select the most effective\nrelation set.

Besides, most PT methods still rely on the\ndecisions of security experts. Addressing the challenges, for the first time,\nwe introduce expert knowledge to guide the agent to make better decisions in\nRL-based PT and propose a Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning-based\ngeneric intelligent Penetration testing framework, denoted as GAIL-PT, to solve\nthe problems of higher labor costs due to the involvement of security experts\nand high-dimensional discrete action space.

Second, we\ninput the expert knowledge and the state-action pairs generated online by the\ndifferent RL / DRL models into the discriminator of GAIL for training. At last,\nwe apply the output reward of the discriminator to guide the agent to perform\nthe action with a higher penetration success rate to improve PT's performance.\nExtensive experiments conducted on the real target host and simulated network\nscenarios show that GAIL-PT achieves the SOTA penetration performance against\nDeepExploit in exploiting actual target Metasploitable2 and Q-learning in\noptimizing penetration path, not only in small-scale with or without honey-pot\nnetwork environments but also in the large-scale virtual network environment.",

However, despite the extensive impacts of methods such as receding\nhorizon control, dynamic programming and reinforcement learning, the design of\ncost functions for a particular system often remains a heuristic-driven process\nof trial and error. In this paper we seek to gain insights into how the choice\nof cost function interacts with the underlying structure of the control system\nand impacts the amount of computation required to obtain a stabilizing\ncontroller. We treat the cost design problem as a two-step process where the\ndesigner specifies outputs for the system that are to be penalized and then\nmodulates the relative weighting of the inputs and the outputs in the cost. We\nthen bound the length of the prediction horizon $T>0$ that is required for\nreceding horizon control methods to stabilize the system as a concrete way of\ncharacterizing the computational difficulty of stabilizing the system using the\nchosen cost function. Drawing on insights from the `cheap control' literature,\nwe investigate cases where the chosen outputs lead to minimumphase and\nnon-minimumphase input-output dynamics. When the system is minimumphase, the\nprediction horizon needed to ensure stability can be made arbitrarily small by\nmaking the penalty on the control small enough. This indicates that choices of\ncost function which implicitly induce minimumphase behavior lead to an optimal\ncontrol problem from which it is `easy' to obtain a stabilizing controller.\nUsing these insights, we investigate empirically how the choice of cost\nfunction affects the ability of modern reinforcement learning algorithms to\nlearn a stabilizing controller. Taken together, the results in this paper\nindicate that cost functions which induce non-minimum phase behavior lead to\ninherent computational difficulties.",

    "title": "Towards Security-Optimized Placement of ADS-B Sensors",
    "abstract": "Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) sensors deployed on the\nground are central to observing aerial movements of aircraft. Their\nunsystematic placement, however, results in over-densification of sensor\ncoverage in some areas and insufficient sensor coverage in other areas. ADS-B\nsensor coverage has so far been recognized and analyzed as an availability\nproblem; it was tackled by sensor placement optimization techniques that aim\nfor covering large enough areas. In this paper, we demonstrate that the\nunsystematic placement of ADS-B sensors leads to a security problem, since the\nrealization and possible deployment of protective mechanisms is closely linked\nto aspects of redundancy in ADS-B sensor coverage. In particular, we model\nADS-B sensor coverage as a multi-dimensional security problem. We then use\nmulti-objective optimization techniques to tackle this problem and derive\nsecurity-optimized near-optimal placement solutions. Our results show how the\nlocation of sensors play a significant role in reducing the success rate of\nattackers by providing a sufficient number of sensors within a specific\ngeographical area to verify location claims and reducing the exposure to\njamming attacks.",

In such models, the so-called micro-behaviors describing how the user\nlocates an item and carries out various activities on it (e.g., click,\nadd-to-cart, and read-comments), are simply ignored. A few recent studies have\ntried to incorporate the sequential patterns of micro-behaviors into SR models.\nHowever, those sequential models still cannot effectively capture all the\ninherent interdependencies between micro-behavior operations. In this work, we\naim to investigate the effects of the micro-behavior information in SR\nsystematically. Specifically, we identify two different patterns of\nmicro-behaviors: \"sequential patterns\" and \"dyadic relational patterns\". To\nbuild a unified model of user micro-behaviors, we first devise a multigraph to\naggregate the sequential patterns from different items via a graph neural\nnetwork, and then utilize an extended self-attention network to exploit the\npair-wise relational patterns of micro-behaviors.

To overcome the limitations that restrict such\napplications, the development of a comprehensive computing paradigm has\ngarnered attention in both academia and industry. However, a gap exists in the\nliterature owing to the scarce research, and a comprehensive computing paradigm\nis yet to be systematically designed and reviewed.

To this end, we are the first to study what\ninformation FC models consider sufficient by introducing a novel task and\nadvancing it with three main contributions. First, we conduct an in-depth\nempirical analysis of the task with a new fluency-preserving method for\nomitting information from the evidence at the constituent and sentence level.\nWe identify when models consider the remaining evidence (in)sufficient for FC,\nbased on three trained models with different Transformer architectures and\nthree FC datasets. Second, we ask annotators whether the omitted evidence was\nimportant for FC, resulting in a novel diagnostic dataset, SufficientFacts, for\nFC with omitted evidence. We find that models are least successful in detecting\nmissing evidence when adverbial modifiers are omitted (21% accuracy), whereas\nit is easiest for omitted date modifiers (63% accuracy). Finally, we propose a\nnovel data augmentation strategy for contrastive self-learning of missing\nevidence by employing the proposed omission method combined with tri-training.\nIt improves performance for Evidence Sufficiency Prediction by up to 17.8 F1\nscore, which in turn improves FC performance by up to 2.6 F1 score.",

    "abstract": "Recent deep learning-based video salient object detection (VSOD) has achieved\nsome breakthrough, but these methods rely on expensive annotated videos with\npixel-wise annotations, weak annotations, or part of the pixel-wise\nannotations. In this paper, based on the similarities and the differences\nbetween VSOD and image salient object detection (SOD), we propose a novel VSOD\nmethod via a progressive framework that locates and segments salient objects in\nsequence without utilizing any video annotation. To use the knowledge learned\nin the SOD dataset for VSOD efficiently, we introduce dynamic saliency to\ncompensate for the lack of motion information of SOD during the locating\nprocess but retain the same fine segmenting process. Specifically, an algorithm\nfor generating spatiotemporal location labels, which consists of generating\nhigh-saliency location labels and tracking salient objects in adjacent frames,\nis proposed. Based on these location labels, a two-stream locating network that\nintroduces an optical flow branch for video salient object locating is\npresented. Although our method does not require labeled video at all, the\nexperimental results on five public benchmarks of DAVIS, FBMS, ViSal, VOS, and\nDAVSOD demonstrate that our proposed method is competitive with fully\nsupervised methods and outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly and unsupervised\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPSS) denote a service-oriented (SO) way\nof providing access to CPS capabilities. The design of such systems bears high\nrisk due to uncertainty in requirements related to service function and\nbehavior, operation environments, and evolving customer needs. Such risks and\nuncertainties are well known in the IT sector, where DevOps principles ensure\ncontinuous system improvement through reliable and frequent delivery processes.\nA modular and SO system architecture complements these processes to facilitate\nIT system adaptation and evolution. This work proposes a method to use and\nextend the Digital Twins (DTs) of IPSS assets for enabling the continuous\noptimization of CPS service delivery and the latter's adaptation to changing\nneeds and environments. This reduces uncertainty during design and operations\nby assuring IPSS integrity and availability, especially for design and service\nadaptations at CPS runtime. The method builds on transferring IT DevOps\nprinciples to DT-enabled CPS IPSS. The chosen design approach integrates,\nreuses, and aligns the DT processing and communication resources with DevOps\nrequirements derived from literature. We use these requirements to propose a\nDT-enabled self-adaptive CPS model, which guides the realization of DT-enabled\nDevOps in CPS IPSS. We further propose detailed design models for\noperation-critical DTs that integrate CPS closed-loop control and\narchitecture-based CPS adaptation. This integrated approach enables the\nimplementation of A/B testing as a use case and central concept to enable CPS\nIPSS service adaptation and reconfiguration. The self-adaptive CPS model and DT\ndesign concept have been validated in an evaluation environment for\noperation-critical CPS IPSS.

    "abstract": "Recently, parallel text generation has received widespread attention due to\nits success in generation efficiency. Although many advanced techniques are\nproposed to improve its generation quality, they still need the help of an\nautoregressive model for training to overcome the one-to-many multi-modal\nphenomenon in the dataset, limiting their applications. In this paper, we\npropose $\\textit{latent}$-GLAT, which employs the discrete latent variables to\ncapture word categorical information and invoke an advanced curriculum learning\ntechnique, alleviating the multi-modality problem. Experiment results show that\nour method outperforms strong baselines without the help of an autoregressive\nmodel, which further broadens the application scenarios of the parallel\ndecoding paradigm.",

The use of kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD)\nyields an alternative non-parametric approach to compare two populations by\nfinding the maximum mean difference generated by measurable functions in the\nunit ball in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Predicated on the\nuniversal approximation of universal kernels, we propose two corresponding\nclasses of functions in a RKHS that can bound the KL divergence from below and\nabove, and derive the RKHS representations of these bounds.

To address this issue, an efficient real-time target\ntracking method based on a low-dimension adaptive feature fusion is proposed to\nallow us the simultaneous implementation of the high-accuracy and real-time\ntarget tracking. First, the adaptive fusion of a histogram of oriented gradient\n(HOG) feature and color feature is utilized to improve the tracking accuracy.\nSecond, a convolution dimension reduction method applies to the fusion between\nthe HOG feature and color feature to reduce the over-fitting caused by their\nhigh-dimension fusions. Third, an average correlation energy estimation method\nis used to extract the relative confidence adaptive coefficients to ensure\ntracking accuracy. We experimentally confirm the proposed method on an OTB100\ndata set. Compared with nine popular target tracking algorithms, the proposed\nalgorithm gains the highest tracking accuracy and success tracking rate.\nCompared with the traditional Sum of Template and Pixel-wise LEarners (STAPLE)\nalgorithm, the proposed algorithm can obtain a higher success rate and\naccuracy, improving by 0.023 and 0.019, respectively. The experimental results\nalso demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reach the real-time target\ntracking with 50 fps.

Typical GPU\nimplementations have a loop on the host side that invokes the GPU kernel as\nmuch as time/algorithm steps there are. The termination of each kernel\nimplicitly acts as the barrier required after advancing the solution every time\nstep. We propose a scheme for running memory-bound iterative GPU kernels:\nPERsistent KernelS (PERKS).

    "abstract": "The paradigm of worst-group loss minimization has shown its promise in\navoiding to learn spurious correlations, but requires costly additional\nsupervision on spurious attributes. To resolve this, recent works focus on\ndeveloping weaker forms of supervision -- e.g., hyperparameters discovered with\na small number of validation samples with spurious attribute annotation -- but\nnone of the methods retain comparable performance to methods using full\nsupervision on the spurious attribute. In this paper, instead of searching for\nweaker supervisions, we ask: Given access to a fixed number of samples with\nspurious attribute annotations, what is the best achievable worst-group loss if\nwe \"fully exploit\" them? To this end, we propose a pseudo-attribute-based\nalgorithm, coined Spread Spurious Attribute (SSA), for improving the\nworst-group accuracy. In particular, we leverage samples both with and without\nspurious attribute annotations to train a model to predict the spurious\nattribute, then use the pseudo-attribute predicted by the trained model as\nsupervision on the spurious attribute to train a new robust model having\nminimal worst-group loss. Our experiments on various benchmark datasets show\nthat our algorithm consistently outperforms the baseline methods using the same\nnumber of validation samples with spurious attribute annotations. We also\ndemonstrate that the proposed SSA can achieve comparable performances to\nmethods using full (100%) spurious attribute supervision, by using a much\nsmaller number of annotated samples -- from 0.6% and up to 1.5%, depending on\nthe dataset.",

    "title": "The number of extended irreducible binary Goppa codes",
    "abstract": "Goppa, in the 1970s, discovered the relation between algebraic geometry and\ncodes, which led to the family of Goppa codes. As one of the most interesting\nsubclasses of linear codes, the family of Goppa codes is often chosen as a key\nin the McEliece cryptosystem. Knowledge of the number of inequivalent binary\nGoppa codes for fixed parameters may facilitate in the evaluation of the\nsecurity of such a cryptosystem. Let $n\\geq5$ be an odd prime number, let\n$q=2^n$ and let $r\\geq3$ be a positive integer satisfying $\\gcd(r,n)=1$. The\npurpose of this paper is to establish an upper bound on the number of\ninequivalent extended irreducible binary Goppa codes of length $q+1$ and degree\n$r$.A potential mathematical object for this purpose is to count the number of\norbits of the projective semi-linear group ${\\rm\nPGL}_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)\\rtimes{\\rm Gal}(\\mathbb{F}_{q^r}/\\mathbb{F}_2)$ on the set\n$\\mathcal{I}_r$ of all monic irreducible polynomials of degree $r$ over the\nfinite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. An explicit formula for the number of orbits of\n${\\rm PGL}_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)\\rtimes{\\rm Gal}(\\mathbb{F}_{q^r}/\\mathbb{F}_2)$ on\n$\\mathcal{I}_r$ is given, and consequently, an upper bound for the number of\ninequivalent extended irreducible binary Goppa codes of length $q+1$ and degree\n$r$ is derived. Our main result naturally contains the main results of Ryan\n(IEEE-TIT 2015), Huang and Yue (IEEE-TIT, 2022) and, Chen and Zhang (IEEE-TIT,\n2022), which considered the cases $r=4$, $r=6$ and $\\gcd(r,q^3-q)=1$\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging has attracted significant attention to identify\nspectral signatures for image classification and automated pattern recognition\nin computer vision. State-of-the-art implementations of snapshot hyperspectral\nimaging rely on bulky, non-integrated, and expensive optical elements,\nincluding lenses, spectrometers, and filters. These macroscopic components do\nnot allow fast data processing for, e.g real-time and high-resolution videos.\nThis work introduces Hyplex, a new integrated architecture addressing the\nlimitations discussed above. Hyplex is a CMOS-compatible, fast hyperspectral\ncamera that replaces bulk optics with nanoscale metasurfaces inversely designed\nthrough artificial intelligence. Hyplex does not require spectrometers but\nmakes use of conventional monochrome cameras, opening up the possibility for\nreal-time and high-resolution hyperspectral imaging at inexpensive costs.\nHyplex exploits a model-driven optimization, which connects the physical\nmetasurfaces layer with modern visual computing approaches based on end-to-end\ntraining. We design and implement a prototype version of Hyplex and compare its\nperformance against the state-of-the-art for typical imaging tasks such as\nspectral reconstruction and semantic segmentation. In all benchmarks, Hyplex\nreports the smallest reconstruction error. We additionally present what is, to\nthe best of our knowledge, the largest publicly available labeled hyperspectral\ndataset for semantic segmentation.",

Our approach is based on determining if the\nlips motion and the voice in a video are synchronised or not, depending on\ntheir audio-visual correspondence score. We propose an audio-visual cross-modal\ntransformer-based model that outperforms several baseline models in the\naudio-visual synchronisation task on the standard lip-reading speech benchmark\ndataset LRS2. While the existing methods focus mainly on the lip\nsynchronisation in speech videos, we also consider the special case of singing\nvoice. Singing voice is a more challenging use case for synchronisation due to\nsustained vowel sounds. We also investigate the relevance of lip\nsynchronisation models trained on speech datasets in the context of singing\nvoice. Finally, we use the frozen visual features learned by our lip\nsynchronisation model in the singing voice separation task to outperform a\nbaseline audio-visual model which was trained end-to-end.

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation is vital for scene understanding and downstream\ntasks. We focus on the supervised setup, in which ground-truth depth is\navailable only at training time. Based on knowledge about the high regularity\nof real 3D scenes, we propose a method that learns to selectively leverage\ninformation from coplanar pixels to improve the predicted depth. In particular,\nwe introduce a piecewise planarity prior which states that for each pixel,\nthere is a seed pixel which shares the same planar 3D surface with the former.\nMotivated by this prior, we design a network with two heads. The first head\noutputs pixel-level plane coefficients, while the second one outputs a dense\noffset vector field that identifies the positions of seed pixels. The plane\ncoefficients of seed pixels are then used to predict depth at each position.\nThe resulting prediction is adaptively fused with the initial prediction from\nthe first head via a learned confidence to account for potential deviations\nfrom precise local planarity. The entire architecture is trained end-to-end\nthanks to the differentiability of the proposed modules and it learns to\npredict regular depth maps, with sharp edges at occlusion boundaries. An\nextensive evaluation of our method shows that we set the new state of the art\nin supervised monocular depth estimation, surpassing prior methods on NYU\nDepth-v2 and on the Garg split of KITTI.

We\nstudy the classical setting of dynamic geometric streams, where the clients are\npresented as a sequence of insertions and deletions of points in the grid\n$\\{1,\\ldots,\\Delta\\}^d$, and we focus on the high-dimensional regime, where the\nalgorithm's space complexity must be polynomial (and certainly not exponential)\nin $d\\cdot\\log\\Delta$.\nWe present a new algorithmic framework, based on importance sampling from the\nstream, for $O(1)$-approximation of the optimal cost using only\n$\\mathrm{poly}(d\\cdot\\log\\Delta)$ space. This framework is easy to implement in\ntwo passes, one for sampling points and the other for estimating their\ncontribution.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to enhance the generalization\ncapability of a certain model from a source domain to a target domain. Present\nUDA models focus on alleviating the domain shift by minimizing the feature\ndiscrepancy between the source domain and the target domain but usually ignore\nthe class confusion problem. In this work, we propose an Inter-class Separation\nand Intra-class Aggregation (ISIA) mechanism. It encourages the cross-domain\nrepresentative consistency between the same categories and differentiation\namong diverse categories. In this way, the features belonging to the same\ncategories are aligned together and the confusable categories are separated. By\nmeasuring the align complexity of each category, we design an Adaptive-weighted\nInstance Matching (AIM) strategy to further optimize the instance-level\nadaptation. Based on our proposed methods, we also raise a hierarchical\nunsupervised domain adaptation framework for cross-domain semantic segmentation\ntask. Through performing the image-level, feature-level, category-level and\ninstance-level alignment, our method achieves a stronger generalization\nperformance of the model from the source domain to the target domain. In two\ntypical cross-domain semantic segmentation tasks, i.e., GTA5 to Cityscapes and\nSYNTHIA to Cityscapes, our method achieves the state-of-the-art segmentation\naccuracy. We also build two cross-domain semantic segmentation datasets based\non the publicly available data, i.e., remote sensing building segmentation and\nroad segmentation, for domain adaptive segmentation.",

Given matrices $A$, $B$, and $G$ of compatible\ndimensions, such a decomposition provides a coordinated low-rank approximation\nof the three matrices using a subset of their rows and columns. We pick the\nsubset of rows and columns of the original matrices by applying either the\ndiscrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) or the L-DEIM scheme on the\northogonal and nonsingular matrices from the restricted singular value\ndecomposition of the matrix triplet. We investigate the connections between a\nDEIM type RSVD-CUR approximation and a DEIM type CUR factorization, and a DEIM\ntype generalized CUR decomposition.

    "abstract": "Session-based recommendation is a practical recommendation task that predicts\nthe next item based on an anonymous behavior sequence, and its performance\nrelies heavily on the transition information between items in the sequence. The\nSOTA methods in SBR employ GNN to model neighboring item transitions from\nglobal (i.e, other sessions) and local (i.e, current session) contexts.\nHowever, most existing methods treat neighbors from different sessions equally\nwithout considering that the neighbor items from different sessions may share\nsimilar features with the target item on different aspects and may have\ndifferent contributions. In other words, they have not explored\nfiner-granularity transition information between items in the global context,\nleading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we fill this gap by\nproposing a novel Transition Information Enhanced Disentangled Graph Neural\nNetwork (TIE-DGNN) model to capture finer-granular transition information\nbetween items and try to interpret the reason of the transition by modeling the\nvarious factors of the item. Specifically, we propose a position-aware global\ngraph, which utilizes the relative position information to model the\nneighboring item transition. Then, we slice item embeddings into blocks, each\nof which represents a factor, and use disentangling module to separately learn\nthe factor embeddings over the global graph. For local context, we train item\nembeddings by using attention mechanisms to capture transition information from\nthe current session. To this end, our model considers two levels of transition\ninformation. Especially in global text, we not only consider finer-granularity\ntransition information between items but also take user intents at factor-level\ninto account to interpret the key reason for the transition.

    "abstract": "Humans like to express their opinions and crave the opinions of others.\nMining and detecting opinions from various sources are beneficial to\nindividuals, organisations, and even governments. One such organisation is news\nmedia, where a general norm is not to showcase opinions from their side.\nAnchors are the face of the digital media, and it is required for them not to\nbe opinionated. However, at times, they diverge from the accepted norm and\ninsert their opinions into otherwise straightforward news reports, either\npurposefully or unintentionally. This is primarily seen in debates as it\nrequires the anchors to be spontaneous, thus making them vulnerable to add\ntheir opinions. The consequence of such mishappening might lead to biased news\nor even supporting a certain agenda at the worst. To this end, we propose a\nnovel task of anchors' opinion detection in debates. We curate code-mixed news\ndebates and develop the ODIN dataset. A total of 2054 anchors' utterances in\nthe dataset are marked as opinionated or non-opinionated. Lastly, we propose\nDetONADe, an interactive attention-based framework for classifying anchors'\nutterances and obtain the best weighted-F1 score of 0.703. A thorough analysis\nand evaluation show many interesting patterns in the dataset and predictions.",

    "abstract": "With the expansion of the semiconductor supply chain, the use of recycled\nfield-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) has become a serious concern. Several\nmethods for detecting recycled FPGAs by analyzing the ring oscillator (RO)\nfrequencies have been proposed; however, most assume the known fresh FPGAs\n(KFFs) as the training data in machine-learning-based classification. In this\nstudy, we propose a novel recycled FPGA detection method based on an\nunsupervised anomaly detection scheme when there are few or no KFFs available.\nAs the RO frequencies in the neighboring logic blocks on an FPGA are similar\nbecause of systematic process variation, our method compares the RO frequencies\nand does not require KFFs. The proposed method efficiently identifies recycled\nFPGAs through outlier detection using direct density ratio estimation.\nExperiments using Xilinx Artix-7 FPGAs demonstrate that the proposed method\nsuccessfully distinguishes recycled FPGAs from 35 fresh FPGAs. In contrast, a\nconventional recycled FPGA detection method results in certain\nmisclassification.",

In order to achieve the optimized performance of\nthe EMG-based controller, our main strategy of classifier design is to reduce\nthe false movements of the overall system (when the EMG-based controller is at\nthe `Rest' position). To this end, unlike the traditional single training\nobjective of soft margin kernelized SVM, we have formulated the training\nalgorithm of the proposed supervised learning system as a general constrained\nmulti-objective optimization problem.

Part of\nits success is based on the fact that natural deduction rules present a simple\ncharacterization of logical constants, especially in the case of intuitionistic\nlogic. However, there has been a lot of criticism on extensions of the\nintuitionistic set of rules in order to deal with classical logic. Indeed, most\nof such extensions add, to the usual introduction and elimination rules, extra\nrules governing negation. As a consequence, several meta-logical properties,\nthe most prominent one being harmony, are lost. Dag Prawitz proposed a natural\ndeduction ecumenical system, where classical logic and intuitionistic logic are\ncodified in the same system. In this system, the classical logician and the\nintuitionistic logician would share the universal quantifier, conjunction,\nnegation and the constant for the absurd, but they would each have their own\nexistential quantifier, disjunction and implication, with different meanings.\nPrawitz' main idea is that these different meanings are given by a semantical\nframework that can be accepted by both parties. In this paper, we propose a\ndifferent approach adapting, to the natural deduction framework, Girard's\nmechanism of stoup. This will allow the definition of a pure harmonic natural\ndeduction system for the propositional fragment of Prawitz' ecumenical logic.",

Concretely, we propose a model-based bi-level\noptimization algorithm that updates the critics parameters such that the policy\nthat is learned with the updated critic gets closer to solving the\nmeta-training tasks. We illustrate that our algorithm leads to learned critics\nthat resemble the ground truth Q function for a given task. Finally, after\nmeta-training, the learned critic can be used to learn new policies for new\nunseen task and environment settings via model-free policy gradient\noptimization, without requiring a model. We present results that show the\ngeneralization capabilities of our learned critic to new tasks and dynamics\nwhen used to learn a new policy in a new scenario.",

The hope behind this approach was to identify human strategies, which\nwe can then mimic in an emotion-aware voice assistant.

Empirical results confirm that through\nlearning, agents significantly improve both system and individual performance,\ne.g., 40% offloading failure rate reduction, 32% communication overhead\nreduction, up to 38% computation resource savings in low contention, 18%\nutilization increase with reduced load variation in high contention, and\nimprovement in fairness. Results also confirm the algorithm's good convergence\nand generalization property in significantly different environments.",

This is an ill-posed\nproblem where standard optimisation yields unphysical inferences. We introduce\na training scheme that uses temperature data to adaptively train a\nneural-network surrogate to simulate the parametric forward model. This\napproach approximates forward and inverse solution together, by simultaneously\nidentifying an approximate posterior distribution over the Biot number, and\nweighting the forward training loss according to this approximation. Utilising\nrandom Chebyshev series, we outline how to approximate an arbitrary Gaussian\nprocess prior, and using the surrogate we apply Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)\nto efficiently sample from the corresponding posterior distribution. We derive\nconvergence of the surrogate posterior to the true posterior distribution in\nthe Hellinger metric as our adaptive loss function approaches zero.\nFurthermore, we describe how this surrogate-accelerated HMC approach can be\ncombined with a traditional PDE solver in a delayed-acceptance scheme to\na-priori control the posterior accuracy, thus overcoming a major limitation of\ndeep learning-based surrogate approaches, which do not achieve guaranteed\naccuracy a-priori due to their non-convex training. Biot number calculations\nare involved turbo-machinery design, which is safety critical and highly\nregulated, therefore it is important that our results have such mathematical\nguarantees. Our approach achieves fast mixing in high-dimensional parameter\nspaces, whilst retaining the convergence guarantees of a traditional PDE\nsolver, and without the burden of evaluating this solver for proposals that are\nlikely to be rejected.

Considering that information on acoustic\nscenes and sound events helps SED and ASC mutually, some researchers have\nproposed a joint analysis of acoustic scenes and sound events by multitask\nlearning (MTL). However, conventional works have not investigated in detail how\nacoustic scenes and sound events mutually benefit SED and ASC. We, therefore,\ninvestigate the impact of information on acoustic scenes and sound events on\nthe performance of SED and ASC by using domain adversarial training based on a\ngradient reversal layer (GRL) or model training with fake labels. Experimental\nresults obtained using the TUT Acoustic Scenes 2016/2017 and TUT Sound Events\n2016/2017 show that pieces of information on acoustic scenes and sound events\nare effectively used to detect sound events and classify acoustic scenes,\nrespectively. Moreover, upon comparing GRL- and fake-label-based methods with\nsingle-task-based ASC and SED methods, single-task-based methods are found to\nachieve better performance. This result implies that even when using\nsingle-task-based ASC and SED methods, information on acoustic scenes may be\nimplicitly utilized for SED and vice versa.",

These findings contradict earlier research which showed improved\nperformance in out-of-training distribution settings when compared to entangled\nrepresentations. Additionally, it is not clear if the reported failures are due\nto (a) encoders failing to map novel combinations to the proper regions of the\nlatent space or (b) novel combinations being mapped correctly but the\ndecoder/downstream process is unable to render the correct output for the\nunseen combinations. We investigate these alternatives by testing several\nmodels on a range of datasets and training settings. We find that (i) when\nmodels fail, their encoders also fail to map unseen combinations to correct\nregions of the latent space and (ii) when models succeed, it is either because\nthe test conditions do not exclude enough examples, or because excluded\ngenerative factors determine independent parts of the output image.

    "abstract": "While Visual Question Answering (VQA) has progressed rapidly, previous works\nraise concerns about robustness of current VQA models. In this work, we study\nthe robustness of VQA models from a novel perspective: visual context. We\nsuggest that the models over-rely on the visual context, i.e., irrelevant\nobjects in the image, to make predictions. To diagnose the model's reliance on\nvisual context and measure their robustness, we propose a simple yet effective\nperturbation technique, SwapMix. SwapMix perturbs the visual context by\nswapping features of irrelevant context objects with features from other\nobjects in the dataset. Using SwapMix we are able to change answers to more\nthan 45 % of the questions for a representative VQA model. Additionally, we\ntrain the models with perfect sight and find that the context over-reliance\nhighly depends on the quality of visual representations. In addition to\ndiagnosing, SwapMix can also be applied as a data augmentation strategy during\ntraining in order to regularize the context over-reliance. By swapping the\ncontext object features, the model reliance on context can be suppressed\neffectively. Two representative VQA models are studied using SwapMix: a\nco-attention model MCAN and a large-scale pretrained model LXMERT. Our\nexperiments on the popular GQA dataset show the effectiveness of SwapMix for\nboth diagnosing model robustness and regularizing the over-reliance on visual\ncontext.

In recent\nyears, a series of publications have studied and criticized Twitter's APIs and\nTwitter has partially adapted its existing data streams. The newest Twitter API\nfor Academic Research allows to \"access Twitter's real-time and historical\npublic data with additional features and functionality that support collecting\nmore precise, complete, and unbiased datasets.\" The main new feature of this\nAPI is the possibility of accessing the full archive of all historic Tweets. In\nthis article, we will take a closer look at the Academic API and will try to\nanswer two questions. First, are the datasets collected with the Academic API\ncomplete? Secondly, since Twitter's Academic API delivers historic Tweets as\nrepresented on Twitter at the time of data collection, we need to understand\nhow much data is lost over time due to Tweet and account removal from the\nplatform. Our work shows evidence that Twitter's Academic API can indeed create\n(almost) complete samples of Twitter data based on a wide variety of search\nterms. We also provide evidence that Twitter's data endpoint v2 delivers better\nsamples than the previously used endpoint v1.1. Furthermore, collecting Tweets\nwith the Academic API at the time of studying a phenomenon rather than creating\nlocal archives of stored Tweets, allows for a straightforward way of following\nTwitter's developer agreement. Finally, we will also discuss technical\nartifacts and implications of the Academic API.

    "abstract": "We propose a system displaying audience eye gaze and nod reactions for\nenhancing synchronous remote communication. Recently, we have had increasing\nopportunities to speak to others remotely. In contrast to offline situations,\nhowever, speakers often have difficulty observing audience reactions at once in\nremote communication, which makes them feel more anxious and less confident in\ntheir speeches. Recent studies have proposed methods of presenting various\naudience reactions to speakers. Since these methods require additional devices\nto measure audience reactions, they are not appropriate for practical\nsituations. Moreover, these methods do not present overall audience reactions.\nIn contrast, we design and develop CalmResponses, a browser-based system which\nmeasures audience eye gaze and nod reactions only with a built-in webcam and\ncollectively presents them to speakers. The results of our two user studies\nindicated that the number of fillers in speaker's speech decreases when\naudiences' eye gaze is presented, and their self-rating score increases when\naudiences' nodding is presented. Moreover, comments from audiences suggested\nbenefits of CalmResponses for them in terms of co-presence and privacy\nconcerns.",

As public sector agencies\nbegin to adopt ADS, it is critical that we understand workers' experiences with\nthese systems in practice. In this paper, we present findings from a series of\ninterviews and contextual inquiries at a child welfare agency, to understand\nhow they currently make AI-assisted child maltreatment screening decisions.\nOverall, we observe how workers' reliance upon the ADS is guided by (1) their\nknowledge of rich, contextual information beyond what the AI model captures,\n(2) their beliefs about the ADS's capabilities and limitations relative to\ntheir own, (3) organizational pressures and incentives around the use of the\nADS, and (4) awareness of misalignments between algorithmic predictions and\ntheir own decision-making objectives.

To further our understanding of\nthe impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter,\ndensely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language\nModel PaLM. We trained PaLM on 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways, a new ML\nsystem which enables highly efficient training across multiple TPU Pods. We\ndemonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art\nfew-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation\nbenchmarks. On a number of these tasks, PaLM 540B achieves breakthrough\nperformance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of\nmulti-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the\nrecently released BIG-bench benchmark. A significant number of BIG-bench tasks\nshowed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance\nsteeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. PaLM also has strong\ncapabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we\ndemonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks.

    "abstract": "On-demand mobility sharing, provided by one or several transportation network\ncompanies (TNCs), is realized by real-time optimization algorithms to connect\ntrips among tens of thousands of drivers and fellow passengers. In a market of\nmobility sharing comprised of TNCs, there are two competing principles, the\neconomies of network scale and the healthy competition between TNCs, which can\nlead to \"segmentation\" of market. To understand the substantiality and\nrelationship of the two competing principles, we need to answer how much\nefficiency loss is generated due to the segmentation of market, and which\nfactors are related to it. Here we show how four critical factors of market\nstructure and characteristics of mobility sharing services -- density of trips\n(thickness), maximum detour allowed for sharing (tightness), market shares\n(unevenness), and spatial segregation of the TNCs (dissolvedness) -- are\nassociated with the efficiency loss, represented as the difference in vehicle\nmiles traveled (VMT) under different market structures. We found that 1) while\nVMT shows a simple power function with thickness, the corresponding exponent\nterm can be expressed as a non-monotonic function with tightness -- essentially\nshowing how economies and diseconomies of scale in this market arise, and\nappearing a very similar form to the Lennard--Jones model in inter-molecular\npotentials; and 2) the efficiency loss is higher when unevenness is closer to\n0.5 (50-50 market share) and dissolvedness is larger. Our results give a\ncomprehensive analysis of how the inefficiency of market segmentation is\ngenerated, and how potentially it may be avoided through market mechanism\ndesign.",

While recent progress in imitation learning\nhas largely improved the sample efficiency compared to Reinforcement Learning,\nthe learned policy can hardly generalize to manipulate novel objects, given\nlimited expert demonstrations. In this paper, we propose to learn dexterous\nmanipulation using large-scale demonstrations with diverse 3D objects in a\ncategory, which are generated from a human grasp affordance model. This\ngeneralizes the policy to novel object instances within the same category. To\ntrain the policy, we propose a novel imitation learning objective jointly with\na geometric representation learning objective using our demonstrations. By\nexperimenting with relocating diverse objects in simulation, we show that our\napproach outperforms baselines with a large margin when manipulating novel\nobjects.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables edge devices to collaboratively learn a model\nin a distributed fashion. Many existing researches have focused on improving\ncommunication efficiency of high-dimensional models and addressing bias caused\nby local updates. However, most of FL algorithms are either based on reliable\ncommunications or assume fixed and known unreliability characteristics. In\npractice, networks could suffer from dynamic channel conditions and\nnon-deterministic disruptions, with time-varying and unknown characteristics.\nTo this end, in this paper we propose a sparsity enabled FL framework with both\ncommunication efficiency and bias reduction, termed as SAFARI. It makes novel\nuse of a similarity among client models to rectify and compensate for bias that\nis resulted from unreliable communications. More precisely, sparse learning is\nimplemented on local clients to mitigate communication overhead, while to cope\nwith unreliable communications, a similarity-based compensation method is\nproposed to provide surrogates for missing model updates. We analyze SAFARI\nunder bounded dissimilarity and with respect to sparse models. It is\ndemonstrated that SAFARI under unreliable communications is guaranteed to\nconverge at the same rate as the standard FedAvg with perfect communications.\nImplementations and evaluations on CIFAR-10 dataset validate the effectiveness\nof SAFARI by showing that it can achieve the same convergence speed and\naccuracy as FedAvg with perfect communications, with up to 80% of the model\nweights being pruned and a high percentage of client updates missing in each\nround.",

In this work we present YOLO-S, a simple, fast and efficient\nnetwork for small target detection.

To verify\nthe performances of YOLO-S, we build \"AIRES\", a novel dataset for cAr detectIon\nfRom hElicopter imageS acquired in Europe, and set up experiments on both AIRES\nand VEDAI datasets, benchmarking this architecture with four baseline\ndetectors. Furthermore, in order to handle efficiently the issue of data\ninsufficiency and domain gap when dealing with a transfer learning strategy, we\nintroduce a transitional learning task over a combined dataset based on DOTAv2\nand VEDAI and demonstrate that can enhance the overall accuracy with respect to\nmore general features transferred from COCO data. YOLO-S is from 25% to 50%\nfaster than YOLOv3 and only 15-25% slower than Tiny-YOLOv3, outperforming also\nYOLOv3 in terms of accuracy in a wide range of experiments. Further simulations\nperformed on SARD dataset demonstrate also its applicability to different\nscenarios such as for search and rescue operations.

For humans, rapid learning from examples can benefit from\nexplanations that connect examples to task principles. We therefore investigate\nwhether explanations of few-shot examples can allow language models to adapt\nmore effectively. We annotate a set of 40 challenging tasks from BIG-Bench with\nexplanations of answers to a small subset of questions, as well as a variety of\nmatched control explanations. We evaluate the effects of various zero-shot and\nfew-shot prompts that include different types of explanations, instructions,\nand controls on the performance of a range of large language models. We analyze\nthese results using statistical multilevel modeling techniques that account for\nthe nested dependencies among conditions, tasks, prompts, and models. We find\nthat explanations of examples can improve performance. Adding untuned\nexplanations to a few-shot prompt offers a modest improvement in performance;\nabout 1/3 the effect size of adding few-shot examples, but twice the effect\nsize of task instructions. We then show that explanations tuned for performance\non a small validation set offer substantially larger benefits; building a\nprompt by selecting examples and explanations together substantially improves\nperformance over selecting examples alone. Hand-tuning explanations can\nsubstantially improve performance on challenging tasks. Furthermore, even\nuntuned explanations outperform carefully matched controls, suggesting that the\nbenefits are due to the link between an example and its explanation, rather\nthan lower-level features of the language used.

In this paper, we improve significantly on\nSealfon's results, both for arbitrary weighted graphs and for bounded-weight\ngraphs on $n$ nodes. Specifically, we provide an approximate-DP algorithm that\noutputs all-pairs shortest path distances up to maximum additive error\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$, and a pure-DP algorithm that outputs all pairs shortest\npath distances up to maximum additive error $\\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ (where we\nignore dependencies on $\\varepsilon, \\delta$).

We also show that if the graph is promised to have reasonably\nbounded weights, one can improve the error further to roughly\n$n^{\\sqrt{2}-1+o(1)}$ in the approximate-DP setting and roughly\n$n^{(\\sqrt{17}-3)/2 + o(1)}$ in the pure-DP setting.

    "abstract": "On one hand, kinship is a universal human phenomenon that tends to align with\nbiological relatedness, which might suggest evolutionary foundations. On the\nother hand, kinship has exceptional variation across the human populations,\nwhich points to cultural foundations. Furthermore, even if its foundation was\nbiological, kinship is often too imprecise to track genetic relatedness\nefficiently, while inclusive fitness theory would suggest focusing only on the\nclosest relatives, which is not the case in most human cultures. It was the\nparallel validity of these contradicting arguments that led to decades of\nfierce debate about the definition and measurement of the phenomenon. This\npaper offers a new approach to kinship. First, the model demonstrates that it\nis possible to generate kinship networks (a) derived from the kind of basic kin\nconnections that our species shares with other apes, but (b) driven by network\nrather than biological logic beyond the immediate family. Second the model\ndemonstrates that kinship as a network heuristic works efficiently only in high\nfertility societies, and gives way to similarity-based friendship with\ndemographic transition. The results explain (i) why kinship labelling is unique\nto our species, (ii) why kinship is universal among human cultures, (iii) why\nkinship terminology systems are varied across cultures, (iv) why linguistic kin\nassignment is imprecise, and (v) why kinship is replaced by homophily when\nrelatives are scarce. The model offers a unifying framework to the debate\nbetween social and evolutionary anthropology concerning the concept of human\nkinship.",

However, we\nobserve that some powerful deep GNNs such as JKNet and DropEdge, can\neffectively exploit high-order neighbor information on other graph tasks but\nperform poorly on CF tasks, which conflicts with the explanation of these\nGNN-based CF research. Different from these research, we investigate the\nGNN-based CF from the perspective of Markov processes for distance learning\nwith a unified framework named Markov Graph Diffusion Collaborative Filtering\n(MGDCF). We design a Markov Graph Diffusion Network (MGDN) as MGDCF's GNN\nencoder, which learns vertex representations by trading off two types of\ndistances via a Markov process. We show the theoretical equivalence between\nMGDN's output and the optimal solution of a distance loss function, which can\nboost the optimization of CF models. MGDN can generalize state-of-the-art\nmodels such as LightGCN and APPNP, which are heterogeneous GNNs. In addition,\nMGDN can be extended to homogeneous GNNs with our sparsification technique. For\noptimizing MGDCF, we propose the InfoBPR loss function, which extends the\nwidely used BPR loss to exploit multiple negative samples for better\nperformance. We conduct experiments to perform detailed analysis on MGDCF. The\nsource code is publicly available at https://github.com/hujunxianligong/MGDCF.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating the performance of autonomous vehicles (AV) and their complex\nsubsystems to high precision under naturalistic circumstances remains a\nchallenge, especially when failure or dangerous cases are rare. Rarity does not\nonly require an enormous sample size for a naive method to achieve high\nconfidence estimation, but it also causes dangerous underestimation of the true\nfailure rate and it is extremely hard to detect. Meanwhile, the\nstate-of-the-art approach that comes with a correctness guarantee can only\ncompute an upper bound for the failure rate under certain conditions, which\ncould limit its practical uses. In this work, we present Deep Importance\nSampling (Deep IS) framework that utilizes a deep neural network to obtain an\nefficient IS that is on par with the state-of-the-art, capable of reducing the\nrequired sample size 43 times smaller than the naive sampling method to achieve\n10% relative error and while producing an estimate that is much less\nconservative. Our high-dimensional experiment estimating the misclassification\nrate of one of the state-of-the-art traffic sign classifiers further reveals\nthat this efficiency still holds true even when the target is very small,\nachieving over 600 times efficiency boost.

However, wind turbines regularly suffer from operational\ninconsistencies, leading to significant costs and challenges in operations and\nmaintenance (O&M).

Data-driven decision making techniques have\nwitnessed rapid evolution in the wind industry for such O&M tasks during the\nlast decade, from applying signal processing methods in early 2010 to\nartificial intelligence (AI) techniques, especially deep learning in 2020. In\nthis article, we utilise statistical computing to present a scientometric\nreview of the conceptual and thematic evolution of AI in the wind energy\nsector, providing evidence-based insights into present strengths and\nlimitations of data-driven decision making in the wind industry. We provide a\nperspective into the future and on current key challenges in data availability\nand quality, lack of transparency in black box-natured AI models, and\nprevailing issues in deploying models for real-time decision support, along\nwith possible strategies to overcome these problems.

The\nperformance of algorithms for pose estimation hinges on the robot's sensors\nbeing able to detect discriminative geometric object features, but previous\nsensing modalities are unable to make such measurements robustly. The robot's\nfingers can occlude the view of environment- or robot-mounted image sensors,\nand tactile sensors can only measure at the local areas of contact. Motivated\nby fingertip-embedded proximity sensors' robustness to occlusion and ability to\nmeasure beyond the local areas of contact, we present the first evaluation of\nproximity sensor based pose estimation for in-hand manipulation. We develop a\nnovel two-fingered hand with fingertip-embedded optical time-of-flight\nproximity sensors as a testbed for pose estimation during planar in-hand\nmanipulation. Here, the in-hand manipulation task consists of the robot moving\na cylindrical object from one end of its workspace to the other. We\ndemonstrate, with statistical significance, that proximity-sensor based pose\nestimation via particle filtering during in-hand manipulation: a) exhibits 50%\nlower average pose error than a tactile-sensor based baseline; b) empowers a\nmodel predictive controller to achieve 30% lower final positioning error\ncompared to when using tactile-sensor based pose estimates.",

Moreover, while clustering dynamical systems, it is imperative that\nthe dynamical nature of the underlying system is taken into account. In this\npaper, we propose a novel approach for clustering dynamical systems purely from\ntime-series data which inherently takes into account the dynamical evolution of\nthe underlying system. In particular, we define a \\emph{distance/similarity}\nmeasure between the states of the system which is a function of the influence\nthat the states have on each other, and use the proposed measure for clustering\nof the dynamical system. For data-driven computation we leverage the Koopman\noperator framework which takes into account the nonlinearities (if present) of\nthe underlying system, thus making the proposed framework applicable to a wide\nrange of application areas.

However, processing high-resolution inputs comes with high\ncomputation costs, and naive down-sampling of the input to reduce the\ncomputation costs quickly degrades the detection performance. In this paper, we\npropose SALISA, a novel non-uniform SALiency-based Input SAmpling technique for\nvideo object detection that allows for heavy down-sampling of unimportant\nbackground regions while preserving the fine-grained details of a\nhigh-resolution image. The resulting image is spatially smaller, leading to\nreduced computational costs while enabling a performance comparable to a\nhigh-resolution input. To achieve this, we propose a differentiable resampling\nmodule based on a thin plate spline spatial transformer network (TPS-STN).

Three reduction operations for alternating dimaps were\ninvestigated by Farr. A minor of an alternating dimap can be obtained by\nreducing some of its edges using the reduction operations. Unlike classical\nminor operations, these reduction operations do not commute in general. A Tutte\ninvariant for alternating dimaps is a function $ P $ defined on every\nalternating dimap and taking values in a field such that $ P $ is invariant\nunder isomorphism and obeys a linear recurrence relation involving reduction\noperations. It is well known that if a graph $ G $ is planar, then the Tutte\npolynomial $ T $ satisfies $ T(G;x,y)=T(G^{*};y,x) $. We note an analogous\nrelation for the extended Tutte invariants for alternating dimaps introduced by\nFarr. We then characterise the Tutte invariant for alternating dimaps of genus\nzero under several conditions. As a result of the non-commutativity of the\nreduction operations, the recursions based on them cannot always be satisfied.\nWe investigate the properties of alternating dimaps of genus zero that are\nrequired in order to obtain a well defined Tutte invariant.

    "abstract": "Accurately detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) and predicting mini-mental\nstate examination (MMSE) score are important tasks in elderly health by\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Most of the previous methods on these two\ntasks are based on single-task learning and rarely consider the correlation\nbetween them. Since the MMSE score, which is an important basis for AD\ndiagnosis, can also reflect the progress of cognitive impairment, some studies\nhave begun to apply multi-task learning methods to these two tasks. However,\nhow to exploit feature correlation remains a challenging problem for these\nmethods. To comprehensively address this challenge, we propose a MRI-based\nmulti-task decoupled learning method for AD detection and MMSE score\nprediction. First, a multi-task learning network is proposed to implement AD\ndetection and MMSE score prediction, which exploits feature correlation by\nadding three multi-task interaction layers between the backbones of the two\ntasks. Each multi-task interaction layer contains two feature decoupling\nmodules and one feature interaction module. Furthermore, to enhance the\ngeneralization between tasks of the features selected by the feature decoupling\nmodule, we propose the feature consistency loss constrained feature decoupling\nmodule. Finally, in order to exploit the specific distribution information of\nMMSE score in different groups, a distribution loss is proposed to further\nenhance the model performance. We evaluate our proposed method on multi-site\ndatasets. Experimental results show that our proposed multi-task decoupled\nrepresentation learning method achieves good performance, outperforming\nsingle-task learning and other existing state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Modern applications such as self-driving cars and drones rely heavily upon\nrobust object detection techniques. However, weather corruptions can hinder the\nobject detectability and pose a serious threat to their navigation and\nreliability. Thus, there is a need for efficient denoising, deraining, and\nrestoration techniques. Generative adversarial networks and transformers have\nbeen widely adopted for image restoration. However, the training of these\nmethods is often unstable and time-consuming. Furthermore, when used for object\ndetection (OD), the output images generated by these methods may provide\nunsatisfactory results despite image clarity. In this work, we propose a\ncontrastive approach towards mitigating this problem, by evaluating images\ngenerated by restoration models during and post training. This approach\nleverages OD scores combined with attention maps for predicting the usefulness\nof restored images for the OD task. We conduct experiments using two novel\nuse-cases of conditional GANs and two transformer methods that probe the\nrobustness of the proposed approach on multi-weather corruptions in the OD\ntask. Our approach achieves an averaged 178 percent increase in mAP between the\ninput and restored images under adverse weather conditions like dust tornadoes\nand snowfall. We report unique cases where greater denoising does not improve\nOD performance and conversely where noisy generated images demonstrate good\nresults.

    "abstract": "In many real world medical image classification settings we do not have\naccess to samples of all possible disease classes, while a robust system is\nexpected to give high performance in recognizing novel test data. We propose a\ngeneralized zero shot learning (GZSL) method that uses self supervised learning\n(SSL) for: 1) selecting anchor vectors of different disease classes; and 2)\ntraining a feature generator. Our approach does not require class attribute\nvectors which are available for natural images but not for medical images. SSL\nensures that the anchor vectors are representative of each class. SSL is also\nused to generate synthetic features of unseen classes. Using a simpler\narchitecture, our method matches a state of the art SSL based GZSL method for\nnatural images and outperforms all methods for medical images. Our method is\nadaptable enough to accommodate class attribute vectors when they are available\nfor natural images.",

    "abstract": "One challenging property lurking in medical datasets is the imbalanced data\ndistribution, where the frequency of the samples between the different classes\nis not balanced. Training a model on an imbalanced dataset can introduce unique\nchallenges to the learning problem where a model is biased towards the highly\nfrequent class. Many methods are proposed to tackle the distributional\ndifferences and the imbalanced problem. However, the impact of these approaches\non the learned features is not well studied. In this paper, we look deeper into\nthe internal units of neural networks to observe how handling data imbalance\naffects the learned features. We study several popular cost-sensitive\napproaches for handling data imbalance and analyze the feature maps of the\nconvolutional neural networks from multiple perspectives: analyzing the\nalignment of salient features with pathologies and analyzing the\npathology-related concepts encoded by the networks. Our study reveals\ndifferences and insights regarding the trained models that are not reflected by\nquantitative metrics such as AUROC and AP and show up only by looking at the\nmodels through a lens.",

    "abstract": "Fast noninvasive probing of spatially varying decorrelating events, such as\ncerebral blood flow beneath the human skull, is an essential task in various\nscientific and clinical settings. One of the primary optical techniques used is\ndiffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS), whose classical implementation uses a\nsingle or few single-photon detectors, resulting in poor spatial localization\naccuracy and relatively low temporal resolution. Here, we propose a technique\ntermed Classifying Rapid decorrelation Events via Parallelized single photon\ndEtection (CREPE)}, a new form of DCS that can probe and classify different\ndecorrelating movements hidden underneath turbid volume with high sensitivity\nusing parallelized speckle detection from a $32\\times32$ pixel SPAD array. We\nevaluate our setup by classifying different spatiotemporal-decorrelating\npatterns hidden beneath a 5mm tissue-like phantom made with rapidly\ndecorrelating dynamic scattering media. Twelve multi-mode fibers are used to\ncollect scattered light from different positions on the surface of the tissue\nphantom. To validate our setup, we generate perturbed decorrelation patterns by\nboth a digital micromirror device (DMD) modulated at multi-kilo-hertz rates, as\nwell as a vessel phantom containing flowing fluid. Along with a deep\ncontrastive learning algorithm that outperforms classic unsupervised learning\nmethods, we demonstrate our approach can accurately detect and classify\ndifferent transient decorrelation events (happening in 0.1-0.4s) underneath\nturbid scattering media, without any data labeling. This has the potential to\nbe applied to noninvasively monitor deep tissue motion patterns, for example\nidentifying normal or abnormal cerebral blood flow events, at multi-Hertz rates\nwithin a compact and static detection probe.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing promises to enhance machine learning and artificial\nintelligence. Different quantum algorithms have been proposed to improve a wide\nspectrum of machine learning tasks. Yet, recent theoretical works show that,\nsimilar to traditional classifiers based on deep classical neural networks,\nquantum classifiers would suffer from the vulnerability problem: adding tiny\ncarefully-crafted perturbations to the legitimate original data samples would\nfacilitate incorrect predictions at a notably high confidence level. This will\npose serious problems for future quantum machine learning applications in\nsafety and security-critical scenarios. Here, we report the first experimental\ndemonstration of quantum adversarial learning with programmable superconducting\nqubits. We train quantum classifiers, which are built upon variational quantum\ncircuits consisting of ten transmon qubits featuring average lifetimes of 150\n$\\mu$s, and average fidelities of simultaneous single- and two-qubit gates\nabove 99.94% and 99.4% respectively, with both real-life images (e.g., medical\nmagnetic resonance imaging scans) and quantum data. We demonstrate that these\nwell-trained classifiers (with testing accuracy up to 99%) can be practically\ndeceived by small adversarial perturbations, whereas an adversarial training\nprocess would significantly enhance their robustness to such perturbations. Our\nresults reveal experimentally a crucial vulnerability aspect of quantum\nlearning systems under adversarial scenarios and demonstrate an effective\ndefense strategy against adversarial attacks, which provide a valuable guide\nfor quantum artificial intelligence applications with both near-term and future\nquantum devices.",

    "abstract": "Emerging multi-material 3D printing techniques have paved the way for the\nrational design of metamaterials with not only complex geometries but also\narbitrary distributions of multiple materials within those geometries. Varying\nthe spatial distribution of multiple materials gives rise to many interesting\nand potentially unique combinations of anisotropic elastic properties. While\nthe availability of a design approach to cover a large portion of all possible\ncombinations of elastic properties is interesting in itself, it is even more\nimportant to find the extremely rare designs that lead to highly unusual\ncombinations of material properties (e.g., double-auxeticity and high elastic\nmoduli). Here, we used a random distribution of a hard phase and a soft phase\nwithin a regular lattice to study the resulting anisotropic mechanical\nproperties of the network in general and the abovementioned rare designs in\nparticular. The primary challenge to take up concerns the huge number of design\nparameters and the extreme rarity of such designs. We, therefore, used\ncomputational models and deep learning algorithms to create a mapping from the\nspace of design parameters to the space of mechanical properties, thereby (i)\nreducing the computational time required for evaluating each designand (ii)\nmaking the process of evaluating the different designs highly parallelizable.\nFurthermore, we selected ten designs to be fabricated using polyjet\nmulti-material 3D printing techniques, mechanically tested them, and\ncharacterized their behavior using digital image correlation (DIC, 3 designs)\nto validate the accuracy of our computational models. The results of our\nsimulations show that deep learning-based algorithms can accurately predict the\nmechanical properties of the different designs, which match the various\ndeformation mechanisms observed in the experiments.",

Many problems which were\nseverely limited using classical solutions are now seeing unprecedented\nsuccess. The rapid proliferation of deep learning methods has led to a sharp\nincrease in their use in consumer and embedded applications. One consequence of\nconsumer and embedded applications is lossy multimedia compression which is\nrequired to engineer the efficient storage and transmission of data in these\nreal-world scenarios. As such, there has been increased interest in a deep\nlearning solution for multimedia compression which would allow for higher\ncompression ratios and increased visual quality.\nThe deep learning approach to multimedia compression, so called Learned\nMultimedia Compression, involves computing a compressed representation of an\nimage or video using a deep network for the encoder and the decoder. While\nthese techniques have enjoyed impressive academic success, their industry\nadoption has been essentially non-existent. Classical compression techniques\nlike JPEG and MPEG are too entrenched in modern computing to be easily\nreplaced. This dissertation takes an orthogonal approach and leverages deep\nlearning to improve the compression fidelity of these classical algorithms.\nThis allows the incredible advances in deep learning to be used for multimedia\ncompression without threatening the ubiquity of the classical methods.\nThe key insight of this work is that methods which are motivated by first\nprinciples, i.e., the underlying engineering decisions that were made when the\ncompression algorithms were developed, are more effective than general methods.\nBy encoding prior knowledge into the design of the algorithm, the flexibility,\nperformance, and/or accuracy are improved at the cost of generality...",

This is mostly owing to the cost and technical difficulty of\nsynthesizing such computationally designed molecules. To overcome such\nbarriers, various methods for synthetic route design using deep neural networks\nhave been studied intensively in recent years. However, little progress has\nbeen made in designing molecules and their synthetic routes simultaneously.\nHere, we formulate the problem of simultaneously designing molecules with the\ndesired set of properties and their synthetic routes within the framework of\nBayesian inference. The design variables consist of a set of reactants in a\nreaction network and its network topology. The design space is extremely large\nbecause it consists of all combinations of purchasable reactants, often in the\norder of millions or more. In addition, the designed reaction networks can\nadopt any topology beyond simple multistep linear reaction routes. To solve\nthis hard combinatorial problem, we present a powerful sequential Monte Carlo\nalgorithm that recursively designs a synthetic reaction network by sequentially\nbuilding up single-step reactions. In a case study of designing drug-like\nmolecules based on commercially available compounds, compared with heuristic\ncombinatorial search methods, the proposed method shows overwhelming\nperformance in terms of computational efficiency and coverage and novelty with\nrespect to existing compounds.",

We introduce the concept of distance-restricted firefighting where\nthe firefighters' movement is restricted so they can only move up to some fixed\ndistance $d$ per turn rather than being able to move without restriction. We\nestablish some general properties of this new game in contrast to properties of\nthe original game, and we investigate specific cases of the distance-restricted\ngame on the infinite square, strong, and hexagonal grids. We conjecture that\ntwo firefighters are insufficient on the square grid when $d = 2$, and we pose\nsome questions about how many firefighters are required in general when $d =\n1$.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of designing a continuous time dynamical\nsystem to solve constrained nonlinear optimization problems such that the\nfeasible set is forward invariant and asymptotically stable. The invariance of\nthe feasible set makes the dynamics anytime, when viewed as an algorithm,\nmeaning that it is guaranteed to return a feasible solution regardless of when\nit is terminated. The system is obtained by augmenting the gradient flow of the\nobjective function with inputs, then designing a feedback controller to keep\nthe state evolution within the feasible set using techniques from the theory of\ncontrol barrier functions. The equilibria of the system correspond exactly to\ncritical points of the optimization problem. Since the state of the system\ncorresponds to the primal optimizer, and the steady-state input at equilibria\ncorresponds to the dual optimizer, the method can be interpreted as a\nprimal-dual approach. The resulting closed-loop system is locally Lipschitz\ncontinuous, so classical solutions to the system exist. We characterize\nconditions under which local minimizers are Lyapunov stable, drawing\nconnections between various constraint qualification conditions and the\nstability of the local minimizer. The algorithm is compared to other continuous\ntime methods for optimization.",

For an oriented graph $G$, let $\\beta(G)$ denote\nthe size of a minimum feedback arc set, a smallest subset of edges whose\ndeletion leaves an acyclic subgraph. A simple consequence of a result of Berger\nand Shor is that any oriented graph $G$ with $m$ edges satisfies $\\beta(G) =\nm/2 - \\Omega(m^{3/4})$.\nWe observe that if an oriented graph $G$ has a fixed forbidden subgraph $B$,\nthe upper bound of $\\beta(G) = m/2 - \\Omega(m^{3/4})$ is best possible as a\nfunction of the number of edges if $B$ is not bipartite, but the exponent $3/4$\nin the lower order term can be improved if $B$ is bipartite. We also show that\nfor every rational number $r$ between $3/4$ and $1$, there is a finite\ncollection of digraphs $\\mathcal{B}$ such that every $\\mathcal{B}$-free digraph\n$G$ with $m$ edges satisfies $\\beta(G) = m/2 - \\Omega(m^r)$, and this bound is\nbest possible up to the implied constant factor.

    "abstract": "On-demand mobility platforms play an increasingly important role in urban\nmobility systems. Impacts are still debated, as these platforms supply\npersonalized and optimized services, while also contributing to existing\nsustainability challenges. Recently, microtransit services have emerged,\npromising to combine advantages of pooled on-demand rides with more sustainable\nfixed-route public transit services. Understanding traveler behavior becomes a\nprimary focus to analyze adoption likelihood and perceptions of different\nmicrotransit attributes. The COVID-19 pandemic context adds an additional layer\nof complexity to analyzing mobility innovation acceptance. This study\ninvestigates the potential demand for microtransit options against the\nbackground of the pandemic. We use a stated choice experiment to study the\ndecision-making of Israeli public transit and car commuters when offered to use\nnovel microtransit options (sedan vs. passenger van). We investigate the\ntradeoffs related to traditional fare and travel time attributes, along with\nmicrotransit features; namely walking time to pickup location, vehicle sharing,\nwaiting time, minimum advanced reservation time, and shelter at designated\nboarding locations. Additionally, we analyze two latent constructs: attitudes\ntowards sharing, as well as experiences and risk-perceptions related to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. We develop Integrated Choice and Latent Variable models to\ncompare the two commuter groups in terms of the likelihood to switch to\nmicrotransit, attribute trade-offs, sharing preferences and pandemic impacts.\nThe results reveal high elasticities of several time and COVID effects for car\ncommuters compared to relative insensitivity of transit commuters to the risk\nof COVID contraction. Moreover, for car commuters, those with strong sharing\nidentities were more likely to be comfortable in COVID risk situations, and to\naccept microtransit.",

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been\ndemonstrated by the computer vision community to be successful at\nsuper-resolution problems, i.e., learning to add fine-scale structure to coarse\nimages.

The neural network must learn to add\nresolution and structure whilst accounting for non-negligible forecast error.\nWe show that GANs and VAE-GANs can match the statistical properties of\nstate-of-the-art pointwise post-processing methods whilst creating\nhigh-resolution, spatially coherent precipitation maps.

While automatic\nabuse detection has been widely explored in textual domain, audio abuse\ndetection still remains unexplored. In this paper, we attempt abuse detection\nin conversational audio from a multimodal perspective in a multilingual social\nmedia setting. Our key hypothesis is that along with the modelling of audio,\nincorporating discriminative information from other modalities can be highly\nbeneficial for this task. Our proposed method, MADA, explicitly focuses on two\nmodalities other than the audio itself, namely, the underlying emotions\nexpressed in the abusive audio and the semantic information encapsulated in the\ncorresponding textual form. Observations prove that MADA demonstrates gains\nover audio-only approaches on the ADIMA dataset. We test the proposed approach\non 10 different languages and observe consistent gains in the range 0.6%-5.2%\nby leveraging multiple modalities. We also perform extensive ablation\nexperiments for studying the contributions of every modality and observe the\nbest results while leveraging all the modalities together. Additionally, we\nperform experiments to empirically confirm that there is a strong correlation\nbetween underlying emotions and abusive behaviour.",

    "abstract": "We explore the cryptographic power of arbitrary shared physical resources.\nThe most general such resource is access to a fresh entangled quantum state at\nthe outset of each protocol execution. We call this the Common Reference\nQuantum State (CRQS) model, in analogy to the well-known Common Reference\nString (CRS). The CRQS model is a natural generalization of the CRS model but\nappears to be more powerful: in the two-party setting, a CRQS can sometimes\nexhibit properties associated with a Random Oracle queried once by measuring a\nmaximally entangled state in one of many mutually unbiased bases. We formalize\nthis notion as a Weak One-Time Random Oracle (WOTRO), where we only ask of the\nm-bit output to have some randomness when conditioned on the n-bit input.\nWe show that WOTRO with $n - m \\in {\\omega}(\\lg n)$ is black-box impossible\nin the CRQS model, meaning that no protocol can have its security black-box\nreduced to a cryptographic game. We define a (inefficient) quantum adversary\nagainst any WOTRO protocol that can be efficiently simulated in polynomial\ntime, ruling out any reduction to a secure game that only makes black-box\nqueries to the adversary. On the other hand, we introduce a non-game quantum\nassumption for hash functions that implies WOTRO in the CRQ\\$ model (where the\nCRQS consists only of EPR pairs). We first build a statistically secure WOTRO\nprotocol where $m = n$, then hash the output.\nThe impossibility of WOTRO has the following consequences. First, we show the\nblack-box impossibility of a quantum Fiat-Shamir transform, extending the\nimpossibility result of Bitansky et al. (TCC '13) to the CRQS model. Second, we\nshow a black-box impossibility result for a strenghtened version of quantum\nlightning (Zhandry, Eurocrypt '19) where quantum bolts have an additional\nparameter that cannot be changed without generating new bolts.",

    "abstract": "Melanoma is a fatal skin cancer that is curable and has dramatically\nincreasing survival rate when diagnosed at early stages. Learning-based methods\nhold significant promise for the detection of melanoma from dermoscopic images.\nHowever, since melanoma is a rare disease, existing databases of skin lesions\npredominantly contain highly imbalanced numbers of benign versus malignant\nsamples. In turn, this imbalance introduces substantial bias in classification\nmodels due to the statistical dominance of the majority class. To address this\nissue, we introduce a deep clustering approach based on the latent-space\nembedding of dermoscopic images. Clustering is achieved using a novel\ncenter-oriented margin-free triplet loss (COM-Triplet) enforced on image\nembeddings from a convolutional neural network backbone. The proposed method\naims to form maximally-separated cluster centers as opposed to minimizing\nclassification error, so it is less sensitive to class imbalance. To avoid the\nneed for labeled data, we further propose to implement COM-Triplet based on\npseudo-labels generated by a Gaussian mixture model. Comprehensive experiments\nshow that deep clustering with COM-Triplet loss outperforms clustering with\ntriplet loss, and competing classifiers in both supervised and unsupervised\nsettings.",

    "abstract": "Speaker verification (SV) provides billions of voice-enabled devices with\naccess control, and ensures the security of voice-driven technologies. As a\ntype of biometrics, it is necessary that SV is unbiased, with consistent and\nreliable performance across speakers irrespective of their demographic, social\nand economic attributes. Current SV evaluation practices are insufficient for\nevaluating bias: they are over-simplified and aggregate users, not\nrepresentative of real-life usage scenarios, and consequences of errors are not\naccounted for. This paper proposes design guidelines for constructing SV\nevaluation datasets that address these short-comings. We propose a schema for\ngrading the difficulty of utterance pairs, and present an algorithm for\ngenerating inclusive SV datasets. We empirically validate our proposed method\nin a set of experiments on the VoxCeleb1 dataset.

In particular, a variety of\ndeep learning approaches has been proposed, with forecast distributions\nobtained as output of neural networks. These neural network-based methods are\noften used in the form of an ensemble based on multiple model runs from\ndifferent random initializations, resulting in a collection of forecast\ndistributions that need to be aggregated into a final probabilistic prediction.\nWith the aim of consolidating findings from the machine learning literature on\nensemble methods and the statistical literature on forecast combination, we\naddress the question of how to aggregate distribution forecasts based on such\ndeep ensembles. Using theoretical arguments, simulation experiments and a case\nstudy on wind gust forecasting, we systematically compare probability- and\nquantile-based aggregation methods for three neural network-based approaches\nwith different forecast distribution types as output. Our results show that\ncombining forecast distributions can substantially improve the predictive\nperformance.

Furthermore, we prove\nthat the breakdown point of the SDR estimator is equal to $1/2$, the highest\npossible value of the breakdown point. In addition, the SDR estimator is\nequivariant by similarity transforms and has low computational complexity. More\nprecisely, in the case of $n$ vectors of dimension $p$ -- at most $\\varepsilon\nn$ out of which are adversarially corrupted -- the SDR estimator has a squared\nerror of order $\\big(\\frac{r_\\Sigma}{n} +\n\\varepsilon^2\\log(1/\\varepsilon)\\big){\\log p}$ and a running time of order $p^3\n+ n p^2$.

    "abstract": "We introduce a Markovian framework for load balancing where classical\nalgorithms such as Power-of-$d$ are combined with asynchronous auto-scaling\nfeatures. These allow the net service capacity to scale up or down in response\nto the current load within the same timescale of job dynamics. This is inspired\nby serverless frameworks such as Knative, used among others by Google Cloud\nRun, where servers are software functions that can be flexibly instantiated in\nmilliseconds according to user-defined scaling rules. In this context, load\nbalancing and auto-scaling are employed together to optimize both\nuser-perceived delay performance and energy consumption. In the literature,\nthese mechanisms are synchronous or rely on a central queue. The architectural\nnovelty of our work is to consider an asynchronous and decentralized system, as\nin Knative, which takes scalability to the next level.\nUnder a general assumption on the auto-scaling process, we prove a mean-field\nlimit theorem that provides an accurate approximation for the system dynamics\nwhen the mean demand and nominal service capacity grow large in proportion. We\ncharacterize the fixed points of the mean-field limit model and provide a\nsimple condition telling whether or not all the available servers need to be\nturned on to handle the incoming demand. Then, we investigate how to design\noptimal auto-scaling rules and find a general condition able to drive the\nmean-field dynamics to delay and relative energy optimality, a situation where\nthe user-perceived delay and the relative energy wastage induced by idle\nservers vanish. The proposed optimality condition suggests to scale up capacity\nif and only if the mean demand exceeds the overall rate at which servers become\nidle and active. This yields the definition of tractable optimization\nframeworks to trade off between energy and performance, which we show as an\napplication of our work.",

    "abstract": "The modeling of human emotion expression in speech signals is an important,\nyet challenging task. The high resource demand of speech emotion recognition\nmodels, combined with the the general scarcity of emotion-labelled data are\nobstacles to the development and application of effective solutions in this\nfield. In this paper, we present an approach to jointly circumvent these\ndifficulties. Our method, named RH-emo, is a novel semi-supervised architecture\naimed at extracting quaternion embeddings from real-valued monoaural\nspectrograms, enabling the use of quaternion-valued networks for speech emotion\nrecognition tasks. RH-emo is a hybrid real/quaternion autoencoder network that\nconsists of a real-valued encoder in parallel to a real-valued emotion\nclassifier and a quaternion-valued decoder. On the one hand, the classifier\npermits to optimize each latent axis of the embeddings for the classification\nof a specific emotion-related characteristic: valence, arousal, dominance and\noverall emotion. On the other hand, the quaternion reconstruction enables the\nlatent dimension to develop intra-channel correlations that are required for an\neffective representation as a quaternion entity. We test our approach on speech\nemotion recognition tasks using four popular datasets: Iemocap, Ravdess, EmoDb\nand Tess, comparing the performance of three well-established real-valued CNN\narchitectures (AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG) and their quaternion-valued equivalent\nfed with the embeddings created with RH-emo. We obtain a consistent improvement\nin the test accuracy for all datasets, while drastically reducing the\nresources' demand of models. Moreover, we performed additional experiments and\nablation studies that confirm the effectiveness of our approach. The RH-emo\nrepository is available at: https://github.com/ispamm/rhemo.",
