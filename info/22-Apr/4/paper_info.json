    "abstract": "Ball 3D localization in team sports has various applications including\nautomatic offside detection in soccer, or shot release localization in\nbasketball. Today, this task is either resolved by using expensive multi-views\nsetups, or by restricting the analysis to ballistic trajectories. In this work,\nwe propose to address the task on a single image from a calibrated monocular\ncamera by estimating ball diameter in pixels and use the knowledge of real ball\ndiameter in meters. This approach is suitable for any game situation where the\nball is (even partly) visible. To achieve this, we use a small neural network\ntrained on image patches around candidates generated by a conventional ball\ndetector. Besides predicting ball diameter, our network outputs the confidence\nof having a ball in the image patch. Validations on 3 basketball datasets\nreveals that our model gives remarkable predictions on ball 3D localization. In\naddition, through its confidence output, our model improves the detection rate\nby filtering the candidates produced by the detector. The contributions of this\nwork are (i) the first model to address 3D ball localization on a single image,\n(ii) an effective method for ball 3D annotation from single calibrated images,\n(iii) a high quality 3D ball evaluation dataset annotated from a single\nviewpoint.

    "abstract": "Reproducibility is of utmost concern in machine learning and natural language\nprocessing (NLP). In the field of natural language generation (especially\nmachine translation), the seminal paper of Post (2018) has pointed out problems\nof reproducibility of the dominant metric, BLEU, at the time of publication.\nNowadays, BERT-based evaluation metrics considerably outperform BLEU. In this\npaper, we ask whether results and claims from four recent BERT-based metrics\ncan be reproduced. We find that reproduction of claims and results often fails\nbecause of (i) heavy undocumented preprocessing involved in the metrics, (ii)\nmissing code and (iii) reporting weaker results for the baseline metrics. (iv)\nIn one case, the problem stems from correlating not to human scores but to a\nwrong column in the csv file, inflating scores by 5 points. Motivated by the\nimpact of preprocessing, we then conduct a second study where we examine its\neffects more closely (for one of the metrics). We find that preprocessing can\nhave large effects, especially for highly inflectional languages. In this case,\nthe effect of preprocessing may be larger than the effect of the aggregation\nmechanism (e.g., greedy alignment vs. Word Mover Distance).",

    "abstract": "We present a novel method for classification of Synthetic Aperture Radar\n(SAR) data by combining ideas from graph-based learning and neural network\nmethods within an active learning framework. Graph-based methods in machine\nlearning are based on a similarity graph constructed from the data. When the\ndata consists of raw images composed of scenes, extraneous information can make\nthe classification task more difficult. In recent years, neural network methods\nhave been shown to provide a promising framework for extracting patterns from\nSAR images. These methods, however, require ample training data to avoid\noverfitting. At the same time, such training data are often unavailable for\napplications of interest, such as automatic target recognition (ATR) and SAR\ndata. We use a Convolutional Neural Network Variational Autoencoder (CNNVAE) to\nembed SAR data into a feature space, and then construct a similarity graph from\nthe embedded data and apply graph-based semi-supervised learning techniques.\nThe CNNVAE feature embedding and graph construction requires no labeled data,\nwhich reduces overfitting and improves the generalization performance of graph\nlearning at low label rates. Furthermore, the method easily incorporates a\nhuman-in-the-loop for active learning in the data-labeling process. We present\npromising results and compare them to other standard machine learning methods\non the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset\nfor ATR with small amounts of labeled data.",

However, practical\nscenarios often involve a data-generating process that produces highly\ndependent data samples, which are known to heavily bias the stochastic\noptimization process and slow down the convergence of learning. In this paper,\nwe conduct a fundamental study on how different stochastic data sampling\nschemes affect the sample complexity of online stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD) over highly dependent data. Specifically, with a $\\phi$-mixing model of\ndata dependence, we show that online SGD with proper periodic data-subsampling\nachieves an improved sample complexity over the standard online SGD in the full\nspectrum of the data dependence level. Interestingly, even subsampling a subset\nof data samples can accelerate the convergence of online SGD over highly\ndependent data. Moreover, we show that online SGD with mini-batch sampling can\nfurther substantially improve the sample complexity over online SGD with\nperiodic data-subsampling over highly dependent data.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial\nexamples. It is thus imperative to devise effective attack algorithms to\nidentify the deficiencies of DNNs beforehand in security-sensitive\napplications. To efficiently tackle the black-box setting where the target\nmodel's particulars are unknown, feature-level transfer-based attacks propose\nto contaminate the intermediate feature outputs of local models, and then\ndirectly employ the crafted adversarial samples to attack the target model. Due\nto the transferability of features, feature-level attacks have shown promise in\nsynthesizing more transferable adversarial samples. However, existing\nfeature-level attacks generally employ inaccurate neuron importance\nestimations, which deteriorates their transferability. To overcome such\npitfalls, in this paper, we propose the Neuron Attribution-based Attack (NAA),\nwhich conducts feature-level attacks with more accurate neuron importance\nestimations. Specifically, we first completely attribute a model's output to\neach neuron in a middle layer. We then derive an approximation scheme of neuron\nattribution to tremendously reduce the computation overhead. Finally, we weight\nneurons based on their attribution results and launch feature-level attacks.\nExtensive experiments confirm the superiority of our approach to the\nstate-of-the-art benchmarks.",

Users need to manage software privacy settings\nproperly to protect personally identifiable information and express personal\nethical preferences. AI technologies that empower users to interact with the\ndigital world by reflecting their personal ethical preferences can be key\nenablers of a trustworthy digital society. We focus on the privacy dimension\nand contribute a step in the above direction through an empirical study on an\nexisting dataset collected from the fitness domain. We find out which set of\nquestions is appropriate to differentiate users according to their preferences.\nThe results reveal that a compact set of semantic-driven questions (about\ndomain-independent privacy preferences) helps distinguish users better than a\ncomplex domain-dependent one. This confirms the study's hypothesis that moral\nattitudes are the relevant piece of information to collect.

Proof-of-work offers an alternative gate-keeping\nmechanism, but its probabilistic nature is incompatible with conventional\nsecurity definitions.

    "abstract": "Recent studies in neuroscience suggest that Successor Representation\n(SR)-based models provide adaptation to changes in the goal locations or reward\nfunction faster than model-free algorithms, together with lower computational\ncost compared to that of model-based algorithms. However, it is not known how\nsuch representation might help animals to manage uncertainty in their\ndecision-making. Existing methods for SR learning do not capture uncertainty\nabout the estimated SR. In order to address this issue, the paper presents a\nKalman filter-based SR framework, referred to as Adaptive Kalman\nFiltering-based Successor Representation (AKF-SR). First, Kalman temporal\ndifference approach, which is a combination of the Kalman filter and the\ntemporal difference method, is used within the AKF-SR framework to cast the SR\nlearning procedure into a filtering problem to benefit from the uncertainty\nestimation of the SR, and also decreases in memory requirement and sensitivity\nto model's parameters in comparison to deep neural network-based algorithms. An\nadaptive Kalman filtering approach is then applied within the proposed AKF-SR\nframework in order to tune the measurement noise covariance and measurement\nmapping function of Kalman filter as the most important parameters affecting\nthe filter's performance. Moreover, an active learning method that exploits the\nestimated uncertainty of the SR to form the behaviour policy leading to more\nvisits to less certain values is proposed to improve the overall performance of\nan agent in terms of received rewards while interacting with its environment.",

Previous results indicate that the steady-state\nnetwork flow equations for an ideal gas are difficult to solve by the\nNewton-Raphson method because of its extreme sensitivity to the initial guess.\nIn contrast, we find that non-dimensionalization of the steady-state problem is\nkey to robust convergence of the Newton-Raphson method. We identify criteria\nbased on the uniqueness of solutions under which the existence of a\nnon-physical generalized solution found by a non-linear solver implies\nnon-existence of a physical solution, i.e., infeasibility of the problem.\nFinally, we compare pressure and flow solutions based on ideal and non-ideal\nequations of state to demonstrate the need to apply the latter in practice. The\nsolver developed in this article is open-source and is made available for both\nthe academic and research communities as well as the industry.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of on-line evaluation of critical characteristic\nparameters such as the L_2-gain (L2G), input feedforward passivity index (IFP)\nand output feedback passivity index (OFP) of non-linear systems using their\ninput-output data. Typically, having an accurate measure of such \"system\nindices\" enables the application of systematic control design techniques.\nMoreover, if such system indices can efficiently be evaluated on-line, they can\nbe exploited to device intelligent controller reconfiguration and\nfault-tolerant control techniques. However, the existing estimation methods of\nsuch system indices (i.e., L2G, IFP and OFP) are predominantly off-line,\ncomputationally inefficient, and require a large amount of actual or\nsynthetically generated input-output trajectory data under some specific\ninitial/terminal conditions. On the other hand, the existing on-line estimation\nmethods take an averaging-based approach, which may be sub-optimal,\ncomputationally inefficient and susceptible to estimate saturation. In this\npaper, to overcome these challenges (in the on-line estimation of system\nindices), we establish and exploit several interesting theoretical results on a\nparticular class of fractional function optimization problems. For comparison\npurposes, the details of an existing averaging-based approach are provided for\nthe same on-line estimation problem. Finally, several numerical examples are\ndiscussed to demonstrate the proposed on-line estimation approach and to\nhighlight our contributions.",

To mitigate their negative effect, it is advantageous to accurately\nidentify them early in the season to prevent their spread throughout the field.\nTraditionally, farmers rely on manually scouting fields and applying herbicides\nfor different weeds. However, it is easy to confuse between crops with weeds\nduring the early growth stages. Recently, deep learning-based weed\nidentification has become popular as deep learning relies on convolutional\nneural networks that are capable of learning important distinguishable features\nbetween weeds and crops. However, training robust deep learning models requires\naccess to large imagery datasets. Therefore, an early-season weeds dataset was\nacquired under field conditions. The dataset consists of 159 Cocklebur images,\n139 Foxtail images, 170 Redroot Pigweed images and 150 Giant Ragweed images\ncorresponding to four common weed species found in corn and soybean production\nsystems.. Bounding box annotations were created for each image to prepare the\ndataset for training both image classification and object detection deep\nlearning networks capable of accurately locating and identifying weeds within\ncorn and soybean fields.

    "abstract": "Embedded in any speech signal is a rich combination of cognitive,\nneuromuscular and physiological information. This richness makes speech a\npowerful signal in relation to a range of different health conditions,\nincluding major depressive disorders (MDD). One pivotal issue in\nspeech-depression research is the assumption that depressive severity is the\ndominant measurable effect. However, given the heterogeneous clinical profile\nof MDD, it may actually be the case that speech alterations are more strongly\nassociated with subsets of key depression symptoms. This paper presents strong\nevidence in support of this argument. First, we present a novel large,\ncross-sectional, multi-modal dataset collected at Thymia. We then present a set\nof machine learning experiments that demonstrate that combining speech with\nfeatures from an n-Back working memory assessment improves classifier\nperformance when predicting the popular eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire\ndepression scale (PHQ-8). Finally, we present a set of experiments that\nhighlight the association between different speech and n-Back markers at the\nPHQ-8 item level. Specifically, we observe that somatic and psychomotor\nsymptoms are more strongly associated with n-Back performance scores, whilst\nthe other items: anhedonia, depressed mood, change in appetite, feelings of\nworthlessness and trouble concentrating are more strongly associated with\nspeech changes.",

    "abstract": "Existing works have identified the limitation of top-$1$ attack success rate\n(ASR) as a metric to evaluate the attack strength but exclusively investigated\nit in the white-box setting, while our work extends it to a more practical\nblack-box setting: transferable attack. It is widely reported that stronger\nI-FGSM transfers worse than simple FGSM, leading to a popular belief that\ntransferability is at odds with the white-box attack strength. Our work\nchallenges this belief with empirical finding that stronger attack actually\ntransfers better for the general top-$k$ ASR indicated by the interest class\nrank (ICR) after attack. For increasing the attack strength, with an intuitive\ninterpretation of the logit gradient from the geometric perspective, we\nidentify that the weakness of the commonly used losses lie in prioritizing the\nspeed to fool the network instead of maximizing its strength. To this end, we\npropose a new normalized CE loss that guides the logit to be updated in the\ndirection of implicitly maximizing its rank distance from the ground-truth\nclass. Extensive results in various settings have verified that our proposed\nnew loss is simple yet effective for top-$k$ attack. Code is available at:\n\\url{https://bit.ly/3uCiomP}",

We further leverage the flexibility of transformer input\nand propose an attention-guided non-uniform cropping method, so that\nuninformative image patches are removed with negligible drop on performance to\nreduce computation cost. The saved computation can be reallocated to increase\nresolution only for informative patches, resulting in performance improvement\nwith no additional computation cost. This \"attend and zoom-in\" strategy is\nhighly similar to human behavior when observing images. Remarkably, TransGeo\nachieves state-of-the-art results on both urban and rural datasets, with\nsignificantly less computation cost than CNN-based methods.

In this work, we\npropose dynamic multimodal fusion (DynMM), a new approach that adaptively fuses\nmultimodal data and generates data-dependent forward paths during inference.\nDynMM can reduce redundant computations for \"easy\" multimodal inputs (that can\nbe predicted correctly using only one modality or simple fusion techniques) and\nretain representation power for \"hard\" samples by adopting all modalities and\ncomplex fusion operations for prediction. Results on various multimodal tasks\ndemonstrate the efficiency and wide applicability of our approach. For\ninstance, DynMM can reduce the computation cost by 46.5% with a negligible\naccuracy loss on CMU-MOSEI sentiment analysis. For RGB-D semantic segmentation\non NYU Depth data, DynMM achieves a +0.7% mIoU improvement with over 21%\nreductions for the depth encoder when compared with strong baselines.

It will\nbe problematic to use a single sensory input to track the behaviour of such\nobjects: vision can be subjected to occlusions, whereas tactile inputs cannot\ncapture the global information that is useful for the task. In this paper, we\nstudy the problem of using vision and tactile inputs together to complete the\ntask of following deformable linear objects, for the first time. We create a\nReinforcement Learning agent using different sensing modalities and investigate\nhow its behaviour can be boosted using visual-tactile fusion, compared to using\na single sensing modality. To this end, we developed a benchmark in simulation\nfor manipulating the deformable linear objects using multimodal sensing inputs.\nThe policy of the agent uses distilled information, e.g., the pose of the\nobject in both visual and tactile perspectives, instead of the raw sensing\nsignals, so that it can be directly transferred to real environments. In this\nway, we disentangle the perception system and the learned control policy. Our\nextensive experiments show that the use of both vision and tactile inputs,\ntogether with proprioception, allows the agent to complete the task in up to\n92% of cases, compared to 77% when only one of the signals is given.

    "title": "Designing for emotion regulation interventions: an agenda for HCI theory  and research",
    "abstract": "There is a growing interest in HCI to envision, design, and evaluate\ntechnology-enabled interventions that support users' emotion regulation. This\ninterest stems in part from increased recognition that the ability to regulate\nemotions is critical to mental health, and that a lack of effective emotion\nregulation is a transdiagnostic factor for mental illness. However, the\npotential to combine innovative HCI designs with the theoretical grounding and\nstate-of-art interventions from psychology has yet to be fully realised. In\nthis paper, we synthesise HCI work on emotion regulation interventions and\npropose a three-part framework to guide technology designers in making: (i)\ntheory-informed decisions about intervention targets; (ii) strategic decisions\nregarding the technology-enabled intervention mechanisms to be included in the\nsystem; and (iii) practical decisions around previous implementations of the\nselected intervention components. We show how this framework can both\nsystematise HCI work to date and suggest a research agenda for future work.",

    "abstract": "In many machine learning tasks, input features with varying degrees of\npredictive capability are acquired at varying costs. In order to optimize the\nperformance-cost trade-off, one would select features to observe a priori.\nHowever, given the changing context with previous observations, the subset of\npredictive features to select may change dynamically. Therefore, we face the\nchallenging new problem of foresight dynamic selection (FDS): finding a dynamic\nand light-weight policy to decide which features to observe next, before\nactually observing them, for overall performance-cost trade-offs. To tackle\nFDS, this paper proposes a Bayesian learning framework of Variational Foresight\nDynamic Selection (VFDS). VFDS learns a policy that selects the next feature\nsubset to observe, by optimizing a variational Bayesian objective that\ncharacterizes the trade-off between model performance and feature cost. At its\ncore is an implicit variational distribution on binary gates that are dependent\non previous observations, which will select the next subset of features to\nobserve. We apply VFDS on the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) task where the\nperformance-cost trade-off is critical in its practice. Extensive results\ndemonstrate that VFDS selects different features under changing contexts,\nnotably saving sensory costs while maintaining or improving the HAR accuracy.\nMoreover, the features that VFDS dynamically select are shown to be\ninterpretable and associated with the different activity types.

    "abstract": "Human-robot handover is a fundamental yet challenging task in human-robot\ninteraction and collaboration. Recently, remarkable progressions have been made\nin human-to-robot handovers of unknown objects by using learning-based grasp\ngenerators. However, how to responsively generate smooth motions to take an\nobject from a human is still an open question. Specifically, planning motions\nthat take human comfort into account is not a part of the human-robot handover\nprocess in most prior works. In this paper, we propose to generate smooth\nmotions via an efficient model-predictive control (MPC) framework that\nintegrates perception and complex domain-specific constraints into the\noptimization problem. We introduce a learning-based grasp reachability model to\nselect candidate grasps which maximize the robot's manipulability, giving it\nmore freedom to satisfy these constraints. Finally, we integrate a neural net\nforce/torque classifier that detects contact events from noisy data. We\nconducted human-to-robot handover experiments on a diverse set of objects with\nseveral users (N=4) and performed a systematic evaluation of each module. The\nstudy shows that the users preferred our MPC approach over the baseline system\nby a large margin.

In the second application, ML is used\nas a replacement of a model predictive controller where the ML controller\nlearns the optimal control action by imitating or mimicking the behavior of the\nmodel predictive controller. In this study, a deep recurrent neural network\nincluding long-short term memory (LSTM) layers are used to model the emission\nand performance of a 4.5 liter 4-cylinder Cummins compression ignition engine.\nThis model is then used for model predictive controller implementation. Then, a\ndeep learning scheme is deployed to clone the behavior of the developed\ncontroller. In the LSTM integration, a novel scheme is used by augmenting\nhidden and cell states of the network in an NMPC optimization problem. The\ndeveloped LSTM-NMPC and the imitative NMPC are compared with the calibrated\nCummins Engine Control Unit (ECU) model in an experimentally validated engine\nsimulation platform.

    "abstract": "Attacks on computer networks have increased significantly in recent days, due\nin part to the availability of sophisticated tools for launching such attacks\nas well as thriving underground cyber-crime economy to support it. Over the\npast several years, researchers in academia and industry used machine learning\n(ML) techniques to design and implement Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) for\ncomputer networks. Many of these researchers used datasets collected by various\norganizations to train ML models for predicting intrusions. In many of the\ndatasets used in such systems, data are imbalanced (i.e., not all classes have\nequal amount of samples). With unbalanced data, the predictive models developed\nusing ML algorithms may produce unsatisfactory classifiers which would affect\naccuracy in predicting intrusions. Traditionally, researchers used\nover-sampling and under-sampling for balancing data in datasets to overcome\nthis problem. In this work, in addition to over-sampling, we also use a\nsynthetic data generation method, called Conditional Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (CTGAN), to balance data and study their effect on various ML\nclassifiers. To the best of our knowledge, no one else has used CTGAN to\ngenerate synthetic samples to balance intrusion detection datasets. Based on\nextensive experiments using a widely used dataset NSL-KDD, we found that\ntraining ML models on dataset balanced with synthetic samples generated by\nCTGAN increased prediction accuracy by up to $8\\%$, compared to training the\nsame ML models over unbalanced data. Our experiments also show that the\naccuracy of some ML models trained over data balanced with random over-sampling\ndecline compared to the same ML models trained over unbalanced data.",

    "abstract": "Semi- and weakly-supervised learning have recently attracted considerable\nattention in the object detection literature since they can alleviate the cost\nof annotation needed to successfully train deep learning models. State-of-art\napproaches for semi-supervised learning rely on student-teacher models trained\nusing a multi-stage process, and considerable data augmentation. Custom\nnetworks have been developed for the weakly-supervised setting, making it\ndifficult to adapt to different detectors. In this paper, a weakly\nsemi-supervised training method is introduced that reduces these training\nchallenges, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance by leveraging only a\nsmall fraction of fully-labeled images with information in weakly-labeled\nimages. In particular, our generic sampling-based learning strategy produces\npseudo-ground-truth (GT) bounding box annotations in an online fashion,\neliminating the need for multi-stage training, and student-teacher network\nconfigurations. These pseudo GT boxes are sampled from weakly-labeled images\nbased on the categorical score of object proposals accumulated via a score\npropagation process. Empirical results on the Pascal VOC dataset, indicate that\nthe proposed approach improves performance by 5.0% when using VOC 2007 as\nfully-labeled, and VOC 2012 as weak-labeled data. Also, with 5-10% fully\nannotated images, we observed an improvement of more than 10% in mAP, showing\nthat a modest investment in image-level annotation, can substantially improve\ndetection performance.",

Connecting these two levels of control design in a way that\nensures constraint satisfaction is achieved through the use of\n\\textit{B\\'{e}zier curves}, which enable planning continuous trajectories\nrespecting constraints by planning a sequence of discrete points. Our framework\nis encoded via convex optimization problems which may be efficiently solved, as\ndemonstrated in simulation.",

    "title": "An End-to-end Supervised Domain Adaptation Framework for Cross-Domain  Change Detection",
    "abstract": "Existing deep learning-based change detection methods try to elaborately\ndesign complicated neural networks with powerful feature representations, but\nignore the universal domain shift induced by time-varying land cover changes,\nincluding luminance fluctuations and season changes between pre-event and\npost-event images, thereby producing sub-optimal results. In this paper, we\npropose an end-to-end Supervised Domain Adaptation framework for cross-domain\nChange Detection, namely SDACD, to effectively alleviate the domain shift\nbetween bi-temporal images for better change predictions. Specifically, our\nSDACD presents collaborative adaptations from both image and feature\nperspectives with supervised learning. Image adaptation exploits generative\nadversarial learning with cycle-consistency constraints to perform cross-domain\nstyle transformation, effectively narrowing the domain gap in a two-side\ngeneration fashion. As to feature adaptation, we extract domain-invariant\nfeatures to align different feature distributions in the feature space, which\ncould further reduce the domain gap of cross-domain images. To further improve\nthe performance, we combine three types of bi-temporal images for the final\nchange prediction, including the initial input bi-temporal images and two\ngenerated bi-temporal images from the pre-event and post-event domains.\nExtensive experiments and analyses on two benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness and universality of our proposed framework. Notably, our\nframework pushes several representative baseline models up to new\nState-Of-The-Art records, achieving 97.34% and 92.36% on the CDD and WHU\nbuilding datasets, respectively.

    "abstract": "Although issues of open source software are created to discuss and solve\ntechnical problems, conversations can become heated, with discussants getting\nangry and/or agitated for a variety of reasons, such as poor suggestions or\nviolation of community conventions. To prevent and mitigate discussions from\ngetting heated, tools like GitHub have introduced the ability to lock issue\ndiscussions that violate the code of conduct or other community guidelines.\nDespite some early research on locked issues, there is a lack of understanding\nof how communities use this feature and of potential threats to validity for\nresearchers relying on a dataset of locked issues as an oracle for heated\ndiscussions. To address this gap, we (i) quantitatively analyzed 79 GitHub\nprojects that have at least one issue locked as too heated, and (ii)\nqualitatively analyzed all issues locked as too heated of the 79 projects, a\ntotal of 205 issues comprising 5,511 comments. We found that projects have\ndifferent behaviors when locking issues: while 54 locked less than 10% of their\nclosed issues, 14 projects locked more than 90% of their closed issues.\nAdditionally, locked issues tend to have a similar number of comments,\nparticipants, and emoji reactions to non-locked issues. For the 205 issues\nlocked as too heated, we found that one-third do not contain any uncivil\ndiscourse, and only 8.82% of the analyzed comments are actually uncivil.\nFinally, we found that the locking justifications provided by maintainers do\nnot always match the label used to lock the issue. Based on our results, we\nidentified three pitfalls to avoid when using the GitHub locked issues data and\nwe provide recommendations for researchers and practitioners.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of view synthesis with certain amount of\nrotations from a pair of images, what we called stereo unstructured\nmagnification. While the multi-plane image representation is well suited for\nview synthesis with depth invariant, how to generalize it to unstructured views\nremains a significant challenge. This is primarily due to the depth-dependency\ncaused by camera frontal parallel representation. Here we propose a novel\nmultiple homography image (MHI) representation, comprising of a set of scene\nplanes with fixed normals and distances. A two-stage network is developed for\nnovel view synthesis. Stage-1 is an MHI reconstruction module that predicts the\nMHIs and composites layered multi-normal images along the normal direction.\nStage-2 is a normal-blending module to find blending weights. We also derive an\nangle-based cost to guide the blending of multi-normal images by exploiting\nper-normal geometry.

    "abstract": "Provenance embedding algorithms are well known for tracking the footprints of\ninformation flow in wireless networks. Recently, low-latency provenance\nembedding algorithms have received traction in vehicular networks owing to\nstrict deadlines on the delivery of packets. While existing low-latency\nprovenance embedding methods focus on reducing the packet delay, they assume a\ncomplete graph on the underlying topology due to the mobility of the\nparticipating nodes. We identify that the complete graph assumption leads to\nsub-optimal performance in provenance recovery, especially when the vehicular\nnetwork is sparse, which is usually observed outside peak-hour traffic\nconditions. As a result, we propose a two-part approach to design provenance\nembedding algorithms for sparse vehicular networks. In the first part, we\npropose secure and practical topology-learning strategies, whereas in the\nsecond part, we design provenance embedding algorithms that guarantee\nultra-reliability by incorporating the topology knowledge at the destination\nduring the provenance recovery process. Besides the novel idea of using\ntopology knowledge for provenance recovery, a distinguishing feature for\nachieving ultra-reliability is the use of hash-chains in the packet, which\ntrade communication-overhead of the packet with the complexity-overhead at the\ndestination. We derive tight upper bounds on the performance of our strategies,\nand show that the derived bounds, when optimized with appropriate constraints,\ndeliver design parameters that outperform existing methods. Finally, we also\nimplement our ideas on OMNeT++ based simulation environment to show that their\nlatency benefits indeed make them suitable for vehicular network applications.",

For low-resource scenarios,\nprompt-based learning for PLMs exploits prompts as task guidance and turns\ndownstream tasks into masked language problems for effective few-shot\nfine-tuning. In most existing approaches, the high performance of prompt-based\nlearning heavily relies on handcrafted prompts and verbalizers, which may limit\nthe application of such approaches in real-world scenarios. To solve this\nissue, we present CP-Tuning, the first end-to-end Contrastive Prompt Tuning\nframework for fine-tuning PLMs without any manual engineering of task-specific\nprompts and verbalizers.

We further\npropose the pair-wise cost-sensitive contrastive learning procedure to optimize\nthe model in order to achieve verbalizer-free class mapping and enhance the\ntask-invariance of prompts. It explicitly learns to distinguish different\nclasses and makes the decision boundary smoother by assigning different costs\nto easy and hard cases.

The proper placement of VNFs in the hosting infrastructures is one of\nthe main technical challenges.

To recover more task-specific information, the grafted\nfeature is further input into a shallow network to be transformed before\ncalculating the cost. Extensive experiments show that the model generalization\nability can be improved significantly with this broad-spectrum and\ntask-oriented feature. Specifically, based on two well-known architectures\nPSMNet and GANet, our methods are superior to other robust algorithms when\ntransferring from SceneFlow to KITTI 2015, KITTI 2012, and Middlebury.

    "abstract": "The application of cross-dataset training in object detection tasks is\ncomplicated because the inconsistency in the category range across datasets\ntransforms fully supervised learning into semi-supervised learning. To address\nthis problem, recent studies focus on the generation of high-quality missing\nannotations. In this study, we first point out that it is not enough to\ngenerate high-quality annotations using a single model, which only looks once\nfor annotations. Through detailed experimental analyses, we further conclude\nthat hard-label training is conducive to generating high-recall annotations,\nwhile soft-label training tends to obtain high-precision annotations. Inspired\nby the aspects mentioned above, we propose a dynamic supervisor framework that\nupdates the annotations multiple times through multiple-updated submodels\ntrained using hard and soft labels. In the final generated annotations, both\nrecall and precision improve significantly through the integration of\nhard-label training with soft-label training. Extensive experiments conducted\non various dataset combination settings support our analyses and demonstrate\nthe superior performance of the proposed dynamic supervisor.",

    "abstract": "We study a class of filters -- discrete finite-state transition systems\nemployed as incremental stream transducers -- that have application to\nrobotics: e.g., to model combinatorial estimators and also as concise encodings\nof feedback plans/policies. The present paper examines their minimization\nproblem under some new assumptions. Compared to strictly deterministic filters,\nallowing nondeterminism supplies opportunities for compression via re-use of\nstates. But this paper suggests that the classic automata-theoretic concept of\nnondeterminism, though it affords said opportunities for reduction in state\ncomplexity, is problematic in many robotics settings. Instead, we argue for a\nnew constrained type of nondeterminism that preserves input-output behavior for\ncircumstances when, as for robots, causation forbids 'rewinding' of the world.\nWe identify problem instances where compression under this constrained form of\nnondeterminism results in improvements over all deterministic filters. In this\nnew setting, we examine computational complexity questions for the problem of\nreducing the state complexity of some given input filter. A hardness result for\ngeneral deterministic input filters is presented, as well as for checking\nspecific, narrower requirements, and some special cases. These results show\nthat this class of nondeterminism gives problems of the same complexity class\nas classical nondeterminism, and the narrower questions help give a more\nnuanced understanding of the source of this complexity.",

    "abstract": "Vector quantization (VQ) based ANN indexes, such as Inverted File System\n(IVF) and Product Quantization (PQ), have been widely applied to embedding\nbased document retrieval thanks to the competitive time and memory efficiency.\nOriginally, VQ is learned to minimize the reconstruction loss, i.e., the\ndistortions between the original dense embeddings and the reconstructed\nembeddings after quantization. Unfortunately, such an objective is inconsistent\nwith the goal of selecting ground-truth documents for the input query, which\nmay cause severe loss of retrieval quality. Recent works identify such a\ndefect, and propose to minimize the retrieval loss through contrastive\nlearning. However, these methods intensively rely on queries with ground-truth\ndocuments, whose performance is limited by the insufficiency of labeled data.\nIn this paper, we propose Distill-VQ, which unifies the learning of IVF and\nPQ within a knowledge distillation framework. In Distill-VQ, the dense\nembeddings are leveraged as \"teachers\", which predict the query's relevance to\nthe sampled documents. The VQ modules are treated as the \"students\", which are\nlearned to reproduce the predicted relevance, such that the reconstructed\nembeddings may fully preserve the retrieval result of the dense embeddings. By\ndoing so, Distill-VQ is able to derive substantial training signals from the\nmassive unlabeled data, which significantly contributes to the retrieval\nquality. We perform comprehensive explorations for the optimal conduct of\nknowledge distillation, which may provide useful insights for the learning of\nVQ based ANN index. We also experimentally show that the labeled data is no\nlonger a necessity for high-quality vector quantization, which indicates\nDistill-VQ's strong applicability in practice.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary algorithms (EA) based neural architecture search (NAS) involves\nevaluating each architecture by training it from scratch, which is extremely\ntime-consuming. This can be reduced by using a supernet for estimating the\nfitness of an architecture due to weight sharing among all architectures in the\nsearch space. However, the estimated fitness is very noisy due to the\nco-adaptation of the operations in the supernet which results in NAS methods\ngetting trapped in local optimum. In this paper, we propose a method called\nNEvoNAS wherein the NAS problem is posed as a multi-objective problem with 2\nobjectives: (i) maximize architecture novelty, (ii) maximize architecture\nfitness/accuracy. The novelty search is used for maintaining a diverse set of\nsolutions at each generation which helps avoiding local optimum traps while the\narchitecture fitness is calculated using supernet. NSGA-II is used for finding\nthe \\textit{pareto optimal front} for the NAS problem and the best architecture\nin the pareto front is returned as the searched architecture.

Therefore, to automatically measure the\ncognitive load, existing studies have used biometric measures such as brain\nwaves and the heart rate. However, developers are often required to equip\ncertain devices when measuring them, and can therefore be physically burdened.\nIn this study, we evaluated the feasibility of non-invasive biometric measures\nbased on the nasal skin temperature. The nasal skin temperature has been widely\nused in other fields to measure mental status. In the present experiment, the\nsubjects created small Java programs, and we estimated their cognitive load\nusing the proposed biometric measures based on the nasal skin temperature. As a\nresult, the proposed biometric measures were shown to be more effective than\nnon-biometric measures.

To optimize the reorganization of urban public\ninfrastructure, it is important to provide detailed and accurate forecasts of\nthe distribution of urban populations and households. However, many local\ngovernments do not have the necessary data and forecasting capability.\nMoreover, current forecasts of gender- and age-based population data only exist\nat the municipal level, and household data are only available by family type at\nthe prefecture level. Meanwhile, the accuracy is limited with an assumption of\nsame change rate of population in all municipalities and within each city.\nTherefore, the aim of this study was to develop an agent-based microsimulation\nhousehold transition model, with the household as the unit and agent, and\nhousehold data was estimated for all cities in Japan from 2015. Estimated\nhousehold data comprised the family type, house type, and address, age, and\ngender of household members, obtained from the national census, and building\ndata.

Summarizing findings is\ntime-consuming and can be prone to error for inexperienced radiologists, and\nthus automatic impression generation has attracted substantial attention. With\nthe encoder-decoder framework, most previous studies explore incorporating\nextra knowledge (e.g., static pre-defined clinical ontologies or extra\nbackground information). Yet, they encode such knowledge by a separate encoder\nto treat it as an extra input to their models, which is limited in leveraging\ntheir relations with the original findings. To address the limitation, we\npropose a unified framework for exploiting both extra knowledge and the\noriginal findings in an integrated way so that the critical information (i.e.,\nkey words and their relations) can be extracted in an appropriate way to\nfacilitate impression generation. In detail, for each input findings, it is\nencoded by a text encoder, and a graph is constructed through its entities and\ndependency tree. Then, a graph encoder (e.g., graph neural networks (GNNs)) is\nadopted to model relation information in the constructed graph. Finally, to\nemphasize the key words in the findings, contrastive learning is introduced to\nmap positive samples (constructed by masking non-key words) closer and push\napart negative ones (constructed by masking key words).

    "abstract": "The key of sequential recommendation lies in the accurate item correlation\nmodeling. Previous models infer such information based on item co-occurrences,\nwhich may fail to capture the real causal relations, and impact the\nrecommendation performance and explainability. In this paper, we equip\nsequential recommendation with a novel causal discovery module to capture\ncausalities among user behaviors. Our general idea is firstly assuming a causal\ngraph underlying item correlations, and then we learn the causal graph jointly\nwith the sequential recommender model by fitting the real user behavior data.\nMore specifically, in order to satisfy the causality requirement, the causal\ngraph is regularized by a differentiable directed acyclic constraint.\nConsidering that the number of items in recommender systems can be very large,\nwe represent different items with a unified set of latent clusters, and the\ncausal graph is defined on the cluster level, which enhances the model\nscalability and robustness. In addition, we provide theoretical analysis on the\nidentifiability of the learned causal graph. To the best of our knowledge, this\npaper makes a first step towards combining sequential recommendation with\ncausal discovery. For evaluating the recommendation performance, we implement\nour framework with different neural sequential architectures, and compare them\nwith many state-of-the-art methods based on real-world datasets. Empirical\nstudies manifest that our model can on average improve the performance by about\n7% and 11% on f1 and NDCG, respectively.

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised object localization aims to find a target object region in\na given image with only weak supervision, such as image-level labels. Most\nexisting methods use a class activation map (CAM) to generate a localization\nmap; however, a CAM identifies only the most discriminative parts of a target\nobject rather than the entire object region. In this work, we find the gap\nbetween classification and localization in terms of the misalignment of the\ndirections between an input feature and a class-specific weight. We demonstrate\nthat the misalignment suppresses the activation of CAM in areas that are less\ndiscriminative but belong to the target object. To bridge the gap, we propose a\nmethod to align feature directions with a class-specific weight. The proposed\nmethod achieves a state-of-the-art localization performance on the CUB-200-2011\nand ImageNet-1K benchmarks.",

Effectively mining correct answers from the open-domain\nsources still has a fair way to go.

Recently, conversational OpenQA is proposed to address\nthese issues with the abundant contextual information in the conversation.\nPromising as it might be, there exist several fundamental limitations including\nthe inaccurate question understanding, the coarse ranking for passage\nselection, and the inconsistent usage of golden passage in the training and\ninference phases.

One challenge for the CTR prediction task is to capture the\nreal interest of users from their clicked items, which is inherently biased by\npresented positions of items, i.e., more front positions tend to obtain higher\nCTR values. A popular line of existing works focuses on explicitly estimating\nposition bias by result randomization which is expensive and inefficient, or by\ninverse propensity weighting (IPW) which relies heavily on the quality of the\npropensity estimation. Another common solution is modeling position as features\nduring offline training and simply adopting fixed value or dropout tricks when\nserving.

For\nthis goal, we propose a privacy aware recommendation framework that gives users\ndelicate control over their personal data, including implicit behaviors, e.g.,\nclicks and watches. In this new framework, users can proactively control which\ndata to disclose based on the trade-off between anticipated privacy risks and\npotential utilities.

    "abstract": "Input features play a crucial role in the predictive performance of DNN-based\nindustrial recommender systems with thousands of categorical and continuous\nfields from users, items, contexts, and their interactions. Noisy features and\ninappropriate embedding dimension assignments can impair the performance of\nrecommender systems and introduce unnecessary complexity in model training and\nonline serving. Optimizing the input configuration of DNN models, including\nfeature selection and embedding dimension assignment, has become one of the\nessential topics in feature engineering. Typically, feature selection and\nembedding dimension search are optimized sequentially, i.e., feature selection\nis performed first, followed by embedding dimension search to determine the\noptimal dimension size for each selected feature. In contrast, this paper\nstudies the joint optimization of feature selection and embedding dimension\nsearch. To this end, we propose a differentiable neural \\textbf{i}nput\n\\textbf{razor}, namely \\textbf{i-Razor}. Specifically, inspired by recent\nadvances in neural architecture search, we introduce an end-to-end\ndifferentiable model to learn the relative importance between different\nembedding regions of each feature. Furthermore, a flexible pruning algorithm is\nproposed to simultaneously achieve feature filtering and dimension size\nderivation. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets in the\nClick-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction task demonstrate the efficacy and\nsuperiority of i-Razor in balancing model complexity and performance.",

    "abstract": "In classical planning, the goal is to derive a course of actions that allows\nan intelligent agent to move from any situation it finds itself in to one that\nsatisfies its goals. Classical planning is considered domain-independent, i.e.,\nit is not limited to a particular application and can be used to solve\ndifferent types of reasoning problems. In practice, however, some properties of\na planning problem at hand require an expressive extension of the standard\nclassical planning formalism to capture and model them. Although the importance\nof many of these extensions is well known, most planners, especially optimal\nplanners, do not support these extended planning formalisms. The lack of\nsupport not only limits the use of these planners for certain problems, but\neven if it is possible to model the problems without these extensions, it often\nleads to increased effort in modeling or makes modeling practically impossible\nas the required problem encoding size increases exponentially.\nIn this thesis, we propose to use symbolic search for cost-optimal planning\nfor different expressive extensions of classical planning, all capturing\ndifferent aspects of the problem. In particular, we study planning with axioms,\nplanning with state-dependent action costs, oversubscription planning, and\ntop-k planning. For all formalisms, we present complexity and compilability\nresults, highlighting that it is desirable and even necessary to natively\nsupport the corresponding features. We analyze symbolic heuristic search and\nshow that the search performance does not always benefit from the use of a\nheuristic and that the search performance can exponentially deteriorate even\nunder the best possible circumstances, namely the perfect heuristic. This\nreinforces that symbolic blind search is the dominant symbolic search strategy\nnowadays, on par with other state-of-the-art cost-optimal planning\nstrategies...",

    "title": "Selecting task with optimal transport self-supervised learning for  few-shot classification",
    "abstract": "Few-Shot classification aims at solving problems that only a few samples are\navailable in the training process. Due to the lack of samples, researchers\ngenerally employ a set of training tasks from other domains to assist the\ntarget task, where the distribution between assistant tasks and the target task\nis usually different. To reduce the distribution gap, several lines of methods\nhave been proposed, such as data augmentation and domain alignment. However,\none common drawback of these algorithms is that they ignore the similarity task\nselection before training. The fundamental problem is to push the auxiliary\ntasks close to the target task. In this paper, we propose a novel task\nselecting algorithm, named Optimal Transport Task Selecting (OTTS), to\nconstruct a training set by selecting similar tasks for Few-Shot learning.\nSpecifically, the OTTS measures the task similarity by calculating the optimal\ntransport distance and completes the model training via a self-supervised\nstrategy. By utilizing the selected tasks with OTTS, the training process of\nFew-Shot learning become more stable and effective. Other proposed methods\nincluding data augmentation and domain alignment can be used in the meantime\nwith OTTS. We conduct extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, including\nMiniImageNet, CIFAR, CUB, Cars, and Places, to evaluate the effectiveness of\nOTTS. Experimental results validate that our OTTS outperforms the typical\nbaselines, i.e., MAML, matchingnet, protonet, by a large margin (averagely\n1.72\\% accuracy improvement).",

    "abstract": "Neural networks (NNs) are already deployed in hardware today, becoming\nvaluable intellectual property (IP) as many hours are invested in their\ntraining and optimization. Therefore, attackers may be interested in copying,\nreverse engineering, or even modifying this IP. The current practices in\nhardware obfuscation, including the widely studied logic locking technique, are\ninsufficient to protect the actual IP of a well-trained NN: its weights. Simply\nhiding the weights behind a key-based scheme is inefficient (resource-hungry)\nand inadequate (attackers can exploit knowledge distillation). This paper\nproposes an intuitive method to poison the predictions that prevent\ndistillation-based attacks; this is the first work to consider such a poisoning\napproach in hardware-implemented NNs. The proposed technique obfuscates a NN so\nan attacker cannot train the NN entirely or accurately. We elaborate a threat\nmodel which highlights the difference between random logic obfuscation and the\nobfuscation of NN IP. Based on this threat model, our security analysis shows\nthat the poisoning successfully and significantly reduces the accuracy of the\nstolen NN model on various representative datasets. Moreover, the accuracy and\nprediction distributions are maintained, no functionality is disturbed, nor are\nhigh overheads incurred. Finally, we highlight that our proposed approach is\nflexible and does not require manipulation of the NN toolchain.",

    "abstract": "Actual causality and a closely related concept of responsibility attribution\nare central to accountable decision making. Actual causality focuses on\nspecific outcomes and aims to identify decisions (actions) that were critical\nin realizing an outcome of interest. Responsibility attribution is\ncomplementary and aims to identify the extent to which decision makers (agents)\nare responsible for this outcome. In this paper, we study these concepts under\na widely used framework for multi-agent sequential decision making under\nuncertainty: decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes\n(Dec-POMDPs). Following recent works in RL that show correspondence between\nPOMDPs and Structural Causal Models (SCMs), we first establish a connection\nbetween Dec-POMDPs and SCMs. This connection enables us to utilize a language\nfor describing actual causality from prior work and study existing definitions\nof actual causality in Dec-POMDPs. Given that some of the well-known\ndefinitions may lead to counter-intuitive actual causes, we introduce a novel\ndefinition that more explicitly accounts for causal dependencies between\nagents' actions. We then turn to responsibility attribution based on actual\ncausality, where we argue that in ascribing responsibility to an agent it is\nimportant to consider both the number of actual causes in which the agent\nparticipates, as well as its ability to manipulate its own degree of\nresponsibility. Motivated by these arguments we introduce a family of\nresponsibility attribution methods that extends prior work, while accounting\nfor the aforementioned considerations. Finally, through a simulation-based\nexperiment, we compare different definitions of actual causality and\nresponsibility attribution methods. The empirical results demonstrate the\nqualitative difference between the considered definitions of actual causality\nand their impact on attributed responsibility.",

    "title": "Unimodal-Concentrated Loss: Fully Adaptive Label Distribution Learning  for Ordinal Regression",
    "abstract": "Learning from a label distribution has achieved promising results on ordinal\nregression tasks such as facial age and head pose estimation wherein, the\nconcept of adaptive label distribution learning (ALDL) has drawn lots of\nattention recently for its superiority in theory. However, compared with the\nmethods assuming fixed form label distribution, ALDL methods have not achieved\nbetter performance. We argue that existing ALDL algorithms do not fully exploit\nthe intrinsic properties of ordinal regression. In this paper, we emphatically\nsummarize that learning an adaptive label distribution on ordinal regression\ntasks should follow three principles. First, the probability corresponding to\nthe ground-truth should be the highest in label distribution. Second, the\nprobabilities of neighboring labels should decrease with the increase of\ndistance away from the ground-truth, i.e., the distribution is unimodal. Third,\nthe label distribution should vary with samples changing, and even be distinct\nfor different instances with the same label, due to the different levels of\ndifficulty and ambiguity. Under the premise of these principles, we propose a\nnovel loss function for fully adaptive label distribution learning, namely\nunimodal-concentrated loss. Specifically, the unimodal loss derived from the\nlearning to rank strategy constrains the distribution to be unimodal.\nFurthermore, the estimation error and the variance of the predicted\ndistribution for a specific sample are integrated into the proposed\nconcentrated loss to make the predicted distribution maximize at the\nground-truth and vary according to the predicting uncertainty. Extensive\nexperimental results on typical ordinal regression tasks including age and head\npose estimation, show the superiority of our proposed unimodal-concentrated\nloss compared with existing loss functions.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a first step towards tuning observers for nonlinear\nsystems. Relying on recent results around Kazantzis-Kravaris/Luenberger (KKL)\nobservers, we propose to design a family of observers parametrized by the\ncut-off frequency of a linear filter. We use neural networks to learn the\nmapping between the observer and the nonlinear system as a function of this\nfrequency, and present a novel method to sample the state-space efficiently for\nnonlinear regression. We then propose a criterion related to noise sensitivity,\nwhich can be used to tune the observer by choosing the most appropriate\nfrequency. We illustrate the merits of this approach in numerical simulations.",

    "abstract": "In autonomous driving, LiDAR point-clouds and RGB images are two major data\nmodalities with complementary cues for 3D object detection. However, it is\nquite difficult to sufficiently use them, due to large inter-modal\ndiscrepancies. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, namely\nContrastively Augmented Transformer for multi-modal 3D object Detection\n(CAT-Det). Specifically, CAT-Det adopts a two-stream structure consisting of a\nPointformer (PT) branch, an Imageformer (IT) branch along with a Cross-Modal\nTransformer (CMT) module. PT, IT and CMT jointly encode intra-modal and\ninter-modal long-range contexts for representing an object, thus fully\nexploring multi-modal information for detection. Furthermore, we propose an\neffective One-way Multi-modal Data Augmentation (OMDA) approach via\nhierarchical contrastive learning at both the point and object levels,\nsignificantly improving the accuracy only by augmenting point-clouds, which is\nfree from complex generation of paired samples of the two modalities.

    "abstract": "We present a fast iterative solver for scattering problems in 2D, where a\npenetrable object with compact support is considered. By representing the\nscattered field as a volume potential in terms of the Green's function, we\narrive at the Lippmann-Schwinger equation in integral form, which is then\ndiscretized using an appropriate quadrature technique. The discretized linear\nsystem is then solved using an iterative solver accelerated by Directional\nAlgebraic Fast Multipole Method (DAFMM). The DAFMM presented here relies on the\ndirectional admissibility condition of the 2D Helmholtz kernel. And the\nconstruction of low-rank factorizations of the appropriate low-rank matrix\nsub-blocks is based on our new Nested Cross Approximation (NCA)~\\cite{\narXiv:2203.14832 [math.NA]}. The advantage of our new NCA is that the search\nspace of so-called far-field pivots is smaller than that of the existing NCAs.\nAnother significant contribution of this work is the use of HODLR based direct\nsolver as a preconditioner to further accelerate the iterative solver. In one\nof our numerical experiments, the iterative solver does not converge without a\npreconditioner. We show that the HODLR preconditioner is capable of solving\nproblems that the iterative solver can not. Another noteworthy contribution of\nthis article is that we perform a comparative study of the HODLR based fast\ndirect solver, DAFMM based fast iterative solver, and HODLR preconditioned\nDAFMM based fast iterative solver for the discretized Lippmann-Schwinger\nproblem. To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the first to provide\na systematic study and comparison of these different solvers for various\nproblem sizes and contrast functions.

    "abstract": "Cold-start issues have been more and more challenging for providing accurate\nrecommendations with the fast increase of users and items. Most existing\napproaches attempt to solve the intractable problems via content-aware\nrecommendations based on auxiliary information and/or cross-domain\nrecommendations with transfer learning. Their performances are often\nconstrained by the extremely sparse user-item interactions, unavailable side\ninformation, or very limited domain-shared users. Recently, meta-learners with\nmeta-augmentation by adding noises to labels have been proven to be effective\nto avoid overfitting and shown good performance on new tasks. Motivated by the\nidea of meta-augmentation, in this paper, by treating a user's preference over\nitems as a task, we propose a so-called Diverse Preference Augmentation\nframework with multiple source domains based on meta-learning (referred to as\nMetaDPA) to i) generate diverse ratings in a new domain of interest (known as\ntarget domain) to handle overfitting on the case of sparse interactions, and to\nii) learn a preference model in the target domain via a meta-learning scheme to\nalleviate cold-start issues. Specifically, we first conduct multi-source domain\nadaptation by dual conditional variational autoencoders and impose a\nMulti-domain InfoMax (MDI) constraint on the latent representations to learn\ndomain-shared and domain-specific preference properties. To avoid overfitting,\nwe add a Mutually-Exclusive (ME) constraint on the output of decoders to\ngenerate diverse ratings given content data. Finally, these generated diverse\nratings and the original ratings are introduced into the meta-training\nprocedure to learn a preference meta-learner, which produces good\ngeneralization ability on cold-start recommendation tasks. Experiments on\nreal-world datasets show our proposed MetaDPA clearly outperforms the current\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

Among available technologies to monitor\nforaging behavior, the acoustic method has been highly reliable and repeatable,\nbut can be subject to further computational improvements to increase precision\nand specificity of recognition of foraging activities. In this study, an\nalgorithm called Jaw Movement segment-based Foraging Activity Recognizer\n(JMFAR) is proposed. The method is based on the computation and analysis of\ntemporal, statistical and spectral features of jaw movement sounds for\ndetection of rumination and grazing bouts. They are called JM-segment features\nbecause they are extracted from a sound segment and expect to capture JM\ninformation of the whole segment rather than individual JMs. Two variants of\nthe method are proposed and tested: (i) the temporal and statistical features\nonly JMFAR-ns; and (ii) a feature selection process (JMFAR-sel). The JMFAR was\ntested on signals registered in a free grazing environment, achieving an\naverage weighted F1-score greater than 95%. Then, it was compared with a\nstate-of-the-art algorithm, showing improved performance for estimation of\ngrazing bouts (+19%). The JMFAR-ns variant reduced the computational cost by\n25.4%, but achieved a slightly lower performance than the JMFAR.

Compared with approaches where the\ndiscretization of both bulk and contact surfaces is based on collocation, the\nCCS approach does not need enhancements to remove oscillations for highly\nnon-uniform meshes. With respect to integral contact approaches, the CCS\nalgorithm is less expensive, easier to code and can be added to a pre-existing\nisogeometric analysis code with minimal effort.

The results of a storage and\ngeneration optimal expansion model with network effects for spatiotemporally\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous load profiles are compared. A case study is\nperformed using a 3-bus network of London, Manchester, and Glasgow in Britain\nfor load and weather data for representative weeks. Using heterogeneous heating\ndemand data changes storage sizing: under a business-as-usual budget, 26% more\ntotal storage is built on an energy and power basis, and this storage is\ndistributed among all of the buses in the heterogeneous case. Under a\nlow-carbon budget, total energy storage at all buses increases 2 times on an\nenergy basis and 40% on a power basis. The energy to power ratio of storage at\neach bus also increases when accounting for heterogeneity; this change suggests\nthat storage will be needed to provide energy support in addition to power\nsupport for electric heating in high-renewable power systems. Accounting for\nheterogeneity also increases modeled systems costs, particularly capital costs,\nbecause of the need for higher generation capacity in the largest load center\nand coincidence of local peak demand at different buses.

    "title": "A Robin-Neumann Scheme with Quasi-Newton Acceleration for Partitioned  Fluid-Structure Interaction",
    "abstract": "The Dirichlet-Neumann scheme is the most common partitioned algorithm for\nfluid-structure interaction (FSI) and offers high flexibility concerning the\nsolvers employed for the two subproblems. Nevertheless, it is not without\nshortcomings: To begin with, the inherent added-mass effect often destabilizes\nthe numerical solution severely. Moreover, the Dirichlet-Neumann scheme cannot\nbe applied to FSI problems in which an incompressible fluid is fully enclosed\nby Dirichlet boundaries, as it is incapable of satisfying the volume\nconstraint. In the last decade, interface quasi-Newton methods have proven to\ncontrol the added-mass effect and substantially speed up convergence by adding\na Newton-like update step to the Dirichlet-Neumann coupling. They are, however,\nwithout effect on the incompressibility dilemma. As an alternative, the\nRobin-Neumann scheme generalizes the fluid's boundary condition to a Robin\ncondition by including the Cauchy stresses. While this modification in fact\nsuccessfully tackles both drawbacks of the Dirichlet-Neumann approach, the\nprice to be paid is a strong dependency on the Robin weighting parameter, with\nvery limited a priori knowledge about good choices. This work proposes a\nstrategy to merge these two ideas and benefit from their combined strengths.\nThe effectiveness of this new quasi-Newton-accelerated Robin-Neumann scheme is\ndemonstrated for different FSI simulations and compared to both Robin- and\nDirichlet-Neumann variants.",

    "abstract": "Iris presentation attack detection (PAD) has achieved remarkable success to\nensure the reliability and security of iris recognition systems. Most existing\nmethods exploit discriminative features in the spatial domain and report\noutstanding performance under intra-dataset settings. However, the degradation\nof performance is inevitable under cross-dataset settings, suffering from\ndomain shift. In consideration of real-world applications, a small number of\nbonafide samples are easily accessible. We thus define a new domain adaptation\nsetting called Few-shot One-class Domain Adaptation (FODA), where adaptation\nonly relies on a limited number of target bonafide samples. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel FODA framework based on the expressive power of\nfrequency information. Specifically, our method integrates frequency-related\ninformation through two proposed modules. Frequency-based Attention Module\n(FAM) aggregates frequency information into spatial attention and explicitly\nemphasizes high-frequency fine-grained features. Frequency Mixing Module (FMM)\nmixes certain frequency components to generate large-scale target-style samples\nfor adaptation with limited target bonafide samples. Extensive experiments on\nLivDet-Iris 2017 dataset demonstrate the proposed method achieves\nstate-of-the-art or competitive performance under both cross-dataset and\nintra-dataset settings.",

However, many aspects with regard to\nsome unique properties of AUs, such as the regional and relational\ncharacteristics, are not sufficiently explored in previous works. Motivated by\nthis, we take the AU properties into consideration and propose two auxiliary AU\nrelated tasks to bridge the gap between limited annotations and the model\nperformance in a self-supervised manner via the unlabeled data.

Not only\ncan it be used to detect novel sceneries, either as out-of-distribution or\nanomaly sample, but it also helps to determine deficiencies in the training\ndata distribution. A lot of promising research directions have either proposed\ntraditional methods like Gaussian processes or extended deep learning based\napproaches, for example, by interpreting them from a Bayesian point of view. In\nthis work we propose a novel approach for uncertainty estimation based on\nautoencoder models: The recursive application of a previously trained\nautoencoder model can be interpreted as a dynamical system storing training\nexamples as attractors. While input images close to known samples will converge\nto the same or similar attractor, input samples containing unknown features are\nunstable and converge to different training samples by potentially removing or\nchanging characteristic features. The use of dropout during training and\ninference leads to a family of similar dynamical systems, each one being robust\non samples close to the training distribution but unstable on new features.\nEither the model reliably removes these features or the resulting instability\ncan be exploited to detect problematic input samples. We evaluate our approach\non several dataset combinations as well as on an industrial application for\noccupant classification in the vehicle interior for which we additionally\nrelease a new synthetic dataset.",

The two predominant approaches are pruning, which gradually\nremoves weights from a pre-trained model, and distillation, which trains a\nsmaller compact model to match a larger one.

However,\ncurrent approaches to forecasting the RF are complex and computationally\nexpensive.

    "title": "Transformers for 1D Signals in Parkinson's Disease Detection from Gait",
    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the detection of Parkinson's disease based on the\nanalysis of a patient's gait. The growing popularity and success of Transformer\nnetworks in natural language processing and image recognition motivated us to\ndevelop a novel method for this problem based on an automatic features\nextraction via Transformers. The use of Transformers in 1D signal is not really\nwidespread yet, but we show in this paper that they are effective in extracting\nrelevant features from 1D signals. As Transformers require a lot of memory, we\ndecoupled temporal and spatial information to make the model smaller. Our\narchitecture used temporal Transformers, dimension reduction layers to reduce\nthe dimension of the data, a spatial Transformer, two fully connected layers\nand an output layer for the final prediction. Our model outperforms the current\nstate-of-the-art algorithm with 95.2\\% accuracy in distinguishing a\nParkinsonian patient from a healthy one on the Physionet dataset. A key\nlearning from this work is that Transformers allow for greater stability in\nresults.

    "title": "A Fast and Efficient Conditional Learning for Tunable Trade-Off between  Accuracy and Robustness",
    "abstract": "Existing models that achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both\nclean and adversarially-perturbed images rely on convolution operations\nconditioned with feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers. These layers\nrequire many new parameters and are hyperparameter sensitive. They\nsignificantly increase training time, memory cost, and potential latency which\ncan prove costly for resource-limited or real-time applications. In this paper,\nwe present a fast learnable once-for-all adversarial training (FLOAT)\nalgorithm, which instead of the existing FiLM-based conditioning, presents a\nunique weight conditioned learning that requires no additional layer, thereby\nincurring no significant increase in parameter count, training time, or network\nlatency compared to standard adversarial training. In particular, we add\nconfigurable scaled noise to the weight tensors that enables a trade-off\nbetween clean and adversarial performance. Extensive experiments show that\nFLOAT can yield SOTA performance improving both clean and perturbed image\nclassification by up to ~6% and ~10%, respectively. Moreover, real hardware\nmeasurement shows that FLOAT can reduce the training time by up to 1.43x with\nfewer model parameters of up to 1.47x on iso-hyperparameter settings compared\nto the FiLM-based alternatives. Additionally, to further improve memory\nefficiency we introduce FLOAT sparse (FLOATS), a form of non-iterative model\npruning and provide detailed empirical analysis to provide a three way\naccuracy-robustness-complexity trade-off for these new class of pruned\nconditionally trained models.",

    "title": "Sense disambiguation of compound constituents",
    "abstract": "In distributional semantic accounts of the meaning of noun-noun compounds\n(e.g. starfish, bank account, houseboat) the important role of constituent\npolysemy remains largely unaddressed(cf. the meaning of star in starfish vs.\nstar cluster vs. star athlete). Instead of semantic vectors that average over\nthe different meanings of a constituent, disambiguated vectors of the\nconstituents would be needed in order to see what these more specific\nconstituent meanings contribute to the meaning of the compound as a whole. This\npaper presents a novel approach to this specific problem of word sense\ndisambiguation: set expansion. We build on the approach developed by Mahabal et\nal. (2018) which was originally designed to solve the analogy problem. We\nmodified their method in such a way that it can address the problem of sense\ndisambiguation of compound constituents. The results of experiments with a data\nset of almost 9000 compounds (LADEC, Gagn\\'e et al. 2019) suggest that this\napproach is successful, yet the success is sensitive to the frequency with\nwhich the compounds are attested.",

    "abstract": "Model-based feedforward control improves tracking performance of motion\nsystems, provided that the model describing the inverse dynamics is of\nsufficient accuracy. Model sets, such as neural networks (NNs) and\nphysics-guided neural networks (PGNNs) are typically used as flexible\nparametrizations that enable accurate identification of the inverse system\ndynamics. Currently, these (PG)NNs are used to identify the inverse dynamics\ndirectly. However, direct identification of the inverse dynamics is sensitive\nto noise that is present in the training data, and thereby results in biased\nparameter estimates which limit the achievable tracking performance. In order\nto push performance further, it is therefore crucial to account for noise when\nperforming the identification. To address this problem, this paper proposes the\nuse of a forward system identification using (PG)NNs from noisy data.\nAfterwards, two methods are proposed for inverting PGNNs to design a\nfeedforward controller for high-precision motion control. The developed\nmethodology is validated on a real-life industrial linear motor, where it\nshowed significant improvements in tracking performance with respect to the\ndirect inverse identification.",

    "abstract": "Exemplar-based image translation establishes dense correspondences between a\nconditional input and an exemplar (from two different domains) for leveraging\ndetailed exemplar styles to achieve realistic image translation. Existing work\nbuilds the cross-domain correspondences implicitly by minimizing feature-wise\ndistances across the two domains. Without explicit exploitation of\ndomain-invariant features, this approach may not reduce the domain gap\neffectively which often leads to sub-optimal correspondences and image\ntranslation. We design a Marginal Contrastive Learning Network (MCL-Net) that\nexplores contrastive learning to learn domain-invariant features for realistic\nexemplar-based image translation. Specifically, we design an innovative\nmarginal contrastive loss that guides to establish dense correspondences\nexplicitly. Nevertheless, building correspondence with domain-invariant\nsemantics alone may impair the texture patterns and lead to degraded texture\ngeneration. We thus design a Self-Correlation Map (SCM) that incorporates scene\nstructures as auxiliary information which improves the built correspondences\nsubstantially. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on multifarious image\ntranslation tasks show that the proposed method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art consistently.",

    "abstract": "Aphasia is a common speech and language disorder, typically caused by a brain\ninjury or a stroke, that affects millions of people worldwide. Detecting and\nassessing Aphasia in patients is a difficult, time-consuming process, and\nnumerous attempts to automate it have been made, the most successful using\nmachine learning models trained on aphasic speech data. Like in many medical\napplications, aphasic speech data is scarce and the problem is exacerbated in\nso-called \"low resource\" languages, which are, for this task, most languages\nexcluding English. We attempt to leverage available data in English and achieve\nzero-shot aphasia detection in low-resource languages such as Greek and French,\nby using language-agnostic linguistic features. Current cross-lingual aphasia\ndetection approaches rely on manually extracted transcripts. We propose an\nend-to-end pipeline using pre-trained Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models\nthat share cross-lingual speech representations and are fine-tuned for our\ndesired low-resource languages. To further boost our ASR model's performance,\nwe also combine it with a language model.

    "title": "An image classification approach for hole detection in wireless sensor  networks",
    "abstract": "Hole detection is a crucial task for monitoring the status of wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) which often consist of low-capability sensors. Holes can form in\nWSNs due to the problems during placement of the sensors or power/hardware\nfailure. In these situations, sensing or transmitting data could be affected\nand can interrupt the normal operation of the WSNs. It may also decrease the\nlifetime of the network and sensing coverage of the sensors. The problem of\nhole detection is especially challenging in WSNs since the exact location of\nthe sensors is often unknown. In this paper, we propose a novel hole detection\napproach called FD-CNN which is based on Force-directed (FD) Algorithm and\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN). In contrast to existing approaches, FD-CNN\nis a centralized approach and is able to detect holes from WSNs without relying\non the information related to the location of the sensors. The proposed\napproach also alleviates the problem of high computational complexity in\ndistributed approaches. The proposed approach accepts the network topology of a\nWSN as an input and generates the identity of the nodes surrounding each\ndetected hole in the network as the final output. In the proposed approach, an\nFD algorithm is used to generate the layout of the wireless sensor networks\nfollowed by the identification of the holes in the layouts using a trained CNN\nmodel. In order to prepare labeled datasets for training the CNN model, an\nunsupervised pre-processing method is also proposed in this paper. After the\nholes are detected by the CNN model, two algorithms are proposed to identify\nthe regions of the holes and corresponding nodes surrounding the regions.\nExtensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach based on\ndifferent datasets. Experimental results show that FD-CNN can achieve 80%\nsensitivity and 93% specificity in less than 2 minutes.",

    "abstract": "Scientific collaboration at international level has increased manifolds\nduring last two decades. Collaboration is not only associated with higher\nresearch productivity but has also been found to be positively correlated with\nimpact. Considering the benefits and advantages of international collaboration\nfor the national science and technology systems of a country, policymakers in\ndifferent countries have designed programs to promote international\ncollaboration in science. Several proximity dimensions: mainly geographical,\ncognitive, institutional, social, and economic, are found to shape and drive\nthe international collaborations. This paper attempts to measure and\ncharacterize the international collaboration patterns in Indian scientific\nresearch. Research publication data for the last 20 years (2001-2020), obtained\nfrom Web of Science, is analysed for the purpose. Analytical results show that\nIndian international collaboration has grown at a rate of 12.27% during this\nperiod, rising from only 20.73% internationally collaborated papers in 2001 to\n32.35% internationally collaborated papers in 2020. USA, Germany, England,\nSouth Korea and China are found to be the top 5 major collaborating partners\nfor India during his period, however, some subject area-wise variations are\nalso seen. Among the internationally collaborated papers, about 50% papers have\nan Indian researcher as lead (first) author, and more than 50% authors of such\ninternationally collaborated papers are from India. The internationally\ncollaborated papers from India are also found to have a slight advantage in\nterms of citation impact and social media visibility.

    "abstract": "Force-directed (FD) algorithms can be used to explore relationships in social\nnetworks, visualize money markets, and analyze transaction networks. However,\nFD algorithms are mainly designed for visualizing static graphs in which the\ntopology of the networks remains constant throughout the calculation. In\ncontrast to static graphs, nodes and edges in dynamic graphs can be added or\nremoved as time progresses. In these situations, existing FD algorithms do not\nscale well, since any changes in the topology will trigger these algorithms to\ncompletely restart the entire computation. To alleviate this problem, we\npropose a design and implementation of five online FD algorithms to visualize\ndynamic graphs while maintaining their native force models. The online FD\nalgorithms developed in this paper are able to reuse the force models of\nexisting FD algorithms without significant modifications. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach, online FD algorithms are compared\nagainst static FD algorithms for visualizing dynamic graphs. Experimental\nresults show that among the five algorithms evaluated, the online FD algorithm\nachieves the best number of edge crossings and the standard deviation of edge\nlengths for visualizing dynamic graphs.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in fake news detection have exploited the success of\nlarge-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs). The predominant\nstate-of-the-art approaches are based on fine-tuning PLMs on labelled fake news\ndatasets. However, large-scale PLMs are generally not trained on structured\nfactual data and hence may not possess priors that are grounded in factually\naccurate knowledge. The use of existing knowledge bases (KBs) with rich\nhuman-curated factual information has thus the potential to make fake news\ndetection more effective and robust. In this paper, we investigate the impact\nof knowledge integration into PLMs for fake news detection. We study several\nstate-of-the-art approaches for knowledge integration, mostly using Wikidata as\nKB, on two popular fake news datasets - LIAR, a politics-based dataset, and\nCOVID-19, a dataset of messages posted on social media relating to the COVID-19\npandemic. Our experiments show that knowledge-enhanced models can significantly\nimprove fake news detection on LIAR where the KB is relevant and up-to-date.\nThe mixed results on COVID-19 highlight the reliance on stylistic features and\nthe importance of domain specific and current KBs.",

Amongst these, constant function market maker (CFMM) DEXs such as\nUniswap handle the most volume of trades between ERC-20 tokens. With the\nintroduction of Uniswap v3, liquidity providers are given the option to\ndifferentially allocate liquidity to be used for trades that occur within\nspecific price intervals. In this paper, we formalize the profit and loss that\nliquidity providers can earn when providing specific liquidity positions to a\ncontract. With this in hand, we are able to compute optimal liquidity\nallocations for liquidity providers who hold beliefs over how prices evolve\nover time. Ultimately, we use this tool to shed light on the design question\nregarding how v3 contracts should partition price space for permissible\nliquidity allocations. Our results show that a richer space of potential\npartitions can simultaneously benefit both liquidity providers and traders.",

    "abstract": "Products codes (PCs) are conventionally decoded with efficient iterative\nbounded-distance decoding (iBDD) based on hard-decision channel outputs which\nentails a performance loss compared to a soft-decision decoder. Recently,\nseveral hybrid algorithms have been proposed aimed to improve the performance\nof iBDD decoders via the aid of a certain amount of soft information while\nkeeping the decoding complexity similarly low as in iBDD. We propose a novel\nhybrid low-complexity decoder for PCs based on error-and-erasure (EaE) decoding\nand dynamic reliability scores (DRSs). This decoder is based on a novel EaE\ncomponent code decoder, which is able to decode beyond the designed distance of\nthe component code but suffers from an increased miscorrection probability. The\nDRSs, reflecting the reliability of a codeword bit, are used to detect and\navoid miscorrections. Simulation results show that this policy can reduce the\nmiscorrection rate significantly and improves the decoding performance. The\ndecoder requires only ternary message passing and a slight increase of\ncomputational complexity compared to iBDD, which makes it suitable for\nhigh-speed communication systems. Coding gains of up to 1.2 dB compared to the\nconventional iBDD decoder are observed.",

To analyze\nhow this ambiguity (also known as intrinsic uncertainty) shapes the\ndistribution learned by neural sequence models we measure sentence-level\nuncertainty by computing the degree of overlap between references in\nmulti-reference test sets from two different NLP tasks: machine translation\n(MT) and grammatical error correction (GEC). At both the sentence- and the\ntask-level, intrinsic uncertainty has major implications for various aspects of\nsearch such as the inductive biases in beam search and the complexity of exact\nsearch. In particular, we show that well-known pathologies such as a high\nnumber of beam search errors, the inadequacy of the mode, and the drop in\nsystem performance with large beam sizes apply to tasks with high level of\nambiguity such as MT but not to less uncertain tasks such as GEC. Furthermore,\nwe propose a novel exact $n$-best search algorithm for neural sequence models,\nand show that intrinsic uncertainty affects model uncertainty as the model\ntends to overly spread out the probability mass for uncertain tasks and\nsentences.",

Upon this new dataset, we propose three tasks supporting the\ndevelopment of a more fine-grained, robust, and human-like understanding of\nvideos through status changes.

In this paper, a novel\ntopology-optimized federated edge learning (TOFEL) scheme is proposed to tackle\nthe heterogeneity issue in federated learning and to improve the\ncommunication-and-computation efficiency. Specifically, a problem of jointly\noptimizing the aggregation topology and computing speed is formulated to\nminimize the weighted summation of energy consumption and latency. To solve the\nmixed-integer nonlinear problem, we propose a novel solution method of\npenalty-based successive convex approximation, which converges to a stationary\npoint of the primal problem under mild conditions. To facilitate real-time\ndecision making, an imitation-learning based method is developed, where deep\nneural networks (DNNs) are trained offline to mimic the penalty-based method,\nand the trained imitation DNNs are deployed at the edge devices for online\ninference. Thereby, an efficient imitate-learning based approach is seamlessly\nintegrated into the TOFEL framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed TOFEL scheme accelerates the federated learning process, and achieves\na higher energy efficiency.

    "abstract": "Efficient load forecasting is needed to ensure better observability in the\ndistribution networks, whereas such forecasting is made possible by an\nincreasing number of smart meter installations. Because distribution networks\ninclude a large amount of different loads at various aggregation levels, such\nas individual consumers, transformer stations and feeders loads, it is\nimpractical to develop individual (or so-called local) forecasting models for\neach load separately. Furthermore, such local models ignore the strong\ndependencies between different loads that might be present due to their spatial\nproximity and the characteristics of the distribution network. To address these\nissues, this paper proposes a global modeling approach based on deep learning\nfor efficient forecasting of a large number of loads in distribution networks.\nIn this way, the computational burden of training a large amount of local\nforecasting models can be largely reduced, and the cross-series information\nshared among different loads can be utilized. Additionally, an unsupervised\nlocalization mechanism and optimal ensemble construction strategy are also\nproposed to localize/personalize the forecasting model to different groups of\nloads and to improve the forecasting accuracy further.

The procedure, also known as contrast sets mining, is\napplied in a wide range of areas like medicine, industry, or economics. In the\npaper we present RuleKit-CS, an algorithm for contrast set mining based on a\nsequential covering - a well established heuristic for decision rule induction.\nMultiple passes accompanied with an attribute penalization scheme allow\ngenerating contrast sets describing same examples with different attributes,\nunlike the standard sequential covering. The ability to identify contrast sets\nin regression and survival data sets, the feature not provided by the existing\nalgorithms, further extends the usability of RuleKit-CS. Experiments on wide\nrange of data sets confirmed RuleKit-CS to be a useful tool for discovering\ndifferences between defined groups.

Researchers\nrecently worked toward realising logic gates made by neurons to develop novel\ndevices such as organic neuroprostheses or brain implants made by cells, herein\ntermed as living implants. Several challenges arise from this approach, mainly\nassociated with the stochastic nature and noise of neuronal communication.\nSince astrocytes play a crucial role in the regulation of neurons activity,\nthere is a possibility whereby astrocytes can be engineered to control synapses\nfavouring reliable biocomputing. This work proposes a mathematical model of\nneuronal logic gates involving neurons and astrocytes, realising OR and AND\ngating. We use a shallow coupling of both the Izhikevich and Postnov models to\ncharacterise gating responses with spike pattern variability and astrocyte\nsynaptic regulation.

Ensuring safety of\ninterconnected systems whose dynamics are coupled is challenging because the\neffects of faults and attacks in one sub-system can propagate to other\nsub-systems and lead to safety violations. In this paper, we study the problem\nof safety-critical control for CPS with coupled dynamics when some sub-systems\nare subject to failure or attack. We first propose resilient-safety indices\n(RSIs) for the faulty or compromised sub-systems that bound the worst-case\nimpacts of faulty or compromised sub-systems on a set of specified safety\nconstraints. By incorporating the RSIs, we provide a sufficient condition for\nthe synthesis of control policies in each failure- and attack- free\nsub-systems. The synthesized control policies compensate for the impacts of the\nfaulty or compromised sub-systems to guarantee safety. We formulate\nsum-of-square optimization programs to compute the RSIs and the safety-ensuring\ncontrol policies. We present a case study that applies our proposed approach on\nthe temperature regulation of three coupled rooms.

Existing clique model mainly focuses on unsigned networks.\nHowever, in real world, many applications are modeled as signed networks with\npositive and negative edges. As the signed networks hold their own properties\ndifferent from the unsigned networks, the existing clique model is inapplicable\nfor the signed networks. Motivated by this, we propose the balanced clique\nmodel that considers the most fundamental and dominant theory, structural\nbalance theory, for signed networks. Following the balanced clique model, we\nstudy the maximal balanced clique enumeration problem (MBCE) which computes all\nthe maximal balanced cliques in a given signed network and the maximum balanced\nclique search problem (MBCS) which computes the balanced clique with maximum\nsize. We show that MBCE problem and MBCS problem are both NP-Hard. For the MBCE\nproblem, a straightforward solution is to treat the signed network as two\nunsigned networks and leverage the off-the-shelf techniques for unsigned\nnetworks. However, such a solution is inefficient for large signed networks. To\naddress this problem, in this paper, we first propose a new maximal balanced\nclique enumeration algorithm by exploiting the unique properties of signed\nnetworks. Based on the new proposed algorithm, we devise two optimization\nstrategies to further improve the efficiency of the enumeration. For the MBCS\nproblem, we propose a new search framework based on search space partition. To\nfurther improve the efficiency of the new framework, we propose multiple\noptimization strategies regarding to redundant search branches and invalid\ncandidates.

Local differential privacy (LDP) is a promising solution to\nprivacy-preserving data collection and analysis. However, existing few LDP\nstudies over streams are either applicable to finite streams only or suffering\nfrom insufficient protection. This paper investigates this problem by proposing\nLDP-IDS, a novel $w$-event LDP paradigm to provide practical privacy guarantee\nfor infinite streams at users end, and adapting the popular budget division\nframework in centralized differential privacy (CDP). By constructing a unified\nerror analysi for LDP, we first develop two adatpive budget division-based LDP\nmethods for LDP-IDS that can enhance data utility via leveraging the\nnon-deterministic sparsity in streams. Beyond that, we further propose a novel\npopulation division framework that can not only avoid the high sensitivity of\nLDP noise to budget division but also require significantly less communication.\nBased on the framework, we also present two adaptive population division\nmethods for LDP-IDS with theoretical analysis. We conduct extensive experiments\non synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and\nefficiency pf our proposed frameworks and methods.

It usually requires to incorporate the sensitive attribute\nlabels as prediction targets. However, in many scenarios the sensitive\nattribute labels of many samples can be unknown, and it is difficult to train a\nstrong discriminator based on the scarce data with observed attribute labels,\nwhich may lead to generate unfair representations. In this paper, we propose a\nsemi-supervised fair representation learning approach based on adversarial\nvariational autoencoder, which can reduce the dependency of adversarial fair\nmodels on data with labeled sensitive attributes. More specifically, we use a\nbias-aware model to capture inherent bias information on sensitive attribute by\naccurately predicting sensitive attributes from input data, and we use a\nbias-free model to learn debiased fair representations by using adversarial\nlearning to remove bias information from them. The hidden representations\nlearned by the two models are regularized to be orthogonal. In addition, the\nsoft labels predicted by the two models are further integrated into a\nsemi-supervised variational autoencoder to reconstruct the input data, and we\napply an additional entropy regularization to encourage the attribute labels\ninferred from the bias-free model to be high-entropy. In this way, the\nbias-aware model can better capture attribute information while the bias-free\nmodel is less discriminative on sensitive attributes if the input data is well\nreconstructed. Extensive experiments on two datasets for different tasks\nvalidate that our approach can achieve good representation learning fairness\nunder limited data with sensitive attribute labels.",

In this paper, we propose FairRank, which is a fairness-aware\nsingle-tower ranking framework for news recommendation. Since candidate news\nselection can be biased, we propose to use a shared candidate-aware user model\nto match user interest with a real displayed candidate news and a random news,\nrespectively, to learn a candidate-aware user embedding that reflects user\ninterest in candidate news and a candidate-invariant user embedding that\nindicates intrinsic user interest. We apply adversarial learning to both of\nthem to reduce the biases brought by sensitive user attributes. In addition, we\nuse a KL loss to regularize the attribute labels inferred from the two user\nembeddings to be similar, which can make the model capture less candidate-aware\nbias information. Extensive experiments on two datasets show that FairRank can\nimprove the fairness of various single-tower news ranking models with minor\nperformance losses.",

    "title": "A Novel Multimodal Approach for Studying the Dynamics of Curiosity in  Small Group Learning",
    "abstract": "Curiosity is a vital metacognitive skill in educational contexts, leading to\ncreativity, and a love of learning. And while many school systems increasingly\nundercut curiosity by teaching to the test, teachers are increasingly\ninterested in how to evoke curiosity in their students to prepare them for a\nworld in which lifelong learning and reskilling will be more and more\nimportant. One aspect of curiosity that has received little attention, however,\nis the role of peers in eliciting curiosity. We present what we believe to be\nthe first theoretical framework that articulates an integrated socio-cognitive\naccount of curiosity that ties observable behaviors in peers to underlying\ncuriosity states. We make a bipartite distinction between individual and\ninterpersonal functions that contribute to curiosity, and multimodal behaviors\nthat fulfill these functions. We validate the proposed framework by leveraging\na longitudinal latent variable modeling approach. Findings confirm a positive\npredictive relationship between the latent variables of individual and\ninterpersonal functions and curiosity, with the interpersonal functions\nexercising a comparatively stronger influence. Prominent behavioral\nrealizations of these functions are also discovered in a data-driven manner. We\ninstantiate the proposed theoretical framework in a set of strategies and\ntactics that can be incorporated into learning technologies to indicate, evoke,\nand scaffold curiosity. This work is a step towards designing learning\ntechnologies that can recognize and evoke moment-by-moment curiosity during\nlearning in social contexts and towards a more complete multimodal learning\nanalytics. The underlying rationale is applicable more generally for developing\ncomputer support for other metacognitive and socio-emotional skills.",

    "abstract": "Ensemble knowledge distillation can extract knowledge from multiple teacher\nmodels and encode it into a single student model. Many existing methods learn\nand distill the student model on labeled data only. However, the teacher models\nare usually learned on the same labeled data, and their predictions have high\ncorrelations with groudtruth labels. Thus, they cannot provide sufficient\nknowledge complementary to task labels for student teaching. Distilling on\nunseen unlabeled data has the potential to enhance the knowledge transfer from\nthe teachers to the student. In this paper, we propose a unified and effective\nensemble knowledge distillation method that distills a single student model\nfrom an ensemble of teacher models on both labeled and unlabeled data. Since\ndifferent teachers may have diverse prediction correctness on the same sample,\non labeled data we weight the predictions of different teachers according to\ntheir correctness. In addition, we weight the distillation loss based on the\noverall prediction correctness of the teacher ensemble to distill high-quality\nknowledge. On unlabeled data, there is no groundtruth to evaluate prediction\ncorrectness. Fortunately, the disagreement among teachers is an indication of\nsample hardness, and thereby we weight the distillation loss based on teachers'\ndisagreement to emphasize knowledge distillation on important samples.\nExtensive experiments on four datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed\nensemble distillation method.",

First, we present a dememorization\ntechnique for these equations. We show that the convection-diffusion equations\nwith memory effects can be written as a system of standard\nconvection-diffusion-reaction equations. This allows removing the memory term\nand simplifying the computations. We consider a relation between dememorized\nequations and micro-scale equations, which do not contain memory terms.

The latter is introduced for problems in multiscale media with\nhigh-contrast properties. Because of high contrast, explicit methods are\nrestrictive and require time steps that are very small (scales as the inverse\nof the contrast). We show that, by appropriately decomposing the space, we can\ntreat only a few degrees of freedom implicitly and the remaining degrees of\nfreedom explicitly. We present a stability analysis.

Existing E2E SLU models usually\nfollow a two-stage configuration where an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)\nnetwork first predicts a transcript which is then passed to a Natural Language\nUnderstanding (NLU) module through an interface to infer semantic labels, such\nas intent and slot tags. This design, however, does not consider the NLU\nposterior while making transcript predictions, nor correct the NLU prediction\nerror immediately by considering the previously predicted word-pieces.

    "abstract": "Auxiliary tasks have been argued to be useful for representation learning in\nreinforcement learning. Although many auxiliary tasks have been empirically\nshown to be effective for accelerating learning on the main task, it is not yet\nclear what makes useful auxiliary tasks. Some of the most promising results are\non the pixel control, reward prediction, and the next state prediction\nauxiliary tasks; however, the empirical results are mixed, showing substantial\nimprovements in some cases and marginal improvements in others. Careful\ninvestigations of how auxiliary tasks help the learning of the main task is\nnecessary. In this paper, we take a step studying the effect of the target\npolicies on the usefulness of the auxiliary tasks formulated as general value\nfunctions. General value functions consist of three core elements: 1) policy 2)\ncumulant 3) continuation function. Our focus on the role of the target policy\nof the auxiliary tasks is motivated by the fact that the target policy\ndetermines the behavior about which the agent wants to make a prediction and\nthe state-action distribution that the agent is trained on, which further\naffects the main task learning. Our study provides insights about questions\nsuch as: Does a greedy policy result in bigger improvement gains compared to\nother policies? Is it best to set the auxiliary task policy to be the same as\nthe main task policy? Does the choice of the target policy have a substantial\neffect on the achieved performance gain or simple strategies for setting the\npolicy, such as using a uniformly random policy, work as well? Our empirical\nresults suggest that: 1) Auxiliary tasks with the greedy policy tend to be\nuseful. 2) Most policies, including a uniformly random policy, tend to improve\nover the baseline. 3) Surprisingly, the main task policy tends to be less\nuseful compared to other policies.",

We have identified a\nparticular set of problems that have so far been overlooked by previous works.\nWe present our solution for the global path planning problem for each agent and\nensure smooth local collision avoidance for each pair of agents in the scene.\nWe accomplish this by modeling the trajectories of the agents through 2D space\nand time as curves in 3D. Global path planning is solved using a modified\nDjikstra's algorithm to ensure that initial trajectories for agents do not\nintersect. We then solve for smooth local trajectories using a quasi-Newton\ninterior point solver, providing the trajectory curves with a radius to turn\nthem into rods. Subsequently, resolving collision of the rods ensures that no\ntwo agents are in the same spatial position at the same time.

Works in theoretical\nmodels, ontologies, and provenance analysis have greatly described means to\nstructure and understand the connection between knowledge generation and VA\nworkflows. Yet, two concepts are typically intermixed: the temporal aspect,\nwhich indicates sequences of events, and the atemporal aspect, which indicates\nthe workflow state space. In works where these concepts are separated, they do\nnot discuss how to analyze the recorded user's knowledge gathering process when\ncompared to the VA workflow itself. This paper presents Visual Analytic\nKnowledge Graph (VAKG), a conceptual framework that generalizes existing\nknowledge models and ontologies by focusing on how humans relate to computer\nprocesses temporally and how it relates to the workflow's state space. Our\nproposal structures this relationship as a 4-way temporal knowledge graph with\nspecific emphasis on modeling the human and computer aspect of VA as separate\nbut interconnected graphs for, among others, analytical purposes. We compare\nVAKG with relevant literature to show that VAKG's contribution allows VA\napplications to use it as a provenance model and a state space graph, allowing\nfor analytics of domain-specific processes, usage patterns, and users'\nknowledge gain performance.

A single\nmalicious agent is able to drive an averaging-based distributed learning\nalgorithm to an arbitrarily poor model. This has motivated the development of\nrobust aggregation schemes, which are based on variations of the median and\ntrimmed mean. While such procedures ensure robustness to outliers and malicious\nbehavior, they come at the cost of significantly reduced sample efficiency.\nThis means that current robust aggregation schemes require significantly higher\nagent participation rates to achieve a given level of performance than their\nmean-based counterparts in non-contaminated settings.

    "abstract": "Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) is a well known and very successful\ndata-driven control design method. It has been initially conceived for linear\nplants and this original formulation has been much explored in the literature,\nbesides having already found many practical applications. A nonlinear version\nof VRFT has been proposed early on, but not much explored later on. In this\npaper we highlight various issues involved in the application of nonlinear VRFT\nand propose the inclusion of L1 regularization in its formulation. We\nillustrate by means of two simple examples the critical role played by two\naspects: the L1 regularization and the choice of dictionary used to describe\nthe nonlinearity of the controller.",

    "abstract": "The prevailing methodology for analyzing population games and evolutionary\ndynamics in the large population limit assumes that a Poisson process (or\nclock) inherent to each agent determines when the agent can revise its\nstrategy. Hence, such an approach presupposes exponentially distributed\ninter-revision intervals, and is inadequate for cases where each strategy\nentails a sequence of sub-tasks (sub-strategies) that must be completed before\na new revision time occurs. This article proposes a methodology for such cases\nunder the premise that a sub-strategy's duration is exponentially-distributed,\nleading to Erlang distributed inter-revision intervals. We assume that a\nso-called pairwise-comparison protocol captures the agents' revision\npreferences to render our analysis concrete. The presence of sub-strategies\nbrings on additional dynamics that is incompatible with existing models and\nresults. Our main contributions are twofold, both derived for a deterministic\napproximation valid for large populations. We prove convergence of the\npopulation's state to the Nash equilibrium set when a potential game generates\na payoff for the strategies. We use system-theoretic passivity to determine\nconditions under which this convergence is guaranteed for contractive games.",

    "abstract": "Large neural networks excel in many domains, but they are expensive to train\nand fine-tune. A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory\nrequirements is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g.,\nsparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread\nadoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality\ntradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable\nalgorithms to approximate a given dense weight matrix. To address these issues,\nwe propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are\nparameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware\nutilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms).\nSurprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch\nmatrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These properties\nof Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense\nmodels. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable\naccuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training\napplications: speeding up ViT and GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and\nWikitext-103 language modeling by 2x with comparable model quality, and\nreducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In\nsparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique called \"reverse\nsparsification,\" Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate representation\nto speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality drop. The\nsame technique brings 23% faster BERT pretraining than even the very optimized\nimplementation from Nvidia that set the MLPerf 1.1 record. In dense-to-sparse\nfine-tuning, as a proof-of-concept, our Monarch approximation algorithm speeds\nup BERT fine-tuning on GLUE by 1.7x with comparable accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Large foundation models can exhibit unique capabilities depending on the\ndomain of data they are trained on. While these domains are generic, they may\nonly barely overlap. For example, visual-language models (VLMs) are trained on\nInternet-scale image captions, but large language models (LMs) are further\ntrained on Internet-scale text with no images (e.g. from spreadsheets, to SAT\nquestions). As a result, these models store different forms of commonsense\nknowledge across different domains. In this work, we show that this model\ndiversity is symbiotic, and can be leveraged to build AI systems with\nstructured Socratic dialogue -- in which new multimodal tasks are formulated as\na guided language-based exchange between different pre-existing foundation\nmodels, without additional finetuning. In the context of egocentric perception,\nwe present a case study of Socratic Models (SMs) that can provide meaningful\nresults for complex tasks such as generating free-form answers to contextual\nquestions about egocentric video, by formulating video Q&A as short story Q&A,\ni.e. summarizing the video into a short story, then answering questions about\nit. Additionally, SMs can generate captions for Internet images, and are\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art on zero-shot video-to-text retrieval with\n42.8 R@1 on MSR-VTT 1k-A.

Such networks are conceptually\nsymmetric with two parallel encoders, but often practically asymmetric as\nnumerous mechanisms are devised to break the symmetry. In this work, we conduct\na formal study on the importance of asymmetry by explicitly distinguishing the\ntwo encoders within the network -- one produces source encodings and the other\ntargets. Our key insight is keeping a relatively lower variance in target than\nsource generally benefits learning. This is empirically justified by our\nresults from five case studies covering different variance-oriented designs,\nand is aligned with our preliminary theoretical analysis on the baseline.\nMoreover, we find the improvements from asymmetric designs generalize well to\nlonger training schedules, multiple other frameworks and newer backbones.\nFinally, the combined effect of several asymmetric designs achieves a\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet linear probing and competitive results on\ndownstream transfer.

Exponential savings in label\ncomplexity are provably guaranteed in very special cases, but fundamental lower\nbounds show that such improvements are impossible in general. This suggests a\nneed to explore alternative goals for active learning. Learning with abstention\nis one such alternative. In this setting, the active learning algorithm may\nabstain from prediction in certain cases and incur an error that is marginally\nsmaller than $\\frac{1}{2}$.

Furthermore, the algorithm is\nguaranteed to only abstain on hard examples (where the true label distribution\nis close to a fair coin), a novel property we term \"proper abstention\" that\nalso leads to a host of other desirable characteristics. The option to abstain\nreduces the label complexity by an exponential factor, with no assumptions on\nthe distribution, relative to passive learning algorithms and/or active\nlearning that are not allowed to abstain. A key feature of the algorithm is\nthat it avoids the undesirable \"noise-seeking\" behavior often seen in active\nlearning.

Examples include the prediction of properties, the discovery\nof new reaction pathways, or the design of new molecules. The machine needs to\nread and write fluently in a chemical language for each of these tasks. Strings\nare a common tool to represent molecular graphs, and the most popular molecular\nstring representation, SMILES, has powered cheminformatics since the late\n1980s. However, in the context of AI and ML in chemistry, SMILES has several\nshortcomings -- most pertinently, most combinations of symbols lead to invalid\nresults with no valid chemical interpretation. To overcome this issue, a new\nlanguage for molecules was introduced in 2020 that guarantees 100\\% robustness:\nSELFIES (SELF-referencIng Embedded Strings). SELFIES has since simplified and\nenabled numerous new applications in chemistry. In this manuscript, we look to\nthe future and discuss molecular string representations, along with their\nrespective opportunities and challenges.

    "abstract": "How important are different temporal speech modulations for speech\nrecognition? We answer this question from two complementary perspectives.\nFirstly, we quantify the amount of phonetic information in the modulation\nspectrum of speech by computing the mutual information between temporal\nmodulations with frame-wise phoneme labels. Looking from another perspective,\nwe ask - which speech modulations does an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)\nsystem prefer for its operation. Data-driven weights are learnt over the\nmodulation spectrum and optimized for an end-to-end ASR task. Both methods\nunanimously agree that speech information is mostly contained in slow\nmodulation. Maximum mutual information occurs around 3-6 Hz which also happens\nto be the range of modulations most preferred by the ASR. In addition, we show\nthat incorporation of this knowledge into ASRs significantly reduces its\ndependency on the amount of training data.",

    "abstract": "Imaging genetic studies aim to find associations between genetic variants and\nimaging quantitative traits. Traditional genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\nare based on univariate statistical tests, but when multiple traits are\nanalyzed together they suffer from a multiple-testing problem and from not\ntaking into account correlations among the traits. An alternative approach to\nmulti-trait GWAS is to reverse the functional relation between genotypes and\ntraits, by fitting a multivariate regression model to predict genotypes from\nmultiple traits simultaneously. However, current reverse genotype prediction\napproaches are mostly based on linear models. Here, we evaluated random forest\nregression (RFR) as a method to predict SNPs from imaging QTs and identify\nbiologically relevant associations. We learned machine learning models to\npredict 518,484 SNPs using 56 brain imaging QTs. We observed that genotype\nregression error is a better indicator of permutation p-value significance than\ngenotype classification accuracy. SNPs within the known Alzheimer disease (AD)\nrisk gene APOE had lowest RMSE for lasso and random forest, but not ridge\nregression. Moreover, random forests identified additional SNPs that were not\nprioritized by the linear models but are known to be associated with\nbrain-related disorders. Feature selection identified well-known brain regions\nassociated with AD,like the hippocampus and amygdala, as important predictors\nof the most significant SNPs. In summary, our results indicate that non-linear\nmethods like random forests may offer additional insights into\nphenotype-genotype associations compared to traditional linear multi-variate\nGWAS methods.",

This disease has a high prevalence primarily in the\nelderly accompanying memory loss and cognitive decline. AD detection is a\nchallenging task which many authors have developed numerous computerized\nautomatic diagnosis systems utilizing neuroimaging and other clinical data. MRI\nscans provide high-intensity visible features, making these scans the most\nwidely used brain imaging technique. In recent years deep learning has achieved\nleading success in medical image analysis. But a relatively little\ninvestigation has been done to apply deep learning techniques for the brain MRI\nclassification. This paper explores the construction of several deep learning\narchitectures evaluated on brain MRI images and segmented images. The idea\nbehind segmented images investigates the influence of image segmentation step\non deep learning classification. The image processing presented a pipeline\nconsisting of pre-processing to enhance the MRI scans and post-processing\nconsisting of a segmentation method for segmenting the brain tissues. The\nresults show that the processed images achieved a better accuracy in the binary\nclassification of AD vs. CN (Cognitively Normal) across four different\narchitectures.

System independent rho-e and Z-e (SIRZ) refers to a suite\nof methods for estimating the system independent material properties of\nelectron density, rho-e, and effective atomic number, Z-e, of an object scanned\nusing dual-energy X-ray CT (DECT). The current state-of-the-art approach,\nSIRZ-2, makes certain approximations that lead to inaccurate estimates for\nlarge atomic numbered (Z-e) materials. In this paper, we present an extension,\nSIRZ-3, which iteratively reconstructs the unknown rho-e and Z-e while avoiding\nthe limiting approximations made by SIRZ-2. Unlike SIRZ-2, this allows SIRZ-3\nto accurately reconstruct rho-e and Z-e even at large values of Z-e. SIRZ-3\nrelies on the use of a new non-linear differentiable forward measurement model\nthat expresses the DECT measurement data as a direct analytical function of\nrho-e and Z-e. Leveraging this new forward model, we use an iterative\noptimization algorithm to reconstruct (or solve for) rho-e and Z-e directly\nfrom the DECT data.

While various\nadversarial robustness testing approaches were introduced in the last decade,\nwe note that most of them are incompatible with non-differentiable models such\nas tree ensembles. Since tree ensembles are widely used in industry, this\nreveals a crucial gap between adversarial robustness research and practical\napplications. This paper proposes a novel whitebox adversarial robustness\ntesting approach for tree ensemble models. Concretely, the proposed approach\nsmooths the tree ensembles through temperature controlled sigmoid functions,\nwhich enables gradient descent-based adversarial attacks. By leveraging\nsampling and the log-derivative trick, the proposed approach can scale up to\ntesting tasks that were previously unmanageable. We compare the approach\nagainst both random perturbations and blackbox approaches on multiple public\ndatasets (and corresponding models).

    "abstract": "Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) is a powerful tool for decision\nmaking under uncertainty. It is particularly appealing because of its ability\nto leverage existing data. However, many practical problems call for\ndecision-making with some auxiliary information, and DRO in the context of\nconditional distribution is not straightforward. We propose a conditional\nkernel distributionally robust optimization (CKDRO) method that enables robust\ndecision making under conditional distributions through kernel DRO and the\nconditional mean operator in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). In\nparticular, we consider problems where there is a correlation between the\nunknown variable y and an auxiliary observable variable x. Given past data of\nthe two variables and a queried auxiliary variable, CKDRO represents the\nconditional distribution P(y|x) as the conditional mean operator in the RKHS\nspace and quantifies the ambiguity set in the RKHS as well, which depends on\nthe size of the dataset as well as the query point. To justify the use of RKHS,\nwe demonstrate that the ambiguity set defined in RKHS can be viewed as a ball\nunder a metric that is similar to the Wasserstein metric. The DRO is then\ndualized and solved via a finite dimensional convex program. The proposed CKDRO\napproach is applied to a generation scheduling problem and shows that the\nresult of CKDRO is superior to common benchmarks in terms of quality and\nrobustness.",

    "abstract": "Existing light field representations, such as epipolar plane image (EPI) and\nsub-aperture images, do not consider the structural characteristics across the\nviews, so they usually require additional disparity and spatial structure cues\nfor follow-up tasks. Besides, they have difficulties dealing with occlusions or\nlarger disparity scenes. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Epipolar\nFocus Spectrum (EFS) representation by rearranging the EPI spectrum. Different\nfrom the classical EPI representation where an EPI line corresponds to a\nspecific depth, there is a one-to-one mapping from the EFS line to the view.\nAccordingly, compared to a sparsely-sampled light field, a densely-sampled one\nwith the same field of view (FoV) leads to a more compact distribution of such\nlinear structures in the double-cone-shaped region with the identical opening\nangle in its corresponding EFS. Hence the EFS representation is invariant to\nthe scene depth. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we develop a trainable\nEFS-based pipeline for light field reconstruction, where a dense light field\ncan be reconstructed by compensating the \"missing EFS lines\" given a sparse\nlight field, yielding promising results with cross-view consistency, especially\nin the presence of severe occlusion and large disparity. Experimental results\non both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the validity and\nsuperiority of the proposed method over SOTA methods.",

Compared to existing CBF\ntechniques, this strategy is proactive rather than reactive and thus\npotentially results in smaller modifications to the nominal trajectory. The\nproposed strategy is shown to be provably safe, and then is demonstrated in\nsimulated scenarios where it would otherwise be difficult to construct a\ntraditional CBF. In simulation, the predictive CBF results in less modification\nto the nominal trajectory and smaller control inputs than a traditional CBF,\nand faster computations than a nonlinear model predictive control approach.",

It\nuses the fast and stable iterative source steering algorithm together with a\nneural source model. The parameters from the ASR module and the neural source\nmodel are optimized jointly from the ASR loss itself. We demonstrate\ncompetitive performance with previous systems using neural beamforming\nfrontends. First, we explore the trade-offs when using various number of\nchannels for training and testing.

    "abstract": "Defocus deblurring is a challenging task due to the spatially varying nature\nof defocus blur. While deep learning approach shows great promise in solving\nimage restoration problems, defocus deblurring demands accurate training data\nthat consists of all-in-focus and defocus image pairs, which is difficult to\ncollect. Naive two-shot capturing cannot achieve pixel-wise correspondence\nbetween the defocused and all-in-focus image pairs. Synthetic aperture of light\nfields is suggested to be a more reliable way to generate accurate image pairs.\nHowever, the defocus blur generated from light field data is different from\nthat of the images captured with a traditional digital camera. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel deep defocus deblurring network that leverages the strength\nand overcomes the shortcoming of light fields. We first train the network on a\nlight field-generated dataset for its highly accurate image correspondence.\nThen, we fine-tune the network using feature loss on another dataset collected\nby the two-shot method to alleviate the differences between the defocus blur\nexists in the two domains. This strategy is proved to be highly effective and\nable to achieve the state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and\nqualitatively on multiple test sets.

    "abstract": "Electromagnetic metasurfaces have attracted significant interest recently due\nto their low profile and advantageous applications. Practically, many\nmetasurface designs start with a set of constraints for the radiated far-field,\nsuch as main-beam direction(s) and side lobe levels, and end with a non-uniform\nphysical structure for the surface. This problem is quite challenging, since\nthe required tangential field transformations are not completely known when\nonly constraints are placed on the scattered fields. Hence, the required\nsurface properties cannot be solved for analytically. Moreover, the translation\nof the desired surface properties to the physical unit cells can be\ntime-consuming and difficult, as it is often a one-to-many mapping in a large\nsolution space. Here, we divide the inverse design process into two steps: a\nmacroscopic and microscopic design step. In the former, we use an iterative\noptimization process to find the surface properties that radiate a far-field\npattern that complies with specified constraints. This iterative process\nexploits non-radiating currents to ensure a passive and lossless design. In the\nmicroscopic step, these optimized surface properties are realized with physical\nunit cells using machine learning surrogate models. The effectiveness of this\nend-to-end synthesis process is demonstrated through measurement results of a\nbeam-splitting prototype.",

Considering seen and unseen\nspeakers have diverse characteristics, zero-shot adaptive TTS requires strong\ngeneralization ability on speaker characteristics, which brings modeling\nchallenges. In this paper, we develop AdaSpeech 4, a zero-shot adaptive TTS\nsystem for high-quality speech synthesis.

Generally, the\nmodeling of speaker characteristics can be categorized into three steps:\nextracting speaker representation, taking this speaker representation as\ncondition, and synthesizing speech/mel-spectrogram given this speaker\nrepresentation. Accordingly, we improve the modeling in three steps: 1) To\nextract speaker representation with better generalization, we factorize the\nspeaker characteristics into basis vectors and extract speaker representation\nby weighted combining of these basis vectors through attention. 2) We leverage\nconditional layer normalization to integrate the extracted speaker\nrepresentation to TTS model. 3) We propose a novel supervision loss based on\nthe distribution of basis vectors to maintain the corresponding speaker\ncharacteristics in generated mel-spectrograms.

To obtain low-dimensional embeddings, principal component\nanalysis is performed, and the study analyzes that only a few principal\ncomponents are significant. However, the appropriate number of significant\ncomponents are not known. To address this, an automatic dictionary learning\nframework is utilized that approximates the underlying subspace. Further, the\nlow-dimensional embeddings are aggregated in a late-fusion manner in the\nensemble framework to incorporate hierarchical information learned at various\nintermediate layers. The experimental evaluation is performed on publicly\navailable DCASE 2017 and 2018 ASC datasets on a pre-trained 1-D CNN, SoundNet.\nEmpirically, it is observed that deeper layers show more compression ratio than\nothers. At 70% compression ratio across different datasets, the performance is\nsimilar to that obtained without performing any dimensionality reduction.
