    "title": "Learning to Walk Autonomously via Reset-Free Quality-Diversity",
    "abstract": "Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms can discover large and complex behavioural\nrepertoires consisting of both diverse and high-performing skills. However, the\ngeneration of behavioural repertoires has mainly been limited to simulation\nenvironments instead of real-world learning. This is because existing QD\nalgorithms need large numbers of evaluations as well as episodic resets, which\nrequire manual human supervision and interventions. This paper proposes\nReset-Free Quality-Diversity optimization (RF-QD) as a step towards autonomous\nlearning for robotics in open-ended environments. We build on Dynamics-Aware\nQuality-Diversity (DA-QD) and introduce a behaviour selection policy that\nleverages the diversity of the imagined repertoire and environmental\ninformation to intelligently select of behaviours that can act as automatic\nresets. We demonstrate this through a task of learning to walk within defined\ntraining zones with obstacles. Our experiments show that we can learn full\nrepertoires of legged locomotion controllers autonomously without manual resets\nwith high sample efficiency in spite of harsh safety constraints. Finally,\nusing an ablation of different target objectives, we show that it is important\nfor RF-QD to have diverse types solutions available for the behaviour selection\npolicy over solutions optimised with a specific objective.

The high-order\nspatial reconstruction is achieved using the recently developed weighted\nessentially non-oscillatory schemes with adaptive order (WENO-AO); and the\nhigh-order temporal accuracy is achieved by explicit RK methods for convection\nequations and implicit-explicit (IMEX) RK methods for convection-diffusion\nequations.

    "abstract": "Revision is an essential part of the human writing process. It tends to be\nstrategic, adaptive, and, more importantly, iterative in nature. Despite the\nsuccess of large language models on text revision tasks, they are limited to\nnon-iterative, one-shot revisions. Examining and evaluating the capability of\nlarge language models for making continuous revisions and collaborating with\nhuman writers is a critical step towards building effective writing assistants.\nIn this work, we present a human-in-the-loop iterative text revision system,\nRead, Revise, Repeat (R3), which aims at achieving high quality text revisions\nwith minimal human efforts by reading model-generated revisions and user\nfeedbacks, revising documents, and repeating human-machine interactions. In R3,\na text revision model provides text editing suggestions for human writers, who\ncan accept or reject the suggested edits. The accepted edits are then\nincorporated into the model for the next iteration of document revision.\nWriters can therefore revise documents iteratively by interacting with the\nsystem and simply accepting/rejecting its suggested edits until the text\nrevision model stops making further revisions or reaches a predefined maximum\nnumber of revisions. Empirical experiments show that R3 can generate revisions\nwith comparable acceptance rate to human writers at early revision depths, and\nthe human-machine interaction can get higher quality revisions with fewer\niterations and edits.

First, we perform mode\nselection for the D2D link, in which the D2D pair can either communicate\ndirectly by relaying data from RISs or through a base station (BS). Next, we\nprovide closed-form expressions for the effective capacity (EC) of the\nRIS-assisted D2D link. When channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT)\nis available, the transmit D2D node communicates with the variable rate\n$r_t(n)$ (adjustable according to the channel conditions); otherwise, it uses a\nfixed rate $r_t$. It allows us to model the RIS-assisted D2D link as a Markov\nsystem in both cases. We also extend our analysis to overlay and underlay D2D\nsettings. To improve the throughput of the RIS-assisted D2D link when CSIT is\nunknown, we use the HARQ retransmission scheme and provide the EC analysis of\nthe HARQ-enabled RIS-assisted D2D link. Finally, simulation results demonstrate\nthat: i) the EC increases with an increase in RIS elements, ii) the EC\ndecreases when strict QoS constraints are imposed at the transmit node, iii)\nthe EC decreases with an increase in the variance of the path loss estimation\nerror, iv) the EC increases with an increase in the probability of ON states,\nv) EC increases by using HARQ when CSIT is unknown, and it can reach up to\n$5\\times$ the usual EC (with no HARQ and without CSIT) by using the optimal\nnumber of retransmissions.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel model training solution, denoted as\nAdaptive-Gravity, for enhancing the robustness of deep neural network\nclassifiers against adversarial examples. We conceptualize the model\nparameters/features associated with each class as a mass characterized by its\ncentroid location and the spread (standard deviation of the distance) of\nfeatures around the centroid. We use the centroid associated with each cluster\nto derive an anti-gravity force that pushes the centroids of different classes\naway from one another during network training. Then we customized an objective\nfunction that aims to concentrate each class's features toward their\ncorresponding new centroid, which has been obtained by anti-gravity force. This\nmethodology results in a larger separation between different masses and reduces\nthe spread of features around each centroid. As a result, the samples are\npushed away from the space that adversarial examples could be mapped to,\neffectively increasing the degree of perturbation needed for making an\nadversarial example. We have implemented this training solution as an iterative\nmethod consisting of four steps at each iteration: 1) centroid extraction, 2)\nanti-gravity force calculation, 3) centroid relocation, and 4) gravity\ntraining. Gravity's efficiency is evaluated by measuring the corresponding\nfooling rates against various attack models, including FGSM, MIM, BIM, and PGD\nusing LeNet and ResNet110 networks, benchmarked against MNIST and CIFAR10\nclassification problems.

Although the primary goal of traditional\nrecommendation systems is to deliver the most relevant items, such an effort\nunintentionally can cause collateral effects including low diversity and\nunbalanced genres or categories, benefiting particular groups of categories.\nThis paper proposes an approach to create recommendation lists with a\ncalibrated balance of genres, avoiding disproportion between the user's profile\ninterests and the recommendation list. The calibrated recommendations consider\nconcomitantly the relevance and the divergence between the genres distributions\nextracted from the user's preference and the recommendation list. The main\nclaim is that calibration can contribute positively to generate fairer\nrecommendations. In particular, we propose a new trade-off equation, which\nconsiders the users' bias to provide a recommendation list that seeks for the\nusers' tendencies. Moreover, we propose a conceptual framework and a decision\nprotocol to generate more than one thousand combinations of calibrated systems\nin order to find the best combination. We compare our approach against\nstate-of-the-art approaches using multiple domain datasets, which are analyzed\nby rank and calibration metrics. The results indicate that the trade-off, which\nconsiders the users' bias, produces positive effects on the precision and to\nthe fairness, thus generating recommendation lists that respect the genre\ndistribution and, through the decision protocol, we also found the best system\nfor each dataset.",

This work presents a taxonomy of\nalgorithms for imbalanced data streams and proposes a standardized, exhaustive,\nand informative experimental testbed to evaluate algorithms in a collection of\ndiverse and challenging imbalanced data stream scenarios. The experimental\nstudy evaluates 24 state-of-the-art data streams algorithms on 515 imbalanced\ndata streams that combine static and dynamic class imbalance ratios,\ninstance-level difficulties, concept drift, real-world and semi-synthetic\ndatasets in binary and multi-class scenarios.

    "title": "Automated Design of Salient Object Detection Algorithms with Brain  Programming",
    "abstract": "Despite recent improvements in computer vision, artificial visual systems'\ndesign is still daunting since an explanation of visual computing algorithms\nremains elusive. Salient object detection is one problem that is still open due\nto the difficulty of understanding the brain's inner workings. Progress on this\nresearch area follows the traditional path of hand-made designs using\nneuroscience knowledge. In recent years two different approaches based on\ngenetic programming appear to enhance their technique. One follows the idea of\ncombining previous hand-made methods through genetic programming and fuzzy\nlogic. The other approach consists of improving the inner computational\nstructures of basic hand-made models through artificial evolution. This\nresearch work proposes expanding the artificial dorsal stream using a recent\nproposal to solve salient object detection problems. This approach uses the\nbenefits of the two main aspects of this research area: fixation prediction and\ndetection of salient objects. We decided to apply the fusion of visual saliency\nand image segmentation algorithms as a template. The proposed methodology\ndiscovers several critical structures in the template through artificial\nevolution. We present results on a benchmark designed by experts with\noutstanding results in comparison with the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a nonlinear location estimation to infer the position of\na user holding a smartphone. We consider a large location with $M$ number of\ngrid points, each grid point is labeled with a unique fingerprint consisting of\nthe received signal strength (RSS) values measured from $N$ number of Bluetooth\nLow Energy (BLE) beacons. Given the fingerprint observed by the smartphone, the\nuser's current location can be estimated by finding the top-k similar\nfingerprints from the list of fingerprints registered in the database. Besides\nthe environmental factors, the dynamicity in holding the smartphone is another\nsource to the variation in fingerprint measurements, yet there are not many\nstudies addressing the fingerprint variability due to dynamic smartphone\npositions held by human hands during online detection. To this end, we propose\na nonlinear location estimation using the kernel method. Specifically, our\nproposed method comprises of two steps: 1) a beacon selection strategy to\nselect a subset of beacons that is insensitive to the subtle change of holding\npositions, and 2) a kernel method to compute the similarity between this subset\nof observed signals and all the fingerprints registered in the database. The\nexperimental results based on large-scale data collected in a complex building\nindicate a substantial performance gain of our proposed approach in comparison\nto state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Deep learning and big data algorithms have become widely used in industrial\napplications to optimize several tasks in many complex systems. Particularly,\ndeep learning model for diagnosing and prognosing machinery health has\nleveraged predictive maintenance (PdM) to be more accurate and reliable in\ndecision making, in this way avoiding unnecessary interventions, machinery\naccidents, and environment catastrophes. Recently, Transformer Neural Networks\nhave gained notoriety and have been increasingly the favorite choice for\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Thus, given their recent major\nachievements in NLP, this paper proposes the development of an automatic fault\nclassifier model for predictive maintenance based on a modified version of the\nTransformer architecture, namely T4PdM, to identify multiple types of faults in\nrotating machinery. Experimental results are developed and presented for the\nMaFaulDa and CWRU databases. T4PdM was able to achieve an overall accuracy of\n99.98% and 98% for both datasets, respectively. In addition, the performance of\nthe proposed model is compared to other previously published works. It has\ndemonstrated the superiority of the model in detecting and classifying faults\nin rotating industrial machinery. Therefore, the proposed Transformer-based\nmodel can improve the performance of machinery fault analysis and diagnostic\nprocesses and leverage companies to a new era of the Industry 4.0.

    "abstract": "A recent emphasis of distributed learning research has been on federated\nlearning (FL), in which model training is conducted by the data-collecting\ndevices. Existing research on FL has mostly focused on a star topology learning\narchitecture with synchronized (time-triggered) model training rounds, where\nthe local models of the devices are periodically aggregated by a centralized\ncoordinating node. However, in many settings, such a coordinating node may not\nexist, motivating efforts to fully decentralize FL. In this work, we propose a\nnovel methodology for distributed model aggregations via asynchronous,\nevent-triggered consensus iterations over the network graph topology. We\nconsider heterogeneous communication event thresholds at each device that weigh\nthe change in local model parameters against the available local resources in\ndeciding the benefit of aggregations at each iteration. Through theoretical\nanalysis, we demonstrate that our methodology achieves asymptotic convergence\nto the globally optimal learning model under standard assumptions in\ndistributed learning and graph consensus literature, and without restrictive\nconnectivity requirements on the underlying topology. Subsequent numerical\nresults demonstrate that our methodology obtains substantial improvements in\ncommunication requirements compared with FL baselines.",

It is based on large vectors of binary or bipolar\nsymbols and a few simple mathematical operations. The promise of HDC is a\nhighly efficient implementation for embedded systems like wearables. While fast\nimplementations have been presented, other constraints have not been considered\nfor edge computing. In this work, we aim at answering how thermal-friendly HDC\nfor edge computing is. Devices like smartwatches, smart glasses, or even mobile\nsystems have a restrictive cooling budget due to their limited volume. Although\nHDC operations are simple, the vectors are large, resulting in a high number of\nCPU operations and thus a heavy load on the entire system potentially causing\ntemperature violations. In this work, the impact of HDC on the chip's\ntemperature is investigated for the first time. We measure the temperature and\npower consumption of a commercial embedded system and compare HDC with\nconventional CNN. We reveal that HDC causes up to 6.8{\\deg}C higher\ntemperatures and leads to up to 47% more CPU throttling.

    "abstract": "When writing programs, people have the ability to tackle a new complex task\nby decomposing it into smaller and more familiar subtasks. While it is\ndifficult to measure whether neural program synthesis methods have similar\ncapabilities, what we can measure is whether they compositionally generalize,\nthat is, whether a model that has been trained on the simpler subtasks is\nsubsequently able to solve more complex tasks. In this paper, we focus on\nmeasuring the ability of learned program synthesizers to compositionally\ngeneralize. We first characterize several different axes along which program\nsynthesis methods would be desired to generalize, e.g., length generalization,\nor the ability to combine known subroutines in new ways that do not occur in\nthe training data. Based on this characterization, we introduce a benchmark\nsuite of tasks to assess these abilities based on two popular existing\ndatasets, SCAN and RobustFill. Finally, we make first attempts to improve the\ncompositional generalization ability of Transformer models along these axes\nthrough novel attention mechanisms that draw inspiration from a human-like\ndecomposition strategy. Empirically, we find our modified Transformer models\ngenerally perform better than natural baselines, but the tasks remain\nchallenging.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Global (inter-patient) ECG classification for arrhythmia detection\nover Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is a challenging task for both humans and\nmachines. The main reason is the significant variations of both normal and\narrhythmic ECG patterns among patients. Automating this process with utmost\naccuracy is, therefore, highly desirable due to the advent of wearable ECG\nsensors. However, even with numerous deep learning approaches proposed\nrecently, there is still a notable gap in the performance of global and\npatient-specific ECG classification performances. This study proposes a novel\napproach to narrow this gap and propose a real-time solution with shallow and\ncompact 1D Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs). Methods: In\nthis study, we propose a novel approach for inter-patient ECG classification\nusing a compact 1D Self-ONN by exploiting morphological and timing information\nin heart cycles. We used 1D Self-ONN layers to automatically learn\nmorphological representations from ECG data, enabling us to capture the shape\nof the ECG waveform around the R peaks. We further inject temporal features\nbased on RR interval for timing characterization. The classification layers can\nthus benefit from both temporal and learned features for the final arrhythmia\nclassification. Results: Using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia benchmark database, the\nproposed method achieves the highest classification performance ever achieved,\ni.e., 99.21% precision, 99.10% recall, and 99.15% F1-score for normal (N)\nsegments; 82.19% precision, 82.50% recall, and 82.34% F1-score for the\nsupra-ventricular ectopic beat (SVEBs); and finally, 94.41% precision, 96.10%\nrecall, and 95.2% F1-score for the ventricular-ectopic beats (VEBs).",

To better\nunderstand user behaviors in OSS user forums, we carried out an empirical study\nanalyzing about 1.3 million posts from user forums of four popular OSS\napplications: Zotero, Audacity, VLC, and RStudio. Through analyzing the\ncontribution patterns of three common user types (end-users, developers, and\norganizers), we observed that end-users not only initiated most of the threads\n(above 96% of threads in three projects, 86% in the other), but also acted as\nthe significant contributors for responding to other users' posts, even though\nthey tended to lack confidence in their activities as indicated by\npsycho-linguistic analyses.

    "abstract": "The massive growth of network traffic data leads to a large volume of\ndatasets. Labeling these datasets for identifying intrusion attacks is very\nlaborious and error-prone. Furthermore, network traffic data have complex\ntime-varying non-linear relationships. The existing state-of-the-art intrusion\ndetection solutions use a combination of various supervised approaches along\nwith fused features subsets based on correlations in traffic data. These\nsolutions often require high computational cost, manual support in fine-tuning\nintrusion detection models, and labeling of data that limit real-time\nprocessing of network traffic. Unsupervised solutions do reduce computational\ncomplexities and manual support for labeling data but current unsupervised\nsolutions do not consider spatio-temporal correlations in traffic data. To\naddress this, we propose a unified Autoencoder based on combining multi-scale\nconvolutional neural network and long short-term memory (MSCNN-LSTM-AE) for\nanomaly detection in network traffic. The model first employs Multiscale\nConvolutional Neural Network Autoencoder (MSCNN-AE) to analyze the spatial\nfeatures of the dataset, and then latent space features learned from MSCNN-AE\nemploys Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Autoencoder Network to process the\ntemporal features. Our model further employs two Isolation Forest algorithms as\nerror correction mechanisms to detect false positives and false negatives to\nimprove detection accuracy. %Additionally, covariance matrices forms a\nRiemannian manifold that is naturally embedded with distance metrices that\nfacilitates descriminative patterns for detecting malicious network traffic.

In applications one often needs to quickly\ntell if an input matrix is PSD, and a small distance from the PSD cone may be\ntolerable. We consider two well-studied query models for measuring efficiency,\nnamely, the matrix-vector and vector-matrix-vector query models. We first\nconsider one-sided testers, which are testers that correctly classify any PSD\ninput, but may fail on a non-PSD input with a tiny failure probability. Up to\nlogarithmic factors, in the matrix-vector query model we show a tight\n$\\widetilde{\\Theta}(1/\\epsilon^{p/(2p+1)})$ bound, while in the\nvector-matrix-vector query model we show a tight\n$\\widetilde{\\Theta}(d^{1-1/p}/\\epsilon)$ bound, for every $p \\geq 1$. We also\nshow a strong separation between one-sided and two-sided testers in the\nvector-matrix-vector model, where a two-sided tester can fail on both PSD and\nnon-PSD inputs with a tiny failure probability. In particular, for the\nimportant case of the Frobenius norm, we show that any one-sided tester\nrequires $\\widetilde{\\Omega}(\\sqrt{d}/\\epsilon)$ queries.

    "abstract": "The rapid development of new software and algorithms, fueled by the immense\namount of data available, has made the shelf life of software products a lot\nshorter. With a rough estimate of more than 40,000 new software projects\ndeveloped every day, it is becoming quicker and cheaper to abandon old software\nand acquire new software that meets rapidly changing needs and demands. What\nhappens to software that is abandoned and what consequences may arise from\n'throwaway' culture (Cooper, 2005) are still open questions. This paper will\nexplore the systems engineering concept of end-of-life for software, it will\nhighlight the gaps in existing software engineering practices, it will bring\nforward examples of software that has been abandoned in an attempt to\ndecommission and it will explore the repercussions of abandoned software\nartefacts. A proposed way forward for addressing the identified research gaps\nis also detailed.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we consider the problem of designing a safety filter for a\nnonlinear uncertain control system. Our goal is to augment an arbitrary\ncontroller with a safety filter such that the overall closed-loop system is\nguaranteed to stay within a given state constraint set, referred to as being\nsafe. For systems with known dynamics, control barrier functions (CBFs) provide\na scalar condition for determining if a system is safe. For uncertain systems,\nrobust or adaptive CBF certification approaches have been proposed. However,\nthese approaches can be conservative or require the system to have a particular\nparametric structure. For more generic uncertain systems, machine learning\napproaches have been used to approximate the CBF condition. These works\ntypically assume that the learning module is sufficiently trained prior to\ndeployment. Safety during learning is not guaranteed. We propose a barrier\nBayesian linear regression (BBLR) approach that guarantees safe online learning\nof the CBF condition for the true, uncertain system. We assume that the error\nbetween the nominal system and the true system is bounded and exploit the\nstructure of the CBF condition. We show that our approach can safely expand the\nset of certifiable control inputs despite system and learning uncertainties.\nThe effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in simulation using a\ntwo-dimensional pendulum stabilization task.",

Firstly, the global optimum solution is\nobtained in the ideal scenario when there are available satellites at all the\nideal locations. Next, we propose a nearest neighbor search algorithm for\nrealistic (non-ideal) scenarios with a limited number of satellites. The\nproposed algorithm can approach the global optimum solution under an ideal\nscenario through a finite number of iterations and a tiny range of searches.\nCompared with other routing strategies, the proposed algorithm shows\nsignificant advantages in terms of latency. Furthermore, we provide two\napproximation techniques that can give tight lower and upper bounds for the\nlatency of the proposed algorithm, respectively.

    "abstract": "The support set is a key to providing conditional prior for fast adaption of\nthe model in few-shot tasks. But the strict form of support set makes its\nconstruction actually difficult in practical application. Motivated by ANIL, we\nrethink the role of adaption in the feature extractor of CNAPs, which is a\nstate-of-the-art representative few-shot method. To investigate the role,\nAlmost Zero-Shot (AZS) task is designed by fixing the support set to replace\nthe common scheme, which provides corresponding support sets for the different\nconditional prior of different tasks. The AZS experiment results infer that the\nadaptation works little in the feature extractor. However, CNAPs cannot be\nrobust to randomly selected support sets and perform poorly on some datasets of\nMeta-Dataset because of its scattered mean embeddings responded by the simple\nmean operator. To enhance the robustness of CNAPs, Canonical Mean Filter (CMF)\nmodule is proposed to make the mean embeddings intensive and stable in feature\nspace by mapping the support sets into a canonical form. CMFs make CNAPs robust\nto any fixed support sets even if they are random matrices. This attribution\nmakes CNAPs be able to remove the mean encoder and the parameter adaptation\nnetwork at the test stage, while CNAP-CMF on AZS tasks keeps the performance\nwith one-shot tasks. It leads to a big parameter reduction. Precisely, 40.48\\%\nparameters are dropped at the test stage. Also, CNAP-CMF outperforms CNAPs in\none-shot tasks because it addresses inner-task unstable performance problems.\nClassification performance, visualized and clustering results verify that CMFs\nmake CNAPs better and simpler.",

Specifically, within a\nbranch-and-bound framework, we investigate parameterized node selection rules\nthat explicitly consider diversity. Our results indicate that our approach\nsignificantly increases diversity of the final solution set. When compared with\nexisting methods for finding diverse near-optimal sets, our method runs with\nsimilar run-time as regular node selection methods and gives a diversity\nimprovement of up to 140%. In contrast, popular node selection rules such as\nbest-first search gives an improvement of no more than 40%.

    "abstract": "Recently, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has become a novel state-of-art\nfor Collaborative Filtering (CF) based Recommender Systems (RS). It is a common\npractice to learn informative user and item representations by performing\nembedding propagation on a user-item bipartite graph, and then provide the\nusers with personalized item suggestions based on the representations. Despite\neffectiveness, existing algorithms neglect precious interactive features\nbetween user-item pairs in the embedding process. When predicting a user's\npreference for different items, they still aggregate the user tree in the same\nway, without emphasizing target-related information in the user neighborhood.\nSuch a uniform aggregation scheme easily leads to suboptimal user and item\nrepresentations, limiting the model expressiveness to some extent.\nIn this work, we address this problem by building bilateral interactive\nguidance between each user-item pair and proposing a new model named IA-GCN\n(short for InterActive GCN). Specifically, when learning the user\nrepresentation from its neighborhood, we assign higher attention weights to\nthose neighbors similar to the target item. Correspondingly, when learning the\nitem representation, we pay more attention to those neighbors resembling the\ntarget user. This leads to interactive and interpretable features, effectively\ndistilling target-specific information through each graph convolutional\noperation. Our model is built on top of LightGCN, a state-of-the-art GCN model\nfor CF, and can be combined with various GCN-based CF architectures in an\nend-to-end fashion.

Therefore, this paper uses quality of experience\n(QoE) as the optimization criterion of the PHY algorithm.

    "abstract": "The field of bibliometrics, studying citations and behavior, is critical to\nthe discussion of reproducibility. Citations are one of the primary incentive\nand reward systems for academic work, and so we desire to know if this\nincentive rewards reproducible work. Yet to the best of our knowledge, only one\nwork has attempted to look at this combined space, concluding that\nnon-reproducible work is more highly cited. We show that answering this\nquestion is more challenging than first proposed, and subtle issues can inhibit\na robust conclusion. To make inferences with more robust behavior, we propose a\nhierarchical Bayesian model that incorporates the citation rate over time,\nrather than the total number of citations after a fixed amount of time. In\ndoing so we show that, under current evidence the answer is more likely that\ncertain fields of study such as Medicine and Machine Learning (ML) do correlate\nreproducible works with more citations, but other fields appear to have no\nrelationship. Further, we find that making code available and thoroughly\nreferencing prior works appear to also positively correlate with increased\ncitations.

Existing adversarial UDA methods typically adopt an\nadditional discriminator to play the min-max game with a feature extractor.\nHowever, most of these methods failed to effectively leverage the predicted\ndiscriminative information, and thus cause mode collapse for generator. In this\nwork, we address this problem from a different perspective and design a simple\nyet effective adversarial paradigm in the form of a discriminator-free\nadversarial learning network (DALN), wherein the category classifier is reused\nas a discriminator, which achieves explicit domain alignment and category\ndistinguishment through a unified objective, enabling the DALN to leverage the\npredicted discriminative information for sufficient feature alignment.\nBasically, we introduce a Nuclear-norm Wasserstein discrepancy (NWD) that has\ndefinite guidance meaning for performing discrimination.

In this paper, we propose\nan efficient and privacy-preserving global model training protocol in the\ncontext of FL in large-scale peer-to-peer networks, CFL. The proposed CFL\nprotocol aggregates local contributions hierarchically by a cluster-based\naggregation mode, as well as a leverged authenticated encryption scheme to\nensure the security communication, whose key is distributed by a modified\nsecure communication key establishment protocol. Theoretical analyses show that\nCFL guarantees the privacy of local model update parameters, as well as\nintegrity and authenticity under the widespread internal semi-honest and\nexternal malicious threat models. In particular, the proposed key revocation\nbased on public voting can effectively defense against external adversaries\nhijacking honest participants to ensure the confidentiality of the\ncommunication keys. Moreover, the modified secure communication key\nestablishment protocol indeed achieves high network connectivity probability to\nensure transmission security of the system.",

    "abstract": "Partial label learning (PLL) is a typical weakly supervised learning problem,\nwhere each training example is associated with a set of candidate labels among\nwhich only one is true. Most existing PLL approaches assume that the incorrect\nlabels in each training example are randomly picked as the candidate labels and\nmodel the generation process of the candidate labels in a simple way. However,\nthese approaches usually do not perform as well as expected due to the fact\nthat the generation process of the candidate labels is always\ninstance-dependent. Therefore, it deserves to be modeled in a refined way. In\nthis paper, we consider instance-dependent PLL and assume that the generation\nprocess of the candidate labels could decompose into two sequential parts,\nwhere the correct label emerges first in the mind of the annotator but then the\nincorrect labels related to the feature are also selected with the correct\nlabel as candidate labels due to uncertainty of labeling. Motivated by this\nconsideration, we propose a novel PLL method that performs Maximum A\nPosterior(MAP) based on an explicitly modeled generation process of candidate\nlabels via decomposed probability distribution models.

To tackle the problem, we\npropose a simple yet effective approach based on a cycle consistency loss.\nSpecifically, we train eAEs of multiple speakers with a shared encoder, and\nmeanwhile encourage the speech reconstructed from any speaker-specific decoder\nto get a consistent latent code as the original speech when cycled back and\nencoded again.

Service\nproviders typically monitor SLAs for management tasks such as improving their\nservice quality, customer billing and future network planning. Network service\ncustomers, on their side, monitor SLAs to optimize network usage and apply,\nwhen required, penalties related to service failures. In future 6G networks,\ncritical network applications such as remote surgery and connected vehicles\nwill require these SLAs to be more dynamic, flexible, and automated to match\ntheir diverse requirements on network services. Moreover, these SLAs should be\ntransparent to all stakeholders to address the trustworthiness on network\nservices and service providers required by critical applications.

    "abstract": "Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) is a challenging research task\ndue to the lack of accurate annotation on the temporal sequence of sign\nlanguage data. The recent popular usage is a hybrid model based on \"CNN + RNN\"\nfor CSLR. However, when extracting temporal features in these works, most of\nthe methods using a fixed temporal receptive field and cannot extract the\ntemporal features well for each sign language word. In order to obtain more\naccurate temporal features, this paper proposes a multi-scale temporal network\n(MSTNet). The network mainly consists of three parts. The Resnet and two fully\nconnected (FC) layers constitute the frame-wise feature extraction part. The\ntime-wise feature extraction part performs temporal feature learning by first\nextracting temporal receptive field features of different scales using the\nproposed multi-scale temporal block (MST-block) to improve the temporal\nmodeling capability, and then further encoding the temporal features of\ndifferent scales by the transformers module to obtain more accurate temporal\nfeatures. Finally, the proposed multi-level Connectionist Temporal\nClassification (CTC) loss part is used for training to obtain recognition\nresults. The multi-level CTC loss enables better learning and updating of the\nshallow network parameters in CNN, and the method has no parameter increase and\ncan be flexibly embedded in other models. Experimental results on two publicly\navailable datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively extract sign\nlanguage features in an end-to-end manner without any prior knowledge,\nimproving the accuracy of CSLR and reaching the state-of-the-art.",

    "title": "CD$^2$-pFed: Cyclic Distillation-guided Channel Decoupling for Model  Personalization in Federated Learning",
    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that enables\nmultiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared global model. Despite the\nrecent progress, it remains challenging to deal with heterogeneous data\nclients, as the discrepant data distributions usually prevent the global model\nfrom delivering good generalization ability on each participating client. In\nthis paper, we propose CD^2-pFed, a novel Cyclic Distillation-guided Channel\nDecoupling framework, to personalize the global model in FL, under various\nsettings of data heterogeneity. Different from previous works which establish\nlayer-wise personalization to overcome the non-IID data across different\nclients, we make the first attempt at channel-wise assignment for model\npersonalization, referred to as channel decoupling. To further facilitate the\ncollaboration between private and shared weights, we propose a novel cyclic\ndistillation scheme to impose a consistent regularization between the local and\nglobal model representations during the federation. Guided by the cyclical\ndistillation, our channel decoupling framework can deliver more accurate and\ngeneralized results for different kinds of heterogeneity, such as feature skew,\nlabel distribution skew, and concept shift. Comprehensive experiments on four\nbenchmarks, including natural image and medical image analysis tasks,\ndemonstrate the consistent effectiveness of our method on both local and\nexternal validations.",

This logic\nextends classical first-order logic by modulo-counting, threshold-counting, and\nexact-counting quantifiers, all applied to tuples of variables. Further, the\nresidue in modulo-counting quantifiers is given as a term. Our main result\nshows that satisfaction for this logic is decidable in two-fold exponential\nspace. If only threshold- and exact-counting quantifiers are allowed, we prove\nan upper bound of alternating two-fold exponential time with linearly many\nalternations. This latter result almost matches Berman's exact complexity of\nfirst-order logic without counting quantifiers.\nTo obtain these results, we first translate threshold- and exact-counting\nquantifiers into classical first-order logic in polynomial time (which already\nproves the second result). To handle the remaining modulo-counting quantifiers\nfor tuples, we first reduce them in doubly exponential time to modulo-counting\nquantifiers for single elements. For these quantifiers, we provide a quantifier\nelimination procedure similar to Reddy and Loveland's procedure for first-order\nlogic and analyse the growth of coefficients, constants, and moduli appearing\nin this process. The bounds obtained this way allow to replace quantification\nin the original formula to integers of bounded size which then implies the\nfirst result mentioned above.\nOur logic is incomparable with the logic considered recently by Chistikov et\nal. They allow more general counting operations in quantifiers, but only unary\nquantifiers.

However, quantifying their safety and\nrobustness properties has proven challenging due to the non-linearities of the\nactivation functions inside the neural network. A key robustness indicator is\ncertifying the stability properties of the feedback system and providing a\nregion of attraction, which has been addressed in previous literature. However,\nthese works only address linear systems or require one to abstract the plant\nnon-linearities and bound them using slope and sector constraints. In this\npaper we use a Sum of Squares programming framework to compute the stability of\nnon-linear systems with neural network controllers directly. Within this\nframework, we can propose higher order candidate Lyapunov functions with richer\nstructures that are able to better capture the dynamics of the non-linear\nsystem and the nonlinearities in the neural network. We are also able to\nanalyse these systems in continuous time, whereas other methods rely on\ndiscretising the system. These higher order Lyapunov functions are used in\nconjunction with higher order multipliers on the inequality and equality\nconstraints that bound the neural network input-output properties. The volume\nof the region of attraction computed is increased compared to other methods,\nallowing for better safety guarantees on the stability of the system.

Within\nthis setup, a centralized, trusted shuffler is responsible for shuffling by\nkeeping the identities of data anonymous, which subsequently leads to stronger\nprivacy guarantees for systems. However, introducing a centralized entity to\nthe originally local privacy model loses some appeals of not having any\ncentralized entity as in local differential privacy. Moreover, implementing a\nshuffler in a reliable way is not trivial due to known security issues and/or\nrequirements of advanced hardware or secure computation technology.\nMotivated by these practical considerations, we rethink the shuffle model to\nrelax the assumption of requiring a centralized, trusted shuffler. We introduce\nnetwork shuffling, a decentralized mechanism where users exchange data in a\nrandom-walk fashion on a network/graph, as an alternative of achieving privacy\namplification via anonymity. We analyze the threat model under such a setting,\nand propose distributed protocols of network shuffling that is straightforward\nto implement in practice. Furthermore, we show that the privacy amplification\nrate is similar to other privacy amplification techniques such as uniform\nshuffling.

Conventionally,\nthese two topics have been studied separately using independent imaging setups\nand there is no existing method which can acquire depth and spectral\nreflectance simultaneously in one shot without using special hardware. In this\npaper, we propose a novel single-shot hyperspectral-depth reconstruction method\nusing an off-the-shelf RGB camera and projector. Our method is based on a\nsingle color-dot projection, which simultaneously acts as structured light for\ndepth reconstruction and spatially-varying color illuminations for\nhyperspectral reflectance reconstruction. To jointly reconstruct the depth and\nthe hyperspectral reflectance from a single color-dot image, we propose a novel\nend-to-end network architecture that effectively incorporates a geometric\ncolor-dot pattern loss and a photometric hyperspectral reflectance loss.\nThrough the experiments, we demonstrate that our hyperspectral-depth\nreconstruction method outperforms the combination of an existing\nstate-of-the-art single-shot hyperspectral reflectance reconstruction method\nand depth reconstruction method.",

    "abstract": "Modern software systems are usually highly configurable, providing users with\ncustomized functionality through various configuration options. Understanding\nhow system performance varies with different option combinations is important\nto determine optimal configurations that meet specific requirements. Due to the\ncomplex interactions among multiple options and the high cost of performance\nmeasurement under a huge configuration space, it is challenging to study how\ndifferent configurations influence the system performance. To address these\nchallenges, we propose HINNPerf, a novel hierarchical interaction neural\nnetwork for performance prediction of configurable systems. HINNPerf employs\nthe embedding method and hierarchic network blocks to model the complicated\ninterplay between configuration options, which improves the prediction accuracy\nof the method. Besides, we devise a hierarchical regularization strategy to\nenhance the model robustness. Empirical results on 10 real-world configurable\nsystems show that our method statistically significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches by achieving average 22.67% improvement in\nprediction accuracy. In addition, combined with the Integrated Gradients\nmethod, the designed hierarchical architecture provides some insights about the\ninteraction complexity and the significance of configuration options, which\nmight help users and developers better understand how the configurable system\nworks and efficiently identify significant options affecting the performance.",

    "abstract": "As clean ImageNet accuracy nears its ceiling, the research community is\nincreasingly more concerned about robust accuracy under distributional shifts.\nWhile a variety of methods have been proposed to robustify neural networks,\nthese techniques often target models trained on ImageNet classification. At the\nsame time, it is a common practice to use ImageNet pretrained backbones for\ndownstream tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and image\nclassification from different domains. This raises a question: Can these robust\nimage classifiers transfer robustness to downstream tasks? For object detection\nand semantic segmentation, we find that a vanilla Swin Transformer, a variant\nof Vision Transformer tailored for dense prediction tasks, transfers robustness\nbetter than Convolutional Neural Networks that are trained to be robust to the\ncorrupted version of ImageNet. For CIFAR10 classification, we find that models\nthat are robustified for ImageNet do not retain robustness when fully\nfine-tuned. These findings suggest that current robustification techniques tend\nto emphasize ImageNet evaluations. Moreover, network architecture is a strong\nsource of robustness when we consider transfer learning.",

    "abstract": "Recent image captioning models are achieving impressive results based on\npopular metrics, i.e., BLEU, CIDEr, and SPICE. However, focusing on the most\npopular metrics that only consider the overlap between the generated captions\nand human annotation could result in using common words and phrases, which\nlacks distinctiveness, i.e., many similar images have the same caption. In this\npaper, we aim to improve the distinctiveness of image captions via comparing\nand reweighting with a set of similar images. First, we propose a\ndistinctiveness metric -- between-set CIDEr (CIDErBtw) to evaluate the\ndistinctiveness of a caption with respect to those of similar images. Our\nmetric reveals that the human annotations of each image in the MSCOCO dataset\nare not equivalent based on distinctiveness; however, previous works normally\ntreat the human annotations equally during training, which could be a reason\nfor generating less distinctive captions. In contrast, we reweight each\nground-truth caption according to its distinctiveness during training. We\nfurther integrate a long-tailed weight strategy to highlight the rare words\nthat contain more information, and captions from the similar image set are\nsampled as negative examples to encourage the generated sentence to be unique.\nFinally, extensive experiments are conducted, showing that our proposed\napproach significantly improves both distinctiveness (as measured by CIDErBtw\nand retrieval metrics) and accuracy (e.g., as measured by CIDEr) for a wide\nvariety of image captioning baselines. These results are further confirmed\nthrough a user study.",

    "abstract": "Literature on machine learning for multiple sclerosis has primarily focused\non the use of neuroimaging data such as magnetic resonance imaging and clinical\nlaboratory tests for disease identification. However, studies have shown that\nthese modalities are not consistent with disease activity such as symptoms or\ndisease progression. Furthermore, the cost of collecting data from these\nmodalities is high, leading to scarce evaluations. In this work, we used\nmulti-dimensional, affordable, physical and smartphone-based performance\noutcome measures (POM) in conjunction with demographic data to predict multiple\nsclerosis disease progression. We performed a rigorous benchmarking exercise on\ntwo datasets and present results across 13 clinically actionable prediction\nendpoints and 6 machine learning models. To the best of our knowledge, our\nresults are the first to show that it is possible to predict disease\nprogression using POMs and demographic data in the context of both clinical\ntrials and smartphone-base studies by using two datasets. Moreover, we\ninvestigate our models to understand the impact of different POMs and\ndemographics on model performance through feature ablation studies. We also\nshow that model performance is similar across different demographic subgroups\n(based on age and sex). To enable this work, we developed an end-to-end\nreusable pre-processing and machine learning framework which allows quicker\nexperimentation over disparate MS datasets.",

    "abstract": "Various deep neural networks (DNNs) are developed and reported for their\ntremendous success in multiple domains. Given a specific task, developers can\ncollect massive DNNs from public sources for efficient reusing and avoid\nredundant work from scratch. However, testing the performance (e.g., accuracy\nand robustness) of multiple DNNs and giving a reasonable recommendation that\nwhich model should be used is challenging regarding the scarcity of labeled\ndata and demand of domain expertise. Existing testing approaches are mainly\nselection-based where after sampling, a few of the test data are labeled to\ndiscriminate DNNs. Therefore, due to the randomness of sampling, the\nperformance ranking is not deterministic. In this paper, we propose a\nlabeling-free comparison testing approach to overcome the limitations of\nlabeling effort and sampling randomness. The main idea is to learn a Bayesian\nmodel to infer the models' specialty only based on predicted labels. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we undertook exhaustive experiments\non 9 benchmark datasets spanning in the domains of image, text, and source\ncode, and 165 DNNs. In addition to accuracy, we consider the robustness against\nsynthetic and natural distribution shifts. The experimental results demonstrate\nthat the performance of existing approaches degrades under distribution shifts.\nOur approach outperforms the baseline methods by up to 0.74 and 0.53 on\nSpearman's correlation and Kendall's $\\tau$, respectively, regardless of the\ndataset and distribution shift. Additionally, we investigated the impact of\nmodel quality (accuracy and robustness) and diversity (standard deviation of\nthe quality) on the testing effectiveness and observe that there is a higher\nchance of a good result when the quality is over 50\\% and the diversity is\nlarger than 18\\%.",

The proper\nmanagement and exploitation of big data can pave the way for the substantial\ngrowth of the global economy as well as citizen satisfaction.

This paper first\nproposes a scalable focused Web Crawler engine based on the distributed\ncomputing platforms to extract and process fashion data on e-commerce websites.\nThe role of the proposed platform is then described in developing a\ndisentangled feature extraction method by employing deep convolutional\ngenerative adversarial networks (DCGANs) for content-based image indexing and\nretrieval. Finally, the state-of-the-art solutions are compared, and the\nresults of the proposed approach are analyzed on a standard dataset.

    "abstract": "Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) define a probability distribution on relational\nstructures over varying domain sizes. Many works have noticed that MLNs, like\nmany other relational models, do not admit consistent marginal inference over\nvarying domain sizes. Furthermore, MLNs learnt on a certain domain do not\ngeneralize to new domains of varied sizes. In recent works, connections have\nemerged between domain size dependence, lifted inference and learning from\nsub-sampled domains. The central idea to these works is the notion of\nprojectivity. The probability distributions ascribed by projective models\nrender the marginal probabilities of sub-structures independent of the domain\ncardinality. Hence, projective models admit efficient marginal inference,\nremoving any dependence on the domain size. Furthermore, projective models\npotentially allow efficient and consistent parameter learning from sub-sampled\ndomains. In this paper, we characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor a two-variable MLN to be projective. We then isolate a special model in\nthis class of MLNs, namely Relational Block Model (RBM). We show that, in terms\nof data likelihood maximization, RBM is the best possible projective MLN in the\ntwo-variable fragment.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Engagement Detection with Multi-Task Training\n(ED-MTT) system which minimizes mean squared error and triplet loss together to\ndetermine the engagement level of students in an e-learning environment. The\nperformance of this system is evaluated and compared against the\nstate-of-the-art on a publicly available dataset as well as videos collected\nfrom real-life scenarios.

A common challenge in many of the\nknown variants of this approach is that they require the numerical\napproximation of some integrals over an unbounded integral whose integrand\ndecays rather slowly which implies that their numerical handling is difficult\nand costly. We present a novel variant of such a diffusive representation. This\nform also requires the numerical approximation of an integral over an unbounded\ndomain, but the integrand decays much faster.

    "abstract": "The use of 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is seen as a promising\napproach to significantly reduce the power consumption and hardware cost of\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receivers. However, the nonlinear\ndistortion due to 1-bit quantization fundamentally changes the optimal\ncommunication strategy and also imposes a capacity penalty to the system. In\nthis paper, the capacity of a Gaussian MIMO channel in which the antenna\noutputs are processed by an analog linear combiner and then quantized by a set\nof zero threshold ADCs is studied. A new capacity upper bound for the zero\nthreshold case is established that is tighter than the bounds available in the\nliterature. In addition, we propose an achievability scheme which configures\nthe analog combiner to create parallel Gaussian channels with phase\nquantization at the output. Under this class of analog combiners, an algorithm\nis presented that identifies the analog combiner and input distribution that\nmaximize the achievable rate. Numerical results are provided showing that the\nrate of the achievability scheme is tight in the low signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) regime. Finally, a new 1-bit MIMO receiver architecture which employs\nanalog temporal and spatial processing is proposed. The proposed receiver\nattains the capacity in the high SNR regime.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the notion of change in systems and software\nengineering, emphasizing its philosophical elucidation. Generally, it has been\nclaimed that change is so pervasive in systems that it almost defeats\ndescription and analysis. In this article, we analyze change using the\nconceptual modeling technique called a thinging machine (TM), which reflects\nchange in terms of the actions of creating, processing, releasing,\ntransferring, and receiving things. We illustrated change in TM modeling with\nan example of a system s reconfiguration of business product handling designed\nusing business process modeling notation (BPMN). Then we analyze the notion of\nchange and compare its various definitions in philosophy. Specifically, we\nexamine Zeno s paradox that involves how to account for change and continuity\ntogether in moving things. The problem is that we cannot assert that an arrow\nis actually moving when it has been shot from a bow because the arrow needs to\nbe at a certain place at each point in time, which by definition cannot contain\nany duration at all. In our analysis of this problem, we convert the arrow\ntrajectory into space units called thimacs. In the TM generic actions, two\ntypes of change are identified: state and progression (PROCESS) changes.\nTherefore, when an arrow flows to a TM machine that represents a trajectory\nspace unit, it is rejected, causing it to bounce away to the outside. That is,\nthe arrow is transferred, arrives, and is transferred back; therefore, the\narrow is never accepted into a thimac in the trajectory at any moment. The\nresult of such analysis seems to introduce a logical explanation for the notion\nof movement discussed in Zeno s puzzles.",

With this in mind,\nwe explore behaviour-aware learning by examining several fine-tuning schemes\nusing HateCheck, a suite of functional tests for hate speech detection systems.\nTo address potential pitfalls of training on data originally intended for\nevaluation, we train and evaluate models on different configurations of\nHateCheck by holding out categories of test cases, which enables us to estimate\nperformance on potentially overlooked system properties. The fine-tuning\nprocedure led to improvements in the classification accuracy of held-out\nfunctionalities and identity groups, suggesting that models can potentially\ngeneralise to overlooked functionalities.

    "abstract": "One of the requirements for team sports analysis is to track and recognize\nplayers. Many tracking and reidentification methods have been proposed in the\ncontext of video surveillance. They show very convincing results when tested on\npublic datasets such as the MOT challenge. However, the performance of these\nmethods are not as satisfactory when applied to player tracking. Indeed, in\naddition to moving very quickly and often being occluded, the players wear the\nsame jersey, which makes the task of reidentification very complex. Some recent\ntracking methods have been developed more specifically for the team sport\ncontext. Due to the lack of public data, these methods use private datasets\nthat make impossible a comparison with them. In this paper, we propose a new\ngeneric method to track team sport players during a full game thanks to few\nhuman annotations collected via a semi-interactive system. Non-ambiguous\ntracklets and their appearance features are automatically generated with a\ndetection and a reidentification network both pre-trained on public datasets.\nThen an incremental learning mechanism trains a Transformer to classify\nidentities using few game-specific human annotations. Finally, tracklets are\nlinked by an association algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency of our\napproach on a challenging rugby sevens dataset. To overcome the lack of public\nsports tracking dataset, we publicly release this dataset at\nhttps://kalisteo.cea.fr/index.php/free-resources/. We also show that our method\nis able to track rugby sevens players during a full match, if they are\nobservable at a minimal resolution, with the annotation of only 6 few seconds\nlength tracklets per player.",

For SSIC\nnetworking, an SSIC dispatcher at the source dispatches duplicates of packets\nover multiple streams, which may be established over different physical\nwireless networks. If a packet on a stream cannot be decoded due to wireless\ninterference or noise, the decoder makes available the packet's soft\ninformation. An aggregator then combines the soft information of the duplicates\nto boost reliability. Of importance are two challenges: i) how to descramble\nthe scrambled soft information from different streams to enable correct SSIC;\nii) the construct of an SSIC dispatching and aggregation framework compatible\nwith commercial network interface cards (NICs) and TCP/IP networks. To address\nthe challenges, we put forth: i) a soft descrambling (SD) method to minimize\nthe bit-error rate (BER) and packet-error rate (PER) at the SSIC's output; ii)\nan SSIC networking architecture readily deployable over today's TCP/IP networks\nwithout specialized NICs.

    "abstract": "It is well known that if $m$ balls (jobs) are placed sequentially into $n$\nbins (servers) according to the One-Choice protocol $-$ choose a single bin in\neach round and allocate one ball to it $-$ then, for $m \\gg n$, the gap between\nthe maximum and average load diverges. Many refinements of the One-Choice\nprotocol have been studied that achieve a gap that remains bounded by a\nfunction of $n$, for any $m$. However most of these variations, such as\nTwo-Choice, are less sample-efficient than One-Choice, in the sense that for\neach allocated ball more than one sample is needed (in expectation).\nWe introduce a new class of processes which are primarily characterized by\n\"filling\" underloaded bins. A prototypical example is the Packing process: At\neach round we only take one bin sample, if the load is below the average load,\nthen we place as many balls until the average load is reached; otherwise, we\nplace only one ball. We prove that for any process in this class the gap\nbetween the maximum and average load is $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ for any number of\nballs $m$. For the Packing process, we also prove a matching lower bound. We\nalso prove that the Packing process is more sample-efficient than One-Choice,\nthat is, it allocates on average more than one ball per sample. Finally, we\nalso demonstrate that the upper bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ on the gap can\nbe extended to the Caching process (a.k.a. memory protocol) studied by\nMitzenmacher, Prabhakar and Shah (2002).",

In case of identifying an LPV model of a nonlinear\nsystem, the selection of the scheduling, i.e., the scheduling map that\ndescribes its relation to measurable signals in the system, is put on the\nusers' shoulder, with only limited supporting tools available. Although, such a\nchoice greatly affects the usability and the complexity of the resulting LPV\nmodel. This paper presents a deep-learning based approach to provide joint\nestimation of a scheduling map and an LPV state-space model of a nonlinear\nsystem from input-output data. The approach has consistency guarantees under\ngeneral innovation type of noise conditions, and its efficiency is demonstrated\non the identification problem of a control moment gyroscope.",

    "abstract": "Mobility data is essential for cities and communities to identify areas for\nnecessary improvement. Data collected by mobility providers already contains\nall the information necessary, but privacy of the individuals needs to be\npreserved. Differential privacy (DP) defines a mathematical property which\nguarantees that certain limits of privacy are preserved while sharing such\ndata, but its functionality and privacy protection are difficult to explain to\nlaypeople. In this paper, we adapt risk communication formats in conjunction\nwith a model for the privacy risks of DP. The result are privacy notifications\nwhich explain the risk to an individual's privacy when using DP, rather than\nDP's functionality. We evaluate these novel privacy communication formats in a\ncrowdsourced study. We find that they perform similarly to the best performing\nDP communications used currently in terms of objective understanding, but did\nnot make our participants as confident in their understanding. We also\ndiscovered an influence, similar to the Dunning-Kruger effect, of the\nstatistical numeracy on the effectiveness of some of our privacy communication\nformats and the DP communication format used currently. These results generate\nhypotheses in multiple directions, for example, toward the use of risk\nvisualization to improve the understandability of our formats or toward\nadaptive user interfaces which tailor the risk communication to the\ncharacteristics of the reader.",

    "abstract": "One intriguing property of adversarial attacks is their \"transferability\" --\nan adversarial example crafted with respect to one deep neural network (DNN)\nmodel is often found effective against other DNNs as well. Intensive research\nhas been conducted on this phenomenon under simplistic controlled conditions.\nYet, thus far, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding about\ntransferability-based attacks (\"transfer attacks\") in real-world environments.\nTo bridge this critical gap, we conduct the first large-scale systematic\nempirical study of transfer attacks against major cloud-based MLaaS platforms,\ntaking the components of a real transfer attack into account. The study leads\nto a number of interesting findings which are inconsistent to the existing\nones, including: (1) Simple surrogates do not necessarily improve real transfer\nattacks. (2) No dominant surrogate architecture is found in real transfer\nattacks. (3) It is the gap between posterior (output of the softmax layer)\nrather than the gap between logit (so-called $\\kappa$ value) that increases\ntransferability. Moreover, by comparing with prior works, we demonstrate that\ntransfer attacks possess many previously unknown properties in real-world\nenvironments, such as (1) Model similarity is not a well-defined concept. (2)\n$L_2$ norm of perturbation can generate high transferability without usage of\ngradient and is a more powerful source than $L_\\infty$ norm. We believe this\nwork sheds light on the vulnerabilities of popular MLaaS platforms and points\nto a few promising research directions.",

    "abstract": "Coordinate compounds (CCs) and elaborate expressions (EEs) are coordinate\nconstructions common in languages of East and Southeast Asia. Mortensen (2006)\nclaims that (1) the linear ordering of EEs and CCs in Hmong, Lahu, and Chinese\ncan be predicted via phonological hierarchies and (2) these phonological\nhierarchies lack a clear phonetic rationale. These claims are significant\nbecause morphosyntax has often been seen as in a feed-forward relationship with\nphonology, and phonological generalizations have often been assumed to be\nphonetically \"natural\". We investigate whether the ordering of CCs and EEs can\nbe learned empirically and whether computational models (classifiers and\nsequence labeling models) learn unnatural hierarchies similar to those posited\nby Mortensen (2006). We find that decision trees and SVMs learn to predict the\norder of CCs/EEs on the basis of phonology, with DTs learning hierarchies\nstrikingly similar to those proposed by Mortensen. However, we also find that a\nneural sequence labeling model is able to learn the ordering of elaborate\nexpressions in Hmong very effectively without using any phonological\ninformation. We argue that EE ordering can be learned through two independent\nroutes: phonology and lexical distribution, presenting a more nuanced picture\nthan previous work. [ISO 639-3:hmn, lhu, cmn]",

    "abstract": "Malware authors are continuously evolving their code base to include\ncounter-analysis methods that can significantly hinder their detection and\nblocking. While the execution of malware in a sandboxed environment may provide\na lot of insightful feedback about what the malware actually does in a machine,\nanti-virtualisation and hooking evasion methods may allow malware to bypass\nsuch detection methods. The main objective of this work is to complement\nsandbox execution with the use of binary emulation frameworks. The core idea is\nto exploit the fact that binary emulation frameworks may quickly test samples\nquicker than a sandbox environment as they do not need to open a whole new\nvirtual machine to execute the binary. While with this approach, we lose the\ngranularity of the data that can be collected through a sandbox, due to\nscalability issues, one may need to simply determine whether a file is\nmalicious or to which malware family it belongs. To this end, we record the API\ncalls that are performed and use them to explore the efficacy of using them as\nfeatures for binary and multiclass classification. Our extensive experiments\nwith real-world malware illustrate that this approach is very accurate,\nachieving state-of-the art outcomes with a statistically robust set of\nclassification experiments while simultaneously having a relatively low\ncomputational overhead compared to traditional sandbox approaches. In fact, we\ncompare the binary analysis results with a commercial sandbox, and our\nclassification outperforms it at the expense of the fine-grained results that a\nsandbox provides.",

Moreover, in the case of\nuncertain supply/demand, how to mobilize delay-tolerant elastic loads and\ncompensate real-time inelastic loads to match multi-energy generation/storage\nand minimize energy cost is a key issue. Since energy management is hardly to\nbe implemented offline without knowing statistical information of random\nvariables, this paper presents a systematic online energy cost minimization\nframework to fulfill the complementary utilization of multi-energy with\ntime-varying generation, demand and price. Specifically to achieve\ncharging/discharging constraints due to storage and short-term energy\nbalancing, a fast distributed algorithm based on stochastic gradient with\ntwo-timescale implementation is proposed to ensure online implementation. To\nreduce the peak loads, an incentive mechanism is implemented by estimating\nusers' willingness to shift.

Despite the great synthesis quality,\ntraining GANs often confronts several issues, including non-convergence, mode\ncollapse, and gradient vanishing. There exist several workarounds, for example,\nregularizing Lipschitz continuity and adopting Wasserstein distance. Although\nthese methods can partially solve the problems, we argue that the problems are\nresult from modeling the discriminator with deep neural networks. In this\npaper, we base on newly derived deep neural network theories called Neural\nTangent Kernel (NTK) and propose a new generative algorithm called generative\nadversarial NTK (GA-NTK). The GA-NTK models the discriminator as a Gaussian\nProcess (GP). With the help of the NTK theories, the training dynamics of\nGA-NTK can be described with a closed-form formula. To synthesize data with the\nclosed-form formula, the objectives can be simplified into a single-level\nadversarial optimization problem. We conduct extensive experiments on\nreal-world datasets, and the results show that GA-NTK can generate images\ncomparable to those by GANs but is much easier to train under various\nconditions.

In certain cases, however, an expensive optimization approach (i.e.\nwith relatively low number of FFEs) must be taken, and such a setting is\nconsidered in this work. The paper introduces an extension to the well-known\nLSHADE algorithm in the form of a pre-screening mechanism (psLSHADE). The\nproposed pre-screening relies on the three following components: a specific\ninitial sampling procedure, an archive of samples, and a global linear\nmeta-model of a fitness function that consists of 6 independent transformations\nof variables. The pre-screening mechanism preliminary assesses the trial\nvectors and designates the best one of them for further evaluation with the\ntrue fitness function. The performance of psLSHADE is evaluated using the\nCEC2021 benchmark in an expensive scenario with an optimization budget of\n10^2-10^4 FFEs per dimension. We compare psLSHADE with the baseline LSHADE\nmethod and the MadDE algorithm. The results indicate that with restricted\noptimization budgets (10^2-10^3) psLSHADE visibly outperforms both competitive\nalgorithms.

Recently, besides network services,\nWiFi sensing is appealing in smart homes since it is device-free,\ncost-effective and privacy-preserving. Though numerous WiFi sensing methods\nhave been developed, most of them only consider single smart home scenario.\nWithout the connection of powerful cloud server and massive users, large-scale\nWiFi sensing is still difficult. In this paper, we firstly analyze and\nsummarize these obstacles, and propose an efficient large-scale WiFi sensing\nframework, namely EfficientFi. The EfficientFi works with edge computing at\nWiFi APs and cloud computing at center servers. It consists of a novel deep\nneural network that can compress fine-grained WiFi Channel State Information\n(CSI) at edge, restore CSI at cloud, and perform sensing tasks simultaneously.\nA quantized auto-encoder and a joint classifier are designed to achieve these\ngoals in an end-to-end fashion. To the best of our knowledge, the EfficientFi\nis the first IoT-cloud-enabled WiFi sensing framework that significantly\nreduces communication overhead while realizing sensing tasks accurately. We\nutilized human activity recognition and identification via WiFi sensing as two\ncase studies, and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the EfficientFi.\nThe results show that it compresses CSI data from 1.368Mb/s to 0.768Kb/s with\nextremely low error of data reconstruction and achieves over 98% accuracy for\nhuman activity recognition.",

The textured 3D models from\nstandard photogrammetric pipelines are suboptimal to these applications because\nthese textures are directly derived from images, which intrinsically embedded\nthe spatially and temporally variant environmental lighting information, such\nas the sun illumination, direction, causing different looks of the surface,\nmaking such models less realistic when used in 3D rendering under synthetic\nlightings. On the other hand, since albedo images are less variable by\nenvironmental lighting, it can, in turn, benefit basic photogrammetric\nprocessing. In this paper, we attack the problem of albedo recovery for aerial\nimages for the photogrammetric process and demonstrate the benefit of albedo\nrecovery for photogrammetry data processing through enhanced feature matching\nand dense matching. To this end, we proposed an image formation model with\nrespect to outdoor aerial imagery under natural illumination conditions; we\nthen, derived the inverse model to estimate the albedo by utilizing the typical\nphotogrammetric products as an initial approximation of the geometry. The\nestimated albedo images are tested in intrinsic image decomposition,\nrelighting, feature matching, and dense matching/point cloud generation\nresults.

    "abstract": "Video anomaly detection refers to the identification of events that deviate\nfrom the expected behavior. Due to the lack of anomalous samples in training,\nvideo anomaly detection becomes a very challenging task. Existing methods\nalmost follow a reconstruction or future frame prediction mode. However, these\nmethods ignore the consistency between appearance and motion information of\nsamples, which limits their anomaly detection performance. Anomalies only occur\nin the moving foreground of surveillance videos, so the semantics expressed by\nvideo frame sequences and optical flow without background information in\nanomaly detection should be highly consistent and significant for anomaly\ndetection. Based on this idea, we propose Appearance-Motion Semantics\nRepresentation Consistency (AMSRC), a framework that uses normal data's\nappearance and motion semantic representation consistency to handle anomaly\ndetection. Firstly, we design a two-stream encoder to encode the appearance and\nmotion information representations of normal samples and introduce constraints\nto further enhance the consistency of the feature semantics between appearance\nand motion information of normal samples so that abnormal samples with low\nconsistency appearance and motion feature representation can be identified.\nMoreover, the lower consistency of appearance and motion features of anomalous\nsamples can be used to generate predicted frames with larger reconstruction\nerror, which makes anomalies easier to spot.

    "title": "Capacity Analysis of Intersections When CAVs Crossing in a Collaborative  and Lane-Free Order",
    "abstract": "Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are capable of passing through an\nintersection in a lane-free order that significantly improves their throughput\nas compared to the human-driven vehicles (HVs) crossing a signalised\nintersection. However, it is challenging to quantify such an improvement\nbecause the available theoretical framework to analyse capacity (i.e., the\nmaximum throughput) of the conventional intersections is not applicable to the\nlane-free intersections. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a\nnovel framework to consistently quantify and hence compare the capacity of\nlane-free and conventional intersections. The generated results by the\ndeveloped framework show that the lane-free crossing improves the capacity of\nintersections by respectively, 607% and 743% as compared to a signalised\ncrossing managed by the state-of-the-art max-pressure and Webster algorithms.\nUsing the developed framework, a sensitivity analysis of the capacity of\nlane-free and signalised intersections in terms of variation of initial speed,\nmaximum speed and maximum acceleration of vehicles is also provided.",

    "abstract": "Not until recently, robust bipedal locomotion has been achieved through\nreinforcement learning. However, existing implementations rely heavily on\ninsights and efforts from human experts, which is costly for the iterative\ndesign of robot systems. Also, styles of the learned motion are strictly\nlimited to that of the reference. In this paper, we propose a new way to learn\nbipedal locomotion from a simple sine wave as the reference for foot heights.\nWith the naive human insight that the two feet should be lifted up\nalternatively and periodically, we experimentally demonstrate on the Cassie\nrobot that, a simple reward function is able to make the robot learn to walk\nend-to-end and efficiently without any explicit knowledge of the model. With\ncustom sine waves, the learned gait pattern can also have customized styles.\nCodes will be released at github.com/WooQi57/sin-cassie-rl.",

    "title": "Stable Matching: Choosing Which Proposals to Make",
    "abstract": "Why does stable matching work well in practice despite agents only providing\nshort preference lists? Perhaps the most compelling explanation is due to Lee\n(Lee, 2016). He considered a model with preferences based on correlated\ncardinal utilities. The utilities were based on common public values for each\nagent and individual private values. He showed that for suitable utility\nfunctions, in large markets, for most agents, all stable matchings yield\nsimilar valued utilities.\nBy means of a new analysis, we strengthen this result, showing that in large\nmarkets, with high probability, for \\emph{all} but the bottommost agents, all\nstable matches yield similar valued utilities. We can then deduce that for\n\\emph{all} but the bottommost agents, relatively short preference lists\nsuffice.\nOur analysis shows that the key distinction is between models in which the\nderivatives of the utility function are bounded, and those in which they can be\nunbounded. For the bounded derivative model, we show that for any given\nconstant $c\\ge 1$, with $n$ agents on each side of the market, with probability\n$1 - n^{-c}$, for each agent its possible utilities in all stable matches vary\nby at most $O((c\\ln n/n)^{1/3})$ for all but the bottommost $O((c\\ln\nn/n)^{1/3})$ fraction of the agents. When the derivatives can be unbounded, we\nobtain the following bound on the utility range and the bottommost fraction:\nfor any constant $\\epsilon>0$, for large enough $n$, the bound is $\\epsilon$.\nBoth these bounds are tight. In the bounded derivative model, we also show the\nexistence of an $\\epsilon$-Bayes-Nash equilibrium in which agents make\nrelatively few proposals. Our results all rely on a new technique for\nsidestepping the conditioning between the matching events that occur over the\ncourse of a run of the Deferred Acceptance algorithm. We complement these\ntheoretical results with a variety of simulation experiments.",

This study proposes an\nentirely unsupervised deep-learning model for speaker diarization.\nSpecifically, the study focuses on generating high-quality neural speaker\nrepresentations without any annotated data, as well as on estimating secondary\nhyperparameters of the model without annotations.\nThe speaker embeddings are represented by an encoder trained in a\nself-supervised fashion using pairs of adjacent segments assumed to be of the\nsame speaker. The trained encoder model is then used to self-generate\npseudo-labels to subsequently train a similarity score between different\nsegments of the same call using probabilistic linear discriminant analysis\n(PLDA) and further to learn a clustering stopping threshold. We compared our\nmodel to state-of-the-art unsupervised as well as supervised baselines on the\nCallHome benchmarks.

However, the study of maximizing\nsubmodular functions has mainly been restricted in the context of selecting a\nset of items. On the other hand, many real-world applications require a\nsolution that is a ranking over a set of items. The problem of ranking in the\ncontext of submodular function maximization has been considered before, but to\na much lesser extent than item-selection formulations. In this paper, we\nexplore a novel formulation for ranking items with submodular valuations and\nbudget constraints. We refer to this problem as max-submodular ranking (MSR).\nIn more detail, given a set of items and a set of non-decreasing submodular\nfunctions, where each function is associated with a budget, we aim to find a\nranking of the set of items that maximizes the sum of values achieved by all\nfunctions under the budget constraints. For the MSR problem with cardinality-\nand knapsack-type budget constraints we propose practical algorithms with\napproximation guarantees.

Every\nday, millions of people play video games, not only as a hobby, but also for\nprofessional competitions (e.g., e-sports or speed-running) or for making\nbusiness by entertaining others (e.g., streamers). The latter daily produce a\nlarge amount of gameplay videos in which they also comment live what they\nexperience. Since no software and, thus, no video game is perfect, streamers\nmay encounter several problems (such as bugs, glitches, or performance issues).\nHowever, it is unlikely that they explicitly report such issues to developers.\nThe identified problems may negatively impact the user's gaming experience and,\nin turn, can harm the reputation of the game and of the producer.

Among 3D computer vision techniques,\nLight Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is currently considered at the industrial\nlevel for robotic vision. LiDAR is an imaging technique that monitors pulses of\nlight at optical frequencies to sense the space and to recover\nthree-dimensional ranging information. Notwithstanding the efforts on LiDAR\nintegration and optimization, commercially available devices have slow frame\nrate and low image resolution, notably limited by the performance of mechanical\nor slow solid-state deflection systems. Metasurfaces (MS) are versatile optical\ncomponents that can distribute the optical power in desired regions of space.\nHere, we report on an advanced LiDAR technology that uses ultrafast low FoV\ndeflectors cascaded with large area metasurfaces to achieve large FoV and\nsimultaneous peripheral and central imaging zones. This technology achieves MHz\nframe rate for 2D imaging, and up to KHz for 3D imaging, with extremely large\nFoV (up to 150{\\deg}deg. on both vertical and horizontal scanning axes). The\nuse of this disruptive LiDAR technology with advanced learning algorithms\noffers perspectives to improve further the perception capabilities and\ndecision-making process of autonomous vehicles and robotic systems.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning high dimensional polynomial\ntransformations of Gaussians. Given samples of the form $p(x)$, where $x\\sim\nN(0, \\mathrm{Id}_r)$ is hidden and $p: \\mathbb{R}^r \\to \\mathbb{R}^d$ is a\nfunction where every output coordinate is a low-degree polynomial, the goal is\nto learn the distribution over $p(x)$. This problem is natural in its own\nright, but is also an important special case of learning deep generative\nmodels, namely pushforwards of Gaussians under two-layer neural networks with\npolynomial activations. Understanding the learnability of such generative\nmodels is crucial to understanding why they perform so well in practice.\nOur first main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for learning quadratic\ntransformations of Gaussians in a smoothed setting. Our second main result is a\npolynomial-time algorithm for learning constant-degree polynomial\ntransformations of Gaussian in a smoothed setting, when the rank of the\nassociated tensors is small. In fact our results extend to any\nrotation-invariant input distribution, not just Gaussian. These are the first\nend-to-end guarantees for learning a pushforward under a neural network with\nmore than one layer.\nAlong the way, we also give the first polynomial-time algorithms with\nprovable guarantees for tensor ring decomposition, a popular generalization of\ntensor decomposition that is used in practice to implicitly store large\ntensors.",

To address this problem, we propose a novel\nsegmentation model called PlutoNet which requires only 2,626,337 parameters\nwhile outperforming state-of-the-art models on multiple medical image\nsegmentation tasks. We use EfficientNetB0 architecture as a backbone and\npropose the novel modified partial decoder, which is a combination of partial\ndecoder and full scale connections, which further reduces the number of\nparameters required, as well as captures semantic details. We use asymmetric\nconvolutions to handle varying polyp sizes. Finally, we weight each feature map\nto improve segmentation by using a squeeze and excitation block.

However, the performance of the current ASD classification\nbased on rs-fMRI still needs to be improved. This paper introduces a\nclassification framework to aid ASD diagnosis based on rs-fMRI. In the\nframework, we proposed a novel filter feature selection method based on the\ndifference between step distribution curves (DSDC) to select remarkable\nfunctional connectivities (FCs) and utilized a multilayer perceptron (MLP)\nwhich was pretrained by a simplified Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for\nclassification.

Our\nmodel was evaluated by 10 times 10-fold cross-validation and achieved an\naverage accuracy of 78.12%, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods reported\non the same dataset.

The reconstruction process\ncan be an ill-conditioned inverse problem, requiring regularization to obtain\nsatisfactory reconstructions. Recently, deep learning has been adopted for\ntomographic reconstruction. Unlike iterative algorithms which require a\ndistribution that is known a priori, deep reconstruction networks can learn a\nprior distribution through sampling the training distributions. In this work,\nwe develop a Physics-assisted Generative Adversarial Network (PGAN), a two-step\nalgorithm for tomographic reconstruction. In contrast to previous efforts, our\nPGAN utilizes maximum-likelihood estimates derived from the measurements to\nregularize the reconstruction with both known physics and the learned prior.\nSynthetic objects with spatial correlations are integrated circuits (IC) from a\nproposed model CircuitFaker. Compared with maximum-likelihood estimation, PGAN\ncan reduce the photon requirement with limited projection angles to achieve a\ngiven error rate. We further attribute the improvement to the learned prior by\nreconstructing objects created without spatial correlations.

The\ndecisions of CNN are explained using visual attribution methods. We have the\nfollowing three main findings.

(2) On data\nfrom Solar Cycle 23, a stacking ensemble that combines predictions from LSTM\nand CNN using the TSS criterion achieves significantly higher TSS than the\n\"select-best\" strategy with a confidence level of at least 0.95. (3) A visual\nattribution method called Integrated Gradients is able to attribute the CNN's\npredictions of flares to the emerging magnetic flux in the active region.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused millions of cases and deaths and the\nAI-related scientific community, after being involved with detecting COVID-19\nsigns in medical images, has been now directing the efforts towards the\ndevelopment of methods that can predict the progression of the disease. This\ntask is multimodal by its very nature and, recently, baseline results achieved\non the publicly available AIforCOVID dataset have shown that chest X-ray scans\nand clinical information are useful to identify patients at risk of severe\noutcomes. While deep learning has shown superior performance in several medical\nfields, in most of the cases it considers unimodal data only. In this respect,\nwhen, which and how to fuse the different modalities is an open challenge in\nmultimodal deep learning. To cope with these three questions here we present a\nnovel approach optimizing the setup of a multimodal end-to-end model. It\nexploits Pareto multi-objective optimization working with a performance metric\nand the diversity score of multiple candidate unimodal neural networks to be\nfused. We test our method on the AIforCOVID dataset, attaining state-of-the-art\nresults, not only outperforming the baseline performance but also being robust\nto external validation. Moreover, exploiting XAI algorithms we figure out a\nhierarchy among the modalities and we extract the features' intra-modality\nimportance, enriching the trust on the predictions made by the model.",

    "abstract": "In this work we study a simple mathematical model for drinking behavior\nevolution. For this purpose, we considered three compartments, namely\nSusceptible individuals $S$ (nonconsumers), Moderated drinkers $M$ and Risk\ndrinkers $R$. Inside the $S$ and $R$ compartments, we considered the presence\nof inflexible or zealot agents, i.e., individuals that never change their\nbehavior (never drink or always drink a lot). These inflexible agents are\ndescribed by fixed densities $s_I$ and $r_I$, for nonconsumer inflexible and\nrisk drinking inflexible individuals, respectively. We analyze the impact of\nthe presence of such special agents in the evolution of drinking behavior in\nthe population. Specifically, since the presence of inflexible agents are\nsimilar to the introduction of quenched disorder in the model, we are\ninterested in the impact of such disorder in the critical behavior of the\nsystem. Our analytical and numerical results indicate that the presence of only\none class of inflexible agents, $s_I$ or $r_I$, destroys one of the two\npossible absorbing phases that are observed in the model without such\ninflexibles, i.e., for $s_i=r_I=0$. In the presence of the both kinds of\ninflexible agents simultaneously, there are no absorbing states anymore. Since\nabsorbing states are collective macroscopic states with the presence of only\none kind of individuals in the population, nonconsumers or risk drinkers, we\nargue that the inclusion of inflexible agents in the population makes the model\nmore realistic. In addition, the work makes a contribution to studies on the\nimpact of quenched disorder in nonequilibrium phase transitions, that are a\nsubject of interest for Nonequilibrium Statistical Physics.",

In this work, we\npresent Personal VAD 2.0, a personalized voice activity detector that detects\nthe voice activity of a target speaker, as part of a streaming on-device ASR\nsystem. Although previous proof-of-concept studies have validated the\neffectiveness of Personal VAD, there are still several critical challenges to\naddress before this model can be used in production: first, the quality must be\nsatisfactory in both enrollment and enrollment-less scenarios; second, it\nshould operate in a streaming fashion; and finally, the model size should be\nsmall enough to fit a limited latency and CPU/Memory budget. To meet the\nmulti-faceted requirements, we propose a series of novel designs: 1) advanced\nspeaker embedding modulation methods; 2) a new training paradigm to generalize\nto enrollment-less conditions; 3) architecture and runtime optimizations for\nlatency and resource restrictions.

In this paper we turn our\nattention to matrix groups, whose usefulness within this framework was\nrelatively unexplored.\nWe first show that groups of Lie type cannot prove $\\omega=2$ within the\ngroup-theoretic approach. This is based on a representation-theoretic argument\nthat identifies the second-smallest dimension of an irreducible representation\nof a group as a key parameter that determines its viability in this framework.\nOur proof builds on Gowers' result concerning product-free sets in quasirandom\ngroups. We then give another barrier that rules out certain natural matrix\ngroup constructions that make use of subgroups that are far from being\nself-normalizing.\nOur barrier results leave open several natural paths to obtain $\\omega = 2$\nvia matrix groups. To explore these routes we propose working in the continuous\nsetting of Lie groups, in which we develop an analogous theory. Obtaining the\nanalogue of $\\omega=2$ in this potentially easier setting is a key challenge\nthat represents an intermediate goal short of actually proving $\\omega = 2$.

We show that common attacks in the\nliterature (Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD),\nCarlini-Wagner (CW) with different Lp threat models) can be classified with an\naccuracy of ~96%.

State-of-the-art strategies address the\nproblem as a supervised learning task and optimize algorithms that predict\nsubgrid fluxes based on information from coarse resolution models. In practice,\ntraining data are generated from higher resolution numerical simulations\ntransformed in order to mimic coarse resolution simulations.

This paper investigates the properties of\nmargin-based cross-entropy losses leading to such a shift and aims to find\nscoring back-ends best suited for speaker verification. In addition, we revisit\nthe pre-processing techniques which have been widely used in the past and\nassess their effectiveness on large-margin embeddings. Experiments on the\nstate-of-the-art ECAPA-TDNN networks trained with various large-margin softmax\ncross-entropy losses show a substantial increment in intra-speaker compactness\nmaking the conventional PLDA superfluous. In this regard, we found that\nconstraining the within-speaker covariance matrix could improve the performance\nof the PLDA. It is demonstrated through a series of experiments on the\nVoxCeleb-1 and SITW core-core test sets with 40.8% equal error rate (EER)\nreduction and 35.1% minimum detection cost (minDCF) reduction. It also\noutperforms cosine scoring consistently with reductions in EER and minDCF by\n10.9% and 4.9%, respectively.",

Recent advances in\nnon-autoregressive TTS (NAR-TTS) models have significantly improved the\ninference speed and robustness of synthesized speech. However, the diversity of\nspeaking styles and naturalness are needed to be improved. To solve this\nproblem, we propose the HiMuV-TTS model that first determines the global-scale\nprosody and then determines the local-scale prosody via conditioning on the\nglobal-scale prosody and the learned text representation. In addition, we\nimprove the quality of speech by adopting the adversarial training technique.\nExperimental results verify that the proposed HiMuV-TTS model can generate more\ndiverse and natural speech as compared to TTS models with single-scale\nvariational autoencoders, and can represent different prosody information in\neach scale.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a neural auto-encoder that transforms the voice\nintensity in recordings of singing voice. Since most recordings of singing\nvoice are not annotated with voice intensity we propose a means to estimate the\nrelative voice intensity from the signal's timbre using a neural intensity\nestimator. Two methods to overcome the unknown recording factor that relates\nvoice intensity to recorded signal power are given: The unknown recording\nfactor can either be learned alongside the weights of the intensity estimator,\nor a special loss function based on the scalar product can be used to only\nmatch the intensity contour of the recorded signal's power. The intensity\nmodels are used to condition a previously introduced bottleneck auto-encoder\nthat disentangles its input, the mel-spectrogram, from the intensity. We\nevaluate the intensity models by their consistency and by their fitness to\nprovide useful information to the auto-encoder. A perceptive test is carried\nout that evaluates the perceived intensity change in transformed recordings and\nthe synthesis quality. The perceptive test confirms that changing the\nconditional input changes the perceived intensity accordingly thus suggesting\nthat the proposed intensity models encode information about the voice\nintensity.",

Automatic and objective\nmeasures are desirable to assist therapists in their traditionally subjective\nand labor-intensive assessments. In this work, we investigate a novel approach\nfor obtaining such a measure using the divergence in disentangled latent speech\nrepresentations of a parallel utterance pair, obtained from a healthy reference\nand a pathological speaker. Experiments on an English database of Cerebral\nPalsy patients, using all available utterances per speaker, show high and\nsignificant correlation values (R = -0.9) with subjective intelligibility\nmeasures, while having only minimal deviation (+-0.01) across four different\nreference speaker pairs.

The vessel morphology plays a critical role\nin the underlying hemodynamical computation, for which 3D geometries are\nobtained via imaging techniques from patients CTA or MRI scans. To evaluate the\npatients current risks suffering vessel wall damage or an ischaemic stroke,\nareas of interest are closely observed. A main indicator for these defects is\nthe stress the blood is exerting on the surrounding vessel tissue. The wall\nshear stress (WSS) and its cyclic evaluation as the oscillatory shear index\n(OSI) can be used as an indicator for future medical procedures. As a result of\nlow resolution imaging and craggy stenotic surface areas, the geometry model's\nmesh is often non smooth on the surface areas. The automatically generated\ntangential vector fields of such a surface topology are therefore corrupted.\nMaking an interpretation of the orientation dependent WSS not only difficult\nbut partially unreliable. In order to smooth out the erratic surface tangential\nfield we apply a projection of the vessel's center-line tangents of the to the\nsurface, based on a method introduced by Morbiducci et al. The validation of\nour approach is made by comparing the orientation focused evaluation of the WSS\nto the generic method with automatically generated tangential vectors.

    "abstract": "Significant effort has been made to solve computationally expensive\noptimization problems in the past two decades, and various optimization methods\nincorporating surrogates into optimization have been proposed. Most research\nfocuses on either exploiting the surrogate by defining a utility optimization\nproblem or customizing an existing optimization method to use one or multiple\napproximation models. However, only a little attention has been paid to generic\nconcepts applicable to different types of algorithms and optimization problems\nsimultaneously. Thus this paper proposes a generalized probabilistic\nsurrogate-assisted framework (GPSAF), applicable to a broad category of\nunconstrained and constrained, single- and multi-objective optimization\nalgorithms. The idea is based on a surrogate assisting an existing optimization\nmethod. The assistance is based on two distinct phases, one facilitating\nexploration and another exploiting the surrogates. The exploration and\nexploitation of surrogates are automatically balanced by performing a\nprobabilistic knockout tournament among different clusters of solutions. A\nstudy of multiple well-known population-based optimization algorithms is\nconducted with and without the proposed surrogate assistance on single- and\nmulti-objective optimization problems with a maximum solution evaluation budget\nof 300 or less. The results indicate the effectiveness of applying GPSAF to an\noptimization algorithm and the competitiveness with other surrogate-assisted\nalgorithms.",

    "abstract": "In intra coding, Rate Distortion Optimization (RDO) is performed to achieve\nthe optimal intra mode from a pre-defined candidate list. The optimal intra\nmode is also required to be encoded and transmitted to the decoder side besides\nthe residual signal, where lots of coding bits are consumed. To further improve\nthe performance of intra coding in Versatile Video Coding (VVC), an intelligent\nintra mode derivation method is proposed in this paper, termed as Deep Learning\nbased Intra Mode Derivation (DLIMD). In specific, the process of intra mode\nderivation is formulated as a multi-class classification task, which aims to\nskip the module of intra mode signaling for coding bits reduction. The\narchitecture of DLIMD is developed to adapt to different quantization parameter\nsettings and variable coding blocks including non-square ones, which are\nhandled by one single trained model. Different from the existing deep learning\nbased classification problems, the hand-crafted features are also fed into the\nintra mode derivation network besides the learned features from feature\nlearning network. To compete with traditional method, one additional binary\nflag is utilized in the video codec to indicate the selected scheme with RDO.\nExtensive experimental results reveal that the proposed method can achieve\n2.28%, 1.74%, and 2.18% bit rate reduction on average for Y, U, and V\ncomponents on the platform of VVC test model, which outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art works.",

    "abstract": "Particle tracking in biological imaging is concerned with reconstructing the\ntrajectories, locations, or velocities of the targeting particles. The standard\napproach of particle tracking consists of two steps: first reconstructing\nstatically the source locations in each time step, and second applying tracking\ntechniques to obtain the trajectories and velocities. In contrast, the dynamic\nreconstruction seeks to simultaneously recover the source locations and\nvelocities from all frames, which enjoys certain advantages. In this paper, we\nprovide a rigorous mathematical analysis for the resolution limit of\nreconstructing source number, locations, and velocities by general dynamical\nreconstruction in particle tracking problems, by which we demonstrate the\npossibility of achieving super-resolution for the dynamic reconstruction. We\nshow that when the location-velocity pairs of the particles are separated\nbeyond certain distances (the resolution limits), the number of particles and\nthe location-velocity pair can be stably recovered. The resolution limits are\nrelated to the cut-off frequency of the imaging system, signal-to-noise ratio,\nand the sparsity of the source. By these estimates, we also derive a stability\nresult for a sparsity-promoting dynamic reconstruction. In addition, we further\nshow that the reconstruction of velocities has a better resolution limit which\nimproves constantly as the particles moving. This result is derived by an\nobservation that the inherent cut-off frequency for the velocity recovery can\nbe viewed as the total observation time multiplies the cut-off frequency of the\nimaging system, which may lead to a better resolution limit as compared to the\none for each diffraction-limited frame. It is anticipated that this observation\ncan inspire new reconstruction algorithms that improve the resolution of\nparticle tracking in practice.",

Such systems have shown real-world success for\nscientific exploration and discovery, including the first discovery of a\nbest-in-class material. To build and use these systems, the next generation\nworkforce requires expertise in diverse areas including ML, control systems,\nmeasurement science, materials synthesis, decision theory, among others.\nHowever, education is lagging. Educators need a low-cost, easy-to-use platform\nto teach the required skills. Industry can also use such a platform for\ndeveloping and evaluating autonomous physical science methodologies. We present\nthe next generation in science education, a kit for building a low-cost\nautonomous scientist. The kit was used during two courses at the University of\nMaryland to teach undergraduate and graduate students autonomous physical\nscience. We discuss its use in the course and its greater capability to teach\nthe dual tasks of autonomous model exploration, optimization, and\ndetermination, with an example of autonomous experimental \"discovery\" of the\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this work is to apply a denoising image transformer to remove the\ndistortion from underwater images and compare it with other similar approaches.\nAutomatic restoration of underwater images plays an important role since it\nallows to increase the quality of the images, without the need for more\nexpensive equipment. This is a critical example of the important role of the\nmachine learning algorithms to support marine exploration and monitoring,\nreducing the need for human intervention like the manual processing of the\nimages, thus saving time, effort, and cost. This paper is the first application\nof the image transformer-based approach called \"Pre-Trained Image Processing\nTransformer\" to underwater images. This approach is tested on the UFO-120\ndataset, containing 1500 images with the corresponding clean images.",

    "title": "Legitimate against Illegitimate IRSs on MISO Wiretap Channels",
    "abstract": "The low-cost legitimate intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are applied to\nthe wiretap channel in physical layer security to enhance the secrecy rate. In\npractice, the eavesdropper can also deploy an IRS, namely illegitimate IRS, to\ndeteriorate the secrecy rate. This paper studies the interplay between a\ntransmitter, a legitimate IRS, and an illegitimate IRS in a multiple-input\nsingle-output (MISO) wiretap channel. We formulate a max-min secrecy rate\nproblem, where all the information is available at the transmitter and the\nreceivers. We aim to design an efficient transmit beamforming and phase\nshifting strategy of the legitimate IRS, under the worst-case secrecy rate\nachieved based on optimizing the phase-shifting strategy of the illegitimate\nIRS. We propose three solution methods based on the gradient descent ascent\n(GDA), the alternate optimization (AO), and the mixed Nash equilibrium (NE) in\nzero-sum games in strategic form. Simulation results show that for the\ncontinuous phase-shifting strategies, AO usually does not guarantee\nconvergence, although it may achieve better performance than GDA in some\niterations. GDA usually converges to a stationary point. Discrete\nphase-shifting strategies improve the convergence behavior of AO and GDA, while\nthere is a single mixed NE with the highest secrecy rate.",
