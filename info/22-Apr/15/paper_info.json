    "title": "Estimating Structural Disparities for Face Models",
    "abstract": "In machine learning, disparity metrics are often defined by measuring the\ndifference in the performance or outcome of a model, across different\nsub-populations (groups) of datapoints. Thus, the inputs to disparity\nquantification consist of a model's predictions $\\hat{y}$, the ground-truth\nlabels for the predictions $y$, and group labels $g$ for the data points.\nPerformance of the model for each group is calculated by comparing $\\hat{y}$\nand $y$ for the datapoints within a specific group, and as a result, disparity\nof performance across the different groups can be calculated. In many real\nworld scenarios however, group labels ($g$) may not be available at scale\nduring training and validation time, or collecting them might not be feasible\nor desirable as they could often be sensitive information. As a result,\nevaluating disparity metrics across categorical groups would not be feasible.\nOn the other hand, in many scenarios noisy groupings may be obtainable using\nsome form of a proxy, which would allow measuring disparity metrics across\nsub-populations. Here we explore performing such analysis on computer vision\nmodels trained on human faces, and on tasks such as face attribute prediction\nand affect estimation. Our experiments indicate that embeddings resulting from\nan off-the-shelf face recognition model, could meaningfully serve as a proxy\nfor such estimation.",

To evaluate each frame of the video based on the character(s)\npresent in it, characters (faces) are evaluated in two aspects:\nFacial-expression: We train a CNN model to measure whether a face has an\nacceptable facial expression for being in a video thumbnail. This model is\ntrained to distinguish faces extracted from artworks/thumbnails, from faces\nextracted from random frames of videos. Prominence and interactions:\nCharacter(s) in the thumbnail should be important character(s) in the video, to\nprevent the algorithm from suggesting non-representative frames as candidates.\nWe use face clustering to identify the characters in the video, and form a\ngraph in which the prominence (frequency of appearance) of the character(s),\nand their interactions (co-occurrence) are captured. We use this graph to infer\nthe relevance of the characters present in each candidate frame. Once every\nface is scored based on the two criteria above, we infer frame level scores by\ncombining the scores for all the faces within a frame.",

Our efficient perturbation-based\napproach empirically estimates the importance of each point by testing the\nmodel with randomly generated subsets of the input point cloud. Our\nsub-sampling strategy takes into account the special characteristics of LiDAR\ndata, such as the depth-dependent point density. We show a detailed evaluation\nof the attribution maps and demonstrate that they are interpretable and highly\ninformative.

While there is much anecdotal, empirical, and theoretical\nanalysis of causal confusion and reward gaming behaviors both in reinforcement\nlearning and imitation learning approaches that directly map from states to\nactions, we provide the first systematic study of causal confusion in the\ncontext of learning reward functions from preferences. To facilitate this\nstudy, we identify a set of three preference learning benchmark domains where\nwe observe causal confusion when learning from offline datasets of pairwise\ntrajectory preferences: a simple reacher domain, an assistive feeding domain,\nand an itch-scratching domain. To gain insight into this observed causal\nconfusion, we present a sensitivity analysis that explores the effect of\ndifferent factors--including the type of training data, reward model capacity,\nand feature dimensionality--on the robustness of rewards learned from\npreferences. We find evidence that learning rewards from pairwise trajectory\npreferences is highly sensitive and non-robust to spurious features and\nincreasing model capacity, but not as sensitive to the type of training data.\nVideos, code, and supplemental results are available at\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/causal-reward-confusion.",

    "abstract": "Face reconstruction and tracking is a building block of numerous applications\nin AR/VR, human-machine interaction, as well as medical applications. Most of\nthese applications rely on a metrically correct prediction of the shape,\nespecially, when the reconstructed subject is put into a metrical context\n(i.e., when there is a reference object of known size). A metrical\nreconstruction is also needed for any application that measures distances and\ndimensions of the subject (e.g., to virtually fit a glasses frame).\nState-of-the-art methods for face reconstruction from a single image are\ntrained on large 2D image datasets in a self-supervised fashion. However, due\nto the nature of a perspective projection they are not able to reconstruct the\nactual face dimensions, and even predicting the average human face outperforms\nsome of these methods in a metrical sense. To learn the actual shape of a face,\nwe argue for a supervised training scheme. Since there exists no large-scale 3D\ndataset for this task, we annotated and unified small- and medium-scale\ndatabases. The resulting unified dataset is still a medium-scale dataset with\nmore than 2k identities and training purely on it would lead to overfitting. To\nthis end, we take advantage of a face recognition network pretrained on a\nlarge-scale 2D image dataset, which provides distinct features for different\nfaces and is robust to expression, illumination, and camera changes. Using\nthese features, we train our face shape estimator in a supervised fashion,\ninheriting the robustness and generalization of the face recognition network.\nOur method, which we call MICA (MetrIC fAce), outperforms the state-of-the-art\nreconstruction methods by a large margin, both on current non-metric benchmarks\nas well as on our metric benchmarks (15% and 24% lower average error on NoW,\nrespectively).",

    "title": "CAMERO: Consistency Regularized Ensemble of Perturbed Language Models  with Weight Sharing",
    "abstract": "Model ensemble is a popular approach to produce a low-variance and\nwell-generalized model. However, it induces large memory and inference costs,\nwhich are often not affordable for real-world deployment. Existing work has\nresorted to sharing weights among models. However, when increasing the\nproportion of the shared weights, the resulting models tend to be similar, and\nthe benefits of using model ensemble diminish. To retain ensemble benefits\nwhile maintaining a low memory cost, we propose a consistency-regularized\nensemble learning approach based on perturbed models, named CAMERO.\nSpecifically, we share the weights of bottom layers across all models and apply\ndifferent perturbations to the hidden representations for different models,\nwhich can effectively promote the model diversity. Meanwhile, we apply a\nprediction consistency regularizer across the perturbed models to control the\nvariance due to the model diversity. Our experiments using large language\nmodels demonstrate that CAMERO significantly improves the generalization\nperformance of the ensemble model. Specifically, CAMERO outperforms the\nstandard ensemble of 8 BERT-base models on the GLUE benchmark by 0.7 with a\nsignificantly smaller model size (114.2M vs. 880.6M).",

    "abstract": "Matching-based networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance for video\nobject segmentation (VOS) tasks by storing every-k frames in an external memory\nbank for future inference. Storing the intermediate frames' predictions\nprovides the network with richer cues for segmenting an object in the current\nframe. However, the size of the memory bank gradually increases with the length\nof the video, which slows down inference speed and makes it impractical to\nhandle arbitrary length videos.\nThis paper proposes an adaptive memory bank strategy for matching-based\nnetworks for semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS) that can handle\nvideos of arbitrary length by discarding obsolete features. Features are\nindexed based on their importance in the segmentation of the objects in\nprevious frames. Based on the index, we discard unimportant features to\naccommodate new features. We present our experiments on DAVIS 2016, DAVIS 2017,\nand Youtube-VOS that demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art\nthat employ first-and-latest strategy with fixed-sized memory banks and\nachieves comparable performance to the every-k strategy with increasing-sized\nmemory banks. Furthermore, experiments show that our method increases inference\nspeed by up to 80% over the every-k and 35% over first-and-latest strategies.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a computationally efficient methodology to predict the\ndamage progression in solder contacts of electronic components using\ntemperature-time curves. For this purpose, two machine learning algorithms, a\nMultilayer Perceptron and a Long Short-Term Memory network, are trained and\ncompared with respect to their prediction accuracy and the required amount of\ntraining data. The training is performed using synthetic, normally distributed\ndata that is realistic for automotive applications. A finite element model of a\nsimple bipolar chip resistor in surface mount technology configuration is used\nto numerically compute the synthetic data. As a result, both machine learning\nalgorithms show a relevant accuracy for the prediction of accumulated creep\nstrains. With a training data length of 350 hours (12.5% of the available\ntraining data), both models show a constantly good fitting performance of $R^2$\nof 0.72 for the Multilayer Perceptron and $R^2$ of 0.87 for the Long Short-Term\nMemory network. The prediction errors of the accumulated creep strains are less\nthan 10% with an amount of 350 hours training data and decreases to less than 5\n% when using further data. Therefore, both approaches are promising for the\nlifetime prediction directly on the electronic device.",

In recent years, many\nresearch is conducted in accelerating the performance of SpMV on the graphic\nprocessing units (GPU).

In this study, we are trying to minimize the data\nmovements cost for GPU-based SpMV using a new framework named \"explicit caching\nHybrid (EHYB)\".

However, freeing from declaring schemas does not mean their absence,\nbut rather that they are implicit in data and code. Therefore, diagramming\ntools similar to those available for relational systems are also needed to help\ndevelopers and administrators understanding NoSQL schemas.\nVisualizing diagrams is not practical if schemas contain hundreds of database\nentities, and exploration or query facilities are then needed. In schemaless\nNoSQL stores, data of the same entity can be stored with different structure\nwhich can increase the difficulty of having readable diagrams.\nNoSQL schema management tools should therefore have three main components:\nschema extraction, schema visualization, and schema query.

    "abstract": "Recent improvements in KG-to-text generation are due to additional auxiliary\npre-trained tasks designed to give the fine-tune task a boost in performance.\nThese tasks require extensive computational resources while only suggesting\nmarginal improvements. Here, we demonstrate that by fusing graph-aware elements\ninto existing pre-trained language models, we are able to outperform\nstate-of-the-art models and close the gap imposed by additional pre-train\ntasks. We do so by proposing a mask structure to capture neighborhood\ninformation and a novel type encoder that adds a bias to the graph-attention\nweights depending on the connection type. Experiments on two KG-to-text\nbenchmark datasets show these models to be superior in quality while involving\nfewer parameters and no additional pre-trained tasks. By formulating the\nproblem as a framework, we can interchange the various proposed components and\nbegin interpreting KG-to-text generative models based on the topological and\ntype information found in a graph.",

    "abstract": "Sketching is used as a ubiquitous tool of expression by novices and experts\nalike. In this thesis I explore two methods that help a system provide a\ngeometric machine-understanding of sketches, and in-turn help a user accomplish\na downstream task.\nThe first work deals with interpretation of a 2D-line drawing as a graph\nstructure, and also illustrates its effectiveness through its physical\nreconstruction by a robot. We setup a two-step pipeline to solve the problem.\nFormerly, we estimate the vertices of the graph with sub-pixel level accuracy.\nWe achieve this using a combination of deep convolutional neural networks\nlearned under a supervised setting for pixel-level estimation followed by the\nconnected component analysis for clustering. Later we follow it up with a\nfeedback-loop-based edge estimation method. To complement the\ngraph-interpretation, we further perform data-interchange to a robot legible\nASCII format, and thus teach a robot to replicate a line drawing.\nIn the second work, we test the 3D-geometric understanding of a sketch-based\nsystem without explicit access to the information about 3D-geometry. The\nobjective is to complete a contour-like sketch of a 3D-object, with\nillumination and texture information. We propose a data-driven approach to\nlearn a conditional distribution modelled as deep convolutional neural networks\nto be trained under an adversarial setting; and we validate it against a\nhuman-in-the-loop. The method itself is further supported by synthetic data\ngeneration using constructive solid geometry following a standard graphics\npipeline. In order to validate the efficacy of our method, we design a\nuser-interface plugged into a popular sketch-based workflow, and setup a simple\ntask-based exercise, for an artist. Thereafter, we also discover that\nform-exploration is an additional utility of our application.",

With the advent of additive manufacturing, M-TO\nhas gained significant prominence. However, generating optimal microstructures\nat various locations can be computationally very expensive. As an alternate,\ngraded multiscale topology optimization (GM-TO) has been proposed where one or\nmore pre-selected and graded (parameterized) microstructural topologies are\nused to fill the domain optimally. This leads to a significant reduction in\ncomputation while retaining many of the benefits of M-TO.\nA successful GM-TO framework must: (1) be capable of efficiently handling\nnumerous pre-selected microstructures, (2) be able to continuously switch\nbetween these microstructures during optimization, (3) ensure that the\npartition of unity is satisfied, and (4) discourage microstructure mixing at\ntermination.\nIn this paper, we propose to meet these requirements by exploiting the unique\nclassification capacity of neural networks.

    "abstract": "The research paper addresses linear decomposition of time series of\nnon-additive metrics that allows for the identification and interpretation of\ncontributing factors (input features) of variance. Non-additive metrics, such\nas ratios, are widely used in a variety of domains. It commonly requires\npreceding aggregations of underlying variables that are used to calculate the\nmetric of interest. The latest poses a dimensionality challenge when the input\nfeatures and underlying variables are formed as two-dimensional arrays along\nelements, such as account or customer identifications, and time points. It\nrules out direct modeling of the time series of a non-additive metric as a\nfunction of input features. The article discusses a five-step approach: (1)\nsegmentations of input features and the underlying variables of the metric that\nare supported by unsupervised autoencoders, (2) univariate or joint fittings of\nthe metric by the aggregated input features on the segmented domains, (3)\ntransformations of pre-screened input features according to the fitted models,\n(4) aggregation of the transformed features as time series, and (5) modelling\nof the metric time series as a sum of constrained linear effects of the\naggregated features. Alternatively, approximation by numerical differentiation\nhas been considered to linearize the metric. It allows for element level\nunivariate or joint modeling of step (2). The process of these analytical steps\nallows for a backward-looking explanatory decomposition of the metric as a sum\nof time series of the survived input features. The paper includes a synthetic\nexample that studies loss-to-balance monthly rates of a hypothetical retail\ncredit portfolio. To validate that no latent factors other than the survived\ninput features have significant impacts on the metric, Statistical Process\nControl has been introduced for the residual time series.",

Due to this data-driven nature, they\nhave achieved remarkable success in various areas. However, manual design and\nselection of suitable network architectures are time-consuming and require\nsubstantial effort of human experts. To address this problem, researchers have\nproposed neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms which can automatically\ngenerate network architectures but suffer from heavy computational cost and\ninstability if searching from scratch. In this paper, we propose a hybrid NAS\nframework for ultrasound (US) image classification and segmentation. The hybrid\nframework consists of a pre-trained backbone and several searched cells (i.e.,\nnetwork building blocks), which takes advantage of the strengths of both NAS\nand the expert knowledge from existing convolutional neural networks.\nSpecifically, two effective and lightweight operations, a mixed depth-wise\nconvolution operator and a squeeze-and-excitation block, are introduced into\nthe candidate operations to enhance the variety and capacity of the searched\ncells. These two operations not only decrease model parameters but also boost\nnetwork performance. Moreover, we propose a re-aggregation strategy for the\nsearched cells, aiming to further improve the performance for different vision\ntasks. We tested our method on two large US image datasets, including a 9-class\nechinococcosis dataset containing 9566 images for classification and an ovary\ndataset containing 3204 images for segmentation.

    "abstract": "Multi-Task Learning is a learning paradigm that uses correlated tasks to\nimprove performance generalization. A common way to learn multiple tasks is\nthrough the hard parameter sharing approach, in which a single architecture is\nused to share the same subset of parameters, creating an inductive bias between\nthem during the training process. Due to its simplicity, potential to improve\ngeneralization, and reduce computational cost, it has gained the attention of\nthe scientific and industrial communities. However, tasks often conflict with\neach other, which makes it challenging to define how the gradients of multiple\ntasks should be combined to allow simultaneous learning. To address this\nproblem, we use the idea of multi-objective optimization to propose a method\nthat takes into account temporal behaviour of the gradients to create a dynamic\nbias that adjust the importance of each task during the backpropagation. The\nresult of this method is to give more attention to the tasks that are diverging\nor that are not being benefited during the last iterations, allowing to ensure\nthat the simultaneous learning is heading to the performance maximization of\nall tasks. As a result, we empirically show that the proposed method\noutperforms the state-of-art approaches on learning conflicting tasks.

We further introduce Weight Fixation Mechanism to alleviate\nover-fitting, and analyze the working behavior of Batch Normalization, Leaky\nReLU and Dropout in frequency domain to design their counterparts for CEMNet.\nAlso, to deal with complex inputs brought by DFT, we design two branch network\nstructure for CEMNet. Experimental results imply that CEMNet works well in\nfrequency domain, and achieve good performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 databases.\nTo our knowledge, CEMNet is the first model trained in Fourier Domain that\nachieves more than 70\\% validation accuracy on CIFAR-10 database.",

The implementation of the NbE algorithm requires the presence\nof a strong monad in the Kripke interpretation of positive formulae, in analogy\nwith the extension of intuitionistic propositional logic with falsity and\ndisjunction.

    "abstract": "Semantic parsing (SP) is a core component of modern virtual assistants like\nGoogle Assistant and Amazon Alexa. While sequence-to-sequence-based\nauto-regressive (AR) approaches are common for conversational semantic parsing,\nrecent studies employ non-autoregressive (NAR) decoders and reduce inference\nlatency while maintaining competitive parsing quality. However, a major\ndrawback of NAR decoders is the difficulty of generating top-k (i.e., k-best)\noutputs with approaches such as beam search. To address this challenge, we\npropose a novel NAR semantic parser that introduces intent conditioning on the\ndecoder. Inspired by the traditional intent and slot tagging parsers, we\ndecouple the top-level intent prediction from the rest of a parse. As the\ntop-level intent largely governs the syntax and semantics of a parse, the\nintent conditioning allows the model to better control beam search and improves\nthe quality and diversity of top-k outputs. We introduce a hybrid\nteacher-forcing approach to avoid training and inference mismatch. We evaluate\nthe proposed NAR on conversational SP datasets, TOP & TOPv2. Like the existing\nNAR models, we maintain the O(1) decoding time complexity while generating more\ndiverse outputs and improving the top-3 exact match (EM) by 2.4 points.

While many studies\nfocus on informing DNNs with physics through differential equations or\nnumerical simulation, much may be gained through integration of simplified\nrelationships. To evaluate this hypothesis, a number of thin rectangular plates\nsimply-supported on all edges are simulated for five materials. With plate\ndimensions and material properties as input features and fundamental natural\nfrequency as the sole output, predictive performance of a purely data-driven\nDNN-based model is compared with models using additional inputs computed from\nsimplified physical relationships among baseline parameters, namely plate\nweight, modulus of rigidity, and shear modulus.

By training and evaluating our methods using longitudinal\nchest radiographs and electronic health records from two independent centers,\nwe demonstrate that MM-STGNN achieves AUROC of 0.79 on both primary and\nexternal datasets.

Lastly, qualitative model\ninterpretability analysis indicates that while patients' primary diagnoses were\nnot explicitly used to train the model, node features crucial for model\nprediction directly reflect patients' primary diagnoses.

However, our analysis of existing results\nshows that omission faults pose a significant challenge to these techniques.\nFor template based approaches, omission faults provide no location to apply\ntemplates to; for learning based approaches that formulate repair as Neural\nMachine Translation (NMT), omission faults similarly do not provide the faulty\ncode to translate. To address these issues, we propose GLAD, a novel\nlearning-based repair technique that specifically targets if-clause synthesis.\nGLAD does not require a faulty line as it is based on generative Language\nModels (LMs) instead of machine translation; consequently, it can repair\nomission faults. GLAD intelligently constrains the language model using a\ntype-based grammar. Further, it efficiently reduces the validation cost by\nperforming dynamic ranking of candidate patches using a debugger. Thanks to the\nshift from translation to synthesis, GLAD is highly orthogonal to existing\ntechniques: GLAD can correctly fix 16 Defects4J v1.2 faults that previous\nNMT-based techniques could not, while maintaining a reasonable runtime cost,\nunderscoring its utility as an APR tool and potential to complement existing\ntools in practice.

Once sub-optimal code is unknowingly (or knowingly) integrated\ninto the codebase of software systems, its accumulation may lead to large\nmaintenance costs and technical debt. Stack Overflow is a popular website for\nprogrammers to ask questions and share their code snippets. The crowdsourced\nand collaborative nature of Stack Overflow has created a large source of\nprogramming knowledge that can be leveraged to assist developers in their\nday-to-day activities. Objective: In this paper, we present an exploratory\nstudy to evaluate the usefulness of recommending code improvements based on\nStack Overflow answers' edits. Method: We propose Matcha, a code recommendation\ntool that leverages Stack Overflow code snippets with version history and code\nclone search techniques to identify sub-optimal code in software projects and\nsuggest their optimised version. By using SOTorrent and GitHub datasets, we\nwill quali-quantitatively investigate the usefulness of recommendations given\nby \\textsc{Matcha} to developers using manual categorisation of the\nrecommendations and acceptance of pull-requests to open-source projects.",

The motion model is calibrated online by the VIO system\nand can be used as a forward model for motion control and planning.

    "abstract": "Dense prediction in medical volume provides enriched guidance for clinical\nanalysis. CNN backbones have met bottleneck due to lack of long-range\ndependencies and global context modeling power. Recent works proposed to\ncombine vision transformer with CNN, due to its strong global capture ability\nand learning capability. However, most works are limited to simply applying\npure transformer with several fatal flaws (i.e., lack of inductive bias, heavy\ncomputation and little consideration for 3D data). Therefore, designing an\nelegant and efficient vision transformer learner for dense prediction in\nmedical volume is promising and challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel\n3D Shuffle-Mixer network of a new Local Vision Transformer-MLP paradigm for\nmedical dense prediction. In our network, a local vision transformer block is\nutilized to shuffle and learn spatial context from full-view slices of\nrearranged volume, a residual axial-MLP is designed to mix and capture\nremaining volume context in a slice-aware manner, and a MLP view aggregator is\nemployed to project the learned full-view rich context to the volume feature in\na view-aware manner. Moreover, an Adaptive Scaled Enhanced Shortcut is proposed\nfor local vision transformer to enhance feature along spatial and channel\ndimensions adaptively, and a CrossMerge is proposed to skip-connects the\nmulti-scale feature appropriately in the pyramid architecture. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art\nmedical dense prediction methods.",

Our proof is based on showing that\nthe rate of our feedback coding scheme equals an upper bound on the feedback\ncapacity derived using the single-letter bounding techniques of Sabag et al.\n(2017).

During this situation, the utilization of\nmicrogrids (MGs) may help the power systems balance the generation and\nconsumption of power, which leads to customer satisfaction. In this paper, the\noptimal power scheduling of energy sources in an islanded MG by considering the\nupside risk (UR) is proposed for the very first time.

The goals of this work are minimizing the\nenergy not supplied (ENS) in islanded mode considering the COVID-19s effect and\nimplementing the demand response program (DRP). The difference between target\nENS and actual ENS when actual ENS is less than the target is defined as UR.\nThe results indicate that the UR related to the ENS of the islanded MG\ndecreases significantly by slightly increasing the ENS.

RGB-based SOD methods lack the complementary depth clues; hence,\nproviding limited performance for complex scenarios. Similarly, RGB-D models\nprocess RGB and depth inputs, but the depth data availability during testing\nmay hinder the model's practical applicability. This paper exploits only RGB\nimages, estimates depth from RGB, and leverages the intermediate depth\nfeatures. We employ a pyramidal attention structure to extract multi-level\nconvolutional-transformer features to process initial stage representations and\nfurther enhance the subsequent ones. At each stage, the backbone transformer\nmodel produces global receptive fields and computing in parallel to attain\nfine-grained global predictions refined by our residual convolutional attention\ndecoder for optimal saliency prediction. We report significantly improved\nperformance against 21 and 40 state-of-the-art SOD methods on eight RGB and\nRGB-D datasets, respectively. Consequently, we present a new SOD perspective of\ngenerating RGB-D SOD without acquiring depth data during training and testing\nand assist RGB methods with depth clues for improved performance.

    "abstract": "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) continuously interact with their physical\nenvironments through software controllers that observe the environments and\ndetermine actions. Engineers can verify to what extent the CPS under analysis\ncan achieve given goals by analyzing its Field Operational Test (FOT) logs.\nHowever, it is challenging to repeat many FOTs to obtain statistically\nsignificant results due to its cost and risk in practice. To address this\nchallenge, simulation-based verification can be a good alternative for\nefficient CPS goal verification, but it requires an accurate virtual\nenvironment model that can replace the real environment that interacts with the\nCPS in a closed loop. This paper proposes a novel data-driven approach that\nautomatically generates the virtual environment model from a small amount of\nFOT logs. We formally define the environment model generation problem and solve\nit using Imitation Learning (IL) algorithms. In addition, we propose three\nspecific use cases of our approach in the evolutionary CPS development.

    "abstract": "We introduce YOLO-pose, a novel heatmap-free approach for joint detection,\nand 2D multi-person pose estimation in an image based on the popular YOLO\nobject detection framework. Existing heatmap based two-stage approaches are\nsub-optimal as they are not end-to-end trainable and training relies on a\nsurrogate L1 loss that is not equivalent to maximizing the evaluation metric,\ni.e. Object Keypoint Similarity (OKS). Our framework allows us to train the\nmodel end-to-end and optimize the OKS metric itself. The proposed model learns\nto jointly detect bounding boxes for multiple persons and their corresponding\n2D poses in a single forward pass and thus bringing in the best of both\ntop-down and bottom-up approaches. Proposed approach doesn't require the\npostprocessing of bottom-up approaches to group detected keypoints into a\nskeleton as each bounding box has an associated pose, resulting in an inherent\ngrouping of the keypoints. Unlike top-down approaches, multiple forward passes\nare done away with since all persons are localized along with their pose in a\nsingle inference. YOLO-pose achieves new state-of-the-art results on COCO\nvalidation (90.2% AP50) and test-dev set (90.3% AP50), surpassing all existing\nbottom-up approaches in a single forward pass without flip test, multi-scale\ntesting, or any other test time augmentation.

    "abstract": "Data stream classification is an important problem in the field of machine\nlearning. Due to the non-stationary nature of the data where the underlying\ndistribution changes over time (concept drift), the model needs to continuously\nadapt to new data statistics. Stream-based Active Learning (AL) approaches\naddress this problem by interactively querying a human expert to provide new\ndata labels for the most recent samples, within a limited budget. Existing AL\nstrategies assume that labels are immediately available, while in a real-world\nscenario the expert requires time to provide a queried label (verification\nlatency), and by the time the requested labels arrive they may not be relevant\nanymore. In this article, we investigate the influence of finite,\ntime-variable, and unknown verification delay, in the presence of concept drift\non AL approaches. We propose PRopagate (PR), a latency independent utility\nestimator which also predicts the requested, but not yet known, labels.\nFurthermore, we propose a drift-dependent dynamic budget strategy, which uses a\nvariable distribution of the labelling budget over time, after a detected\ndrift. Thorough experimental evaluation, with both synthetic and real-world\nnon-stationary datasets, and different settings of verification latency and\nbudget are conducted and analyzed. We empirically show that the proposed method\nconsistently outperforms the state-of-the-art. Additionally, we demonstrate\nthat with variable budget allocation in time, it is possible to boost the\nperformance of AL strategies, without increasing the overall labeling budget.",

    "abstract": "Computing systems are omnipresent; their sustainability has become crucial\nfor our society. A key aspect of this sustainability is the ability of\ncomputing systems to cope with the continuous change they face, ranging from\ndynamic operating conditions, to changing goals, and technological progress.\nWhile we are able to engineer smart computing systems that autonomously deal\nwith various types of changes, handling unanticipated changes requires system\nevolution, which remains in essence a human-centered process. This will\neventually become unmanageable. To break through the status quo, we put forward\nan arguable opinion for the vision of self-evolving computing systems that are\nequipped with an evolutionary engine enabling them to evolve autonomously.\nSpecifically, when a self-evolving computing system detects conditions outside\nits operational domain, such as an anomaly or a new goal, it activates an\nevolutionary engine that runs online experiments to determine how the system\nneeds to evolve to deal with the changes, thereby evolving its architecture.\nDuring this process the engine can integrate new computing elements that are\nprovided by computing warehouses. These computing elements provide\nspecifications and procedures enabling their automatic integration. We motivate\nthe need for self-evolving computing systems in light of the state of the art,\noutline a conceptual architecture of self-evolving computing systems, and\nillustrate the architecture for a future smart city mobility system that needs\nto evolve continuously with changing conditions. To conclude, we highlight key\nresearch challenges to realize the vision of self-evolving computing systems.",

However, the relationship between extrinsic and\nintrinsic bias is relatively unknown. In this work, we illuminate this\nrelationship by measuring both quantities together: we debias a model during\ndownstream fine-tuning, which reduces extrinsic bias, and measure the effect on\nintrinsic bias, which is operationalized as bias extractability with\ninformation-theoretic probing. Through experiments on two tasks and multiple\nbias metrics, we show that our intrinsic bias metric is a better indicator of\ndebiasing than (a contextual adaptation of) the standard WEAT metric, and can\nalso expose cases of superficial debiasing. Our framework provides a\ncomprehensive perspective on bias in NLP models, which can be applied to deploy\nNLP systems in a more informed manner. Our code will be made publicly\navailable.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a deep learning approach for vehicle detection in\nsatellite video. Vehicle detection is perhaps impossible in single EO satellite\nimages due to the tininess of vehicles (4-10 pixel) and their similarity to the\nbackground. Instead, we consider satellite video which overcomes the lack of\nspatial information by temporal consistency of vehicle movement. A new\nspatiotemporal model of a compact $3 \\times 3$ convolutional, neural network is\nproposed which neglects pooling layers and uses leaky ReLUs. Then we use a\nreformulation of the output heatmap including Non-Maximum-Suppression (NMS) for\nthe final segmentation. Empirical results on two new annotated satellite videos\nreconfirm the applicability of this approach for vehicle detection. They more\nimportantly indicate that pre-training on WAMI data and then fine-tuning on few\nannotated video frames for a new video is sufficient. In our experiment only\nfive annotated images yield a $F_1$ score of 0.81 on a new video showing more\ncomplex traffic patterns than the Las Vegas video. Our best result on Las Vegas\nis a $F_1$ score of 0.87 which makes the proposed approach a leading method for\nthis benchmark.",

To evaluate user QoE many researchers deploy subjective\nquality assessments where participants watch and rate videos artificially\ninfused with various temporal and spatial impairments. To aid current efforts\nin bridging the gap between the mapping of objective video QoE metrics to user\nexperience, we developed DashReStreamer, an open-source framework for\nre-creating adaptively streamed video in real networks.

    "abstract": "The ubiquity of implicit feedback makes them the default choice to build\nmodern recommender systems. Generally speaking, observed interactions are\nconsidered as positive samples, while unobserved interactions are considered as\nnegative ones. However, implicit feedback is inherently noisy because of the\nubiquitous presence of noisy-positive and noisy-negative interactions.\nRecently, some studies have noticed the importance of denoising implicit\nfeedback for recommendations, and enhanced the robustness of recommendation\nmodels to some extent. Nonetheless, they typically fail to (1) capture the hard\nyet clean interactions for learning comprehensive user preference, and (2)\nprovide a universal denoising solution that can be applied to various kinds of\nrecommendation models.\nIn this paper, we thoroughly investigate the memorization effect of\nrecommendation models, and propose a new denoising paradigm, i.e., Self-Guided\nDenoising Learning (SGDL), which is able to collect memorized interactions at\nthe early stage of the training (i.e., \"noise-resistant\" period), and leverage\nthose data as denoising signals to guide the following training (i.e.,\n\"noise-sensitive\" period) of the model in a meta-learning manner. Besides, our\nmethod can automatically switch its learning phase at the memorization point\nfrom memorization to self-guided learning, and select clean and informative\nmemorized data via a novel adaptive denoising scheduler to improve the\nrobustness. We incorporate SGDL with four representative recommendation models\n(i.e., NeuMF, CDAE, NGCF and LightGCN) and different loss functions (i.e.,\nbinary cross-entropy and BPR loss). The experimental results on three benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SGDL over the state-of-the-art\ndenoising methods like T-CE, IR, DeCA, and even state-of-the-art robust\ngraph-based methods like SGCN and SGL.",

    "abstract": "For the 2D laser-based tasks, e.g., people detection and people tracking, leg\ndetection is usually the first step. Thus, it carries great weight in\ndetermining the performance of people detection and people tracking. However,\nmany leg detectors ignore the inevitable noise and the multiscale\ncharacteristics of the laser scan, which makes them sensitive to the unreliable\nfeatures of point cloud and further degrades the performance of the leg\ndetector. In this paper, we propose a multiscale adaptive-switch Random Forest\n(MARF) to overcome these two challenges. Firstly, the adaptive-switch decision\ntree is designed to use noisesensitive features to conduct weighted\nclassification and noiseinvariant features to conduct binary classification,\nwhich makes our detector perform more robust to noise. Secondly, considering\nthe multiscale property that the sparsity of the 2D point cloud is proportional\nto the length of laser beams, we design a multiscale random forest structure to\ndetect legs at different distances. Moreover, the proposed approach allows us\nto discover a sparser human leg from point clouds than others. Consequently,\nour method shows an improved performance compared to other state-of-the-art leg\ndetectors on the challenging Moving Legs dataset and retains the whole pipeline\nat a speed of 60+ FPS on lowcomputational laptops. Moreover, we further apply\nthe proposed MARF to the people detection and tracking system, achieving a\nconsiderable gain in all metrics.",

While state of the art\nperson detectors reach competitive results on perspective images, missing CNN\narchitectures as well as training data that follows the distortion of\nomnidirectional images makes current approaches not applicable to our data. The\nmethod predicts bounding boxes of multiple persons directly in omnidirectional\nimages without perspective transformation, which reduces overhead of pre- and\npost-processing and enables real-time performance. The basic idea is to utilize\ntransfer learning to fine-tune CNNs trained on perspective images with data\naugmentation techniques for detection in omnidirectional images. We fine-tune\ntwo variants of Single Shot MultiBox detectors (SSDs). The first one uses\nMobilenet v1 FPN as feature extractor (moSSD). The second one uses ResNet50 v1\nFPN (resSSD). Both models are pre-trained on Microsoft Common Objects in\nContext (COCO) dataset. We fine-tune both models on PASCAL VOC07 and VOC12\ndatasets, specifically on class person. Random 90-degree rotation and random\nvertical flipping are used for data augmentation in addition to the methods\nproposed by original SSD. We reach an average precision (AP) of 67.3 % with\nmoSSD and 74.9 % with resSSD onthe evaluation dataset. To enhance the\nfine-tuning process, we add a subset of HDA Person dataset and a subset of\nPIROPOdatabase and reduce the number of perspective images to PASCAL VOC07. The\nAP rises to 83.2 % for moSSD and 86.3 % for resSSD, respectively. The average\ninference speed is 28 ms per image for moSSD and 38 ms per image for resSSD\nusing Nvidia Quadro P6000.

    "abstract": "The limited bandwidth of optical wireless communication (OWC) front-end\ndevices motivates the use of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) techniques\nto enhance data rates. It is known that very high multiplexing gains could be\nachieved by spatial multiplexing (SMX) in exchange for exhaustive detection\ncomplexity. Alternatively, in spatial modulation (SM), a single light emitting\ndiode (LED) is activated per time instance where information is carried by both\nthe signal and the LED index. Since only an LED is active, both transmitter\n(TX) and receiver (RX) complexity reduces significantly while retaining the\ninformation transmission in the spatial domain. However, significant spectral\nefficiency losses occur in SM compared to SMX. In this paper, we propose a\ntechnique which adopts the advantages of both systems. Accordingly, the\nproposed flexible LED index modulation (FLIM) technique harnesses the inactive\nstate of the LEDs as a transmit symbol. Therefore, the number of active LEDs\nchanges in each transmission, unlike conventional techniques. Moreover, the\nsystem complexity is reduced by employing a linear minimum mean squared error\n(MMSE) equalizer and an angle perturbed receiver at the RX. Numerical results\nshow that FLIM outperforms the reference systems by at least 6 dB in the low\nand medium/high spectral efficiency regions.",

As most state-of-the-art methods rely on\ntraining deep learning networks in a supervised fashion, they require huge\namounts of annotated data, which are rarely available. In this paper, we\npresent a novel generic semi-supervised method to train a network based on a\nlabeled image dataset by leveraging a large unlabeled dataset of soccer\nbroadcast videos. More precisely, we design a teacher-student approach in which\nthe teacher produces surrogate annotations on the unlabeled data to be used\nlater for training a student which has the same architecture as the teacher.\nFurthermore, we introduce three training loss parametrizations that allow the\nstudent to doubt the predictions of the teacher during training depending on\nthe proposal confidence score. We show that including unlabeled data in the\ntraining process allows to substantially improve the performances of the\ndetection network trained only on the labeled data. Finally, we provide a\nthorough performance study including different proportions of labeled and\nunlabeled data, and establish the first benchmark on the new SoccerNet-v3\ndetection task, with an mAP of 52.3%.

This\nphenomenon is mainly caused by neglecting subject-dependent information in\nmotion. To solve the problem, we propose a novel motion retargeting method\nwhich can combine both subject-independent (common motion content) information\nfrom a source video and subject-dependent (individualized identity motion)\ninformation from a target video. So it can synthesize videos with a much\nnatural appearance along with identity-preserved motion. In the proposed method\ntwo encoders are employed to extract identity and motion content\nrepresentations respectively. We employ the adaptive instance normalization\n(AdaIN) layer in the generator and the instance normalization (IN) layer in the\nmotion content encoder to synthesize the new motion. Besides, we also collected\na dataset, named $Chuang101$, with 101 subjects in total. Each subject performs\nidentical dancing movement, and so it is convenient for feature disentanglement\namong motion and identity of each subject. Furthermore, an efficient\nquantitative metric for identify information is designed by gait recognition.\nThe experiments show the proposed method can synthesize videos more naturally\nwhen the subject's identity is preserved.",

However, most presented inverter topologies have a restricted number\nof output voltage levels and limited output voltage boosting ratio. In\naddition, balancing the voltage of capacitors in multilevel converters is very\nimportant and should be considered in the topology or control method. This\npaper describes a generalized switched-capacitor circuit topology for\nmultilevel dc-to-ac inverters that can be developed for the desired output\nvoltage levels. Also, the maximum ac output voltage can vary from values much\nlower than the dc input voltage to several times of it depending on the design\nrequirement. High-voltage dc input and ac output could be handled using\nlow-voltage capacitors, which substantially decreases overall cost and volume.\nThe proposed topology further allows for easy expansion through stackable\ncircuits for multiple load phases. It has an inherent capacity for balancing\nthe voltage of capacitors. To validate the feasibility and practicality of this\nconcept, we provide circuit descriptions, control strategies, design\nrecommendations, and pertinent simulation findings for the suggested inverter\ntopology.",

    "abstract": "Distributed optimization concerns the optimization of a common function in a\ndistributed network, which finds a wide range of applications ranging from\nmachine learning to vehicle platooning. Its key operation is to aggregate all\nlocal state information (LSI) at devices to update their states. The required\nextensive message exchange and many iterations cause a communication bottleneck\nwhen the LSI is high dimensional or at high mobility. To overcome the\nbottleneck, we propose in this work the framework of distributed over-the-air\ncomputing (AirComp) to realize a one-step aggregation for distributed\noptimization by exploiting simultaneous multicast beamforming of all devices\nand the property of analog waveform superposition of a multi-access channel. We\nconsider two design criteria. The first one is to minimize the sum AirComp\nerror (i.e., sum mean-squared error (MSE)) with respect to the desired\naverage-functional values. An efficient solution approach is proposed by\ntransforming the non-convex beamforming problem into an equivalent\nconcave-convex fractional program and solving it by nesting convex programming\ninto a bisection search. The second criterion, called zero-forcing (ZF)\nmulticast beamforming, is to force the received over-the-air aggregated signals\nat devices to be equal to the desired functional values. In this case, the\noptimal beamforming admits closed form. Both the MMSE and ZF beamforming\nexhibit a centroid structure resulting from averaging columns of conventional\nMMSE/ZF precoding. Last, the convergence of a classic distributed optimization\nalgorithm is analyzed. The distributed AirComp is found to accelerate\nconvergence by dramatically reducing communication latency. Another key finding\nis that the ZF beamforming outperforms the MMSE design as the latter is shown\nto cause bias in subgradient estimation.",

    "abstract": "Most existing unsupervised person re-identification (Re-ID) methods use\nclustering to generate pseudo labels for model training. Unfortunately,\nclustering sometimes mixes different true identities together or splits the\nsame identity into two or more sub clusters. Training on these noisy clusters\nsubstantially hampers the Re-ID accuracy. Due to the limited samples in each\nidentity, we suppose there may lack some underlying information to well reveal\nthe accurate clusters. To discover these information, we propose an Implicit\nSample Extension (\\OurWholeMethod) method to generate what we call support\nsamples around the cluster boundaries. Specifically, we generate support\nsamples from actual samples and their neighbouring clusters in the embedding\nspace through a progressive linear interpolation (PLI) strategy. PLI controls\nthe generation with two critical factors, i.e., 1) the direction from the\nactual sample towards its K-nearest clusters and 2) the degree for mixing up\nthe context information from the K-nearest clusters. Meanwhile, given the\nsupport samples, ISE further uses a label-preserving loss to pull them towards\ntheir corresponding actual samples, so as to compact each cluster.\nConsequently, ISE reduces the \"sub and mixed\" clustering errors, thus improving\nthe Re-ID performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod is effective and achieves state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised\nperson Re-ID.

    "title": "To What Extent do Deep Learning-based Code Recommenders Generate  Predictions by Cloning Code from the Training Set?",
    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely used to support code completion.\nThese models, once properly trained, can take as input an incomplete code\ncomponent (e.g., an incomplete function) and predict the missing tokens to\nfinalize it. GitHub Copilot is an example of code recommender built by training\na DL model on millions of open source repositories: The source code of these\nrepositories acts as training data, allowing the model to learn \"how to\nprogram\". The usage of such a code is usually regulated by Free and Open Source\nSoftware (FOSS) licenses, that establish under which conditions the licensed\ncode can be redistributed or modified. As of Today, it is unclear whether the\ncode generated by DL models trained on open source code should be considered as\n\"new\" or as \"derivative\" work, with possible implications on license\ninfringements. In this work, we run a large-scale study investigating the\nextent to which DL models tend to clone code from their training set when\nrecommending code completions. Such an exploratory study can help in assessing\nthe magnitude of the potential licensing issues mentioned before: If these\nmodels tend to generate new code that is unseen in the training set, then\nlicensing issues are unlikely to occur. Otherwise, a revision of these licenses\nurges to regulate how the code generated by these models should be treated when\nused, for example, in a commercial setting. Highlights from our results show\nthat ~$10% to ~0.1% of the predictions generated by a state-of-the-art DL-based\ncode completion tool are Type-1 clones of instances in the training set,\ndepending on the size of the predicted code. Long predictions are unlikely to\nbe cloned.",

    "abstract": "Many problems in engineering and statistics involve both predictive\nforecasting and decision-based optimization. Traditionally, predictive models\nare optimized independently from the final decision-based optimization problem.\nIn contrast, a `smart, predict then optimize' (SPO) framework optimizes\nprediction models to explicitly minimize the final downstream decision loss. In\nthis paper we present dboost, a gradient boosting algorithm for training\nprediction model ensembles to minimize decision regret. The dboost framework\nsupports any convex optimization program that can be cast as convex quadratic\ncone program and gradient boosting is performed by implicit differentiation of\na custom fixed-point mapping. To our knowledge, the dboost framework is the\nfirst general purpose implementation of gradient boosting to predict and\noptimize problems.

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD), which is an effective way to train\nan object detection model using only image-level annotations, has attracted\nconsiderable attention from researchers. However, most of the existing methods,\nwhich are based on multiple instance learning (MIL), tend to localize instances\nto the discriminative parts of salient objects instead of the entire content of\nall objects. In this paper, we propose a WSOD framework called the Spatial\nLikelihood Voting with Self-knowledge Distillation Network (SLV-SD Net). In\nthis framework, we introduce a spatial likelihood voting (SLV) module to\nconverge region proposal localization without bounding box annotations.\nSpecifically, in every iteration during training, all the region proposals in a\ngiven image act as voters voting for the likelihood of each category in the\nspatial dimensions. After dilating the alignment on the area with large\nlikelihood values, the voting results are regularized as bounding boxes, which\nare then used for the final classification and localization. Based on SLV, we\nfurther propose a self-knowledge distillation (SD) module to refine the feature\nrepresentations of the given image. The likelihood maps generated by the SLV\nmodule are used to supervise the feature learning of the backbone network,\nencouraging the network to attend to wider and more diverse areas of the image.\nExtensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007/2012 and MS-COCO datasets\ndemonstrate the excellent performance of SLV-SD Net. In addition, SLV-SD Net\nproduces new state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks.",

When a neural network is instead faced with\nsubjectively defined labels--such as human demonstrations or annotations--SGD\nmay struggle to explore the deceptive and noisy loss landscapes caused by the\ninherent bias and subjectivity of humans. While neural networks are often\ntrained via preference learning algorithms in an effort to eliminate such data\nnoise, the de facto training methods rely on gradient descent. Motivated by the\nlack of empirical studies on the impact of evolutionary search to the training\nof preference learners, we introduce the RankNEAT algorithm which learns to\nrank through neuroevolution of augmenting topologies. We test the hypothesis\nthat RankNEAT outperforms traditional gradient-based preference learning within\nthe affective computing domain, in particular predicting annotated player\narousal from the game footage of three dissimilar games.

    "abstract": "Security is an essential cornerstone of functioning digital marketplaces and\ncommunities. If users doubt that data shared online will remain secure, they\nwill withdraw from platforms. Even when firms take these risks seriously,\nsecurity expertise is expensive and vulnerabilities are diverse in nature.\nIncreasingly, firms and governments are turning to bug bounty programs (BBPs)\nto crowdsource their cybersecurity, in which they pay individuals for reporting\nvulnerabilities in their systems. And while the use of BBPs has grown\nsignificantly in recent years, research on the actors in this market and their\nincentives remains limited. Using the lens of transaction cost economics, this\npaper examines the incentives of firms and researchers (sometimes called\nhackers) participating in BBPs.

However, a major drawback of this approach is\nthat most MCSs do not correspond to Pareto-optimal solutions. In fact, one can\nonly know that a given MCS corresponds to a Pareto-optimal solution when all\nMCSs are enumerated. Moreover, if it is not possible to enumerate all MCSs,\nthen there is no guarantee of the quality of the approximation of the Pareto\nfrontier. This paper extends the state of the art for solving MOBO using MCSs.\nFirst, we show that it is possible to use MCS enumeration to solve MOBO\nproblems such that each MCS necessarily corresponds to a Pareto-optimal\nsolution. Additionally, we also propose two new algorithms that can find a (1 +\n{\\varepsilon})-approximation of the Pareto frontier using MCS enumeration.\nExperimental results in several benchmark sets show that the newly proposed\nalgorithms allow finding better approximations of the Pareto frontier than\nstate-of-the-art algorithms, and with guaranteed approximation ratios.",

The objective is to devise a joint measurement and decision\nstrategy that returns a correct decision (e.g., the least loaded slice) with a\ncertain level of confidence while minimizing the measurement cost (the number\nof measurements made before committing to the decision). We study the design of\nsuch strategies for several natural admission criteria specifying what a\ncorrect decision is. For each of these criteria, using tools from best arm\nidentification in bandits, we first derive an explicit information-theoretical\nlower bound on the cost of any algorithm returning the correct decision with\nfixed confidence. We then devise a joint measurement and decision strategy\nachieving this theoretical limit. We compare empirically the measurement costs\nof these strategies, and compare them both to the lower bounds as well as a\nnaive measurement scheme.

    "abstract": "Many important decisions in daily life are made with the help of advisors,\ne.g., decisions about medical treatments or financial investments. Whereas in\nthe past, advice has often been received from human experts, friends, or\nfamily, advisors based on artificial intelligence (AI) have become more and\nmore present nowadays. Typically, the advice generated by AI is judged by a\nhuman and either deemed reliable or rejected. However, recent work has shown\nthat AI advice is not always beneficial, as humans have shown to be unable to\nignore incorrect AI advice, essentially representing an over-reliance on AI.\nTherefore, the aspired goal should be to enable humans not to rely on AI advice\nblindly but rather to distinguish its quality and act upon it to make better\ndecisions. Specifically, that means that humans should rely on the AI in the\npresence of correct advice and self-rely when confronted with incorrect advice,\ni.e., establish appropriate reliance (AR) on AI advice on a case-by-case basis.\nCurrent research lacks a metric for AR. This prevents a rigorous evaluation of\nfactors impacting AR and hinders further development of human-AI\ndecision-making. Therefore, based on the literature, we derive a measurement\nconcept of AR. We propose to view AR as a two-dimensional construct that\nmeasures the ability to discriminate advice quality and behave accordingly. In\nthis article, we derive the measurement concept, illustrate its application and\noutline potential future research.",

In recent years teaching and learning\nhave been enhanced using augmented technologies that support novices.

    "abstract": "In recent years, neural networks and especially deep architectures have\nreceived substantial attention for EEG signal analysis in the field of\nbrain-computer interfaces (BCIs). In this ongoing research area, the end-to-end\nmodels are more favoured than traditional approaches requiring signal\ntransformation pre-classification. They can eliminate the need for prior\ninformation from experts and the extraction of handcrafted features. However,\nalthough several deep learning algorithms have been already proposed in the\nliterature, achieving high accuracies for classifying motor movements or mental\ntasks, they often face a lack of interpretability and therefore are not quite\nfavoured by the neuroscience community. The reasons behind this issue can be\nthe high number of parameters and the sensitivity of deep neural networks to\ncapture tiny yet unrelated discriminative features. We propose an end-to-end\ndeep learning architecture called EEG-ITNet and a more comprehensible method to\nvisualise the network learned patterns. Using inception modules and causal\nconvolutions with dilation, our model can extract rich spectral, spatial, and\ntemporal information from multi-channel EEG signals with less complexity (in\nterms of the number of trainable parameters) than other existing end-to-end\narchitectures, such as EEG-Inception and EEG-TCNet. By an exhaustive evaluation\non dataset 2a from BCI competition IV and OpenBMI motor imagery dataset,\nEEG-ITNet shows up to 5.9\\% improvement in the classification accuracy in\ndifferent scenarios with statistical significance compared to its competitors.\nWe also comprehensively explain and support the validity of network\nillustration from a neuroscientific perspective.

Aspect\ndetection helps product owners and service providers to identify shortcomings\nand prioritize customers' needs, and hence, maintain revenues and mitigate\ncustomer churn.

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to extract\nlatent occurrences of aspects. Specifically, we assume that a customer\nundergoes a two-stage hypothetical generative process when writing a review:\n(1) deciding on an aspect amongst the set of aspects available for the product\nor service, and (2) writing the opinion words that are more interrelated to the\nchosen aspect from the set of all words available in a language.

    "abstract": "Objective: The effect of camera viewpoint was studied when performing\nvisually obstructed psychomotor targeting tasks. Background: Previous research\nin laparoscopy and robotic teleoperation found that complex perceptual-motor\nadaptations associated with misaligned viewpoints corresponded to degraded\nperformance in manipulation. Because optimal camera positioning is often\nunavailable in restricted environments, alternative viewpoints that might\nmitigate performance effects are not obvious. Methods: A virtual\nkeyboard-controlled targeting task was remotely distributed to workers of\nAmazon Mechanical Turk. The experiment was performed by 192 subjects for a\nstatic viewpoint with independent parameters of target direction, Fitts' law\nindex of difficulty, viewpoint azimuthal angle (AA), and viewpoint polar angle\n(PA). A dynamic viewpoint experiment was also performed by 112 subjects in\nwhich the viewpoint AA changed after every trial. Results: AA and target\ndirection had significant effects on performance for the static viewpoint\nexperiment. Movement time and travel distance increased while AA increased\nuntil there was a discrete improvement in performance for 180{\\deg}. Increasing\nAA from 225{\\deg} to 315{\\deg} linearly decreased movement time and distance.\nThere were significant main effects of current AA and magnitude of transition\nfor the dynamic viewpoint experiment. Orthogonal direction and no-change\nviewpoint transitions least affected performance. Conclusions: Viewpoint\nselection should aim to minimize associated rotations within the manipulation\nplane when performing targeting tasks whether implementing a static or dynamic\nviewing solution. Because PA rotations had negligible performance effects, PA\nadjustments may extend the space of viable viewpoints. Applications: These\nresults can inform viewpoint-selection for visual feedback during psychomotor\ntasks.",

    "abstract": "Given the computational cost and technical expertise required to train\nmachine learning models, users may delegate the task of learning to a service\nprovider. We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor\ninto a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves\nnormally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the\nclassification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly,\nwithout the appropriate \"backdoor key\", the mechanism is hidden and cannot be\ndetected by any computationally-bounded observer. We demonstrate two frameworks\nfor planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees.\nFirst, we show how to plant a backdoor in any model, using digital signature\nschemes. The construction guarantees that given black-box access to the\noriginal model and the backdoored version, it is computationally infeasible to\nfind even a single input where they differ. This property implies that the\nbackdoored model has generalization error comparable with the original model.\nSecond, we demonstrate how to insert undetectable backdoors in models trained\nusing the Random Fourier Features (RFF) learning paradigm or in Random ReLU\nnetworks. In this construction, undetectability holds against powerful\nwhite-box distinguishers: given a complete description of the network and the\ntraining data, no efficient distinguisher can guess whether the model is\n\"clean\" or contains a backdoor.\nOur construction of undetectable backdoors also sheds light on the related\nissue of robustness to adversarial examples. In particular, our construction\ncan produce a classifier that is indistinguishable from an \"adversarially\nrobust\" classifier, but where every input has an adversarial example! In\nsummary, the existence of undetectable backdoors represent a significant\ntheoretical roadblock to certifying adversarial robustness.",

Therefore, Hyperspectral denoising is a crucial\nstep for analyzing hyperspectral images (HSIs). Conventional computational\nmethods rarely use GPUs to improve efficiency and are not fully open-source.\nAlternatively, deep learning-based methods are often open-source and use GPUs,\nbut their training and utilization for real-world applications remain\nnon-trivial for many researchers. Consequently, we propose HyDe: the first\nopen-source, GPU-accelerated Python-based, hyperspectral image denoising\ntoolbox, which aims to provide a large set of methods with an easy-to-use\nenvironment. HyDe includes a variety of methods ranging from low-rank\nwavelet-based methods to deep neural network (DNN) models. HyDe's interface\ndramatically improves the interoperability of these methods and the performance\nof the underlying functions. In fact, these methods maintain similar HSI\ndenoising performance to their original implementations while consuming nearly\nten times less energy. Furthermore, we present a method for training DNNs for\ndenoising HSIs which are not spatially related to the training dataset, i.e.,\ntraining on ground-level HSIs for denoising HSIs with other perspectives\nincluding airborne, drone-borne, and space-borne. To utilize the trained DNNs,\nwe show a sliding window method to effectively denoise HSIs which would\notherwise require more than 40 GB.

    "abstract": "Current Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods for semantic segmentation often\nguide the student to mimic the teacher's structured information generated from\nindividual data samples. However, they ignore the global semantic relations\namong pixels across various images that are valuable for KD. This paper\nproposes a novel Cross-Image Relational KD (CIRKD), which focuses on\ntransferring structured pixel-to-pixel and pixel-to-region relations among the\nwhole images. The motivation is that a good teacher network could construct a\nwell-structured feature space in terms of global pixel dependencies. CIRKD\nmakes the student mimic better structured semantic relations from the teacher,\nthus improving the segmentation performance. Experimental results over\nCityscapes, CamVid and Pascal VOC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed approach against state-of-the-art distillation methods.

    "abstract": "A trust management system (TMS) is an integral component of any IoT network.\nA reliable trust management system must guarantee the network security, data\nintegrity, and act as a referee that promotes legitimate devices, and punishes\nany malicious activities. Trust scores assigned by TMSs reflect devices'\nreputations, which can help predict the future behaviours of network entities\nand subsequently judge the reliability of different network entities in IoT\nnetworks. Many TMSs have been proposed in the literature, these systems are\ndesigned for small-scale trust attacks, and can deal with attacks where a\nmalicious device tries to undermine TMS by spreading fake trust reports.\nHowever, these systems are prone to large-scale trust attacks. To address this\nproblem, in this paper, we propose a TMS for large-scale IoT systems called\nTrust2Vec, which can manage trust relationships in large-scale IoT systems and\ncan mitigate large-scale trust attacks that are performed by hundreds of\nmalicious devices. Trust2Vec leverages a random-walk network exploration\nalgorithm that navigates the trust relationship among devices and computes\ntrust network embeddings, which enables it to analyze the latent network\nstructure of trust relationships, even if there is no direct trust rating\nbetween two malicious devices. To detect large-scale attacks, suck as\nself-promoting and bad-mouthing, we propose a network embeddings community\ndetection algorithm that detects and blocks communities of malicious nodes. The\neffectiveness of Trust2Vec is validated through large-scale IoT network\nsimulation. The results show that Trust2Vec can achieve up to 94\\% mitigation\nrate in various network scenarios.",

Most well-developed\napproaches to remove atmospheric turbulence distortion are model-based.\nHowever, these methods require high computation and large memory preventing\ntheir feasibility of real-time operation. Deep learning-based approaches have\nhence gained more attention but currently work efficiently only on static\nscenes. This paper presents a novel learning-based framework offering short\ntemporal spanning to support dynamic scenes. We exploit complex-valued\nconvolutions as phase information, altered by atmospheric turbulence, is\ncaptured better than using ordinary real-valued convolutions. Two concatenated\nmodules are proposed. The first module aims to remove geometric distortions\nand, if enough memory, the second module is applied to refine micro details of\nthe videos.

Given an\nappropriate information model for the attacker (i.e., a specified amount of\nattacker knowledge), we provide practical relaxations on the optimal attacks to\nallow for their computation at runtime.

    "abstract": "With the spreading of hate speech on social media in recent years, automatic\ndetection of hate speech is becoming a crucial task and has attracted attention\nfrom various communities. This task aims to recognize online posts (e.g.,\ntweets) that contain hateful information. The peculiarities of languages in\nsocial media, such as short and poorly written content, lead to the difficulty\nof learning semantics and capturing discriminative features of hate speech.\nPrevious studies have utilized additional useful resources, such as sentiment\nhashtags, to improve the performance of hate speech detection. Hashtags are\nadded as input features serving either as sentiment-lexicons or extra context\ninformation. However, our close investigation shows that directly leveraging\nthese features without considering their context may introduce noise to\nclassifiers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to leverage sentiment\nhashtags to enhance hate speech detection in a natural language inference\nframework. We design a novel framework SRIC that simultaneously performs two\ntasks: (1) semantic relation inference between online posts and sentiment\nhashtags, and (2) sentiment classification on these posts. The semantic\nrelation inference aims to encourage the model to encode sentiment-indicative\ninformation into representations of online posts. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on two real-world datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed framework compared with state-of-the-art representation learning\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "In the recent years, DNA has emerged as a potentially viable storage\ntechnology. DNA synthesis, which refers to the task of writing the data into\nDNA, is perhaps the most costly part of existing storage systems. Accordingly,\nthis high cost and low throughput limits the practical use in available DNA\nsynthesis technologies. It has been found that the homopolymer run (i.e., the\nrepetition of the same nucleotide) is a major factor affecting the synthesis\nand sequencing errors. Quite recently, [26] studied the role of batch\noptimization in reducing the cost of large scale DNA synthesis, for a given\npool $\\mathcal{S}$ of random quaternary strings of fixed length. Among other\nthings, it was shown that the asymptotic cost savings of batch optimization are\nsignificantly greater when the strings in $\\mathcal{S}$ contain repeats of the\nsame character (homopolymer run of length one), as compared to the case where\nstrings are unconstrained.\nFollowing the lead of [26], in this paper, we take a step forward towards the\ntheoretical understanding of DNA synthesis, and study the homopolymer run of\nlength $k\\geq1$. Specifically, we are given a set of DNA strands $\\mathcal{S}$,\nrandomly drawn from a natural Markovian distribution modeling a general\nhomopolymer run length constraint, that we wish to synthesize. For this\nproblem, we prove that for any $k\\geq 1$, the optimal reference strand,\nminimizing the cost of DNA synthesis is, perhaps surprisingly, the periodic\nsequence $\\overline{\\mathsf{ACGT}}$. It turns out that tackling the homopolymer\nconstraint of length $k\\geq2$ is a challenging problem; our main technical\ncontribution is the representation of the DNA synthesis process as a certain\nconstrained system, for which string techniques can be applied.",

The second stage re-ranks the\ncandidate set by relying on more complex models. Recently, Siamese-BERT models\nhave been used as first stage ranker to replace or complement the traditional\nbag-of-word models. However, indexing and searching a large document collection\nrequire efficient similarity search on dense vectors and this is why ANN\ntechniques come into play. Since composite codes are naturally sparse, we first\nshow how CCSA can learn efficient parallel inverted index thanks to an\nuniformity regularizer. Second, CCSA can be used as a binary quantization\nmethod and we propose to combine it with the recent graph based ANN techniques.\nOur experiments on MSMARCO dataset reveal that CCSA outperforms IVF with\nproduct quantization. Furthermore, CCSA binary quantization is beneficial for\nthe index size, and memory usage for the graph-based HNSW method, while\nmaintaining a good level of recall and MRR. Third, we compare with recent\nsupervised quantization methods for image retrieval and find that CCSA is able\nto outperform them.",

    "abstract": "Raw deep neural network (DNN) performance is not enough; in real-world\nsettings, computational load, training efficiency and adversarial security are\njust as or even more important. We propose to simultaneously tackle\nPerformance, Efficiency, and Robustness, using our proposed algorithm Q-TART,\nQuickly Train for Adversarial Robustness and in-Transferability. Q-TART follows\nthe intuition that samples highly susceptible to noise strongly affect the\ndecision boundaries learned by DNNs, which in turn degrades their performance\nand adversarial susceptibility. By identifying and removing such samples, we\ndemonstrate improved performance and adversarial robustness while using only a\nsubset of the training data. Through our experiments we highlight Q-TART's high\nperformance across multiple Dataset-DNN combinations, including ImageNet, and\nprovide insights into the complementary behavior of Q-TART alongside existing\nadversarial training approaches to increase robustness by over 1.3% while using\nup to 17.9% less training time.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm in which\nthe server periodically aggregates local model parameters from clients without\nassembling their private data. User-constrained communication bandwidth and the\nrequirement for personalized models pose severe challenges to FL. Federated\ndistillation (FD) is proposed to simultaneously address the two problems, which\nexchanges knowledge between the server and clients, supporting heterogeneous\nlocal models while significantly reducing communication overhead. However, most\nexisting FD methods require a proxy dataset, which is often unavailable.\nProxy-data-free FD approaches eliminate the need for additional public data\nbeyond clients' private data, but suffer from remarkable discrepancy among\nlocal knowledge due to model heterogeneity, leading to ambiguous representation\non the server and inevitable accuracy degradation. To tackle this issue, we\npropose a proxy-data-free FD algorithm based on distributed knowledge\ncongruence (FedDKC). FedDKC leverages well-designed refinement strategies to\nnarrow local knowledge differences into an acceptable upper bound to mitigate\nthe negative effects of knowledge incongruence. Specifically, from perspectives\nof peak probability and Shannon entropy of local knowledge, we design\nkernel-based knowledge refinement (KKR) and searching-based knowledge\nrefinement (SKR) respectively, and theoretically guarantee the refined-local\nknowledge can satisfy an approximately-similar distribution and be regarded as\ncongruent. Extensive experiments conducted on three common datasets demonstrate\nthat our proposed FedDKC method outperforms the state-of-the-art in 93.33% of\ncomparisons, and achieves faster convergence without increasing communication\noverhead.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers the distributed robust suboptimal consensus control\nproblem of linear multi-agent systems, with both H2 and H_infty performance\nrequirements. A novel two-step complementary design approach is proposed. In\nthe first step, a distributed control law is designed for the nominal\nmulti-agent system to achieve consensus with a prescribed H2 performance. In\nthe second step, an extra control input, depending on some carefully chosen\nresidual signals indicating the modeling mismatch, is designed to complement\nthe H2 performance by providing robustness guarantee in terms of H_infty\nrequirement with respect to disturbances or uncertainties. The proposed\ncomplementary design approach provides an additional degree of freedom for\ndesign, having two separate controls to deal with the H2 performance and the\nrobustness of consensus, respectively. Thereby, it does not need to make much\ntrade-off, and can be expected to be much less conservative than the trade-off\ndesign such as the mixed H2/H_infty control method. Besides, this complementary\napproach will recover the achievable H2 performance when external disturbances\nor uncertainties do not exist. The effectiveness of the theoretical results and\nthe advantages of the complementary approach are validated via numerical\nsimulations.",

It\nplays a vital role in legal assistant systems and has become a popular research\ntopic in recent years. This paper concerns a worthwhile but not well-studied\nLJP task, Appeal judgment Prediction (AJP), which predicts the judgment of an\nappellate court on an appeal case based on the textual description of case\nfacts and grounds of appeal. There are two significant challenges in practice\nto solve the AJP task. One is how to model the appeal judgment procedure\nappropriately. The other is how to improve the interpretability of the\nprediction results. We propose a Sequential Multi-task Learning Framework with\nTask Dependency for Appeal Judgement Prediction (SMAJudge) to address these\nchallenges. SMAJudge utilizes two sequential components to model the complete\nproceeding from the lower court to the appellate court and employs an attention\nmechanism to make the prediction more explainable, which handles the challenges\nof AJP effectively. Experimental results obtained with a dataset consisting of\nmore than 30K appeal judgment documents have revealed the effectiveness and\nsuperiority of SMAJudge.",

    "title": "Machine Learning-based Anomaly Detection in Optical Fiber Monitoring",
    "abstract": "Secure and reliable data communication in optical networks is critical for\nhigh-speed Internet. However, optical fibers, serving as the data transmission\nmedium providing connectivity to billons of users worldwide, are prone to a\nvariety of anomalies resulting from hard failures (e.g., fiber cuts) and\nmalicious physical attacks (e.g., optical eavesdropping (fiber tapping)) etc.\nSuch anomalies may cause network disruption and thereby inducing huge financial\nand data losses, or compromise the confidentiality of optical networks by\ngaining unauthorized access to the carried data, or gradually degrade the\nnetwork operations. Therefore, it is highly required to implement efficient\nanomaly detection, diagnosis, and localization schemes for enhancing the\navailability and reliability of optical networks. In this paper, we propose a\ndata driven approach to accurately and quickly detect, diagnose, and localize\nfiber anomalies including fiber cuts, and optical eavesdropping attacks. The\nproposed method combines an autoencoder-based anomaly detection and an\nattention-based bidirectional gated recurrent unit algorithm, whereby the\nformer is used for fault detection and the latter is adopted for fault\ndiagnosis and localization once an anomaly is detected by the autoencoder. We\nverify the efficiency of our proposed approach by experiments under various\nanomaly scenarios using real operational data. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that: (i) the autoencoder detects any fiber fault or anomaly with\nan F1 score of 96.86%; and (ii) the attention-based bidirectional gated\nrecurrent unit algorithm identifies the the detected anomalies with an average\naccuracy of 98.2%, and localizes the faults with an average root mean square\nerror of 0.19 m.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models are mostly used in an offline inference fashion.\nHowever, this strongly limits the use of these models inside audio generation\nsetups, as most creative workflows are based on real-time digital signal\nprocessing. Although approaches based on recurrent networks can be naturally\nadapted to this buffer-based computation, the use of convolutions still poses\nsome serious challenges. To tackle this issue, the use of causal streaming\nconvolutions have been proposed. However, this requires specific complexified\ntraining and can impact the resulting audio quality.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new method allowing to produce non-causal\nstreaming models. This allows to make any convolutional model compatible with\nreal-time buffer-based processing. As our method is based on a post-training\nreconfiguration of the model, we show that it is able to transform models\ntrained without causal constraints into a streaming model. We show how our\nmethod can be adapted to fit complex architectures with parallel branches. To\nevaluate our method, we apply it on the recent RAVE model, which provides\nhigh-quality real-time audio synthesis. We test our approach on multiple music\nand speech datasets and show that it is faster than overlap-add methods, while\nhaving no impact on the generation quality. Finally, we introduce two\nopen-source implementation of our work as Max/MSP and PureData externals, and\nas a VST audio plugin.

    "abstract": "High-Order, High-Dimension, and Sparse Tensor (HOHDST) data originates from\nreal industrial applications, i.e., social networks, recommender systems,\nbio-information, and traffic information. Sparse Tensor Decomposition (STD) can\nproject the HOHDST data into low-rank space. In this work, a novel method for\nSTD of Kruskal approximating the core tensor and stochastic strategy for\napproximating the whole gradient is proposed which comprises of the following\ntwo parts: (1) the matrization unfolding order of the Kruskal product for the\ncore tensor follows the multiplication order of the factor matrix and then the\nproposed theorem can reduce the exponential computational overhead into linear\none; (2) stochastic strategy adopts one-step random sampling set, the volume of\nwhich is much smaller than original one, to approximate the whole gradient.\nMeanwhile, this method can guarantee the convergence and save the memory\noverhead. Due to the compactness of the same order matrix multiplication and\nparallel access from stochastic strategy, the speed of cuFastTucker can be\nfurther reinforced by GPU. Furthermore, %because large-scale HOHDST data cannot\nbe accommodated in a single GPU, a data division and communication strategy of\ncuFastTucker is proposed for data accommodation on Multi-GPU. cuFastTucker can\nachieve the fastest speed and keep the same accuracy and much lower memory\noverhead than the SOTA algorithms, e.g., P$-$Tucker, Vest, and SGD$\\_$Tucker.\nThe code and partial datasets are publically available on\n\"https://github.com/ZixuanLi-China/FastTucker\".",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing technology may soon deliver revolutionary improvements in\nalgorithmic performance, but these are only useful if computed answers are\ncorrect. While hardware-level decoherence errors have garnered significant\nattention, a less recognized obstacle to correctness is that of human\nprogramming errors -- \"bugs\". Techniques familiar to most programmers from the\nclassical domain for avoiding, discovering, and diagnosing bugs do not easily\ntransfer, at scale, to the quantum domain because of its unique\ncharacteristics. To address this problem, we have been working to adapt formal\nmethods to quantum programming. With such methods, a programmer writes a\nmathematical specification alongside their program, and semi-automatically\nproves the program correct with respect to it. The proof's validity is\nautomatically confirmed -- certified -- by a \"proof assistant\". Formal methods\nhave successfully yielded high-assurance classical software artifacts, and the\nunderlying technology has produced certified proofs of major mathematical\ntheorems. As a demonstration of the feasibility of applying formal methods to\nquantum programming, we present the first formally certified end-to-end\nimplementation of Shor's prime factorization algorithm, developed as part of a\nnovel framework for applying the certified approach to general applications. By\nleveraging our framework, one can significantly reduce the effects of human\nerrors and obtain a high-assurance implementation of large-scale quantum\napplications in a principled way.",

    "abstract": "Temporal modeling is crucial for video super-resolution. Most of the video\nsuper-resolution methods adopt the optical flow or deformable convolution for\nexplicitly motion compensation. However, such temporal modeling techniques\nincrease the model complexity and might fail in case of occlusion or complex\nmotion, resulting in serious distortion and artifacts. In this paper, we\npropose to explore the role of explicit temporal difference modeling in both LR\nand HR space. Instead of directly feeding consecutive frames into a VSR model,\nwe propose to compute the temporal difference between frames and divide those\npixels into two subsets according to the level of difference. They are\nseparately processed with two branches of different receptive fields in order\nto better extract complementary information. To further enhance the\nsuper-resolution result, not only spatial residual features are extracted, but\nthe difference between consecutive frames in high-frequency domain is also\ncomputed. It allows the model to exploit intermediate SR results in both future\nand past to refine the current SR output. The difference at different time\nsteps could be cached such that information from further distance in time could\nbe propagated to the current frame for refinement. Experiments on several video\nsuper-resolution benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method and its favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods.",

Thus, the performance for OLAP is crucial; however,\nit is costly to support OLAP for a large data-set. An approximate query process\n(AQP) was proposed to efficiently compute approximate values as close as to the\nexact answer. Existing AQP techniques can be categorized into two parts, online\naggregation, and offline synopsis generation, each having its limitations and\nchallenges.

    "abstract": "Recent development of neural implicit function has shown tremendous success\non high-quality 3D shape reconstruction. However, most works divide the space\ninto inside and outside of the shape, which limits their representing power to\nsingle-layer and watertight shapes. This limitation leads to tedious data\nprocessing (converting non-watertight raw data to watertight) as well as the\nincapability of representing general object shapes in the real world. In this\nwork, we propose a novel method to represent general shapes including\nnon-watertight shapes and shapes with multi-layer surfaces.

    "abstract": "The notion of experiment precision quantifies the variance of user ratings in\na subjective experiment. Although there exist measures assessing subjective\nexperiment precision, there are no systematic analyses of these measures\navailable in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, there is also no\nsystematic framework in the Multimedia Quality Assessment (MQA) field for\ncomparing subjective experiments in terms of their precision. Therefore, the\nmain idea of this paper is to propose a framework for comparing subjective\nexperiments in the field of MQA based on appropriate experiment precision\nmeasures. We put forward three experiment precision measures and three related\nexperiment precision comparison methods. We systematically analyse the\nperformance of the measures and methods proposed. We do so both through a\nstimulation study (varying user rating variance and bias) and by using data\nfrom three real-world Quality of Experience (QoE) subjective experiments. In\nthe simulation study we focus on crowdsourcing QoE experiments, since they are\nknown to generate ratings with higher variance and bias, when compared to\ntraditional subjective experiment methodologies. We conclude that our proposed\nmeasures and related comparison methods properly capture experiment precision\n(both when tested on simulated and real-world data). One of the measures also\nproves capable of dealing with even significantly biased responses. We believe\nour experiment precision assessment framework will help compare different\nsubjective experiment methodologies. For example, it may help decide which\nmethodology results in more precise user ratings. This may potentially inform\nfuture standardisation activities.",

In contrast to traditional rule-based skill routing, state-of-the-art\nsystems use a model-based approach to enable natural conversations. To provide\nsupervision signal required to train such models, ideas such as human\nannotation, replication of a rule-based system, relabeling based on user\nparaphrases, and bandit-based learning were suggested. However, these\napproaches: (a) do not scale in terms of the number of skills and skill\non-boarding, (b) require a very costly expert annotation/rule-design, (c)\nintroduce risks in the user experience with each model update. In this paper,\nwe present a scalable self-learning approach to explore routing alternatives\nwithout causing abrupt policy changes that break the user experience, learn\nfrom the user interaction, and incrementally improve the routing via frequent\nmodel refreshes. To enable such robust frequent model updates, we suggest a\nsimple and effective approach that ensures controlled policy updates for\nindividual domains, followed by an off-policy evaluation for making deployment\ndecisions without any need for lengthy A/B experimentation.

    "title": "Neighborhood Attention Transformer",
    "abstract": "We present Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), an efficient, accurate\nand scalable hierarchical transformer that works well on both image\nclassification and downstream vision tasks. It is built upon Neighborhood\nAttention (NA), a simple and flexible attention mechanism that localizes the\nreceptive field for each query to its nearest neighboring pixels. NA is a\nlocalization of self-attention, and approaches it as the receptive field size\nincreases. It is also equivalent in FLOPs and memory usage to Swin\nTransformer's shifted window attention given the same receptive field size,\nwhile being less constrained. Furthermore, NA includes local inductive biases,\nwhich eliminate the need for extra operations such as pixel shifts.\nExperimental results on NAT are competitive; NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1\naccuracy on ImageNet with only 4.3 GFLOPs and 28M parameters, 51.4% mAP on\nMS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20k.

    "title": "GelSight Fin Ray: Incorporating Tactile Sensing into a Soft Compliant  Robotic Gripper",
    "abstract": "To adapt to constantly changing environments and be safe for human\ninteraction, robots should have compliant and soft characteristics as well as\nthe ability to sense the world around them. Even so, the incorporation of\ntactile sensing into a soft compliant robot, like the Fin Ray finger, is\ndifficult due to its deformable structure. Not only does the frame need to be\nmodified to allow room for a vision sensor, which enables intricate tactile\nsensing, the robot must also retain its original mechanically compliant\nproperties. However, adding high-resolution tactile sensors to soft fingers is\ndifficult since many sensorized fingers, such as GelSight-based ones, are rigid\nand function under the assumption that changes in the sensing region are only\nfrom tactile contact and not from finger compliance. A sensorized soft robotic\nfinger needs to be able to separate its overall proprioceptive changes from its\ntactile information. To this end, this paper introduces the novel design of a\nGelSight Fin Ray, which embodies both the ability to passively adapt to any\nobject it grasps and the ability to perform high-resolution tactile\nreconstruction, object orientation estimation, and marker tracking for shear\nand torsional forces. Having these capabilities allow soft and compliant robots\nto perform more manipulation tasks that require sensing. One such task the\nfinger is able to perform successfully is a kitchen task: wine glass\nreorientation and placement, which is difficult to do with external vision\nsensors but is easy with tactile sensing. The development of this sensing\ntechnology could also potentially be applied to other soft compliant grippers,\nincreasing their viability in many different fields.",

    "abstract": "Traditional robotic manipulator design methods require extensive,\ntime-consuming, and manual trial and error to produce a viable design. During\nthis process, engineers often spend their time redesigning or reshaping\ncomponents as they discover better topologies for the robotic manipulator.\nTactile sensors, while useful, often complicate the design due to their bulky\nform factor. We propose an integrated design pipeline to streamline the design\nand manufacturing of robotic manipulators with knitted, glove-like tactile\nsensors. The proposed pipeline allows a designer to assemble a collection of\nmodular, open-source components by applying predefined graph grammar rules. The\nend result is an intuitive design paradigm that allows the creation of new\nvirtual designs of manipulators in a matter of minutes. Our framework allows\nthe designer to fine-tune the manipulator's shape through cage-based geometry\ndeformation. Finally, the designer can select surfaces for adding tactile\nsensing. Once the manipulator design is finished, the program will\nautomatically generate 3D printing and knitting files for manufacturing. We\ndemonstrate the utility of this pipeline by creating four custom manipulators\ntested on real-world tasks: screwing in a wing screw, sorting water bottles,\npicking up an egg, and cutting paper with scissors.",

In\ncontrast to prior works that typically assume known 3D templates and reduce the\nproblem to 3D pose estimation, our work reconstructs generic hand-held object\nwithout knowing their 3D templates. Our key insight is that hand articulation\nis highly predictive of the object shape, and we propose an approach that\nconditionally reconstructs the object based on the articulation and the visual\ninput. Given an image depicting a hand-held object, we first use off-the-shelf\nsystems to estimate the underlying hand pose and then infer the object shape in\na normalized hand-centric coordinate frame. We parameterized the object by\nsigned distance which are inferred by an implicit network which leverages the\ninformation from both visual feature and articulation-aware coordinates to\nprocess a query point. We perform experiments across three datasets and show\nthat our method consistently outperforms baselines and is able to reconstruct a\ndiverse set of objects.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformer (ViT) models have recently drawn much attention in\ncomputer vision due to their high model capability. However, ViT models suffer\nfrom huge number of parameters, restricting their applicability on devices with\nlimited memory. To alleviate this problem, we propose MiniViT, a new\ncompression framework, which achieves parameter reduction in vision\ntransformers while retaining the same performance. The central idea of MiniViT\nis to multiplex the weights of consecutive transformer blocks. More\nspecifically, we make the weights shared across layers, while imposing a\ntransformation on the weights to increase diversity. Weight distillation over\nself-attention is also applied to transfer knowledge from large-scale ViT\nmodels to weight-multiplexed compact models. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate the efficacy of MiniViT, showing that it can reduce the size of the\npre-trained Swin-B transformer by 48\\%, while achieving an increase of 1.0\\% in\nTop-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Moreover, using a single-layer of parameters,\nMiniViT is able to compress DeiT-B by 9.7 times from 86M to 9M parameters,\nwithout seriously compromising the performance. Finally, we verify the\ntransferability of MiniViT by reporting its performance on downstream\nbenchmarks. Code and models are available at here.",

    "title": "Any-resolution Training for High-resolution Image Synthesis",
    "abstract": "Generative models operate at fixed resolution, even though natural images\ncome in a variety of sizes. As high-resolution details are downsampled away,\nand low-resolution images are discarded altogether, precious supervision is\nlost. We argue that every pixel matters and create datasets with variable-size\nimages, collected at their native resolutions. Taking advantage of this data is\nchallenging; high-resolution processing is costly, and current architectures\ncan only process fixed-resolution data. We introduce continuous-scale training,\na process that samples patches at random scales to train a new generator with\nvariable output resolutions. First, conditioning the generator on a target\nscale allows us to generate higher resolutions images than previously possible,\nwithout adding layers to the model. Second, by conditioning on continuous\ncoordinates, we can sample patches that still obey a consistent global layout,\nwhich also allows for scalable training at higher resolutions. Controlled FFHQ\nexperiments show our method takes advantage of the multi-resolution training\ndata better than discrete multi-scale approaches, achieving better FID scores\nand cleaner high-frequency details. We also train on other natural image\ndomains including churches, mountains, and birds, and demonstrate arbitrary\nscale synthesis with both coherent global layouts and realistic local details,\ngoing beyond 2K resolution in our experiments.

It further refines the predictions by taking depth estimates into\naccount. We evaluate the proposed model on the Cityscapes and AIODrive\ndatasets.

Based on the CHM and spectral\nattributes obtained from multispectral images, we estimated and mapped the AGB\nof the region of interest with considerable cost efficiency. Our study supports\nthe development of predictive models for large-scale wall-to-wall AGB mapping\nby leveraging the complementarity between DAP and LiDAR measurements. This work\nalso reveals the potential of utilizing a UAS-based digital camera and LiDAR\nsynergistically in a plateau mountainous forest area.",

    "abstract": "Vertebral body compression fractures are early signs of osteoporosis. Though\nthese fractures are visible on Computed Tomography (CT) images, they are\nfrequently missed by radiologists in clinical settings. Prior research on\nautomatic methods of vertebral fracture classification proves its reliable\nquality; however, existing methods provide hard-to-interpret outputs and\nsometimes fail to process cases with severe abnormalities such as highly\npathological vertebrae or scoliosis. We propose a new two-step algorithm to\nlocalize the vertebral column in 3D CT images and then detect individual\nvertebrae and quantify fractures in 2D simultaneously. We train neural networks\nfor both steps using a simple 6-keypoints based annotation scheme, which\ncorresponds precisely to the current clinical recommendation. Our algorithm has\nno exclusion criteria, processes 3D CT in 2 seconds on a single GPU, and\nprovides an interpretable and verifiable output. The method approaches\nexpert-level performance and demonstrates state-of-the-art results in vertebrae\n3D localization (the average error is 1 mm), vertebrae 2D detection (precision\nand recall are 0.99), and fracture identification (ROC AUC at the patient level\nis up to 0.96). Our anchor-free vertebra detection network shows excellent\ngeneralizability on a new domain by achieving ROC AUC 0.95, sensitivity 0.85,\nspecificity 0.9 on a challenging VerSe dataset with many unseen vertebra types.",

Consequently, a long term aim is to provide a digital\nmethod of recreating physical immunohistochemical stains. Generative\nAdversarial Networks have become exceedingly advanced at mapping one image type\nto another and have shown promise at inferring immunostains from haematoxylin\nand eosin. However, they have a substantial weakness when used with pathology\nimages as they can fabricate structures that are not present in the original\ndata. CycleGANs can mitigate invented tissue structures in pathology image\nmapping but have a related disposition to generate areas of inaccurate\nstaining. In this paper, we describe a modification to the loss function of a\nCycleGAN to improve its mapping ability for pathology images by enforcing\nrealistic stain replication while retaining tissue structure. Our approach\nimproves upon others by considering structure and staining during model\ntraining. We evaluated our network using the Fr\\'echet Inception distance,\ncoupled with a new technique that we propose to appraise the accuracy of\nvirtual immunohistochemistry. This assesses the overlap between each stain\ncomponent in the inferred and ground truth images through colour deconvolution,\nthresholding and the Sorensen-Dice coefficient. Our modified loss function\nresulted in a Dice coefficient for the virtual stain of 0.78 compared with the\nreal AE1/AE3 slide. This was superior to the unaltered CycleGAN's score of\n0.74. Additionally, our loss function improved the Fr\\'echet Inception distance\nfor the reconstruction to 74.54 from 76.47. We, therefore, describe an advance\nin virtual restaining that can extend to other immunostains and tumour types\nand deliver reproducible, fast and readily accessible immunohistochemistry\nworldwide.",

Due to its fundamental\nimportance, a plethora of quantum compilers has been designed in past years.\nHowever, there are several caveats to current protocols, which are low\noptimality, high inference time, limited scalability, and lack of universality.\nTo compensate for these defects, here we devise an efficient and practical\nquantum compiler assisted by advanced deep reinforcement learning (RL)\ntechniques, i.e., data generation, deep Q-learning, and AQ* search. In this\nway, our protocol is compatible with various quantum machines and can be used\nto compile multi-qubit operators. We systematically evaluate the performance of\nour proposal in compiling quantum operators with both inverse-closed and\ninverse-free universal basis sets. In the task of single-qubit operator\ncompiling, our proposal outperforms other RL-based quantum compilers in the\nmeasure of compiling sequence length and inference time. Meanwhile, the output\nsolution is near-optimal, guaranteed by the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. Notably,\nfor the inverse-free universal basis set, the achieved sequence length\ncomplexity is comparable with the inverse-based setting and dramatically\nadvances previous methods. These empirical results contribute to improving the\ninverse-free Solovay-Kitaev theorem. In addition, for the first time, we\ndemonstrate how to leverage RL-based quantum compilers to accomplish two-qubit\noperator compiling.

Due to the diverse range\nof situations in which speech needs to be recognized, these models need to be\ngeneralizable across many acoustic conditions, speakers, and languages. This\ncontribution examines the importance of different features for speech\nrecognition predictions of plain and Lombard speech for English in comparison\nto Cantonese in stationary and modulated noise. While Cantonese is a tonal\nlanguage that encodes information in spectro-temporal features, the Lombard\neffect is known to be associated with spectral changes in the speech signal.\nThese contrasting properties of tonal languages and the Lombard effect form an\ninteresting basis for the assessment of speech recognition models. Here, an\nautomatic speech recognition-based ASR model using spectral or spectro-temporal\nfeatures is evaluated with empirical data. The results indicate that\nspectro-temporal features are crucial in order to predict the speaker-specific\nspeech recognition threshold SRT$_{50}$ in both Cantonese and English as well\nas to account for the improvement of speech recognition in modulated noise,\nwhile effects due to Lombard speech can already be predicted by spectral\nfeatures.",

The training of new sonographers and deep learning based\nalgorithms for US image analysis usually requires a large amount of data.\nHowever, obtaining and labeling large-scale US imaging data are not easy tasks,\nespecially for diseases with low incidence. Realistic US image synthesis can\nalleviate this problem to a great extent. In this paper, we propose a\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) based image synthesis framework. Our main\ncontributions include: 1) we present the first work that can synthesize\nrealistic B-mode US images with high-resolution and customized texture editing\nfeatures; 2) to enhance structural details of generated images, we propose to\nintroduce auxiliary sketch guidance into a conditional GAN. We superpose the\nedge sketch onto the object mask and use the composite mask as the network\ninput; 3) to generate high-resolution US images, we adopt a progressive\ntraining strategy to gradually generate high-resolution images from\nlow-resolution images. In addition, a feature loss is proposed to minimize the\ndifference of high-level features between the generated and real images, which\nfurther improves the quality of generated images; 4) the proposed US image\nsynthesis method is quite universal and can also be generalized to the US\nimages of other anatomical structures besides the three ones tested in our\nstudy (lung, hip joint, and ovary); 5) extensive experiments on three large US\nimage datasets are conducted to validate our method.

All subjects had their ONHs imaged in 3D\nwith Spectralis OCT. All OCT scans were automatically segmented using deep\nlearning to identify major neural and connective tissues.

We used PointNet and dynamic graph\nconvolutional neural network (DGCNN) to diagnose glaucoma from such 3D ONH\npoint clouds and to identify the critical 3D structural features of the ONH for\nglaucoma diagnosis.\nResults: Both the DGCNN (AUC: 0.97$\\pm$0.01) and PointNet (AUC:\n0.95$\\pm$0.02) were able to accurately detect glaucoma from 3D ONH point\nclouds. The critical points formed an hourglass pattern with most of them\nlocated in the inferior and superior quadrant of the ONH.\nDiscussion: The diagnostic accuracy of both geometric deep learning\napproaches was excellent. Moreover, we were able to identify the critical 3D\nstructural features of the ONH for glaucoma diagnosis that tremendously\nimproved the transparency and interpretability of our method. Consequently, our\napproach may have strong potential to be used in clinical applications for the\ndiagnosis and prognosis of a wide range of ophthalmic disorders.",

We\nrepresent the LDPC code as a cluster graph using a general purpose cluster\ngraph construction algorithm called the layered trees running intersection\nproperty (LTRIP) algorithm. The channel noise estimator is a global Gamma\ncluster, which we extend to allow for Bayesian tracking of non-stationary noise\nvariation. We evaluate our proposed model on real-world 5G drive test data. Our\nresults show that our model is capable of tracking non-stationary channel\nnoise, which outperforms an LDPC code with a fixed knowledge of the actual\naverage channel noise.",

    "abstract": "Sharing medical data between institutions is difficult in practice due to\ndata protection laws and official procedures within institutions. Therefore,\nmost existing algorithms are trained on relatively small electroencephalogram\n(EEG) data sets which is likely to be detrimental to prediction accuracy. In\nthis work, we simulate a case when the data can not be shared by splitting the\npublicly available data set into disjoint sets representing data in individual\ninstitutions. We propose to train a (local) detector in each institution and\naggregate their individual predictions into one final prediction. Four\naggregation schemes are compared, namely, the majority vote, the mean, the\nweighted mean and the Dawid-Skene method. The approach allows different\ndetector architectures amongst the institutions. The method was validated on an\nindependent data set using only a subset of EEG channels. The ensemble reaches\naccuracy comparable to a single detector trained on all the data when\nsufficient amount of data is available in each institution. The weighted mean\naggregation scheme showed best overall performance, it was only marginally\noutperformed by the Dawid-Skene method when local detectors approach\nperformance of a single detector trained on all available data.",

    "abstract": "The free metaplectic transformation (FMT) has gained much popularity in\nrecent times because of its various application in signal processing, paraxial\noptical systems, digital algorithms, optical encryption and so on. However, the\nFMT is inadequate for localized analysis of non-transient signals, as such, it\nis imperative to introduce a unique localized transform coined as the short\ntime free metaplectic transform (STFMT). In this paper, we investigate the\nSTFMT. Firstly, we propose the definition of the STFMT, and provide the time\nfrequency analysis of the proposed transform in the FMT domain. Secondly, we\ninvestigate the basic properties of the proposed transform including the\nreconstruction formula, Moyals formula. The emergence of the STFMT definition\nand its properties broadens the development of time-frequency representation of\nhigher-dimensional signals theory to a certain extent. Finally, we extend some\ndifferent uncertainty principles (UP) from quantum mechanics including Liebs,\nPitts UP, Heisenbergs uncertainty principle, Hausdorff-Young, Hardys UP,\nBeurlings UP, Logarithmic UP, and Nazarovs UP which have already been well\nstudied in the FMT domain",

    "abstract": "Mapping the connectome of the human brain using structural or functional\nconnectivity has become one of the most pervasive paradigms for neuroimaging\nanalysis. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) motivated from geometric deep\nlearning have attracted broad interest due to their established power for\nmodeling complex networked data. Despite their established performance in other\nfields, there has not yet been a systematic study of how to design effective\nGNNs for brain network analysis. To bridge this gap, we present BrainGB, a\nbenchmark for brain network analysis with GNNs. BrainGB standardizes the\nprocess by 1) summarizing brain network construction pipelines for both\nfunctional and structural neuroimaging modalities and 2) modularizing the\nimplementation of GNN designs. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets\nacross cohorts and modalities and recommend a set of general recipes for\neffective GNN designs on brain networks. To support open and reproducible\nresearch on GNN-based brain network analysis, we also host the BrainGB website\nat https:// brainnet.us/ with models, tutorials, examples, as well as an\nout-of-box Python package.

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation is still an open challenge due to the ill-posed\nnature of the problem at hand. Deep learning based techniques have been\nextensively studied and proved capable of producing acceptable depth estimation\naccuracy even if the lack of meaningful and robust depth cues within single RGB\ninput images severally limits their performance. Coded aperture-based methods\nusing phase and amplitude masks encode strong depth cues within 2D images by\nmeans of depth-dependent Point Spread Functions (PSFs) at the price of a\nreduced image quality. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end learning\napproach for depth from diffracted rotation. A phase mask that produces a\nRotating Point Spread Function (RPSF) as a function of defocus is jointly\noptimized with the weights of a depth estimation neural network. To this aim,\nwe introduce a differentiable physical model of the aperture mask and exploit\nan accurate simulation of the camera imaging pipeline. Our approach requires a\nsignificantly less complex model and less training data, yet it is superior to\nexisting methods in the task of monocular depth estimation on indoor\nbenchmarks. In addition, we address the problem of image degradation by\nincorporating a non-blind and non-uniform image deblurring module to recover\nthe sharp all-in-focus image from its RPSF-blurred counterpart.",

Common\nmethods for learning optimal DTRs, however, have shortcomings: they are\ntypically based on outcome prediction and not treatment effect estimation, or\nthey use linear models that are restrictive for patient data from modern\nelectronic health records. To address these shortcomings, we develop two novel\nmethods for learning optimal DTRs that effectively handle complex patient data.\nWe call our methods DTR-CT and DTR-CF. Our methods are based on a data-driven\nestimation of heterogeneous treatment effects using causal tree methods,\nspecifically causal trees and causal forests, that learn non-linear\nrelationships, control for time-varying confounding, are doubly robust, and\nexplainable. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first that adapts\ncausal tree methods for learning optimal DTRs. We evaluate our proposed methods\nusing synthetic data and then apply them to real-world data from intensive care\nunits. Our methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines in terms of cumulative\nregret and percentage of optimal decisions by a considerable margin.

When $\\sigma$ is the maximally mixed state\n$\\frac{1}{d} I_d$, this is known as mixedness testing. We focus on algorithms\nwhich use incoherent measurements, i.e. which only measure one copy of $\\rho$\nat a time. Unlike those that use entangled, multi-copy measurements, these can\nbe implemented without persistent quantum memory and thus represent a large\nclass of protocols that can be run on current or near-term devices.\nFor mixedness testing, there is a folklore algorithm which uses incoherent\nmeasurements and only needs $O(d^{3/2} / \\varepsilon^2)$ copies. The algorithm\nis non-adaptive, that is, its measurements are fixed ahead of time, and is\nknown to be optimal for non-adaptive algorithms. However, when the algorithm\ncan make arbitrary incoherent measurements, the best known lower bound is only\n$\\Omega (d^{4/3} / \\varepsilon^2)$ [Bubeck-Chen-Li '20], and it has been an\noutstanding open problem to close this polynomial gap.
