    "abstract": "Identifying chemical compounds is essential in several areas of science and\nengineering. Laser-based techniques are promising for autonomous compound\ndetection because the optical response of materials encodes enough electronic\nand vibrational information for remote chemical identification. This has been\nexploited using the fingerprint region of infrared absorption spectra, which\ninvolves a large number of absorption peaks that are unique to individual\nmolecules, thus facilitating chemical identification. However, optical\nidentification using visible light has not been realized. Using decades of\nexperimental refractive index data in the scientific literature of pure organic\ncompounds and polymers over a broad range of frequencies from the ultraviolet\nto the far-infrared, we develop a machine learning classifier that can\naccurately identify organic species based on a single-wavelength dispersive\nmeasurement in the visible spectral region, away from absorption resonances.\nThe optical classifier proposed here could be applied to autonomous material\nidentification protocols or applications.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of reinforcement learning for a task encoded by a reward\nmachine. The task is defined over a set of properties in the environment,\ncalled atomic propositions, and represented by Boolean variables. One\nunrealistic assumption commonly used in the literature is that the truth values\nof these propositions are accurately known. In real situations, however, these\ntruth values are uncertain since they come from sensors that suffer from\nimperfections. At the same time, reward machines can be difficult to model\nexplicitly, especially when they encode complicated tasks. We develop a\nreinforcement-learning algorithm that infers a reward machine that encodes the\nunderlying task while learning how to execute it, despite the uncertainties of\nthe propositions' truth values. In order to address such uncertainties, the\nalgorithm maintains a probabilistic estimate about the truth value of the\natomic propositions; it updates this estimate according to new sensory\nmeasurements that arrive from the exploration of the environment. Additionally,\nthe algorithm maintains a hypothesis reward machine, which acts as an estimate\nof the reward machine that encodes the task to be learned. As the agent\nexplores the environment, the algorithm updates the hypothesis reward machine\naccording to the obtained rewards and the estimate of the atomic propositions'\ntruth value. Finally, the algorithm uses a Q-learning procedure for the states\nof the hypothesis reward machine to determine the policy that accomplishes the\ntask. We prove that the algorithm successfully infers the reward machine and\nasymptotically learns a policy that accomplishes the respective task.",

    "abstract": "Neural structure search (NAS), as the mainstream approach to automate deep\nneural architecture design, has achieved much success in recent years. However,\nthe performance estimation component adhering to NAS is often prohibitively\ncostly, which leads to the enormous computational demand. Though a large number\nof efforts have been dedicated to alleviating this pain point, no consensus has\nbeen made yet on which is optimal. In this paper, we study the automated\narchitecture design from a new perspective that eliminates the need to\nsequentially evaluate each neural architecture generated during algorithm\nexecution. Specifically, the proposed approach is built by learning the\nknowledge of high-level experts in designing state-of-the-art architectures,\nand then the new architecture is directly generated upon the knowledge learned.\nWe implemented the proposed approach by using a graph neural network for link\nprediction and acquired the knowledge from NAS-Bench-101. Compared to existing\npeer competitors, we found a competitive network with minimal cost. In\naddition, we also utilized the learned knowledge from NAS-Bench-101 to automate\narchitecture design in the DARTS search space, and achieved 97.82% accuracy on\nCIFAR10, and 76.51% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet consuming only $2\\times10^{-4}$\nGPU days.

One major limitation of\ncurrent BMIs lies in the unstable performance in online control due to the\nvariability of neural signals, which seriously hinders the clinical\navailability of BMIs. Method: To deal with the neural variability in online BMI\ncontrol, we propose a dynamic ensemble Bayesian filter (DyEnsemble). DyEnsemble\nextends Bayesian filters with a dynamic measurement model, which adjusts its\nparameters in time adaptively with neural changes. This is achieved by learning\na pool of candidate functions and dynamically weighting and assembling them\naccording to neural signals. In this way, DyEnsemble copes with variability in\nsignals and improves the robustness of online control. Results: Online BMI\nexperiments with a human participant demonstrate that, compared with the\nvelocity Kalman filter, DyEnsemble significantly improves the control accuracy\n(increases the success rate by 13.9% and reduces the reach time by 13.5% in the\nrandom target pursuit task) and robustness (performs more stably over different\nexperiment days). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the superiority of\nDyEnsemble in online BMI control.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is developed to learn a single global model across\nthe decentralized data, while is susceptible when realizing client-specific\npersonalization in the presence of statistical heterogeneity. However, studies\nfocus on learning a robust global model or personalized classifiers, which\nyield divergence due to inconsistent objectives. This paper shows that it is\npossible to achieve flexible personalization after the convergence of the\nglobal model by introducing representation learning. In this paper, we first\nanalyze and determine that non-IID data harms representation learning of the\nglobal model. Existing FL methods adhere to the scheme of jointly learning\nrepresentations and classifiers, where the global model is an average of\nclassification-based local models that are consistently subject to\nheterogeneity from non-IID data. As a solution, we separate representation\nlearning from classification learning in FL and propose RepPer, an independent\ntwo-stage personalized FL framework.We first learn the client-side feature\nrepresentation models that are robust to non-IID data and aggregate them into a\nglobal common representation model. After that, we achieve personalization by\nlearning a classifier head for each client, based on the common representation\nobtained at the former stage. Notably, the proposed two-stage learning scheme\nof RepPer can be potentially used for lightweight edge computing that involves\ndevices with constrained computation power.Experiments on various datasets\n(CIFAR-10/100, CINIC-10) and heterogeneous data setup show that RepPer\noutperforms alternatives in flexibility and personalization on non-IID data.",

Linear function approximation has\ndesirable theoretical guarantees and often requires less compute and samples\nthan neural networks, but most approaches suffer from an exponential growth in\nthe number of functions as the dimensionality of the state space increases.

In real industrial\nsystems, the main challenges for the fault diagnosis of rolling bearings\npertain to the accuracy and real-time requirements. Most existing methods focus\non ensuring the accuracy, and the real-time requirement is often neglected. In\nthis paper, considering both requirements, we propose a novel fast fault\ndiagnosis method for rolling bearings, based on extreme learning machine (ELM)\nand logistic mapping, named logistic-ELM. First, we identify 14 kinds of\ntime-domain features from the original vibration signals according to\nmechanical vibration principles and adopt the sequential forward selection\n(SFS) strategy to select optimal features from them to ensure the basic\npredictive accuracy and efficiency. Next, we propose the logistic-ELM for fast\nfault classification, where the biases in ELM are omitted and the random input\nweights are replaced by the chaotic logistic mapping sequence which involves a\nhigher uncorrelation to obtain more accurate results with fewer hidden neurons.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on the rolling bearing vibration signal\ndataset of the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Data Centre.

Additionally, it enables users to employ a\nvirtual background to conceal their own environment due to privacy concerns or\nto reduce distractions, particularly in professional settings. Nevertheless, in\nscenarios where the users should not hide their actual locations, they may\nmislead other participants by claiming their virtual background as a real one.\nTherefore, it is crucial to develop tools and strategies to detect the\nauthenticity of the considered virtual background. In this paper, we present a\ndetection strategy to distinguish between real and virtual video conferencing\nuser backgrounds. We demonstrate that our detector is robust against two attack\nscenarios. The first scenario considers the case where the detector is unaware\nabout the attacks and inn the second scenario, we make the detector aware of\nthe adversarial attacks, which we refer to Adversarial Multimedia Forensics\n(i.e, the forensically-edited frames are included in the training set). Given\nthe lack of publicly available dataset of virtual and real backgrounds for\nvideo conferencing, we created our own dataset and made them publicly available\n[1]. Then, we demonstrate the robustness of our detector against different\nadversarial attacks that the adversary considers.

    "abstract": "Vessel navigation is influenced by various factors, such as dynamic\nenvironmental factors that change over time or static features such as vessel\ntype or depth of the ocean. These dynamic and static navigational factors\nimpose limitations on vessels, such as long waiting times in regions outside\nthe actual ports, and we call these waiting regions gateway ports. Identifying\ngateway ports and their associated features such as congestion and available\nutilities can enhance vessel navigation by planning on fuel optimization or\nsaving time in cargo operation. In this paper, we propose a novel temporal\ngraph neural network (TGNN) based port classification method to enable vessels\nto discover gateway ports efficiently, thus optimizing their operations. The\nproposed method processes vessel trajectory data to build dynamic graphs\ncapturing spatio-temporal dependencies between a set of static and dynamic\nnavigational features in the data, and it is evaluated in terms of port\nclassification accuracy on a real-world data set collected from ten vessels\noperating in Halifax, NS, Canada. The experimental results indicate that our\nTGNN-based port classification method provides an f-score of 95% in classifying\nports.",

    "abstract": "Steadily growing amounts of information, such as annually published\nscientific papers, have become so large that they elude an extensive manual\nanalysis. Hence, to maintain an overview, automated methods for the mapping and\nvisualization of knowledge domains are necessary and important, e.g., for\nscientific decision makers. Of particular interest in this field is the\ndevelopment of research topics of different entities (e.g., scientific authors\nand venues) over time. However, existing approaches for their analysis are only\nsuitable for single entity types, such as venues, and they often do not capture\nthe research topics or the time dimension in an easily interpretable manner.\nHence, we propose a principled approach for \\emph{mapping research\ntrajectories}, which is applicable to all kinds of scientific entities that can\nbe represented by sets of published papers. For this, we transfer ideas and\nprinciples from the geographic visualization domain, specifically trajectory\nmaps and interactive geographic maps. Our visualizations depict the research\ntopics of entities over time in a straightforward interpr. manner. They can be\nnavigated by the user intuitively and restricted to specific elements of\ninterest. The maps are derived from a corpus of research publications (i.e.,\ntitles and abstracts) through a combination of unsupervised machine learning\nmethods.\nIn a practical demonstrator application, we exemplify the proposed approach\non a publication corpus from machine learning. We observe that our trajectory\nvisualizations of 30 top machine learning venues and 1000 major authors in this\nfield are well interpretable and are consistent with background knowledge drawn\nfrom the entities' publications. Next to producing interactive, interpr.\nvisualizations supporting different kinds of analyses, our computed\ntrajectories are suitable for trajectory mining applications in the future.",

    "abstract": "Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs), one type of\ncomplex optimization problems, widely exist in various real applications.\nAlthough meta-heuristics have been successfully applied to address MOCOPs, the\ncalculation time is often much longer. Recently, a number of deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) methods have been proposed to generate approximate optimal\nsolutions to the combinatorial optimization problems. However, the existing\nstudies on DRL have seldom focused on MOCOPs. This study proposes a\nsingle-model deep reinforcement learning framework, called multi-objective\nPointer Network (MOPN), where the input structure of PN is effectively improved\nso that the single PN is capable of solving MOCOPs. In addition, two training\nstrategies, based on representative model and transfer learning, respectively,\nare proposed to further enhance the performance of MOPN in different\napplication scenarios. Moreover, compared to classical meta-heuristics, MOPN\nonly consumes much less time on forward propagation to obtain the Pareto front.\nMeanwhile, MOPN is insensitive to problem scale, meaning that a trained MOPN is\nable to address MOCOPs with different scales. To verify the performance of\nMOPN, extensive experiments are conducted on three multi-objective traveling\nsalesman problems, in comparison with one state-of-the-art model DRL-MOA and\nthree classical multi-objective meta-heuristics. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed model outperforms all the comparative methods\nwith only 20\\% to 40\\% training time of DRL-MOA.",

    "abstract": "The future sixth generation (6G) of communication systems is envisioned to\nprovide numerous applications in safety-critical contexts, e.g., driverless\ntraffic, modular industry, and smart cities, which require outstanding\nperformance, high reliability and fault tolerance, as well as autonomy.\nEnsuring criticality awareness for diverse functional safety applications and\nproviding fault tolerance in an autonomous manner are essential for future 6G\nsystems. Therefore, this paper proposes jointly employing the concepts of\nresilience and mixed criticality. In this contribution, we conduct physical\nlayer resource management in cloud-based networks under the rate-splitting\nparadigm, which is a promising factor towards achieving high resilience. We\nrecapitulate the concepts individually, outline a joint metric to measure the\ncriticality-aware resilience, and verify its merits in a case study. We,\nthereby, formulate a non-convex optimization problem, derive an efficient\niterative algorithm, propose four resilience mechanisms differing in quality\nand time of adaption, and conduct numerical simulations. Towards this end, a\nhighly autonomous rate-splitting-enabled physical layer resource management\nalgorithm for future 6G networks respecting mixed-critical QoS levels and\nproviding high levels of resilience is proposed. Results emphasize the\nappreciable improvements of implementing mixed criticality-aware resilience\nunder channel outages and strict quality of service (QoS) demands. The\nrate-splitting paradigm is particularly shown to overcome state-of-the-art\ninterference management techniques, and the resilience and throughput adaption\nover consecutive outage events reveals the proposed schemes suitability for\nfuture 6G networks.",

    "abstract": "Using synthetic data for training neural networks that achieve good\nperformance on real-world data is an important task as it has the potential to\nreduce the need for costly data annotation. Yet, a network that is trained on\nsynthetic data alone does not perform well on real data due to the domain gap\nbetween the two. Reducing this gap, also known as domain adaptation, has been\nwidely studied in recent years. In the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)\nframework, unlabeled real data is used during training with labeled synthetic\ndata to obtain a neural network that performs well on real data. In this work,\nwe focus on image data. For the semantic segmentation task, it has been shown\nthat performing image-to-image translation from source to target, and then\ntraining a network for segmentation on source annotations - leads to poor\nresults. Therefore a joint training of both is essential, which has been a\ncommon practice in many techniques. Yet, closing the large domain gap between\nthe source and the target by directly performing the adaptation between the two\nis challenging. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage framework for\nimproving domain adaptation techniques. In the first step, we progressively\ntrain a multi-scale neural network to perform an initial transfer between the\nsource data to the target data. We denote the new transformed data as \"Source\nin Target\" (SiT). Then, we use the generated SiT data as the input to any\nstandard UDA approach. This new data has a reduced domain gap from the desired\ntarget domain, and the applied UDA approach further closes the gap. We\ndemonstrate the improvement achieved by our framework with two state-of-the-art\nmethods for semantic segmentation, DAFormer and ProDA, on two UDA tasks, GTA5\nto Cityscapes and Synthia to Cityscapes.

We show that, for many learning processes, the\nstudent's learnable parameters form a Markov state. To avoid having the teacher\nlearn directly from parameters, we propose the Parameter Embedder that learns a\nrepresentation of a student's state from its input/output behaviour. Next, we\nuse learning progress to shape the teacher's reward towards maximizing the\nstudent's performance. To demonstrate the generality of Reinforcement Teaching,\nwe conducted experiments in which a teacher learns to significantly improve\nsupervised and reinforcement learners by using a combination of learning\nprogress reward and a Parameter Embedded state. These results show that\nReinforcement Teaching is not only an expressive framework capable of unifying\ndifferent approaches, but also provides meta-learning with the plethora of\ntools from reinforcement learning.",

    "abstract": "Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is attracting an ever-growing attention and\nmore than ever it has found many application areas for many challenging\noptimization problems. It is, however, a known fact that PSO has a severe\ndrawback in the update of its global best (gbest) particle, which has a crucial\nrole of guiding the rest of the swarm. In this paper, we propose three\nefficient solutions to remedy this problem using the SPSA Algorithm. In the\nfirst approach, gbest is updated with respect to a global estimation of the\ngradient and can avoid getting trapped into a local optimum. The second\napproach is based on the formation of an alternative or artificial global best\nparticle, the so-called aGB, which can replace the native gbest particle for a\nbetter guidance, the decision of which is held by a fair competition between\nthe two. The third approach is based on the update of the swarm particle. For\nthis purpose we use simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA)\nfor its low cost. Since SPSA is applied only to the gbest (not to the entire\nswarm) or to the entire swarm, both approaches result thus in a negligible\noverhead cost for the entire PSO process. Both approaches are shown to\nsignificantly improve the performance of PSO over a wide range of non-linear\nfunctions, especially if SPSA and PSO parameters are well selected to fit the\nproblem at hand.

Existing learning-based methods\nrely heavily on expensive point-wise annotations. To alleviate this problem, we\nare the first to explore a low-cost annotation way for 3D tooth instance\nsegmentation, i.e., labeling all tooth centroids and only a few teeth for each\ndental model. Regarding the challenge when only weak annotation is provided, we\npresent a dental arch prior-assisted 3D tooth segmentation method, namely\nDArch. Our DArch consists of two stages, including tooth centroid detection and\ntooth instance segmentation. Accurately detecting the tooth centroids can help\nlocate the individual tooth, thus benefiting the segmentation. Thus, our DArch\nproposes to leverage the dental arch prior to assist the detection.\nSpecifically, we firstly propose a coarse-to-fine method to estimate the dental\narch, in which the dental arch is initially generated by Bezier curve\nregression, and then a graph-based convolutional network (GCN) is trained to\nrefine it. With the estimated dental arch, we then propose a novel Arch-aware\nPoint Sampling (APS) method to assist the tooth centroid proposal generation.\nMeantime, a segmentor is independently trained using a patch-based training\nstrategy, aiming to segment a tooth instance from a 3D patch centered at the\ntooth centroid.

In\nthis paper we present a novel NLP pipeline for generating and visualizing trace\nlink explanations. Our approach identifies domain-specific concepts, retrieves\na corpus of concept-related sentences, mines concept definitions and usage\nexamples, and identifies relations between cross-artifact concepts in order to\nexplain the links. It applies a post-processing step to prioritize the most\nlikely acronyms and definitions and to eliminate non-relevant ones. We evaluate\nour approach using project artifacts from three different domains of\ninterstellar telescopes, positive train control, and electronic health-care\nsystems, and then report coverage, correctness, and potential utility of the\ngenerated definitions. We design and utilize an explanation interface which\nleverages concept definitions and relations to visualize and explain trace link\nrationales, and we report results from a user study that was conducted to\nevaluate the effectiveness of the explanation interface.

    "title": "Quo Vadis, Optical Network Architecture? Towards an  Optical-processing-enabled Paradigm",
    "abstract": "Among various aspects in optical network architectures, handling transit\ntraffic at intermediate nodes represents a defining characteristic for\nclassification. In this context, the transition from the first generation of\noptical-electrical-optical (O-E-O) mode to the second generation of\noptical-bypass marked a paradigm shift in redesigning optical transport\nnetworks towards greater network efficiency. Optical-bypass operation has then\nbecome the \\textit{de facto} approach adopted by the majority of carriers in\nboth metro and backbone networks in the last two decades and has remained\nbasically unchanged. However, in optical-bypass network, the fact that\nin-transit lightpaths crossing a common intermediate node must be separated in\neither time, frequency or spatial domain to avoid adversarial interference\nappears to be a critical shortcoming as the interaction of such lightpaths in\noptical domain may result in efficient computing and/or signal processing\noperations for saving spectral resources. Inspired by the accelerated\nprogresses in optical signal processing technologies and the integration of\ncomputing and communications, we introduce in this paper a new architectural\nparadigm for future optical networks and highlight how this new architecture\nhas the potential to shatter the \\textit{status quo}. Indeed, our proposal is\ncentered on exploiting the superposition of in-transit lightpaths at\nintermediate nodes to generate more spectrally efficient lightpaths and how to\nharness this opportunity from network design perspectives. We present two case\nstudies featuring optical aggregation and optical XOR encoding to demonstrate\nthe merit of optical-processing-enabled operation compared to its counterpart,\noptical-bypass. Numerical results on realistic network typologies are provided,\nrevealing that a spectral saving up to $30\\%$ could be achieved thanks to\nadopting optical-processing network.",

Although it is impressive, the size of\nlanguage models can be prohibitive to make them usable in on-device\napplications, such as sensors or smartphones. With smaller language models,\ntask-specific data annotation is needed to fine-tune the language model for a\nspecific purpose. However, data annotation can have a substantial financial and\ntime burden for small research groups, startups, and even companies. In this\npaper, we analyze different prompt-based fine-tuning techniques to improve\nresults on both language and multimodal causal transformer models. To evaluate\nour results, we use a dataset focusing on visual commonsense reasoning in time.\nOur results show that by simple model-agnostic prompt-based fine-tuning,\ncomparable results can be reached by only using 35%-40% of the fine-tuning\ntraining dataset. The proposed approaches result in significant time and\nfinancial savings. As the proposed methods make minimal architectural\nassumptions, other researchers can use the results in their transformer models\nwith minimal adaptations.

Our approach uses fractional coloring for a\nb-fold coloring of characteristic graphs to provide a linear programming\nrelaxation to the traditional coloring method and achieves coding at a\nfine-grained granularity. We derive the fundamental lower bound for\ncompression, given by the fractional characteristic graph entropy, through\ngeneralizing the notion of K\\\"orner's graph entropy. We demonstrate the coding\ngains of fractional coloring over traditional coloring via a computation\nexample. We conjecture that the integrality gap between fractional coloring and\ntraditional coloring approaches the smallest b that attains the fractional\nchromatic number to losslessly represent the independent sets for a given\ncharacteristic graph, up to a linear scaling which is a function of the\nfractional chromatic number.",

While there are openly available tools providing flexible and\neasy-to-use interfaces for specifying and solving optimization problems\nformulated in terms of either discrete or continuous graphical models, at\npresent, no similarly general tools exist enabling the same functionality for\nhybrid discrete-continuous problems. We aim to address this problem. In\nparticular, we provide a library, DC-SAM, extending existing tools for\noptimization problems defined in terms of factor graphs to the setting of\ndiscrete-continuous models. A key contribution of our work is a novel solver\nfor efficiently recovering approximate solutions to discrete-continuous\noptimization problems. The key insight to our approach is that while joint\ninference over continuous and discrete state spaces is often hard, many\ncommonly encountered discrete-continuous problems can naturally be split into a\n\"discrete part\" and a \"continuous part\" that can individually be solved easily.\nLeveraging this structure, we optimize discrete and continuous variables in an\nalternating fashion. In consequence, our proposed work enables straightforward\nrepresentation of and approximate inference in discrete-continuous graphical\nmodels. We also provide a method to recover the uncertainty in estimates of\nboth discrete and continuous variables.

Due to the presence of the static background,\na video can be naturally decomposed into a low-rank background and a sparse\nforeground. Many regularization techniques, such as matrix nuclear norm, have\nbeen imposed on the background. In the meanwhile, sparsity or smoothness based\nregularizations, such as total variation and $\\ell_1$, can be imposed on the\nforeground. Moreover, graph Laplacians are further imposed to capture the\ncomplicated geometry of background images. Recently, weighted regularization\ntechniques including the weighted nuclear norm regularization have been\nproposed in the image processing community to promote adaptive sparsity while\nachieving efficient performance. In this paper, we propose a robust dual-graph\nregularized moving object detection model based on the weighted nuclear norm\nregularization, which is solved by the alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM).

    "abstract": "Adaptive filtering algorithms are pervasive throughout modern society and\nhave had a significant impact on a wide variety of domains including audio\nprocessing, telecommunications, biomedical sensing, astropyhysics and\ncosmology, seismology, and many more. Adaptive filters typically operate via\nspecialized online, iterative optimization methods such as least-mean squares\nor recursive least squares and aim to process signals in unknown or\nnonstationary environments. Such algorithms, however, can be slow and laborious\nto develop, require domain expertise to create, and necessitate mathematical\ninsight for improvement. In this work, we seek to go beyond the limits of\nhuman-derived adaptive filter algorithms and present a comprehensive framework\nfor learning online, adaptive signal processing algorithms or update rules\ndirectly from data. To do so, we frame the development of adaptive filters as a\nmeta-learning problem in the context of deep learning and use a form of\nself-supervision to learn online iterative update rules for adaptive filters.\nTo demonstrate our approach, we focus on audio applications and systematically\ndevelop meta-learned adaptive filters for five canonical audio problems\nincluding system identification, acoustic echo cancellation, blind\nequalization, multi-channel dereverberation, and beamforming. For each\napplication, we compare against common baselines and/or current\nstate-of-the-art methods and show we can learn high-performing adaptive filters\nthat operate in real-time and, in most cases, significantly out perform all\npast specially developed methods for each task using a single general-purpose\nconfiguration of our method.",

In order to examine security vulnerabilities and prevent the\nleakage of sensitive data in a timely manner, the database logging system\nusually employs an online signaling scheme to issue an alert when suspicious\naccess is detected. Defenders can audit alerts to reduce potential damage. This\ninteraction process between a defender and an attacker can be modeled as an\naudit game. In previous studies, it was found that sending real-time signals in\nthe audit game to warn visitors can improve the benefits of the defender.\nHowever, the previous approaches usually assume perfect information of the\nattacker, or simply concentrate on the utility of the defender. In this paper,\nwe introduce a brand-new zero-determinant (ZD) strategy to study the sequential\naudit game with online signaling, which empowers the defender to unilaterally\ncontrol the utility of visitors when accessing sensitive data. In addition, an\noptimization scheme based on the ZD strategy is designed to effectively\nmaximize the utility difference between the defender and the attacker.\nExtensive simulation results show that our proposed scheme enhances the\nsecurity management and control capabilities of the defender to better handle\ndifferent access requests and safeguard the system security in a cost-efficient\nmanner.",

Therefore, the\ncharacteristics of bugs in quantum software projects may be very different from\nthat of classical software projects. This work aims to understand the\ncharacteristics of bugs in quantum software projects, in order to provide\ninsights to help devise effective testing and debugging mechanisms. To achieve\nthis goal, we conduct an empirical study on the bug reports of 125 quantum\nsoftware projects. We observe that quantum software projects are more buggy\nthan classical software projects and that quantum project bugs are more costly\nto fix than classical project bugs. We also identify the types of the bugs and\nthe quantum programming components where they occurred. Our study shows that\nthe bugs are spread across different components, but quantum-specific bugs\nparticularly appear in the compiler, gate operation, and state preparation\ncomponents. The three most occurring types of bugs are Program anomaly bugs,\nConfiguration bugs, and Data type and structure bugs. Our study highlights some\nparticularly challenging areas in quantum software development, such as the\nlack of scientific quantum computation libraries that implement comprehensive\nmathematical functions for quantum computing.

    "abstract": "The content that a recommender system (RS) shows to users influences them.\nTherefore, when choosing which recommender to deploy, one is implicitly also\nchoosing to induce specific internal states in users. Even more, systems\ntrained via long-horizon optimization will have direct incentives to manipulate\nusers, e.g. shift their preferences so they are easier to satisfy. In this work\nwe focus on induced preference shifts in users. We argue that - before\ndeployment - system designers should: estimate the shifts a recommender would\ninduce; evaluate whether such shifts would be undesirable; and even actively\noptimize to avoid problematic shifts. These steps involve two challenging\ningredients: estimation requires anticipating how hypothetical policies would\ninfluence user preferences if deployed - we do this by using historical user\ninteraction data to train predictive user model which implicitly contains their\npreference dynamics; evaluation and optimization additionally require metrics\nto assess whether such influences are manipulative or otherwise unwanted - we\nuse the notion of \"safe shifts\", that define a trust region within which\nbehavior is safe. In simulated experiments, we show that our learned preference\ndynamics model is effective in estimating user preferences and how they would\nrespond to new recommenders. Additionally, we show that recommenders that\noptimize for staying in the trust region can avoid manipulative behaviors while\nstill generating engagement.",

    "abstract": "Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) can be divided into two major categories:\noffline VRPs, which consider a given set of trip requests to be served, and\nonline VRPs, which consider requests as they arrive in real-time. Based on\ndiscussions with public transit agencies, we identify a real-world problem that\nis not addressed by existing formulations: booking trips with flexible pickup\nwindows (e.g., 3 hours) in advance (e.g., the day before) and confirming tight\npickup windows (e.g., 30 minutes) at the time of booking. Such a service model\nis often required in paratransit service settings, where passengers typically\nbook trips for the next day over the phone. To address this gap between offline\nand online problems, we introduce a novel formulation, the offline vehicle\nrouting problem with online bookings. This problem is very challenging\ncomputationally since it faces the complexity of considering large sets of\nrequests -- similar to offline VRPs -- but must abide by strict constraints on\nrunning time -- similar to online VRPs. To solve this problem, we propose a\nnovel computational approach, which combines an anytime algorithm with a\nlearning-based policy for real-time decisions. Based on a paratransit dataset\nobtained from our partner transit agency, we demonstrate that our novel\nformulation and computational approach lead to significantly better outcomes in\nthis service setting than existing algorithms.",

This\npaper aims to significantly reduce training costs with effective use of\npreemptible instances, i.e., those that can be obtained at a much cheaper price\nwhile idle, but may be preempted whenever requested by priority users. Doing\nso, however, requires new forms of resiliency and efficiency to cope with the\npossibility of frequent preemptions - a failure model that is drastically\ndifferent from the occasional failures in normal cluster settings that existing\ncheckpointing techniques target.\nWe present Bamboo, a distributed system that tackles these challenges by\nintroducing redundant computations into the training pipeline, i.e., whereby\none node performs computations over not only its own layers but also over some\nlayers in its neighbor. Our key insight is that training large models often\nrequires pipeline parallelism where \"pipeline bubbles\" naturally exist. Bamboo\ncarefully fills redundant computations into these bubbles, providing resilience\nat a low cost. Across a variety of widely used DNN models, Bamboo outperforms\ntraditional checkpointing by 3.7x in training throughput, and reduces costs by\n2.4x compared to a setting where on-demand instances are used.",

    "abstract": "The surging demand for fresh information from various Internet of Things\n(IoT) applications requires oceans of data to be transmitted and processed\ntimely. How to guarantee information freshness while reducing energy\nconsumption thus becomes imperative. We consider a multi-source single-server\nqueueing system, where we aim to design the optimal sleep-wake strategy for the\nserver to reduce its energy consumption while guaranteeing users' information\nfreshness. We propose a sleep-wake strategy that relies on an idling scheme\ncalled Conditional Sleep (CS) scheme. We show that the proposed CS scheme can\nachieve a smaller Age of Information (AoI) than the widely-used Hysteresis Time\n(HT) scheme and Bernoulli Sleep (BS) scheme, while retaining the same power\nconsumption and Peak Age of Information (PAoI). Moreover, we find that\nincreasing the sleep period length can always reduce energy consumption and\nenlarge the PAoI, but it does not always increase AoI. We also find that using\nPAoI as the information freshness metric in designing the optimal sleep-wake\nstrategies would make the server sleep infinitely long. Our analysis reveals\nthat this result is due to the PAoI being a first-order statistic. We further\nextend our discussion to the scenario where data sources choose sampling rates\nstrategically based on the sleep-wake strategy of the server. We show that\nincreasing the sleeping period length for the server while guaranteeing users'\nPAoI could lead to a minor reduction of the server's energy consumption but\nsignificantly increase the data sources' sampling costs.",

Data augmentation, explored as an effective approach to tackle them,\ncan improve the robustness and efficiency of classification models by\ngenerating new samples. This paper presents REPRINT, a simple and effective\nhidden-space data augmentation method for imbalanced data classification. Given\nhidden-space representations of samples in each class, REPRINT extrapolates, in\na randomized fashion, augmented examples for target class by using subspaces\nspanned by principal components to summarize distribution structure of both\nsource and target class. Consequently, the examples generated would diversify\nthe target while maintaining the original geometry of target distribution.\nBesides, this method involves a label refinement component which allows to\nsynthesize new soft labels for augmented examples. Compared with different NLP\ndata augmentation approaches under a range of data imbalanced scenarios on four\ntext classification benchmark, REPRINT shows prominent improvements. Moreover,\nthrough comprehensive ablation studies, we show that label refinement is better\nthan label-preserving for augmented examples, and that our method suggests\nstable and consistent improvements in terms of suitable choices of principal\ncomponents. Moreover, REPRINT is appealing for its easy-to-use since it\ncontains only one hyperparameter determining the dimension of subspace and\nrequires low computational resource.",

    "abstract": "The problem of offline reinforcement learning focuses on learning a good\npolicy from a log of environment interactions. Past efforts for developing\nalgorithms in this area have revolved around introducing constraints to online\nreinforcement learning algorithms to ensure the actions of the learned policy\nare constrained to the logged data. In this work, we explore an alternative\napproach by planning on the fixed dataset directly. Specifically, we introduce\nan algorithm which forms a tabular Markov Decision Process (MDP) over the\nlogged data by adding new transitions to the dataset. We do this by using\nlearned dynamics models to plan short trajectories between states. Since exact\nvalue iteration can be performed on this constructed MDP, it becomes easy to\nidentify which trajectories are advantageous to add to the MDP. Crucially,\nsince most transitions in this MDP come from the logged data, trajectories from\nthe MDP can be rolled out for long periods with confidence. We prove that this\nproperty allows one to make upper and lower bounds on the value function up to\nappropriate distance metrics. Finally, we demonstrate empirically how\nalgorithms that uniformly constrain the learned policy to the entire dataset\ncan result in unwanted behavior, and we show an example in which simply\nbehavior cloning the optimal policy of the MDP created by our algorithm avoids\nthis problem.",

Due to the emergence\nof huge amounts of multi-modal heterogeneous spatial/temporal/spatial-temporal\ndata in big data era, the existing visual methods rely heavily on large-scale\ndata annotations and supervised learning to learn a powerful big model.\nHowever, the lack of interpretability, robustness, and out-of-distribution\ngeneralization are becoming the bottleneck problems of these models, which\nhinders the progress of interpretable and reliable artificial intelligence. The\nmajority of the existing methods are based on correlation learning with the\nassumption that the data are independent and identically distributed, which\nlack an unified guidance and analysis about why modern spatial-temporal\nrepresentation learning methods have limited interpretability and easily\ncollapse into dataset bias.

To address this, we formally define fairness notions for\nparticipants and speakers, and derive suitable objectives to account for them.\nAs the efficiency and fairness objectives can be in conflict with each other,\nwe propose a joint optimization framework that allows conference organizers to\ndesign schedules that balance (i.e., allow trade-offs) among efficiency,\nparticipant fairness and speaker fairness objectives. While the optimization\nproblem can be solved using integer programming to schedule smaller\nconferences, we provide two scalable techniques to cater to bigger conferences.\nExtensive evaluations over multiple real-world datasets show the efficacy and\nflexibility of our proposed approaches.",

    "abstract": "Most modern recommender systems predict users preferences with two\ncomponents: user and item embedding learning, followed by the user-item\ninteraction modeling. By utilizing the auxiliary review information accompanied\nwith user ratings, many of the existing review-based recommendation models\nenriched user/item embedding learning ability with historical reviews or better\nmodeled user-item interactions with the help of available user-item target\nreviews. Though significant progress has been made, we argue that current\nsolutions for review-based recommendation suffer from two drawbacks. First, as\nreview-based recommendation can be naturally formed as a user-item bipartite\ngraph with edge features from corresponding user-item reviews, how to better\nexploit this unique graph structure for recommendation? Second, while most\ncurrent models suffer from limited user behaviors, can we exploit the unique\nself-supervised signals in the review-aware graph to guide two recommendation\ncomponents better? To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Review-aware\nGraph Contrastive Learning (RGCL) framework for review-based recommendation.\nSpecifically, we first construct a review-aware user-item graph with\nfeature-enhanced edges from reviews, where each edge feature is composed of\nboth the user-item rating and the corresponding review semantics. This graph\nwith feature-enhanced edges can help attentively learn each neighbor node\nweight for user and item representation learning. After that, we design two\nadditional contrastive learning tasks (i.e., Node Discrimination and Edge\nDiscrimination) to provide self-supervised signals for the two components in\nrecommendation process. Finally, extensive experiments over five benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed RGCL compared to the\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been introduced in communication networks\nand services to improve efficiency via self-optimization. Cooperative\nintelligence (CI), also known as collective intelligence and collaborative\nintelligence, is expected to become an integral element in next-generation\nnetworks because it can aggregate the capabilities and intelligence of multiple\ndevices. However, privacy issues may intimidate, obstruct, and hinder the\ndeployment of CI in practice because collaboration heavily relies on data and\ninformation sharing. Additional practical constraints in communication (e.g.,\nlimited bandwidth) further limit the performance of CI. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose PP-MARL, an efficient privacy-preserving learning scheme\nbased on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We apply and evaluate our\nscheme in two communication-related use cases: mobility management in\ndrone-assisted communication and network control with edge intelligence.\nSimulation results reveal that the proposed scheme can achieve efficient and\nreliable collaboration with 1.1-6 times better privacy protection and lower\noverheads (e.g., 84-91% reduction in bandwidth) than state-of-the-art\napproaches.",

    "abstract": "An avatar mirroring the user's movement is commonly adopted in Virtual\nReality(VR). Maintaining the user-avatar movement consistency provides the user\na sense of body ownership and thus an immersive experience. However, breaking\nthis consistency can enable new interaction functionalities, such as pseudo\nhaptic feedback or input augmentation, at the expense of immersion. We propose\nto quantify the probability of users noticing the movement inconsistency while\nthe inconsistency amplitude is being enlarged, which aims to guide the\nintervention of the users' sense of body ownership in VR. We applied angular\noffsets to the avatar's shoulder and elbow joints and recorded whether the user\nidentified the inconsistency through a series of three user studies and built a\nstatistical model based on the results. Results show that the noticeability of\nmovement inconsistency increases roughly quadratically with the enlargement of\noffsets and the offsets at two joints negatively affect the probability\ndistributions of each other. Leveraging the model, we implemented a technique\nthat amplifies the user's arm movements with unnoticeable offsets and then\nevaluated implementations with different parameters(offset strength, offset\ndistribution). Results show that the technique with medium-level and\nbalanced-distributed offsets achieves the best overall performance. Finally, we\ndemonstrated our model's extendability in interventions in the sense of body\nownership with three VR applications including stroke rehabilitation, action\ngame and widget arrangement.",

    "abstract": "Learning often involves interaction between multiple agents. Human\nteacher-student settings best illustrate how interactions result in efficient\nknowledge passing where the teacher constructs a curriculum based on their\nstudents' abilities. Prior work in machine teaching studies how the teacher\nshould construct optimal teaching datasets assuming the teacher knows\neverything about the student. However, in the real world, the teacher doesn't\nhave complete information about the student. The teacher must interact and\ndiagnose the student, before teaching. Our work proposes a simple diagnosis\nalgorithm which uses Gaussian processes for inferring student-related\ninformation, before constructing a teaching dataset. We apply this to two\nsettings. One is where the student learns from scratch and the teacher must\nfigure out the student's learning algorithm parameters, eg. the regularization\nparameters in ridge regression or support vector machines. Two is where the\nstudent has partially explored the environment and the teacher must figure out\nthe important areas the student has not explored; we study this in the offline\nreinforcement learning setting where the teacher must provide demonstrations to\nthe student and avoid sending redundant trajectories. Our experiments highlight\nthe importance of diagosing before teaching and demonstrate how students can\nlearn more efficiently with the help of an interactive teacher. We conclude by\noutlining where diagnosing combined with teaching would be more desirable than\npassive learning.",

It has information for 200 countries and is\none of the biggest databases for political science. According to the V-Dem\nannual democracy report 2019, Taiwan is one of the two countries that got\ndisseminated false information from foreign governments the most. It also shows\nthat the \"made-up news\" has caused a great deal of confusion in Taiwanese\nsociety and has serious impacts on global stability. Although there are several\napplications helping distinguish the false information, we found out that the\npre-processing of categorizing the news is still done by human labor. However,\nhuman labor may cause mistakes and cannot work for a long time. The growing\ndemands for automatic machines in the near decades show that while the machine\ncan do as good as humans or even better, using machines can reduce humans'\nburden and cut down costs. Therefore, in this work, we build a predictive model\nto classify the category of news. The corpora we used contains 28358 news and\n200 news scraped from the online newspaper Liberty Times Net (LTN) website and\nincludes 8 categories: Technology, Entertainment, Fashion, Politics, Sports,\nInternational, Finance, and Health. At first, we use Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) for word embeddings which transform\neach Chinese character into a (1,768) vector. Then, we use a Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) layer to transform word embeddings into sentence embeddings and\nadd another LSTM layer to transform them into document embeddings. Each\ndocument embedding is an input for the final predicting model, which contains\ntwo Dense layers and one Activation layer.

    "abstract": "It is a challenging task to recover all-in-focus image from a single defocus\nblurry image in real-world applications. On many modern cameras, dual-pixel\n(DP) sensors create two-image views, based on which stereo information can be\nexploited to benefit defocus deblurring. Despite existing DP defocus deblurring\nmethods achieving impressive results, they directly take naive concatenation of\nDP views as input, while neglecting the disparity between left and right views\nin the regions out of camera's depth of field (DoF). In this work, we propose a\nDual-Pixel Alignment Network (DPANet) for defocus deblurring. Generally, DPANet\nis an encoder-decoder with skip-connections, where two branches with shared\nparameters in the encoder are employed to extract and align deep features from\nleft and right views, and one decoder is adopted to fuse aligned features for\npredicting the all-in-focus image. Due to that DP views suffer from different\nblur amounts, it is not trivial to align left and right views. To this end, we\npropose novel encoder alignment module (EAM) and decoder alignment module\n(DAM). In particular, a correlation layer is suggested in EAM to measure the\ndisparity between DP views, whose deep features can then be accordingly aligned\nusing deformable convolutions. And DAM can further enhance the alignment of\nskip-connected features from encoder and deep features in decoder. By\nintroducing several EAMs and DAMs, DP views in DPANet can be well aligned for\nbetter predicting latent all-in-focus image. Experimental results on real-world\ndatasets show that our DPANet is notably superior to state-of-the-art\ndeblurring methods in reducing defocus blur while recovering visually plausible\nsharp structures and textures.",

First, we propose a new Lie group with\nits algebra, based on which a novel invariant extended Kalman filter (invariant\nEKF) is designed. We theoretically prove that, when we do not consider the\nuncertainty of the map information, the proposed invariant EKF can naturally\nmaintain the correct observability properties of the system. To consider the\nuncertainty of the map information, we introduce a Schmidt filter. With the\nSchmidt filter, the uncertainty of the map information can be taken into\nconsideration to avoid over-confident estimation while the computation cost\nonly increases linearly with the size of the map keyframes. In addition, we\nintroduce an easily implemented observability-constrained technique because\ndirectly combining the invariant EKF with the Schmidt filter cannot maintain\nthe correct observability properties of the system that considers the\nuncertainty of the map information. Finally, we validate our proposed system's\nhigh consistency, accuracy, and efficiency via extensive simulations and\nreal-world experiments.",

There are typically two\nkinds of existing methods: one-stage methods that directly perform segmentation\non the fused vision and language features; and two-stage methods that first\nutilize an instance segmentation model for instance proposal and then select\none of these instances via matching them with language features. In this work,\nwe propose a novel framework that simultaneously detects the target-of-interest\nvia feature propagation and generates a fine-grained segmentation mask. In our\nframework, each instance is represented by an Instance-Specific Feature (ISF),\nand the target-of-referring is identified by exchanging information among all\nISFs using our proposed Feature Propagation Module (FPM). Our instance-aware\napproach learns the relationship among all objects, which helps to better\nlocate the target-of-interest than one-stage methods.

To further\nimprove the parallelism of SC decoding, this paper present a new class of\nspecial node composed of a sequence of rate one or single-parity-check\n(SR1/SPC) nodes, which envelops a wide variety of existing special node types.\nThen, we analyse the parity constraints caused by the frozen bits in each\ndescendant node, such that the decoding performance of the SR1/SPC node can be\npreserved once the parity constraints are satisfied.

    "abstract": "The task of video virtual try-on aims to fit the target clothes to a person\nin the video with spatio-temporal consistency. Despite tremendous progress of\nimage virtual try-on, they lead to inconsistency between frames when applied to\nvideos. Limited work also explored the task of video-based virtual try-on but\nfailed to produce visually pleasing and temporally coherent results. Moreover,\nthere are two other key challenges: 1) how to generate accurate warping when\nocclusions appear in the clothing region; 2) how to generate clothes and\nnon-target body parts (e.g. arms, neck) in harmony with the complicated\nbackground; To address them, we propose a novel video virtual try-on framework,\nClothFormer, which successfully synthesizes realistic, harmonious, and\nspatio-temporal consistent results in complicated environment. In particular,\nClothFormer involves three major modules. First, a two-stage anti-occlusion\nwarping module that predicts an accurate dense flow mapping between the body\nregions and the clothing regions. Second, an appearance-flow tracking module\nutilizes ridge regression and optical flow correction to smooth the dense flow\nsequence and generate a temporally smooth warped clothing sequence. Third, a\ndual-stream transformer extracts and fuses clothing textures, person features,\nand environment information to generate realistic try-on videos. Through\nrigorous experiments, we demonstrate that our method highly surpasses the\nbaselines in terms of synthesized video quality both qualitatively and\nquantitatively.",

    "abstract": "The Stackelberg security game is played between a defender and an attacker,\nwhere the defender needs to allocate a limited amount of resources to multiple\ntargets in order to minimize the loss due to adversarial attack by the\nattacker. While allowing targets to have different values, classic settings\noften assume uniform requirements to defend the targets. This enables existing\nresults that study mixed strategies (randomized allocation algorithms) to adopt\na compact representation of the mixed strategies.\nIn this work, we initiate the study of mixed strategies for the security\ngames in which the targets can have different defending requirements. In\ncontrast to the case of uniform defending requirement, for which an optimal\nmixed strategy can be computed efficiently, we show that computing the optimal\nmixed strategy is NP-hard for the general defending requirements setting.\nHowever, we show that strong upper and lower bounds for the optimal mixed\nstrategy defending result can be derived. We propose an efficient\nclose-to-optimal Patching algorithm that computes mixed strategies that use\nonly few pure strategies. We also study the setting when the game is played on\na network and resource sharing is enabled between neighboring targets.

    "abstract": "Currently, the genetic programming version of the gene-pool optimal mixing\nevolutionary algorithm (GP-GOMEA) is among the top-performing algorithms for\nsymbolic regression (SR). A key strength of GP-GOMEA is its way of performing\nvariation, which dynamically adapts to the emergence of patterns in the\npopulation. However, GP-GOMEA lacks a mechanism to optimize coefficients. In\nthis paper, we study how fairly simple approaches for optimizing coefficients\ncan be integrated into GP-GOMEA. In particular, we considered two variants of\nGaussian coefficient mutation. We performed experiments using different\nsettings on 23 benchmark problems, and used machine learning to estimate what\naspects of coefficient mutation matter most. We find that the most important\naspect is that the number of coefficient mutation attempts needs to be\ncommensurate with the number of mixing operations that GP-GOMEA performs. We\napplied GP-GOMEA with the best-performing coefficient mutation approach to the\ndata sets of SRBench, a large SR benchmark, for which a ground-truth underlying\nequation is known. We find that coefficient mutation can help re-discovering\nthe underlying equation by a substantial amount, but only when no noise is\nadded to the target variable. In the presence of noise, GP-GOMEA with\ncoefficient mutation discovers alternative but similarly-accurate equations.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic behavior of jointed assemblies exhibiting friction nonlinearities\nfeatures amplitude-dependent dissipation and stiffness. To develop numerical\nsimulations for predictive and design purposes, macro-scale High Fidelity\nModels (HFMs) of the contact interfaces are required. However, the high\ncomputational cost of such HFMs impedes the feasibility of the simulations. To\nthis end, we propose a model-driven method for constructing hyper-reduced order\nmodels of such assemblies. Focusing on steady-state analysis, we use the\nMulti-Harmonic Balance Method (MHBM) to formulate the equations of motion in\nfrequency domain. The reduction basis is constructed through solving a set of\nvibration problems corresponding to fictitious interface conditions.\nSubsequently, a Galerkin projection reduces the order of the model.\nNonetheless, the necessary fine discretization of the interfaces represents a\nbottleneck for achieving high speedups. For this reason, we implement an\nadapted Energy Conserving Weighing and Sampling (ECSW) technique for Hyper\nReduction (HR), thereby allowing significant speedups for meshes of arbitrary\nfineness. This feature is particularly advantageous since analysts typically\nencounter a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost when deciding on\nthe mesh size, whose estimation is particularly challenging for problems of\nthis type. To assess the accuracy of our method without resorting to the HF\nsolution, we propose an error indicator with thresholds that have proven\nreliable in our analyses.

In this paper,\nwe address the problem by proposing a filter-based framework, which integrates\nthe visual-inertial odometry and the measurements of the features in the\npre-built map. In this framework, the transformation between the odometry frame\nand the map frame is augmented into the state and estimated on the fly.\nBesides, we maintain only the keyframe poses in the map and employ Schmidt\nextended Kalman filter to update the state partially, so that the uncertainty\nof the map information can be consistently considered with low computational\ncost. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that the ever-changing\nlinearization points of the estimated state can introduce spurious information\nto the augmented system and make the original four-dimensional unobservable\nsubspace vanish, leading to inconsistent estimation in practice. To relieve\nthis problem, we employ first-estimate Jacobian (FEJ) to maintain the correct\nobservability properties of the augmented system. Furthermore, we introduce an\nobservability-constrained updating method to compensate for the significant\naccumulated error after the long-term absence (can be 3 minutes and 1 km) of\nmap-based measurements.

    "abstract": "Most recommender systems optimize the model on observed interaction data,\nwhich is affected by the previous exposure mechanism and exhibits many biases\nlike popularity bias. The loss functions, such as the mostly used pointwise\nBinary Cross-Entropy and pairwise Bayesian Personalized Ranking, are not\ndesigned to consider the biases in observed data. As a result, the model\noptimized on the loss would inherit the data biases, or even worse, amplify the\nbiases. For example, a few popular items take up more and more exposure\nopportunities, severely hurting the recommendation quality on niche items --\nknown as the notorious Mathew effect. In this work, we develop a new learning\nparadigm named Cross Pairwise Ranking (CPR) that achieves unbiased\nrecommendation without knowing the exposure mechanism. Distinct from inverse\npropensity scoring (IPS), we change the loss term of a sample -- we\ninnovatively sample multiple observed interactions once and form the loss as\nthe combination of their predictions. We prove in theory that this way offsets\nthe influence of user/item propensity on the learning, removing the influence\nof data biases caused by the exposure mechanism. Advantageous to IPS, our\nproposed CPR ensures unbiased learning for each training instance without the\nneed of setting the propensity scores. Experimental results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of CPR over state-of-the-art debiasing solutions in both model\ngeneralization and training efficiency.

ICMT\nblock embeds convolution in the transformer, which can extract global\ninformation while retaining spatial and detailed information. Furthermore, we\ndesign a novel fusion mechanism based on cross attention and selfattention,\ncalled TMM block, which can effectively fuse features between different\nmodalities.

Existing\napproaches only enable the communication in a heuristic manner without\nconsidering the content/importance of information to be shared. In this paper,\nwe propose a universal communication form UniComm between intersections.\nUniComm embeds massive observations collected at one agent into crucial\npredictions of their impact on its neighbors, which improves the communication\nefficiency and is universal across existing methods. We also propose a concise\nnetwork UniLight to make full use of communications enabled by UniComm.\nExperimental results on real datasets demonstrate that UniComm universally\nimproves the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods, and UniLight\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods on a wide range of traffic\nsituations.",

To\naddress the bias of the empathetic intents distribution between empathetic\ndialogue models and humans, we propose a novel model to generate empathetic\nresponses with human-consistent empathetic intents, EmpHi for short.

    "abstract": "Devising intelligent agents able to live in an environment and learn by\nobserving the surroundings is a longstanding goal of Artificial Intelligence.\nFrom a bare Machine Learning perspective, challenges arise when the agent is\nprevented from leveraging large fully-annotated dataset, but rather the\ninteractions with supervisory signals are sparsely distributed over space and\ntime. This paper proposes a novel neural-network-based approach to\nprogressively and autonomously develop pixel-wise representations in a video\nstream. The proposed method is based on a human-like attention mechanism that\nallows the agent to learn by observing what is moving in the attended\nlocations. Spatio-temporal stochastic coherence along the attention trajectory,\npaired with a contrastive term, leads to an unsupervised learning criterion\nthat naturally copes with the considered setting. Differently from most\nexisting works, the learned representations are used in open-set\nclass-incremental classification of each frame pixel, relying on few\nsupervisions. Our experiments leverage 3D virtual environments and they show\nthat the proposed agents can learn to distinguish objects just by observing the\nvideo stream. Inheriting features from state-of-the art models is not as\npowerful as one might expect.",

    "abstract": "$ $Dialogue systems are evaluated depending on their type and purpose. Two\ncategories are often distinguished: (1) task-oriented dialogue systems (TDS),\nwhich are typically evaluated on utility, i.e., their ability to complete a\nspecified task, and (2) open domain chatbots, which are evaluated on the user\nexperience, i.e., based on their ability to engage a person. What is the\ninfluence of user experience on the user satisfaction rating of TDS as opposed\nto, or in addition to, utility? We collect data by providing an additional\nannotation layer for dialogues sampled from the ReDial dataset, a widely used\nconversational recommendation dataset. Unlike prior work, we annotate the\nsampled dialogues at both the turn and dialogue level on six dialogue aspects:\nrelevance, interestingness, understanding, task completion, efficiency, and\ninterest arousal. The annotations allow us to study how different dialogue\naspects influence user satisfaction. We introduce a comprehensive set of user\nexperience aspects derived from the annotators' open comments that can\ninfluence users' overall impression. We find that the concept of satisfaction\nvaries across annotators and dialogues, and show that a relevant turn is\nsignificant for some annotators, while for others, an interesting turn is all\nthey need. Our analysis indicates that the proposed user experience aspects\nprovide a fine-grained analysis of user satisfaction that is not captured by a\nmonolithic overall human rating.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks for visual content understanding have recently evolved from\nconvolutional ones (CNNs) to transformers. The prior (CNN) relies on\nsmall-windowed kernels to capture the regional clues, demonstrating solid local\nexpressiveness. On the contrary, the latter (transformer) establishes\nlong-range global connections between localities for holistic learning.\nInspired by this complementary nature, there is a growing interest in designing\nhybrid models to best utilize each technique. Current hybrids merely replace\nconvolutions as simple approximations of linear projection or juxtapose a\nconvolution branch with attention, without concerning the importance of\nlocal/global modeling. To tackle this, we propose a new hybrid named Adaptive\nSplit-Fusion Transformer (ASF-former) to treat convolutional and attention\nbranches differently with adaptive weights. Specifically, an ASF-former encoder\nequally splits feature channels into half to fit dual-path inputs. Then, the\noutputs of dual-path are fused with weighting scalars calculated from visual\ncues. We also design the convolutional path compactly for efficiency concerns.\nExtensive experiments on standard benchmarks, such as ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10,\nand CIFAR-100, show that our ASF-former outperforms its CNN, transformer\ncounterparts, and hybrid pilots in terms of accuracy (83.9% on ImageNet-1K),\nunder similar conditions (12.9G MACs/56.7M Params, without large-scale\npre-training).

    "abstract": "Collaborative Filtering (CF) has emerged as fundamental paradigms for\nparameterizing users and items into latent representation space, with their\ncorrelative patterns from interaction data. Among various CF techniques, the\ndevelopment of GNN-based recommender systems, e.g., PinSage and LightGCN, has\noffered the state-of-the-art performance. However, two key challenges have not\nbeen well explored in existing solutions: i) The over-smoothing effect with\ndeeper graph-based CF architecture, may cause the indistinguishable user\nrepresentations and degradation of recommendation results. ii) The supervision\nsignals (i.e., user-item interactions) are usually scarce and skewed\ndistributed in reality, which limits the representation power of CF paradigms.\nTo tackle these challenges, we propose a new self-supervised recommendation\nframework Hypergraph Contrastive Collaborative Filtering (HCCF) to jointly\ncapture local and global collaborative relations with a hypergraph-enhanced\ncross-view contrastive learning architecture. In particular, the designed\nhypergraph structure learning enhances the discrimination ability of GNN-based\nCF paradigm, in comprehensively capturing the complex high-order dependencies\namong users. Additionally, our HCCF model effectively integrates the hypergraph\nstructure encoding with self-supervised learning to reinforce the\nrepresentation quality of recommender systems, based on the hypergraph\nself-discrimination. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of our model over various state-of-the-art\nrecommendation methods, and the robustness against sparse user interaction\ndata.

    "abstract": "The dramatic increase of data breaches in modern computing platforms has\nemphasized that access control is not sufficient to protect sensitive user\ndata. Recent advances in cryptography allow end-to-end processing of encrypted\ndata without the need for decryption using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).\nSuch computation however, is still orders of magnitude slower than direct\n(unencrypted) computation. Depending on the underlying cryptographic scheme,\nFHE schemes can work natively either at bit-level using Boolean circuits, or\nover integers using modular arithmetic. Operations on integers are limited to\naddition/subtraction and multiplication. On the other hand, bit-level\narithmetic is much more comprehensive allowing more operations, such as\ncomparison and division. While modular arithmetic can emulate bit-level\ncomputation, there is a significant cost in performance. In this work, we\npropose a novel method, dubbed \\emph{bridging}, that blends faster and\nrestricted modular computation with slower and comprehensive bit-level\ncomputation, making them both usable within the same application and with the\nsame cryptographic scheme instantiation. We introduce and open source C++ types\nrepresenting the two distinct arithmetic modes, offering the possibility to\nconvert from one to the other. Experimental results show that bridging modular\nand bit-level arithmetic computation can lead to 1-2 orders of magnitude\nperformance improvement for tested synthetic benchmarks, as well as two\nreal-world FHE applications: A URL denylisting case study, and a genotype\nimputation application. Bridging performance enhancement comes from two\nfactors: 1) Reduced number of operations (especially ciphertext\nmultiplications), and 2) Arithmetic circuits with smaller multiplicative depth,\nallowing more efficient encryption parameters with smaller polynomial degrees.",

Extensive experimental\nevaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and superior performance of the\nproposed MA. Our method can be easily combined with existing methods and can\nimprove the transferability by up to 38.0% on MLP-based ResMLP. Adversarial\nexamples produced by our method on MLP-Mixer are able to exceed the\ntransferability of adversarial examples produced using DenseNet against CNNs.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first work to study adversarial\ntransferability of MLP-Mixer.",

    "title": "Managing Reliability Skew in DNA Storage",
    "abstract": "DNA is emerging as an increasingly attractive medium for data storage due to\na number of important and unique advantages it offers, most notably the\nunprecedented durability and density. While the technology is evolving rapidly,\nthe prohibitive cost of reads and writes, the high frequency and the peculiar\nnature of errors occurring in DNA storage pose a significant challenge to its\nadoption. In this work we make a novel observation that the probability of\nsuccessful recovery of a given bit from any type of a DNA-based storage system\nhighly depends on its physical location within the DNA molecule. In other\nwords, when used as a storage medium, some parts of DNA molecules appear\nsignificantly more reliable than others. We show that large differences in\nreliability between different parts of DNA molecules lead to highly inefficient\nuse of error-correction resources, and that commonly used techniques such as\nunequal error-correction cannot be used to bridge the reliability gap between\ndifferent locations in the context of DNA storage. We then propose two\napproaches to address the problem. The first approach is general and applies to\nany types of data; it stripes the data and ECC codewords across DNA molecules\nin a particular fashion such that the effects of errors are spread out evenly\nacross different codewords and molecules, effectively de-biasing the underlying\nstorage medium. The second approach is application-specific, and seeks to\nleverage the underlying reliability bias by using application-aware mapping of\ndata onto DNA molecules such that data that requires higher reliability is\nstored in more reliable locations, whereas data that needs lower reliability is\nstored in less reliable parts of DNA molecules. We show that the proposed data\nmapping can be used to achieve graceful degradation in the presence of high\nerror rates, or to implement the concept of approximate storage in DNA.",

In\nthis paper, we propose a multi-task approach for verifying the scientific\nquestions based on a joint reasoning from facts and evidence in research\narticles.

Thus on a given topic, our proposed approach conducts structured\ncontent modeling based on paper abstracts to answer a scientific question while\nhighlighting texts from paper that discuss the topic. We based our final system\non an end-to-end Extractive Question Answering (EQA) combined with a three\noutputs classification model to perform in-depth semantic understanding of a\nquestion to illustrate the aggregation of multiple responses. With our light\nand fast proposed architecture, we achieved an average error rate of 4% and a\nF1-score of 95.6%.

Despite the outstanding\nperformance, the heavy computation demanded by the deep models has restricted\nthe application of image restoration. To lift the restriction, it is required\nto reduce the size of the networks while maintaining accuracy. Recently, N:M\nstructured pruning has appeared as one of the effective and practical pruning\napproaches for making the model efficient with the accuracy constraint.\nHowever, it fails to account for different computational complexities and\nperformance requirements for different layers of an image restoration network.\nTo further optimize the trade-off between the efficiency and the restoration\naccuracy, we propose a novel pruning method that determines the pruning ratio\nfor N:M structured sparsity at each layer.

    "abstract": "Sentiment Analysis provides an opportunity to understand the subject(s),\nespecially in the digital age, due to an abundance of public data and effective\nalgorithms. Cybersecurity is a subject where opinions are plentiful and\ndiffering in the public domain. This descriptive research analyzed\ncybersecurity content on Twitter and Reddit to measure its sentiment, positive\nor negative, or neutral. The data from Twitter and Reddit was amassed via\ntechnology-specific APIs during a selected timeframe to create datasets, which\nwere then analyzed individually for their sentiment by VADER, an NLP (Natural\nLanguage Processing) algorithm. A random sample of cybersecurity content (ten\ntweets and posts) was also classified for sentiments by twenty human annotators\nto evaluate the performance of VADER. Cybersecurity content on Twitter was at\nleast 48% positive, and Reddit was at least 26.5% positive. The positive or\nneutral content far outweighed negative sentiments across both platforms. When\ncompared to human classification, which was considered the standard or source\nof truth, VADER produced 60% accuracy for Twitter and 70% for Reddit in\nassessing the sentiment; in other words, some agreement between algorithm and\nhuman classifiers. Overall, the goal was to explore an uninhibited research\ntopic about cybersecurity sentiment",

    "title": "Socio-technical constraints and affordances of virtual collaboration --  A study of four online hackathons",
    "abstract": "Hackathons and similar time-bounded events have become a popular form of\ncollaboration. They are commonly organized as in-person events during which\nteams engage in intense collaboration over a short period of time to complete a\nproject that is of interest to them. Most research to date has focused on\nstudying how teams collaborate in a co-located setting, pointing towards the\nadvantages of radical co-location. The global pandemic of 2020, however, has\nled to many hackathons moving online, which challenges our current\nunderstanding of how they function. In this paper, we address this gap by\npresenting findings from a multiple-case study of 10 hackathon teams that\nparticipated in 4 hackathons across two continents. By analyzing the collected\ndata, we found that teams merged synchronous and asynchronous means of\ncommunication to maintain a common understanding of work progress as well as to\nmaintain awareness of each other's tasks. Task division was self-assigned based\non individual skills or interests, while leaders emerged from different\nstrategies (e.g., participant experience, the responsibility of registering the\nteam in an event). Some of the affordances of in-person hackathons, such as the\nradical co-location of team members, could be partially reproduced in teams\nthat kept synchronous communication channels while working (i.e., shared audio\nterritories), in a sort of \"radical virtual co-location\". However, others, such\nas interactions with other teams, easy access to mentors, and networking with\nother participants, decreased. In addition, the technical constraints of the\ndifferent communication tools and platforms brought technical problems and were\noverwhelming to participants. Our work contributes to understanding the virtual\ncollaboration of small teams in the context of online hackathons and how\ntechnologies and event structures proposed by organizers imply this\ncollaboration.",

    "title": "Data-Efficient Backdoor Attacks",
    "abstract": "Recent studies have proven that deep neural networks are vulnerable to\nbackdoor attacks. Specifically, by mixing a small number of poisoned samples\ninto the training set, the behavior of the trained model can be maliciously\ncontrolled. Existing attack methods construct such adversaries by randomly\nselecting some clean data from the benign set and then embedding a trigger into\nthem. However, this selection strategy ignores the fact that each poisoned\nsample contributes inequally to the backdoor injection, which reduces the\nefficiency of poisoning. In this paper, we formulate improving the poisoned\ndata efficiency by the selection as an optimization problem and propose a\nFiltering-and-Updating Strategy (FUS) to solve it. The experimental results on\nCIFAR-10 and ImageNet-10 indicate that the proposed method is effective: the\nsame attack success rate can be achieved with only 47% to 75% of the poisoned\nsample volume compared to the random selection strategy. More importantly, the\nadversaries selected according to one setting can generalize well to other\nsettings, exhibiting strong transferability.",

    "title": "Federated Stochastic Primal-dual Learning with Differential Privacy",
    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a new paradigm that enables many clients to\njointly train a machine learning (ML) model under the orchestration of a\nparameter server while keeping the local data not being exposed to any third\nparty. However, the training of FL is an interactive process between local\nclients and the parameter server. Such process would cause privacy leakage\nsince adversaries may retrieve sensitive information by analyzing the overheard\nmessages. In this paper, we propose a new federated stochastic primal-dual\nalgorithm with differential privacy (FedSPD-DP). Compared to the existing\nmethods, the proposed FedSPD-DP incorporates local stochastic gradient descent\n(local SGD) and partial client participation (PCP) for addressing the issues of\ncommunication efficiency and straggler effects due to randomly accessed\nclients. Our analysis shows that the data sampling strategy and PCP can enhance\nthe data privacy whereas the larger number of local SGD steps could increase\nprivacy leakage, revealing a non-trivial tradeoff between algorithm\ncommunication efficiency and privacy protection. Specifically, we show that, by\nguaranteeing $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP for each client per communication round,\nthe proposed algorithm guarantees $(\\mathcal{O}(q\\epsilon \\sqrt{p T}),\n\\delta)$-DP after $T$ communication rounds while maintaining an\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{pTQ})$ convergence rate for a convex and non-smooth\nlearning problem, where $Q$ is the number of local SGD steps, $p$ is the client\nsampling probability, $q=\\max_{i} q_i/\\sqrt{1-q_i}$ and $q_i$ is the data\nsampling probability of each client under PCP.

    "abstract": "With the wide adoption of mobile devices and web applications, location-based\nsocial networks (LBSNs) offer large-scale individual-level location-related\nactivities and experiences. Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is one\nof the most important tasks in LBSNs, aiming to make personalized\nrecommendations of next suitable locations to users by discovering preferences\nfrom users' historical activities. Noticeably, LBSNs have offered unparalleled\naccess to abundant heterogeneous relational information about users and POIs\n(including user-user social relations, such as families or colleagues; and\nuser-POI visiting relations). Such relational information holds great potential\nto facilitate the next POI recommendation. However, most existing methods\neither focus on merely the user-POI visits, or handle different relations based\non over-simplified assumptions while neglecting relational heterogeneities. To\nfill these critical voids, we propose a novel framework, MEMO, which\neffectively utilizes the heterogeneous relations with a multi-network\nrepresentation learning module, and explicitly incorporates the inter-temporal\nuser-POI mutual influence with the coupled recurrent neural networks. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world LBSN data validate the superiority of our framework\nover the state-of-the-art next POI recommendation methods.",

    "abstract": "Long-form video understanding requires designing approaches that are able to\ntemporally localize activities or language. End-to-end training for such tasks\nis limited by the compute device memory constraints and lack of temporal\nannotations at large-scale. These limitations can be addressed by pre-training\non large datasets of temporally trimmed videos supervised by class annotations.\nOnce the video encoder is pre-trained, it is common practice to freeze it\nduring fine-tuning. Therefore, the video encoder does not learn temporal\nboundaries and unseen classes, causing a domain gap with respect to the\ndownstream tasks. Moreover, using temporally trimmed videos prevents to capture\nthe relations between different action categories and the background context in\na video clip which results in limited generalization capacity. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel post-pre-training approach without freezing the\nvideo encoder which leverages language.

    "abstract": "We propose a linear time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurement model to\nimprove \\textit{distributed} estimation performance for localized target\ntracking. We design distributed filters over sparse (possibly large-scale)\ncommunication networks using consensus-based data-fusion techniques. The\nproposed distributed and localized tracking protocols considerably reduce the\nsensor network's required connectivity and communication rate. We, further,\nconsider $\\kappa$-redundant observability and fault-tolerant design in case of\nlosing communication links or sensor nodes. We present the minimal conditions\non the remaining sensor network (after link/node removal) such that the\ndistributed observability is still preserved and, thus, the sensor network can\ntrack the (single) maneuvering target. The motivation is to reduce the\ncommunication load versus the processing load, as the computational units are,\nin general, less costly than the communication devices. We evaluate the\ntracking performance via simulations in MATLAB.",

    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been widely demonstrated their\npowerful ability in graph data representation and learning. Existing graph\nconvolution layers are mainly designed based on graph signal processing and\ntransform aspect which usually suffer from some limitations, such as\nover-smoothing, over-squashing and non-robustness, etc. As we all know that\nConvolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have received great success in many computer\nvision and machine learning. One main aspect is that CNNs leverage many\nlearnable convolution filters (kernels) to obtain rich feature descriptors and\nthus can have high capacity to encode complex patterns in visual data analysis.\nAlso, CNNs are flexible in designing their network architecture, such as\nMobileNet, ResNet, Xception, etc. Therefore, it is natural to arise a question:\ncan we design graph convolutional layer as flexibly as that in CNNs?\nInnovatively, in this paper, we consider connecting GCNs with CNNs deeply from\na general perspective of depthwise separable convolution operation.\nSpecifically, we show that GCN and GAT indeed perform some specific depthwise\nseparable convolution operations. This novel interpretation enables us to\nbetter understand the connections between GCNs (GCN, GAT) and CNNs and further\ninspires us to design more Unified GCNs (UGCNs). As two showcases, we implement\ntwo UGCNs, i.e., Separable UGCN (S-UGCN) and General UGCN (G-UGCN) for graph\ndata representation and learning. Promising experiments on several graph\nrepresentation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the\nproposed UGCNs.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a Power-of-Two post-training quantization( PTQ) method for deep\nneural network that meets hardware requirements and does not call for long-time\nretraining. PTQ requires a small set of calibration data and is easier for\ndeployment, but results in lower accuracy than Quantization-Aware Training(\nQAT). Power-of-Two quantization can convert the multiplication introduced by\nquantization and dequantization to bit-shift that is adopted by many efficient\naccelerators. However, the Power-of-Two scale has fewer candidate values, which\nleads to more rounding or clipping errors. We propose a novel Power-of-Two PTQ\nframework, dubbed RAPQ, which dynamically adjusts the Power-of-Two scales of\nthe whole network instead of statically determining them layer by layer. It can\ntheoretically trade off the rounding error and clipping error of the whole\nnetwork. Meanwhile, the reconstruction method in RAPQ is based on the BN\ninformation of every unit. Extensive experiments on ImageNet prove the\nexcellent performance of our proposed method. Without bells and whistles, RAPQ\ncan reach accuracy of 65% and 48% on ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2 respectively\nwith weight INT2 activation INT4. We are the first to propose PTQ for the more\nconstrained but hardware-friendly Power-of-Two quantization and prove that it\ncan achieve nearly the same accuracy as SOTA PTQ method.

By taking the\nuser-item interaction behavior as a graph, these graph-based CF models borrow\nthe success of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and iteratively perform\nneighborhood aggregation to propagate the collaborative signals. While\nconventional CF models are known for facing the challenges of the popularity\nbias that favors popular items, one may wonder \"Whether the existing\ngraph-based CF models alleviate or exacerbate popularity bias of recommender\nsystems?\" To answer this question, we first investigate the two-fold\nperformances w.r.t. accuracy and novelty for existing graph-based CF methods.\nThe empirical results show that symmetric neighborhood aggregation adopted by\nmost existing graph-based CF models exacerbate the popularity bias and this\nphenomenon becomes more serious as the depth of graph propagation increases.\nFurther, we theoretically analyze the cause of popularity bias for graph-based\nCF. Then, we propose a simple yet effective plugin, namely r-AdjNorm, to\nachieve an accuracy-novelty trade-off by controlling the normalization strength\nin the neighborhood aggregation process. Meanwhile, r-AdjNorm can be smoothly\napplied to the existing graph-based CF backbones without additional\ncomputation. Finally, experimental results on three benchmark datasets show\nthat our proposed method can improve novelty without sacrificing accuracy under\nvarious graph-based CF backbones.",

Porous structures are an interesting type for this\napproach, as they are flexible and allow for fluid transport. Within this work,\nthe Infill-Foam (InFoam) is proposed to print structures with graded porosity\nby liquid rope coiling (LRC). By exploiting LRC, the InFoam method could\nexploit the repeatable coiling patterns to print structures. To this end, only\nthe characterization of the relation between nozzle height and coil radius and\nthe extruded length were necessary (at a fixed temperature). Then by adjusting\nthe nozzle height and/or extrusion speed the porosity of the printed structure\ncould be set. The InFoam method was demonstrated by printing porous structures\nusing styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) with porosities ranging from\n46\\% to 89\\%. In compression tests, the cubes showed large changes in modulus\n(more than 200 times), density (-89\\% compared to bulk), and energy\ndissipation. The InFoam method combined coiling and normal plotting to realize\na large range of porosity gradients. This grading was exploited to realize\nrectangular structures with varying deformation patterns, which included\ntwisting, contraction, and bending. Furthermore, the InFoam method was shown to\nbe capable of programming the behavior of bending actuators by varying the\nporosity.

    "title": "ROMA: Cross-Domain Region Similarity Matching for Unpaired Nighttime  Infrared to Daytime Visible Video Translation",
    "abstract": "Infrared cameras are often utilized to enhance the night vision since the\nvisible light cameras exhibit inferior efficacy without sufficient\nillumination. However, infrared data possesses inadequate color contrast and\nrepresentation ability attributed to its intrinsic heat-related imaging\nprinciple. This makes it arduous to capture and analyze information for human\nbeings, meanwhile hindering its application. Although, the domain gaps between\nunpaired nighttime infrared and daytime visible videos are even huger than\npaired ones that captured at the same time, establishing an effective\ntranslation mapping will greatly contribute to various fields. In this case,\nthe structural knowledge within nighttime infrared videos and semantic\ninformation contained in the translated daytime visible pairs could be utilized\nsimultaneously. To this end, we propose a tailored framework ROMA that couples\nwith our introduced cRoss-domain regiOn siMilarity mAtching technique for\nbridging the huge gaps. To be specific, ROMA could efficiently translate the\nunpaired nighttime infrared videos into fine-grained daytime visible ones,\nmeanwhile maintain the spatiotemporal consistency via matching the cross-domain\nregion similarity. Furthermore, we design a multiscale region-wise\ndiscriminator to distinguish the details from synthesized visible results and\nreal references. Extensive experiments and evaluations for specific\napplications indicate ROMA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,\nwe provide a new and challenging dataset encouraging further research for\nunpaired nighttime infrared and daytime visible video translation, named\nInfraredCity. In particular, it consists of 9 long video clips including City,\nHighway and Monitor scenarios. All clips could be split into 603,142 frames in\ntotal, which are 20 times larger than the recently released daytime\ninfrared-to-visible dataset IRVI.",

The\nasymptotically fastest algorithm requires an ad-hoc condition on the system\ntype and uses large amounts of memory, limiting the size of the transition\nsystem that can be handled. A subsequent distributed algorithm is able to\nhandle larger systems by distributing the memory requirement over several\ncompute nodes, but this algorithm is asymptotically slower. We present an\nalgorithm that is applicable to all computable set functors, and runs in time\n$O(k^2 n \\log n)$, where n is the number of states and k is the number of\ntransitions per state. This algorithm is asymptotically slower than the fastest\nalgorithm by a factor of k, but asymptotically faster than the distributed\nalgorithm by a factor of n. In practice, our algorithm uses much less time and\nmemory on existing benchmarks.

Here, we address both problems by employing a deep reinforcement\nlearning model to optimize the social learning strategies (SLSs) of agents in a\ncooperative game in a multi-dimensional landscape. Throughout the training for\nmaximizing the overall payoff, we find that the agent spontaneously learns\nvarious concepts of social learning, such as copying, focusing on frequent and\nwell-performing neighbors, self-comparison, and the importance of balancing\nbetween individual and social learning, without any explicit guidance or prior\nknowledge about the system. The SLS from a fully trained agent outperforms all\nof the traditional, baseline SLSs in terms of mean payoff.

A common challenge for DNNs occurs when exposed to\nout-of-distribution samples that are outside of the scope of a DNN, but which\nresult in high confidence outputs despite no prior knowledge of such input.\nIn this paper, we analyze three methods that separate between in- and\nout-of-distribution data, called supervisors, on four well-known DNN\narchitectures. We find that the outlier detection performance improves with the\nquality of the model. We also analyse the performance of the particular\nsupervisors during the training procedure by applying the supervisor at a\npredefined interval to investigate its performance as the training proceeds. We\nobserve that understanding the relationship between training results and\nsupervisor performance is crucial to improve the model's robustness and to\nindicate, what input samples require further measures to improve the robustness\nof a DNN. In addition, our work paves the road towards an instrument for safety\nargumentation for safety critical applications.

Therefore, researchers and engineers have proposed numerous\ncomputational models to estimate thermal comfort (TC). Given the impetus toward\nenergy efficiency, the current focus is on data-driven TC prediction solutions\nthat leverage state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, an\nindoor occupant's perception of indoor thermal comfort (TC) is subjective and\nmulti-dimensional. Different aspects of TC are represented by various standard\nmetrics/scales viz., thermal sensation (TSV), thermal comfort (TCV), and\nthermal preference (TPV). The current ML-based TC prediction solutions adopt\nthe Single-task Learning approach, i.e., one prediction model per metric.\nConsequently, solutions often focus on only one TC metric. Moreover, when\nseveral metrics are considered, multiple TC models for a single indoor space\nlead to conflicting predictions, making real-world deployment infeasible. This\nwork addresses these problems. With the vision toward energy conservation and\nreal-world application, naturally ventilated primary school classrooms are\nconsidered.

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity education is considered an important part of undergraduate\ncomputing curricula, but many institutions teach it only in dedicated courses\nor tracks. This optionality risks students graduating with limited exposure to\nsecure coding practices that are expected in industry. An alternative approach\nis to integrate cybersecurity concepts across non-security courses, so as to\nexpose students to the interplay between security and other sub-areas of\ncomputing. In this paper, we report on our experience of applying the security\nintegration approach to an undergraduate web programming course. In particular,\nwe added a practical introduction to secure coding, which highlighted the OWASP\nTop 10 vulnerabilities by example, and demonstrated how to identify them using\nout-of-the-box security scanner tools (e.g. ZAP). Furthermore, we incentivised\nstudents to utilise these tools in their own course projects by offering bonus\nmarks. To assess the impact of this intervention, we scanned students' project\ncode over the last three years, finding a reduction in the number of\nvulnerabilities. Finally, in focus groups and a survey, students shared that\nour intervention helped to raise awareness, but they also highlighted the\nimportance of grading incentives and the need to teach security content\nearlier.",

STONNE is the first\ncycle-accurate simulator for reconfigurable DNN inference accelerators which\nallows for the exploration of accelerator designs and configuration space.\nHowever, preparing models for evaluation and exploring configuration space in\nSTONNE is a manual developer-timeconsuming process, which is a barrier for\nresearch. This paper introduces Bifrost, an end-to-end framework for the\nevaluation and optimization of reconfigurable DNN inference accelerators.\nBifrost operates as a frontend for STONNE and leverages the TVM deep learning\ncompiler stack to parse models and automate offloading of accelerated\ncomputations. We discuss Bifrost's advantages over STONNE and other tools, and\nevaluate the MAERI and SIGMA architectures using Bifrost. Additionally, Bifrost\nintroduces a module leveraging AutoTVM to efficiently explore accelerator\ndesigns and dataflow mapping space to optimize performance. This is\ndemonstrated by tuning the MAERI architecture and generating efficient dataflow\nmappings for AlexNet, obtaining an average speedup of $50\\times$ for the\nconvolutional layers and $11\\times$ for the fully connected layers.

    "abstract": "Battery cycle life prediction using early degradation data has many potential\napplications throughout the battery product life cycle. Various data-driven\nmethods have been proposed for point prediction of battery cycle life with\nminimum knowledge of the battery degradation mechanisms. However, management of\nbatteries at end-of-life with lower economic and technical risk requires\nprediction of cycle life with quantified uncertainty, which is still lacking.\nThe interpretability (i.e., the reason for high prediction accuracy) of these\nadvanced data-driven methods is also worthy of investigation. Here, a\nphysics-informed Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) model is introduced to make\ncycle life range prediction with uncertainty quantified as the length of the\nprediction interval, in addition to point predictions with high accuracy. The\nhyperparameters of the QRF model are tuned with a proposed area-based\nperformance evaluation metric so that the coverage probabilities associated\nwith the prediction intervals are calibrated. The interpretability of the final\nQRF model is explored with two global model-agnostic methods, namely\npermutation importance, and partial dependence plot.

    "abstract": "Recent research has highlighted that natural language processing (NLP)\nsystems exhibit a bias against African American speakers. The bias errors are\noften caused by poor representation of linguistic features unique to African\nAmerican English (AAE), due to the relatively low probability of occurrence of\nmany such features in training data. We present a workflow to overcome such\nbias in the case of habitual \"be\". Habitual \"be\" is isomorphic, and therefore\nambiguous, with other forms of \"be\" found in both AAE and other varieties of\nEnglish. This creates a clear challenge for bias in NLP technologies. To\novercome the scarcity, we employ a combination of rule-based filters and data\naugmentation that generate a corpus balanced between habitual and non-habitual\ninstances. With this balanced corpus, we train unbiased machine learning\nclassifiers, as demonstrated on a corpus of AAE transcribed texts, achieving\n.65 F$_1$ score disambiguating habitual \"be\".",

    "abstract": "The current cancer treatment practice collects multimodal data, such as\nradiology images, histopathology slides, genomics and clinical data. The\nimportance of these data sources taken individually has fostered the recent\nraise of radiomics and pathomics, i.e. the extraction of quantitative features\nfrom radiology and histopathology images routinely collected to predict\nclinical outcomes or to guide clinical decisions using artificial intelligence\nalgorithms. Nevertheless, how to combine them into a single multimodal\nframework is still an open issue. In this work we therefore develop a\nmultimodal late fusion approach that combines hand-crafted features computed\nfrom radiomics, pathomics and clinical data to predict radiation therapy\ntreatment outcomes for non-small-cell lung cancer patients. Within this\ncontext, we investigate eight different late fusion rules (i.e. product,\nmaximum, minimum, mean, decision template, Dempster-Shafer, majority voting,\nand confidence rule) and two patient-wise aggregation rules leveraging the\nrichness of information given by computer tomography images and whole-slide\nscans. The experiments in leave-one-patient-out cross-validation on an in-house\ncohort of 33 patients show that the proposed multimodal paradigm with an AUC\nequal to $90.9\\%$ outperforms each unimodal approach, suggesting that data\nintegration can advance precision medicine. As a further contribution, we also\ncompare the hand-crafted representations with features automatically computed\nby deep networks, and the late fusion paradigm with early fusion, another\npopular multimodal approach. In both cases, the experiments show that the\nproposed multimodal approach provides the best results.",

However,\ntraditional FL algorithms are based on an event-triggered aggregation, which\nsuffers from stragglers and communication overhead issues. To address these\nissues, in this paper, we present a time-triggered FL algorithm (TT-Fed) over\nwireless networks, which is a generalized form of classic synchronous and\nasynchronous FL. Taking the constrained resource and unreliable nature of\nwireless communication into account, we jointly study the user selection and\nbandwidth optimization problem to minimize the FL training loss. To solve this\njoint optimization problem, we provide a thorough convergence analysis for\nTT-Fed. Based on the obtained analytical convergence upper bound, the\noptimization problem is decomposed into tractable sub-problems with respect to\neach global aggregation round, and finally solved by our proposed online search\nalgorithm. Simulation results show that compared to asynchronous FL (FedAsync)\nand FL with asynchronous user tiers (FedAT) benchmarks, our proposed TT-Fed\nalgorithm improves the converged test accuracy by up to 12.5% and 5%,\nrespectively, under highly imbalanced and non-IID data, while substantially\nreducing the communication overhead.",

Second, the models are incrementally constrained to a smaller set of\nparameters, which facilitates alignment/merging of the local models and\nimproved learning performance at high sparsification rates. Third, the final\nsparsified model is significantly smaller, which improves inference efficiency\nand optimizes operations latency during encrypted communication.

Data assimilation is based on\na parametrized-background data weak methodology, in which the state of the\nphysical system -- tissue displacements and pressure fields -- is reconstructed\nfrom partially available data assuming an underlying poroelastic biomechanics\nmodel. For this purpose, a physics-informed manifold is built by sampling the\nspace of parameters describing the tissue model close to their physiological\nranges, to simulate the corresponding poroelastic problem, and compute a\nreduced basis. Displacements and pressure reconstruction is sought in a reduced\nspace after solving a minimization problem that encompasses both the structure\nof the reduced-order model and the available measurements. The proposed\npipeline is validated using synthetic data obtained after simulating the\nporoelastic mechanics on a physiological brain. The numerical experiments\ndemonstrate that the framework can exhibit accurate joint reconstructions of\nboth displacement and pressure fields. The methodology can be formulated for an\narbitrary resolution of available displacement data from pertinent images. It\ncan also inherently handle uncertainty on the physical parameters of the\nmechanical model by enlarging the physics-informed manifold accordingly.\nMoreover, the framework can be used to characterize, in silico, biomarkers for\npathological conditions, by appropriately training the reduced-order model.

    "abstract": "Event Detection (ED) is an important task in natural language processing. In\nthe past few years, many datasets have been introduced for advancing ED machine\nlearning models. However, most of these datasets are under-explored because not\nmany tools are available for people to study events, trigger words, and event\nmention instances systematically and efficiently. In this paper, we present an\ninteractive and easy-to-use tool, namely ED Explorer, for ED dataset and model\nexploration. ED Explorer consists of an interactive web application, an API,\nand an NLP toolkit, which can help both domain experts and non-experts to\nbetter understand the ED task. We use ED Explorer to analyze a recent proposed\nlarge-scale ED datasets (referred to as MAVEN), and discover several underlying\nproblems, including sparsity, label bias, label imbalance, and debatable\nannotations, which provide us with directions to improve the MAVEN dataset.

    "abstract": "This paper tackles the problem of learning value functions from undirected\nstate-only experience (state transitions without action labels i.e. (s,s',r)\ntuples). We first theoretically characterize the applicability of Q-learning in\nthis setting. We show that tabular Q-learning in discrete Markov decision\nprocesses (MDPs) learns the same value function under any arbitrary refinement\nof the action space. This theoretical result motivates the design of Latent\nAction Q-learning or LAQ, an offline RL method that can learn effective value\nfunctions from state-only experience. Latent Action Q-learning (LAQ) learns\nvalue functions using Q-learning on discrete latent actions obtained through a\nlatent-variable future prediction model. We show that LAQ can recover value\nfunctions that have high correlation with value functions learned using ground\ntruth actions. Value functions learned using LAQ lead to sample efficient\nacquisition of goal-directed behavior, can be used with domain-specific\nlow-level controllers, and facilitate transfer across embodiments. Our\nexperiments in 5 environments ranging from 2D grid world to 3D visual\nnavigation in realistic environments demonstrate the benefits of LAQ over\nsimpler alternatives, imitation learning oracles, and competing methods.",

Existing basic components in sparse convolutional networks\n(Sparse CNNs) process all sparse data, regardless of regular or submanifold\nsparse convolution. In this paper, we introduce two new modules to enhance the\ncapability of Sparse CNNs, both are based on making feature sparsity learnable\nwith position-wise importance prediction.

The new modules can readily substitute\ntheir plain counterparts in existing Sparse CNNs and be jointly trained in an\nend-to-end fashion. For the first time, we show that spatially learnable\nsparsity in sparse convolution is essential for sophisticated 3D object\ndetection.

    "abstract": "Recent studies on few-shot classification using transfer learning pose\nchallenges to the effectiveness and efficiency of episodic meta-learning\nalgorithms. Transfer learning approaches are a natural alternative, but they\nare restricted to few-shot classification. Moreover, little attention has been\non the development of probabilistic models with well-calibrated uncertainty\nfrom few-shot samples, except for some Bayesian episodic learning algorithms.\nTo tackle the aforementioned issues, we propose a new transfer learning method\nto obtain accurate and reliable models for few-shot regression and\nclassification. The resulting method does not require episodic meta-learning\nand is called meta-free representation learning (MFRL). MFRL first finds\nlow-rank representation generalizing well on meta-test tasks. Given the learned\nrepresentation, probabilistic linear models are fine-tuned with few-shot\nsamples to obtain models with well-calibrated uncertainty. The proposed method\nnot only achieves the highest accuracy on a wide range of few-shot learning\nbenchmark datasets but also correctly quantifies the prediction uncertainty. In\naddition, weight averaging and temperature scaling are effective in improving\nthe accuracy and reliability of few-shot learning in existing meta-learning\nalgorithms with a wide range of learning paradigms and model architectures.",

This study focusses on the SNQs present in\nthis standard related to spatial decay of speech, i.e. D 2S , L pAS4m and r c.\nThe aim is to provide additional information to the limited literature on the\nmeasurement uncertainties of these SNQs by use of both analytical developments\nand a stochastic approach based on simulations. The accuracy of the analytical\ndevelopments was studied thanks to simulations of the sound propagation within\na series of offices (1 layout, 16 acoustic configurations with different screen\nheights and different acoustic qualities of screens and ceiling). The SNQs\nobtained in the simulations cover a wide range: D 2S between 3.4 and 7.5 dB(A),\nL pAS4m between 40.6 and 51.9 dB(A) and r c between 2.5 and 14.7 m. Therefore,\nthe simulations are representative of a broad set of acoustic qualities.\nEstimated uncertainties have a magnitude of 0.4 dB(A) for D 2S and vary between\n0.4 and 0.7 dB(A) for L pAS4m and between 0.2 and 1.5 m for r c over a\nmeasurement path comprising 7 measurement positions. The simulations also raise\nthe question of describing the acoustic quality of an office using a single\nvalue for the indicators. The results of the simulations show that in some\ncases, D 2S values significantly depend on the measurement path, leading to a\nstrong increase of its measurement uncertainty if a unique value is to be\nconsidered.",

The\ndifferential privacy (DP) was proposed to address the problem of protecting the\nprivacy of each individual while keeping useful information about a population.\nSealfon (2016) introduced a private graph model in which the graph topology is\nassumed to be public while the weight information is assumed to be private.\nThat model can express hidden congestion patterns in a known transportation\nsystem. In this paper, we revisit the problem of privately releasing\napproximate distances between all pairs of vertices in (Sealfon 2016). Our goal\nis to minimize the additive error, namely the difference between the released\ndistance and actual distance under private setting. We propose improved\nsolutions to that problem for several cases.\nFor the problem of privately releasing all-pairs distances, we show that for\ntree with depth $h$, we can release all-pairs distances with additive error\n$O(\\log^{1.5} h \\cdot \\log^{1.5} V)$ for fixed privacy parameter where $V$ the\nnumber of vertices in the tree, which improves the previous error bound\n$O(\\log^{2.5} V)$, since the size of $h$ can be as small as $O(\\log V)$. Our\nresult implies that a $\\log V$ factor is saved, and the additive error in tree\ncan be smaller than the error on array/path. Additionally, for the grid graph\nwith arbitrary edge weights, we also propose a method to release all-pairs\ndistances with additive error $\\tilde O(V^{3/4}) $ for fixed privacy\nparameters.

Clustering a high-dimensional\nprotein sequence dataset using traditional machine learning approaches poses\nmany challenges. Many different feature extraction methods exist and are widely\nused. However, extracting features from millions of protein sequences becomes\nimpractical because they are not scalable with current algorithms. Therefore,\nthere is a need for an efficient feature extraction approach that extracts\nsignificant features. We have proposed two scalable feature extraction\napproaches for extracting features from huge protein sequences using Apache\nSpark, which are termed 60d-SPF (60-dimensional Scalable Protein Feature) and\n6d-SCPSF (6-dimensional Scalable Co-occurrence-based Probability-Specific\nFeature). The proposed 60d-SPF and 6d-SCPSF approaches capture the statistical\nproperties of amino acids to create a fixed-length numeric feature vector that\nrepresents each protein sequence in terms of 60-dimensional and 6-dimensional\nfeatures, respectively. The preprocessed huge protein sequences are used as an\ninput in two clustering algorithms, i.e., Scalable Random Sampling with\nIterative Optimization Fuzzy c-Means (SRSIO-FCM) and Scalable Literal Fuzzy\nC-Means (SLFCM) for clustering. We have conducted extensive experiments on\nvarious soybean protein datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed feature extraction methods, 60d-SPF, 6d-SCPSF, and existing feature\nextraction methods on SRSIO-FCM and SLFCM clustering algorithms.

Existing computational models either\nlack biological plausibility or fall short of behavioral flexibility when\nenvironments change. In this paper, we propose a computational theory that\nachieves behavioral flexibility with better biological plausibility. We first\ntrain a mixture of Gaussian distributions to model the ensemble of firing\nfields of place cells. Then we propose a Hebbian-like rule to learn the\nsynaptic strength matrix among place cells. This matrix is interpreted as the\ntransition rate matrix of a continuous time Markov chain to generate the\nsequential replay of place cells. During replay, the synaptic strengths from\nplace cells to medium spiny neurons (MSN) are learned by a temporal-difference\nlike rule to store place-reward associations. After replay, the activation of\nMSN will ramp up when an animal approaches the rewarding place, so the animal\ncan move along the direction where the MSN activation is increasing to find the\nrewarding place. We implement our theory into a high-fidelity virtual rat in\nthe MuJoCo physics simulator. In a complex maze, the rat shows significantly\nbetter learning efficiency and behavioral flexibility than a rat that\nimplements a neuroscience-inspired reinforcement learning algorithm, deep\nQ-network.",

In particular, the observations on real\ndata show that various relationships between company users have additional\npower in financial risk analysis. In this paper, we consider a graph of banking\ndata, and propose a novel HIDAM model for the purpose. Specifically, we attempt\nto incorporate heterogeneous information network with rich attributes on\nmulti-typed nodes and links for modeling the scenario of business banking\nservice. To enhance feature representation of MSEs, we extract interactive\ninformation through meta-paths and fully exploit path information. Furthermore,\nwe devise a hierarchical attention mechanism respectively to learn the\nimportance of contents inside each meta-path and the importance of different\nmetapahs. Experimental results verify that HIDAM outperforms state-of-the-art\ncompetitors on real-world banking data.",

    "abstract": "One of the core problems in mean-field control and mean-field games is to\nsolve the corresponding McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential\nequations (MV-FBSDEs). Most existing methods are tailored to special cases in\nwhich the mean-field interaction only depends on expectation or other moments\nand thus inadequate to solve problems when the mean-field interaction has full\ndistribution dependence. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method\nfor computing MV-FBSDEs with a general form of mean-field interactions.\nSpecifically, built on fictitious play, we recast the problem into repeatedly\nsolving standard FBSDEs with explicit coefficient functions. These coefficient\nfunctions are used to approximate the MV-FBSDEs' model coefficients with full\ndistribution dependence, and are updated by solving another supervising\nlearning problem using training data simulated from the last iteration's FBSDE\nsolutions. We use deep neural networks to solve standard BSDEs and approximate\ncoefficient functions in order to solve high-dimensional MV-FBSDEs. Under\nproper assumptions on the learned functions, we prove that the convergence of\nthe proposed method is free of the curse of dimensionality (CoD) by using the\ngeneralized maximum mean discrepancy metric previously developed in [Han, Hu\nand Long, arXiv:2104.12036].

These models have demonstrated\nsuperior performance in the generation, structure classification, and\nfunctional predictions for proteins and molecules with learned representations.\nHowever, most of the masking-based pre-trained language models are not designed\nfor generative design, and their black-box nature makes it difficult to\ninterpret their design logic. Here we propose BLMM Crystal Transformer, a\nneural network based probabilistic generative model for generative and\ntinkering design of inorganic materials. Our model is built on the blank\nfilling language model for text generation and has demonstrated unique\nadvantages in learning the \"materials grammars\" together with high-quality\ngeneration, interpretability, and data efficiency. It can generate chemically\nvalid materials compositions with as high as 89.7\\% charge neutrality and\n84.8\\% balanced electronegativity, which are more than 4 and 8 times higher\ncompared to a pseudo random sampling baseline. The probabilistic generation\nprocess of BLMM allows it to recommend tinkering operations based on learned\nmaterials chemistry and makes it useful for materials doping. Combined with the\nTCSP crysal structure prediction algorithm, We have applied our model to\ndiscover a set of new materials as validated using DFT calculations.

However, in real-world settings, patients often suffer from loss of\nvision on time scales of years despite therapy, whereas the prediction of the\nvisual acuity (VA) and the earliest possible detection of deterioration under\nreal-life conditions is challenging due to heterogeneous and incomplete data.\nIn this contribution, we present a workflow for the development of a\nresearch-compatible data corpus fusing different IT systems of the department\nof ophthalmology of a German maximum care hospital. The extensive data corpus\nallows predictive statements of the expected progression of a patient and his\nor her VA in each of the three diseases.

Our OCT biomarker classification\nusing an ensemble of deep neural networks results in a classification accuracy\n(F1-score) of over 98 %, enabling us to complete incomplete OCT documentations\nwhile allowing us to exploit them for a more precise VA modelling process. Our\nVA prediction requires at least four VA examinations and optionally OCT\nbiomarkers from the same time period to predict the VA progression within a\nforecasted time frame.

    "abstract": "Robust output tracking is addressed in this paper for a heat equation with\nNeumann boundary conditions and anti-collocated boundary input and output. The\ndesired reference tracking is solved using the well-known flatness and Lyapunov\napproaches. The reference profile is obtained by solving the motion planning\nproblem for the nominal plant. To robustify the closed-loop system in the\npresence of the disturbances and uncertainties, it is then augmented with PI\nfeedback plus a discontinuous component responsible for rejecting matched\ndisturbances with \\textit{a priori} known magnitude bounds. Such control law\nonly requires the information of the system at the same boundary as the control\ninput is located. The resulting dynamic controller globally exponentially\nstabilizes the error dynamics while also attenuating the influence of\nLipschitz-in-time external disturbances and parameter uncertainties. For the\ncase when the motion planning is performed over the uncertain plant, an\nexponential Input-to-State Stability is obtained, preserving the boundedness of\nthe tracking error norm. The proposed controller relies on a discontinuous term\nthat however passes through an integrator, thereby minimizing the chattering\neffect in the plant dynamics. The performance of the closed-loop system, thus\ndesigned, is illustrated in simulations under different kinds of reference\ntrajectories in the presence of external disturbances and parameter\nuncertainties.",

This paper leverages stochastic geometry to propose a novel\nframework for the performance analysis of heterogeneous vehicular networks with\nRSUs, vehicle relays, and vehicle users. We present a two-dimensional\nanalytical model where the spatial dependence between RSUs, vehicle relays,\nvehicle users, and roads is accurately taken into account through a Cox point\nprocess structure. Assuming relays are backhauled to RSUs over a reserved\nwireless resource and users are associated with the closest RSU or relay, we\nderive the probability that the typical user is associated with either an RSU\nor a relay. Then, we derive the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) coverage\nprobability of the typical user. Finally, using the derived formulas, we\nevaluate the average effective rate of the typical user in the network.

These representations are pre-trained by\nself-supervised learning methods that create training signals from the input.\nFor example, typical audio contrastive learning uses temporal relationships\namong input sounds to create training signals, whereas some methods use a\ndifference among input views created by data augmentations. However, these\ntraining signals do not provide information derived from the intact input\nsound, which we think is suboptimal for learning representation that describes\nthe input as it is.\nIn this paper, we seek to learn audio representations from the input itself\nas supervision using a pretext task of auto-encoding of masked spectrogram\npatches, Masked Spectrogram Modeling (MSM, a variant of Masked Image Modeling\napplied to audio spectrogram). To implement MSM, we use Masked Autoencoders\n(MAE), an image self-supervised learning method. MAE learns to efficiently\nencode the small number of visible patches into latent representations to carry\nessential information for reconstructing a large number of masked patches.\nWhile training, MAE minimizes the reconstruction error, which uses the input as\ntraining signal, consequently achieving our goal.\nWe conducted experiments on our MSM using MAE (MSM-MAE) models under the\nevaluation benchmark of the HEAR 2021 NeurIPS Challenge. Our MSM-MAE models\noutperformed the HEAR 2021 Challenge results on seven out of 15 tasks (e.g.,\naccuracies of 73.4% on CREMA-D and 85.8% on LibriCount), while showing top\nperformance on other tasks where specialized models perform better. We also\ninvestigate how the design choices of MSM-MAE impact the performance and\nconduct qualitative analysis of visualization outcomes to gain an understanding\nof learned representations.

    "abstract": "Microbes have a profound impact on our health and environment, but our\nunderstanding of the diversity and function of microbial communities is\nseverely limited. Through DNA sequencing of microbial communities\n(metagenomics), DNA fragments (reads) of the individual microbes can be\nobtained, which through assembly graphs can be combined into long contiguous\nDNA sequences (contigs). Given the complexity of microbial communities, single\ncontig microbial genomes are rarely obtained. Instead, contigs are eventually\nclustered into bins, with each bin ideally making up a full genome. This\nprocess is referred to as metagenomic binning.\nCurrent state-of-the-art techniques for metagenomic binning rely only on the\nlocal features for the individual contigs. These techniques therefore fail to\nexploit the similarities between contigs as encoded by the assembly graph, in\nwhich the contigs are organized. In this paper, we propose to use Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) to leverage the assembly graph when learning contig\nrepresentations for metagenomic binning. Our method, VaeG-Bin, combines\nvariational autoencoders for learning latent representations of the individual\ncontigs, with GNNs for refining these representations by taking into account\nthe neighborhood structure of the contigs in the assembly graph. We explore\nseveral types of GNNs and demonstrate that VaeG-Bin recovers more high-quality\ngenomes than other state-of-the-art binners on both simulated and real-world\ndatasets.",

    "abstract": "During the first years of life, infant vocalizations change considerably, as\ninfants develop the vocalization skills that enable them to produce speech\nsounds. Characterizations based on specific acoustic features, protophone\ncategories, or phonetic transcription are able to provide a representation of\nthe sounds infants make at different ages and in different contexts but do not\nfully describe how sounds are perceived by listeners, can be inefficient to\nobtain at large scales, and are difficult to visualize in two dimensions\nwithout additional statistical processing. Machine-learning-based approaches\nprovide the opportunity to complement these characterizations with purely\ndata-driven representations of infant sounds. Here, we use spectral features\nextraction and unsupervised machine learning, specifically Uniform Manifold\nApproximation (UMAP), to obtain a novel 2-dimensional spatial representation of\ninfant and caregiver vocalizations extracted from day-long home recordings.\nUMAP yields a continuous and well-distributed space conducive to certain\nanalyses of infant vocal development. For instance, we found that the\ndispersion of infant vocalization acoustics within the 2-D space over a day\nincreased from 3 to 9 months, and then decreased from 9 to 18 months.

    "title": "Explaining Adverse Actions in Credit Decisions Using Shapley  Decomposition",
    "abstract": "When a financial institution declines an application for credit, an adverse\naction (AA) is said to occur. The applicant is then entitled to an explanation\nfor the negative decision. This paper focuses on credit decisions based on a\npredictive model for probability of default and proposes a methodology for AA\nexplanation. The problem involves identifying the important predictors\nresponsible for the negative decision and is straightforward when the\nunderlying model is additive. However, it becomes non-trivial even for linear\nmodels with interactions. We consider models with low-order interactions and\ndevelop a simple and intuitive approach based on first principles. We then show\nhow the methodology generalizes to the well-known Shapely decomposition and the\nrecently proposed concept of Baseline Shapley (B-Shap). Unlike other Shapley\ntechniques in the literature for local interpretability of machine learning\nresults, B-Shap is computationally tractable since it involves just function\nevaluations. An illustrative case study is used to demonstrate the usefulness\nof the method. The paper also discusses situations with highly correlated\npredictors and desirable properties of fitted models in the credit-lending\ncontext, such as monotonicity and continuity.",

    "abstract": "Quantum machine learning is receiving significant attention currently, but\nits usefulness in comparison to classical machine learning techniques for\npractical applications remains unclear. However, there are indications that\ncertain quantum machine learning algorithms might result in improved training\ncapabilities with respect to their classical counterparts -- which might be\nparticularly beneficial in situations with little training data available. Such\nsituations naturally arise in medical classification tasks. Within this paper,\ndifferent hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural networks (QCCNN) with\nvarying quantum circuit designs and encoding techniques are proposed. They are\napplied to two- and three-dimensional medical imaging data, e.g. featuring\ndifferent, potentially malign, lesions in computed tomography scans. The\nperformance of these QCCNNs is already similar to the one of their classical\ncounterparts -- therefore encouraging further studies towards the direction of\napplying these algorithms within medical imaging tasks.",

    "abstract": "We propose a population-level analysis to address issues of data sparsity\nwhen building predictive models of engineering infrastructure. By sharing\ninformation between similar assets, hierarchical Bayesian modelling is used to\nimprove the survival analysis of a truck fleet (hazard curves) and power\nprediction in a wind farm (power curves). In each example, a set of correlated\nfunctions are learnt over the asset fleet, in a combined inference, to learn a\npopulation model. Parameter estimation is improved when sub-fleets of assets\nare allowed to share correlated information at different levels in the\nhierarchy. In turn, groups with incomplete data automatically borrow\nstatistical strength from those that are data-rich. The correlations can be\ninspected to inform which assets share information for which effect (i.e.\nparameter).",

    "abstract": "Extensive data labeling on neurophysiological signals is often prohibitively\nexpensive or impractical, as it may require particular infrastructure or domain\nexpertise. To address the appetite for data of deep learning methods, we\npresent for the first time a Fourier-based modeling framework for\nself-supervised pre-training of neurophysiology signals. The intuition behind\nour approach is simple: frequency and phase distribution of neurophysiology\nsignals reveal the underlying neurophysiological activities of the brain and\nmuscle. Our approach first randomly masks out a portion of the input signal and\nthen predicts the missing information from either spatiotemporal or the Fourier\ndomain. Pre-trained models can be potentially used for downstream tasks such as\nsleep stage classification using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and gesture\nrecognition using electromyography (EMG) signals. Unlike contrastive-based\nmethods, which strongly rely on carefully hand-crafted augmentations and\nsiamese structure, our approach works reasonably well with a simple transformer\nencoder with no augmentation requirements. By evaluating our method on several\nbenchmark datasets, including both EEG and EMG, we show that our modeling\napproach improves downstream neurophysiological related tasks by a large\nmargin.",

    "abstract": "We provide sharp path-dependent generalization and excess error guarantees\nfor the full-batch Gradient Decent (GD) algorithm for smooth losses (possibly\nnon-Lipschitz, possibly nonconvex). At the heart of our analysis is a novel\ngeneralization error technique for deterministic symmetric algorithms, that\nimplies average output stability and a bounded expected gradient of the loss at\ntermination leads to generalization. This key result shows that small\ngeneralization error occurs at stationary points, and allows us to bypass\nLipschitz assumptions on the loss prevalent in previous work. For nonconvex,\nconvex and strongly convex losses, we show the explicit dependence of the\ngeneralization error in terms of the accumulated path-dependent optimization\nerror, terminal optimization error, number of samples, and number of\niterations. For nonconvex smooth losses, we prove that full-batch GD\nefficiently generalizes close to any stationary point at termination, under the\nproper choice of a decreasing step size. Further, if the loss is nonconvex but\nthe objective is PL, we derive vanishing bounds on the corresponding excess\nrisk. For convex and strongly-convex smooth losses, we prove that full-batch GD\ngeneralizes even for large constant step sizes, and achieves a small excess\nrisk while training fast. Our full-batch GD generalization error and excess\nrisk bounds are significantly tighter than the existing bounds for (stochastic)\nGD, when the loss is smooth (but possibly non-Lipschitz).",

    "abstract": "Intermittent renewable energy resources like wind and solar pose great\nuncertainty of multiple time scales, from minutes to years, on the design and\noperation of power systems. Energy system optimization models have been\ndeveloped to find the least-cost solution to matching the uncertainty with\nflexibility resources. However, input data that capture such multi-time-scale\nuncertainty are characterized with a long time horizon and bring great\ndifficulty to solving the optimization model. Here we propose an adaptive\nclustering method based on the decision variables of optimization model to\nalleviate the computational complexity, in which the energy system is optimized\nover selected representative time periods instead of the full time horizon. The\nproposed clustering method is adaptive to various energy system optimization\nmodels or settings, because it extracts features from the optimization models.\nResults show that the proposed clustering method can significantly lower the\nerror in approximating the solution with the full time horizon, compared to\ntraditional clustering methods.",
