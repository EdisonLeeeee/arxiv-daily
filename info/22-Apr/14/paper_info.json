    "abstract": "The timely sharing of raw sensing information in the vehicular networks\n(VNETs) is essential to safety. In order to improve the freshness of sensing\ninformation, joint scheduling of multi-dimensional resources such as\ncommunication and computation is required. However, the complex relevance among\nmulti-dimensional resources is still unclear, and it is difficult to achieve\nefficient resource utilization. In this paper, we present a theoretical\nanalysis for a novel metric Age of Information (AoI) on a communication and\ncomputation assisted spatial-temporal model. An uplink VNETs scenario where\nRoad Side Units (RSUs) are deployed with computational resource is considered.\nThe transmission and computation process is unified into a two-stage tandem\nqueue and the expression of the average AoI is derived. The network\ninterference is analyzed by modeling the VNETs as Cox Poisson Point Process\nbased on stochastic geometry and the closed-form solution of the coverage\nprobability and the expected data rate performance under the constraints of\ntransmission resources is obtained. The simulation results reveal the basic\nrelationship between communication and computation capacity and show that\ncommunication and computation should reach a tradeoff to improve resource\nutilization while ensuring real-time information requirement.",

    "abstract": "Code is seldom written in a single left-to-right pass and is instead\nrepeatedly edited and refined. We introduce InCoder, a unified generative model\nthat can perform program synthesis (via left-to-right generation) as well as\nediting (via infilling). InCoder is trained to generate code files from a large\ncorpus of permissively licensed code, where regions of code have been randomly\nmasked and moved to the end of each file, allowing code infilling with\nbidirectional context. Our model is the first generative model that is able to\ndirectly perform zero-shot code infilling, which we evaluate on challenging\ntasks such as type inference, comment generation, and variable re-naming. We\nfind that the ability to condition on bidirectional context substantially\nimproves performance on these tasks, while still performing comparably on\nstandard program synthesis benchmarks in comparison to left-to-right only\nmodels pretrained at similar scale. The InCoder models and code are publicly\nreleased. https://sites.google.com/view/incoder-code-models",

However, there is limited research that\nstudies which characteristics of articles' metadata (title, abstract, keywords,\nand author list) are driving citations in this field. Objective: In this study,\nwe propose a simple theoretical model for how citations come to be with respect\nto article metadata, we hypothesize theoretical linkages between metadata\ncharacteristics and citations of articles, and we empirically test these\nhypotheses. Method: We use multiple regression analyses to examine a data set\ncomprising the titles, abstracts, keywords, and authors of 16,131 software\nengineering articles published between 1990 and 2020 in 20 highly influential\nsoftware engineering venues. Results: We find that number of authors, number of\nkeywords, number of question marks and dividers in the title, number of\nacronyms, abstract length, abstract propositional idea density, and\ncorresponding authors in the core Anglosphere are significantly related to\ncitations. Conclusion: Various characteristics of articles' metadata are linked\nto the frequency with which the corresponding articles are cited.

    "abstract": "When users lack specific knowledge of various system parameters, their\nuncertainty may lead them to make undesirable deviations in their decision\nmaking. To alleviate this, an informed system operator may elect to signal\ninformation to uninformed users with the hope of persuading them to take more\npreferable actions. In this work, we study public and truthful signalling\nmechanisms in the context of Bayesian congestion games on parallel networks. We\nprovide bounds on the possible benefit a signalling policy can provide with and\nwithout the concurrent use of monetary incentives. We find that though\nrevealing information can reduce system cost in some settings, it can also be\ndetrimental and cause worse performance than not signalling at all. However, by\nutilizing both signalling and incentive mechanisms, the system operator can\nguarantee that revealing information does not worsen performance while offering\nsimilar opportunities for improvement. These findings emerge from the closed\nform bounds we derive on the benefit a signalling policy can provide. We\nprovide a numerical example which illustrates the phenomenon that revealing\nmore information can degrade performance when incentives are not used and\nimproves performance when incentives are used.",

    "abstract": "With the ever-increasing dataset sizes, several file formats such as Parquet,\nORC, and Avro have been developed to store data efficiently, save the network,\nand interconnect bandwidth at the price of additional CPU utilization. However,\nwith the advent of networks supporting 25-100 Gb/s and storage devices\ndelivering 1, 000, 000 reqs/sec, the CPU has become the bottleneck trying to\nkeep up feeding data in and out of these fast devices. The result is that data\naccess libraries executed on single clients are often CPU-bound and cannot\nutilize the scale-out benefits of distributed storage systems. One attractive\nsolution to this problem is to offload data-reducing processing and filtering\ntasks to the storage layer. However, modifying legacy storage systems to\nsupport compute offloading is often tedious and requires an extensive\nunderstanding of the system internals. Previous approaches re-implemented\nfunctionality of data processing frameworks and access libraries for a\nparticular storage system, a duplication of effort that might have to be\nrepeated for different storage systems. This paper introduces a new design\nparadigm that allows extending programmable object storage systems to embed\nexisting, widely used data processing frameworks and access libraries into the\nstorage layer with no modifications. In this approach, data processing\nframeworks and access libraries can evolve independently from storage systems\nwhile leveraging distributed storage systems scale-out and availability\nproperties.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Large-scale electronic health record(EHR) datasets often\ninclude simple informative features like patient age and complex data like care\nhistory that are not easily represented as individual features. Such complex\ndata have the potential to both improve the quality of risk assessment and to\nenable a better understanding of causal factors leading to those risks. We\npropose a hybrid feature- and similarity-based model for supervised learning\nthat combines feature and kernel learning approaches to take advantage of rich\nbut heterogeneous observational data sources to create interpretable models for\nprediction and for investigation of causal relationships. Methods: The proposed\nhybrid model is fit by convex optimization with a sparsity-inducing penalty on\nthe kernel portion. Feature and kernel coefficients can be fit sequentially or\nsimultaneously. We compared our models to solely feature- and similarity-based\napproaches using synthetic data and using EHR data from a primary health care\norganization to predict risk of loneliness or social isolation. We also present\na new strategy for kernel construction that is suited to high-dimensional\nindicator-coded EHR data. Results: The hybrid models had comparable or better\npredictive performance than the feature- and kernel-based approaches in both\nthe synthetic and clinical case studies. The inherent interpretability of the\nhybrid model is used to explore client characteristics stratified by kernel\ncoefficient direction in the clinical case study; we use simple examples to\ndiscuss opportunities and cautions of the two hybrid model forms when causal\ninterpretations are desired. Conclusion: Hybrid feature- and similarity-based\nmodels provide an opportunity to capture complex, high-dimensional data within\nan additive model structure that supports improved prediction and\ninterpretation relative to simple models and opaque complex models.",

Functional interfaces\noffer many advantages, including being safe for parallelism and providing\nsimple and lightweight snapshots. However, existing high-performance functional\ninterfaces such as PAM, which are based on balanced purely-functional trees,\nincur large space overheads for large-scale data analysis due to storing every\nelement in a separate node in a tree.\nThis paper presents PaC-trees, a purely-functional data structure supporting\nfunctional interfaces for sets, maps, and sequences that provides a significant\nreduction in space over existing approaches. A PaC-tree is a balanced binary\nsearch tree which blocks the leaves and compresses the blocks using arrays. We\nprovide novel techniques for compressing and uncompressing the blocks which\nyield practical parallel functional algorithms for a broad set of operations on\nPaC-trees such as union, intersection, filter, reduction, and range queries\nwhich are both theoretically and practically efficient.\nUsing PaC-trees we designed CPAM, a C++ library that implements the full\nfunctionality of PAM, while offering significant extra functionality for\ncompression.

On applications including inverted indices, 2D range queries, and 1D\ninterval queries, CPAM is competitive with or faster than PAM, while using\n2.1--7.8x less space.

    "abstract": "An abundance of datasets and availability of reliable evaluation metrics have\nresulted in strong progress in factoid question answering (QA). This progress,\nhowever, does not easily transfer to the task of long-form QA, where the goal\nis to answer questions that require in-depth explanations. The hurdles include\n(i) a lack of high-quality data, and (ii) the absence of a well-defined notion\nof the answer's quality. In this work, we address these problems by (i)\nreleasing a novel dataset and a task that we call ASQA (Answer Summaries for\nQuestions which are Ambiguous); and (ii) proposing a reliable metric for\nmeasuring performance on ASQA. Our task focuses on factoid questions that are\nambiguous, that is, have different correct answers depending on interpretation.\nAnswers to ambiguous questions should synthesize factual information from\nmultiple sources into a long-form summary that resolves the ambiguity. In\ncontrast to existing long-form QA tasks (such as ELI5), ASQA admits a clear\nnotion of correctness: a user faced with a good summary should be able to\nanswer different interpretations of the original ambiguous question. We use\nthis notion of correctness to define an automated metric of performance for\nASQA. Our analysis demonstrates an agreement between this metric and human\njudgments, and reveals a considerable gap between human performance and strong\nbaselines.",

    "abstract": "Due to its high expressiveness and speed, Deep Learning (DL) has become an\nincreasingly popular choice as the detection algorithm for Network-based\nIntrusion Detection Systems (NIDSes). Unfortunately, DL algorithms are\nvulnerable to adversarial examples that inject imperceptible modifications to\nthe input and cause the DL algorithm to misclassify the input. Existing\nadversarial attacks in the NIDS domain often manipulate the traffic features\ndirectly, which hold no practical significance because traffic features cannot\nbe replayed in a real network. It remains a research challenge to generate\npractical and evasive adversarial attacks.\nThis paper presents the Liuer Mihou attack that generates practical and\nreplayable adversarial network packets that can bypass anomaly-based NIDS\ndeployed in the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The core idea behind Liuer\nMihou is to exploit adversarial transferability and generate adversarial\npackets on a surrogate NIDS constrained by predefined mutation operations to\nensure practicality. We objectively analyse the evasiveness of Liuer Mihou\nagainst four ML-based algorithms (LOF, OCSVM, RRCF, and SOM) and the\nstate-of-the-art NIDS, Kitsune. From the results of our experiment, we gain\nvaluable insights into necessary conditions on the adversarial transferability\nof anomaly detection algorithms. Going beyond a theoretical setting, we replay\nthe adversarial attack in a real IoT testbed to examine the practicality of\nLiuer Mihou. Furthermore, we demonstrate that existing feature-level\nadversarial defence cannot defend against Liuer Mihou and constructively\ncriticise the limitations of feature-level adversarial defences.",

HT is a\nbackdoor attack that tampers with the design of victim integrated circuits\n(ICs). AdaTest improves the existing HT detection techniques in terms of\nscalability and accuracy of detecting smaller Trojans in the presence of noise\nand variations. To achieve high trigger coverage, AdaTest leverages\nReinforcement Learning (RL) to produce a diverse set of test inputs.\nParticularly, we progressively generate test vectors with high reward values in\nan iterative manner. In each iteration, the test set is evaluated and\nadaptively expanded as needed. Furthermore, AdaTest integrates adaptive\nsampling to prioritize test samples that provide more information for HT\ndetection, thus reducing the number of samples while improving the sample\nquality for faster exploration. We develop AdaTest with a Software/Hardware\nco-design principle and provide an optimized on-chip architecture solution.\nAdaTest's architecture minimizes the hardware overhead in two ways:(i)\nDeploying circuit emulation on programmable hardware to accelerate reward\nevaluation of the test input; (ii) Pipelining each computation stage in AdaTest\nby automatically constructing auxiliary circuit for test input generation,\nreward evaluation, and adaptive sampling. We evaluate AdaTest's performance on\nvarious HT benchmarks and compare it with two prior works that use logic\ntesting for HT detection.

To leverage these\nrepresentations for image generation, we propose a two-stage model: a prior\nthat generates a CLIP image embedding given a text caption, and a decoder that\ngenerates an image conditioned on the image embedding. We show that explicitly\ngenerating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in\nphotorealism and caption similarity. Our decoders conditioned on image\nrepresentations can also produce variations of an image that preserve both its\nsemantics and style, while varying the non-essential details absent from the\nimage representation. Moreover, the joint embedding space of CLIP enables\nlanguage-guided image manipulations in a zero-shot fashion. We use diffusion\nmodels for the decoder and experiment with both autoregressive and diffusion\nmodels for the prior, finding that the latter are computationally more\nefficient and produce higher-quality samples.",

    "abstract": "Graph mining tasks arise from many different application domains, ranging\nfrom social networks, transportation, E-commerce, etc., which have been\nreceiving great attention from the theoretical and algorithm design communities\nin recent years, and there has been some pioneering work using the hotly\nresearched reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to address graph data mining\ntasks. However, these graph mining algorithms and RL models are dispersed in\ndifferent research areas, which makes it hard to compare different algorithms\nwith each other. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of RL\nmodels and graph mining and generalize these algorithms to Graph Reinforcement\nLearning (GRL) as a unified formulation. We further discuss the applications of\nGRL methods across various domains and summarize the method description,\nopen-source codes, and benchmark datasets of GRL methods. Finally, we propose\npossible important directions and challenges to be solved in the future. This\nis the latest work on a comprehensive survey of GRL literature, and this work\nprovides a global view for researchers as well as a learning resource for\nresearchers outside the domain.

    "abstract": "Video conferencing apps (VCAs) make it possible for previously private spaces\n-- bedrooms, living rooms, and kitchens -- into semi-public extensions of the\noffice. For the most part, users have accepted these apps in their personal\nspace without much thought about the permission models that govern the use of\ntheir private data during meetings. While access to a device's video camera is\ncarefully controlled, little has been done to ensure the same level of privacy\nfor accessing the microphone. In this work, we ask the question: what happens\nto the microphone data when a user clicks the mute button in a VCA? We first\nconduct a user study to analyze users' understanding of the permission model of\nthe mute button. Then, using runtime binary analysis tools, we trace raw audio\nflow in many popular VCAs as it traverses the app from the audio driver to the\nnetwork. We find fragmented policies for dealing with microphone data among\nVCAs -- some continuously monitor the microphone input during mute, and others\ndo so periodically. One app transmits statistics of the audio to its telemetry\nservers while the app is muted. Using network traffic that we intercept en\nroute to the telemetry server, we implement a proof-of-concept background\nactivity classifier and demonstrate the feasibility of inferring the ongoing\nbackground activity during a meeting -- cooking, cleaning, typing, etc. We\nachieved 81.9% macro accuracy on identifying six common background activities\nusing intercepted outgoing telemetry packets when a user is muted.",

However, many of such models come with a dauntingly huge size that\nfew institutions can afford to pre-train, fine-tune or even deploy, while\nmoderate-sized models usually lack strong generalized few-shot learning\ncapabilities. In this paper, we first elaborate the current obstacles of using\nPLM models in terms of the Impossible Triangle: 1) moderate model size, 2)\nstate-of-the-art few-shot learning capability, and 3) state-of-the-art\nfine-tuning capability.

To remedy these missing properties of\nPLMs, various techniques have been proposed, such as knowledge distillation,\ndata augmentation and prompt learning, which inevitably brings additional work\nto the application of PLMs in real scenarios.

    "abstract": "A number of key scientific computing applications that are based upon\ntensor-product grid constructions, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP)\nand combustion simulations, require property-preserving interpolation.\nEssentially Non-Oscillatory (ENO) interpolation is a classic example of such\ninterpolation schemes. In the aforementioned application areas, property\npreservation often manifests itself as a requirement for either data\nboundedness or positivity preservation. For example, in NWP, one may have to\ninterpolate between the grid on which the dynamics is calculated to a grid on\nwhich the physics is calculated (and back). Interpolating density or other key\nphysical quantities without accounting for property preservation may lead to\nnegative values that are nonphysical and result in inaccurate representations\nand/or interpretations of the physical data. Property-preserving interpolation\nis straightforward when used in the context of low-order numerical simulation\nmethods. High-order property-preserving interpolation is, however, nontrivial,\nespecially in the case where the interpolation points are not equispaced. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to construct high-order\ninterpolation methods that ensure either data boundedness or constrained\npositivity preservation. A novel feature of the algorithm is that the\npositivity-preserving interpolant is constrained; that is, the amount by which\nit exceeds the data values may be strictly controlled. The algorithm we have\ndeveloped comes with theoretical estimates that provide sufficient conditions\nfor data boundedness and constrained positivity preservation. We demonstrate\nthe application of our algorithm on a collection of 1D and 2D numerical\nexamples, and show that in all cases property preservation is respected.",

One key challenge is to ensure CAVs can reliably perceive other\nagents, especially occluded ones.

An SSTA is a statically-mounted camera that overlooks an\nintersection or area of complex traffic flow that predicts traffic flow as\nfuture video frames and learns to communicate with neighboring SSTAs to enable\npredicting traffic before it appears in the Field of View (FOV). The proposed\nframework aims at three goals: (1) inter-device communication to enable\nhigh-quality predictions, (2) scalability to an arbitrary number of devices,\nand (3) lifelong online learning to ensure adaptability to changing\ncircumstances.

    "abstract": "Today's robots often interface data-driven perception and planning models\nwith classical model-based controllers. For example, drones often use computer\nvision models to estimate navigation waypoints that are tracked by model\npredictive control (MPC). Often, such learned perception/planning models\nproduce erroneous waypoint predictions on out-of-distribution (OoD) or even\nadversarial visual inputs, which increase control cost. However, today's\nmethods to train robust perception models are largely task-agnostic - they\naugment a dataset using random image transformations or adversarial examples\ntargeted at the vision model in isolation. As such, they often introduce pixel\nperturbations that are ultimately benign for control, while missing those that\nare most adversarial. In contrast to prior work that synthesizes adversarial\nexamples for single-step vision tasks, our key contribution is to efficiently\nsynthesize adversarial scenarios for multi-step, model-based control. To do so,\nwe leverage differentiable MPC methods to calculate the sensitivity of a\nmodel-based controller to errors in state estimation, which in turn guides how\nwe synthesize adversarial inputs. We show that re-training vision models on\nthese adversarial datasets improves control performance on OoD test scenarios\nby up to 28.2% compared to standard task-agnostic data augmentation. Our system\nis tested on examples of robotic navigation and vision-based control of an\nautonomous air vehicle.",

    "abstract": "k-Nearest-Neighbor Machine Translation (kNN-MT) has been recently proposed as\na non-parametric solution for domain adaptation in neural machine translation\n(NMT). It aims to alleviate the performance degradation of advanced MT systems\nin translating out-of-domain sentences by coordinating with an additional\ntoken-level feature-based retrieval module constructed from in-domain data.\nPrevious studies have already demonstrated that non-parametric NMT is even\nsuperior to models fine-tuned on out-of-domain data. In spite of this success,\nkNN retrieval is at the expense of high latency, in particular for large\ndatastores. To make it practical, in this paper, we explore a more efficient\nkNN-MT and propose to use clustering to improve the retrieval efficiency.\nConcretely, we first propose a cluster-based Compact Network for feature\nreduction in a contrastive learning manner to compress context features into\n90+% lower dimensional vectors. We then suggest a cluster-based pruning\nsolution to filter out 10%-40% redundant nodes in large datastores while\nretaining translation quality. Our proposed methods achieve better or\ncomparable performance while reducing up to 57% inference latency against the\nadvanced non-parametric MT model on several machine translation benchmarks.\nExperimental results indicate that the proposed methods maintain the most\nuseful information of the original datastore and the Compact Network shows good\ngeneralization on unseen domains.",

    "abstract": "Dialog Act (DA) reveals the general intent of the speaker utterance in a\nconversation. Accurately predicting DAs can greatly facilitate the development\nof dialog agents. Although researchers have done extensive research on dialog\nact classification, the feature information of classification has not been\nfully considered. This paper suggests that word cues, part-of-speech cues and\nstatistical cues can complement each other to improve the basis for\nrecognition. In addition, the different types of the three lead to the\ndiversity of their distribution forms, which hinders the mining of feature\ninformation. To solve this problem, we propose a novel model based on\nuniversality and individuality strategies, called Universality-Individuality\nIntegration Model (UIIM). UIIM not only deepens the connection between the\nclues by learning universality, but also utilizes the learning of individuality\nto capture the characteristics of the clues themselves.

    "abstract": "Assuming the source label space subsumes the target one, Partial Video Domain\nAdaptation (PVDA) is a more general and practical scenario for cross-domain\nvideo classification problems. The key challenge of PVDA is to mitigate the\nnegative transfer caused by the source-only outlier classes. To tackle this\nchallenge, a crucial step is to aggregate target predictions to assign class\nweights by up-weighing target classes and down-weighing outlier classes.\nHowever, the incorrect predictions of class weights can mislead the network and\nlead to negative transfer. Previous works improve the class weight accuracy by\nutilizing temporal features and attention mechanisms, but these methods may\nfall short when trying to generate accurate class weight when domain shifts are\nsignificant, as in most real-world scenarios. To deal with these challenges, we\npropose the Multi-modality Cluster-calibrated partial Adversarial Network\n(MCAN). MCAN enhances video feature extraction with multi-modal features from\nmultiple temporal scales to form more robust overall features. It utilizes a\nnovel class weight calibration method to alleviate the negative transfer caused\nby incorrect class weights. The calibration method tries to identify and weigh\ncorrect and incorrect predictions using distributional information implied by\nunsupervised clustering.

However, previous data-end defenses show low generalization\nagainst diverse noises and weak transferability across multiple models.\nMotivated by the fact that robust recognition depends on both local and global\nfeatures, we propose a defensive patch generation framework to address these\nproblems by helping models better exploit these features. For the\ngeneralization against diverse noises, we inject class-specific identifiable\npatterns into a confined local patch prior, so that defensive patches could\npreserve more recognizable features towards specific classes, leading models\nfor better recognition under noises. For the transferability across multiple\nmodels, we guide the defensive patches to capture more global feature\ncorrelations within a class, so that they could activate model-shared global\nperceptions and transfer better among models. Our defensive patches show great\npotentials to improve application robustness in practice by simply sticking\nthem around target objects.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have been efficient lately on image parsing tasks.\nHowever, deep learning models are not fully capable of exploiting visual and\ncontextual information simultaneously. The proposed three-layer context-based\ndeep architecture is capable of integrating context explicitly with visual\ninformation. The novel idea here is to have a visual layer to learn visual\ncharacteristics from binary class-based learners, a contextual layer to learn\ncontext, and then an integration layer to learn from both via genetic\nalgorithm-based optimal fusion to produce a final decision. The experimental\noutcomes when evaluated on benchmark datasets are promising. Further analysis\nshows that optimized network weights can improve performance and make stable\npredictions.",

As mind-boggling amounts of data are\nproduced online daily, accelerating CTR prediction model training is critical\nto ensuring an up-to-date model and reducing the training cost. One approach to\nincrease the training speed is to apply large batch training. However, as shown\nin computer vision and natural language processing tasks, training with a large\nbatch easily suffers from the loss of accuracy. Our experiments show that\nprevious scaling rules fail in the training of CTR prediction neural networks.\nTo tackle this problem, we first theoretically show that different frequencies\nof ids make it challenging to scale hyperparameters when scaling the batch\nsize. To stabilize the training process in a large batch size setting, we\ndevelop the adaptive Column-wise Clipping (CowClip). It enables an easy and\neffective scaling rule for the embeddings, which keeps the learning rate\nunchanged and scales the L2 loss. We conduct extensive experiments with four\nCTR prediction networks on two real-world datasets and successfully scaled 128\ntimes the original batch size without accuracy loss. In particular, for CTR\nprediction model DeepFM training on the Criteo dataset, our optimization\nframework enlarges the batch size from 1K to 128K with over 0.1% AUC\nimprovement and reduces training time from 12 hours to 10 minutes on a single\nV100 GPU.

    "abstract": "Model stealing attacks have been successfully used in many machine learning\ndomains, but there is little understanding of how these attacks work in the\nmalware detection domain. Malware detection and, in general, security domains\nhave very strong requirements of low false positive rates (FPR). However, these\nrequirements are not the primary focus of the existing model stealing\nliterature. Stealing attacks create surrogate models that perform similarly to\na target model using a limited amount of queries to the target. The first stage\nof this study is the evaluation of active learning model stealing attacks\nagainst publicly available stand-alone machine learning malware classifiers and\nantivirus products (AVs). We propose a new neural network architecture for\nsurrogate models that outperforms the existing state of the art on low FPR\nconditions. The surrogates were evaluated on their agreement with the targeted\nmodels. Good surrogates of the stand-alone classifiers were created with up to\n99% agreement with the target models, using less than 4% of the original\ntraining dataset size. Good AV surrogates were also possible to train, but with\na lower agreement. The second stage used the best surrogates as well as the\ntarget models to generate adversarial malware using the MAB framework to test\nstand-alone models and AVs (offline and online). Results showed that surrogate\nmodels could generate adversarial samples that evade the targets but are less\nsuccessful than the targets themselves. Using surrogates, however, is a\nnecessity for attackers, given that attacks against AVs are extremely\ntime-consuming and easily detected when the AVs are connected to the internet.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing goal in robotics is to build robots that can perform a wide\nrange of daily tasks from perceptions obtained with their onboard sensors and\nspecified only via natural language. While recently substantial advances have\nbeen achieved in language-driven robotics by leveraging end-to-end learning\nfrom pixels, there is no clear and well-understood process for making various\ndesign choices due to the underlying variation in setups. In this paper, we\nconduct an extensive study of the most critical challenges in learning language\nconditioned policies from offline free-form imitation datasets. We further\nidentify architectural and algorithmic techniques that improve performance,\nsuch as a hierarchical decomposition of the robot control learning, a\nmultimodal transformer encoder, discrete latent plans and a self-supervised\ncontrastive loss that aligns video and language representations. By combining\nthe results of our investigation with our improved model components, we are\nable to present a novel approach that significantly outperforms the state of\nthe art on the challenging language conditioned long-horizon robot manipulation\nCALVIN benchmark.

    "abstract": "Many software systems today face uncertain operating conditions, such as\nsudden changes in the availability of resources or unexpected user behavior.\nWithout proper mitigation these uncertainties can jeopardize the system goals.\nSelf-adaptation is a common approach to tackle such uncertainties. When the\nsystem goals may be compromised, the self-adaptive system has to select the\nbest adaptation option to reconfigure by analyzing the possible adaptation\noptions, i.e., the adaptation space. Yet, analyzing large adaptation spaces\nusing rigorous methods can be resource- and time-consuming, or even be\ninfeasible. One approach to tackle this problem is by using online machine\nlearning to reduce adaptation spaces. However, existing approaches require\ndomain expertise to perform feature engineering to define the learner, and\nsupport online adaptation space reduction only for specific goals. To tackle\nthese limitations, we present 'Deep Learning for Adaptation Space Reduction\nPlus' -- DLASeR+ in short. DLASeR+ offers an extendable learning framework for\nonline adaptation space reduction that does not require feature engineering,\nwhile supporting three common types of adaptation goals: threshold,\noptimization, and set-point goals. We evaluate DLASeR+ on two instances of an\nInternet-of-Things application with increasing sizes of adaptation spaces for\ndifferent combinations of adaptation goals. We compare DLASeR+ with a baseline\nthat applies exhaustive analysis and two state-of-the-art approaches for\nadaptation space reduction that rely on learning. Results show that DLASeR+ is\neffective with a negligible effect on the realization of the adaptation goals\ncompared to an exhaustive analysis approach, and supports three common types of\nadaptation goals beyond the state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "Numerical codes that require arbitrary precision floating point (APFP)\nnumbers for their core computation are dominated by elementary arithmetic\noperations due to the super-linear complexity of multiplication in the number\nof mantissa bits. APFP computations on conventional software-based\narchitectures are made exceedingly expensive by the lack of native hardware\nsupport, requiring elementary operations to be emulated using instructions\noperating on machine-word-sized blocks. In this work, we show how APFP\nmultiplication on compile-time fixed-precision operands can be implemented as\ndeep FPGA pipelines with a recursively defined Karatsuba decomposition on top\nof native DSP multiplication. When comparing our design implemented on an Alveo\nU250 accelerator to a dual-socket 36-core Xeon node running the GNU Multiple\nPrecision Floating-Point Reliable (MPFR) library, we achieve a 9.8x speedup at\n4.8 GOp/s for 512-bit multiplication, and a 5.3x speedup at 1.2 GOp/s for\n1024-bit multiplication, corresponding to the throughput of more than 351x and\n191x CPU cores, respectively. We apply this architecture to general\nmatrix-matrix multiplication, yielding a 10x speedup at 2.0 GOp/s over the Xeon\nnode, equivalent to more than 375x CPU cores, effectively allowing a single\nFPGA to replace a small CPU cluster.

    "abstract": "The problem of the optimal allocation (in the expected mean square error\nsense) of a measurement budget for particle filtering is addressed. We propose\nthree different optimal intermittent filters, whose optimality criteria depend\non the information available at the time of decision making. For the first, the\nstochastic program filter, the measurement times are given by a policy that\ndetermines whether a measurement should be taken based on the measurements\nalready acquired. The second, called the offline filter, determines all\nmeasurement times at once by solving a combinatorial optimization program\nbefore any measurement acquisition. For the third one, which we call online\nfilter, each time a new measurement is received, the next measurement time is\nrecomputed to take all the information that is then available into account. We\nprove that in terms of expected mean square error, the stochastic program\nfilter outperforms the online filter, which itself outperforms the offline\nfilter. However, these filters are generally intractable. For this reason, the\nfilter estimate is approximated by a particle filter. Moreover, the mean square\nerror is approximated using a Monte-Carlo approach, and different optimization\nalgorithms are compared to approximately solve the combinatorial programs (a\nrandom trial algorithm, greedy forward and backward algorithms, a simulated\nannealing algorithm, and a genetic algorithm). Finally, the performance of the\nproposed methods is illustrated on two examples: a tumor motion model and a\ncommon benchmark for particle filtering.",

    "abstract": "3D visual grounding aims to locate the referred target object in 3D point\ncloud scenes according to a free-form language description. Previous methods\nmostly follow a two-stage paradigm, i.e., language-irrelevant detection and\ncross-modal matching, which is limited by the isolated architecture. In such a\nparadigm, the detector needs to sample keypoints from raw point clouds due to\nthe inherent properties of 3D point clouds (irregular and large-scale), to\ngenerate the corresponding object proposal for each keypoint. However, sparse\nproposals may leave out the target in detection, while dense proposals may\nconfuse the matching model. Moreover, the language-irrelevant detection stage\ncan only sample a small proportion of keypoints on the target, deteriorating\nthe target prediction. In this paper, we propose a 3D Single-Stage Referred\nPoint Progressive Selection (3D-SPS) method, which progressively selects\nkeypoints with the guidance of language and directly locates the target.\nSpecifically, we propose a Description-aware Keypoint Sampling (DKS) module to\ncoarsely focus on the points of language-relevant objects, which are\nsignificant clues for grounding. Besides, we devise a Target-oriented\nProgressive Mining (TPM) module to finely concentrate on the points of the\ntarget, which is enabled by progressive intra-modal relation modeling and\ninter-modal target mining. 3D-SPS bridges the gap between detection and\nmatching in the 3D visual grounding task, localizing the target at a single\nstage.

    "abstract": "The homogeneity of filter media is important for material selection and\nquality control, along with the specific weight (nominal grammage) and the\ndistribution of the local weight. Cloudiness or formation is a concept used to\ndescribe deviations from homogeneity in filter media. We suggest to derive the\ncloudiness index from the power spectrum of the relative local areal weight,\nintegrated over a selected frequency range. The power spectrum captures the\nenergy density in a broad spectral range. Moreover, under certain conditions,\nthe structure of a nonwoven is fully characterized by the areal weight, the\nvariance of the local areal weight, and the power spectrum. Consequently, the\npower spectrum is the parameter that exclusively reflects the cloudiness. Here,\nwe address questions arising from practical application. The most prominent is\nthe choice of the spectral band. It certainly depends on the characteristic\n\"size of the clouds\", but is limited by the size and lateral resolution of the\nimages. We show that the cloudiness index based on the power spectrum of the\nrelative local areal weight is theoretically well founded and can be robustly\nmeasured from image data. Choosing the spectral band allows to capture the\ncloudiness either visually perceived or found to be decisive for product\nproperties. It is thus well suited to build a technical standard on it.",

While the LEO\nedge is merely theoretical at the moment, providers are expected to rapidly\ndevelop their satellite technologies to keep the upper hand in the new space\nrace.\nIn this paper, we answer the question of how researchers can explore the\npossibilities of LEO edge computing and evaluate arbitrary software systems in\nan accurate runtime environment and with cost-efficient scalability. To that\nend, we present Celestial, a virtual testbed for the LEO edge based on\nmicroVMs. Celestial can efficiently emulate individual satellites and their\nmovement as well as ground station servers with realistic network conditions\nand in an application-agnostic manner, which we show empirically. Additionally,\nwe explore opportunities and implications of deploying a real-time remote\nsensing application on LEO edge infrastructure in a case study on Celestial.",

    "abstract": "In the age of large transformer language models, linguistic evaluation play\nan important role in diagnosing models' abilities and limitations on natural\nlanguage understanding. However, current evaluation methods show some\nsignificant shortcomings. In particular, they do not provide insight into how\nwell a language model captures distinct linguistic skills essential for\nlanguage understanding and reasoning. Thus they fail to effectively map out the\naspects of language understanding that remain challenging to existing models,\nwhich makes it hard to discover potential limitations in models and datasets.\nIn this paper, we introduce Curriculum as a new format of NLI benchmark for\nevaluation of broad-coverage linguistic phenomena. Curriculum contains a\ncollection of datasets that covers 36 types of major linguistic phenomena and\nan evaluation procedure for diagnosing how well a language model captures\nreasoning skills for distinct types of linguistic phenomena. We show that this\nlinguistic-phenomena-driven benchmark can serve as an effective tool for\ndiagnosing model behavior and verifying model learning quality. In addition,\nOur experiments provide insight into the limitation of existing benchmark\ndatasets and state-of-the-art models that may encourage future research on\nre-designing datasets, model architectures, and learning objectives.",

In particular, the sensitive nature of the information in highly\nregulated scenarios needs to be accounted for. Specific approaches to address\nthe privacy issue have been developed, as Privacy Enhancing Technologies.\nHowever, they frequently cause loss of information, putting forward a crucial\ntrade-off among data quality and privacy. A clever way to bypass such a\nconundrum relies on Synthetic Data: data obtained from a generative process,\nlearning the real data properties. Both Academia and Industry realized the\nimportance of evaluating synthetic data quality: without all-round reliable\nmetrics, the innovative data generation task has no proper objective function\nto maximize. Despite that, the topic remains under-explored. For this reason,\nwe systematically catalog the important traits of synthetic data quality and\nprivacy, and devise a specific methodology to test them. The result is DAISYnt\n(aDoption of Artificial Intelligence SYnthesis): a comprehensive suite of\nadvanced tests, which sets a de facto standard for synthetic data evaluation.\nAs a practical use-case, a variety of generative algorithms have been trained\non real-world Credit Bureau Data. The best model has been assessed, using\nDAISYnt on the different synthetic replicas. Further potential uses, among\nothers, entail auditing and fine-tuning of generative models or ensuring high\nquality of a given synthetic dataset.

    "abstract": "Crack nucleation is crucial in many industrial applications. The phase field\nmethod for fracture transforms the crack nucleation problem into a minimization\nproblem of the sum of the elastic potential energy and the crack surface\nenergy. Due to the polyconvexity of the formulation, starting from a crackless\nsolid, a standard Newton iteration may lead to a solution with no crack, even\nthough a cracked solution has a lower total energy. As such, the critical load\nfor cracking is highly overestimated. Here, we propose an algorithm termed\n\"parallel universe\" algorithm to capture the global minimum. This algorithm has\ntwo key ingredients: (a) a necessary condition for cracking solely based on the\ncurrent crackless solution, and (b) beginning from when this condition is met,\nNewton iteration with two initial guesses, a crackles one and a cracked one,\nwill both be performed and the converged candidate solution with lower energy\nis accepted as the solution at that load step. Once the cracked candidate\nsolution is accepted, the crackless one is discarded, i.e., only one universe\nis retained. This cracked initial guess is obtained only once for all load\nsteps by solving a series of similar minimization problems with a progressively\nreduced critical crack energy release rate. Numerical examples with isotropic\nand anisotropic critical crack energy release rates indicate that the proposed\nalgorithm is more reliable (as there is no need to retrace) and more efficient\nthan the standard Newton iteration and a well-known backtracking algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Modelling biological or engineering swarms is challenging due to the\ninherently high dimension of the system, despite the often low-dimensional\nemergent dynamics. Most existing swarm modelling approaches are based on first\nprinciples and often result in swarm-specific parameterizations that do not\ngeneralize to a broad range of applications. In this work, we apply a purely\ndata-driven method to (1) learn local interactions of homogeneous swarms\nthrough observation data and to (2) generate similar swarming behaviour using\nthe learned model. In particular, a modified version of dynamic mode\ndecomposition with control, called swarmDMD, is developed and tested on the\ncanonical Vicsek swarm model. The goal is to use swarmDMD to learn inter-agent\ninteractions that give rise to the observed swarm behaviour. We show that\nswarmDMD can faithfully reconstruct the swarm dynamics, and the model learned\nby swarmDMD provides a short prediction window for data extrapolation with a\ntrade-off between prediction accuracy and prediction horizon. We also provide a\ncomprehensive analysis on the efficacy of different observation data types on\nthe modelling, where we find that inter-agent distance yields the most accurate\nmodels. We believe the proposed swarmDMD approach will be useful for studying\nmulti-agent systems found in biology, physics, and engineering.",

    "abstract": "The increasing complexity of low-voltage networks poses a growing challenge\nfor the reliable and fail-safe operation of electricity grids. The reasons for\nthis include an increasingly decentralized energy generation (photovoltaic\nsystems, wind power, etc.) and the emergence of new types of consumers\n(e-mobility, domestic electricity storage, etc.). At the same time, the\nlow-voltage grid is largely unmonitored and local power failures are sometimes\nhard to detect. To overcome this, power line communication (PLC) has emerged as\na potential solution for reliable monitoring of the low-voltage grid. In\naddition to establishing a communication infrastructure, PLC also offers the\npossibility of evaluating the cables themselves, as well as the connection\nquality between individual cable distributors based on their Signal-to-Noise\nRatio (SNR). The roll-out of a large-scale PLC infrastructure therefore not\nonly ensures communication, but also introduces a tool for monitoring the\nentire network. To evaluate the potential of this data, we installed 38 PLC\nmodems in three different areas of a German city with a population of about\n150,000 as part of the F\\\"uhler-im-Netz project. Over a period of 22 months, an\nSNR spectrum of each connection between adjacent PLC modems was generated every\nquarter of an hour. % and the voltage was measured every minute. The\navailability of this real-world PLC data opens up new possibilities to react to\nthe increasingly complex challenges in future smart grids. This paper provides\na detailed analysis of the data generation and describes how the data was\ncollected during normal operation of the electricity grid. In addition, we\npresent common anomalies, effects, and trends that could be observed in the PLC\ndata at daily, weekly, or seasonal levels. Finally, we discuss potential use\ncases and the remote inspection of a cable section is highlighted as an\nexample.",

    "abstract": "As machine learning models are deployed ever more broadly, it becomes\nincreasingly important that they are not only able to perform well on their\ntraining distribution, but also yield accurate predictions when confronted with\ndistribution shift. The Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) framework\nproposes to address this issue by training models to minimize their expected\nrisk under a collection of distributions, to imitate test-time shifts. This is\nmost commonly achieved by instance-level re-weighting of the training objective\nto emulate the likelihood ratio with possible test distributions, which allows\nfor estimating their empirical risk via importance sampling (assuming that they\nare subpopulations of the training distribution). However, re-weighting schemes\nin the literature are usually limited due to the difficulty of keeping the\noptimization problem tractable and the complexity of enforcing normalization\nconstraints. In this paper, we show that three simple ideas -- mini-batch level\nnormalization, a KL penalty and simultaneous gradient updates -- allow us to\ntrain models with DRO using a broader class of parametric likelihood ratios. In\na series of experiments on both image and text classification benchmarks, we\nfind that models trained with the resulting parametric adversaries are\nconsistently more robust to subpopulation shifts when compared to other DRO\napproaches, and that the method performs reliably well with little\nhyper-parameter tuning.

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, the acceleration of computing resources and research\nin deep learning has led to significant practical successes in a range of\ntasks, including in particular in computer vision. Building on these advances,\nreinforcement learning has also seen a leap forward with the emergence of\nagents capable of making decisions directly from visual observations. Despite\nthese successes, the over-parametrization of neural architectures leads to\nmemorization of the data used during training and thus to a lack of\ngeneralization. Reinforcement learning agents based on visual inputs also\nsuffer from this phenomenon by erroneously correlating rewards with unrelated\nvisual features such as background elements. To alleviate this problem, we\nintroduce a new regularization technique consisting of channel-consistent local\npermutations (CLOP) of the feature maps. The proposed permutations induce\nrobustness to spatial correlations and help prevent overfitting behaviors in\nRL. We demonstrate, on the OpenAI Procgen Benchmark, that RL agents trained\nwith the CLOP method exhibit robustness to visual changes and better\ngeneralization properties than agents trained using other state-of-the-art\nregularization techniques.

Our new encoding is\nbased on the insight that disjunction can be encoded using a logarithmic number\nof binary variables and conjunction can be encoded without binary variables. We\ndemonstrate in simulation examples that our proposed approach significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art for long and complex specifications.\nOpen-source software is available at https://stlpy.readthedocs.io .",

    "title": "Deep learning based automatic detection of offshore oil slicks using SAR  data and contextual information",
    "abstract": "Ocean surface monitoring, especially oil slick detection, has become\nmandatory due to its importance for oil exploration and risk prevention on\necosystems. For years, the detection task has been performed manually by\nphoto-interpreters using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images with the help of\ncontextual data such as wind. This tedious manual work cannot handle the\nincreasing amount of data collected by the available sensors and thus requires\nautomation. Literature reports conventional and semi-automated detection\nmethods that generally focus either on oil slicks originating from\nanthropogenic (spills) or natural (seeps) sources on limited data collections.\nAs an extension, this paper presents the automation of offshore oil slicks on\nan extensive database with both kinds of slicks. It builds upon the slick\nannotations of specialized photo-interpreters on Sentinel-1 SAR data for 4\nyears over 3 exploration and monitoring areas worldwide. All the considered SAR\nimages and related annotation relate to real oil slick monitoring scenarios.\nFurther, wind estimation is systematically computed to enrich the data\ncollection. Paper contributions are the following : (i) a performance\ncomparison of two deep learning approaches: semantic segmentation using\nFC-DenseNet and instance segmentation using Mask-RCNN. (ii) the introduction of\nmeteorological information (wind speed) is deemed valuable for oil slick\ndetection in the performance evaluation. The main results of this study show\nthe effectiveness of slick detection by deep learning approaches, in particular\nFC-DenseNet, which captures more than 92% of oil instances in our test set.\nFurthermore, a strong correlation between model performances and contextual\ninformation such as slick size and wind speed is demonstrated in the\nperformance evaluation. This work opens perspectives to design models that can\nfuse SAR and wind information to reduce the false alarm rate.",

    "abstract": "Landscape-aware algorithm selection approaches have so far mostly been\nrelying on landscape feature extraction as a preprocessing step, independent of\nthe execution of optimization algorithms in the portfolio. This introduces a\nsignificant overhead in computational cost for many practical applications, as\nfeatures are extracted and computed via sampling and evaluating the problem\ninstance at hand, similarly to what the optimization algorithm would perform\nanyway within its search trajectory. As suggested in Jankovic et al. (EvoAPPs\n2021), trajectory-based algorithm selection circumvents the problem of costly\nfeature extraction by computing landscape features from points that a solver\nsampled and evaluated during the optimization process. Features computed in\nthis manner are used to train algorithm performance regression models, upon\nwhich a per-run algorithm selector is then built.\nIn this work, we apply the trajectory-based approach onto a portfolio of five\nalgorithms. We study the quality and accuracy of performance regression and\nalgorithm selection models in the scenario of predicting different algorithm\nperformances after a fixed budget of function evaluations. We rely on landscape\nfeatures of the problem instance computed using one portion of the\naforementioned budget of the same function evaluations. Moreover, we consider\nthe possibility of switching between the solvers once, which requires them to\nbe warm-started, i.e. when we switch, the second solver continues the\noptimization process already being initialized appropriately by making use of\nthe information collected by the first solver. In this new context, we show\npromising performance of the trajectory-based per-run algorithm selection with\nwarm-starting.",

In conventional methods of SED for targeting a specific sound\nevent class, only information on types of target sound can be treated. To\nflexibly control more wealth of information on the target event, the proposed\nSET exploits not only types of target sound but also the extent to which each\ntarget sound is detected with priority. To implement SET, we apply a method\nthat allows the system input of the priority of sound events to be detected,\nwhich is based on the class-level loss-conditional training. Results of the\nexperiment using the URBAN--SED dataset reveal that our SET scheme achieves\nreasonable detection performance in terms of frame-based and intersection-based\nF-scores.

    "abstract": "Simulation software is a powerful tool for robotics research, allowing the\nvirtual representation of the real world. However with the rise of the Robot\nOperating System (ROS), there are new simulation software packages that have\nnot been compared within the literature. This paper proposes a systematic\nreview of simulation software that are compatible with ROS version 2. The focus\nis research in robotics arm manipulation as it represents the most often used\nrobotic application in industry and their future applicability to digital\ntwins. For this, we thus benchmark simulation software under similar\nparameters, tasks and scenarios, and evaluate them in terms of their capability\nfor long-term operations, success at completing a task, repeatability and\nresource usage. We find that there is no best simulation software overall, but\ntwo simulation packages (Ignition and Webots) have higher stability than other\nwhile, in terms of resources usage, PyBullet and Coppeliasim consume less than\ntheir competitors.",

    "abstract": "Weak supervision (WS) is an alternative to the traditional supervised\nlearning to address the need for ground truth. Data programming is a practical\nWS approach that allows programmatic labeling data samples using labeling\nfunctions (LFs) instead of hand-labeling each data point. However, the existing\napproach fails to fully exploit the domain knowledge encoded into LFs,\nespecially when the LFs' coverage is low. This is due to the common data\nprogramming pipeline that neglects to utilize data features during the\ngenerative process. This paper proposes a new approach called reinforced\nlabeling (RL). Given an unlabeled dataset and a set of LFs, RL augments the\nLFs' outputs to cases not covered by LFs based on similarities among samples.\nThus, RL can lead to higher labeling coverage for training an end classifier.\nThe experiments on several domains (classification of YouTube comments, wine\nquality, and weather prediction) result in considerable gains. The new approach\nproduces significant performance improvement, leading up to +21 points in\naccuracy and +61 points in F1 scores compared to the state-of-the-art data\nprogramming approach.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by a plethora of practical examples where bias is induced by\nautomated-decision making algorithms, there has been strong recent interest in\nthe design of fair algorithms. However, there is often a dichotomy between\nfairness and efficacy: fair algorithms may proffer low social welfare solutions\nwhereas welfare optimizing algorithms may be very unfair. This issue is\nexemplified in the machine scheduling problem where, for $n$ jobs, the social\nwelfare of any fair solution may be a factor $\\Omega(n)$ worse than the optimal\nwelfare. In this paper, we prove that this dichotomy between fairness and\nefficacy can be overcome if we allow for a negligible amount of bias: there\nexist algorithms that are both \"almost perfectly fair\" and have a constant\nfactor efficacy ratio, that is, are guaranteed to output solutions that have\nsocial welfare within a constant factor of optimal welfare. Specifically, for\nany $\\epsilon>0$, there exist mechanisms with efficacy ratio\n$\\Theta(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$ and where no agent is more than an $\\epsilon$\nfraction worse off than they are in the fairest possible solution (given by an\nalgorithm that does not use personal or type data). Moreover, these bicriteria\nguarantees are tight and apply to both the single machine case and the multiple\nmachine case. The key to our results are the use of Pareto scheduling\nmechanisms. These mechanisms, by the judicious use of personal or type data,\nare able to exploit Pareto improvements that benefit every individual; such\nPareto improvements would typically be forbidden by fair scheduling algorithms\ndesigned to satisfy standard statistical measures of group fairness. We\nanticipate this paradigm, the judicious use of personal data by a fair\nalgorithm to greatly improve performance at the cost of negligible bias, has\nwider application.",

A cross-lingual\nadjustment of these models using a small parallel corpus can potentially\nfurther improve results. This is a more data efficient method compared to\ntraining a machine-translation system or a multi-lingual model from scratch\nusing only parallel data. In this study, we experiment with zero-shot transfer\nof English models to four typologically different languages (Spanish, Russian,\nVietnamese, and Hindi) and three NLP tasks (QA, NLI, and NER). We carry out a\ncross-lingual adjustment of an off-the-shelf mBERT model. We confirm prior\nfinding that this adjustment makes embeddings of semantically similar words\nfrom different languages closer to each other, while keeping unrelated words\napart. However, from the paired-differences histograms introduced in our work\nwe can see that the adjustment only modestly affects the relative distances\nbetween related and unrelated words. In contrast, fine-tuning of mBERT on\nEnglish data (for a specific task such as NER) draws embeddings of both related\nand unrelated words closer to each other. The cross-lingual adjustment of mBERT\nimproves NLI in four languages and NER in two languages, while QA performance\nnever improves and sometimes degrades. When we fine-tune a cross-lingual\nadjusted mBERT for a specific task (e.g., NLI), the cross-lingual adjustment of\nmBERT may still improve the separation between related and related words, but\nthis works consistently only for the XNLI task.

    "abstract": "Modularity in robotics holds great potential. In principle, modular robots\ncan be disassembled and reassembled in different robots, and possibly perform\nnew tasks. Nevertheless, actually exploiting modularity is yet an unsolved\nproblem: controllers usually rely on inter-module communication, a practical\nrequirement that makes modules not perfectly interchangeable and thus limits\ntheir flexibility. Here, we focus on Voxel-based Soft Robots (VSRs),\naggregations of mechanically identical elastic blocks. We use the same neural\ncontroller inside each voxel, but without any inter-voxel communication, hence\nenabling ideal conditions for modularity: modules are all equal and\ninterchangeable. We optimize the parameters of the neural controller-shared\namong the voxels-by evolutionary computation. Crucially, we use a local\nself-attention mechanism inside the controller to overcome the absence of\ninter-module communication channels, thus enabling our robots to truly be\ndriven by the collective intelligence of their modules. We show experimentally\nthat the evolved robots are effective in the task of locomotion: thanks to\nself-attention, instances of the same controller embodied in the same robot can\nfocus on different inputs. We also find that the evolved controllers generalize\nto unseen morphologies, after a short fine-tuning, suggesting that an inductive\nbias related to the task arises from true modularity.",

One of the\nmost effective approaches to adapt to a new language is language adaptive\nfine-tuning (LAFT) -- fine-tuning a multilingual PLM on monolingual texts of a\nlanguage using the same pre-training objective. However, African languages with\nlarge monolingual texts are few, and adapting to each of them individually\ntakes large disk space and limits the cross-lingual transfer abilities of the\nresulting models because they have been specialized for a single language. In\nthis paper, we perform multilingual adaptive fine-tuning (MAFT) on 17\nmost-resourced African languages and three other high-resource languages widely\nspoken on the African continent -- English, French, and Arabic to encourage\ncross-lingual transfer learning. Additionally, to further specialize the\nmultilingual PLM, we removed vocabulary tokens from the embedding layer that\ncorresponds to non-African writing scripts before MAFT, thus reducing the model\nsize by around 50\\%. Our evaluation on two multilingual PLMs (AfriBERTa and\nXLM-R) and three NLP tasks (NER, news topic classification, and sentiment\nclassification) shows that our approach is competitive to applying LAFT on\nindividual languages while requiring significantly less disk space. Finally, we\nshow that our adapted PLM also improves the zero-shot cross-lingual transfer\nabilities of parameter efficient fine-tuning methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel numerical method for the Newton seismic\nfull-waveform inversion (FWI). The method is based on the full-space approach,\nwhere the state, adjoint state, and control variables are optimized\nsimultaneously. Each Newton step is formulated as a PDE-constrained\noptimization problem, which is cast in the form of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)\nsystem of linear algebraic equitations. The KKT system is solved inexactly with\na preconditioned Krylov solver. We introduced two preconditioners: the one\nbased on the block-triangular factorization and its variant with an inexact\nblock solver. The method was benchmarked against the standard truncated Newton\nFWI scheme on a part of the Marmousi velocity model. The algorithm demonstrated\na considerable runtime reduction compared to the standard FWI. Moreover, the\npresented approach has a great potential for further acceleration. The central\nresult of this paper is that it establishes the feasibility of Newton-type\noptimization of the KKT system in application to the seismic FWI.",

Trial sites, where the trials are conducted, are\nchosen mainly based on feasibility in terms of medical expertise and access to\na large group of patients. More recently, the issue of diversity and inclusion\nin clinical trials is gaining importance. Different patient groups may\nexperience the effects of a medical drug/ treatment differently and hence need\nto be included in the clinical trials. These groups could be based on\nethnicity, co-morbidities, age, or economic factors. Thus, designing a method\nfor trial site selection that accounts for both feasibility and diversity is a\ncrucial and urgent goal. In this paper, we formulate this problem as a ranking\nproblem with fairness constraints. Using principles of fairness in machine\nlearning, we learn a model that maps a clinical trial description to a ranked\nlist of potential trial sites. Unlike existing fairness frameworks, the group\nmembership of each trial site is non-binary: each trial site may have access to\npatients from multiple groups. We propose fairness criteria based on\ndemographic parity to address such a multi-group membership scenario. We test\nour method on 480 real-world clinical trials and show that our model results in\na list of potential trial sites that provides access to a diverse set of\npatients while also ensuing a high number of enrolled patients.",

FactGraph encodes such graphs using a graph encoder\naugmented with structure-aware adapters to capture interactions among the\nconcepts based on the graph connectivity, along with text representations using\nan adapter-based text encoder. Experiments on different benchmarks for\nevaluating factuality show that FactGraph outperforms previous approaches by up\nto 15%.

This\nis especially the case for autonomous vehicles (AVs) navigating real-world\nsituations where safety is paramount, and a strong ability to react to a\nchanging belief about the environment is truly needed.\nIn this paper we explore an end-to-end approach, from training to execution,\nfor learning robust contingency plans and combining them with a hierarchical\nplanner to obtain a robust agent policy in an autonomous navigation task where\nother vehicles' behaviours are unknown, and the agent's belief about these\nbehaviours is subject to sudden, last-second change.

However, accurate\nrecommendation requires a vast amount of historical check-in data, thus\nthreatening user privacy as the location-sensitive data needs to be handled by\ncloud servers. Although there have been several on-device frameworks for\nprivacy-preserving POI recommendations, they are still resource-intensive when\nit comes to storage and computation, and show limited robustness to the high\nsparsity of user-POI interactions. On this basis, we propose a novel\ndecentralized collaborative learning framework for POI recommendation (DCLR),\nwhich allows users to train their personalized models locally in a\ncollaborative manner. DCLR significantly reduces the local models' dependence\non the cloud for training, and can be used to expand arbitrary centralized\nrecommendation models. To counteract the sparsity of on-device user data when\nlearning each local model, we design two self-supervision signals to pretrain\nthe POI representations on the server with geographical and categorical\ncorrelations of POIs. To facilitate collaborative learning, we innovatively\npropose to incorporate knowledge from either geographically or semantically\nsimilar users into each local model with attentive aggregation and mutual\ninformation maximization.

    "abstract": "In sparse recommender settings, users' context and item attributes play a\ncrucial role in deciding which items to recommend next. Despite that, recent\nworks in sequential and time-aware recommendations usually either ignore both\naspects or only consider one of them, limiting their predictive performance. In\nthis paper, we address these limitations by proposing a context and\nattribute-aware recommender model (CARCA) that can capture the dynamic nature\nof the user profiles in terms of contextual features and item attributes via\ndedicated multi-head self-attention blocks that extract profile-level features\nand predicting item scores. Also, unlike many of the current state-of-the-art\nsequential item recommendation approaches that use a simple dot-product between\nthe most recent item's latent features and the target items embeddings for\nscoring, CARCA uses cross-attention between all profile items and the target\nitems to predict their final scores. This cross-attention allows CARCA to\nharness the correlation between old and recent items in the user profile and\ntheir influence on deciding which item to recommend next. Experiments on four\nreal-world recommender system datasets show that the proposed model\nsignificantly outperforms all state-of-the-art models in the task of item\nrecommendation and achieving improvements of up to 53% in Normalized Discounted\nCumulative Gain (NDCG) and Hit-Ratio. Results also show that CARCA outperformed\nseveral state-of-the-art dedicated image-based recommender systems by merely\nutilizing image attributes extracted from a pre-trained ResNet50 in a black-box\nfashion.",

    "abstract": "How to effectively sample high-quality negative instances is important for\nwell training a recommendation model. We argue that a high-quality negative\nshould be both \\textit{informativeness} and \\textit{unbiasedness}. Although\nprevious studies have proposed some approaches to address the informativeness\nin negative sampling, few has been done to discriminating false negative from\ntrue negative for unbiased negative sampling, not to mention taking both into\nconsideration. This paper first adopts a parameter learning perspective to\nanalyze negative informativeness and unbiasedness in loss gradient-based model\ntraining. We argue that both negative sampling and collaborative filtering\ninclude an implicit task of negative classification, from which we report an\ninsightful yet beneficial finding about the order relation in predicted\nnegatives' scores. Based on our finding and by regarding negatives as random\nvariables, we next derive the class condition density of true negatives and\nthat of false negatives. We also design a Bayesian classifier for negative\nclassification, from which we define a quantitative unbiasedness measure for\nnegatives. Finally, we propose to use a harmonic mean of informativeness and\nunbiasedness to sample high-quality negatives. Experimental studies validate\nthe superiority of our negative sampling algorithm over the peers in terms of\nbetter sampling quality and better recommendation performance.",

    "abstract": "There is growing interest in designing recommender systems that aim at being\nfair towards item producers or their least satisfied users. Inspired by the\ndomain of inequality measurement in economics, this paper explores the use of\ngeneralized Gini welfare functions (GGFs) as a means to specify the normative\ncriterion that recommender systems should optimize for. GGFs weight individuals\ndepending on their ranks in the population, giving more weight to worse-off\nindividuals to promote equality. Depending on these weights, GGFs minimize the\nGini index of item exposure to promote equality between items, or focus on the\nperformance on specific quantiles of least satisfied users. GGFs for ranking\nare challenging to optimize because they are non-differentiable. We resolve\nthis challenge by leveraging tools from non-smooth optimization and projection\noperators used in differentiable sorting. We present experiments using real\ndatasets with up to 15k users and items, which show that our approach obtains\nbetter trade-offs than the baselines on a variety of recommendation tasks and\nfairness criteria.",

    "abstract": "Query understanding plays a key role in exploring users' search intents and\nfacilitating users to locate their most desired information. However, it is\ninherently challenging since it needs to capture semantic information from\nshort and ambiguous queries and often requires massive task-specific labeled\ndata. In recent years, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have advanced various\nnatural language processing tasks because they can extract general semantic\ninformation from large-scale corpora. Therefore, there are unprecedented\nopportunities to adopt PLMs for query understanding. However, there is a gap\nbetween the goal of query understanding and existing pre-training strategies --\nthe goal of query understanding is to boost search performance while existing\nstrategies rarely consider this goal. Thus, directly applying them to query\nunderstanding is sub-optimal. On the other hand, search logs contain user\nclicks between queries and urls that provide rich users' search behavioral\ninformation on queries beyond their content. Therefore, in this paper, we aim\nto fill this gap by exploring search logs. In particular, to incorporate search\nlogs into pre-training, we first construct a query graph where nodes are\nqueries and two queries are connected if they lead to clicks on the same urls.\nThen we propose a novel graph-enhanced pre-training framework, GE-BERT, which\ncan leverage both query content and the query graph. In other words, GE-BERT\ncan capture both the semantic information and the users' search behavioral\ninformation of queries. Extensive experiments on various query understanding\ntasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

In this approach, we need to decide when a switch\nshould take place and which algorithm to pick for the switching. Intuitively,\nthis approach chains the algorithms for combining the well-performing segments\nfrom the performance profile of the algorithms. To realize efficient chaining,\nwe investigate two important aspects - how the switching point influences the\noverall performance and how to warm-start an algorithm with information stored\nin its predecessor. To delve into those aspects, we manually construct a\nportfolio comprising five state-of-the-art optimization algorithms and only\nconsider a single switch between each algorithm pair. After benchmarking those\nalgorithms with the BBOB problem set, we choose the switching point for each\npair by maximizing the theoretical performance gain. The theoretical gain is\ncompared to the actual gain obtained by executing the switching procedure with\nthe corresponding switching point. Moreover, we devise algorithm-specific\nwarm-starting methods for initializing the algorithm after the switching with\nthe information learned from its predecessor. Our empirical results show that\non some BBOB problems, the theoretical gain is realized or even surpassed by\nthe actual gain. More importantly, this approach discovers a chain that\noutperforms the single best algorithm on many problem instances. Also, we show\nthat a proper warm-starting procedure is crucial to achieving high actual\nperformance gain for some algorithm pairs. Lastly, with a sensitivity analysis,\nwe find the actual performance gain is hugely affected by the switching point,\nand in some cases, the switching point yielding the best actual performance\ndiffers from the one computed from the theoretical gain.",

    "abstract": "Wildfires are a threat to public safety and have increased in both frequency\nand severity due to climate change. To mitigate wildfire ignition risks,\nelectric power system operators proactively de-energize high-risk power lines\nduring \"public safety power shut-off\" (PSPS) events. Line de-energizations can\ncause communities to lose power, which may result in negative economic, health,\nand safety impacts. Furthermore, the same communities may repeatedly experience\npower shutoffs over the course of a wildfire season, which compounds these\nnegative impacts. However, there are often many combinations of power lines\nwhose de-energization will result in about the same reduction of wildfire risk,\nbut the associated power loss affects different communities. Therefore, one may\nraise concerns regarding the fairness of de-energization decisions.\nAccordingly, this paper proposes a model-predictive-control-inspired framework\nto select lines to de-energize in order to balance wildfire risk reduction,\ntotal load shedding, and fairness considerations. The goal of the framework is\nto prevent a small fraction of communities from disproportionally being\nimpacted by PSPS events, and to instead more equally share the burden of power\noutages. For a geolocated test case in the southwestern United States, we use\nactual California demand data as well as real wildfire risk forecasts to\nsimulate PSPS events during the 2021 wildfire season and compare the\nperformance of various methods for promoting fairness. Our results demonstrate\nthat the proposed formulation can provide significantly more fair outcomes with\nlimited impacts on system-wide performance.",

    "abstract": "Though the sharing of medical data has the potential to lead to breakthroughs\nin health care, the sharing process itself exposes patients and health care\nproviders to various risks. Patients face risks due to the possible loss in\nprivacy or livelihood that can occur when medical data is stolen or used in\nnon-permitted ways, whereas health care providers face risks due to the\nassociated liability. For medical data, these risks persist even after\nanonymizing/deidentifying, according to the standards defined in existing\nlegislation, the data sets prior to sharing, because shared medical data can\noften be deanonymized/reidentified using advanced artificial intelligence and\nmachine learning methodologies. As a result, health care providers are hesitant\nto share medical data. One possible solution to encourage health care providers\nto responsibly share data is through the use of cybersecurity insurance\ncontracts. This paper studies the problem of designing optimal cybersecurity\ninsurance contracts, with the goal of encouraging the sharing of the medical\ndata. We use a principal-agent model with moral hazard to model various\nscenarios, derive the optimal contract, discuss its implications, and perform\nnumerical case studies. In particular, we consider two scenarios: the first\nscenario is where a health care provider is selling medical data to a\ntechnology firm who is developing an artificial intelligence algorithm using\nthe shared data. The second scenario is where a group of health care providers\nshare health data amongst themselves for the purpose of furthering medical\nresearch using the aggregated medical data.",

Lagrangian Coherent Structures have\nbeen introduced to obtain separatrices between regions of qualitatively\ndifferent flow in three-dimensional dynamical systems with arbitrary\ntime-dependence. However, the numerical method to compute them requires\nobtaining derivatives associated with the system, often performed through the\napproximation of divided differences, which leads to significant numerical\nerror and numerical noise. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for the\nnumerical calculation of hyperbolic Lagrangian Coherent Structures using\nDifferential Algebra called DA-LCS. As a form of automatic forward\ndifferentiation, it allows direct computation of the Taylor expansion of the\nflow, its derivatives, and its eigenvectors, with all derivatives obtained\nalgebraically and to machine precision. It does so without a priori information\nabout the system, such as variational equations or explicit derivatives. We\ndemonstrate that this provides significant improvements in the accuracy of the\nLagrangian Coherent Structures identified compared to finite-differencing\nmethods in a series of test cases drawn from the literature.

The average Dice coefficient, boundary Dice coefficient,\nand the 95th percentile of Hausdorff distance are 0.91, 0.94, and 1.53 mm\nrespectively. We perform an additional qualitative evaluation by 3-D printing\nand visualization in mixed reality to confirm the implant's usefulness.\nWe propose a complete pipeline that enables one to create the cranial implant\nmodel ready for 3-D printing. The described method is a greatly extended\nversion of the method that scored 1st place in all AutoImplant 2021 challenge\ntasks. We freely release the source code, that together with the open datasets,\nmakes the results fully reproducible. The automatic reconstruction of cranial\ndefects may enable manufacturing personalized implants in a significantly\nshorter time, possibly allowing one to perform the 3-D printing process\ndirectly during a given intervention. Moreover, we show the usability of the\ndefect reconstruction in mixed reality that may further reduce the surgery\ntime.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a mathematical method of playing the puzzle game Wordle.\nIn Wordle, the player has six tries to guess a secret word. After each guess\nthe player is told how their guess compares to the secret word. With the\navailable information the player makes their next guess. This paper proposes\ncombining a rank one approximation and latent semantic indexing to a matrix\nrepresenting the list of all possible solutions. Rank one approximation finds\nthe dominant eigenvector of a matrix of words, and latent semantic indexing\nreveals which word is closest to the dominant eigenvector. The word whose\ncolumn vector is closest to the dominant eigenvector is chosen as the next\nguess. With this method the most representative word of the set of all possible\nsolutions is selected. This paper describes how a word can be converted to a\nvector and the theory behind a rank one approximation and latent semantic\nindexing. This paper presents results demonstrating that with an initial guess\nof \"SLATE\" the method solves the puzzle in 4.04 guesses on average, with a\nsuccess rate of 98.7%",

These models are of great value to medicinal\nchemists, in particular if they provide case-specific insight into the physical\ninteractions that drive the binding process. In this study we derive ML models\nfrom over 50 fragment-screening campaigns to introduce two important elements\nthat we believe are absent in most -- if not all -- ML studies of this type\nreported to date: First, alongside the observed hits we use to train our\nmodels, we incorporate true misses and show that these experimentally validated\nnegative data are of significant importance to the quality of the derived\nmodels. Second, we provide a physically interpretable and verifiable\nrepresentation of what the ML model considers important for successful binding.\nThis representation is derived from a straightforward attribution procedure\nthat explains the prediction in terms of the (inter-)action of chemical\nenvironments. Critically, we validate the attribution outcome on a large scale\nagainst prior annotations made independently by expert molecular modellers. We\nfind good agreement between the key molecular substructures proposed by the ML\nmodel and those assigned manually, even when the model's performance in\ndiscriminating hits from misses is far from perfect. By projecting the\nattribution onto predefined interaction prototypes (pharmacophores), we show\nthat ML allows us to formulate simple rules for what drives fragment binding\nagainst a target automatically from screening data.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and\nadenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common subtype. Exploiting the potential\nvalue of the histopathology images can promote precision medicine in oncology.\nTissue segmentation is the basic upstream task of histopathology image\nanalysis. Existing deep learning models have achieved superior segmentation\nperformance but require sufficient pixel-level annotations, which is\ntime-consuming and expensive. To enrich the label resources of LUAD and to\nalleviate the annotation efforts, we organize this challenge WSSS4LUAD to call\nfor the outstanding weakly-supervised semantic segmentation techniques for\nhistopathology images of LUAD. Participants have to design the algorithm to\nsegment tumor epithelial, tumor-associated stroma and normal tissue with only\npatch-level labels. This challenge includes 10,091 patch-level annotations (the\ntraining set) and over 130 million labeled pixels (the validation and test\nsets), from 67 WSIs (47 from GDPH, 20 from TCGA). All the labels were generated\nby a pathologist-in-the-loop pipeline with the help of AI models and checked by\nthe label review board. Among 532 registrations, 28 teams submitted the results\nin the test phase with over 1,000 submissions. Finally, the first place team\nachieved mIoU of 0.8413 (tumor: 0.8389, stroma: 0.7931, normal: 0.8919).\nAccording to the technical reports of the top-tier teams, CAM is still the most\npopular approach in WSSS. Cutmix data augmentation has been widely adopted to\ngenerate more reliable samples. With the success of this challenge, we believe\nthat WSSS approaches with patch-level annotations can replace the traditional\npixel annotations while reducing the annotation efforts. The entire dataset has\nbeen released to encourage more researches on computational pathology in LUAD\nand more novel WSSS techniques.",

    "abstract": "Maximum entropy network ensembles have been very successful to model sparse\nnetwork topologies and to solve challenging inference problems. However the\nsparse maximum entropy network models proposed so far have fixed number of\nnodes and are typically not exchangeable. Here we consider hierarchical models\nfor exchangeable networks in the sparse limit, i.e. with the total number of\nlinks scaling linearly with the total number of nodes. The approach is grand\ncanonical, i.e. the number of nodes of the network is not fixed a priori: it is\nfinite but can be arbitrarily large. In this way the grand canonical network\nensembles circumvent the difficulties in treating infinite sparse exchangeable\nnetworks which according to the Aldous-Hoover theorem must vanish. The approach\ncan treat networks with given degree distribution or networks with given\ndistribution of latent variables. When only a subgraph induced by a subset of\nnodes is known, this model allows a Bayesian estimation of the network size and\nthe degree sequence (or the sequence of latent variables) of the entire network\nwhich can be used for network reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Audio bandwidth extension aims to expand the spectrum of narrow-band audio\nsignals. Although this topic has been broadly studied during recent years, the\nparticular problem of extending the bandwidth of historical music recordings\nremains an open challenge. This paper proposes BEHM-GAN, a model based on\ngenerative adversarial networks, as a practical solution to this problem. The\nproposed method works with the complex spectrogram representation of audio and,\nthanks to a dedicated regularization strategy, can effectively extend the\nbandwidth of out-of-distribution real historical recordings. The BEHM-GAN is\ndesigned to be applied as a second step after denoising the recording to\nsuppress any additive disturbances, such as clicks and background noise. We\ntrain and evaluate the method using solo piano classical music. The proposed\nmethod outperforms the compared baselines in both objective and subjective\nexperiments. The results of a formal blind listening test show that BEHM-GAN\nsignificantly increases the perceptual sound quality in early-20th-century\ngramophone recordings. For several items, there is a substantial improvement in\nthe mean opinion score after enhancing historical recordings with the proposed\nbandwidth-extension algorithm.
