    "abstract": "Games are complex, multi-faceted systems that share common elements and\nunderlying narratives, such as the conflict between a hero and a big bad enemy\nor pursuing some goal that requires overcoming challenges. However, identifying\nand describing these elements together is non-trivial as they might differ in\ncertain properties and how players might encounter the narratives. Likewise,\ngenerating narratives also pose difficulties when encoding, interpreting,\nanalyzing, and evaluating them. To address this, we present TropeTwist, a\ntrope-based system that can describe narrative structures in games in a more\nabstract and generic level, allowing the definition of games' narrative\nstructures and their generation using interconnected tropes, called narrative\ngraphs. To demonstrate the system, we represent the narrative structure of\nthree different games. We use MAP-Elites to generate and evaluate novel\nquality-diverse narrative graphs encoded as graph grammars, using these three\nhand-made narrative structures as targets. Both hand-made and generated\nnarrative graphs are evaluated based on their coherence and interestingness,\nwhich are improved through evolution.",

    "abstract": "This paper tries to address the problem of abusive comment detection in\nlow-resource indic languages. Abusive comments are statements that are\noffensive to a person or a group of people. These comments are targeted toward\nindividuals belonging to specific ethnicities, genders, caste, race, sexuality,\netc. Abusive Comment Detection is a significant problem, especially with the\nrecent rise in social media users. This paper presents the approach used by our\nteam - Optimize_Prime, in the ACL 2022 shared task \"Abusive Comment Detection\nin Tamil.\" This task detects and classifies YouTube comments in Tamil and\nTamil- English Codemixed format into multiple categories. We have used three\nmethods to optimize our results: Ensemble models, Recurrent Neural Networks,\nand Transformers. In the Tamil data, MuRIL and XLM-RoBERTA were our best\nperforming models with a macro-averaged f1 score of 0.43. Furthermore, for the\nCode-mixed data, MuRIL and M-BERT provided sub-lime results, with a\nmacro-averaged f1 score of 0.45.",

    "abstract": "Super-resolution suffers from an innate ill-posed problem that a single\nlow-resolution (LR) image can be from multiple high-resolution (HR) images.\nRecent studies on the flow-based algorithm solve this ill-posedness by learning\nthe super-resolution space and predicting diverse HR outputs. Unfortunately,\nthe diversity of the super-resolution outputs is still unsatisfactory, and the\noutputs from the flow-based model usually suffer from undesired artifacts which\ncauses low-quality outputs. In this paper, we propose FS-NCSR which produces\ndiverse and high-quality super-resolution outputs using frequency separation\nand noise conditioning compared to the existing flow-based approaches. As the\nsharpness and high-quality detail of the image rely on its high-frequency\ninformation, FS-NCSR only estimates the high-frequency information of the\nhigh-resolution outputs without redundant low-frequency components. Through\nthis, FS-NCSR significantly improves the diversity score without significant\nimage quality degradation compared to the NCSR, the winner of the previous\nNTIRE 2021 challenge.",

    "abstract": "Biological systems in nature have evolved for millions of years to adapt and\nsurvive the environment. Many features they developed can be inspirational and\nbeneficial for solving technical problems in modern industries. This leads to a\nnovel form of design-by-analogy called bio-inspired design (BID). Although BID\nas a design method has been proven beneficial, the gap between biology and\nengineering continuously hinders designers from effectively applying the\nmethod. Therefore, we explore the recent advance of artificial intelligence\n(AI) for a computational approach to bridge the gap. This paper proposes a\ngenerative design approach based on the pre-trained language model (PLM) to\nautomatically retrieve and map biological analogy and generate BID in the form\nof natural language. The latest generative pre-trained transformer, namely\nGPT-3, is used as the base PLM. Three types of design concept generators are\nidentified and fine-tuned from the PLM according to the looseness of the\nproblem space representation. Machine evaluators are also fine-tuned to assess\nthe correlation between the domains within the generated BID concepts. The\napproach is then tested via a case study in which the fine-tuned models are\napplied to generate and evaluate light-weighted flying car concepts inspired by\nnature. The results show our approach can generate BID concepts with good\nperformance.",

Most work focuses on improving cross-modal embeddings using unimodal\nencoders, that allow for efficient retrieval in large-scale databases, leaving\naside cross-attention between modalities which is more computationally\nexpensive. We propose a new retrieval framework, T-Food (Transformer Decoders\nwith MultiModal Regularization for Cross-Modal Food Retrieval) that exploits\nthe interaction between modalities in a novel regularization scheme, while\nusing only unimodal encoders at test time for efficient retrieval.

    "abstract": "The limited communication resources, e.g., bandwidth and energy, and data\nheterogeneity across devices are two of the main bottlenecks for federated\nlearning (FL). To tackle these challenges, we first devise a novel FL framework\nwith partial model aggregation (PMA), which only aggregates the lower layers of\nneural networks responsible for feature extraction while the upper layers\ncorresponding to complex pattern recognition remain at devices for\npersonalization. The proposed PMA-FL is able to address the data heterogeneity\nand reduce the transmitted information in wireless channels. We then obtain a\nconvergence bound of the framework under a non-convex loss function setting.\nWith the aid of this bound, we define a new objective function, named the\nscheduled data sample volume, to transfer the original inexplicit optimization\nproblem into a tractable one for device scheduling, bandwidth allocation,\ncomputation and communication time division. Our analysis reveals that the\noptimal time division is achieved when the communication and computation parts\nof PMA-FL have the same power. We also develop a bisection method to solve the\noptimal bandwidth allocation policy and use the set expansion algorithm to\naddress the optimal device scheduling. Compared with the state-of-the-art\nbenchmarks, the proposed PMA-FL improves 2.72% and 11.6% accuracy on two\ntypical heterogeneous datasets, i.e., MINIST and CIFAR-10, respectively. In\naddition, the proposed joint dynamic device scheduling and resource\noptimization approach achieve slightly higher accuracy than the considered\nbenchmarks, but they provide a satisfactory energy and time reduction: 29%\nenergy or 20% time reduction on the MNIST; and 25% energy or 12.5% time\nreduction on the CIFAR-10.",

    "abstract": "How does scientific knowledge grow? For generations, this question has\noccupied a central place in the philosophy of science, stimulating heated\ndebates, and yielding no clear consensus. Many proposed explanations can be\nunderstood in terms of whether and how they view the expansion of knowledge as\nproceeding through the organization of scientific concepts into core/periphery\nstructures, wherein the core encompasses foundational knowledge and the\nperiphery consists of emergent ideas. Here, we examine these views empirically,\nperforming a large-scale analysis of the physical and social sciences, spanning\nfive decades. Using techniques from natural language processing, we create\nsemantic networks of concepts, wherein single- and multi-word noun phrases\nbecome linked when they are used in the same paper abstract. For both the\nphysical and social sciences, we observe increasingly rigid cores accompanied\nby the proliferation of periphery concepts. In the physical sciences, these\nchanges coincide with an increasing number of cores, while in the social\nsciences, the number of cores is decreasing. In subsequent analyses, we examine\nthe relationship between core/periphery organization and the growth of\nscientific knowledge, finding that scientific works are less innovative in\nfields with smaller cores, cores with less conceptual churn, and an overall\nlarger number of cores, the latter of which is also associated with less\nscientific consensus. Overall, our findings suggest that while the organization\nof scientific concepts is important for the growth of knowledge, the mechanisms\nvary across fields and time.",

Our approach, implemented in CRIKit (the Constitutive\nRelation Inference Toolkit), is to model the material time derivative of damage\nas a frame-invariant neural network, and to optimize the parameters of the\nmodel from simulations of the flow of an ice dome. Using the model of Albrecht\nand Levermann as the ground truth to generate synthetic observations, we\nmeasure the difference of optimized neural network models from that model to\ntry to understand how well this process generates models that can then transfer\nto other ice sheet simulations.\nThe use of so-called \"deep-learning\" models for constitutive equations,\nequations of state, sub-grid-scale processes, and other pointwise relations\nthat appear in systems of PDEs has been successful in other disciplines, yet\nour inference setting has some confounding factors. The first is the type of\nobservations that are available: we compare the quality of the inferred models\nwhen the loss of the numerical simulations includes observation misfits\nthroughout the ice, which is unobtainable in real settings, to losses that\ninclude only combinations of surface and borehole observations. The second\nconfounding factor is the evolution of damage in an ice sheet, which is\nadvection dominated. The non-local effect of perturbations in a damage models\nresults in loss functions that have both many local minima and many parameter\nconfigurations for which the system is unsolvable.\nOur experience suggests that basic neural networks have several deficiencies\nthat affect the quality of the optimized models.

    "abstract": "Creating and maintaining a modern, heterogeneous set of client applications\nremains an obstacle for many businesses and individuals. While simple\ndomain-specific graphical languages and libraries can empower a variety of\nusers to create application behaviors and logic, using these languages to\nproduce and maintain a set of heterogeneous client applications is a challenge.\nPrimarily because each client typically requires the developers to both\nunderstand and embed the domain-specific logic. This is because application\nlogic must be encoded to some extent in both the server and client sides.\nIn this paper, we propose an alternative approach, which allows the\nspecification of application logic to reside solely on the cloud. We have built\na system where reusable application components can be assembled on the cloud in\ndifferent logical chains and the client is largely decoupled from this logic\nand is solely concerned with how data is displayed and gathered from users of\nthe application. In this way, the chaining of requests and responses is done by\nthe cloud and the client side has no knowledge of the application logic.\nAn additional effect of our approach is that the client side developer is\nable to immediately see any changes they make, while executing the logic\nresiding on the cloud. This further allows more novice programmers to perform\nthese customizations, as they do not need to `get the full application working'\nand are able to see the results of their code as they go, thereby lowering the\nobstacles to businesses and individuals to produce and maintain applications.\nFurthermore, this decoupling enables the quick generation and customization of\na variety of application clients, ranging from web to mobile devices and\npersonal assistants, while customizing one or more as needed.",

A\ncomputational procedure was further developed in \\cite{SH15} for deformation\nbetween any two polygons. The bijectivity of the map based on harmonic GBC\nfunctions is still murky in the literature. In this paper, we present an\nelementary proof of the bijection of the harmonic GBC map transforming from one\narbitrary polygonal domain $V$ to a convex polygonal domain $W$. This result is\nfurther extended to a more general harmonic map from one simply connected\ndomain $V$ to a convex domain $W$ if the harmonic map preserves the orientation\nof the boundary of the domain $V$. In addition, we shall point out that the\nharmonic GBC map is also a diffeomorphism over the interior of $V$ to the\ninterior of $W$. Finally, we remark on how to construct a harmonic GBC map from\n$V$ to $W$ when the number of vertices of $V$ is different from the number of\nvertices of $W$ and how to construct harmonic GBC functions over a polygonal\ndomain with a hole or holes.

For instance, LitCovid is a literature\ndatabase of COVID-19-related articles in PubMed, which has accumulated more\nthan 200,000 articles with millions of accesses each month by users worldwide.\nOne primary curation task is to assign up to eight topics (e.g., Diagnosis and\nTreatment) to the articles in LitCovid.

To close the gap, we organized the BioCreative LitCovid\ntrack to call for a community effort to tackle automated topic annotation for\nCOVID-19 literature.

    "abstract": "Point set registration is the process of finding the best alignment between\ntwo point sets, and it is a common task in different domains, especially in the\nautomotive and mobile robotics domains. Lots of approaches are proposed in the\nliterature, where the iterative closest point ICP is a well-known approach in\nthis vein, which builds an explicit correspondence between both point sets to\nachieve the registration task. However, this work is interested in achieving\nthe registration without building any explicit correspondence between both\npoint sets, following a probabilistic framework.\nThe most critical task in point set registration is how to elaborate the cost\nfunction, which measures the distance between both point sets. The\nprobabilistic framework includes two possible ways to build the cost function:\nThe summing and the likelihood. The main focus of this work is to analyze and\ncompare the behavior of both approaches. Therefore, a 1D synthetic scenario is\nused to build the cost function step by step, besides the estimation error.\nFinally, this work uses two data sets for evaluation: A 2D synthetic data set\nand a real data set. The evaluation process compares and analyzes the\nestimation error and estimated uncertainty. Thus, two different methods are\nused in the evaluation process: The normalized estimation error squared NEES\nand noncredibility index NCI. A 77 GHz automotive Doppler radar provides the\nreal data set, and in the real evaluation, we evaluate the ego-motion\nestimation of a robot as an application for the registration.",

    "abstract": "Despite the success of reinforcement learning (RL) for Markov decision\nprocesses (MDPs) with function approximation, most RL algorithms easily fail if\nthe agent only has partial observations of the state. Such a setting is often\nmodeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Existing\nsample-efficient algorithms for POMDPs are restricted to the tabular setting\nwhere the state and observation spaces are finite. In this paper, we make the\nfirst attempt at tackling the tension between function approximation and\npartial observability. In specific, we focus on a class of undercomplete POMDPs\nwith linear function approximations, which allows the state and observation\nspaces to be infinite. For such POMDPs, we show that the optimal policy and\nvalue function can be characterized by a sequence of finite-memory Bellman\noperators. We propose an RL algorithm that constructs optimistic estimators of\nthese operators via reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) embedding.\nMoreover, we theoretically prove that the proposed algorithm finds an\n$\\varepsilon$-optimal policy with $\\tilde O (1/\\varepsilon^2)$ episodes of\nexploration. Also, this sample complexity only depends on the intrinsic\ndimension of the POMDP polynomially and is independent of the size of the state\nand observation spaces. To our best knowledge, we develop the first provably\nsample-efficient algorithm for POMDPs with function approximation.",

SELMA is based on CARLA, an open-source simulator for generating\nsynthetic data in autonomous driving scenarios, that we modified to increase\nthe variability and the diversity in the scenes and class sets, and to align it\nwith other benchmark datasets.

In this paper, the raw LiDAR data were transformed into a\nmulti-dimensional tensor structure based on the elevation and azimuth value of\neach LiDAR point. With this high-order data representation, we break the\nbarrier to allow the efficient Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) method for roadside\nLiDAR background modeling.

The core idea of transfer learning (TL) is that\nknowledge gained in learning to perform one task (source) can be leveraged to\nimprove learning performance in a related, but different, task (target). TL\nleverages and transfers previously acquired knowledge to address the expense of\ndata acquisition and labeling, potential computational power limitations, and\nthe dataset distribution mismatches. Although significant progress has been\nmade in the fields of image processing, speech recognition, and natural\nlanguage processing (for classification and regression) for TL, little work has\nbeen done in the field of scientific machine learning for functional regression\nand uncertainty quantification in partial differential equations. In this work,\nwe propose a novel TL framework for task-specific learning under conditional\nshift with a deep operator network (DeepONet). Inspired by the conditional\nembedding operator theory, we measure the statistical distance between the\nsource domain and the target feature domain by embedding conditional\ndistributions onto a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Task-specific operator\nlearning is accomplished by fine-tuning task-specific layers of the target\nDeepONet using a hybrid loss function that allows for the matching of\nindividual target samples while also preserving the global properties of the\nconditional distribution of target data. We demonstrate the advantages of our\napproach for various TL scenarios involving nonlinear PDEs under conditional\nshift.

IPv6 deployment also makes it harder to deploy TCAMs\nbecause of the larger prefixes used in the 128-bit address space. While the\ncombination of algorithmic techniques and TCAM has been proposed before for\nreducing power consumption or update costs(e.g., CoolCAM [32] and TreeCAM\n[28]), we focus on reducing TCAM bits using a scheme we call MashUp that can\neasily be implemented in modern reconfigurable pipeline chips such as Tofino-3.\nMashUp uses a new technique, tiling trees, which takes into account TCAM grain\n(tile) sizes. When applied to a publicly available IPv6 dataset using Tofino-3\nTCAM grain sizes (44 by 512), there was a 2X reduction in TCAM required.\nFurther, if we mix TCAM and SRAM using a new technique we call node\nhybridization, MashUp decreases TCAM bits by 4.5X for IPv6, and by 7.5X for\nIPv4, allowing wide area databases of 900,000 prefixes to be supported by\nTofino-3 and similar chips",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the restoration and reconstruction of piecewise\nconstant objects in two and three dimensions using PaLEnTIR, a significantly\nenhanced Parametric level set (PaLS) model relative to the current\nstate-of-the-art. The primary contribution of this paper is a new PaLS\nformulation which requires only a single level set function to recover a scene\nwith piecewise constant objects possessing multiple unknown contrasts. Our\nmodel offers distinct advantages over current approaches to the multi-contrast,\nmulti-object problem, all of which require multiple level sets and explicit\nestimation of the contrast magnitudes. Given upper and lower bounds on the\ncontrast, our approach is able to recover objects with any distribution of\ncontrasts and eliminates the need to know either the number of contrasts in a\ngiven scene or their values. We provide an iterative process for finding these\nspace-varying contrast limits. Relative to most PaLS methods which employ\nradial basis functions (RBFs), our model makes use of non-isotropic basis\nfunctions, thereby expanding the class of shapes that a PaLS model of a given\ncomplexity can approximate. Finally, PaLEnTIR improves the conditioning of the\nJacobian matrix required as part of the parameter identification process and\nconsequently accelerates the optimization methods by controlling the magnitude\nof the PaLS expansion coefficients, fixing the centers of the basis functions,\nand the uniqueness of parametric to image mappings provided by the new\nparameterization. We demonstrate the performance of the new approach using both\n2D and 3D variants of X-ray computed tomography, diffuse optical tomography\n(DOT), denoising, deconvolution problems. Application to experimental sparse CT\ndata and simulated data with different types of noise are performed to further\nvalidate the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid increasing of data scale, in-database analytics and learning\nhas become one of the most studied topics in data science community, because of\nits significance on reducing the gap between the management and the analytics\nof data. By extending the capability of database on analytics and learning,\ndata scientists can save much time on exchanging data between databases and\nexternal analytic tools. For this goal, researchers are attempting to integrate\nmore data science algorithms into database. However, implementing the\nalgorithms in mainstream databases is super time-consuming, especially when it\nis necessary to have a deep dive into the database kernels. Thus there are\ndemands for an easy-to-extend database simulator to help fast prototype and\nverify the in-database algorithms before implementing them in real databases.\nIn this demo, we present such an extensible relational database simulator,\nDBSim, to help data scientists prototype their in-database analytics and\nlearning algorithms and verify the effectiveness of their ideas with minimal\ncost. DBSim simulates a real relational database by integrating all the major\ncomponents in mainstream RDBMS, including SQL parser, relational operators,\nquery optimizer, etc. In addition, DBSim provides various interfaces for users\nto flexibly plug their custom extension modules into any of the major\ncomponents, without modifying the kernel. By those interfaces, DBSim supports\neasy extensions on SQL syntax, relational operators, query optimizer rules and\ncost models, and physical plan execution. Furthermore, DBSim provides utilities\nto facilitate users' developing and debugging, like query plan visualizer and\ninteractive analyzer on optimization rules. We develop DBSim using pure Python\nto support seamless implementation of most data science algorithms into it,\nsince many of them are written in Python.",

However, they typically\nrequire skeletal pre-modeling and label information for training, which leads\nto limited applicability of these methods. In this paper, we focus on\nunsupervised skeleton-based person re-ID, and present a generic Simple Masked\nContrastive learning (SimMC) framework to learn effective representations from\nunlabeled 3D skeletons for person re-ID. Specifically, to fully exploit\nskeleton features within each skeleton sequence, we first devise a masked\nprototype contrastive learning (MPC) scheme to cluster the most typical\nskeleton features (skeleton prototypes) from different subsequences randomly\nmasked from raw sequences, and contrast the inherent similarity between\nskeleton features and different prototypes to learn discriminative skeleton\nrepresentations without using any label. Then, considering that different\nsubsequences within the same sequence usually enjoy strong correlations due to\nthe nature of motion continuity, we propose the masked intra-sequence\ncontrastive learning (MIC) to capture intra-sequence pattern consistency\nbetween subsequences, so as to encourage learning more effective skeleton\nrepresentations for person re-ID. Extensive experiments validate that the\nproposed SimMC outperforms most state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods.

    "abstract": "Online learning with expert advice is a fundamental problem of sequential\nprediction. In this problem, the algorithm has access to a set of $n$ \"experts\"\nwho make predictions on each day. The goal on each day is to process these\npredictions, and make a prediction with the minimum cost. After making a\nprediction, the algorithm sees the actual outcome on that day, updates its\nstate, and then moves on to the next day. An algorithm is judged by how well it\ndoes compared to the best expert in the set.\nThe classical algorithm for this problem is the multiplicative weights\nalgorithm. However, every application, to our knowledge, relies on storing\nweights for every expert, and uses $\\Omega(n)$ memory. There is little work on\nunderstanding the memory required to solve the online learning with expert\nadvice problem, or run standard sequential prediction algorithms, in natural\nstreaming models, which is especially important when the number of experts, as\nwell as the number of days on which the experts make predictions, is large.\nWe initiate the study of the learning with expert advice problem in the\nstreaming setting, and show lower and upper bounds. Our lower bound for i.i.d.,\nrandom order, and adversarial order streams uses a reduction to a custom-built\nproblem using a novel masking technique, to show a smooth trade-off for regret\nversus memory. Our upper bounds show novel ways to run standard sequential\nprediction algorithms in rounds on small \"pools\" of experts, thus reducing the\nnecessary memory. For random-order streams, we show that our upper bound is\ntight up to low order terms. We hope that these results and techniques will\nhave broad applications in online learning, and can inspire algorithms based on\nstandard sequential prediction techniques, like multiplicative weights, for a\nwide range of other problems in the memory-constrained setting.",

However, existing frameworks for ML risk/impact\nassessment often address an abstract notion of risk or do not concretize this\ndependence.\nWe propose to address this gap with a context-sensitive framework for\nidentifying ML system risks comprising two components: a taxonomy of the first-\nand second-order risks posed by ML systems, and their contributing factors.\nFirst-order risks stem from aspects of the ML system, while second-order risks\nstem from the consequences of first-order risks. These consequences are system\nfailures that result from design and development choices. We explore how\ndifferent risks may manifest in various types of ML systems, the factors that\naffect each risk, and how first-order risks may lead to second-order effects\nwhen the system interacts with the real world.\nThroughout the paper, we show how real events and prior research fit into our\nMachine Learning System Risk framework (MLSR). MLSR operates on ML systems\nrather than technologies or domains, recognizing that a system's design,\nimplementation, and use case all contribute to its risk. In doing so, it\nunifies the risks that are commonly discussed in the ethical AI community\n(e.g., ethical/human rights risks) with system-level risks (e.g., application,\ndesign, control risks), paving the way for holistic risk assessments of ML\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "Automatic terrain recognition in Mars rover images is an important problem\nnot just for navigation, but for scientists interested in studying rock types,\nand by extension, conditions of the ancient Martian paleoclimate and\nhabitability. Existing approaches to label Martian terrain either involve the\nuse of non-expert annotators producing taxonomies of limited granularity (e.g.\nsoil, sand, bedrock, float rock, etc.), or rely on generic class discovery\napproaches that tend to produce perceptual classes such as rover parts and\nlandscape, which are irrelevant to geologic analysis. Expert-labeled datasets\ncontaining granular geological/geomorphological terrain categories are rare or\ninaccessible to public, and sometimes require the extraction of relevant\ncategorical information from complex annotations. In order to facilitate the\ncreation of a dataset with detailed terrain categories, we present a\nself-supervised method that can cluster sedimentary textures in images captured\nfrom the Mast camera onboard the Curiosity rover (Mars Science Laboratory). We\nthen present a qualitative analysis of these clusters and describe their\ngeologic significance via the creation of a set of granular terrain categories.\nThe precision and geologic validation of these automatically discovered\nclusters suggest that our methods are promising for the rapid classification of\nimportant geologic features and will therefore facilitate our long-term goal of\nproducing a large, granular, and publicly available dataset for Mars terrain\nrecognition.",

    "abstract": "Cross-modal remote sensing text-image retrieval (RSCTIR) has recently become\nan urgent research hotspot due to its ability of enabling fast and flexible\ninformation extraction on remote sensing (RS) images. However, current RSCTIR\nmethods mainly focus on global features of RS images, which leads to the\nneglect of local features that reflect target relationships and saliency. In\nthis article, we first propose a novel RSCTIR framework based on global and\nlocal information (GaLR), and design a multi-level information dynamic fusion\n(MIDF) module to efficaciously integrate features of different levels. MIDF\nleverages local information to correct global information, utilizes global\ninformation to supplement local information, and uses the dynamic addition of\nthe two to generate prominent visual representation. To alleviate the pressure\nof the redundant targets on the graph convolution network (GCN) and to improve\nthe model s attention on salient instances during modeling local features, the\nde-noised representation matrix and the enhanced adjacency matrix (DREA) are\ndevised to assist GCN in producing superior local representations. DREA not\nonly filters out redundant features with high similarity, but also obtains more\npowerful local features by enhancing the features of prominent objects.\nFinally, to make full use of the information in the similarity matrix during\ninference, we come up with a plug-and-play multivariate rerank (MR) algorithm.\nThe algorithm utilizes the k nearest neighbors of the retrieval results to\nperform a reverse search, and improves the performance by combining multiple\ncomponents of bidirectional retrieval. Extensive experiments on public datasets\nstrongly demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of GaLR methods on the\nRSCTIR task.

Despite promising recent results, we find evidence that reference-free\nevaluation metrics of summarization and dialog generation may be relying on\nspurious correlations with measures such as word overlap, perplexity, and\nlength. We further observe that for text summarization, these metrics have high\nerror rates when ranking current state-of-the-art abstractive summarization\nsystems. We demonstrate that these errors can be mitigated by explicitly\ndesigning evaluation metrics to avoid spurious features in reference-free\nevaluation.",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is considered more biologically realistic and\npower-efficient as it imitates the fundamental mechanism of the human brain.\nRecently, backpropagation (BP) based SNN learning algorithms that utilize deep\nlearning frameworks have achieved good performance. However,\nbio-interpretability is partially neglected in those BP-based algorithms.\nToward bio-plausible BP-based SNNs, we consider three properties in modeling\nspike activities: Multiplicity, Adaptability, and Plasticity (MAP). In terms of\nmultiplicity, we propose a Multiple-Spike Pattern (MSP) with multiple spike\ntransmission to strengthen model robustness in discrete time-iteration. To\nrealize adaptability, we adopt Spike Frequency Adaption (SFA) under MSP to\ndecrease spike activities for improved efficiency. For plasticity, we propose a\ntrainable convolutional synapse that models spike response current to enhance\nthe diversity of spiking neurons for temporal feature extraction. The proposed\nSNN model achieves competitive performances on neuromorphic datasets: N-MNIST\nand SHD. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed three\naspects are significant to iterative robustness, spike efficiency, and temporal\nfeature extraction capability of spike activities. In summary, this work\nproposes a feasible scheme for bio-inspired spike activities with MAP, offering\na new neuromorphic perspective to embed biological characteristics into spiking\nneural networks.",

    "title": "Unsupervised Video Interpolation by Learning Multilayered 2.5D Motion  Fields",
    "abstract": "The problem of video frame interpolation is to increase the temporal\nresolution of a low frame-rate video, by interpolating novel frames between\nexisting temporally sparse frames. This paper presents a self-supervised\napproach to video frame interpolation that requires only a single video. We\npose the video as a set of layers. Each layer is parameterized by two implicit\nneural networks -- one for learning a static frame and the other for a\ntime-varying motion field corresponding to video dynamics. Together they\nrepresent an occlusion-free subset of the scene with a pseudo-depth channel. To\nmodel inter-layer occlusions, all layers are lifted to the 2.5D space so that\nthe frontal layer occludes distant layers. This is done by assigning each layer\na depth channel, which we call `pseudo-depth', whose partial order defines the\nocclusion between layers. The pseudo-depths are converted to visibility values\nthrough a fully differentiable SoftMin function so that closer layers are more\nvisible than layers in a distance. On the other hand, we parameterize the video\nmotions by solving an ordinary differentiable equation (ODE) defined on a\ntime-varying neural velocity field that guarantees valid motions. This implicit\nneural representation learns the video as a space-time continuum, allowing\nframe interpolation at any temporal resolution. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method on real-world datasets, where our method achieves\ncomparable performance to state-of-the-arts that require ground truth labels\nfor training.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely employed to enhance the\nend-to-end performance of wireless communications since the links between UAVs\nand terrestrial nodes are line-of-sight (LoS) with high probability. However,\nthe broadcast characteristics of signal propagation in LoS links make it\nvulnerable to being wiretapped by malicious eavesdroppers, which poses a\nconsiderable challenge to the security of wireless communications. This paper\ninvestigates the security of aerial cognitive radio networks (CRNs). An\nairborne base station transmits confidential messages to secondary users\nutilizing the same spectrum as the primary network. An aerial base station\ntransmits jamming signals to suppress the eavesdropper to enhance secrecy\nperformance. The uncertainty of eavesdropping node locations is considered, and\nthe average secrecy rate of the cognitive user is maximized by optimizing\nmultiple users' scheduling, the UAVs' trajectory, and transmit power. To solve\nthe non-convex optimization problem with mixed multiple integers variable\nproblem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent\nand successive convex approximation. Numerical results verify the effectiveness\nof our proposed algorithm and demonstrate that our scheme is beneficial to\nimproving the secrecy performance of aerial CRNs.",

    "abstract": "Few-shot segmentation, which aims to segment unseen-class objects given only\na handful of densely labeled samples, has received widespread attention from\nthe community. Existing approaches typically follow the prototype learning\nparadigm to perform meta-inference, which fails to fully exploit the underlying\ninformation from support image-mask pairs, resulting in various segmentation\nfailures, e.g., incomplete objects, ambiguous boundaries, and distractor\nactivation. To this end, we propose a simple yet versatile framework in the\nspirit of divide-and-conquer. Specifically, a novel self-reasoning scheme is\nfirst implemented on the annotated support image, and then the coarse\nsegmentation mask is divided into multiple regions with different properties.\nLeveraging effective masked average pooling operations, a series of\nsupport-induced proxies are thus derived, each playing a specific role in\nconquering the above challenges. Moreover, we devise a unique parallel decoder\nstructure that integrates proxies with similar attributes to boost the\ndiscrimination power. Our proposed approach, named divide-and-conquer proxies\n(DCP), allows for the development of appropriate and reliable information as a\nguide at the \"episode\" level, not just about the object cues themselves.\nExtensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i demonstrate the superiority of\nDCP over conventional prototype-based approaches (up to 5~10% on average),\nwhich also establishes a new state-of-the-art.

    "title": "STFT-Domain Neural Speech Enhancement with Very Low Algorithmic Latency",
    "abstract": "Deep learning based speech enhancement in the short-term Fourier transform\n(STFT) domain typically uses a large window length such as 32 ms. A larger\nwindow contains more samples and the frequency resolution can be higher for\npotentially better enhancement. This however incurs an algorithmic latency of\n32 ms in an online setup, because the overlap-add algorithm used in the inverse\nSTFT (iSTFT) is also performed based on the same 32 ms window size. To reduce\nthis inherent latency, we adapt a conventional dual window size approach, where\na regular input window size is used for STFT but a shorter output window is\nused for the overlap-add in the iSTFT, for STFT-domain deep learning based\nframe-online speech enhancement. Based on this STFT and iSTFT configuration, we\nemploy single- or multi-microphone complex spectral mapping for frame-online\nenhancement, where a deep neural network (DNN) is trained to predict the real\nand imaginary (RI) components of target speech from the mixture RI components.\nIn addition, we use the RI components predicted by the DNN to conduct\nframe-online beamforming, the results of which are then used as extra features\nfor a second DNN to perform frame-online post-filtering. The frequency-domain\nbeamforming in between the two DNNs can be easily integrated with complex\nspectral mapping and is designed to not incur any algorithmic latency.\nAdditionally, we propose a future-frame prediction technique to further reduce\nthe algorithmic latency. Evaluation results on a noisy-reverberant speech\nenhancement task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.\nCompared with Conv-TasNet, our STFT-domain system can achieve better\nenhancement performance for a comparable amount of computation, or comparable\nperformance with less computation, maintaining strong performance at an\nalgorithmic latency as low as 2 ms.",

    "abstract": "LiDAR semantic segmentation essential for advanced autonomous driving is\nrequired to be accurate, fast, and easy-deployed on mobile platforms. Previous\npoint-based or sparse voxel-based methods are far away from real-time\napplications since time-consuming neighbor searching or sparse 3D convolution\nare employed. Recent 2D projection-based methods, including range view and\nmulti-view fusion, can run in real time, but suffer from lower accuracy due to\ninformation loss during the 2D projection. Besides, to improve the performance,\nprevious methods usually adopt test time augmentation (TTA), which further\nslows down the inference process. To achieve a better speed-accuracy trade-off,\nwe propose Cascade Point-Grid Fusion Network (CPGNet), which ensures both\neffectiveness and efficiency mainly by the following two techniques: 1) the\nnovel Point-Grid (PG) fusion block extracts semantic features mainly on the 2D\nprojected grid for efficiency, while summarizes both 2D and 3D features on 3D\npoint for minimal information loss; 2) the proposed transformation consistency\nloss narrows the gap between the single-time model inference and TTA. The\nexperiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that the\nCPGNet without ensemble models or TTA is comparable with the state-of-the-art\nRPVNet, while it runs 4.7 times faster.",

To address this\ngap, in this study, we examined three prominent location-based data sources:\nSpectus, X-Mode, and Veraset to analyze human mobility networks across\nmetropolitan areas at different scales: global, sub-structure, and microscopic.\nDissimilar results were obtained from the three datasets, suggesting the\nsensitivity of network models and measures to datasets. This finding has\nimportant implications for building generalized theories of human mobility and\nurban dynamics based on different datasets. The findings also highlighted the\nneed for ground-truthed human movement datasets to serve as the benchmark for\ntesting the representativeness of human mobility datasets.

After carefully handling the\nnoises in the feature learning, Our multi-scale knowledge distillation are\nproven to be very effective in the unsupervised re-identification. Extensive\nexperiments on three popular person re-identification datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method. Especially, our approach achieves a state-of-the-art\naccuracy 85.7% @mAP or 94.3% @Rank-1 on the challenging Market-1501 benchmark\nwith ResNet-50 under the fully unsupervised setting.",

    "abstract": "Background: The kidney exchange problem (KEP) addresses the matching of\npatients in need for a replacement organ with compatible living donors. Ideally\nmany medical institutions should participate in a matching program to increase\nthe chance for successful matches. However, to fulfill legal requirements\ncurrent systems use complicated policy-based data protection mechanisms that\neffectively exclude smaller medical facilities to participate. Employing secure\nmulti-party computation (MPC) techniques provides a technical way to satisfy\ndata protection requirements for highly sensitive personal health information\nwhile simultaneously reducing the regulatory burdens.\nResults: We have designed, implemented, and benchmarked SPIKE, a secure\nMPC-based privacy-preserving KEP which computes a solution by finding matching\ndonor-recipient pairs in a graph structure. SPIKE matches 40 pairs in cycles of\nlength 2 in less than 4 minutes and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art\nprotocol by a factor of 400x in runtime while providing medically more robust\nsolutions.\nConclusions: We show how to solve the KEP in a robust and privacy-preserving\nmanner achieving practical performance. The usage of MPC techniques fulfills\nmany data protection requirements on a technical level, allowing smaller health\ncare providers to directly participate in a kidney exchange with reduced legal\nprocesses.",

Efficient anomaly\ndetection models in the industrial sensor networks are essential for enhancing\nICS reliability and security, due to the sensor data is related to the\noperational state of the ICS. Considering the limited availability of computing\nresources, this paper proposes a hybrid anomaly detection approach in\ncloud-edge collaboration industrial sensor networks.

The sensor data detection model\nbased on Gaussian and Bayesian algorithms can detect the anomalous sensor data\nin real-time and upload them to the cloud for further analysis, filtering the\nnormal sensor data and reducing traffic load. The sensor data analysis model\nbased on Graph convolutional network, Residual algorithm and Long short-term\nmemory network (GCRL) can effectively extract the spatial and temporal features\nand then identify the attack precisely. The proposed hybrid anomaly detection\napproach is evaluated using a benchmark dataset and baseline anomaly detection\nmodels.

API\nmisuses are common in software projects, and while there have been techniques\nproposed to detect such misuses, studies have shown that they fail to reliably\ndetect misuses while reporting many false positives. One limitation of prior\nwork is the inability to reliably identify correct patterns of usage. Many\napproaches confuse a usage pattern's frequency for correctness. Due to the\nvariety of alternative usage patterns that may be uncommon but correct, anomaly\ndetection-based techniques have limited success in identifying misuses. We\naddress these challenges and propose ALP (Actively Learned Patterns),\nreformulating API misuse detection as a classification problem. After\nrepresenting programs as graphs, ALP mines discriminative subgraphs. While\nstill incorporating frequency information, through limited human supervision,\nwe reduce the reliance on the assumption relating frequency and correctness.\nThe principles of active learning are incorporated to shift human attention\naway from the most frequent patterns.

    "abstract": "A motif is a frequently occurring subgraph of a given directed or undirected\ngraph $G$. Motifs capture higher order organizational structure of $G$ beyond\nedge relationships, and, therefore, have found wide applications such as in\ngraph clustering, community detection, and analysis of biological and physical\nnetworks to name a few. In these applications, the cut structure of motifs\nplays a crucial role as vertices are partitioned into clusters by cuts whose\nconductance is based on the number of instances of a particular motif, as\nopposed to just the number of edges, crossing the cuts.\nIn this paper, we introduce the concept of a motif cut sparsifier. We show\nthat one can compute in polynomial time a sparse weighted subgraph $G'$ with\nonly $\\widetilde{O}(n/\\epsilon^2)$ edges such that for every cut, the weighted\nnumber of copies of $M$ crossing the cut in $G'$ is within a $1+\\epsilon$\nfactor of the number of copies of $M$ crossing the cut in $G$, for every\nconstant size motif $M$.\nOur work carefully combines the viewpoints of both graph sparsification and\nhypergraph sparsification. We sample edges which requires us to extend and\nstrengthen the concept of cut sparsifiers introduced in the seminal work of to\nthe motif setting. We adapt the importance sampling framework through the\nviewpoint of hypergraph sparsification by deriving the edge sampling\nprobabilities from the strong connectivity values of a hypergraph whose\nhyperedges represent motif instances. Finally, an iterative sparsification\nprimitive inspired by both viewpoints is used to reduce the number of edges in\n$G$ to nearly linear.\nIn addition, we present a strong lower bound ruling out a similar result for\nsparsification with respect to induced occurrences of motifs.",

However, their direct access to\nindividual patient experiences or patient-doctor interactions can be limited.\nInformation provided on social media, e.g., by patients and their relatives,\ncomplements the knowledge in scientific text. It reflects the patient's journey\nand their subjective perspective on the process of developing symptoms, being\ndiagnosed and offered a treatment, being cured or learning to live with a\nmedical condition. The value of this type of data is therefore twofold:\nFirstly, it offers direct access to people's perspectives. Secondly, it might\ncover information that is not available elsewhere, including self-treatment or\nself-diagnoses. Named entity recognition and relation extraction are methods to\nstructure information that is available in unstructured text. However, existing\nmedical social media corpora focused on a comparably small set of entities and\nrelations and particular domains, rather than putting the patient into the\ncenter of analyses. With this paper we contribute a corpus with a rich set of\nannotation layers following the motivation to uncover and model patients'\njourneys and experiences in more detail. We label 14 entity classes (incl.\nenvironmental factors, diagnostics, biochemical processes, patients'\nquality-of-life descriptions, pathogens, medical conditions, and treatments)\nand 20 relation classes (e.g., prevents, influences, interactions, causes) most\nof which have not been considered before for social media data.

A natural way towards\nthis goal is capturing only clinically disease-related features, which is\ncomposed of macroscopic attributes (e.g., margins, shapes) and microscopic\nimage-based features (e.g., textures) of lesion-related areas. However, such\ndisease-related features are often interweaved with data-dependent (but disease\nirrelevant) biases during learning, disabling the OOD generalization. To\nresolve this problem, we propose a novel framework, namely Domain Invariant\nModel with Graph Convolutional Network (DIM-GCN), which only exploits invariant\ndisease-related features from multiple domains. Specifically, we first propose\na Bayesian network, which explicitly decomposes the latent variables into\ndisease-related and other disease-irrelevant parts that are provable to be\ndisentangled from each other. Guided by this, we reformulate the objective\nfunction based on Variational Auto-Encoder, in which the encoder in each domain\nhas two branches: the domain-independent and -dependent ones, which\nrespectively encode disease-related and -irrelevant features. To better capture\nthe macroscopic features, we leverage the observed clinical attributes as a\ngoal for reconstruction, via Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Finally, we\nonly implement the disease-related features for prediction.

    "abstract": "The appearances of children are inherited from their parents, which makes it\nfeasible to predict them. Predicting realistic children's faces may help settle\nmany social problems, such as age-invariant face recognition, kinship\nverification, and missing child identification. It can be regarded as an\nimage-to-image translation task. Existing approaches usually assume domain\ninformation in the image-to-image translation can be interpreted by \"style\",\ni.e., the separation of image content and style. However, such separation is\nimproper for the child face prediction, because the facial contours between\nchildren and parents are not the same. To address this issue, we propose a new\ndisentangled learning strategy for children's face prediction. We assume that\nchildren's faces are determined by genetic factors (compact family features,\ne.g., face contour), external factors (facial attributes irrelevant to\nprediction, such as moustaches and glasses), and variety factors (individual\nproperties for each child). On this basis, we formulate predictions as a\nmapping from parents' genetic factors to children's genetic factors, and\ndisentangle them from external and variety factors. In order to obtain accurate\ngenetic factors and perform the mapping, we propose a ChildPredictor framework.\nIt transfers human faces to genetic factors by encoders and back by generators.\nThen, it learns the relationship between the genetic factors of parents and\nchildren through a mapping function. To ensure the generated faces are\nrealistic, we collect a large Family Face Database to train ChildPredictor and\nevaluate it on the FF-Database validation set. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat ChildPredictor is superior to other well-known image-to-image translation\nmethods in predicting realistic and diverse child faces.

    "title": "Transformer-Guided Convolutional Neural Network for Cross-View  Geolocalization",
    "abstract": "Ground-to-aerial geolocalization refers to localizing a ground-level query\nimage by matching it to a reference database of geo-tagged aerial imagery. This\nis very challenging due to the huge perspective differences in visual\nappearances and geometric configurations between these two views. In this work,\nwe propose a novel Transformer-guided convolutional neural network (TransGCNN)\narchitecture, which couples CNN-based local features with Transformer-based\nglobal representations for enhanced representation learning. Specifically, our\nTransGCNN consists of a CNN backbone extracting feature map from an input image\nand a Transformer head modeling global context from the CNN map. In particular,\nour Transformer head acts as a spatial-aware importance generator to select\nsalient CNN features as the final feature representation. Such a coupling\nprocedure allows us to leverage a lightweight Transformer network to greatly\nenhance the discriminative capability of the embedded features. Furthermore, we\ndesign a dual-branch Transformer head network to combine image features from\nmulti-scale windows in order to improve details of the global feature\nrepresentation. Extensive experiments on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat our model achieves top-1 accuracy of 94.12\\% and 84.92\\% on CVUSA and\nCVACT_val, respectively, which outperforms the second-performing baseline with\nless than 50% parameters and almost 2x higher frame rate, therefore achieving a\npreferable accuracy-efficiency tradeoff.",

    "abstract": "When suggesting Points of Interest (PoIs) to people with autism spectrum\ndisorders, we must take into account that they have idiosyncratic sensory\naversions to noise, brightness and other features that influence the way they\nperceive places. Therefore, recommender systems must deal with these aspects.\nHowever, the retrieval of sensory data about PoIs is a real challenge because\nmost geographical information servers fail to provide this data. Moreover,\nad-hoc crowdsourcing campaigns do not guarantee to cover large geographical\nareas and lack sustainability. Thus, we investigate the extraction of sensory\ndata about places from the consumer feedback collected by location-based\nservices, on which people spontaneously post reviews from all over the world.\nSpecifically, we propose a model for the extraction of sensory data from the\nreviews about PoIs, and its integration in recommender systems to predict item\nratings by considering both user preferences and compatibility information. We\ntested our approach with autistic and neurotypical people by integrating it\ninto diverse recommendation algorithms. For the test, we used a dataset built\nin a crowdsourcing campaign and another one extracted from TripAdvisor reviews.\nThe results show that the algorithms obtain the highest accuracy and ranking\ncapability when using TripAdvisor data. Moreover, by jointly using these two\ndatasets, the algorithms further improve their performance. These results\nencourage the use of consumer feedback as a reliable source of information\nabout places in the development of inclusive recommender systems.",

    "abstract": "The paper introduces and evaluates the concept of the dynamic interlining of\nbuses. Dynamic interlining is an operational strategy for routes that have a\nterminal station at a common hub, that allows a portion of (or all) the fleet\nto be shared among the routes belonging to the hub (shared fleet) as needed.\nThe shared fleet is dispatched on an on-demand basis to serve scheduled trips\non any route to avoid delays and regulate services. The paper examines\nsystematically the impacts of dynamic interlining on service reliability. It\nformulates the dispatching problem as an optimization problem and uses\nsimulation to evaluate the dynamic interlining strategy under a variety of\noperating conditions. Using bus routes in Boston Massachusetts Bay\nTransportation Authority (MBTA) as a case study, the feasibility of the\nstrategy, as well as factors that affect its performance are investigated.\nResults show that dynamic interlining can improve service reliability\n(increases on-time departures and decreases departure headways variability at\nthe hub). The fraction of the fleet that is shared has the most dominant impact\non performance. In the case where all buses are dynamically interlined, the\nperformance improves as route frequency increases and more routes participate\nin the strategy.",

We propose to feed different data samples\nwith varying quantization schemes to achieve a data-dependent dynamic\ninference, at a fine-grained layer level. However, enabling this adaptive\ninference with changeable layer-wise quantization schemes is challenging\nbecause the combination of bit-widths and layers is growing exponentially,\nmaking it extremely difficult to train a single model in such a vast searching\nspace and use it in practice. To solve this problem, we present the Arbitrary\nBit-width Network (ABN), where the bit-widths of a single deep network can\nchange at runtime for different data samples, with a layer-wise granularity.\nSpecifically, first we build a weight-shared layer-wise quantizable\n\"super-network\" in which each layer can be allocated with multiple bit-widths\nand thus quantized differently on demand. The super-network provides a\nconsiderably large number of combinations of bit-widths and layers, each of\nwhich can be used during inference without retraining or storing myriad models.\nSecond, based on the well-trained super-network, each layer's runtime bit-width\nselection decision is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved by\nan adaptive inference strategy accordingly.

Outliers are objects that are few in number\nand deviate from the majority of objects. As a result of these two properties,\nwe show that outliers are susceptible to a mechanism called fluctuation. This\narticle proposes a method called fluctuation-based outlier detection (FBOD)\nthat achieves a low linear time complexity and detects outliers purely based on\nthe concept of fluctuation without employing any distance, density or isolation\nmeasure. Fundamentally different from all existing methods. FBOD first converts\nthe Euclidean structure datasets into graphs by using random links, then\npropagates the feature value according to the connection of the graph. Finally,\nby comparing the difference between the fluctuation of an object and its\nneighbors, FBOD determines the object with a larger difference as an outlier.\nThe results of experiments comparing FBOD with seven state-of-the-art\nalgorithms on eight real-world tabular datasets and three video datasets show\nthat FBOD outperforms its competitors in the majority of cases and that FBOD\nhas only 5% of the execution time of the fastest algorithm.

Afterwards, we introduce a\nconstrained clustering algorithm to propagate the relationships of labeled\nsupport pairs to other unlabeled samples. Moreover, a hybrid learning strategy\nconsisting of an unsupervised contrastive loss and a supervised support pair\nloss is proposed to learn the discriminative re-id feature representation. The\nproposed overall framework can effectively lower the labeling cost by mining\nand leveraging the critical support pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art active learning\nmethods on large-scale person re-id benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "In healthcare prediction tasks, it is essential to exploit the correlations\nbetween medical features and learn better patient health representations.\nExisting methods try to estimate feature correlations only from data, or\nincrease the quality of estimation by introducing task-specific medical\nknowledge. However, such methods either are difficult to estimate the feature\ncorrelations due to insufficient training samples, or cannot be generalized to\nother tasks due to reliance on specific knowledge. There are medical research\nrevealing that not all the medical features are strongly correlated. Thus, to\naddress the issues, we expect to group up strongly correlated features and\nlearn feature correlations in a group-wise manner to reduce the learning\ncomplexity without losing generality. In this paper, we propose a general\npatient health representation learning framework MedFACT. We estimate\ncorrelations via measuring similarity between temporal patterns of medical\nfeatures with kernel methods, and cluster features with strong correlations\ninto groups. The feature group is further formulated as a correlation graph,\nand we employ graph convolutional networks to conduct group-wise feature\ninteractions for better representation learning. Experiments on two real-world\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of MedFACT. The discovered medical\nfindings are also confirmed by literature, providing valuable medical insights\nand explanations.",

    "abstract": "Huge pretrained language models (LMs) have demonstrated surprisingly good\nzero-shot capabilities on a wide variety of tasks. This gives rise to the\nappealing vision of a single, versatile model with a wide range of\nfunctionalities across disparate applications. However, current leading\ntechniques for leveraging a \"frozen\" LM -- i.e., leaving its weights untouched\n-- still often underperform fine-tuning approaches which modify these weights\nin a task-dependent way. Those, in turn, suffer forgetfulness and compromise\nversatility, suggesting a tradeoff between performance and versatility. The\nmain message of this paper is that current frozen-model techniques such as\nprompt tuning are only the tip of the iceberg, and more powerful methods for\nleveraging frozen LMs can do just as well as fine tuning in challenging domains\nwithout sacrificing the underlying model's versatility. To demonstrate this, we\nintroduce three novel methods for leveraging frozen models: input-dependent\nprompt tuning, frozen readers, and recursive LMs, each of which vastly improves\non current frozen-model approaches. Indeed, some of our methods even outperform\nfine-tuning approaches in domains currently dominated by the latter. The\ncomputational cost of each method is higher than that of existing frozen model\nmethods, but still negligible relative to a single pass through a huge frozen\nLM. Each of these methods constitutes a meaningful contribution in its own\nright, but by presenting these contributions together we aim to convince the\nreader of a broader message that goes beyond the details of any given method:\nthat frozen models have untapped potential and that fine-tuning is often\nunnecessary.",

Coverage-guided testing (CGT) is an approach that applies\nmutation or fuzzing according to a predefined coverage metric to find inputs\nthat cause misbehavior.

In this paper, a novel indexing approach called LIMS is proposed to\nuse data clustering and pivot-based data transformation techniques to build\nlearned indexes for efficient similarity query processing in metric spaces. The\nunderlying data is partitioned into clusters such that each cluster follows a\nrelatively uniform data distribution.

Efficient algorithms are designed for processing range queries and\nnearest neighbor queries based on LIMS, and for index maintenance with dynamic\nupdates.

The\nkey challenges in SVSR are preserving the stereo-consistency and\ntemporal-consistency, without which viewers may experience 3D fatigue. There\nare several notable works on stereoscopic image super-resolution, but there is\nlittle research on stereo video super-resolution. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Transformer-based model for SVSR, namely Trans-SVSR. Trans-SVSR comprises\ntwo key novel components: a spatio-temporal convolutional self-attention layer\nand an optical flow-based feed-forward layer that discovers the correlation\nacross different video frames and aligns the features. The parallax attention\nmechanism (PAM) that uses the cross-view information to consider the\nsignificant disparities is used to fuse the stereo views. Due to the lack of a\nbenchmark dataset suitable for the SVSR task, we collected a new stereoscopic\nvideo dataset, SVSR-Set, containing 71 full high-definition (HD) stereo videos\ncaptured using a professional stereo camera. Extensive experiments on the\ncollected dataset, along with two other datasets, demonstrate that the\nTrans-SVSR can achieve competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art\nmethods.

Lacking real bugs, most existing works construct\ntraining and test data by injecting synthetic bugs into correct programs.\nDespite achieving high test accuracy (e.g. >90%), the resulting bug detectors\nare found to be surprisingly unusable in practice, i.e., <10% precision when\nused to scan real software repositories. In this work, we argue that this\nmassive performance difference is caused by distribution shift, i.e., a\nfundamental mismatch between the real bug distribution and the synthetic bug\ndistribution used to train and evaluate the detectors. To address this key\nchallenge, we propose to train a bug detector in two phases, first on a\nsynthetic bug distribution to adapt the model to the bug detection domain, and\nthen on a real bug distribution to drive the model towards the real\ndistribution. During these two phases, we leverage a multi-task hierarchy,\nfocal loss, and contrastive learning to further boost performance. We evaluate\nour approach extensively on three widely studied bug types, for which we\nconstruct new datasets carefully designed to capture the real bug distribution.\nThe results demonstrate that our approach is practically effective and\nsuccessfully mitigates the distribution shift: our learned detectors are highly\nperformant on both our constructed test set and the latest version of open\nsource repositories.",

    "title": "Absolute Wrong Makes Better: Boosting Weakly Supervised Object Detection  via Negative Deterministic Information",
    "abstract": "Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) is a challenging task, in which\nimage-level labels (e.g., categories of the instances in the whole image) are\nused to train an object detector. Many existing methods follow the standard\nmultiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm and have achieved promising\nperformance. However, the lack of deterministic information leads to part\ndomination and missing instances. To address these issues, this paper focuses\non identifying and fully exploiting the deterministic information in WSOD. We\ndiscover that negative instances (i.e. absolutely wrong instances), ignored in\nmost of the previous studies, normally contain valuable deterministic\ninformation. Based on this observation, we here propose a negative\ndeterministic information (NDI) based method for improving WSOD, namely\nNDI-WSOD. Specifically, our method consists of two stages: NDI collecting and\nexploiting. In the collecting stage, we design several processes to identify\nand distill the NDI from negative instances online. In the exploiting stage, we\nutilize the extracted NDI to construct a novel negative contrastive learning\nmechanism and a negative guided instance selection strategy for dealing with\nthe issues of part domination and missing instances, respectively. Experimental\nresults on several public benchmarks including VOC 2007, VOC 2012 and MS COCO\nshow that our method achieves satisfactory performance.",

In this work, we study the victim node detection\nproblem under topology attacks against GNNs. Our approach is built upon the key\nobservation rooted in the intrinsic message passing nature of GNNs. That is,\nthe neighborhood of a victim node tends to have two competing group forces,\npushing the node classification results towards the original label and the\ntargeted label, respectively. Based on this observation, we propose to detect\nvictim nodes by deliberately designing an effective measurement of the\nneighborhood variance for each node.

    "abstract": "Predicting incoming failures and scheduling maintenance based on sensors\ninformation in industrial machines is increasingly important to avoid downtime\nand machine failure. Different machine learning formulations can be used to\nsolve the predictive maintenance problem. However, many of the approaches\nstudied in the literature are not directly applicable to real-life scenarios.\nIndeed, many of those approaches usually either rely on labelled machine\nmalfunctions in the case of classification and fault detection, or rely on\nfinding a monotonic health indicator on which a prediction can be made in the\ncase of regression and remaining useful life estimation, which is not always\nfeasible. Moreover, the decision-making part of the problem is not always\nstudied in conjunction with the prediction phase. This paper aims to design and\ncompare different formulations for predictive maintenance in a two-level\nframework and design metrics that quantify both the failure detection\nperformance as well as the timing of the maintenance decision. The first level\nis responsible for building a health indicator by aggregating features using a\nlearning algorithm. The second level consists of a decision-making system that\ncan trigger an alarm based on this health indicator. Three degrees of\nrefinements are compared in the first level of the framework, from simple\nthreshold-based univariate predictive technique to supervised learning methods\nbased on the remaining time before failure. We choose to use the Support Vector\nMachine (SVM) and its variations as the common algorithm used in all the\nformulations. We apply and compare the different strategies on a real-world\nrotating machine case study and observe that while a simple model can already\nperform well, more sophisticated refinements enhance the predictions for\nwell-chosen parameters.",

    "abstract": "With the booming growth of e-commerce, detecting financial fraud has become\nan urgent task to avoid transaction risks. Despite the successful application\nof graph neural networks in fraud detection, the existing solutions are only\nsuitable for a narrow scope due to the limitation of data collection.\nEspecially when expanding a business into new territory, e.g., new cities or\nnew countries, developing a totally new model will bring the cost issue and\nresult in forgetting previous knowledge. Besides, most existing GNNs-based\nsolutions concentrate on either homogeneous graphs or decomposing heterogeneous\ninteractions into several homogeneous connections for convenience. To this end,\nthis study proposes a novel solution based on heterogeneous trade graphs,\nnamely HTG-CFD, to prevent knowledge forgetting of cross-regional fraud\ndetection. In particular, the heterogeneous trade graph (HTG) is constructed\nfrom initial transaction records to explore the complex semantics among\ndifferent types of entities and relationships. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed HTG-CFD not only promotes the performance in\ncross-regional scenarios but also significantly contributes to the\nsingle-regional fraud detection.

To this\nend, we collected and analyzed various empirical evidence for data\ntriangulation. The results reflect that retro-inspection distinguishes itself\nfrom peer code review by identifying more complicated and underlying defects,\nproviding more indicative and suggestive comments. Many experienced inspectors\nindicate defects together with their rationale behind and offer suggestions for\ncorrection and prevention. As a result, retro-inspection can benefit not only\nquality assurance (like Fagan inspection), but also internal audit,\ninter-division communication, and competence promotion. On the other side, we\nidentify several lessons of retro-inspection at this stage, e.g., developers'\nacceptance and organizers' predicament, for next-step improvement of this\npractice. To be specific, some recommendations are discussed for\nretro-inspection, e.g., more adequate preparation and more careful publicity.\nThis study concludes that most of the expected benefits of retro-inspection can\nbe empirically confirmed in this enterprise and its value on the progress to\ncontinuous maturity can be recognized organization-wide.

    "abstract": "We propose a state-of-the-art method for super-resolution with non-uniform\nblur. Single-image super-resolution methods seek to restore a high-resolution\nimage from blurred, subsampled, and noisy measurements. Despite their\nimpressive performance, existing techniques usually assume a uniform blur\nkernel. Hence, these techniques do not generalize well to the more general case\nof non-uniform blur. Instead, in this paper, we address the more realistic and\ncomputationally challenging case of spatially-varying blur. To this end, we\nfirst propose a fast deep plug-and-play algorithm, based on linearized ADMM\nsplitting techniques, which can solve the super-resolution problem with\nspatially-varying blur. Second, we unfold our iterative algorithm into a single\nnetwork and train it end-to-end. In this way, we overcome the intricacy of\nmanually tuning the parameters involved in the optimization scheme. Our\nalgorithm presents remarkable performance and generalizes well after a single\ntraining to a large family of spatially-varying blur kernels, noise levels and\nscale factors.",

However, most of existing SSL methods use a\nuniform data augmentation scheme, which loses the sequence correlation of an\noriginal sequence. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Learnable Model\nAugmentation self-supervised learning for sequential Recommendation (LMA4Rec).\nSpecifically, LMA4Rec first takes model augmentation as a supplementary method\nfor data augmentation to generate views.

    "abstract": "We address the problem of inferring the anatomic skeleton of a person, in an\narbitrary pose, from the 3D surface of the body; i.e. we predict the inside\n(bones) from the outside (skin). This has many applications in medicine and\nbiomechanics. Existing state-of-the-art biomechanical skeletons are detailed\nbut do not easily generalize to new subjects. Additionally, computer vision and\ngraphics methods that predict skeletons are typically heuristic, not learned\nfrom data, do not leverage the full 3D body surface, and are not validated\nagainst ground truth. To our knowledge, our system, called OSSO (Obtaining\nSkeletal Shape from Outside), is the first to learn the mapping from the 3D\nbody surface to the internal skeleton from real data. We do so using 1000 male\nand 1000 female dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. To these, we fit\na parametric 3D body shape model (STAR) to capture the body surface and a novel\npart-based 3D skeleton model to capture the bones. This provides inside/outside\ntraining pairs. We model the statistical variation of full skeletons using PCA\nin a pose-normalized space. We then train a regressor from body shape\nparameters to skeleton shape parameters and refine the skeleton to satisfy\nconstraints on physical plausibility. Given an arbitrary 3D body shape and\npose, OSSO predicts a realistic skeleton inside. In contrast to previous work,\nwe evaluate the accuracy of the skeleton shape quantitatively on held-out DXA\nscans, outperforming the state-of-the-art. We also show 3D skeleton prediction\nfrom varied and challenging 3D bodies. The code to infer a skeleton from a body\nshape is available for research at https://osso.is.tue.mpg.de/, and the dataset\nof paired outer surface (skin) and skeleton (bone) meshes is available as a\nBiobank Returned Dataset.

In this paper, we develop a new\nSelf-Calibrated Illumination (SCI) learning framework for fast, flexible, and\nrobust brightening images in real-world low-light scenarios. To be specific, we\nestablish a cascaded illumination learning process with weight sharing to\nhandle this task. Considering the computational burden of the cascaded pattern,\nwe construct the self-calibrated module which realizes the convergence between\nresults of each stage, producing the gains that only use the single basic block\nfor inference (yet has not been exploited in previous works), which drastically\ndiminishes computation cost.

Equipped with this\nbenchmark, we delve into million-scale face recognition problems.

By comparing lipid\nangle measurements between two analysts following editing of our automated\nsoftware, we found good agreement by Bland-Altman analysis (difference 6.7+/-17\ndegree; mean 196 degree). Our method accurately detected the fibrous cap from\nthe detected lipid plaque. Automated analysis required a significant\nmodification for only 5.5% frames. Furthermore, our method showed a good\nagreement of fibrous cap thickness between two analysts with Bland-Altman\nanalysis (4.2+/-14.6 micron; mean 175 micron), indicating little bias between\nusers and good reproducibility of the measurement.

    "abstract": "We propose an energy-based framework to analyze the statics and dynamics of a\nferroelectric negative capacitance-hybrid Microelectromechanical System (MEMS)\nactuator. A mapping function that relates the charge on the ferroelectric to\ndisplacement of the movable electrode, is used to obtain the Hamiltonian of the\nhybrid actuator in terms of displacement. We then use graphical\nenergy-displacement and phase portrait plots to analyze static pull-in, dynamic\npull-in and pull-out phenomena of the hybrid actuator. Using these, we\nillustrate the low-voltage operation of the hybrid actuator to static and step\ninputs, as compared to the standalone MEMS actuator. The results obtained are\nin agreement with the analytical predictions and numerical simulations. The\nproposed framework enables straightforward inclusion of adhesion between the\ncontacting surfaces, modeled using van der Waals force. We show that the\npull-in voltage is not affected, while the pull-out voltage is reduced due to\nadhesion. The proposed framework provides a physics-based tool to design and\nanalyze negative capacitance based low-voltage MEMS actuators.",

On such resource-constrained devices, manufacturers\nstill manage to provide attractive functionalities (to boost sales) by\nfollowing the traditional approach of programming IoT devices/products to\ncollect and transmit data (image, audio, sensor readings, etc.) to their\ncloud-based ML analytics platforms. For decades, this online approach has been\nfacing issues such as compromised data streams, non-real-time analytics due to\nlatency, bandwidth constraints, costly subscriptions, recent privacy issues\nraised by users and the GDPR guidelines, etc. In this paper, to enable\nultra-fast and accurate AI-based offline analytics on resource-constrained IoT\ndevices, we present an end-to-end multi-component model optimization sequence\nand open-source its implementation. Researchers and developers can use our\noptimization sequence to optimize high memory, computation demanding models in\nmultiple aspects in order to produce small size, low latency, low-power\nconsuming models that can comfortably fit and execute on resource-constrained\nhardware. The experimental results show that our optimization components can\nproduce models that are; (i) 12.06 x times compressed; (ii) 0.13% to 0.27% more\naccurate; (iii) Orders of magnitude faster unit inference at 0.06 ms.

INSPIRE makes no explicit assumptions about the topology of WLANs and\nfavors altruistic behaviors of the access points, leading them to find adequate\nconfigurations of their TX_POWER and OBSS_PD parameters for the \"greater good\"\nof the WLANs.

And along this way, the key to find the\noptimal strategy for disease control is to obtain a large number of simulations\nof disease transitions under different scenarios. Therefore, the models that\ncan simulate the spreading of diseases under scenarios closer to the reality\nand are with high efficiency are preferred. In the realistic social networks,\nthe random contact, including contacts between people in the public places and\nthe public transits, becomes the important access for the spreading of\ninfectious diseases. In this paper, a model can efficiently simulate the\nspreading of infectious diseases under random contacts is proposed. In this\napproach, the random contact between people is characterized by the random\nmatrix with elements randomly generated and the spread of the diseases is\nsimulated by the Markov process. We report an interesting property of the\nproposed model: the main indicators of the spreading of the diseases such as\nthe death rate are invariant of the size of the population. Therefore,\nrepresentative simulations can be conducted on models consist of small number\nof populations. The main advantage of this model is that it can easily simulate\nthe spreading of diseases under more realistic scenarios and thus is able to\ngive a large number of simulations needed for the searching of the optimal\ncontrol strategy.

When applied to conversational UIs, active listening from\nmachines can also elicit greater self-disclosure by signaling to the users that\nthey are being heard, which can have positive outcomes. However, it takes\nconsiderable engineering effort and training to embed active listening skills\nin machines at scale, given the need to personalize active-listening cues to\nindividual users and their specific utterances. A more generic solution is\nneeded given the increasing use of conversational agents, especially by the\ngrowing number of socially isolated individuals. With this in mind, we\ndeveloped an Amazon Alexa skill that provides privacy-preserving and\npseudo-random backchanneling to indicate active listening. User study (N = 40)\ndata show that backchanneling improves perceived degree of active listening by\nsmart speakers. It also results in more emotional disclosure, with participants\nusing more positive words. Perception of smart speakers as active listeners is\npositively associated with perceived emotional support.

This work examines what differences result when porting these image\ndesigned strategies to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks - these\ndetectors are found to not port over well.

However,\ndespite having a lot of diversity and millions of native speakers, some\nlanguages such as Bengali are under-resourced, which is due to a lack of\ncomputational resources for natural language processing (NLP). Like English,\nBengali social media content also includes images along with texts (e.g.,\nmultimodal contents are posted by embedding short texts into images on\nFacebook), only the textual data is not enough to judge them (e.g., to\ndetermine they are hate speech). In those cases, images might give extra\ncontext to properly judge. This paper is about hate speech detection from\nmultimodal Bengali memes and texts. We prepared the only multimodal hate speech\ndetection dataset1 for a kind of problem for Bengali. We train several neural\narchitectures (i.e., neural networks like Bi-LSTM/Conv-LSTM with word\nembeddings, EfficientNet + transformer architectures such as monolingual Bangla\nBERT, multilingual BERT-cased/uncased, and XLM-RoBERTa) jointly analyze textual\nand visual information for hate speech detection. The Conv-LSTM and XLM-RoBERTa\nmodels performed best for texts, yielding F1 scores of 0.78 and 0.82,\nrespectively. As of memes, ResNet152 and DenseNet201 models yield F1 scores of\n0.78 and 0.7, respectively. The multimodal fusion of mBERT-uncased +\nEfficientNet-B1 performed the best, yielding an F1 score of 0.80.

    "abstract": "Many recent models in software engineering introduced deep neural models\nbased on the Transformer architecture or use transformer-based Pre-trained\nLanguage Models (PLM) trained on code. Although these models achieve the state\nof the arts results in many downstream tasks such as code summarization and bug\ndetection, they are based on Transformer and PLM, which are mainly studied in\nthe Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. The current studies rely on the\nreasoning and practices from NLP for these models in code, despite the\ndifferences between natural languages and programming languages. There is also\nlimited literature on explaining how code is modeled.\nHere, we investigate the attention behavior of PLM on code and compare it\nwith natural language. We pre-trained BERT, a Transformer based PLM, on code\nand explored what kind of information it learns, both semantic and syntactic.\nWe run several experiments to analyze the attention values of code constructs\non each other and what BERT learns in each layer. Our analyses show that BERT\npays more attention to syntactic entities, specifically identifiers and\nseparators, in contrast to the most attended token [CLS] in NLP. This\nobservation motivated us to leverage identifiers to represent the code sequence\ninstead of the [CLS] token when used for code clone detection. Our results show\nthat employing embeddings from identifiers increases the performance of BERT by\n605% and 4% F1-score in its lower layers and the upper layers, respectively.\nWhen identifiers' embeddings are used in CodeBERT, a code-based PLM, the\nperformance is improved by 21-24% in the F1-score of clone detection. The\nfindings can benefit the research community by using code-specific\nrepresentations instead of applying the common embeddings used in NLP, and open\nnew directions for developing smaller models with similar performance.",

    "abstract": "Human languages use a wide range of grammatical categories to constrain which\nwords or phrases can fill certain slots in grammatical patterns and to express\nadditional meanings, such as tense or aspect, through morpho-syntactic means.\nThese grammatical categories, which are most often language-specific and\nchanging over time, are difficult to define and learn. This paper raises the\nquestion how these categories can be acquired and where they have come from. We\nexplore a usage-based approach. This means that categories and grammatical\nconstructions are selected and aligned by their success in language\ninteractions. We report on a multi-agent experiment in which agents are endowed\nwith mechanisms for understanding and producing utterances as well as\nmechanisms for expanding their inventories using a meta-level learning process\nbased on pro- and anti-unification.

    "abstract": "The task of 2D human pose estimation is challenging as the number of\nkeypoints is typically large (~ 17) and this necessitates the use of robust\nneural network architectures and training pipelines that can capture the\nrelevant features from the input image.

Many papers in literature use CNN-based architectures\nfor the backbone, and/or combine it with a transformer, after which the\nfeatures are aggregated to make the final keypoint predictions [1]. In this\npaper, we consider the recently proposed Bottleneck Transformers [2], which\ncombine CNN and multi-head self attention (MHSA) layers effectively, and we\nintegrate it with a Transformer encoder and apply it to the task of 2D human\npose estimation. We consider different backbone architectures and pre-train\nthem using the DINO self-supervised learning method [3], this pre-training is\nfound to improve the overall prediction accuracy. We call our model BTranspose,\nand experiments show that on the COCO validation set, our model achieves an AP\nof 76.4, which is competitive with other methods such as [1] and has fewer\nnetwork parameters.

Various architecture configurations with series\nand parallel connections are considered based on RNNs and CNNs, and several\nprevalent data imputation techniques are used to examine the robustness of the\nhybrid networks to missing values. A comprehensive analysis performed on two\ndifferent datasets from PeMS indicates that the proposed series-parallel hybrid\nnetwork with the mean imputation technique achieves the lowest error in\npredicting the traffic flow and is robust to missing values up until 21%\nmissing ratio in both complete and incomplete training data scenarios when\napplied to an incomplete test data.",

Many TPL detection methods have been proposed to detect TPL reuse in\nAndroid bytecode or in source code. This paper focuses on detecting TPL reuse\nin binary code, which is a more challenging task. For a detection target in\nbinary form, libraries may be compiled and linked to separate dynamic-link\nfiles or built into a fused binary that contains multiple libraries and\nproject-specific code. This could result in fewer available code features and\nlower the effectiveness of feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a\nbinary TPL reuse detection framework, LibDB, which can effectively and\nefficiently detect imported TPLs even in stripped and fused binaries. In\naddition to the basic and coarse-grained features (string literals and exported\nfunction names), LibDB utilizes function contents as a new type of feature. It\nembeds all functions in a binary file to low-dimensional representations with a\ntrained neural network. It further adopts a function call graph-based\ncomparison method to improve the accuracy of the detection. LibDB is able to\nsupport version identification of TPLs contained in the detection target, which\nis not considered by existing detection methods. To evaluate the performance of\nLibDB, we construct three datasets for binary-based TPL reuse detection. Our\nexperimental results show that LibDB is more accurate and efficient than\nstate-of-the-art tools on the binary TPL detection task and the version\nidentification task.

    "title": "A Sandbox Tool to Bias(Stress)-Test Fairness Algorithms",
    "abstract": "Motivated by the growing importance of reducing unfairness in ML predictions,\nFair-ML researchers have presented an extensive suite of algorithmic\n\"fairness-enhancing\" remedies. Most existing algorithms, however, are agnostic\nto the sources of the observed unfairness. As a result, the literature\ncurrently lacks guiding frameworks to specify conditions under which each\nalgorithmic intervention can potentially alleviate the underpinning cause of\nunfairness. To close this gap, we scrutinize the underlying biases (e.g., in\nthe training data or design choices) that cause observational unfairness. We\npresent a bias-injection sandbox tool to investigate fairness consequences of\nvarious biases and assess the effectiveness of algorithmic remedies in the\npresence of specific types of bias. We call this process the\nbias(stress)-testing of algorithmic interventions. Unlike existing toolkits,\nours provides a controlled environment to counterfactually inject biases in the\nML pipeline. This stylized setup offers the distinct capability of testing\nfairness interventions beyond observational data and against an unbiased\nbenchmark. In particular, we can test whether a given remedy can alleviate the\ninjected bias by comparing the predictions resulting after the intervention in\nthe biased setting with true labels in the unbiased regime -- that is, before\nany bias injection. We illustrate the utility of our toolkit via a\nproof-of-concept case study on synthetic data. Our empirical analysis showcases\nthe type of insights that can be obtained through our simulations.",

The following four\nproperties of their game forms are equivalent: (i) Nash-solvability, (ii)\nzero-sum-solvability, (iii) win-lose-solvability, and (iv) tightness. For (ii,\niii, iv) this was shown by Edmonds and Fulkerson in 1970. Then, in 1975, (i)\nwas added to this list and it was also shown that these results cannot be\ngeneralized for $n$-person case with $n > 2$. In 1990, tightness was extended\nto vector game forms ($v$-forms) and it was shown that such $v$-tightness and\nzero-sum-solvability are still equivalent, yet, do not imply Nash-solvability.\nThese results are applicable to several classes of stochastic games with\nperfect information. Here we suggest one more extension of tightness\nintroducing $v^+$-tight vector game forms ($v^+$-forms). We show that such\n$v^+$-tightness and Nash-solvability are equivalent in case of weakly\nrectangular game forms and positive cost functions. This result allows us to\nreduce the so-called bi-shortest path conjecture to $v^+$-tightness of\n$v^+$-forms. However, both (equivalent) statements remain open.",

    "abstract": "Translation distance based knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods, such as\nTransE and RotatE, model the relation in knowledge graphs as translation or\nrotation in the vector space. Both translation and rotation are injective; that\nis, the translation or rotation of different vectors results in different\nresults. In knowledge graphs, different entities may have a relation with the\nsame entity; for example, many actors starred in one movie. Such a\nnon-injective relation pattern cannot be well modeled by the translation or\nrotation operations in existing translation distance based KGE methods. To\ntackle the challenge, we propose a translation distance-based KGE method called\nSpaceE to model relations as linear transformations. The proposed SpaceE embeds\nboth entities and relations in knowledge graphs as matrices and SpaceE\nnaturally models non-injective relations with singular linear transformations.\nWe theoretically demonstrate that SpaceE is a fully expressive model with the\nability to infer multiple desired relation patterns, including symmetry,\nskew-symmetry, inversion, Abelian composition, and non-Abelian composition.\nExperimental results on link prediction datasets illustrate that SpaceE\nsubstantially outperforms many previous translation distance based knowledge\ngraph embedding methods, especially on datasets with many non-injective\nrelations.

    "abstract": "Actor-critic algorithms that make use of distributional policy evaluation\nhave frequently been shown to outperform their non-distributional counterparts\non many challenging control tasks. Examples of this behavior include the D4PG\nand DMPO algorithms as compared to DDPG and MPO, respectively [Barth-Maron et\nal., 2018; Hoffman et al., 2020]. However, both agents rely on the C51 critic\nfor value estimation.One major drawback of the C51 approach is its requirement\nof prior knowledge about the minimum andmaximum values a policy can attain as\nwell as the number of bins used, which fixes the resolution ofthe\ndistributional estimate. While the DeepMind control suite of tasks utilizes\nstandardized rewards and episode lengths, thus enabling the entire suite to be\nsolved with a single setting of these hyperparameters, this is often not the\ncase. This paper revisits a natural alternative that removes this requirement,\nnamelya mixture of Gaussians, and a simple sample-based loss function to train\nit in an off-policy regime. We empirically evaluate its performance on a broad\nrange of continuous control tasks and demonstrate that it eliminates the need\nfor these distributional hyperparameters and achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on a variety of challenging tasks (e.g. the humanoid, dog,\nquadruped, and manipulator domains).

A recent trend is in the development of intervention tools that\npredict BMI using facial images for weight monitoring and management to combat\nobesity. Most of these studies used BMI annotated facial image datasets that\nmainly consisted of Caucasian subjects. Research on bias evaluation of\nface-based gender-, age-classification, and face recognition systems suggest\nthat these technologies perform poorly for women, dark-skinned people, and\nolder adults. The bias of facial analysis-based BMI prediction tools has not\nbeen studied until now. This paper evaluates the bias of facial-analysis-based\nBMI prediction models across Caucasian and African-American Males and Females.\nExperimental investigations on the gender, race, and BMI balanced version of\nthe modified MORPH-II dataset suggested that the error rate in BMI prediction\nwas least for Black Males and highest for White Females. Further, the\npsychology-related facial features correlated with weight suggested that as the\nBMI increases, the changes in the facial region are more prominent for Black\nMales and the least for White Females. This is the reason for the least error\nrate of the facial analysis-based BMI prediction tool for Black Males and\nhighest for White Females.",

The\napproach first expresses a constraint for the TT task schedule in the form of a\nmaximal affine envelope that guarantees that as long as the schedule generation\nrespects this envelope, all sporadic ET tasks meet their deadline. The second\nstep consists of modeling this envelope as a burst limiting constraint and\nbuilding the TT schedule via simulating a modified Least-Laxity-First (LLF)\nscheduler. Using this novel technique, we show that we achieve equal or better\nschedulability and a faster schedule generation for most use-cases compared to\nother approaches inspired by, e.g., hierarchical scheduling.

    "abstract": "Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT)-based tools for network control plane\nanalysis make it possible to reason exhaustively about interactions with peer\nnetworks and to detect vulnerabilities such as accidental use of a network as\ntransit or prefix hijacking. SMT-based reasoning also facilitates synthesis and\nrepair. To scale SMT-based verification to large networks, we introduce\nTimepiece, a new modular control plane verification system. While past\nverifiers like Minesweeper were based on analysis of stable paths, we show that\nsuch models, when deployed naively in service of modular verification, are\nunsound. To rectify the situation, we adopt a routing model based around a\nlogical notion of time and develop a sound, expressive, and scalable\nverification engine. Our system requires that a user specifies interfaces\nbetween module components. We develop methods for defining these interfaces\nusing predicates inspired by temporal logic, and show how to use those\ninterfaces to verify a range of network-wide properties such as reachability,\n\"no transit,\" and \"no hijacking.\" Verifying a prefix-filtering policy using a\nnon-modular verification engine times out on a 320-node fattree network after 4\nhours. However, Timepiece verifies a 4,500-node fattree in 6.5 minutes on a\n96-core virtual machine. Modular verification of individual routers is\nembarrassingly parallel and completes in seconds, which allows verification to\nscale beyond non-modular engines, while still allowing the full power of\nSMT-based symbolic reasoning.",

    "abstract": "A recent paper (Hedden 2021) has argued that most of the group fairness\nconstraints discussed in the machine learning literature are not necessary\nconditions for the fairness of predictions, and hence that there are no genuine\nfairness metrics. This is proven by discussing a special case of a fair\nprediction. In our paper, we show that Hedden 's argument does not hold for the\nmost common kind of predictions used in data science, which are about people\nand based on data from similar people; we call these human-group-based\npractices. We argue that there is a morally salient distinction between\nhuman-group-based practices and those that are based on data of only one\nperson, which we call human-individual-based practices. Thus, what may be a\nnecessary condition for the fairness of human-group-based practices may not be\na necessary condition for the fairness of human-individual-based practices, on\nwhich Hedden 's argument is based.

    "abstract": "Self-adaptive systems frequently use tactics to perform adaptations. Tactic\nexamples include the implementation of additional security measures when an\nintrusion is detected, or activating a cooling mechanism when temperature\nthresholds are surpassed. Tactic volatility occurs in real-world systems and is\ndefined as variable behavior in the attributes of a tactic, such as its latency\nor cost. A system's inability to effectively account for tactic volatility\nadversely impacts its efficiency and resiliency against the dynamics of\nreal-world environments. To enable systems' efficiency against tactic\nvolatility, we propose a Tactic Volatility Aware (TVA-E) process utilizing\nevolved Recurrent Neural Networks (eRNN) to provide accurate tactic\npredictions. TVA-E is also the first known process to take advantage of\nuncertainty reduction tactics to provide additional information to the\ndecision-making process and reduce uncertainty. TVA-E easily integrates into\npopular adaptation processes enabling it to immediately benefit a large number\nof existing self-adaptive systems. Simulations using 52,106 tactic records\ndemonstrate that: I) eRNN is an effective prediction mechanism, II) TVA-E\nrepresents an improvement over existing state-of-the-art processes in\naccounting for tactic volatility, and III) Uncertainty reduction tactics are\nbeneficial in accounting for tactic volatility.

    "abstract": "Approaches to single-view reconstruction typically rely on viewpoint\nannotations, silhouettes, the absence of background, multiple views of the same\ninstance, a template shape, or symmetry. We avoid all of these supervisions and\nhypotheses by leveraging explicitly the consistency between images of different\nobject instances. As a result, our method can learn from large collections of\nunlabelled images depicting the same object category. Our main contributions\nare two approaches to leverage cross-instance consistency: (i) progressive\nconditioning, a training strategy to gradually specialize the model from\ncategory to instances in a curriculum learning fashion; (ii) swap\nreconstruction, a loss enforcing consistency between instances having similar\nshape or texture. Critical to the success of our method are also: our\nstructured autoencoding architecture decomposing an image into explicit shape,\ntexture, pose, and background; an adapted formulation of differential\nrendering, and; a new optimization scheme alternating between 3D and pose\nlearning. We compare our approach, UNICORN, both on the diverse synthetic\nShapeNet dataset - the classical benchmark for methods requiring multiple views\nas supervision - and on standard real-image benchmarks (Pascal3D+ Car, CUB-200)\nfor which most methods require known templates and silhouette annotations.

One key challenge for designing and optimizing these\ngeometrically complicated structures lies in devising an effective geometric\nrepresentation to characterize the system's spatially varying cellular\nevolution driven by objective sensitivities. A conventional discrete cellular\nstructure, e.g., a Voronoi diagram, whose representation relies on discrete\nVoronoi cells and faces, lacks its differentiability to facilitate large-scale,\ngradient-based topology optimizations. We propose a topology optimization\nalgorithm based on a differentiable and generalized Voronoi representation that\ncan evolve the cellular structure as a continuous field.

In this work, we present a simple\nnew anomaly detection algorithm called FADS (feature-based anomaly detection\nsystem) which leverages pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNN) to\ngenerate a statistical model of nominal inputs by observing the activation of\nthe convolutional filters. During inference the system compares the\nconvolutional filter activation of the new input to the statistical model and\nflags activations that are outside the expected range of values and therefore\nlikely an anomaly. By using a pretrained network, FADS demonstrates excellent\nperformance similar to or better than other machine learning approaches to\nanomaly detection while at the same time FADS requires no tuning of the CNN\nweights. We demonstrate FADS ability by detecting process parameter changes on\na custom dataset of additively manufactured lattices.

It also optimizes the data movement by adopting\nvectorized, quantized and fused locality-aware memory access, reducing the\nmemory movement cost by 2.7x.

However, it is difficult to\ndirectly leverage such large amounts of unlabeled and highly diverse data for\ncomplex 3D reasoning and planning tasks. Consequently, researchers have\nprimarily focused on its use for various auxiliary pixel- and image-level\ncomputer vision tasks that do not consider an ultimate navigational objective.\nIn this work, we introduce SelfD, a framework for learning scalable driving by\nutilizing large amounts of online monocular images. Our key idea is to leverage\niterative semi-supervised training when learning imitative agents from\nunlabeled data. To handle unconstrained viewpoints, scenes, and camera\nparameters, we train an image-based model that directly learns to plan in the\nBird's Eye View (BEV) space. Next, we use unlabeled data to augment the\ndecision-making knowledge and robustness of an initially trained model via\nself-training.

    "abstract": "Given an increasingly volatile climate, the relationship between weather and\ntransit ridership has drawn increasing interest. However, challenges stemming\nfrom spatio-temporal dependency and non-stationarity have not been fully\naddressed in modelling and predicting transit ridership under the influence of\nweather conditions especially with the traditional statistical approaches.\nDrawing on three-month smart card data in Brisbane, Australia, this research\nadopts and assesses a suite of machine-learning algorithms, i.e., random\nforest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Tweedie XGBoost, to model and\npredict near real-time bus ridership in relation to sudden change of weather\nconditions. The study confirms that there indeed exists a significant level of\nspatio-temporal variability of weather-ridership relationship, which produces\nequally dynamic patterns of prediction errors. Further comparison of model\nperformance suggests that Tweedie XGBoost outperforms the other two\nmachine-learning algorithms in generating overall more accurate prediction\noutcomes in space and time. Future research may advance the current study by\ndrawing on larger data sets and applying more advanced machine and\ndeep-learning approaches to provide more enhanced evidence for real-time\noperation of transit systems.",

    "abstract": "We introduce an unsupervised clustering algorithm to improve training\nefficiency and accuracy in predicting energies using molecular-orbital-based\nmachine learning (MOB-ML). This work determines clusters via the Gaussian\nmixture model (GMM) in an entirely automatic manner and simplifies an earlier\nsupervised clustering approach [J. Chem. Theory Comput., 15, 6668 (2019)] by\neliminating both the necessity for user-specified parameters and the training\nof an additional classifier. Unsupervised clustering results from GMM have the\nadvantage of accurately reproducing chemically intuitive groupings of frontier\nmolecular orbitals and having improved performance with an increasing number of\ntraining examples. The resulting clusters from supervised or unsupervised\nclustering is further combined with scalable Gaussian process regression (GPR)\nor linear regression (LR) to learn molecular energies accurately by generating\na local regression model in each cluster. Among all four combinations of\nregressors and clustering methods, GMM combined with scalable exact Gaussian\nprocess regression (GMM/GPR) is the most efficient training protocol for\nMOB-ML. The numerical tests of molecular energy learning on thermalized\ndatasets of drug-like molecules demonstrate the improved accuracy,\ntransferability, and learning efficiency of GMM/GPR over not only other\ntraining protocols for MOB-ML, i.e., supervised regression-clustering combined\nwith GPR(RC/GPR) and GPR without clustering. GMM/GPR also provide the best\nmolecular energy predictions compared with the ones from literature on the same\nbenchmark datasets. With a lower scaling, GMM/GPR has a 10.4-fold speedup in\nwall-clock training time compared with scalable exact GPR with a training size\nof 6500 QM7b-T molecules.",

QKD\nnetworks based trusted relay architecture are now the most widely used scheme\nin practice. However, it is an unrealistic assumption that all relays are fully\ntrustable in complex networks. In the past, only a few studies have\ntheoretically analyzed the case of passive eavesdropping attack by dishonest\nrelays and corresponding defense method. However, we have found that active\nattacks by dishonest relays can be more threatening. With the consideration of\npassive and active attacks, we treat dishonest relays as Byzantine nodes and\nanalyzes the upper limit of Byzantine nodes that the QKD network can\naccommodate. In this paper, we propose an ITS Byzantine-fault tolerance (BFT)\nQKD network scheme to achieve end-to-end key distribution based on\npoint-to-point QKD links. To ensure consistency and provide BFT ability in the\nQKD network, we design an ITSBFT-consensus protocol for this network scheme. To\nensure the information-theoretic security of consensus, we design a temporary\nsignature scheme based on point-to-point QKD link keys. To prevent Byzantine\nnodes from disrupting the execution process of key distribution, we design an\nend-to-end key distribution scheme combined with consensus. We theoretically\nanalyze proposed ITSBFT-QKD network scheme from four aspects: QKD key\ndistribution security, temporary signature security, consensus security, and\nleader election fairness. The simulation result proved the feasibility and\ndemonstrate the performance.",

    "abstract": "Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have recently achieved\nleading performances in many generative tasks. However, the inherited iterative\nsampling process costs hindered their applications to speech synthesis. This\npaper proposes FastDiff, a fast conditional diffusion model for high-quality\nspeech synthesis. FastDiff employs a stack of time-aware location-variable\nconvolutions of diverse receptive field patterns to efficiently model long-term\ntime dependencies with adaptive conditions. A noise schedule predictor is also\nadopted to reduce the sampling steps without sacrificing the generation\nquality. Based on FastDiff, we design an end-to-end text-to-speech synthesizer,\nFastDiff-TTS, which generates high-fidelity speech waveforms without any\nintermediate feature (e.g., Mel-spectrogram). Our evaluation of FastDiff\ndemonstrates the state-of-the-art results with higher-quality (MOS 4.28) speech\nsamples. Also, FastDiff enables a sampling speed of 58x faster than real-time\non a V100 GPU, making diffusion models practically applicable to speech\nsynthesis deployment for the first time. We further show that FastDiff\ngeneralized well to the mel-spectrogram inversion of unseen speakers, and\nFastDiff-TTS outperformed other competing methods in end-to-end text-to-speech\nsynthesis.

Having in mind the\napplication to their quasi static evolutions, we adopt a Lagrangian formulation\nof our own devising, in which we solve force balance equations to seek for the\npositions of fluid elements assigned to the grid points, instead of the\nordinary Eulerian formulation. Unlike previous works in the literature, we do\nnot employ the first integral of the Euler equation, which is not obtained by\nan analytic integration in general. We assign a mass, specific angular momentum\nand entropy to each fluid element in contrast to the previous methods, in which\nthe spatial distribution of the angular velocity or angular momentum is\nspecified. Those distributions are determined after the positions of all fluid\nelements (or grid points) are derived in our formulation. We solve the large\nsystem of algebraic nonlinear equations that are obtained by discretizing the\ntime-independent Euler and Einstein equations in the finite-elements method by\nusing our new multi-dimensional root-finding scheme, named the W4 method. To\ndemonstrate the capability of our new formulation, we construct some rotational\nconfigurations both barotropic and baroclinic.

The proposed method is based on the least-square\nshadowing (LSS) approach [1], that formulates the evaluation of sensitivities\nas an optimisation problem, thereby avoiding the exponential growth of the\nsolution. However, all existing formulations of LSS (and its variants) are in\nthe time domain and the computational cost scales with the number of positive\nLyapunov exponents.

The new method is tested on the\nKuramoto-Sivashinski system and the results match with those obtained using the\nstandard time-domain formulation. Although the cost of the direct solution is\nindependent of the number of positive Lyapunov exponents, storage and computing\nrequirements grow rapidly with the size of the system.

    "title": "Multi-UAV trajectory planning for 3D visual inspection of complex  structures",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a new trajectory planning algorithm for 3D autonomous UAV\nvolume coverage and visual inspection. The algorithm is an extension of a\nstate-of-the-art Heat Equation Driven Area Coverage (HEDAC) multi-agent area\ncoverage algorithm for 3D domains. With a given target exploration density\nfield, the algorithm designs a potential field and directs UAVs to the regions\nof higher potential, i.e., higher values of remaining density. Collisions\nbetween the agents and agents with domain boundaries are prevented by\nimplementing the distance field and correcting the agent's directional vector\nwhen the distance threshold is reached. A unit cube test case is considered to\nevaluate this trajectory planning strategy for volume coverage. For visual\ninspection applications, the algorithm is supplemented with camera direction\ncontrol. A field containing the nearest distance from any point in the domain\nto the structure surface is designed. The gradient of this field is calculated\nto obtain the camera orientation throughout the trajectory. Three different\ntest cases of varying complexities are considered to validate the proposed\nmethod for visual inspection. The simplest scenario is a synthetic portal-like\nstructure inspected using three UAVs. The other two inspection scenarios are\nbased on realistic structures where UAVs are commonly utilized: a wind turbine\nand a bridge. When deployed to a wind turbine inspection, two simulated UAVs\ntraversing smooth spiral trajectories have successfully explored the entire\nturbine structure while cameras are directed to the curved surfaces of the\nturbine's blades. In the bridge test case an efficacious visual inspection of a\ncomplex structure is demonstrated by employing a single UAV and five UAVs. The\nproposed methodology is successful, flexible and applicable in real-world UAV\ninspection tasks.",

    "abstract": "Melanoma is the most malignant skin tumor and usually cancerates from normal\nmoles, which is difficult to distinguish benign from malignant in the early\nstage. Therefore, many machine learning methods are trying to make auxiliary\nprediction. However, these methods attach more attention to the image data of\nsuspected tumor, and focus on improving the accuracy of image classification,\nbut ignore the significance of patient-level contextual information for disease\ndiagnosis in actual clinical diagnosis. To make more use of patient information\nand improve the accuracy of diagnosis, we propose a new melanoma classification\nmodel based on EffNet and Resnet. Our model not only uses images within the\nsame patient but also consider patient-level contextual information for better\ncancer prediction. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed\nmodel achieved 0.981 ACC. Furthermore, we note that the overall ROC value of\nthe model is 0.976 which is better than the previous state-of-the-art\napproaches.",

    "abstract": "Turn-taking, aiming to decide when the next speaker can start talking, is an\nessential component in building human-robot spoken dialogue systems. Previous\nstudies indicate that multimodal cues can facilitate this challenging task.\nHowever, due to the paucity of public multimodal datasets, current methods are\nmostly limited to either utilizing unimodal features or simplistic multimodal\nensemble models. Besides, the inherent class imbalance in real scenario, e.g.\nsentence ending with short pause will be mostly regarded as the end of turn,\nalso poses great challenge to the turn-taking decision. In this paper, we first\ncollect a large-scale annotated corpus for turn-taking with over 5,000 real\nhuman-robot dialogues in speech and text modalities. Then, a novel gated\nmultimodal fusion mechanism is devised to utilize various information\nseamlessly for turn-taking prediction. More importantly, to tackle the data\nimbalance issue, we design a simple yet effective data augmentation method to\nconstruct negative instances without supervision and apply contrastive learning\nto obtain better feature representations.

To aid IVOCT research studies, we developed the Optical\nCoherence TOmography PlaqUe and Stent (OCTOPUS) analysis software. To automate\nimage analysis results, the software includes several important algorithmic\nsteps: pre-processing, deep learning plaque segmentation, machine learning\nidentification of stent struts, and registration of pullbacks. Interactive\nvisualization and manual editing of segmentations were included in the\nsoftware. Quantifications include stent deployment characteristics (e.g., stent\nstrut malapposition), strut level analysis, calcium angle, and calcium\nthickness measurements. Interactive visualizations include (x,y) anatomical, en\nface, and longitudinal views with optional overlays. Underlying plaque\nsegmentation algorithm yielded excellent pixel-wise results (86.2% sensitivity\nand 0.781 F1 score). Using OCTOPUS on 34 new pullbacks, we determined that\nfollowing automated segmentation, only 13% and 23% of frames needed any manual\ntouch up for detailed lumen and calcification labeling, respectively. Only up\nto 3.8% of plaque pixels were modified, leading to an average editing time of\nonly 7.5 seconds/frame, an approximately 80% reduction compared to manual\nanalysis. Regarding stent analysis, sensitivity and precision were both greater\nthan 90%, and each strut was successfully classified as either covered or\nuncovered with high sensitivity (94%) and specificity (90%). We introduced and\nevaluated the clinical application of a highly automated software package,\nOCTOPUS, for quantitative plaque and stent analysis in IVOCT images.

The\ncurrent iteration of the CTS Challenge is a leaderboard-style speaker\nrecognition evaluation using telephony data extracted from the unexposed\nportions of the Call My Net 2 (CMN2) and Multi-Language Speech (MLS) corpora\ncollected by the LDC. The CTS Challenge is currently organized in a similar\nmanner to the SRE19 CTS Challenge, offering only an open training condition\nusing two evaluation subsets, namely Progress and Test. Unlike in the SRE19\nChallenge, no training or development set was initially released, and NIST has\npublicly released the leaderboards on both subsets for the CTS Challenge. Which\nsubset (i.e., Progress or Test) a trial belongs to is unknown to challenge\nparticipants, and each system submission needs to contain outputs for all of\nthe trials. The CTS Challenge has also served, and will continue to do so, as a\nprerequisite for entrance to the regular SREs (such as SRE21). Since August\n2020, a total of 53 organizations (forming 33 teams) from academia and industry\nhave participated in the CTS Challenge and submitted more than 4400 valid\nsystem outputs. This paper presents an overview of the evaluation and several\nanalyses of system performance for some primary conditions in the CTS\nChallenge. The CTS Challenge results thus far indicate remarkable improvements\nin performance due to 1) speaker embeddings extracted using large-scale and\ncomplex neural network architectures such as ResNets along with angular margin\nlosses for speaker embedding extraction, 2) extensive data augmentation, 3) the\nuse of large amounts of in-house proprietary data from a large number of\nlabeled speakers, 4) long-duration fine-tuning.",

    "abstract": "The reconstruction of electrons and photons in CMS depends on topological\nclustering of the energy deposited by an incident particle in different\ncrystals of the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). These clusters are formed\nby aggregating neighbouring crystals according to the expected topology of an\nelectromagnetic shower in the ECAL. The presence of upstream material\n(beampipe, tracker and support structures) causes electrons and photons to\nstart showering before reaching the calorimeter. This effect, combined with the\n3.8T CMS magnetic field, leads to energy being spread in several clusters\naround the primary one. It is essential to recover the energy contained in\nthese satellite clusters in order to achieve the best possible energy\nresolution for physics analyses. Historically satellite clusters have been\nassociated to the primary cluster using a purely topological algorithm which\ndoes not attempt to remove spurious energy deposits from additional pileup\ninteractions (PU). The performance of this algorithm is expected to degrade\nduring LHC Run 3 (2022+) because of the larger average PU levels and the\nincreasing levels of noise due to the ageing of the ECAL detector. New methods\nare being investigated that exploit state-of-the-art deep learning\narchitectures like Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and self-attention algorithms.\nThese more sophisticated models improve the energy collection and are more\nresilient to PU and noise, helping to preserve the electron and photon energy\nresolution achieved during LHC Runs 1 and 2.

We analyze its\nexpected performance and prove concentration properties at any constant level\n(number of layers) on ensembles of random combinatorial optimization problems\nin the infinite size limit. These ensembles include mixed spin models and\nMax-$q$-XORSAT on sparse random hypergraphs. To enable our analysis, we prove a\ngeneralization of the multinomial theorem which is a technical result of\nindependent interest. We then show that the performance of the QAOA at constant\nlevels for the pure $q$-spin model matches asymptotically the ones for\nMax-$q$-XORSAT on random sparse Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi hypergraphs and every\nlarge-girth regular hypergraph. Through this correspondence, we establish that\nthe average-case value produced by the QAOA at constant levels is bounded away\nfrom optimality for pure $q$-spin models when $q\\ge 4$ is even. This limitation\ngives a hardness of approximation result for quantum algorithms in a new regime\nwhere the whole graph is seen.",
