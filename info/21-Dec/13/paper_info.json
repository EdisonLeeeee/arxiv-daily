    "title": "Edge-aware Guidance Fusion Network for RGB Thermal Scene Parsing",
    "abstract": "RGB thermal scene parsing has recently attracted increasing research interest\nin the field of computer vision. However, most existing methods fail to perform\ngood boundary extraction for prediction maps and cannot fully use high level\nfeatures. In addition, these methods simply fuse the features from RGB and\nthermal modalities but are unable to obtain comprehensive fused features. To\naddress these problems, we propose an edge-aware guidance fusion network\n(EGFNet) for RGB thermal scene parsing. First, we introduce a prior edge map\ngenerated using the RGB and thermal images to capture detailed information in\nthe prediction map and then embed the prior edge information in the feature\nmaps. To effectively fuse the RGB and thermal information, we propose a\nmultimodal fusion module that guarantees adequate cross-modal fusion.\nConsidering the importance of high level semantic information, we propose a\nglobal information module and a semantic information module to extract rich\nsemantic information from the high-level features. For decoding, we use simple\nelementwise addition for cascaded feature fusion. Finally, to improve the\nparsing accuracy, we apply multitask deep supervision to the semantic and\nboundary maps. Extensive experiments were performed on benchmark datasets to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EGFNet and its superior\nperformance compared with state of the art methods.

    "abstract": "Acoustic classification of frogs has gotten a lot of attention recently due\nto its potential applicability in ecological investigations. Numerous studies\nhave been presented for identifying frog species, although the majority of\nrecorded species are thought to be monotypic. The purpose of this study is to\ndemonstrate a method for classifying various frog species using an audio\nrecording. To be more exact, continuous frog recordings are cut into audio\nsnippets first (10 seconds). Then, for each ten-second recording, several\ntime-frequency representations are constructed. Following that, rather than\nusing manually created features, Machine Learning methods are employed to\nclassify the frog species. Data reduction techniques; Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) are used to extract the\nmost important features before classification. Finally, to validate our\nclassification accuracy, cross validation and prediction accuracy are used.\nExperimental results show that PCA extracted features that achieved better\nclassification accuracy both with cross validation and prediction accuracy.",

While being very effective on\nlearning holistic image and video representations, such an approach becomes\nsub-optimal for learning spatio-temporally fine-grained features in videos,\nwhere scenes and instances evolve through space and time. In this paper, we\npresent the Contextualized Spatio-Temporal Contrastive Learning (ConST-CL)\nframework to effectively learn spatio-temporally fine-grained representations\nusing self-supervision. We first design a region-based self-supervised pretext\ntask which requires the model to learn to transform instance representations\nfrom one view to another guided by context features. Further, we introduce a\nsimple network design that effectively reconciles the simultaneous learning\nprocess of both holistic and local representations. We evaluate our learned\nrepresentations on a variety of downstream tasks and ConST-CL achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on four datasets. For spatio-temporal action\nlocalization, ConST-CL achieves 39.4% mAP with ground-truth boxes and 30.5% mAP\nwith detected boxes on the AVA-Kinetics validation set. For object tracking,\nConST-CL achieves 78.1% precision and 55.2% success scores on OTB2015.\nFurthermore, ConST-CL achieves 94.8% and 71.9% top-1 fine-tuning accuracy on\nvideo action recognition datasets, UCF101 and HMDB51 respectively.

    "abstract": "When selecting multiple candidates based on approval preferences of agents,\nthe proportional representation of agents' opinions is an important and\nwell-studied desideratum. Existing criteria for evaluating the\nrepresentativeness of outcomes focus on groups of agents and demand that\nsufficiently large and cohesive groups are ''represented'' in the sense that\ncandidates approved by some group members are selected. Crucially, these\ncriteria say nothing about the representation of individual agents, even if\nthese agents are members of groups that deserve representation. In this paper,\nwe formalize the concept of individual representation (IR) and explore to which\nextent, and under which circumstances, it can be achieved. We show that\nchecking whether an IR outcome exists is computationally intractable, and we\nverify that all common approval-based voting rules may fail to provide IR even\nin cases where this is possible. We then focus on domain restrictions and\nestablish an interesting contrast between ''voter interval'' and ''candidate\ninterval'' preferences.

    "abstract": "With the wide application of electronic health records (EHR) in healthcare\nfacilities, health event prediction with deep learning has gained more and more\nattention. A common feature of EHR data used for deep-learning-based\npredictions is historical diagnoses. Existing work mainly regards a diagnosis\nas an independent disease and does not consider clinical relations among\ndiseases in a visit. Many machine learning approaches assume disease\nrepresentations are static in different visits of a patient. However, in real\npractice, multiple diseases that are frequently diagnosed at the same time\nreflect hidden patterns that are conducive to prognosis. Moreover, the\ndevelopment of a disease is not static since some diseases can emerge or\ndisappear and show various symptoms in different visits of a patient. To\neffectively utilize this combinational disease information and explore the\ndynamics of diseases, we propose a novel context-aware learning framework using\ntransition functions on dynamic disease graphs. Specifically, we construct a\nglobal disease co-occurrence graph with multiple node properties for disease\ncombinations. We design dynamic subgraphs for each patient's visit to leverage\nglobal and local contexts. We further define three diagnosis roles in each\nvisit based on the variation of node properties to model disease transition\nprocesses. Experimental results on two real-world EHR datasets show that the\nproposed model outperforms state of the art in predicting health events.",

We develop a new two-part framework for training\nconversational recommender systems. First, we train a recommender system to\njointly suggest items and justify its reasoning with subjective aspects.

    "title": "Spinning Language Models for Propaganda-As-A-Service",
    "abstract": "We investigate a new threat to neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models:\ntraining-time attacks that cause models to \"spin\" their outputs so as to\nsupport an adversary-chosen sentiment or point of view, but only when the input\ncontains adversary-chosen trigger words. For example, a spinned summarization\nmodel would output positive summaries of any text that mentions the name of\nsome individual or organization.\nModel spinning enables propaganda-as-a-service. An adversary can create\ncustomized language models that produce desired spins for chosen triggers, then\ndeploy them to generate disinformation (a platform attack), or else inject them\ninto ML training pipelines (a supply-chain attack), transferring malicious\nfunctionality to downstream models.\nIn technical terms, model spinning introduces a \"meta-backdoor\" into a model.\nWhereas conventional backdoors cause models to produce incorrect outputs on\ninputs with the trigger, outputs of spinned models preserve context and\nmaintain standard accuracy metrics, yet also satisfy a meta-task chosen by the\nadversary (e.g., positive sentiment).\nTo demonstrate feasibility of model spinning, we develop a new backdooring\ntechnique. It stacks the adversarial meta-task onto a seq2seq model,\nbackpropagates the desired meta-task output to points in the word-embedding\nspace we call \"pseudo-words,\" and uses pseudo-words to shift the entire output\ndistribution of the seq2seq model. We evaluate this attack on language\ngeneration, summarization, and translation models with different triggers and\nmeta-tasks such as sentiment, toxicity, and entailment. Spinned models maintain\ntheir accuracy metrics while satisfying the adversary's meta-task. In supply\nchain attack the spin transfers to downstream models.\nFinally, we propose a black-box, meta-task-independent defense to detect\nmodels that selectively apply spin to inputs with a certain trigger.",

    "abstract": "Developing suitable approximate models for analyzing and simulating complex\nnonlinear systems is practically important. This paper aims at exploring the\nskill of a rich class of nonlinear stochastic models, known as the conditional\nGaussian nonlinear system (CGNS), as both a cheap surrogate model and a fast\npreconditioner for facilitating many computationally challenging tasks. The\nCGNS preserves the underlying physics to a large extent and can reproduce\nintermittency, extreme events and other non-Gaussian features in many complex\nsystems arising from practical applications. Three interrelated topics are\nstudied. First, the closed analytic formulae of solving the conditional\nstatistics provide an efficient and accurate data assimilation scheme. It is\nshown that the data assimilation skill of a suitable CGNS approximate forecast\nmodel outweighs that by applying an ensemble method even to the perfect model\nwith strong nonlinearity, where the latter suffers from filter divergence.\nSecond, the CGNS allows the development of a fast algorithm for simultaneously\nestimating the parameters and the unobserved variables with uncertainty\nquantification in the presence of only partial observations. Utilizing an\nappropriate CGNS as a preconditioner significantly reduces the computational\ncost in accurately estimating the parameters in the original complex system.\nFinally, the CGNS advances rapid and statistically accurate algorithms for\ncomputing the probability density function and sampling the trajectories of the\nunobserved state variables. These fast algorithms facilitate the development of\nan efficient and accurate data-driven method for predicting the linear response\nof the original system with respect to parameter perturbations based on a\nsuitable CGNS preconditioner.",

    "abstract": "Tremendous progress has been made in recent years in developing better image\ncaptioning models, yet most of them rely on a separate object detector to\nextract regional features. Recent vision-language studies are shifting towards\nthe detector-free trend by leveraging grid representations for more flexible\nmodel training and faster inference speed. However, such development is\nprimarily focused on image understanding tasks, and remains less investigated\nfor the caption generation task. In this paper, we are concerned with a\nbetter-performing detector-free image captioning model, and propose a pure\nvision transformer-based image captioning model, dubbed as ViTCAP, in which\ngrid representations are used without extracting the regional features. For\nimproved performance, we introduce a novel Concept Token Network (CTN) to\npredict the semantic concepts and then incorporate them into the end-to-end\ncaptioning. In particular, the CTN is built on the basis of a vision\ntransformer and is designed to predict the concept tokens through a\nclassification task, from which the rich semantic information contained greatly\nbenefits the captioning task. Compared with the previous detector-based models,\nViTCAP drastically simplifies the architectures and at the same time achieves\ncompetitive performance on various challenging image captioning datasets. In\nparticular, ViTCAP reaches 138.1 CIDEr scores on COCO-caption Karpathy-split,\n93.8 and 108.6 CIDEr scores on nocaps, and Google-CC captioning datasets,\nrespectively.",

For example, in the problem of plasma control\nfor nuclear fusion, computing the next state for a given state-action pair\nrequires querying an expensive transition function which can lead to many hours\nof computer simulation or dollars of scientific research. Such expensive data\ncollection prohibits application of standard RL algorithms which usually\nrequire a large number of observations to learn. In this work, we address the\nproblem of efficiently learning a policy while making a minimal number of\nstate-action queries to the transition function. In particular, we leverage\nideas from Bayesian optimal experimental design to guide the selection of\nstate-action queries for efficient learning. We propose an acquisition function\nthat quantifies how much information a state-action pair would provide about\nthe optimal solution to a Markov decision process. At each iteration, our\nalgorithm maximizes this acquisition function, to choose the most informative\nstate-action pair to be queried, thus yielding a data-efficient RL approach. We\nexperiment with a variety of simulated continuous control problems and show\nthat our approach learns an optimal policy with up to $5$ -- $1,000\\times$ less\ndata than model-based RL baselines and $10^3$ -- $10^5\\times$ less data than\nmodel-free RL baselines.

    "abstract": "This report discusses the results of SBIR Phase I effort to prove the\nfeasibility of dramatic improvement of the microbolometer-based Long Wave\nInfrared (LWIR) detectors sensitivity, especially for the 3D measurements. The\nresulting low SWaP-C thermal depth-sensing system will enable the situational\nawareness of Autonomous Air Vehicles for Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). It will\nprovide robust 3D information of the surrounding environment, including\nlow-contrast static and moving objects, at far distances in degraded visual\nconditions and GPS-denied areas. Our multi-sensor 3D perception enabled by COTS\nuncooled thermal sensors mitigates major weakness of LWIR sensors - low\ncontrast by increasing the system sensitivity over an order of magnitude.\nThere were no available thermal image sets suitable for evaluating this\ntechnology, making datasets acquisition our first goal. We discuss the design\nand construction of the prototype system with sixteen 640pix x 512pix LWIR\ndetectors, camera calibration to subpixel resolution, capture, and process\nsynchronized image. The results show the 3.84x contrast increase for\nintrascene-only data and an additional 5.5x - with the interscene accumulation,\nreaching system noise-equivalent temperature difference (NETD) of 1.9 mK with\nthe 40 mK sensors.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are critically susceptible to evasion attacks from\nadversarial examples. Generally, adversarial examples, modified inputs\ndeceptively similar to the original input, are constructed under whitebox\nsettings by adversaries with full access to the model. However, recent attacks\nhave shown a remarkable reduction in query numbers to craft adversarial\nexamples using blackbox attacks. Particularly, alarming is the ability to\nexploit the classification decision from the access interface of a trained\nmodel provided by a growing number of Machine Learning as a Service providers\nincluding Google, Microsoft, IBM and used by a plethora of applications\nincorporating these models. The ability of an adversary to exploit only the\npredicted label from a model to craft adversarial examples is distinguished as\na decision-based attack. In our study, we first deep dive into recent\nstate-of-the-art decision-based attacks in ICLR and SP to highlight the costly\nnature of discovering low distortion adversarial employing gradient estimation\nmethods. We develop a robust query efficient attack capable of avoiding\nentrapment in a local minimum and misdirection from noisy gradients seen in\ngradient estimation methods. The attack method we propose, RamBoAttack,\nexploits the notion of Randomized Block Coordinate Descent to explore the\nhidden classifier manifold, targeting perturbations to manipulate only\nlocalized input features to address the issues of gradient estimation methods.\nImportantly, the RamBoAttack is more robust to the different sample inputs\navailable to an adversary and the targeted class. Overall, for a given target\nclass, RamBoAttack is demonstrated to be more robust at achieving a lower\ndistortion within a given query budget. We curate our extensive results using\nthe large-scale high-resolution ImageNet dataset and open-source our attack,\ntest samples and artifacts on GitHub.",

    "abstract": "To enhance the coverage and transmission reliability, repetitions adopted by\nNarrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) allow repeating transmissions several\ntimes. However, this results in a waste of radio resources when the signal\nstrength is high. In addition, in low signal quality, the selection of a higher\nmodulation and coding scheme (MCS) level leads to a huge packet loss in the\nnetwork. Moreover, the number of physical resource blocks (PRBs) per-user needs\nto be chosen dynamically, such that the utilization of radio resources can be\nimproved on per-user basis. Therefore, in NB-IoT systems, dynamic adaptation of\nrepetitions, MCS, and radio resources, known as auto link-configuration, is\ncrucial. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose SmartCon which is a Generative\nAdversarial Network (GAN)-based deep learning approach for auto\nlink-configuration during uplink or downlink scheduling, such that the packet\nloss rate is significantly reduced in NB-IoT networks. For the training purpose\nof the GAN, we use a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based reinforcement learning\nmechanism that intelligently tunes its output depending on the present network\ncondition. The performance of SmartCon is thoroughly evaluated through\nsimulations where it is shown to significantly improve the performance of\nNB-IoT systems compared to baseline schemes.",

Recently, automated EV charging\nsystems have received huge attention to improve users' experience and to\nefficiently utilize charging infrastructures and parking lots. However, most\nrelated works have focused on system design, robot control, planning, and\nmanipulation. Towards robust EV charging inlet detection, we propose a new\ndataset (EVCI dataset) and a novel data augmentation method that is based on\nimage-to-image translation where typical image-to-image translation methods\nsynthesize a new image in a different domain given an image. To the best of our\nknowledge, the EVCI dataset is the first EV charging inlet dataset. For the\ndata augmentation method, we focus on being able to control synthesized images'\ncaptured environments (e.g., time, lighting) in an intuitive way. To achieve\nthis, we first propose the environment guide vector that humans can intuitively\ninterpret. We then propose a novel image-to-image translation network that\ntranslates a given image towards the environment described by the vector.\nAccordingly, it aims to synthesize a new image that has the same content as the\ngiven image while looking like captured in the provided environment by the\nenvironment guide vector. Lastly, we train a detection method using the\naugmented dataset. Through experiments on the EVCI dataset, we demonstrate that\nthe proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

While\nmost works focus on single-object or agent-object visual functionality and\naffordances, our work proposes to study a new kind of visual relationship that\nis also important to perceive and model -- inter-object functional\nrelationships (e.g., a switch on the wall turns on or off the light, a remote\ncontrol operates the TV). Humans often spend little or no effort to infer these\nrelationships, even when entering a new room, by using our strong prior\nknowledge (e.g., we know that buttons control electrical devices) or using only\na few exploratory interactions in cases of uncertainty (e.g., multiple switches\nand lights in the same room). In this paper, we take the first step in building\nAI system learning inter-object functional relationships in 3D indoor\nenvironments with key technical contributions of modeling prior knowledge by\ntraining over large-scale scenes and designing interactive policies for\neffectively exploring the training scenes and quickly adapting to novel test\nscenes.

    "abstract": "Differentiable rendering is an essential operation in modern vision, allowing\ninverse graphics approaches to 3D understanding to be utilized in modern\nmachine learning frameworks. Explicit shape representations (voxels, point\nclouds, or meshes), while relatively easily rendered, often suffer from limited\ngeometric fidelity or topological constraints. On the other hand, implicit\nrepresentations (occupancy, distance, or radiance fields) preserve greater\nfidelity, but suffer from complex or inefficient rendering processes, limiting\nscalability. In this work, we endeavour to address both shortcomings with a\nnovel shape representation that allows fast differentiable rendering within an\nimplicit architecture. Building on implicit distance representations, we define\nDirected Distance Fields (DDFs), which map an oriented point (position and\ndirection) to surface visibility and depth. Such a field can render a depth map\nwith a single forward pass per pixel, enable differential surface geometry\nextraction (e.g., surface normals and curvatures) via network derivatives, be\neasily composed, and permit extraction of classical unsigned distance fields.\nUsing probabilistic DDFs (PDDFs), we show how to model inherent discontinuities\nin the underlying field.

Due to the fact that it is difficult to manually annotate a\nqualitative large-scale 3D point cloud dataset, unsupervised domain adaptation\n(UDA) is popular in 3D point cloud learning which aims to transfer the learned\nknowledge from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain.\nHowever, the generalization and reconstruction errors caused by domain shift\nwith simply-learned model are inevitable which substantially hinder the model's\ncapability from learning good representations.

Generally, our SEN resorts to the advantages of Mean Teacher\nand semi-supervised learning, and introduces a soft classification loss and a\nconsistency loss, aiming to achieve consistent generalization and accurate\nreconstruction. In SEN, a student network is kept in a collaborative manner\nwith supervised learning and self-supervised learning, and a teacher network\nconducts temporal consistency to learn useful representations and ensure the\nquality of point clouds reconstruction.

Implementation of\ndifferentially private (DP) mechanisms has to be done carefully to ensure\nend-to-end security guarantees. In this paper we study two implementation flaws\nin the noise generation commonly used in DP systems. First we examine the\nGaussian mechanism's susceptibility to a floating-point representation attack.\nThe premise of this first vulnerability is similar to the one carried out by\nMironov in 2011 against the Laplace mechanism. Our experiments show attack's\nsuccess against DP algorithms, including deep learners trained using\ndifferentially-private stochastic gradient descent.\nIn the second part of the paper we study discrete counterparts of the Laplace\nand Gaussian mechanisms that were previously proposed to alleviate the\nshortcomings of floating-point representation of real numbers. We show that\nsuch implementations unfortunately suffer from another side channel: a novel\ntiming attack. An observer that can measure the time to draw (discrete) Laplace\nor Gaussian noise can predict the noise magnitude, which can then be used to\nrecover sensitive attributes. This attack invalidates differential privacy\nguarantees of systems implementing such mechanisms.\nWe demonstrate that several commonly used, state-of-the-art implementations\nof differential privacy are susceptible to these attacks.

    "abstract": "Intervention policies against COVID-19 have caused large-scale disruptions\nglobally, and led to a series of pattern changes in the power system operation.\nAnalyzing these pandemic-induced patterns is imperative to identify the\npotential risks and impacts of this extreme event. With this purpose, we\ndeveloped an open-access data hub (COVID-EMDA+), an open-source toolbox\n(CoVEMDA), and a few evaluation methods to explore what the U.S. power systems\nare experiencing during COVID-19. These resources could be broadly used for\nresearch, policy making, or educational purposes. Technically, our data hub\nharmonizes a variety of raw data such as generation mix, demand profiles,\nelectricity price, weather observations, mobility, confirmed cases and deaths.\nSeveral support methods and metrics are then implemented in our toolbox,\nincluding baseline estimation, regression analysis, and scientific\nvisualization. Based on these, we conduct three empirical studies on the U.S.\npower systems and markets to introduce some new solutions and unexpected\nfindings. This conveys a more complete picture of the pandemic's impacts, and\nalso opens up several attractive topics for future work. Python, Matlab source\ncodes, and user manuals are all publicly shared on a Github repository.",

    "abstract": "Federated machine learning is a versatile and flexible tool to utilize\ndistributed data from different sources, especially when communication\ntechnology develops rapidly and an unprecedented amount of data could be\ncollected on mobile devices nowadays. Federated learning method exploits not\nonly the data but the computational power of all devices in the network to\nachieve more efficient model training. Nevertheless, while most traditional\nfederated learning methods work well for homogeneous data and tasks, adapting\nthe method to a different heterogeneous data and task distribution is\nchallenging. This limitation has constrained the applications of federated\nlearning in real-world contexts, especially in healthcare settings. Inspired by\nthe fundamental idea of meta-learning, in this study we propose a new\nalgorithm, which is an integration of federated learning and meta-learning, to\ntackle this issue. In addition, owing to the advantage of transfer learning for\nmodel generalization, we further improve our algorithm by introducing partial\nparameter sharing. We name this method partial meta-federated learning (PMFL).\nFinally, we apply the algorithms to two medical datasets. We show that our\nalgorithm could obtain the fastest training speed and achieve the best\nperformance when dealing with heterogeneous medical datasets.",

Early diagnosis of melanoma can\nsignificantly reduce mortality rates and treatment costs. Therefore, skin\ncancer specialists are using image-based diagnostic tools for detecting\nmelanoma earlier. We aim to develop a handheld device featured with low cost\nand high performance to enhance early detection of melanoma at the primary\nhealthcare.

    "abstract": "In point cloud generation and completion, previous methods for transforming\nlatent features to point clouds are generally based on fully connected layers\n(FC-based) or folding operations (Folding-based). However, point clouds\ngenerated by FC-based methods are usually troubled by outliers and rough\nsurfaces. For folding-based methods, their data flow is large, convergence\nspeed is slow, and they are also hard to handle the generation of non-smooth\nsurfaces. In this work, we propose AXform, an attention-based method to\ntransform latent features to point clouds. AXform first generates points in an\ninterim space, using a fully connected layer. These interim points are then\naggregated to generate the target point cloud. AXform takes both parameter\nsharing and data flow into account, which makes it has fewer outliers, fewer\nnetwork parameters, and a faster convergence speed. The points generated by\nAXform do not have the strong 2-manifold constraint, which improves the\ngeneration of non-smooth surfaces. When AXform is expanded to multiple branches\nfor local generations, the centripetal constraint makes it has properties of\nself-clustering and space consistency, which further enables unsupervised\nsemantic segmentation. We also adopt this scheme and design AXformNet for point\ncloud completion. Considerable experiments on different datasets show that our\nmethods achieve state-of-the-art results.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in deep-learning based semantic segmentation,\nautomatic building detection from remotely sensed imagery is still a\nchallenging problem owing to large variability in the appearance of buildings\nacross the globe. The errors occur mostly around the boundaries of the building\nfootprints, in shadow areas, and when detecting buildings whose exterior\nsurfaces have reflectivity properties that are very similar to those of the\nsurrounding regions. To overcome these problems, we propose a generative\nadversarial network based segmentation framework with uncertainty attention\nunit and refinement module embedded in the generator. The refinement module,\ncomposed of edge and reverse attention units, is designed to refine the\npredicted building map. The edge attention enhances the boundary features to\nestimate building boundaries with greater precision, and the reverse attention\nallows the network to explore the features missing in the previously estimated\nregions. The uncertainty attention unit assists the network in resolving\nuncertainties in classification. As a measure of the power of our approach, as\nof December 4, 2021, it ranks at the second place on DeepGlobe's public\nleaderboard despite the fact that main focus of our approach -- refinement of\nthe building edges -- does not align exactly with the metrics used for\nleaderboard rankings.

We\ndemonstrate two cases where it is not. First, under sufficiently small\npretraining budgets, supervised pretraining on ImageNet consistently\noutperforms a comparable contrastive model on eight diverse image\nclassification datasets. This suggests that the common practice of comparing\npretraining approaches at hundreds or thousands of epochs may not produce\nactionable insights for those with more limited compute budgets. Second, even\nwith larger pretraining budgets we identify tasks where supervised learning\nprevails, perhaps because the object-centric bias of supervised pretraining\nmakes the model more resilient to common corruptions and spurious\nforeground-background correlations.

However,\nsince a classification loss is insufficient for providing precise object\nregions, CAMs tend to be biased towards discriminative patterns (i.e.,\nsparseness) and do not provide precise object boundary information (i.e.,\nimpreciseness). To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel framework\n(composed of MainNet and SupportNet.) that derives pixel-level self-supervision\nfrom given image-level supervision. In our framework, with the help of the\nproposed Regional Contrastive Module (RCM) and Multi-scale Attentive Module\n(MAM), MainNet is trained by self-supervision from the SupportNet.

Then, every pixel-wise feature of\nthe MainNet is trained by the prototype in a contrastive manner, sharpening the\nresulting CAMs. The MAM utilizes CAMs inferred at multiple scales from the\nSupportNet as self-supervision to guide the MainNet.

By exploiting the structure, can\nwe achieve better compression rates than state-of-the-art graph summarization\nmethods?\nThe explosive proliferation of the Web has accelerated the emergence of large\ngraphs, such as online social networks and hyperlink networks. Consequently,\ngraph compression has become increasingly important to process such large\ngraphs without expensive I/O over the network or to disk. Among a number of\napproaches, graph summarization, which in essence combines similar nodes into a\nsupernode and describe their connectivity concisely, protrudes with several\nadvantages. However, we note that it fails to exploit pervasive hierarchical\nstructures of real-world graphs as its underlying representation model enforces\nsupernodes to be disjoint.\nIn this work, we propose the hierarchical graph summarization model, which is\nan expressive graph representation model that includes the previous one\nproposed by Navlakha et al. as a special case. The new model represents an\nunweighted graph using positive and negative edges between hierarchical\nsupernodes, each of which can contain others. Then, we propose Slugger, a\nscalable heuristic for concisely and exactly representing a given graph under\nour new model. Slugger greedily merges nodes into supernodes while maintaining\nand exploiting their hierarchy, which is later pruned. Slugger significantly\naccelerates this process by sampling, approximation, and memoization.

Since each verb is associated with a specific\nset of semantic roles, all existing GSR methods resort to a two-stage\nframework: predicting the verb in the first stage and detecting the semantic\nroles in the second stage. However, there are obvious drawbacks in both stages:\n1) The widely-used cross-entropy (XE) loss for object recognition is\ninsufficient in verb classification due to the large intra-class variation and\nhigh inter-class similarity among daily activities. 2) All semantic roles are\ndetected in an autoregressive manner, which fails to model the complex semantic\nrelations between different roles. To this end, we propose a novel SituFormer\nfor GSR which consists of a Coarse-to-Fine Verb Model (CFVM) and a\nTransformer-based Noun Model (TNM). CFVM is a two-step verb prediction model: a\ncoarse-grained model trained with XE loss first proposes a set of verb\ncandidates, and then a fine-grained model trained with triplet loss re-ranks\nthese candidates with enhanced verb features (not only separable but also\ndiscriminative). TNM is a transformer-based semantic role detection model,\nwhich detects all roles parallelly. Owing to the global relation modeling\nability and flexibility of the transformer decoder, TNM can fully explore the\nstatistical dependency of the roles. Extensive validations on the challenging\nSWiG benchmark show that SituFormer achieves a new state-of-the-art performance\nwith significant gains under various metrics.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that adversarial examples hand-crafted on one\nwhite-box model can be used to attack other black-box models. Such cross-model\ntransferability makes it feasible to perform black-box attacks, which has\nraised security concerns for real-world DNNs applications. Nevertheless,\nexisting works mostly focus on investigating the adversarial transferability\nacross different deep models that share the same modality of input data. The\ncross-modal transferability of adversarial perturbation has never been\nexplored. This paper investigates the transferability of adversarial\nperturbation across different modalities, i.e., leveraging adversarial\nperturbation generated on white-box image models to attack black-box video\nmodels. Specifically, motivated by the observation that the low-level feature\nspace between images and video frames are similar, we propose a simple yet\neffective cross-modal attack method, named as Image To Video (I2V) attack. I2V\ngenerates adversarial frames by minimizing the cosine similarity between\nfeatures of pre-trained image models from adversarial and benign examples, then\ncombines the generated adversarial frames to perform black-box attacks on video\nrecognition models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that I2V can achieve high\nattack success rates on different black-box video recognition models. On\nKinetics-400 and UCF-101, I2V achieves an average attack success rate of 77.88%\nand 65.68%, respectively, which sheds light on the feasibility of cross-modal\nadversarial attacks.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a Monte Carlo algorithm named the Frozen Gaussian\nSampling (FGS) to solve the semiclassical Schr\\\"odinger equation based on the\nfrozen Gaussian approximation. Due to the highly oscillatory structure of the\nwave function, traditional mesh-based algorithms suffer from \"the curse of\ndimensionality\", which gives rise to more severe computational burden when the\nsemiclassical parameter \\(\\ep\\) is small. The Frozen Gaussian sampling\noutperforms the existing algorithms in that it is mesh-free in computing the\nphysical observables and is suitable for high dimensional problems. In this\nwork, we provide detailed procedures to implement the FGS for both Gaussian and\nWKB initial data cases, where the sampling strategies on the phase space\nbalance the need of variance reduction and sampling convenience. Moreover, we\nrigorously prove that, to reach a certain accuracy, the number of samples\nneeded for the FGS is independent of the scaling parameter \\(\\ep\\).\nFurthermore, the complexity of the FGS algorithm is of a sublinear scaling with\nrespect to the microscopic degrees of freedom and, in particular, is\ninsensitive to the dimension number. The performance of the FGS is validated\nthrough several typical numerical experiments, including simulating scattering\nby the barrier potential, formation of the caustics and computing the\nhigh-dimensional physical observables without mesh.",

    "abstract": "In collaborative learning settings like federated learning, curious parities\nmight be honest but are attempting to infer other parties' private data through\ninference attacks while malicious parties might manipulate the learning process\nfor their own purposes through backdoor attacks. However, most existing works\nonly consider the federated learning scenario where data are partitioned by\nsamples (HFL). The feature-partitioned federated learning (VFL) can be another\nimportant scenario in many real-world applications. Attacks and defenses in\nsuch scenarios are especially challenging when the attackers and the defenders\nare not able to access the features or model parameters of other participants.\nPrevious works have only shown that private labels can be reconstructed from\nper-sample gradients. In this paper, we first show that private labels can be\nreconstructed when only batch-averaged gradients are revealed, which is against\nthe common presumption. In addition, we show that a passive party in VFL can\neven replace its corresponding labels in the active party with a target label\nthrough a gradient-replacement attack. To defend against the first attack, we\nintroduce a novel technique termed confusional autoencoder (CoAE), based on\nautoencoder and entropy regularization. We demonstrate that label inference\nattacks can be successfully blocked by this technique while hurting less main\ntask accuracy compared to existing methods. Our CoAE technique is also\neffective in defending the gradient-replacement backdoor attack, making it an\nuniversal and practical defense strategy with no change to the original VFL\nprotocol. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches under both\ntwo-party and multi-party VFL settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first systematic study to deal with label inference and backdoor attacks in\nthe feature-partitioned federated learning framework.",

The GP algorithm approximates the solution of a MFG with maximum a\nposteriori probability estimators of GPs conditioned on the partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) system of the MFG at a finite number of sample\npoints. The main bottleneck of the GP method is to compute the inverse of a\nsquare gram matrix, whose size is proportional to the number of sample points.\nTo improve the performance, we introduce the FF method, whose insight comes\nfrom the recent trend of approximating positive definite kernels with random\nFourier features. The FF algorithm seeks approximated solutions in the space\ngenerated by sampled Fourier features. In the FF method, the size of the matrix\nto be inverted depends only on the number of Fourier features selected, which\nis much less than the size of sample points. Hence, the FF method reduces the\nprecomputation time, saves the memory, and achieves comparable accuracy to the\nGP method. We give the existence and the convergence proofs for both\nalgorithms. The convergence argument of the GP method does not depend on the\nLasry-Lions monotonicity condition, which suggests the potential applications\nof the GP method to solve MFGs with non-monotone couplings in future work.

Let $G$ be an arbitrary given graph, $p \\in (0, 1]$ a parameter of the\nproblem, and let $G_p$ be a random subgraph that includes each edge of $G$\nindependently with probability $p$. We are unaware of the realization $G_p$,\nbut can learn if an edge $e$ exists in $G_p$ by querying it. The goal is to\nfind an approximate minimum vertex cover (MVC) of $G_p$ by querying few edges\nof $G$ non-adaptively.\nThis stochastic setting has been studied extensively for various problems\nsuch as minimum spanning trees, matroids, shortest paths, and matchings. To our\nknowledge, however, no non-trivial bound was known for MVC prior to our work.\nIn this work, we present a:\n* $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation for general graphs which queries\n$O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^3 p})$ edges per vertex, and a\n* $1.367$-approximation for bipartite graphs which queries $poly(1/p)$ edges\nper vertex.\nAdditionally, we show that at the expense of a triple-exponential dependence\non $p^{-1}$ in the number of queries, the approximation ratio can be improved\ndown to $(1+\\epsilon)$ for bipartite graphs.\nOur techniques also lead to improved bounds for bipartite stochastic\nmatching. We obtain a $0.731$-approximation with nearly-linear in $1/p$\nper-vertex queries.

As a\nremedy, recent work proposed to predict edge probabilities with awareness to\npotential conflicts by incorporating cycle constraints in the prediction\nprocess.

    "abstract": "With the emerging technologies in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS),\nthe adaptive operation of road space is likely to be realised within decades.\nAn intelligent street can learn and improve its decision-making on the\nright-of-way (ROW) for road users, liberating more active pedestrian space\nwhile maintaining traffic safety and efficiency. However, there is a lack of\neffective controlling techniques for these adaptive street infrastructures. To\nfill this gap in existing studies, we formulate this control problem as a\nMarkov Game and develop a solution based on the multi-agent Deep Deterministic\nPolicy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. The proposed model can dynamically assign\nROW for sidewalks, autonomous vehicles (AVs) driving lanes and on-street\nparking areas in real-time. Integrated with the SUMO traffic simulator, this\nmodel was evaluated using the road network of the South Kensington District\nagainst three cases of divergent traffic conditions: pedestrian flow rates, AVs\ntraffic flow rates and parking demands. Results reveal that our model can\nachieve an average reduction of 3.87% and 6.26% in street space assigned for\non-street parking and vehicular operations. Combined with space gained by\nlimiting the number of driving lanes, the average proportion of sidewalks to\ntotal widths of streets can significantly increase by 10.13%.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks have shown state-of-the-art performance in designing\nauctions, where the network learns the optimal allocations and payment rule to\nensure desirable properties. Motivated by the same, we focus on learning fair\ndivision of resources, with no payments involved. Our goal is to allocate the\nitems, goods and/or chores efficiently among the fair allocations. By fair, we\nmean an allocation that is Envy-free (EF). However, such an allocation may not\nalways exist for indivisible resources. Therefore, we consider the relaxed\nnotion, Envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) that is guaranteed to exist.\nHowever, it is not enough to guarantee EF1 since the allocation of empty\nbundles is also EF1. Hence, we add the further constraint of efficiency,\nmaximum utilitarian social welfare (USW). In general finding, USW allocations\namong EF1 is an NP-Hard problem even when valuations are additive. In this\nwork, we design a network for this task which we refer to as EEF1-NN. We\npropose an UNet inspired architecture, Lagrangian loss function, and training\nprocedure to obtain desired results. We show that EEF1-NN finds allocation\nclose to optimal USW allocation and ensures EF1 with a high probability for\ndifferent distributions over input valuations. Compared to existing approaches\nEEF1-NN empirically guarantees higher USW. Moreover, EEF1-NN is scalable and\ndetermines the allocations much faster than solving it as a constrained\noptimization problem.",

Previous statistical-query lower bounds [DKS17] give\nformal evidence that even distinguishing such mixtures from (pure) Gaussians\nmay be exponentially hard (in $k$).\nWe show that this kind of hardness can only appear if mixing weights are\nallowed to be exponentially small, and that for polynomially lower bounded\nmixing weights non-trivial algorithmic guarantees are possible in\nquasi-polynomial time.\nConcretely, we develop an algorithm based on the sum-of-squares method with\nrunning time quasi-polynomial in the minimum mixing weight. The algorithm can\nreliably distinguish between a mixture of $k\\ge 2$ well-separated Gaussian\ncomponents and a (pure) Gaussian distribution. As a certificate, the algorithm\ncomputes a bipartition of the input sample that separates a pair of mixture\ncomponents, i.e., both sides of the bipartition contain most of the sample\npoints of at least one component.\nFor the special case of colinear means, our algorithm outputs a $k$\nclustering of the input sample that is approximately consistent with the\ncomponents of the mixture.\nA significant challenge for our results is that they appear to be inherently\nsensitive to small fractions of adversarial outliers unlike most previous\nresults for Gaussian mixtures. The reason is that such outliers can simulate\nexponentially small mixing weights even for mixtures with polynomially lower\nbounded mixing weights.\nA key technical ingredient is a characterization of separating directions for\nwell-separated Gaussian components in terms of ratios of polynomials that\ncorrespond to moments of two carefully chosen orders logarithmic in the minimum\nmixing weight.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles and robots require increasingly more robustness and\nreliability to meet the demands of modern tasks. These requirements specially\napply to cameras because they are the predominant sensors to acquire\ninformation about the environment and support actions. A camera must maintain\nproper functionality and take automatic countermeasures if necessary. However,\nthere is little work that examines the practical use of a general condition\nmonitoring approach for cameras and designs countermeasures in the context of\nan envisaged high-level application. We propose a generic and interpretable\nself-health-maintenance framework for cameras based on data- and\nphysically-grounded models. To this end, we determine two reliable, real-time\ncapable estimators for typical image effects of a camera in poor condition\n(defocus blur, motion blur, different noise phenomena and most common\ncombinations) by comparing traditional and retrained machine learning-based\napproaches in extensive experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate how one can\nadjust the camera parameters (e.g., exposure time and ISO gain) to achieve\noptimal whole-system capability based on experimental (non-linear and\nnon-monotonic) input-output performance curves, using object detection, motion\nblur and sensor noise as examples. Our framework not only provides a practical\nready-to-use solution to evaluate and maintain the health of cameras, but can\nalso serve as a basis for extensions to tackle more sophisticated problems that\ncombine additional data sources (e.g., sensor or environment parameters)\nempirically in order to attain fully reliable and robust machines.",

    "abstract": "Embedded Systems (ES) development has been historically focused on\nfunctionality rather than security, and today it still applies in many sectors\nand applications. However, there is an increasing number of security threats\nover ES, and a successful attack could have economical, physical or even human\nconsequences, since many of them are used to control critical applications. A\nstandardized and general accepted security testing framework is needed to\nprovide guidance, common reporting forms, and the possibility to compare the\nresults along the time. This can be achieved by introducing security metrics\ninto the evaluation or assessment process. If carefully designed and chosen,\nmetrics could provide a quantitative, repeatable and reproducible value that\nwould reflect the level of security protection of the ES. This paper analyzes\nthe features that a good security metric should exhibit, introduces a taxonomy\nfor classifying them, and finally, it carries out a literature survey on\nsecurity metrics for the security evaluation of ES. In this review, more than\n500 metrics were collected and analyzed. Then, they were reduced to 169 metrics\nthat have the potential to be applied to ES security evaluation. As expected,\nthe 77.5 % of them is related exclusively to software, and only the 0.6 % of\nthem addresses exclusively hardware security.

Transformers process the\nsequential data as a whole, therefore they are inherently good at set\nprediction. The first vision-based transformer model, which was proposed for\nthe object detection task introduced the concept of object queries. Object\nqueries are learnable positional encodings that are used by attention modules\nin decoder layers to decode the object classes or bounding boxes using the\nregion of interests in an image.

    "title": "Complexity of Paired Domination in AT-free and Planar Graphs",
    "abstract": "For a graph $G=(V,E)$, a subset $D$ of vertex set $V$, is a dominating set of\n$G$ if every vertex not in $D$ is adjacent to atleast one vertex of $D$. A\ndominating set $D$ of a graph $G$ with no isolated vertices is called a paired\ndominating set (PD-set), if $G[D]$, the subgraph induced by $D$ in $G$ has a\nperfect matching. The Min-PD problem requires to compute a PD-set of minimum\ncardinality. The decision version of the Min-PD problem remains NP-complete\neven when $G$ belongs to restricted graph classes such as bipartite graphs,\nchordal graphs etc. On the positive side, the problem is efficiently solvable\nfor many graph classes including intervals graphs, strongly chordal graphs,\npermutation graphs etc. In this paper, we study the complexity of the problem\nin AT-free graphs and planar graph. The class of AT-free graphs contains\ncocomparability graphs, permutation graphs, trapezoid graphs, and interval\ngraphs as subclasses. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm to compute a\nminimum PD-set in AT-free graphs. In addition, we also present a linear-time\n$2$-approximation algorithm for the problem in AT-free graphs. Further, we\nprove that the decision version of the problem is NP-complete for planar\ngraphs, which answers an open question asked by Lin et al. (in Theor. Comput.\nSci., $591 (2015): 99-105$ and Algorithmica, $ 82 (2020) :2809-2840$).",

    "abstract": "Neural network pruning has remarkable performance for reducing the complexity\nof deep network models. Recent network pruning methods usually focused on\nremoving unimportant or redundant filters in the network. In this paper, by\nexploring the similarities between feature maps, we propose a novel filter\npruning method, Central Filter (CF), which suggests that a filter is\napproximately equal to a set of other filters after appropriate adjustments.\nOur method is based on the discovery that the average similarity between\nfeature maps changes very little, regardless of the number of input images.\nBased on this finding, we establish similarity graphs on feature maps and\ncalculate the closeness centrality of each node to select the Central Filter.\nMoreover, we design a method to directly adjust weights in the next layer\ncorresponding to the Central Filter, effectively minimizing the error caused by\npruning. Through experiments on various benchmark networks and datasets, CF\nyields state-of-the-art performance. For example, with ResNet-56, CF reduces\napproximately 39.7% of FLOPs by removing 47.1% of the parameters, with even\n0.33% accuracy improvement on CIFAR-10. With GoogLeNet, CF reduces\napproximately 63.2% of FLOPs by removing 55.6% of the parameters, with only a\nsmall loss of 0.35% in top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10. With ResNet-50, CF reduces\napproximately 47.9% of FLOPs by removing 36.9% of the parameters, with only a\nsmall loss of 1.07% in top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn how to perform various\ntasks from scratch. In domains like autonomous driving, recommendation systems,\nand more, optimal RL policies learned could cause a privacy breach if the\npolicies memorize any part of the private reward. We study the set of existing\ndifferentially-private RL policies derived from various RL algorithms such as\nValue Iteration, Deep Q Networks, and Vanilla Proximal Policy Optimization. We\npropose a new Privacy-Aware Inverse RL (PRIL) analysis framework, that performs\nreward reconstruction as an adversarial attack on private policies that the\nagents may deploy. For this, we introduce the reward reconstruction attack,\nwherein we seek to reconstruct the original reward from a privacy-preserving\npolicy using an Inverse RL algorithm. An adversary must do poorly at\nreconstructing the original reward function if the agent uses a tightly private\npolicy. Using this framework, we empirically test the effectiveness of the\nprivacy guarantee offered by the private algorithms on multiple instances of\nthe FrozenLake domain of varying complexities. Based on the analysis performed,\nwe infer a gap between the current standard of privacy offered and the standard\nof privacy needed to protect reward functions in RL.

The wide span of camera distance to\nthe scene yields multi-scale data with different levels of detail and spatial\ncoverage, which casts great challenges to vanilla NeRF and biases it towards\ncompromised results. To address these issues, we introduce CityNeRF, a\nprogressive learning paradigm that grows the NeRF model and training set\nsynchronously. Starting from fitting distant views with a shallow base block,\nas training progresses, new blocks are appended to accommodate the emerging\ndetails in the increasingly closer views. The strategy effectively activates\nhigh-frequency channels in the positional encoding and unfolds more complex\ndetails as the training proceeds.

In this work, we develop a small-scale\nautonomous vehicle from scratch, capable of understanding the scene using only\nvisual information, navigating through industrial environments, detecting\npeople and obstacles, or performing simple maintenance tasks. We review the\nstate-of-the-art and demonstrate that many of our approaches are similar to the\nones employed in real Self-driving cars from companies like Tesla or Lyft.\nAlso, we study possible solutions to COVID-19 situations in Industry. Finally,\nwe discuss the current state of Robotics and autonomous driving and the\ntechnological and ethical limitations that we can find in this field.",

    "title": "Rapid manufacturing of color-based hemispherical soft tactile fingertips",
    "abstract": "Tactile sensing can provide access to information about the contact (i.e.\nslippage, surface feature, friction), which is out of reach of vision but\ncrucial for manipulation. To access this information, a dense measurement of\nthe deformation of soft fingertips is necessary. Recently, tactile sensors that\nrely on a camera looking at a deformable membrane have demonstrated that a\ndense measurement of the contact is possible. However, their manufacturing can\nbe time-consuming and labor-intensive. Here, we show a new design method that\nuses multi-color additive manufacturing and silicone casting to efficiently\nmanufacture soft marker-based tactile sensors that are able to capture with\nhigh-resolution the three-dimensional deformation field at the interface. Each\nmarker is composed of two superimposed color filters. The subtractive color\nmixing encodes the normal deformation of the membrane, and the lateral\ndeformation is found by centroid detection. With this manufacturing method, we\ncan reach a density of 400 markers on a 21 mm radius hemisphere, allowing for\nregular and dense measurement of the deformation. We calibrated and validated\nthe approach by finding the curvature of objects with a threefold increase in\naccuracy as compared to previous implementations. The results demonstrate a\nsimple yet effective approach to manufacturing artificial fingertips for\ncapturing a rich image of the tactile interaction at the location of contact.",

    "abstract": "The ultimate performance of machine learning algorithms for classification\ntasks is usually measured in terms of the empirical error probability (or\naccuracy) based on a testing dataset. Whereas, these algorithms are optimized\nthrough the minimization of a typically different--more convenient--loss\nfunction based on a training set. For classification tasks, this loss function\nis often the negative log-loss that leads to the well-known cross-entropy risk\nwhich is typically better behaved (from a numerical perspective) than the error\nprobability. Conventional studies on the generalization error do not usually\ntake into account the underlying mismatch between losses at training and\ntesting phases. In this work, we introduce an analysis based on point-wise PAC\napproach over the generalization gap considering the mismatch of testing based\non the accuracy metric and training on the negative log-loss. We label this\nanalysis PACMAN. Building on the fact that the mentioned mismatch can be\nwritten as a likelihood ratio, concentration inequalities can be used to\nprovide some insights for the generalization problem in terms of some\npoint-wise PAC bounds depending on some meaningful information-theoretic\nquantities. An analysis of the obtained bounds and a comparison with available\nresults in the literature are also provided.",

    "abstract": "In this chapter, we will mainly focus on collaborative training across\nwireless devices. Training a ML model is equivalent to solving an optimization\nproblem, and many distributed optimization algorithms have been developed over\nthe last decades. These distributed ML algorithms provide data locality; that\nis, a joint model can be trained collaboratively while the data available at\neach participating device remains local. This addresses, to some extend, the\nprivacy concern. They also provide computational scalability as they allow\nexploiting computational resources distributed across many edge devices.\nHowever, in practice, this does not directly lead to a linear gain in the\noverall learning speed with the number of devices. This is partly due to the\ncommunication bottleneck limiting the overall computation speed. Additionally,\nwireless devices are highly heterogeneous in their computational capabilities,\nand both their computation speed and communication rate can be highly\ntime-varying due to physical factors. Therefore, distributed learning\nalgorithms, particularly those to be implemented at the wireless network edge,\nmust be carefully designed taking into account the impact of time-varying\ncommunication network as well as the heterogeneous and stochastic computation\ncapabilities of devices.",

    "abstract": "This article establishes a novel generic and platform-agnostic risk-aware\npath planning framework that is based on the classical $D^*$ lite planner with\na path design focus on safety and efficiency. The planner generates a grid map\nwhere the occupied/free/unknown spaces are represented with different traversal\ncosts. As it will presented, in this case, a traversal cost is added to the\nunknown voxels that are close to an occupied one. The algorithmic\nimplementation is also enhanced with a dynamic grid map that has the novel\nability to update and expand during the robotic operation and thus increase the\noverall safety of the mission and it is suitable for exploration and search and\nrescue missions. On the generated grid map, the $D^*$ lite is able to plan a\nsafer path that has a minimum traversal cost. The proposed path planning\nframework is suitable for generating 2D and 3D paths, for ground and aerial\nrobots respectively and thus in the 3D case, the grid is created with one voxel\nheight to plan for a 2D path, which is the main factor that differentiates\nbetween 2D and 3D path planning. The efficacy of the proposed novel path\nplanning scheme is extensively evaluated in multiple simulation and real-world\nfield experiments on both a quadcopter platform and the Boston Dynamics Spot\nlegged robot.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge on joint impedance during walking in various conditions is relevant\nfor clinical decision making and the development of robotic gait trainers, leg\nprostheses, leg orthotics, and wearable exoskeletons. Whereas ankle impedance\nduring walking has been experimentally assessed, knee and hip joint impedance\nduring walking have not been identified yet. Here we developed and evaluated a\nlower limb perturbator to identify hip, knee and ankle joint impedance during\ntreadmill walking. The lower limb perturbator (LOPER) consists of an actuator\nconnected to the thigh via rods. The LOPER allows to apply force perturbations\nto a free-hanging leg, while standing on the contralateral leg, with a\nbandwidth of up to 39Hz. While walking in minimal impedance mode, the\ninteraction forces between LOPER and the thigh were low (<5N) and the effect on\nthe walking pattern was smaller than the within-subject variability during\nnormal walking. Using a non-linear multibody dynamical model of swing leg\ndynamics, the hip, knee and ankle joint impedance were estimated at three time\npoints during the swing phase for nine subjects walking at a speed of 0.5 m/s.\nThe identified model was well able to predict the experimental responses, since\nthe mean variance accounted for was 99%, 96%, and 77%, for the hip, knee and\nankle respectively. The averaged across subjects stiffness varied between the\nthree time point within 34-66 Nm/rad, 0-3.5 Nm/rad, and 2.5-24 Nm/rad for the\nhip, knee and ankle joint respectively. The damping varied between 1.9-4.6\nNms/rad, 0.02-0.14 Nms/rad, and 0.2-2.4 Nms/rad for hip, knee, and ankle\nrespectively. The developed LOPER has a negligible effect on the unperturbed\nwalking pattern and allows to identify hip, knee and ankle joint impedance\nduring the swing phase.",

The bulk of the research has focused on testing\nneural-network models (for instance, their robustness and reliability as\nclassifiers). But neural-network models are defined by writing programs\n(usually written in a programming language like Python), and there is growing\nevidence that these neural-network programs often have bugs. Thus, being able\nto effectively test neural-network programs is instrumental to their\ndependability.\nThis paper presents aNNoTest: an approach to generating test inputs for\nneural-network programs. A fundamental challenge is that the dynamically-typed\nlanguages used to program neural networks cannot express detailed constraints\nabout valid function inputs. Without knowing these constraints, automated\ntest-case generation is prone to producing many invalid inputs, which trigger\nspurious failures and are useless for identifying real bugs. To address this\nproblem, we introduce a simple annotation language tailored for expressing\nvalid function inputs in neural-network programs. aNNoTest inputs an annotated\nprogram, and uses property-based testing to generate random inputs that satisfy\nthe validity constraints. In the paper, we also outline guidelines that help\nreduce the effort needed to write aNNoTest annotations.\nWe evaluated aNNoTest on 19 neural-network programs from Islam et al.'s\nsurvey. aNNoTest automatically generated test inputs that revealed 94 bugs,\nincluding 63 bugs that the survey reported for these projects. These results\nsuggest that aNNoTest can be a cost-effective approach to finding widespread\nbugs in neural-network programs.",

Less known is the\nConstrained Convex Space Partitioning (CCSP), which partitions space and makes\nthe geometric primitives exactly overlap with the boundaries of its cells.\nConsequently, it is robust against ill-fitting cells that plague methods with\naxis-aligned cells (kd-tree, BVH) and it permits an efficient, stackless\ntraversal.\nWithin computer graphics, CCSPs have received some attention in both 2D and\n3D, but their construction methods were never directly aimed at minimizing\ntheir traversal cost -- even having fundamentally opposing goals for\nDelaunay-type methods. Instead, for an isotropic and translation-invariant ray\ndistribution the traversal cost is minimized by minimizing the weight: the\ntotal boundary size of all cells in the structure.\nWe study the 2D case using triangulations as CCSPs and minimize their total\nedge length using a simulated annealing process that allows for topological\nchanges and varying vertex count. Standard Delaunay-based triangulation\ntechniques show total edge lengths ranging from 10% higher to twice as high as\nour optimized triangulations for a variety of scenes, with a similar difference\nin traversal cost when using the triangulations for ray tracing. Compared to a\nroped kd-tree, our triangulations require less traversal steps for all scenes\nthat we tested and they are robust against the kd-tree's pathological behaviour\nwhen geometry becomes misaligned with the world axes. Moreover, the stackless\ntraversal strongly outperforms a BVH, which always requires a top-down descent\nin the hierarchy. In fact, we show several scenes where the number of traversal\noperations for our triangulations decreases(!) as the number of geometric\nprimitives $N$ increases, in contrast to the increasing $\\log N$ behaviour of a\nBVH.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a computational modeling account of an active self\nin artificial agents. In particular we focus on how an agent can be equipped\nwith a sense of control and how it arises in autonomous situated action and, in\nturn, influences action control. We argue that this requires laying out an\nembodied cognitive model that combines bottom-up processes (sensorimotor\nlearning and fine-grained adaptation of control) with top-down processes\n(cognitive processes for strategy selection and decision-making). We present\nsuch a conceptual computational architecture based on principles of predictive\nprocessing and free energy minimization. Using this general model, we describe\nhow a sense of control can form across the levels of a control hierarchy and\nhow this can support action control in an unpredictable environment. We present\nan implementation of this model as well as first evaluations in a simulated\ntask scenario, in which an autonomous agent has to cope with un-/predictable\nsituations and experiences corresponding sense of control. We explore different\nmodel parameter settings that lead to different ways of combining low-level and\nhigh-level action control. The results show the importance of appropriately\nweighting information in situations where the need for low/high-level action\ncontrol varies and they demonstrate how the sense of control can facilitate\nthis.",

Recent works typically use object or action classifier to detect\nand provide labels for anomalous events. However, this constrains detection\nsystems to a finite set of known classes and prevents generalisation to unknown\nobjects or behaviours. Here we show how to robustly detect anomalies without\nthe use of object or action classifiers yet still recover the high level reason\nbehind the event.

    "abstract": "Most existing vision-language pre-training methods focus on understanding\ntasks and use BERT-like objectives (masked language modeling and image-text\nmatching) during pretraining. Although they perform well in many understanding\ndownstream tasks, e.g., visual question answering, image-text retrieval and\nvisual entailment, they do not possess the ability to generate. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose Unified multimodal pre-training for both Vision-Language\nunderstanding and generation (UniVL). The proposed UniVL is capable of handling\nboth understanding tasks and generative tasks. We augment existing pretraining\nparadigms that only use random masks with causal masks, i.e., triangular masks\nthat mask out future tokens, such that the pre-trained models can have\nautoregressive generation abilities by design. We formulate several previous\nunderstanding tasks as a text generation task and propose to use prompt-based\nmethod for fine-tuning on different downstream tasks. Our experiments show that\nthere is a trade-off between understanding tasks and generation tasks while\nusing the same model, and a feasible way to improve both tasks is to use more\ndata. Our UniVL framework attains comparable performance to recent\nvision-language pre-training methods on both understanding tasks and generation\ntasks.

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) models, especially those large-scale and high-performance\nones, can be very costly to train, demanding a great amount of data and\ncomputational resources. Unauthorized reproduction of DL models can lead to\ncopyright infringement and cause huge economic losses to model owners. Existing\ncopyright protection techniques are mostly based on watermarking, which embeds\nan owner-specified watermark into the model. While being able to provide exact\nownership verification, these techniques are 1) invasive, as they need to\ntamper with the training process, which may affect the utility or introduce new\nsecurity risks; 2) prone to adaptive attacks that attempt to remove the\nwatermark; and 3) not robust to the emerging model extraction attacks. Latest\nfingerprinting work, though being non-invasive, also falls short when facing\nthe diverse and ever-growing attack scenarios. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel testing framework for DL copyright protection: DEEPJUDGE. DEEPJUDGE\nquantitatively tests the similarities between two DL models: a victim model and\na suspect model. It leverages a diverse set of testing metrics and test case\ngeneration methods to produce a chain of supporting evidence to help determine\nwhether a suspect model is a copy of the victim model. Advantages of DEEPJUDGE\ninclude: 1) non-invasive, as it works directly on the model and does not tamper\nwith the training process; 2) efficient, as it only needs a small set of test\ncases and a quick scan of models; 3) flexible, as it can easily incorporate new\nmetrics or generation methods to obtain more confident judgement; and 4) fairly\nrobust to model extraction and adaptive attacks. We verify the effectiveness of\nDEEPJUDGE under typical copyright infringement scenarios, including model\nfinetuning, pruning and extraction, via extensive experiments on both image and\nspeech datasets with a variety of model architectures.",

However, the\noptimal trade-off among list-decoding (resp. list-recovery) radius, list size,\nand the code rate are not fully understood in both problems. This paper takes a\nstep towards this direction when the list size is a given constant and the\nalphabet size is large (as a function of the code length). We prove a new\nSingleton-type upper bound for list-decodable codes, which improves upon the\npreviously known bound by roughly a factor of $1/L$, where $L$ is the list\nsize. We also prove a Singleton-type upper bound for list-recoverable codes,\nwhich is to the best of our knowledge, the first such bound for list-recovery.\nWe apply these results to obtain new lower bounds that are optimal up to a\nmultiplicative constant on the list size for list-decodable and\nlist-recoverable codes with rates approaching capacity.\nMoreover, we show that list-decodable \\emph{nonlinear} codes can strictly\noutperform list-decodable linear codes. More precisely, we show that there is a\ngap for a wide range of parameters, which grows fast with the alphabet size,\nbetween the size of the largest list-decodable nonlinear code and the size of\nthe largest list-decodable linear codes. This is achieved by a novel connection\nbetween list-decoding and the notion of sparse hypergraphs in extremal\ncombinatorics.

However, it relies on labour-intensive systematic reviews,\nwhere domain specialists must aggregate and extract information from thousands\nof publications, primarily of randomised controlled trial (RCT) results, into\nevidence tables. This paper investigates automating evidence table generation\nby decomposing the problem across two language processing tasks: \\textit{named\nentity recognition}, which identifies key entities within text, such as drug\nnames, and \\textit{relation extraction}, which maps their relationships for\nseparating them into ordered tuples. We focus on the automatic tabulation of\nsentences from published RCT abstracts that report the results of the study\noutcomes. Two deep neural net models were developed as part of a joint\nextraction pipeline, using the principles of transfer learning and\ntransformer-based language representations. To train and test these models, a\nnew gold-standard corpus was developed, comprising almost 600 result sentences\nfrom six disease areas. This approach demonstrated significant advantages, with\nour system performing well across multiple natural language processing tasks\nand disease areas, as well as in generalising to disease domains unseen during\ntraining. Furthermore, we show these results were achievable through training\nour models on as few as 200 example sentences.

Especially in the context of optimization approaches this\nknowledge is crucial in order to realize an efficient design process and\nachieve high-performing results. Information theory provides powerful tools to\ninvestigate these relationships because measures are model-free and thus also\ncapture non-linear relationships, while requiring only minimal assumptions on\nthe input data. We therefore propose to use recently introduced\ninformation-theoretic methods and estimation algorithms to find the most\ninfluential input parameters in optimization results. The proposed methods are\nin particular able to account for interactions between parameters, which are\noften neglected but may lead to redundant or synergistic contributions of\nmultiple parameters. We demonstrate the application of these methods on\noptimization data from aerospace engineering, where we first identify the most\nrelevant optimization parameters using a recently introduced\ninformation-theoretic feature-selection algorithm that accounts for\ninteractions between parameters. Second, we use the novel partial information\ndecomposition (PID) framework that allows to quantify redundant and synergistic\ncontributions between selected parameters with respect to the optimization\noutcome to identify parameter interactions. We thus demonstrate the power of\nnovel information-theoretic approaches in identifying relevant parameters in\noptimization runs and highlight how these methods avoid the selection of\nredundant parameters, while detecting interactions that result in synergistic\ncontributions of multiple parameters.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the fundamental principles behind the massive success of neural\nnetworks is one of the most important open questions in deep learning. However,\ndue to the highly complex nature of the problem, progress has been relatively\nslow. In this note, through the lens of infinite-width networks, a.k.a. neural\nkernels, we present one such principle resulting from hierarchical localities.\nIt is well-known that the eigenstructure of infinite-width multilayer\nperceptrons (MLPs) depends solely on the concept frequency, which measures the\norder of interactions. We show that the topologies from deep convolutional\nnetworks (CNNs) restructure the associated eigenspaces into finer subspaces. In\naddition to frequency, the new structure also depends on the concept space,\nwhich measures the spatial distance among nonlinear interaction terms. The\nresulting fine-grained eigenstructure dramatically improves the network's\nlearnability, empowering them to simultaneously model a much richer class of\ninteractions, including Long-Range-Low-Frequency interactions,\nShort-Range-High-Frequency interactions, and various interpolations and\nextrapolations in-between. Additionally, model scaling can improve the\nresolutions of interpolations and extrapolations and, therefore, the network's\nlearnability. Finally, we prove a sharp characterization of the generalization\nerror for infinite-width CNNs of any depth in the high-dimensional setting. Two\ncorollaries follow: (1) infinite-width deep CNNs can break the curse of\ndimensionality without losing their expressivity, and (2) scaling improves\nperformance in both the finite and infinite data regimes.",

The\ncurrent SAS paradigm prescribed by the FCC for the CBRS band and standardized\nby the WInnForum follows a centralized service model in that a spectrum user\nsubscribes to a SAS server for spectrum allocation service. This model,\nhowever, neither tolerates SAS server failures (crash or Byzantine) nor resists\ndishonest SAS administrators, leading to serious concerns on SAS system\nreliability and trustworthiness. This is especially concerning for the evolving\nDSS landscape where an increasing number of SAS service providers and\nheterogeneous user requirements are coming up. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel blockchain-based decentralized SAS architecture called BD-SAS\nthat provides SAS services securely and efficiently, without relying on the\ntrust of each individual SAS server for the overall system trustworthiness. In\nBD-SAS, a global blockchain (G-Chain) is used for spectrum regulatory\ncompliance while smart contract-enabled local blockchains (L-Chains) are\ninstantiated in individual spectrum zones for automating spectrum access\nassignment per user request.

    "abstract": "Increasing problems in the transportation segment are accidents, bad traffic\nflow and pollution. The Intelligent Transportation System with the use of\nexternal infrastructure (ITS) can tackle these problems. To the best of our\nknowledge, there exists no current systematic review of the existing solutions.\nTo fill this knowledge gap, this paper provides an overview about existing ITS\nwhich use external infrastructure. Furthermore, this paper discovers the\ncurrently not adequately answered research questions. For this reason, we\nperformed a literature review to documents, which describes existing ITS\nsolutions since 2009 until today. We categorized the results according to his\ntechnology level and analyzed their properties. Thereby, we made the several\nITS comparable and highlighted the past development as well as the current\ntrends. According to the mentioned method, we analyzed more than 346 papers,\nwhich includes 40 test bed projects. In summary, the current ITS can deliver\nhigh accurate information about individuals in traffic situations in real-time.\nHowever, further research in ITS should focus on more reliable perception of\nthe traffic with the use of modern sensors, plug and play mechanism as well as\nsecure real-time distribution in decentralized manner for a high amount of\ndata. With addressing these topics, the development of Intelligent\nTransportation Systems is in a correction direction for the comprehensive\nroll-out.",

    "abstract": "The advent of scientific machine learning (SciML) has opened up a new field\nwith many promises and challenges in the field of simulation science by\ndeveloping approaches at the interface of physics- and data-based modelling. To\nthis end, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been introduced in\nrecent years, which cope for the scarcity in training data by incorporating\nphysics knowledge of the problem at so-called collocation points. In this work,\nwe investigate the prediction performance of PINNs with respect to the number\nof collocation points used to enforce the physics-based penalty terms. We show\nthat PINNs can fail, learning a trivial solution that fulfills the\nphysics-derived penalty term by definition. We have developed an alternative\nsampling approach and a new penalty term enabling us to remedy this core\nproblem of PINNs in data-scarce settings with competitive results while\nreducing the amount of collocation points needed by up to 80 \\% for benchmark\nproblems.",

Traditional\nvideo-based person Re-ID methods focus on exploring appearance information,\nthus, vulnerable against illumination changes, scene noises, camera parameters,\nand especially clothes/carrying variations. Gait recognition provides an\nimplicit biometric solution to alleviate the above headache. Nonetheless, it\nexperiences severe performance degeneration as camera view varies. In an\nattempt to address these problems, in this paper, we propose a framework that\nutilizes the sequence masks (SeqMasks) in the video to integrate appearance\ninformation and gait modeling in a close fashion. Specifically, to sufficiently\nvalidate the effectiveness of our method, we build a novel dataset named\nMaskMARS based on MARS.

    "abstract": "We consider a general multi-connectivity framework, intended for\nultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) services, and propose a\nnovel, preallocation-based combinatorial auction approach for the efficient\nallocation of channels. We compare the performance of the proposed method with\nseveral other state-of-the-art and alternative channel-allocation algorithms.\nThe two proposed performance metrics are the capacity-based and the\nutility-based context. In the first case, every unit of additional capacity is\nregarded as beneficial for any tenant, independent of the already allocated\nquantity, and the main measure is the total throughput of the system. In the\nsecond case, we assume a minimal and maximal required capacity value for each\ntenant, and consider the implied utility values accordingly. In addition to the\ntotal system performance, we also analyze fairness and computational\nrequirements in both contexts. We conclude that at the cost of higher but still\nplausible computational time, the fairness-enhanced version of the proposed\npreallocation based combinatorial auction algorithm outperforms every other\nconsidered method when one considers total system performance and fairness\nsimultaneously, and performs especially well in the utility context. Therefore,\nthe proposed algorithm may be regarded as candidate scheme for URLLC channel\nallocation problems, where minimal and maximal capacity requirements have to be\nconsidered.",

    "abstract": "Discrimination in selection problems such as hiring or college admission is\noften explained by implicit bias from the decision maker against disadvantaged\ndemographic groups. In this paper, we consider a model where the decision maker\nreceives a noisy estimate of each candidate's quality, whose variance depends\non the candidate's group -- we argue that such differential variance is a key\nfeature of many selection problems. We analyze two notable settings: in the\nfirst, the noise variances are unknown to the decision maker who simply picks\nthe candidates with the highest estimated quality independently of their group;\nin the second, the variances are known and the decision maker picks candidates\nhaving the highest expected quality given the noisy estimate. We show that both\nbaseline decision makers yield discrimination, although in opposite directions:\nthe first leads to underrepresentation of the low-variance group while the\nsecond leads to underrepresentation of the high-variance group. We study the\neffect on the selection utility of imposing a fairness mechanism that we term\nthe $\\gamma$-rule (it is an extension of the classical four-fifths rule and it\nalso includes demographic parity). In the first setting (with unknown\nvariances), we prove that under mild conditions, imposing the $\\gamma$-rule\nincreases the selection utility -- here there is no trade-off between fairness\nand utility. In the second setting (with known variances), imposing the\n$\\gamma$-rule decreases the utility but we prove a bound on the utility loss\ndue to the fairness mechanism.",

It can render high fidelity head images in real-time, and\nsupports directly controlling the generated images' rendering pose and various\nsemantic attributes. Different from existing related parametric models, we use\nthe neural radiance fields as a novel 3D proxy instead of the traditional 3D\ntextured mesh, which makes that HeadNeRF is able to generate high fidelity\nimages. However, the computationally expensive rendering process of the\noriginal NeRF hinders the construction of the parametric NeRF model. To address\nthis issue, we adopt the strategy of integrating 2D neural rendering to the\nrendering process of NeRF and design novel loss terms. As a result, the\nrendering speed of HeadNeRF can be significantly accelerated, and the rendering\ntime of one frame is reduced from 5s to 25ms. The novel-designed loss terms\nalso improve the rendering accuracy, and the fine-level details of the human\nhead, such as the gaps between teeth, wrinkles, and beards, can be represented\nand synthesized by HeadNeRF. Extensive experimental results and several\napplications demonstrate its effectiveness. We will release the code and\ntrained model to the public.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning has been proven suitable for learning sentence\nembeddings and can significantly improve the semantic textual similarity (STS)\ntasks. Recently, large contrastive learning models, e.g., Sentence-T5, tend to\nbe proposed to learn more powerful sentence embeddings. Though effective, such\nlarge models are hard to serve online due to computational resources or time\ncost limits. To tackle that, knowledge distillation (KD) is commonly adopted,\nwhich can compress a large \"teacher\" model into a small \"student\" model but\ngenerally suffer from some performance loss. Here we propose an enhanced KD\nframework termed Distill-Contrast (DisCo). The proposed DisCo framework firstly\nutilizes KD to transfer the capability of a large sentence embedding model to a\nsmall student model on large unlabelled data, and then finetunes the student\nmodel with contrastive learning on labelled training data. For the KD process\nin DisCo, we further propose Contrastive Knowledge Distillation (CKD) to\nenhance the consistencies among teacher model training, KD, and student model\nfinetuning, which can probably improve performance like prompt learning.\nExtensive experiments on 7 STS benchmarks show that student models trained with\nthe proposed DisCo and CKD suffer from little or even no performance loss and\nconsistently outperform the corresponding counterparts of the same parameter\nsize. Amazingly, our 110M student model can even outperform the latest\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) model, i.e., Sentence-T5(11B), with only 1% parameters.",

We then discuss different\nstrategies for solving the problem, and design two representative pipelines:\none uses available 2D floor plans to guide selection and deformation of 3D\nrooms; the other learns to retrieve a set of compatible 3D rooms and combine\nthem into novel layouts. We design a set of metrics that evaluate the generated\nresults with respect to each of the three subtasks and show that different\nmethods trade off performance on these subtasks.

    "abstract": "The emergence of the global COVID-19 pandemic poses new challenges for\nbiometrics. Not only are contactless biometric identification options becoming\nmore important, but face recognition has also recently been confronted with the\nfrequent wearing of masks. These masks affect the performance of previous face\nrecognition systems, as they hide important identity information. In this\npaper, we propose a mask-invariant face recognition solution (MaskInv) that\nutilizes template-level knowledge distillation within a training paradigm that\naims at producing embeddings of masked faces that are similar to those of\nnon-masked faces of the same identities. In addition to the distilled\nknowledge, the student network benefits from additional guidance by\nmargin-based identity classification loss, ElasticFace, using masked and\nnon-masked faces. In a step-wise ablation study on two real masked face\ndatabases and five mainstream databases with synthetic masks, we prove the\nrationalization of our MaskInv approach. Our proposed solution outperforms\nprevious state-of-the-art (SOTA) academic solutions in the recent MFRC-21\nchallenge in both scenarios, masked vs masked and masked vs non-masked, and\nalso outperforms the previous solution on the MFR2 dataset. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that the proposed model can still perform well on unmasked faces\nwith only a minor loss in verification performance.

    "abstract": "Computation in several real-world applications like probabilistic machine\nlearning, sparse linear algebra, and robotic navigation, can be modeled as\nirregular directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The irregular data dependencies in\nDAGs pose challenges to parallel execution on general-purpose CPUs and GPUs,\nresulting in severe under-utilization of the hardware. This paper proposes DPU,\na specialized processor designed for the efficient execution of irregular DAGs.\nThe DPU is equipped with parallel compute units that execute different\nsubgraphs of a DAG independently. The compute units can synchronize within a\ncycle using a hardware-supported synchronization primitive, and communicate via\nan efficient interconnect to a global banked scratchpad. Furthermore, a\nprecision-scalable posit arithmetic unit is developed to enable\napplication-dependent precision. The DPU is taped-out in 28nm CMOS, achieving a\nspeedup of 5.1$\\times$ and 20.6$\\times$ over state-of-the-art CPU and GPU\nimplementations on DAGs of sparse linear algebra and probabilistic machine\nlearning workloads. This performance is achieved while operating at a power\nbudget of 0.23W, as opposed to 55W and 98W of the CPU and GPU, resulting in a\npeak efficiency of 538 GOPS/W with DPU, which is 1350$\\times$ and 9000$\\times$\nhigher than the CPU and GPU, respectively. Thus, with specialized architecture,\nDPU enables low-power execution of irregular DAG workloads.",

    "abstract": "Neural Information Retrieval models hold the promise to replace lexical\nmatching models, e.g. BM25, in modern search engines. While their capabilities\nhave fully shone on in-domain datasets like MS MARCO, they have recently been\nchallenged on out-of-domain zero-shot settings (BEIR benchmark), questioning\ntheir actual generalization capabilities compared to bag-of-words approaches.\nParticularly, we wonder if these shortcomings could (partly) be the consequence\nof the inability of neural IR models to perform lexical matching\noff-the-shelf.In this work, we propose a measure of discrepancy between the\nlexical matching performed by any (neural) model and an 'ideal' one. Based on\nthis, we study the behavior of different state-of-the-art neural IR models,\nfocusing on whether they are able to perform lexical matching when it's\nactually useful, i.e. for important terms. Overall, we show that neural IR\nmodels fail to properly generalize term importance on out-of-domain collections\nor terms almost unseen during training",

Despite dramatic progress made by Deep Learning,\nmulti-sensor deep odometry systems yet pose a high computational cost and\nsuffer from cumulative drifting errors over time. Thanks to the increasing\ncomputational power of edge devices, we propose a novel ubiquitous positioning\nsolution by integrating state-of-the-art deep odometry models on edge with an\nEKF (Extended Kalman Filter)-LoRa backend. We carefully compare and select\nthree sensor modalities, i.e., an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a\nmillimetre-wave (mmWave) radar, and a thermal infrared camera, and realise\ntheir deep odometry inference engines which runs in real-time. A pipeline of\ndeploying deep odometry considering accuracy, complexity, and edge platform is\nproposed. We design a LoRa link for positional data backhaul and projecting\naggregated positions of deep odometry into the global frame. We find that a\nsimple EKF based fusion module is sufficient for generic positioning\ncalibration with over 34% accuracy gains against any standalone deep odometry\nsystem.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an ensemble of deep neural networks along with data\naugmentation (DA) learned using effective speech-based features to recognize\nemotions from speech. Our ensemble model is built on three deep neural\nnetwork-based models. These neural networks are built using the basic local\nfeature acquiring blocks (LFAB) which are consecutive layers of dilated 1D\nConvolutional Neural networks followed by the max pooling and batch\nnormalization layers. To acquire the long-term dependencies in speech signals\nfurther two variants are proposed by adding Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long\nShort Term Memory (LSTM) layers respectively. All three network models have\nconsecutive fully connected layers before the final softmax layer for\nclassification. The ensemble model uses a weighted average to provide the final\nclassification. We have utilized five standard benchmark datasets: TESS,\nEMO-DB, RAVDESS, SAVEE, and CREMA-D for evaluation. We have performed DA by\ninjecting Additive White Gaussian Noise, pitch shifting, and stretching the\nsignal level to generalize the models, and thus increasing the accuracy of the\nmodels and reducing the overfitting as well. We handcrafted five categories of\nfeatures: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, Log Mel-Scaled Spectrogram,\nZero-Crossing Rate, Chromagram, and statistical Root Mean Square Energy value\nfrom each audio sample. These features are used as the input to the LFAB blocks\nthat further extract the hidden local features which are then fed to either\nfully connected layers or to LSTM or GRU based on the model type to acquire the\nadditional long-term contextual representations. LFAB followed by GRU or LSTM\nresults in better performance compared to the baseline model. The ensemble\nmodel achieves the state-of-the-art weighted average accuracy in all the\ndatasets.",

Due to the\npervasive outbreak of COVID-19, wearing a mask and hand hygiene appear to be\nthe most effective ways for the public to curb the spread of these viruses. The\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) recommends a guideline for alcohol-based hand\nrub in eight steps to ensure that all surfaces of hands are entirely clean.

Various DNN architectures\nwere tested, and an Inception-ResNet model led to the best results with 97%\ntest accuracy.

    "abstract": "Central to active learning (AL) is what data should be selected for\nannotation. Existing works attempt to select highly uncertain or informative\ndata for annotation. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how selected data impacts\nthe test performance of the task model used in AL. In this work, we explore\nsuch an impact by theoretically proving that selecting unlabeled data of higher\ngradient norm leads to a lower upper bound of test loss, resulting in a better\ntest performance. However, due to the lack of label information, directly\ncomputing gradient norm for unlabeled data is infeasible. To address this\nchallenge, we propose two schemes, namely expected-gradnorm and\nentropy-gradnorm. The former computes the gradient norm by constructing an\nexpected empirical loss while the latter constructs an unsupervised loss with\nentropy. Furthermore, we integrate the two schemes in a universal AL framework.\nWe evaluate our method on classical image classification and semantic\nsegmentation tasks. To demonstrate its competency in domain applications and\nits robustness to noise, we also validate our method on a cellular imaging\nanalysis task, namely cryo-Electron Tomography subtomogram classification.\nResults demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance against the\nstate-of-the-art.

These methods rely on historical labeled\ndata and cannot accurately predict events when data are limited or of poor\nquality. Studying causal effects between events goes beyond correlation\nanalysis and can contribute to a more robust prediction of events. However,\nincorporating causality analysis in data-driven event forecasting is\nchallenging due to several factors: (i) Events occur in a complex and dynamic\nsocial environment. Many unobserved variables, i.e., hidden confounders, affect\nboth potential causes and outcomes.

Two robust learning modules, including a feature reweighting module\nand an approximate constraint loss, are introduced to enable prior knowledge\ninjection. We evaluate the proposed causal inference model on real-world event\ndatasets and validate the effectiveness of proposed robust learning modules in\nevent prediction by feeding learned causal information into different deep\nlearning methods.

    "abstract": "Energy-Based Models (EBMs) allow for extremely flexible specifications of\nprobability distributions. However, they do not provide a mechanism for\nobtaining exact samples from these distributions. Monte Carlo techniques can\naid us in obtaining samples if some proposal distribution that we can easily\nsample from is available. For instance, rejection sampling can provide exact\nsamples but is often difficult or impossible to apply due to the need to find a\nproposal distribution that upper-bounds the target distribution everywhere.\nApproximate Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques like\nMetropolis-Hastings are usually easier to design, exploiting a local proposal\ndistribution that performs local edits on an evolving sample. However, these\ntechniques can be inefficient due to the local nature of the proposal\ndistribution and do not provide an estimate of the quality of their samples. In\nthis work, we propose a new approximate sampling technique, Quasi Rejection\nSampling (QRS), that allows for a trade-off between sampling efficiency and\nsampling quality, while providing explicit convergence bounds and diagnostics.\nQRS capitalizes on the availability of high-quality global proposal\ndistributions obtained from deep learning models. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of QRS sampling for discrete EBMs over text for the tasks of\ncontrolled text generation with distributional constraints and paraphrase\ngeneration. We show that we can sample from such EBMs with arbitrary precision\nat the cost of sampling efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The sizes of pretrained language models make them challenging and expensive\nto use when there are multiple desired downstream tasks. In this work, we adopt\nrecent strategies for model pruning during finetuning to explore the question\nof whether it is possible to prune a single encoder so that it can be used for\nmultiple tasks. We allocate a fixed parameter budget and compare pruning a\nsingle model with a multitask objective against the best ensemble of\nsingle-task models. We find that under two pruning strategies (element-wise and\nrank pruning), the approach with the multitask objective outperforms training\nmodels separately when averaged across all tasks, and it is competitive on each\nindividual one. Additional analysis finds that using a multitask objective\nduring pruning can also be an effective method for reducing model sizes for\nlow-resource tasks.",

A linear time algorithm for computing the longest letter-duplicated\nsubsequence (LLDS) of $S$ can be easily obtained. In this paper, we focus on\ntwo variants of this problem. We first consider the constrained version when\n$\\Sigma$ is unbounded, each letter appears in $S$ at least 6 times and all the\nletters in $\\Sigma$ must appear in the solution. We show that the problem is\nNP-hard (a further twist indicates that the problem does not admit any\npolynomial time approximation). The reduction is from possibly the simplest\nversion of SAT that is NP-complete, $(\\leq 2,1,\\leq 3)$-SAT, where each\nvariable appears at most twice positively and exact once negatively, and each\nclause contains at most three literals and some clauses must contain exactly\ntwo literals. (We hope that this technique will serve as a general tool to help\nus proving the NP-hardness for some more tricky sequence problems involving\nonly one sequence -- much harder than with at least two input sequences, which\nwe apply successfully at the end of the paper on some extra variations of the\nLLDS problem.) We then show that when each letter appears in $S$ at most 3\ntimes, then the problem admits a factor $1.5-O(\\frac{1}{n})$ approximation.\nFinally, we consider the weighted version, where the weight of a block\n$x_i^{d_i} (d_i\\geq 2)$ could be any positive function which might not grow\nwith $d_i$. We give a non-trivial $O(n^2)$ time dynamic programming algorithm\nfor this version, i.e., computing an LD-subsequence of $S$ whose weight is\nmaximized.",

Furthermore,\nits application to inverse problems have demonstrated state-of-the-art\nperformance. Unfortunately, diffusion models have a critical downside - they\nare inherently slow to sample from, needing few thousand steps of iteration to\ngenerate images from pure Gaussian noise. In this work, we show that starting\nfrom Gaussian noise is unnecessary. Instead, starting from a single forward\ndiffusion with better initialization significantly reduces the number of\nsampling steps in the reverse conditional diffusion. This phenomenon is\nformally explained by the contraction theory of the stochastic difference\nequations like our conditional diffusion strategy - the alternating\napplications of reverse diffusion followed by a non-expansive data consistency\nstep. The new sampling strategy, dubbed Come-Closer-Diffuse-Faster (CCDF), also\nreveals a new insight on how the existing feed-forward neural network\napproaches for inverse problems can be synergistically combined with the\ndiffusion models.

In recent years, a variety of\ndeep learning techniques have been developed to address this challenging task.\nA typical framework is to simultaneously estimate the illumination and\nreflectance, but they disregard the scene-level contextual information\nencapsulated in feature spaces, causing many unfavorable outcomes, e.g.,\ndetails loss, color unsaturation, artifacts, and so on. To address these\nissues, we develop a new context-sensitive decomposition network architecture\nto exploit the scene-level contextual dependencies on spatial scales. More\nconcretely, we build a two-stream estimation mechanism including reflectance\nand illumination estimation network. We design a novel context-sensitive\ndecomposition connection to bridge the two-stream mechanism by incorporating\nthe physical principle.

    "title": "DiffuseMorph: Unsupervised Deformable Image Registration Along  Continuous Trajectory Using Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "Deformable image registration is one of the fundamental tasks for medical\nimaging and computer vision. Classical registration algorithms usually rely on\niterative optimization approaches to provide accurate deformation, which\nrequires high computational cost. Although many deep-learning-based methods\nhave been developed to carry out fast image registration, it is still\nchallenging to estimate the deformation field with less topological folding\nproblem. Furthermore, these approaches only enable registration to a single\nfixed image, and it is not possible to obtain continuously varying registration\nresults between the moving and fixed images. To address this, here we present a\nnovel approach of diffusion model-based probabilistic image registration,\ncalled DiffuseMorph. Specifically, our model learns the score function of the\ndeformation between moving and fixed images. Similar to the existing diffusion\nmodels, DiffuseMorph not only provides synthetic deformed images through a\nreverse diffusion process, but also enables various levels of deformation of\nthe moving image along with the latent space. Experimental results on 2D face\nexpression image and 3D brain image registration tasks demonstrate that our\nmethod can provide flexible and accurate deformation with a capability of\ntopology preservation.",

    "abstract": "The success of the state-of-the-art video deblurring methods stems mainly\nfrom implicit or explicit estimation of alignment among the adjacent frames for\nlatent video restoration. However, due to the influence of the blur effect,\nestimating the alignment information from the blurry adjacent frames is not a\ntrivial task. Inaccurate estimations will interfere the following frame\nrestoration. Instead of estimating alignment information, we propose a simple\nand effective deep Recurrent Neural Network with Multi-scale Bi-directional\nPropagation (RNN-MBP) to effectively propagate and gather the information from\nunaligned neighboring frames for better video deblurring. Specifically, we\nbuild a Multi-scale Bi-directional Propagation~(MBP) module with two U-Net RNN\ncells which can directly exploit the inter-frame information from unaligned\nneighboring hidden states by integrating them in different scales. Moreover, to\nbetter evaluate the proposed algorithm and existing state-of-the-art methods on\nreal-world blurry scenes, we also create a Real-World Blurry Video Dataset\n(RBVD) by a well-designed Digital Video Acquisition System (DVAS) and use it as\nthe training and evaluation dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed RBVD dataset effectively improves the performance of existing\nalgorithms on real-world blurry videos, and the proposed algorithm performs\nfavorably against the state-of-the-art methods on three typical benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based diagnostic performance increases with more annotated\ndata, but manual annotation is a bottleneck in most fields. Experts evaluate\ndiagnostic images during clinical routine, and write their findings in reports.\nAutomatic annotation based on clinical reports could overcome the manual\nlabelling bottleneck. We hypothesise that dense annotations for detection tasks\ncan be generated using model predictions, guided by sparse information from\nthese reports. To demonstrate efficacy, we generated clinically significant\nprostate cancer (csPCa) annotations, guided by the number of clinically\nsignificant findings in the radiology reports. We included 7,756 prostate MRI\nexaminations, of which 3,050 were manually annotated and 4,706 were\nautomatically annotated. We evaluated the automatic annotation quality on the\nmanually annotated subset: our score extraction correctly identified the number\nof csPCa lesions for $99.3\\%$ of the reports and our csPCa segmentation model\ncorrectly localised $83.8 \\pm 1.1\\%$ of the lesions. We evaluated prostate\ncancer detection performance on 300 exams from an external centre with\nhistopathology-confirmed ground truth. Augmenting the training set with\nautomatically labelled exams improved patient-based diagnostic area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic curve from $88.1\\pm 1.1\\%$ to $89.8\\pm 1.0\\%$\n($P = 1.2 \\cdot 10^{-4}$) and improved lesion-based sensitivity at one false\npositive per case from $79.2 \\pm 2.8\\%$ to $85.4 \\pm 1.9\\%$ ($P<10^{-4}$), with\n$mean \\pm std.$ over 15 independent runs.

Although several algorithms have been designed to select\npixel-wise adaptive forward paths for natural image analysis, it still lacks\ntheoretical supports on how to obtain optimal selections. In this paper, we\nprovide mathematical analyses in terms of the parameter optimization, which\nguides us to design a method called Hidden Path Selection Network (HPS-Net).\nWith the help of hidden variables derived from an extra mini-branch, HPS-Net is\nable to tackle the inherent problem about inaccessible global optimums by\nadjusting the direct relationships between feature maps and pixel-wise path\nselections in existing algorithms, which we call hidden path selection. For the\nbetter training and evaluation, we further refine and expand the 5-class Gaofen\nImage Dataset (GID-5) to a new one with 15 land-cover categories, i.e., GID-15.\nThe experimental results on both GID-5 and GID-15 demonstrate that the proposed\nmodules can stably improve the performance of different deep structures, which\nvalidates the proposed mathematical analyses.",

The dynamic range of conventional sensors,\nhowever, is fundamentally limited by their well capacity, resulting in\nsaturation of bright scene parts. To overcome this limitation, emerging sensors\noffer in-pixel processing capabilities to encode the incident irradiance. Among\nthe most promising encoding schemes is modulo wrapping, which results in a\ncomputational photography problem where the HDR scene is computed by an\nirradiance unwrapping algorithm from the wrapped low-dynamic-range (LDR) sensor\nimage. Here, we design a neural network--based algorithm that outperforms\nprevious irradiance unwrapping methods and, more importantly, we design a\nperceptually inspired \"mantissa\" encoding scheme that more efficiently wraps an\nHDR scene into an LDR sensor.

HER2 staining demands laborious tissue treatment\nand chemical processing performed by a histotechnologist, which typically takes\none day to prepare in a laboratory, increasing analysis time and associated\ncosts. Here, we describe a deep learning-based virtual HER2 IHC staining method\nusing a conditional generative adversarial network that is trained to rapidly\ntransform autofluorescence microscopic images of unlabeled/label-free breast\ntissue sections into bright-field equivalent microscopic images, matching the\nstandard HER2 IHC staining that is chemically performed on the same tissue\nsections. The efficacy of this virtual HER2 staining framework was demonstrated\nby quantitative analysis, in which three board-certified breast pathologists\nblindly graded the HER2 scores of virtually stained and immunohistochemically\nstained HER2 whole slide images (WSIs) to reveal that the HER2 scores\ndetermined by inspecting virtual IHC images are as accurate as their\nimmunohistochemically stained counterparts. A second quantitative blinded study\nperformed by the same diagnosticians further revealed that the virtually\nstained HER2 images exhibit a comparable staining quality in the level of\nnuclear detail, membrane clearness, and absence of staining artifacts with\nrespect to their immunohistochemically stained counterparts. This virtual HER2\nstaining framework bypasses the costly, laborious, and time-consuming IHC\nstaining procedures in laboratory, and can be extended to other types of\nbiomarkers to accelerate the IHC tissue staining used in life sciences and\nbiomedical workflow.",

This technique is particularly useful in biomedical diagnostic\napplications ranging from hemodynamic analysis of cardiovascular systems to\nocular circulation. However, simulating dyes governed by convection-diffusion\npartial differential equations (PDEs) can also be a useful post-processing\nanalysis approach for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications. Such\nsimulations can be used to identify the relative significance of different\nspatial subregions in particular time intervals of interest in an unsteady flow\nfield. Additionally, dye evolution is closely related to non-discrete particle\nresidence time (PRT) calculations that are governed by similar PDEs. PRT is a\nwidely used metric for various fluid dynamics applications (e.g., environmental\nfluids, biological flows) and is a well-accepted biomarker for cardiovascular\ndiseases since it is linked to thrombus formation. This contribution introduces\na pseudo-spectral method based on Fourier continuation (FC) for conducting dye\nsimulations and non-discrete particle residence time calculations without\nnumerical diffusion errors. Convergence and error analyses are performed with\nboth manufactured and analytical solutions. The methodology is applied to three\ndistinct physical/physiological cases: 1) flow over a two-dimensional (2D)\ncavity; 2) pulsatile flow in a simplified partially-grafted aortic dissection\nmodel; and 3) non-Newtonian blood flow in a Fontan graft.

    "abstract": "Within the scientific research community, memory information in the brain is\ncommonly believed to be stored in the synapse - a hypothesis famously\nattributed to psychologist Donald Hebb. However, there is a growing minority\nwho postulate that memory is stored inside the neuron at the molecular (RNA or\nDNA) level - an alternative postulation known as the cell-intrinsic hypothesis,\ncoined by psychologist Randy Gallistel. In this paper, we review a selection of\nkey experimental evidence from both sides of the argument. We begin with Eric\nKandel's studies on sea slugs, which provided the first evidence in support of\nthe synaptic hypothesis. Next, we touch on experiments in mice by John O'Keefe\n(declarative memory and the hippocampus) and Joseph LeDoux (procedural fear\nmemory and the amygdala). Then, we introduce the synapse as the basic building\nblock of today's artificial intelligence neural networks. After that, we\ndescribe David Glanzman's study on dissociating memory storage and synaptic\nchange in sea slugs, and Susumu Tonegawa's experiment on reactivating\nretrograde amnesia in mice using laser. From there, we highlight Germund\nHesslow's experiment on conditioned pauses in ferrets, and Beatrice Gelber's\nexperiment on conditioning in single-celled organisms without synapses\n(Paramecium aurelia). This is followed by a description of David Glanzman's\nexperiment on transplanting memory between sea slugs using RNA. Finally, we\nprovide an overview of Brian Dias and Kerry Ressler's experiment on DNA\ntransfer of fear in mice from parents to offspring.

In this paper we use an\nalgebraic approach to study the critical configurations for three projective\ncameras. We show that all critical configurations lie on the intersection of\nquadric surfaces, and classify exactly which intersections constitute a\ncritical configuration.",

    "abstract": "We consider structured optimisation problems defined in terms of the sum of a\nsmooth and convex function, and a proper, l.s.c., convex (typically non-smooth)\none in reflexive variable exponent Lebesgue spaces $L_{p(\\cdot)}(\\Omega)$. Due\nto their intrinsic space-variant properties, such spaces can be naturally used\nas solution space and combined with space-variant functionals for the solution\nof ill-posed inverse problems. For this purpose, we propose and analyse two\ninstances (primal and dual) of proximal gradient algorithms in\n$L_{p(\\cdot)}(\\Omega)$, where the proximal step, rather than depending on the\nnatural (non-separable) $L_{p(\\cdot)}(\\Omega)$ norm, is defined in terms of its\nmodular function, which, thanks to its separability, allows for the efficient\ncomputation of algorithmic iterates. Convergence in function values is proved\nfor both algorithms, with convergence rates depending on problem/space\nsmoothness. To show the effectiveness of the proposed modelling, some numerical\ntests highlighting the flexibility of the space $L_{p(\\cdot)}(\\Omega)$ are\nshown for exemplar deconvolution and mixed noise removal problems. Finally, a\nnumerical verification on the convergence speed and computational costs of both\nalgorithms in comparison with analogous ones defined in standard\n$L_{p}(\\Omega)$ spaces is presented.",

Specifically, we focus on jointly configuring the transmit\nbeamforming vectors and receive PS ratios to minimize the total transmit energy\nof the base station under the user-specific latency and energy harvesting (EH)\nrequirements. The battery depletion phenomenon is avoided by preemptively\nincorporating information regarding the receivers' battery state and EH\nfluctuations into the resource allocation design. The resulting time-average\nsum-power minimization problem is temporally correlated, non-convex (including\nmutually coupled latency-battery queue dynamics), and in general intractable.\nWe use the Lyapunov optimization framework and derive a dynamic control\nalgorithm to transform the original problem into a sequence of deterministic\nand independent subproblems, which are then solved via two alternative\napproaches: i) semidefinite relaxation combined with fractional programming,\nand ii) successive convex approximation. Furthermore, we design a\nlow-complexity closed-form iterative algorithm exploiting the\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions for a specific scenario with delay\nbounded batteryless receivers.

Motivated by the computational\nefficiency and robustness of existing large scale linear solvers, we manage to\nexpress the solution to this problem as the solution of a series of adaptive\nnon-negative least-squares problems. This gives rise to our proposed Recurrent\nLeast Squares Deconvolution Network (RLSDN) architecture, which consists of an\nimplicit layer that imposes a linear constraint between its input and output.\nBy design, our network manages to serve two important purposes simultaneously.\nThe first is that it implicitly models an effective image prior that can\nadequately characterize the set of natural images, while the second is that it\nrecovers the corresponding maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate. Experiments on\npublicly available datasets, comparing recent state-of-the-art methods, show\nthat our proposed RLSDN approach achieves the best reported performance both\nfor grayscale and color images for all tested scenarios. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a novel training strategy that can be adopted by any network\narchitecture that involves the solution of linear systems as part of its\npipeline. Our strategy eliminates completely the need to unroll the iterations\nrequired by the linear solver and, thus, it reduces significantly the memory\nfootprint during training. Consequently, this enables the training of deeper\nnetwork architectures which can further improve the reconstruction results.",

    "abstract": "The structure of complex networks can be characterized by counting and\nanalyzing network motifs. Motifs are small subgraphs that occur repeatedly in a\nnetwork, such as triangles or chains. Recent work has generalized motifs to\ntemporal and dynamic network data. However, existing techniques do not\ngeneralize to sequential or trajectory data, which represents entities moving\nthrough the nodes of a network, such as passengers moving through\ntransportation networks. The unit of observation in these data is fundamentally\ndifferent, since we analyze full observations of trajectories (e.g., a trip\nfrom airport A to airport C through airport B), rather than independent\nobservations of edges or snapshots of graphs over time. In this work, we define\nsequential motifs in trajectory data, which are small, directed, and\nedge-weighted subgraphs corresponding to patterns in observed sequences. We\ndraw a connection between counting and analysis of sequential motifs and\nHigher-Order Network (HON) models. We show that by mapping edges of a HON,\nspecifically a $k$th-order DeBruijn graph, to sequential motifs, we can count\nand evaluate their importance in observed data. We test our methodology with\ntwo datasets: (1) passengers navigating an airport network and (2) people\nnavigating the Wikipedia article network. We find that the most prevalent and\nimportant sequential motifs correspond to intuitive patterns of traversal in\nthe real systems, and show empirically that the heterogeneity of edge weights\nin an observed higher-order DeBruijn graph has implications for the\ndistributions of sequential motifs we expect to see across our null models.",

To bypass this pitfall,\nwe propose in this work to build on the thriving field of algorithm\nunfolding/unrolling. Unrolling PALM enables to leverage the data-driven\nknowledge stemming from realistic simulations or ground-truth data by learning\nboth PALM hyperparameters and variables. In contrast to most existing unrolled\nalgorithms, which assume a fixed known dictionary during the training and\ntesting phases, this article further emphasizes on the ability to deal with\nvariable mixing matrices (a.k.a. dictionaries). The proposed Learned PALM\n(LPALM) algorithm thus enables to perform semi-blind source separation, which\nis key to increase the generalization of the learnt model in real-world\napplications. We illustrate the relevance of LPALM in astrophysical\nmultispectral imaging: the algorithm not only needs up to $10^4-10^5$ times\nfewer iterations than PALM, but also improves the separation quality, while\navoiding the cumbersome hyperparameter and initialization choice of PALM.
