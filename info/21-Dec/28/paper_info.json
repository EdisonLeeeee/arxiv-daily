    "title": "Out to Explore the Cybersecurity Planet",
    "abstract": "Security ceremonies still fail despite decades of efforts by researchers and\npractitioners. Attacks are often a cunning amalgam of exploits for technical\nsystems and of forms of human behaviour. For example, this is the case with the\nrecent news headline of a large-scale attack against Electrum Bitcoin wallets,\nwhich manages to spread a malicious update of the wallet app. I therefore set\nout to look at things through a different lens. I make the (metaphorical)\nhypothesis that human ancestors arrived on Earth along with security ceremonies\nfrom a very far planet, the Cybersecurity planet. My hypothesis continues, in\nthat studying (by huge telescopes) the surface of Cybersecurity in combination\nwith the logical projection on that surface of what happens on Earth is\nbeneficial for us earthlings. I have spotted four cities so far on the remote\nplanet. Democratic City features security ceremonies that allow inhabitants to\nfollow personal paths of practice and, for example, make errors or be driven by\nemotions. By contrast, security ceremonies in Dictatorial City compel\ninhabitants to comply, thus behaving like programmed automata. Security\nceremonies in Beautiful City are so beautiful that inhabitants just love to\nfollow them precisely. Invisible City has security ceremonies that are not\nperceivable, hence inhabitants feel like they never encounter any.\nIncidentally, we use the words \"democratic\" and \"dictatorial\" without any\npolitical connotation. A key argument I shall develop is that all cities but\nDemocratic City address the human factor, albeit in different ways. In the\nlight of these findings, I will also discuss security ceremonies of our planet,\nsuch as WhatsApp web login and flight boarding, and explore room for improving\nthem based upon the current understanding of Cybersecurity.",

    "title": "Understanding and Measuring Robustness of Multimodal Learning",
    "abstract": "The modern digital world is increasingly becoming multimodal. Although\nmultimodal learning has recently revolutionized the state-of-the-art\nperformance in multimodal tasks, relatively little is known about the\nrobustness of multimodal learning in an adversarial setting. In this paper, we\nintroduce a comprehensive measurement of the adversarial robustness of\nmultimodal learning by focusing on the fusion of input modalities in multimodal\nmodels, via a framework called MUROAN (MUltimodal RObustness ANalyzer). We\nfirst present a unified view of multimodal models in MUROAN and identify the\nfusion mechanism of multimodal models as a key vulnerability. We then introduce\na new type of multimodal adversarial attacks called decoupling attack in MUROAN\nthat aims to compromise multimodal models by decoupling their fused modalities.\nWe leverage the decoupling attack of MUROAN to measure several state-of-the-art\nmultimodal models and find that the multimodal fusion mechanism in all these\nmodels is vulnerable to decoupling attacks. We especially demonstrate that, in\nthe worst case, the decoupling attack of MUROAN achieves an attack success rate\nof 100% by decoupling just 1.16% of the input space. Finally, we show that\ntraditional adversarial training is insufficient to improve the robustness of\nmultimodal models with respect to decoupling attacks. We hope our findings\nencourage researchers to pursue improving the robustness of multimodal\nlearning.",

However, the search engine results are based on\nmany features and sophisticated algorithms where search neutrality is not\nnecessarily the focal point. In this work we performed an empirical study on\ntwo popular search engines and analysed the search engine result pages for\ncontroversial topics such as abortion, medical marijuana, and gay marriage. Our\nanalysis is based on the sentiment in search results to identify their\nviewpoint as conservative or liberal.

In this paper, we investigate the challenging yet\npractical problem, Graph Few-shot Class-incremental (Graph FCL) problem, where\nthe graph model is tasked to classify both newly encountered classes and\npreviously learned classes. Towards that purpose, we put forward a Graph Pseudo\nIncremental Learning paradigm by sampling tasks recurrently from the base\nclasses, so as to produce an arbitrary number of training episodes for our\nmodel to practice the incremental learning skill. Furthermore, we design a\nHierarchical-Attention-based Graph Meta-learning framework, HAG-Meta.

This feature has recently been exploited in the context of\nmulti-scale simulations, in which the NNWs serve as surrogate model of\nmicro-scale finite element resolutions. Nevertheless, in the literature, mainly\nthe macro-stress-macro-strain response of the meso-scale boundary value problem\nwas considered and the micro-structure information could not be recovered in a\nso-called localization step. In this work, we develop Recurrent Neural Networks\n(RNNs) as surrogates of the RVE response while being able to recover the\nevolution of the local micro-structure state variables for complex loading\nscenarios. The main difficulty is the high dimensionality of the RNNs output\nwhich consists in the internal state variable distribution in the\nmicro-structure. We thus propose and compare several surrogate models based on\na dimensionality reduction: i) direct RNN modeling with implicit NNW\ndimensionality reduction, ii) RNN with PCA dimensionality reduction, and iii)\nRNN with PCA dimensionality reduction and dimensionality break down, i.e. the\nuse of several RNNs instead of a single one. Besides, we optimize the\nsequential training strategy of the latter surrogate for GPU usage in order to\nspeed up the process. Finally, through RNN modeling of the principal components\ncoefficients, the connection between the physical state variables and the\nhidden variables of the RNN is revealed, and exploited in order to select the\nhyper-parameters of the RNN-based surrogate models in their design stage.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on developing a method to obtain an uncertain linear\nfractional transformation (LFT) system that adequately captures the dynamics of\na nonlinear time-invariant system over some desired envelope. First, the\nnonlinear system is approximated as a polynomial nonlinear state-space (PNLSS)\nsystem, and a linear parameter-varying (LPV) representation of the PNLSS model\nis obtained. To reduce the potentially large number of scheduling parameters in\nthe resulting LPV system, an approach based on the cascade feedforward neural\nnetwork (CFNN) is proposed. We account for the approximation and reduction\nerrors through the addition of a norm-bounded, causal, dynamic uncertainty in\nthe LFT system. Falsification is used in a novel way to perform guided\nsimulations for deriving a norm bound on the dynamic uncertainty and generating\ndata for training the CFNN. Then, robustness analysis using integral quadratic\nconstraint theory is carried out to choose an LFT representation that leads to\na computationally tractable analysis problem and useful analysis results.\nFinally, the proposed approach is used to obtain an LFT representation for the\nnonlinear equations of motion of a fixed-wing unmanned aircraft system.",

Sophisticated scene\nunderstanding would require estimating human pose and shape as well as\ngestures, towards representations that ultimately combine useful metric and\nbehavioral signals with free-viewpoint photo-realistic visualisation\ncapabilities. To sustain progress, we build a large-scale photo-realistic\ndataset, Human-SPACE (HSPACE), of animated humans placed in complex synthetic\nindoor and outdoor environments. We combine a hundred diverse individuals of\nvarying ages, gender, proportions, and ethnicity, with hundreds of motions and\nscenes, as well as parametric variations in body shape (for a total of 1,600\ndifferent humans), in order to generate an initial dataset of over 1 million\nframes. Human animations are obtained by fitting an expressive human body\nmodel, GHUM, to single scans of people, followed by novel re-targeting and\npositioning procedures that support the realistic animation of dressed humans,\nstatistical variation of body proportions, and jointly consistent scene\nplacement of multiple moving people. Assets are generated automatically, at\nscale, and are compatible with existing real time rendering and game engines.\nThe dataset with evaluation server will be made available for research. Our\nlarge-scale analysis of the impact of synthetic data, in connection with real\ndata and weak supervision, underlines the considerable potential for continuing\nquality improvements and limiting the sim-to-real gap, in this practical\nsetting, in connection with increased model capacity.",

This is undesirable for many reason-ing tasks in real-world scenarios,\nwhere short paths connecting the source and target entities are not available\nin incomplete KGs, and thus the reasoning performances drop drastically unless\nthe agent is able to seek out more clues from longer paths. To address the\nabove challenge, in this paper, we propose a dual-agent reinforcement learning\nframework, which trains two agents (GIANT and DWARF) to walk over a KG jointly\nand search for the answer collaboratively. Our approach tackles the reasoning\nchallenge in long paths by assigning one of the agents (GIANT) searching on\ncluster-level paths quickly and providing stage-wise hints for another agent\n(DWARF).

The key assumption is that users learn to\nassociate promising motor actions to percepts via experience when reinforcement\nsignals (success/failure) are present. They also learn to categorize actions\n(e.g., ``rotating'' a dial), giving them the ability to name and reason about\naffordance. Upon encountering novel widgets, their ability to generalize these\nactions determines their ability to perceive affordances. We implement this\ntheory in a virtual robot model, which demonstrates human-like adaptation of\naffordance in interactive widgets tasks.

The cause of the exponential number of comparisons in $h$ is that\nthe decision tree training algorithm is based on the divide-and-conquer\nparadigm, where dummy rows are added after each split in order to hide the\nnumber of rows in the dataset. We resolve this issue via secure data structure\nthat enables us to compute an aggregate value for every group while hiding the\ngrouping information.

Existing learning based methods highly depend on weak supervision\nsignals, e.g. 2D and 3D joint location, due to the lack of in-the-wild paired\n3D supervision. However, considering the 2D-to-3D ambiguities existed in these\nweak supervision labels, the network is easy to get stuck in local optima when\ntrained with such labels. In this paper, we reduce the ambituity by optimizing\nmultiple initializations. Specifically, we propose a three-stage framework\nnamed Multi-Initialization Optimization Network (MION). In the first stage, we\nstrategically select different coarse 3D reconstruction candidates which are\ncompatible with the 2D keypoints of input sample. Each coarse reconstruction\ncan be regarded as an initialization leads to one optimization branch. In the\nsecond stage, we design a mesh refinement transformer (MRT) to respectively\nrefine each coarse reconstruction result via a self-attention mechanism.\nFinally, a Consistency Estimation Network (CEN) is proposed to find the best\nresult from mutiple candidates by evaluating if the visual evidence in RGB\nimage matches a given 3D reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our\nMulti-Initialization Optimization Network outperforms existing 3D mesh based\nmethods on multiple public benchmarks.",

Excellent results\nare known in the secretary setting, where the columns are adversarially chosen,\nbut presented in a uniformly random order. However, these existing algorithms\nare susceptible to adversarial attacks: they try to \"learn\" characteristics of\na good solution, but tend to over-fit to the model, and hence a small number of\nadversarial corruptions can cause the algorithm to fail.\nIn this paper, we give the first robust algorithms for Packing Integer\nPrograms, specifically in the recently proposed Byzantine Secretary framework.\nOur techniques are based on a two-level use of online learning, to robustly\nlearn an approximation to the optimal value, and then to use this robust\nestimate to pick a good solution. These techniques are general and we use them\nto design robust algorithms for PIPs in the prophet model as well, specifically\nin the Prophet-with-Augmentations framework.

A number of\nmethods for this task are always based on voxelized scene representations for\nkeeping local scene structure. However, due to the existence of visible empty\nvoxels, these methods always suffer from heavy computation redundancy when the\nnetwork goes deeper, and thus limit the completion quality. To address this\ndilemma, we propose our novel point-voxel aggregation network for this task.\nFirstly, we transfer the voxelized scenes to point clouds by removing these\nvisible empty voxels and adopt a deep point stream to capture semantic\ninformation from the scene efficiently. Meanwhile, a light-weight voxel stream\ncontaining only two 3D convolution layers preserves local structures of the\nvoxelized scenes. Furthermore, we design an anisotropic voxel aggregation\noperator to fuse the structure details from the voxel stream into the point\nstream, and a semantic-aware propagation module to enhance the up-sampling\nprocess in the point stream by semantic labels.

EHR data, represented as a\nthree-dimensional analogue of a matrix (tensor), is decomposed into\ntwo-dimensional factors that can be interpreted as computational phenotypes.\nMethods: We apply constrained tensor factorization to derive computational\nphenotypes and predict mortality in cohorts of patients with breast, prostate,\ncolorectal, or lung cancer in the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data\nWarehouse from 2000 to 2015. In our experiments, we examined using a supervised\nterm in the factorization algorithm, filtering tensor co-occurrences by medical\nindication, and incorporating additional social determinants of health (SDOH)\ncovariates in the factorization process. We evaluated the resulting\ncomputational phenotypes qualitatively and by assessing their ability to\npredict five-year mortality using the area under the curve (AUC) statistic.\nResults: Filtering by medical indication led to more concise and interpretable\nphenotypes. Mortality prediction performance (AUC) varied under the different\nexperimental conditions and by cancer type (breast: 0.623 - 0.694, prostate:\n0.603 - 0.750, colorectal: 0.523 - 0.641, and lung: 0.517 - 0.623). Generally,\nprediction performance improved with the use of a supervised term and the\nincorporation of SDOH covariates. Conclusion: Constrained tensor factorization,\napplied to sparse EHR data of patients with cancer, can discover computational\nphenotypes predictive of five-year mortality. The incorporation of SDOH\nvariables into the factorization algorithm is an easy-to-implement and\neffective way to improve prediction performance.",

As models continue to scale up\nin parameters, training data, and compute, understanding memorization in\nlanguage models is both important from a learning-theoretical point of view,\nand is practically crucial in real world applications. An open question in\nprevious studies of memorization in language models is how to filter out\n\"common\" memorization. In fact, most memorization criteria strongly correlate\nwith the number of occurrences in the training set, capturing \"common\"\nmemorization such as familiar phrases, public knowledge or templated texts. In\nthis paper, we provide a principled perspective inspired by a taxonomy of human\nmemory in Psychology. From this perspective, we formulate a notion of\ncounterfactual memorization, which characterizes how a model's predictions\nchange if a particular document is omitted during training. We identify and\nstudy counterfactually-memorized training examples in standard text datasets.\nWe further estimate the influence of each training example on the validation\nset and on generated texts, and show that this can provide direct evidence of\nthe source of memorization at test time.",

Most previous works adopt a\nbottom-up two-stage or a point-based one-stage approach, which often suffers\nfrom overhead time complexity or sub-optimal design assumption. In this work,\nwe propose a novel SGG method to address the aforementioned issues, which\nformulates the task as a bipartite graph construction problem. To solve the\nproblem, we develop a transformer-based end-to-end framework that first\ngenerates the entity and predicate proposal set, followed by inferring directed\nedges to form the relation triplets. In particular, we develop a new\nentity-aware predicate representation based on a structural predicate generator\nto leverage the compositional property of relationships. Moreover, we design a\ngraph assembling module to infer the connectivity of the bipartite scene graph\nbased on our entity-aware structure, enabling us to generate the scene graph in\nan end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results show that our design is\nable to achieve the state-of-the-art or comparable performance on two\nchallenging benchmarks, surpassing most of the existing approaches and enjoying\nhigher efficiency in inference.

This remaining information\nintroduces a domain-specific bias, weakening the generalization performance. In\nthis work, we propose splitting the information into a task-related\nrepresentation and its complementary context representation. We propose an\noriginal method, combining adversarial feature predictors and cyclic\nreconstruction, to disentangle these two representations in the single-domain\nsupervised case. We then adapt this method to the unsupervised domain\nadaptation problem, consisting of training a model capable of performing on\nboth a source and a target domain. In particular, our method promotes\ndisentanglement in the target domain, despite the absence of training labels.\nThis enables the isolation of task-specific information from both domains and a\nprojection into a common representation. The task-specific representation\nallows efficient transfer of knowledge acquired from the source domain to the\ntarget domain. In the single-domain case, we demonstrate the quality of our\nrepresentations on information retrieval tasks and the generalization benefits\ninduced by sharpened task-specific representations.

Commodity devices cooperate in providing\nthe unmodulated carrier that the battery-free nodes need to communicate while\ncollecting energy from their environment to perform sensing, computation, and\ncommunication tasks. The optimal provision of the unmodulated carrier limits\nthe size of the network because it is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization\nproblem.

We show that importance weighting fails not because of the\noverparameterization, but instead, as a result of using exponentially-tailed\nlosses like the logistic or cross-entropy loss. As a remedy, we show that\npolynomially-tailed losses restore the effects of importance reweighting in\ncorrecting distribution shift in overparameterized models. We characterize the\nbehavior of gradient descent on importance weighted polynomially-tailed losses\nwith overparameterized linear models, and theoretically demonstrate the\nadvantage of using polynomially-tailed losses in a label shift setting.\nSurprisingly, our theory shows that using weights that are obtained by\nexponentiating the classical unbiased importance weights can improve\nperformance.

We trained the\nparameters of a relatively small convolutional neural network (CNN) as follows:\nFirst, we randomly mutated the CNN weights.

Given an ML task on\nprivacy-sensitive data, DP-UTIL enables a ML privacy practitioner perform\nholistic comparative analysis on the impact of DP in these five perturbation\nspots, measured in terms of model utility loss, privacy leakage, and the number\nof truly revealed training samples. We evaluate DP-UTIL over classification\ntasks on vision, medical, and financial datasets, using two representative\nlearning algorithms (logistic regression and deep neural network) against\nmembership inference attack as a case study attack. One of the highlights of\nour results is that prediction perturbation consistently achieves the lowest\nutility loss on all models across all datasets.

In this paper, we investigate the minimum mean square\nerror (MMSE) estimation of effective channel coefficients in cell-free massive\nMIMO systems with massive connectivity. To facilitate the theoretical analysis,\nonly single measurement vector (SMV) based MMSE estimation is considered in\nthis paper, i.e., the MMSE estimation is performed based on the received pilot\nsignals at each AP separately. Inspired by the decoupling principle of replica\nsymmetric postulated MMSE estimation of sparse signal vectors with independent\nand identically distributed (i.i.d.) non-zero components, we develop the\ncorresponding decoupling principle for the SMV based MMSE estimation of sparse\nsignal vectors with independent and non-identically distributed (i.n.i.d.)\nnon-zero components, which plays a key role in the theoretical analysis of SMV\nbased MMSE estimation of the effective channel coefficients in cell-free\nmassive MIMO systems with massive connectivity. Subsequently, based on the\nobtained decoupling principle of MMSE estimation, likelihood ratio test and the\noptimal fusion rule, we perform user activity detection based on the received\npilot signals at only one AP, or cooperation among the entire set of APs for\ncentralized or distributed detection.

State and velocity noise of both the robot and\nobstacles as well as the robot's control noise are modelled as non-parametric\ndistributions as often the Gaussian assumptions of noise models are violated in\nreal-world scenarios. Under these assumptions, we formulate a robust MPC that\nsamples robotic controls effectively in a manner that aligns the robot to the\ngoal state while avoiding obstacles under the duress of such non-parametric\nnoise. In particular, the MPC incorporates a distribution matching cost that\neffectively aligns the distribution of the current collision cone to a certain\ndesired distribution whose samples are collision-free. This cost is posed as a\ndistance function in the Hilbert Space, whose minimization typically results in\nthe collision cone samples becoming collision-free. We compare and show\ntangible performance gain with methods that model the collision cone\ndistribution by linearizing the Gaussian approximations of the original\nnon-parametric state and obstacle distributions. We also show superior\nperformance with methods that pose a chance constraint formulation of the\nGaussian approximations of non-parametric noise without subjecting such\napproximations to further linearizations.

At the beginning, Hawkes process and its\nvariants which can simulate simultaneously the self-triggering and mutual\ntriggering patterns between different events in complex sequences in a clear\nand quantitative way are more popular.Later on, with the advances of neural\nnetwork, neural Hawkes process has been proposed one after another, and\ngradually become a research hotspot. The proposal of the transformer Hawkes\nprocess (THP) has gained a huge performance improvement, so a new upsurge of\nthe neural Hawkes process based on transformer is set off. However, THP does\nnot make full use of the information of occurrence time and type of event in\nthe asynchronous event sequence. It simply adds the encoding of event type\nconversion and the location encoding of time conversion to the source encoding.\nAt the same time, the learner built from a single transformer will result in an\ninescapable learning bias. In order to mitigate these problems, we propose a\ntri-transformer Hawkes process (Tri-THP) model, in which the event and time\ninformation are added to the dot-product attention as auxiliary information to\nform a new multihead attention. The effectiveness of the Tri-THP is proved by a\nseries of well-designed experiments on both real world and synthetic data.",

Based on it, we propose\nneuron-level inverse perturbation(NIP), the first neuron-level reactive defense\nmethod against adversarial attacks. By strengthening front neurons and\nweakening those in the tail part, NIP can eliminate nearly all adversarial\nperturbations while still maintaining high benign accuracy. Besides, it can\ncope with different sizes of perturbations via adaptivity, especially larger\nones. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three datasets and six models show\nthat NIP outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines against eleven adversarial\nattacks. We further provide interpretable proofs via neuron activation and\nvisualization for better understanding.",

    "abstract": "The success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in real-world applications has\nbenefited from abundant pre-trained models. However, the backdoored pre-trained\nmodels can pose a significant trojan threat to the deployment of downstream\nDNNs. Existing DNN testing methods are mainly designed to find incorrect corner\ncase behaviors in adversarial settings but fail to discover the backdoors\ncrafted by strong trojan attacks. Observing the trojan network behaviors shows\nthat they are not just reflected by a single compromised neuron as proposed by\nprevious work but attributed to the critical neural paths in the activation\nintensity and frequency of multiple neurons. This work formulates the DNN\nbackdoor testing and proposes the CatchBackdoor framework. Via differential\nfuzzing of critical neurons from a small number of benign examples, we identify\nthe trojan paths and particularly the critical ones, and generate backdoor\ntesting examples by simulating the critical neurons in the identified paths.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CatchBackdoor, with higher\ndetection performance than existing methods. CatchBackdoor works better on\ndetecting backdoors by stealthy blending and adaptive attacks, which existing\nmethods fail to detect. Moreover, our experiments show that CatchBackdoor may\nreveal the potential backdoors of models in Model Zoo.",

    "abstract": "Efficient and adaptive computer vision systems have been proposed to make\ncomputer vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection,\noptimized for embedded or mobile devices. These solutions, quite recent in\ntheir origin, focus on optimizing the model (a deep neural network, DNN) or the\nsystem by designing an adaptive system with approximation knobs. In spite of\nseveral recent efforts, we show that existing solutions suffer from two major\ndrawbacks. First, the system does not consider energy consumption of the models\nwhile making a decision on which model to run. Second, the evaluation does not\nconsider the practical scenario of contention on the device, due to other\nco-resident workloads. In this work, we propose an efficient and adaptive video\nobject detection system, Virtuoso, which is jointly optimized for accuracy,\nenergy efficiency, and latency. Underlying Virtuoso is a multi-branch execution\nkernel that is capable of running at different operating points in the\naccuracy-energy-latency axes, and a lightweight runtime scheduler to select the\nbest fit execution branch to satisfy the user requirement. To fairly compare\nwith Virtuoso, we benchmark 15 state-of-the-art or widely used protocols,\nincluding Faster R-CNN (FRCNN), YOLO v3, SSD, EfficientDet, SELSA, MEGA, REPP,\nFastAdapt, and our in-house adaptive variants of FRCNN+, YOLO+, SSD+, and\nEfficientDet+ (our variants have enhanced efficiency for mobiles). With this\ncomprehensive benchmark, Virtuoso has shown superiority to all the above\nprotocols, leading the accuracy frontier at every efficiency level on NVIDIA\nJetson mobile GPUs. Specifically, Virtuoso has achieved an accuracy of 63.9%,\nwhich is more than 10% higher than some of the popular object detection models,\nFRCNN at 51.1%, and YOLO at 49.5%.",

The objective of the project is to build a\nsemantic approach to extract and automatically process information related to\nthe requirements contained in the standard. To this end, the project has been\ndivided into three parts, covering the analysis of the requirements document,\nthe extraction of relevant information and creation of the ontology and the\ncomparison with other approaches. The first part of our work deals with the\nanalysis of the requirements document under study. The study focuses on the\nspecificity of the sentence structure, the use of particular words and\nvocabulary related to the representation of the requirements. The aim is to\npropose a representation facilitating the extraction of information, used in\nthe second part of the study. In the second part, the extraction of relevant\ninformation is conducted in two ways: manual (the ontology being built by\nhand), semi-automatic (using semantic annotation software and natural language\nprocessing techniques). Whatever the method used, the aim of this extraction is\nto create the concept dictionary, then the ontology, enriched as the document\nis scanned and understood by the system. Once the relevant terms have been\nidentified, the work focuses on identifying and representing the requirements,\nseparating the textual writing from the information given in the tables.

First, under the assumption of known system dynamics, we\nobtain the theoretically optimal performance bound by formulating the admission\ncontrol problem as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and\nsolving it through dynamic programming. Second, we apply reinforcement learning\nto practically tackle the problem when the arrival and departure rates are not\nknown. As Q-learning maximizes the discounted rewards, we prove it is not an\nefficient solution due to its sensitivity to the discount factor. Then, we\npropose the average reward reinforcement learning approach (R-Learning) to find\nthe policy that directly maximizes the average profit. Finally, we evaluate\ndifferent solutions through extensive simulations and experimentally using the\n5Growth platform. Results confirm that the proposed R-Learning solution always\noutperforms Q-Learning and the greedy policies.

    "abstract": "Due to the communication bottleneck in distributed and federated learning\napplications, algorithms using communication compression have attracted\nsignificant attention and are widely used in practice. Moreover, there exists\nclient-variance in federated learning due to the total number of heterogeneous\nclients is usually very large and the server is unable to communicate with all\nclients in each communication round. In this paper, we address these two issues\ntogether by proposing compressed and client-variance reduced methods.\nConcretely, we introduce COFIG and FRECON, which successfully enjoy\ncommunication compression with client-variance reduction. The total\ncommunication round of COFIG is\n$O(\\frac{(1+\\omega)^{3/2}\\sqrt{N}}{S\\epsilon^2}+\\frac{(1+\\omega)N^{2/3}}{S\\epsilon^2})$\nin the nonconvex setting, where $N$ is the total number of clients, $S$ is the\nnumber of communicated clients in each round, $\\epsilon$ is the convergence\nerror, and $\\omega$ is the parameter for the compression operator. Besides, our\nFRECON can converge faster than COFIG in the nonconvex setting, and it\nconverges with $O(\\frac{(1+\\omega)\\sqrt{N}}{S\\epsilon^2})$ communication\nrounds. In the convex setting, COFIG converges within the communication rounds\n$O(\\frac{(1+\\omega)\\sqrt{N}}{S\\epsilon})$, which is also the first convergence\nresult for compression schemes that do not communicate with all the clients in\neach round. In sum, both COFIG and FRECON do not need to communicate with all\nthe clients and provide first/faster convergence results for convex and\nnonconvex federated learning, while previous works either require full clients\ncommunication (thus not practical) or obtain worse convergence results.",

This raises important\nquestions about when and how meta-learning algorithms should be deployed. In\nthis paper, we make a first step in clarifying these questions by first\nformulating a computable metric for a few-shot learning benchmark that we\nhypothesize is predictive of whether meta-learning solutions will succeed or\nnot. We name this metric the diversity coefficient of a few-shot learning\nbenchmark. Using the diversity coefficient, we show that the MiniImagenet\nbenchmark has zero diversity - according to twenty-four different ways to\ncompute the diversity. We proceed to show that when making a fair comparison\nbetween MAML learned solutions to transfer learning, both have identical\nmeta-test accuracy. This suggests that transfer learning fails to outperform\nMAML - contrary to what previous work suggests. Together, these two facts\nprovide the first test of whether diversity correlates with meta-learning\nsuccess and therefore show that a diversity coefficient of zero correlates with\na high similarity between transfer learning and MAML learned solutions -\nespecially at meta-test time. We therefore conjecture meta-learned solutions\nhave the same meta-test performance as transfer learning when the diversity\ncoefficient is zero.",

In particular, we identify three\ninteresting properties: 1) In contrast to previous work, we show that it is\npossible to define a family of synthetic benchmarks that result in a low degree\nof feature re-use - suggesting that current few-shot learning benchmarks might\nnot have the properties needed for the success of meta-learning algorithms; 2)\nmeta-overfitting occurs when the number of classes (or concepts) are finite,\nand this issue disappears once the task has an unbounded number of concepts\n(e.g., online learning); 3) more adaptation at meta-test time with MAML does\nnot necessarily result in a significant representation change or even an\nimprovement in meta-test performance - even when training on our proposed\nsynthetic benchmarks. Finally, we suggest that to understand meta-learning\nalgorithms better, we must go beyond tracking only absolute performance and, in\naddition, formally quantify the degree of meta-learning and track both metrics\ntogether. Reporting results in future work this way will help us identify the\nsources of meta-overfitting more accurately and help us design more flexible\nmeta-learning algorithms that learn beyond fixed feature re-use. Finally, we\nconjecture the core challenge of re-thinking meta-learning is in the design of\nfew-shot learning data sets and benchmarks - rather than in the algorithms, as\nsuggested by previous work.",

Subgraph edit distance (SED) is one of the most expressive measures for\nsubgraph similarity.

Towards that end, we design a\nnovel siamese graph neural network called NEUROSED, which learns an embedding\nspace with a rich structure reminiscent of SED. With the help of a specially\ncrafted inductive bias, NEUROSED not only enables high accuracy but also\nensures that the predicted SED, like true SED, satisfies triangle inequality.\nThe design is generic enough to also model graph edit distance (GED), while\nensuring that the predicted GED space is metric, like the true GED space.\nExtensive experiments on real graph datasets, for both SED and GED, establish\nthat NEUROSED achieves approximately 2 times lower RMSE than the state of the\nart and is approximately 18 times faster than the fastest baseline.

    "abstract": "The Discrete Periodic Radon Transform (DPRT) has been extensively used in\napplications that involve image reconstructions from projections. This\nmanuscript introduces a fast and scalable approach for computing the forward\nand inverse DPRT that is based on the use of: (i) a parallel array of\nfixed-point adder trees, (ii) circular shift registers to remove the need for\naccessing external memory components when selecting the input data for the\nadder trees, (iii) an image block-based approach to DPRT computation that can\nfit the proposed architecture to available resources, and (iv) fast\ntranspositions that are computed in one or a few clock cycles that do not\ndepend on the size of the input image. As a result, for an $N\\times N$ image\n($N$ prime), the proposed approach can compute up to $N^{2}$ additions per\nclock cycle. Compared to previous approaches, the scalable approach provides\nthe fastest known implementations for different amounts of computational\nresources. For example, for a $251\\times 251$ image, for approximately $25\\%$\nfewer flip-flops than required for a systolic implementation, we have that the\nscalable DPRT is computed 36 times faster. For the fastest case, we introduce\noptimized architectures that can compute the DPRT and its inverse in just\n$2N+\\left\\lceil \\log_{2}N\\right\\rceil+1$ and $2N+3\\left\\lceil\n\\log_{2}N\\right\\rceil+B+2$ cycles respectively, where $B$ is the number of bits\nused to represent each input pixel. On the other hand, the scalable DPRT\napproach requires more 1-bit additions than for the systolic implementation and\nprovides a trade-off between speed and additional 1-bit additions. All of the\nproposed DPRT architectures were implemented in VHDL and validated using an\nFPGA implementation.",

Bone conduction microphones\n(BCM) are robust against ambient noises but suffer from limited effective\nbandwidth due to their sensing mechanism. Although existing audio super\nresolution algorithms can recover the high frequency loss to achieve\nhigh-fidelity audio, they require considerably more computational resources\nthan available in low-power hearable devices. This paper proposes the\nfirst-ever real-time on-chip speech audio super resolution system for BCM. To\naccomplish this, we built and compared a series of lightweight audio super\nresolution deep learning models. Among all these models, ATS-UNet is the most\ncost-efficient because the proposed novel Audio Temporal Shift Module (ATSM)\nreduces the network's dimensionality while maintaining sufficient temporal\nfeatures from speech audios. Then we quantized and deployed the ATS-UNet to\nlow-end ARM micro-controller units for real-time embedded prototypes.\nEvaluation results show that our system achieved real-time inference speed on\nCortex-M7 and higher quality than the baseline audio super resolution method.\nFinally, we conducted a user study with ten experts and ten amateur listeners\nto evaluate our method's effectiveness to human ears.

In addition, the paper\nintroduces a semantic prior based random search for the opposite labels to\nensure the smooth distribution of the clustering and the robustness of the\nclassifiers.

False data injection attacks (FDIAs),\nspecifically, represent a major class of cyber threats to smart grids by\ntargeting the measurement data's integrity. Although various solutions have\nbeen proposed to detect those cyberattacks, the vast majority of the works have\nignored the inherent graph structure of the power grid measurements and\nvalidated their detectors only for small test systems with less than a few\nhundred buses. To better exploit the spatial correlations of smart grid\nmeasurements, this paper proposes a deep learning model for cyberattack\ndetection in large-scale AC power grids using Chebyshev Graph Convolutional\nNetworks (CGCN). By reducing the complexity of spectral graph filters and\nmaking them localized, CGCN provides a fast and efficient convolution operation\nto model the graph structural smart grid data. We numerically verify that the\nproposed CGCN based detector surpasses the state-of-the-art model by 7.86 in\ndetection rate and 9.67 in false alarm rate for a large-scale power grid with\n2848 buses.

    "abstract": "Waves of misery is a phenomenon where spikes of many node splits occur over\nshort periods of time in tree indexes. Waves of misery negatively affect the\nperformance of tree indexes in insertion-heavy workloads.Waves of misery have\nbeen first observed in the context of the B-tree, where these waves cause\nunpredictable index performance. In particular, the performance of search and\nindex-update operations deteriorate when a wave of misery takes place, but is\nmore predictable between the waves. This paper investigates the presence or\nlack of waves of misery in several R-tree variants, and studies the extent of\nwhich these waves impact the performance of each variant. Interestingly,\nalthough having poorer query performance, the Linear and Quadratic R-trees are\nfound to be more resilient to waves of misery than both the Hilbert and\nR*-trees. This paper presents several techniques to reduce the impact in\nperformance of the waves of misery for the Hilbert and R*-trees. One way to\neliminate waves of misery is to force node splits to take place at regular\ntimes before nodes become full to achieve deterministic performance. The other\nway is that upon splitting a node, do not split it evenly but rather at\ndifferent node utilization factors. This allows leaf nodes not to fill at the\nsame pace. We study the impact of two new techniques to mitigate waves of\nmisery after the tree index has been constructed, namely Regular Elective\nSplits (RES, for short) and Unequal Random Splits (URS, for short). Our\nexperimental investigation highlights the trade-offs in performance of the\nintroduced techniques and the pros and cons of each technique.",

The attack graph\ncontains one destination node and multiple entry nodes. The attacker's entry\nnode is chosen by nature. The defender chooses to block a set of edges limited\nby his budget. The attacker then picks the shortest unblocked attack path. The\ndefender aims to maximize the expected shortest path length for the attacker,\nwhere the expectation is taken over entry nodes.\nWe observe that practical Active Directory attack graphs have small maximum\nattack path lengths and are structurally close to trees. We first show that\neven if the maximum attack path length is a constant, the problem is still\n$W[1]$-hard with respect to the defender's budget. Having a small maximum\nattack path length and a small budget is not enough to design fixed-parameter\nalgorithms. If we further assume that the number of entry nodes is small, then\nwe derive a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm.\nWe then propose two other fixed-parameter algorithms by exploiting the\ntree-like features. One is based on tree decomposition and requires a small\ntree width. The other assumes a small number of splitting nodes (nodes with\nmultiple out-going edges). Finally, the last algorithm is converted into a\ngraph convolutional neural network based heuristic, which scales to larger\ngraphs with more splitting nodes.",

Although deep learning with differential privacy is a defacto\nstandard for publishing deep learning models with differential privacy\nguarantee, we show that differentially private algorithms with fixed privacy\nparameters are vulnerable against gradient leakage attacks. This paper\ninvestigates alternative approaches to gradient leakage resilient deep learning\nwith differential privacy (DP). First, we analyze existing implementation of\ndeep learning with differential privacy, which use fixed noise variance to\ninjects constant noise to the gradients in all layers using fixed privacy\nparameters. Despite the DP guarantee provided, the method suffers from low\naccuracy and is vulnerable to gradient leakage attacks. Second, we present a\ngradient leakage resilient deep learning approach with differential privacy\nguarantee by using dynamic privacy parameters. Unlike fixed-parameter\nstrategies that result in constant noise variance, different dynamic parameter\nstrategies present alternative techniques to introduce adaptive noise variance\nand adaptive noise injection which are closely aligned to the trend of gradient\nupdates during differentially private model training.

However, it is unclear whether those\nmethods which exploit such dependency information for semantic parsing can be\ncombined to achieve further improvement and the relationship of those methods\nwhen they combine. In this paper, we examine three methods to incorporate such\ndependency information in a Transformer based semantic parser and empirically\nstudy their combinations. We first replace standard self-attention heads in the\nencoder with parent-scaled self-attention (PASCAL) heads, i.e., the ones that\ncan attend to the dependency parent of each token. Then we concatenate\nsyntax-aware word representations (SAWRs), i.e., the intermediate hidden\nrepresentations of a neural dependency parser, with ordinary word embedding to\nenhance the encoder. Later, we insert the constituent attention (CA) module to\nthe encoder, which adds an extra constraint to attention heads that can better\ncapture the inherent dependency structure of input sentences. Transductive\nensemble learning (TEL) is used for model aggregation, and an ablation study is\nconducted to show the contribution of each method.

MTL is to determine the locations of potential multiple transmitters in\na field, based on readings from a distributed set of sensors. In contrast to\nthe widely studied single transmitter localization problem, the MTL problem has\nonly been studied recently in a few works. MTL is of great significance in many\napplications wherein intruders may be present. E.g., in shared spectrum\nsystems, detection of unauthorized transmitters and estimating their power are\nimperative to efficient utilization of the shared spectrum.\nIn this paper, we present DeepMTL, a novel deep-learning approach to address\nthe MTL problem. In particular, we frame MTL as a sequence of two steps, each\nof which is a computer vision problem: image-to-image translation and object\ndetection. The first step of image-to-image translation essentially maps an\ninput image representing sensor readings to an image representing the\ndistribution of transmitter locations, and the second object detection step\nderives precise locations of transmitters from the image of transmitter\ndistributions. For the first step, we design our learning model Sen2Peak, while\nfor the second step, we customize a state-of-the-art object detection model\nYolo-cust. Using DeepMTL as a building block, we also develop techniques to\nestimate transmit power of the localized transmitters.

An aim of this paper is to propose a deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL)-based approach to achieve a reduction of energy consumption in UDN.

    "abstract": "Session-based recommendation aims to predict a user's next action based on\nprevious actions in the current session. The major challenge is to capture\nauthentic and complete user preferences in the entire session. Recent work\nutilizes graph structure to represent the entire session and adopts Graph\nNeural Network to encode session information. This modeling choice has been\nproved to be effective and achieved remarkable results. However, most of the\nexisting studies only consider each item within the session independently and\ndo not capture session semantics from a high-level perspective. Such limitation\noften leads to severe information loss and increases the difficulty of\ncapturing long-range dependencies within a session. Intuitively, compared with\nindividual items, a session snippet, i.e., a group of locally consecutive\nitems, is able to provide supplemental user intents which are hardly captured\nby existing methods. In this work, we propose to learn multi-granularity\nconsecutive user intent unit to improve the recommendation performance.\nSpecifically, we creatively propose Multi-granularity Intent Heterogeneous\nSession Graph which captures the interactions between different granularity\nintent units and relieves the burden of long-dependency. Moreover, we propose\nthe Intent Fusion Ranking module to compose the recommendation results from\nvarious granularity user intents. Compared with current methods that only\nleverage intents from individual items, IFR benefits from different granularity\nuser intents to generate more accurate and comprehensive session\nrepresentation, thus eventually boosting recommendation performance.

However, it raises a social concern whether DNNs can produce reliable\nand fair decisions especially when they are applied to sensitive domains\ninvolving valuable resource allocation, such as education, loan, and\nemployment. It is crucial to conduct fairness testing before DNNs are reliably\ndeployed to such sensitive domains, i.e., generating as many instances as\npossible to uncover fairness violations. However, the existing testing methods\nare still limited from three aspects: interpretability, performance, and\ngeneralizability. To overcome the challenges, we propose NeuronFair, a new DNN\nfairness testing framework that differs from previous work in several key\naspects: (1) interpretable - it quantitatively interprets DNNs' fairness\nviolations for the biased decision; (2) effective - it uses the interpretation\nresults to guide the generation of more diverse instances in less time; (3)\ngeneric - it can handle both structured and unstructured data. Extensive\nevaluations across 7 datasets and the corresponding DNNs demonstrate\nNeuronFair's superior performance. For instance, on structured datasets, it\ngenerates much more instances (~x5.84) and saves more time (with an average\nspeedup of 534.56%) compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "A tenet of open source software development is to accept contributions from\nusers-developers (typically after appropriate vetting). But should this include\ninterventions done as part of research on open source development? Following an\nincident in which buggy code was submitted to the Linux kernel to see whether\nit would be caught, we conduct a survey among open source developers and\nempirical software engineering researchers to see what behaviors they think are\nacceptable. This covers two main issues: the use of publicly accessible\ninformation, and conducting active experimentation. The survey had 224\nrespondents. The results indicate that open-source developers are largely open\nto research, provided it is done transparently. In other words, many would\nagree to experiments on open-source projects if the subjects were notified and\nprovided informed consent, and in special cases also if only the project\nleaders agree. While researchers generally hold similar opinions, they\nsometimes fail to appreciate certain nuances in the stand of developers.\nExamples include observing license restrictions on publishing open-source code\nand safeguarding the code. Conversely, researchers seem to be more concerned\nthan developers about privacy issues. Based on these results, it is recommended\nthat open source repositories and projects include research considerations in\ntheir access guidelines, and that researchers take care to ask permission also\nwhen not formally required to do so. We note too that the open source community\nwants to be heard, so professional societies and IRBs should consult with them\nwhen formulating ethics codes.",

    "abstract": "With the wide penetration of smart robots in multifarious fields,\nSimultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technique in robotics has\nattracted growing attention in the community. Yet collaborating SLAM over\nmultiple robots still remains challenging due to performance contradiction\nbetween the intensive graphics computation of SLAM and the limited computing\ncapability of robots. While traditional solutions resort to the powerful cloud\nservers acting as an external computation provider, we show by real-world\nmeasurements that the significant communication overhead in data offloading\nprevents its practicability to real deployment. To tackle these challenges,\nthis paper promotes the emerging edge computing paradigm into multi-robot SLAM\nand proposes RecSLAM, a multi-robot laser SLAM system that focuses on\naccelerating map construction process under the robot-edge-cloud architecture.\nIn contrast to conventional multi-robot SLAM that generates graphic maps on\nrobots and completely merges them on the cloud, RecSLAM develops a hierarchical\nmap fusion technique that directs robots' raw data to edge servers for\nreal-time fusion and then sends to the cloud for global merging. To optimize\nthe overall pipeline, an efficient multi-robot SLAM collaborative processing\nframework is introduced to adaptively optimize robot-to-edge offloading\ntailored to heterogeneous edge resource conditions, meanwhile ensuring the\nworkload balancing among the edge servers. Extensive evaluations show RecSLAM\ncan achieve up to 39% processing latency reduction over the state-of-the-art.\nBesides, a proof-of-concept prototype is developed and deployed in real scenes\nto demonstrate its effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Acronyms and long-forms are commonly found in research documents, more so in\ndocuments from scientific and legal domains. Many acronyms used in such\ndocuments are domain-specific and are very rarely found in normal text corpora.\nOwing to this, transformer-based NLP models often detect OOV (Out of\nVocabulary) for acronym tokens, especially for non-English languages, and their\nperformance suffers while linking acronyms to their long forms during\nextraction. Moreover, pretrained transformer models like BERT are not\nspecialized to handle scientific and legal documents. With these points being\nthe overarching motivation behind this work, we propose a novel framework\nCABACE: Character-Aware BERT for ACronym Extraction, which takes into account\ncharacter sequences in text and is adapted to scientific and legal domains by\nmasked language modelling. We further use an objective with an augmented loss\nfunction, adding the max loss and mask loss terms to the standard cross-entropy\nloss for training CABACE. We further leverage pseudo labelling and adversarial\ndata generation to improve the generalizability of the framework. Experimental\nresults prove the superiority of the proposed framework in comparison to\nvarious baselines. Additionally, we show that the proposed framework is better\nsuited than baseline models for zero-shot generalization to non-English\nlanguages, thus reinforcing the effectiveness of our approach.

    "abstract": "We consider the dynamic pricing problem with covariates under a generalized\nlinear demand model: a seller can dynamically adjust the price of a product\nover a horizon of $T$ time periods, and at each time period $t$, the demand of\nthe product is jointly determined by the price and an observable covariate\nvector $x_t\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ through an unknown generalized linear model. Most\nof the existing literature assumes the covariate vectors $x_t$'s are\nindependently and identically distributed (i.i.d.); the few papers that relax\nthis assumption either sacrifice model generality or yield sub-optimal regret\nbounds. In this paper we show that a simple pricing algorithm has an\n$O(d\\sqrt{T}\\log T)$ regret upper bound without assuming any statistical\nstructure on the covariates $x_t$ (which can even be arbitrarily chosen). The\nupper bound on the regret matches the lower bound (even under the i.i.d.\nassumption) up to logarithmic factors. Our paper thus shows that (i) the i.i.d.\nassumption is not necessary for obtaining low regret, and (ii) the regret bound\ncan be independent of the (inverse) minimum eigenvalue of the covariance matrix\nof the $x_t$'s, a quantity present in previous bounds.

In this context, the optimization\nlandscape may contain spurious stationary points (SSPs), which are proved to be\nfull-rank matrices. The presence of these SSPs means that it is impossible to\nhope for any global guarantees in over-parametrized matrix factorization. For\nexample, when initialized at an SSP, the gradient flow will be trapped there\nforever. Nevertheless, despite these SSPs, we establish in this work that the\ngradient flow of the corresponding merit function converges to a global\nminimizer, provided that its initialization is rank-deficient and sufficiently\nclose to the feasible set of the optimization problem. We numerically observe\nthat a heuristic discretization of the proposed gradient flow, inspired by\nprimal-dual algorithms, is successful when initialized randomly. Our result is\nin sharp contrast with the local refinement methods which require an\ninitialization close to the optimal set of the optimization problem. More\nspecifically, we successfully avoid the traps set by the SSPs because the\ngradient flow remains rank-deficient at all times, and not because there are no\nSSPs nearby.

We show several properties attained by this loss formulation,\nincluding its differentiability, the efficient computation of first- and\nsecond-order derivatives, and its relationship to the traditional prediction\nloss, which strictly enforces complementarity. We apply this violation-based\nloss formulation to learn LCSs with tens of thousands of (potentially stiff)\nhybrid modes. The results demonstrate a state-of-the-art ability to identify\npiecewise-affine dynamics, outperforming methods which must differentiate\nthrough non-smooth linear complementarity problems.",

At the same time, genomic data has become valuable for reuse beyond their\ninitial point of collection, but privacy concerns often hinder access. Over the\npast several years, Beacon services have emerged to broaden accessibility to\nsuch data. These services enable users to query for the presence of a\nparticular minor allele in a private dataset, information that can help care\nproviders determine if genomic variation is spurious or has some known clinical\nindication. However, various studies have shown that even this limited access\nmodel can leak if individuals are members in the underlying dataset. Several\napproaches for mitigating this vulnerability have been proposed, but they are\nlimited in that they 1) typically rely on heuristics and 2) offer probabilistic\nprivacy guarantees, but neglect utility. In this paper, we present a novel\nalgorithmic framework to ensure privacy in a Beacon service setting with a\nminimal number of query response flips (e.g., changing a positive response to a\nnegative). Specifically, we represent this problem as combinatorial\noptimization in both the batch setting (where queries arrive all at once), as\nwell as the online setting (where queries arrive sequentially). The former\nsetting has been the primary focus in prior literature, whereas real Beacons\nallow sequential queries, motivating the latter investigation.

Inspired by the evidence that pure self-attention possesses a\nstrong inductive bias that leads to the transformer losing the expressive power\nwith respect to network depth, we propose a transformer architecture with a\nmitigatory self-attention mechanism by applying possible direct mapping\nconnections in the transformer architecture to mitigate the rank collapse so as\nto counteract feature expression loss and enhance the model performance.

The formed residual self-attention network\naddresses two critical issues: (1) stop the self-attention networks from\ndegenerating to rank-1 to the maximized degree; and (2) further diversify the\npath distribution of parameter update so that easier attention learning is\nexpected. Miti-DETR significantly enhances the average detection precision and\nconvergence speed towards existing DETR-based models on the challenging COCO\nobject detection dataset.

Such bugs are even more dangerous in DL applications and\nframeworks due to the \"black-box\" and stochastic nature of the systems (the end\nuser can not understand how the model makes decisions). This paper presents the\nfirst empirical study of Keras and TensorFlow silent bugs, and their impact on\nusers' programs. We extracted closed issues related to Keras from the\nTensorFlow GitHub repository. Out of the 1,168 issues that we gathered, 77 were\nreproducible silent bugs affecting users' programs. We categorized the bugs\nbased on the effects on the users' programs and the components where the issues\noccurred, using information from the issue reports. We then derived a threat\nlevel for each of the issues, based on the impact they had on the users'\nprograms. To assess the relevance of identified categories and the impact\nscale, we conducted an online survey with 103 DL developers. The participants\ngenerally agreed with the significant impact of silent bugs in DL libraries and\nacknowledged our findings (i.e., categories of silent bugs and the proposed\nimpact scale).

Lots of methods are proposed to tackle this problem, and\nmost of them are based on the feature that a pre-trained network can transfer\nits knowledge to the next base model and then accelerate the training process.\nHowever, these methods suffer a severe problem that all of them transfer\nknowledge without selection and thus lead to low diversity. As the effect of\nensemble learning is more pronounced if ensemble members are accurate and\ndiverse, we propose a method named Efficient Diversity-Driven Ensemble (EDDE)\nto address both the diversity and the efficiency of an ensemble. To accelerate\nthe training process, we propose a novel knowledge transfer method which can\nselectively transfer the previous generic knowledge. To enhance diversity, we\nfirst propose a new diversity measure, then use it to define a diversity-driven\nloss function for optimization.

Reannotating the entire dataset is one probable\nsolution however it is not always viable due to time and budget constraints.\nThis paper addresses the problem of efficient reannotation of a large noisy\ndataset for the RC. Our goal is to catch more annotation errors in the dataset\nwhile reannotating fewer instances. Existing work on RC dataset reannotation\nlacks the flexibility about how much data to reannotate. We introduce the\nconcept of a reannotation budget to overcome this limitation. The immediate\nfollow-up problem is: Given a specific reannotation budget, which subset of the\ndata should we reannotate? To address this problem, we present two strategies\nto selectively reannotate RC datasets. Our strategies utilize the taxonomic\nhierarchy of relation labels. The intuition of our work is to rely on the graph\ndistance between actual and predicted relation labels in the label hierarchy\ngraph. We evaluate our reannotation strategies on the well-known TACRED\ndataset. We design our experiments to answer three specific research questions.\nFirst, does our strategy select novel candidates for reannotation? Second, for\na given reannotation budget is our reannotation strategy more efficient at\ncatching annotation errors? Third, what is the impact of data reannotation on\nRC model performance measurement? Experimental results show that our both\nreannotation strategies are novel and efficient.

The transcription of handwritten content\npresent in digitized documents is significant in analyzing historical archives\nor digitizing information from handwritten documents, forms, and\ncommunications. In the last years, great advances have been made in this area\ndue to applying deep learning techniques to its resolution. This Thesis\naddresses the offline continuous handwritten text recognition (HTR) problem,\nconsisting of developing algorithms and models capable of transcribing the text\npresent in an image without the need for the text to be segmented into\ncharacters. For this purpose, we have proposed a new recognition model based on\nintegrating two types of deep learning architectures: convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNN) and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, respectively. The\nconvolutional component of the model is oriented to identify relevant features\npresent in characters, and the seq2seq component builds the transcription of\nthe text by modeling the sequential nature of the text. For the design of this\nnew model, an extensive analysis of the capabilities of different convolutional\narchitectures in the simplified problem of isolated character recognition has\nbeen carried out in order to identify the most suitable ones to be integrated\ninto the continuous model. Additionally, extensive experimentation of the\nproposed model for the continuous problem has been carried out to determine its\nrobustness to changes in parameterization. The generalization capacity of the\nmodel has also been validated by evaluating it on three handwritten text\ndatabases using different languages: IAM in English, RIMES in French, and\nOsborne in Spanish, respectively. The new proposed model provides competitive\nresults with those obtained with other well-established methodologies.",

    "title": "MPCLeague: Robust MPC Platform for Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning",
    "abstract": "In the modern era of computing, machine learning tools have demonstrated\ntheir potential in vital sectors, such as healthcare and finance, to derive\nproper inferences. The sensitive and confidential nature of the data in such\nsectors raises genuine concerns for data privacy. This motivated the area of\nPrivacy-preserving Machine Learning (PPML), where privacy of data is\nguaranteed. In this thesis, we design an efficient platform, MPCLeague, for\nPPML in the Secure Outsourced Computation (SOC) setting using Secure\nMulti-party Computation (MPC) techniques.\nMPC, the holy-grail problem of secure distributed computing, enables a set of\nn mutually distrusting parties to perform joint computation on their private\ninputs in a way that no coalition of t parties can learn more information than\nthe output (privacy) or affect the true output of the computation\n(correctness). While MPC, in general, has been a subject of extensive research,\nthe area of MPC with a small number of parties has drawn popularity of late\nmainly due to its application to real-time scenarios, efficiency and\nsimplicity. This thesis focuses on designing efficient MPC frameworks for 2, 3\nand 4 parties, with at most one corruption and supports ring structures.\nAt the heart of this thesis are four frameworks - ASTRA, SWIFT, Tetrad,\nABY2.0 - catered to different settings. The practicality of our framework is\nargued through improvements in the benchmarking of widely used ML algorithms --\nLinear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and Support Vector\nMachines. We propose two variants for each of our frameworks, with one variant\naiming to minimise the execution time while the other focuses on the monetary\ncost. The concrete efficiency gains of our frameworks coupled with the stronger\nsecurity guarantee of robustness make our platform an ideal choice for a\nreal-time deployment of PPML techniques.",

    "abstract": "Recent analysis on speech emotion recognition has made considerable advances\nwith the use of MFCCs spectrogram features and the implementation of neural\nnetwork approaches such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Capsule\nnetworks (CapsNet) have gained gratitude as alternatives to CNNs with their\nlarger capacities for hierarchical representation. To address these issues,\nthis research introduces a text-independent and speaker-independent SER novel\narchitecture, where a dual-channel long short-term memory compressed-CapsNet\n(DC-LSTM COMP-CapsNet) algorithm is proposed based on the structural features\nof CapsNet. Our proposed novel classifier can ensure the energy efficiency of\nthe model and adequate compression method in speech emotion recognition, which\nis not delivered through the original structure of a CapsNet. Moreover, the\ngrid search approach is used to attain optimal solutions. Results witnessed an\nimproved performance and reduction in the training and testing running time.\nThe speech datasets used to evaluate our algorithm are: Arabic Emirati-accented\ncorpus, English speech under simulated and actual stress corpus, English\nRyerson audio-visual database of emotional speech and song corpus, and\ncrowd-sourced emotional multimodal actors dataset. This work reveals that the\noptimum feature extraction method compared to other known methods is MFCCs\ndelta-delta. Using the four datasets and the MFCCs delta-delta, DC-LSTM\nCOMP-CapsNet surpasses all the state-of-the-art systems, classical classifiers,\nCNN, and the original CapsNet. Using the Arabic Emirati-accented corpus, our\nresults demonstrate that the proposed work yields average emotion recognition\naccuracy of 89.3% compared to 84.7%, 82.2%, 69.8%, 69.2%, 53.8%, 42.6%, and\n31.9% based on CapsNet, CNN, support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron,\nk-nearest neighbor, radial basis function, and naive Bayes, respectively.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we conducted an empirical comparative study of the performance\nof text-independent speaker verification in emotional and stressful\nenvironments. This work combined deep models with shallow architecture, which\nresulted in novel hybrid classifiers. Four distinct hybrid models were\nutilized: deep neural network-hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM), deep neural\nnetwork-Gaussian mixture model (DNN-GMM), Gaussian mixture model-deep neural\nnetwork (GMM-DNN), and hidden Markov model-deep neural network (HMM-DNN). All\nmodels were based on novel implemented architecture. The comparative study used\nthree distinct speech datasets: a private Arabic dataset and two public English\ndatabases, namely, Speech Under Simulated and Actual Stress (SUSAS) and Ryerson\nAudio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS). The test results\nof the aforementioned hybrid models demonstrated that the proposed HMM-DNN\nleveraged the verification performance in emotional and stressful environments.\nResults also showed that HMM-DNN outperformed all other hybrid models in terms\nof equal error rate (EER) and area under the curve (AUC) evaluation metrics.\nThe average resulting verification system based on the three datasets yielded\nEERs of 7.19%, 16.85%, 11.51%, and 11.90% based on HMM-DNN, DNN-HMM, DNN-GMM,\nand GMM-DNN, respectively. Furthermore, we found that the DNN-GMM model\ndemonstrated the least computational complexity compared to all other hybrid\nmodels in both talking environments.

    "abstract": "Efficient scheduling of distributed deep learning (DL) jobs in large GPU\nclusters is crucial for resource efficiency and job performance. While server\nsharing among jobs improves resource utilization, interference among co-located\nDL jobs occurs due to resource contention. Interference-aware job placement has\nbeen studied, with white-box approaches based on explicit interference modeling\nand black-box schedulers with reinforcement learning. In today's clusters\ncontaining thousands of GPU servers, running a single scheduler to manage all\narrival jobs in a timely and effective manner is challenging, due to the large\nworkload scale. We adopt multiple schedulers in a large-scale cluster/data\ncenter, and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) scheduling\nframework to cooperatively learn fine-grained job placement policies, towards\nthe objective of minimizing job completion time (JCT). To achieve\ntopology-aware placements, our proposed framework uses hierarchical graph\nneural networks to encode the data center topology and server architecture. In\nview of a common lack of precise reward samples corresponding to different\nplacements, a job interference model is further devised to predict interference\nlevels in face of various co-locations, for training of the MARL schedulers.\nTestbed and trace-driven evaluations show that our scheduler framework\noutperforms representative scheduling schemes by more than 20% in terms of\naverage JCT, and is adaptive to various machine learning cluster topologies.",

    "abstract": "The field of General Reinforcement Learning (GRL) formulates the problem of\nsequential decision-making from ground up. The history of interaction\nconstitutes a \"ground\" state of the system, which never repeats. On the one\nhand, this generality allows GRL to model almost every domain possible, e.g.\\\nBandits, MDPs, POMDPs, PSRs, and history-based environments. On the other hand,\nin general, the near-optimal policies in GRL are functions of complete history,\nwhich hinders not only learning but also planning in GRL. The usual way around\nfor the planning part is that the agent is given a Markovian abstraction of the\nunderlying process. So, it can use any MDP planning algorithm to find a\nnear-optimal policy. The Extreme State Aggregation (ESA) framework has extended\nthis idea to non-Markovian abstractions without compromising on the possibility\nof planning through a (surrogate) MDP. A distinguishing feature of ESA is that\nit proves an upper bound of $O\\left(\\varepsilon^{-A} \\cdot\n(1-\\gamma)^{-2A}\\right)$ on the number of states required for the surrogate MDP\n(where $A$ is the number of actions, $\\gamma$ is the discount-factor, and\n$\\varepsilon$ is the optimality-gap) which holds \\emph{uniformly} for\n\\emph{all} domains.

The brain in our abstract model\nis a network of nodes and edges. Although it has some similarities to standard\nneural network models, as we show, there are some significant differences. Both\nnodes and edges in our network have weights and activation levels. They act as\nprobabilistic transducers that use a set of relatively simple rules to\ndetermine how activation levels and weights are affected by input, generate\noutput, and affect each other. We show that these simple rules enable a\nlearning process that allows the network to represent increasingly complex\nknowledge, and simultaneously to act as a computing device that facilitates\nplanning, decision-making, and the execution of behavior. By specifying the\ninnate (genetic) components of the network, we show how evolution could endow\nthe network with initial adaptive rules and goals that are then enriched\nthrough learning. We demonstrate how the developing structure of the network\n(which determines what the brain can do and how well) is critically affected by\nthe co-evolved coordination between the mechanisms affecting the distribution\nof data input and those determining the learning parameters (used in the\nprograms run by nodes and edges).

We formulate\nthe link prediction problem as a subgraph classification problem. We firstly\npropose an efficient two-level projection to decompose topological structures\nto node-edge pairs and project them into the same interaction feature space.\nThen we apply multi-layer GCN to combine the projected node-edge pairs to\ncapture the topological structures. Finally, the pooling representation of two\nunits is treated as the input of classifier to predict the probability. We\nconduct offline experiments on two industrial datasets and one public dataset\nand demonstrate that AGCN outperforms other excellent baselines. Moreover, we\nalso deploy AGCN method to important scenarios on Xianyu and AliExpress. In\nonline systems, AGCN achieves over 5% improvement on online metrics.",

Unlike the agents in traditional AI, the\nagents in artificial general intelligence (AGI) are required to replicate human\nintelligence in almost every domain of interest. Moreover, an AGI agent should\nbe able to achieve this without (virtually any) further changes, retraining, or\nfine-tuning of the parameters. The real world is non-stationary, non-ergodic,\nand non-Markovian: we, humans, can neither revisit our past nor are the most\nrecent observations sufficient statistics. Yet, we excel at a variety of\ncomplex tasks. Many of these tasks require longterm planning. We can associate\nthis success to our natural faculty to abstract away task-irrelevant\ninformation from our overwhelming sensory experience. We make task-specific\nmental models of the world without much effort. Due to this ability to\nabstract, we can plan on a significantly compact representation of a task\nwithout much loss of performance.

Unfortunately its success\ncomes at the expense of an explicit memory to store samples from past tasks,\nwhich hampers scalability to continual learning settings with a large number of\ntasks. In this paper, we introduce generative kernel continual learning, which\nexplores and exploits the synergies between generative models and kernels for\ncontinual learning. The generative model is able to produce representative\nsamples for kernel learning, which removes the dependence on memory in kernel\ncontinual learning. Moreover, as we replay only on the generative model, we\navoid task interference while being computationally more efficient compared to\nprevious methods that need replay on the entire model. We further introduce a\nsupervised contrastive regularization, which enables our model to generate even\nmore discriminative samples for better kernel-based classification performance.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on three widely-used continual learning\nbenchmarks that demonstrate the abilities and benefits of our contributions.\nMost notably, on the challenging SplitCIFAR100 benchmark, with just a simple\nlinear kernel we obtain the same accuracy as kernel continual learning with\nvariational random features for one tenth of the memory, or a 10.1\\% accuracy\ngain for the same memory budget.",

An important\napplication where this problem occurs, and a decentralized solution is\ndesirable is in federated sketching: efficiently compressing the vast amounts\nof distributed images/videos generated by smartphones and various other devices\nwhile respecting the users' privacy. Images from different devices, once\ngrouped by category, are similar and hence the matrix formed by the vectorized\nimages of a certain category is well-modeled as being low rank. Suppose there\nare p nodes (say p smartphones), and each store a subset of the sketches of its\nimages. We develop a decentralized projected gradient descent (GD) based\napproach to jointly reconstruct the images of all the phones/users from their\nrespective stored sketches. The algorithm is such that the phones/users never\nshare their raw data but only summaries of this data with the other phones at\neach algorithm iteration. Also, the reconstructed images of user g are obtained\nonly locally. Other users cannot reconstruct them. Only the column span of the\nmatrix is reconstructed globally. By \"decentralized\" we mean that there is no\ncentral node to which all nodes are connected and thus the only way to\naggregate the summaries from the various nodes is by use of an iterative\nconsensus algorithm that eventually provides an estimate of the aggregate at\neach node, as long as the network is strongly connected.

    "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition (SER) processes speech signals to detect and\ncharacterize expressed perceived emotions. Many SER application systems often\nacquire and transmit speech data collected at the client-side to remote cloud\nplatforms for inference and decision making. However, speech data carry rich\ninformation not only about emotions conveyed in vocal expressions, but also\nother sensitive demographic traits such as gender, age and language background.\nConsequently, it is desirable for SER systems to have the ability to classify\nemotion constructs while preventing unintended/improper inferences of sensitive\nand demographic information. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine\nlearning paradigm that coordinates clients to train a model collaboratively\nwithout sharing their local data. This training approach appears secure and can\nimprove privacy for SER. However, recent works have demonstrated that FL\napproaches are still vulnerable to various privacy attacks like reconstruction\nattacks and membership inference attacks. Although most of these have focused\non computer vision applications, such information leakages exist in the SER\nsystems trained using the FL technique. To assess the information leakage of\nSER systems trained using FL, we propose an attribute inference attack\nframework that infers sensitive attribute information of the clients from\nshared gradients or model parameters, corresponding to the FedSGD and the\nFedAvg training algorithms, respectively. As a use case, we empirically\nevaluate our approach for predicting the client's gender information using\nthree SER benchmark datasets: IEMOCAP, CREMA-D, and MSP-Improv. We show that\nthe attribute inference attack is achievable for SER systems trained using FL.\nWe further identify that most information leakage possibly comes from the first\nlayer in the SER model.",

Nevertheless, due to the stochastic character of earthquakes and\nthe challenge of achieving an efficient and dependable model for earthquake\nprediction, efforts have been insufficient thus far, and new methods are\nrequired to solve this problem. Aware of these issues, this paper proposes a\nnovel prediction method based on attention mechanism (AM), convolution neural\nnetwork (CNN), and bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) models, which\ncan predict the number and maximum magnitude of earthquakes in each area of\nmainland China-based on the earthquake catalog of the region.

Secondly, to\neffectively use spatial information and reduce dimensions of input data, the\nCNN is used to capture the spatial dependencies between earthquake data.\nThirdly, the Bi-LSTM layer is employed to capture the temporal dependencies.\nFourthly, the AM layer is introduced to highlight its important features to\nachieve better prediction performance.

Our main objective is to establish what features of the model of the\nmobile agent and the environment allow linear exploration time. We study agents\nthat, upon entering to a node, do not receive as input the edge via which they\nentered. In such a model, deterministic memoryless exploration is infeasible,\nhence the agent needs to be allowed to use some memory. The memory can be\nlocated at the agent or at each node. The existing lower bounds show that if\nthe memory is either only at the agent or only at the nodes, then the\nexploration needs superlinear time. We show that tree exploration in\ndual-memory model, with constant memory at the agent and logarithmic at each\nnode is possible in linear time when one of two additional features is present:\nfixed initial state of the memory at each node (so called clean memory) or a\nsingle movable token. We present two algorithms working in linear time for\narbitrary trees in these two models. On the other hand, in our lower bound we\nshow that if the agent has a single bit of memory and one bit is present at\neach node, then exploration may require quadratic time on paths, if the initial\nmemory at nodes could be set arbitrarily (so called dirty memory). This shows\nthat having clean node memory or a token allows linear exploration of trees in\nthe model with two types of memory, but having neither of those features may\nlead to quadratic exploration time even on a simple path.",

    "title": "A Linear-Time Algorithm for Steady-State Analysis of Electromigration in  General Interconnects",
    "abstract": "Electromigration (EM) is a key reliability issue in deeply scaled technology\nnodes. Traditional EM methods first filter immortal wires using the Blech\ncriterion, and then perform EM analysis based on Black's equation on the\nremaining wires. The Blech criterion is based on finding the steady-state\nstress in a two-terminal wire segment, but most on-chip structures are\nconsiderably more complex. Current-density-based assessment methodologies,\ni.e., Black's equation and the Blech criterion, which are predominantly used to\ndetect EM-susceptible wires, do not capture the physics of EM, but alternative\nphysics-based methods involve the solution of differential equations and are\nslow. This paper uses first principles, based on solving fundamental stress\nequations that relate electron wind and back-stress forces to the stress\nevolution in an interconnect, and devises a technique that analyzes any general\ntree or mesh interconnect structure to test for immortality. The resulting\nsolution is extremely computationally efficient and its computation time is\nlinear in the number of metal segments. Two variants of the method are\nproposed: a current-density-based method that requires traversals of the\ninterconnect graph, and a voltage-based formulation negates the need for any\ntraversals. The methods are applied to large interconnect networks for\ndetermining the steady-state stress at all nodes and test all segments of each\nnetwork for immortality. The proposed model is applied to a variety of tree and\nmesh structures and is demonstrated to be fast. By construction, it is an exact\nsolution and it is demonstrated to match much more computationally expensive\nnumerical simulations.",

The results showed that the correct recognition rate of the\nshapes was higher when the haptically active area was larger. However, as the\nnumber of edges increased, the recognition time increased and the recognition\nrate dropped significantly, arriving to a value slightly higher than the chance\nrate of 20% for non-prototypical octagon. We also recorded the participants'\nfinger movements on the touchscreen to examine their haptic exploration\nstrategies. Our analyses revealed that the participants first used global\nscanning to extract the coarse features of the displayed shapes, and then they\napplied local scanning to identify finer details, but needed another global\nscan for final confirmation in the case of non-prototypical shapes, possibly\ndue to the current limitations of electrovibration technology in displaying\ntactile stimuli to a user.

    "abstract": "Drug-mediated blockade of the voltage-gated potassium channel(hERG) and the\nvoltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.5) can lead to severe cardiovascular\ncomplications. This rising concern has been reflected in the drug development\narena, as the frequent emergence of cardiotoxicity from many approved drugs led\nto either discontinuing their use or, in some cases, their withdrawal from the\nmarket. Predicting potential hERG and Nav1.5 blockers at the outset of the drug\ndiscovery process can resolve this problem and can, therefore, decrease the\ntime and expensive cost of developing safe drugs. One fast and cost-effective\napproach is to use in silico predictive methods to weed out potential hERG and\nNav1.5 blockers at the early stages of drug development. Here, we introduce two\nrobust 2D descriptor-based QSAR predictive models for both hERG and Nav1.5\nliability predictions. The machine learning models were trained for both\nregression, predicting the potency value of a drug, and multiclass\nclassification at three different potency cut-offs (i.e. 1$\\mu$M, 10$\\mu$M, and\n30$\\mu$M), where ToxTree-hERG Classifier, a pipeline of Random Forest models,\nwas trained on a large curated dataset of 8380 unique molecular compounds.\nWhereas ToxTree-Nav1.5 Classifier, a pipeline of kernelized SVM models, was\ntrained on a large manually curated set of 1550 unique compounds retrieved from\nboth ChEMBL and PubChem publicly available bioactivity databases. The proposed\nhERG inducer outperformed most metrics of the state-of-the-art published model\nand other existing tools.

    "abstract": "The Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) is a fundamental\noptimization model for Transmission System Operators (TSO) to clear real-time\nenergy markets while ensuring reliable operations of power grids. In a context\nof growing operational uncertainty, due to increased penetration of renewable\ngenerators and distributed energy resources, operators must continuously\nmonitor risk in real-time, i.e., they must quickly assess the system's behavior\nunder various changes in load and renewable production. Unfortunately,\nsystematically solving an optimization problem for each such scenario is not\npractical given the tight constraints of real-time operations. To overcome this\nlimitation, this paper proposes to learn an optimization proxy for SCED, i.e.,\na Machine Learning (ML) model that can predict an optimal solution for SCED in\nmilliseconds. Motivated by a principled analysis of the market-clearing\noptimizations of MISO, the paper proposes a novel ML pipeline that addresses\nthe main challenges of learning SCED solutions, i.e., the variability in load,\nrenewable output and production costs, as well as the combinatorial structure\nof commitment decisions. A novel Classification-Then-Regression architecture is\nalso proposed, to further capture the behavior of SCED solutions. Numerical\nexperiments are reported on the French transmission system, and demonstrate the\napproach's ability to produce, within a time frame that is compatible with\nreal-time operations, accurate optimization proxies that produce relative\nerrors below $0.6\\%$.",

Most of the existing methods perform video summarization on\nindividual videos, which neglects the correlations among similar videos. Such\ncorrelations, however, are also informative for video understanding and video\nsummarization. To address this limitation, we propose Video Joint Modelling\nbased on Hierarchical Transformer (VJMHT) for co-summarization, which takes\ninto consideration the semantic dependencies across videos. Specifically, VJMHT\nconsists of two layers of Transformer: the first layer extracts semantic\nrepresentation from individual shots of similar videos, while the second layer\nperforms shot-level video joint modelling to aggregate cross-video semantic\ninformation. By this means, complete cross-video high-level patterns are\nexplicitly modelled and learned for the summarization of individual videos.\nMoreover, Transformer-based video representation reconstruction is introduced\nto maximize the high-level similarity between the summary and the original\nvideo. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the\nproposed modules and the superiority of VJMHT in terms of F-measure and\nrank-based evaluation.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in interactive learning and decision making, ranging\nfrom bandit problems to reinforcement learning, is to provide sample-efficient,\nadaptive learning algorithms that achieve near-optimal regret. This question is\nanalogous to the classical problem of optimal (supervised) statistical\nlearning, where there are well-known complexity measures (e.g., VC dimension\nand Rademacher complexity) that govern the statistical complexity of learning.\nHowever, characterizing the statistical complexity of interactive learning is\nsubstantially more challenging due to the adaptive nature of the problem. The\nmain result of this work provides a complexity measure, the Decision-Estimation\nCoefficient, that is proven to be both necessary and sufficient for\nsample-efficient interactive learning. In particular, we provide:\n1. a lower bound on the optimal regret for any interactive decision making\nproblem, establishing the Decision-Estimation Coefficient as a fundamental\nlimit.\n2. a unified algorithm design principle, Estimation-to-Decisions (E2D), which\ntransforms any algorithm for supervised estimation into an online algorithm for\ndecision making. E2D attains a regret bound matching our lower bound, thereby\nachieving optimal sample-efficient learning as characterized by the\nDecision-Estimation Coefficient.\nTaken together, these results constitute a theory of learnability for\ninteractive decision making. When applied to reinforcement learning settings,\nthe Decision-Estimation Coefficient recovers essentially all existing hardness\nresults and lower bounds. More broadly, the approach can be viewed as a\ndecision-theoretic analogue of the classical Le Cam theory of statistical\nestimation; it also unifies a number of existing approaches -- both Bayesian\nand frequentist.",

    "abstract": "Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has been used as a non-destructive tool for\ntree root inspection. Estimating root-related parameters from GPR radargrams\ngreatly facilitates root health monitoring and imaging. However, the task of\nestimating root-related parameters is challenging as the root reflection is a\ncomplex function of multiple root parameters and root orientations. Existing\nmethods can only estimate a single root parameter at a time without considering\nthe influence of other parameters and root orientations, resulting in limited\nestimation accuracy under different root conditions. In addition, soil\nheterogeneity introduces clutter in GPR radargrams, making the data processing\nand interpretation even harder. To address these issues, a novel neural network\narchitecture, called mask-guided multi-polarimetric integration neural network\n(MMI-Net), is proposed to automatically and simultaneously estimate multiple\nroot-related parameters in heterogeneous soil environments. The MMI-Net\nincludes two sub-networks: a MaskNet that predicts a mask to highlight the root\nreflection area to eliminate interfering environmental clutter, and a ParaNet\nthat uses the predicted mask as guidance to integrate, extract, and emphasize\ninformative features in multi-polarimetric radargrams for accurate estimation\nof five key root-related parameters. The parameters include the root depth,\ndiameter, relative permittivity, horizontal and vertical orientation angles.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed MMI-Net achieves high\nestimation accuracy in these root-related parameters. This is the first work\nthat takes the combined contributions of root parameters and spatial\norientations into account and simultaneously estimates multiple root-related\nparameters.

While these classifiers report generally good performance\nwhen evaluated on a test set, questions remain as to how well they extend to\nunseen data in various forms.\nThis study evaluates machine learning classifiers performance on feedback for\ntwo common classification tasks (classifying bug reports and feature requests).\nUsing seven datasets from prior research studies, we investigate the\nperformance of classifiers when evaluated on feedback from different apps than\nthose contained in the training set and when evaluated on completely different\ndatasets (coming from different feedback platforms and/or labelled by different\nresearchers). We also measure the difference in performance of using\nplatform-specific metadata as a feature in classification.\nWe demonstrate that classification performance is similar on feedback from\nunseen apps compared to seen apps in the majority of cases tested. However, the\nclassifiers do not perform well on unseen datasets. We show that multi-dataset\ntraining or zero shot classification approaches can somewhat mitigate this\nperformance decrease. Finally, we find that using metadata as features in\nclassifying bug reports and feature requests does not lead to a statistically\nsignificant improvement in the majority of datasets tested. We discuss the\nimplications of these results on developing user feedback classification models\nto analyse and extract software requirements.",

One fundamental challenge in this research is that the\ntreatment assignment bias in observational data. To increase the validity of\nobservational studies on causal inference, representation based methods as the\nstate-of-the-art have demonstrated the superior performance of treatment effect\nestimation. Most representation based methods assume all observed covariates\nare pre-treatment (i.e., not affected by the treatment), and learn a balanced\nrepresentation from these observed covariates for estimating treatment effect.\nUnfortunately, this assumption is often too strict a requirement in practice,\nas some covariates are changed by doing an intervention on treatment (i.e.,\npost-treatment).

This paper focuses on using\nstructural regularities without any constraints, such as the Manhattan world\nassumption. For this, we use the vanishing points that can be obtained from the\nline features. The difference between the vanishing point observation\ncalculated through line features in the image and the vanishing point\nestimation calculated through the direction vector is defined as a residual and\nadded to the cost function of optimization-based SLAM.

First, null events are added to the event-based data to generate\nadditional adversarial events. The perturbation size can be controlled with the\nnumber of null events. Second, the location and time of additional adversarial\nevents are set to mislead DNNs in a gradient-based attack. Our algorithm\nachieves an attack success rate of 97.95\\% on the N-Caltech101 dataset.\nFurthermore, the adversarial training model improves robustness on the\nadversarial event data compared to the original model.",

Though several approaches have\nbeen proposed, most existing few-shot learning (FSL) models assume that base\nand novel classes are drawn from the same data domain. When it comes to\nrecognizing novel-class data in an unseen domain, this becomes an even more\nchallenging task of domain generalized few-shot classification. In this paper,\nwe present a unique learning framework for domain-generalized few-shot\nclassification, where base classes are from homogeneous multiple source\ndomains, while novel classes to be recognized are from target domains which are\nnot seen during training. By advancing meta-learning strategies, our learning\nframework exploits data across multiple source domains to capture\ndomain-invariant features, with FSL ability introduced by metric-learning based\nmechanisms across support and query data. We conduct extensive experiments to\nverify the effectiveness of our proposed learning framework and show learning\nfrom small yet homogeneous source data is able to perform preferably against\nlearning from large-scale one.

In such DNN-based systems, error resilience is a top priority since\nfaults in DNN inference could lead to mispredictions and safety hazards. For\nlatency-critical DNN inference on resource-constrained edge devices, it is\nnontrivial to apply conventional redundancy-based fault tolerance techniques.\nIn this paper, we propose FitAct, a low-cost approach to enhance the error\nresilience of DNNs by deploying fine-grained post-trainable activation\nfunctions.

To address these problems, a novel method,\nnamely, Vision Reservoir computing (ViR), is proposed here for image\nclassification, as a parallel to ViT. By splitting each image into a sequence\nof tokens with fixed length, the ViR constructs a pure reservoir with a nearly\nfully connected topology to replace the Transformer module in ViT. Two kinds of\ndeep ViR models are subsequently proposed to enhance the network performance.\nComparative experiments between the ViR and the ViT are carried out on several\nimage classification benchmarks. Without any pre-training process, the ViR\noutperforms the ViT in terms of both model and computational complexity.\nSpecifically, the number of parameters of the ViR is about 15% even 5% of the\nViT, and the memory footprint is about 20% to 40% of the ViT. The superiority\nof the ViR performance is explained by Small-World characteristics, Lyapunov\nexponents, and memory capacity.",

However, current deep learning solutions are difficult to\nlearn a model that possesses these two properties without degrading one or the\nother. As is well known, the fully-connected layers contribute most of the\nparameters of convolutional neural networks. We perform a separable structural\ntransformation of the fully-connected layer to reduce the parameters, where the\nlarge-scale weight matrix of the fully-connected layer is decoupled by the\ntensor product of several separable small-sized matrices. Note that data, such\nas images, no longer need to be flattened before being fed to the\nfully-connected layer, retaining the valuable spatial geometric information of\nthe data. Moreover, in order to further enhance both lightweight and\nrobustness, we propose a joint constraint of sparsity and differentiable\ncondition number, which is imposed on these separable matrices. We evaluate the\nproposed approach on MLP, VGG-16 and Vision Transformer. The experimental\nresults on datasets such as ImageNet, SVHN, CIFAR-100 and CIFAR10 show that we\nsuccessfully reduce the amount of network parameters by 90%, while the robust\naccuracy loss is less than 1.5%, which is better than the SOTA methods based on\nthe original fully-connected layer.

Existing methods deal with heterophily\nby mainly aggregating higher-order neighborhoods or combing the immediate\nrepresentations, which leads to noise and irrelevant information in the result.\nBut these methods did not change the propagation mechanism which works under\nhomophily assumption (that is a fundamental part of GCNs). This makes it\ndifficult to distinguish the representation of nodes from different classes. To\naddress this problem, in this paper we design a novel propagation mechanism,\nwhich can automatically change the propagation and aggregation process\naccording to homophily or heterophily between node pairs. To adaptively learn\nthe propagation process, we introduce two measurements of homophily degree\nbetween node pairs, which is learned based on topological and attribute\ninformation, respectively. Then we incorporate the learnable homophily degree\ninto the graph convolution framework, which is trained in an end-to-end schema,\nenabling it to go beyond the assumption of homophily. More importantly, we\ntheoretically prove that our model can constrain the similarity of\nrepresentations between nodes according to their homophily degree.

We recast the resulting sub-problems as a convex second order cone\nprogramming (SOCP) and quadratic constraint quadratic programming (QCQP) for\nthe max-min and sum throughput maximization problems, respectively. We also\nconsider imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the HAP and CHs and\nnon-linearity in energy harvesting (EH) circuits. Numerical examples show that\nthe proposed cooperative method can effectively improve the achievable\nthroughput in the multi-cluster wireless powered communication under various\nsetups.",

    "title": "Chinese Learners' Phonetic Transfer of /i/ from Mandarin Chinese to  General American English: Evidence from Perception and Production Experiments",
    "abstract": "Ever since the development of Contrastive Analysis (CA) in the 1950s, which\nfocuses on comparing and contrasting two language systems, linguists have\nstarted to systematically explore the influence of the mother tongue on\nacquiring a second language. This phenomenon is later defined as \"language\ntransfer\". The current paper concerns language transfer at the phonetic level\nand concentrates on the transfer phenomenon existing in advanced-level Chinese\nlearners' acquisition of English vowels /i/ and its lax counterpart. By\ndetermining whether advanced-level Chinese English-language learners (ELLs) can\naccurately distinguish between /i/ and its lax counterpart, and pronounce them\nin English words precisely, this paper serves as a reference for further\nstudying Chinese ELLs' language transfer. Two objectives were to be met:\nfirstly, learners' perceptual ability to distinguish between vowels /i/ and its\nlax counterpart should be examined; and secondly, the effect of the phonetic\ntransfer should be determined. A perception test and a production test were\nused to attain these two objectives. Both tests were completed by 12\nadvanced-level Chinese ELLs, six males and six females. Results indicate that\nboth male and female participants could consciously distinguish between /i/ and\nits lax counterpart. All participants have signs of experiencing negative\nphonetic transfer in their pronunciation, except that the current data do not\ndecisively reflect an impact of the phonetic transfer on female ELLs'\nacquisition of the high front lax vowel in English words.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we use the Hawkes process to model the sequence of failure,\ni.e., events of compressor station and conduct survival analysis on various\nfailure events of the compressor station. However, until now, nearly all\nrelevant literatures of the Hawkes point processes assume that the base\nintensity of the conditional intensity function is time-invariant. This\nassumption is apparently too harsh to be verified. For example, in the\npractical application, including financial analysis, reliability analysis,\nsurvival analysis and social network analysis, the base intensity of the truth\nconditional intensity function is very likely to be time-varying. The constant\nbase intensity will not reflect the base probability of the failure occurring\nover time. Thus, in order to solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a\nnew time-varying base intensity, for example, which is from Weibull\ndistribution. First, we introduce the base intensity from the Weibull\ndistribution, and then we propose an effective learning algorithm by maximum\nlikelihood estimator. Experiments on the constant base intensity synthetic\ndata, time-varying base intensity synthetic data, and real-world data show that\nour method can learn the triggering patterns of the Hawkes processes and the\ntime-varying base intensity simultaneously and robustly. Experiments on the\nreal-world data reveal the Granger causality of different kinds of failures and\nthe base probability of failure varying over time.",

With superb power in modelling the interaction among multimodal\ninformation, multimodal image synthesis and editing have become a hot research\ntopic in recent years. Different from traditional visual guidance which\nprovides explicit clues, multimodal guidance offers intuitive and flexible\nmeans in image synthesis and editing. On the other hand, this field is also\nfacing several challenges in alignment of features with inherent modality gaps,\nsynthesis of high-resolution images, faithful evaluation metrics, etc. In this\nsurvey, we comprehensively contextualize the advance of the recent multimodal\nimage synthesis \\& editing and formulate taxonomies according to data modality\nand model architectures.

We then describe multimodal\nimage synthesis and editing approaches extensively with detailed frameworks\nincluding Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), GAN Inversion, Transformers,\nand other methods such as NeRF and Diffusion models. This is followed by a\ncomprehensive description of benchmark datasets and corresponding evaluation\nmetrics as widely adopted in multimodal image synthesis and editing, as well as\ndetailed comparisons of different synthesis methods with analysis of respective\nadvantages and limitations.

Bob wishes to guess $\\bx$,\nyet he is satisfied with finding any sequence $\\hat{\\bx}$ which is within a\ngiven distortion $D$ from $\\bx$. Thus, he successively submits queries to\nAlice, until receiving an affirmative answer, stating that his guess was within\nthe required distortion.\nFinding guessing strategies which minimize the number of guesses (the\n\\emph{guesswork}), and analyzing its properties (e.g., its $\\rho$--th moment)\nhas several applications in information security, source and channel coding.\nGuessing subject to a distortion constraint is especially useful when\nconsidering contemporary biometrically--secured systems, where the \"password\"\nwhich protects the data is not a single, fixed vector but rather a \\emph{ball\nof feature vectors} centered at some $\\bx$, and any feature vector within the\nball results in acceptance.\nWe formally define the guessing problem under distortion in \\emph{four\ndifferent setups}: memoryless sources, guessing through a noisy channel,\nsources with memory and individual sequences.

    "abstract": "Multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) aims to translate multiple\nlanguages with a single model and has been proved successful thanks to\neffective knowledge transfer among different languages with shared parameters.\nHowever, it is still an open question which parameters should be shared and\nwhich ones need to be task-specific. Currently, the common practice is to\nheuristically design or search language-specific modules, which is difficult to\nfind the optimal configuration. In this paper, we propose a novel parameter\ndifferentiation based method that allows the model to determine which\nparameters should be language-specific during training. Inspired by cellular\ndifferentiation, each shared parameter in our method can dynamically\ndifferentiate into more specialized types. We further define the\ndifferentiation criterion as inter-task gradient similarity. Therefore,\nparameters with conflicting inter-task gradients are more likely to be\nlanguage-specific. Extensive experiments on multilingual datasets have\ndemonstrated that our method significantly outperforms various strong baselines\nwith different parameter sharing configurations. Further analyses reveal that\nthe parameter sharing configuration obtained by our method correlates well with\nthe linguistic proximities.",

Towards a compact and\nefficient pipeline for multi-person pose estimation task, in this paper, we\npropose to represent the human parts as points and present a novel body\nrepresentation, which leverages an adaptive point set including the human\ncenter and seven human-part related points to represent the human instance in a\nmore fine-grained manner.

    "abstract": "Conformance checking (CC) techniques of the process mining field gauge the\nconformance of the sequence of events in a case with respect to a business\nprocess model, which simply put is an amalgam of certain behavioral relations\nor rules. Online conformance checking (OCC) techniques are tailored for\nassessing such conformance on streaming events. The realistic assumption of\nhaving a finite memory for storing the streaming events has largely not been\nconsidered by the OCC techniques. We propose three incremental approaches to\nreduce the memory consumption in prefix-alignment-based OCC techniques along\nwith ensuring that we incur a minimum loss of the conformance insights. Our\nfirst proposed approach bounds the number of maximum states that constitute a\nprefix-alignment to be retained by any case in memory. The second proposed\napproach bounds the number of cases that are allowed to retain more than a\nsingle state, referred to as multi-state cases. Building on top of the two\nproposed approaches, our third approach further bounds the number of maximum\nstates that the multi-state cases can retain. All these approaches forget the\nstates in excess to their defined limits and retain a meaningful summary of\nthem. Computing prefix-alignments in the future is then resumed for such cases\nfrom the current position contained in the summary. We highlight the\nsuperiority of all proposed approaches compared to a state of the art\nprefix-alignment-based OCC technique through experiments using real-life event\ndata under a streaming setting. Our approaches substantially reduce memory\nconsumption by up to 80% on average, while introducing a minor accuracy drop.",

This paper proposes an integrated long-term\nrecurrent convolutional network (ILRCN) model to predict electricity prices\nconsidering the majority contributing attributes to the market price as input.\nThe proposed ILRCN model combines the functionalities of convolutional neural\nnetwork and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm along with the proposed\nnovel conditional error correction term. The combined ILRCN model can identify\nthe linear and non-linear behavior within the input data. We have used ERCOT\nwholesale market price data along with load profile, temperature, and other\nfactors for the Houston region to illustrate the proposed model. The\nperformance of the proposed ILRCN electricity price forecasting model is\nverified using performance/evaluation metrics like mean absolute error and\naccuracy. Case studies reveal that the proposed ILRCN model is accurate and\nefficient in electricity price forecasting as compared to the support vector\nmachine (SVM) model, fully-connected neural network model, LSTM model and the\nLRCN model without the conditional error correction stage.",

    "abstract": "Thanks to the rapid advances in deep learning techniques and the wide\navailability of large-scale training sets, the performance of video saliency\ndetection models has been improving steadily and significantly. However, deep\nlearning-based visualaudio fixation prediction is still in its infancy. At\npresent, only a few visual-audio sequences have been furnished, with real\nfixations being recorded in real visual-audio environments. Hence, it would be\nneither efficient nor necessary to recollect real fixations under the same\nvisual-audio circumstances. To address this problem, this paper promotes a\nnovel approach in a weakly supervised manner to alleviate the demand of\nlarge-scale training sets for visual-audio model training. By using only the\nvideo category tags, we propose the selective class activation mapping (SCAM)\nand its upgrade (SCAM+). In the spatial-temporal-audio circumstance, the former\nfollows a coarse-to-fine strategy to select the most discriminative regions,\nand these regions are usually capable of exhibiting high consistency with the\nreal human-eye fixations. The latter equips the SCAM with an additional\nmulti-granularity perception mechanism, making the whole process more\nconsistent with that of the real human visual system. Moreover, we distill\nknowledge from these regions to obtain complete new spatial-temporal-audio\n(STA) fixation prediction (FP) networks, enabling broad applications in cases\nwhere video tags are not available. Without resorting to any real human-eye\nfixation, the performances of these STA FP networks are comparable to those of\nfully supervised networks.

We provide a simple approach to\ntranslate a graph structure into logical expressions, so that the link\nprediction task can be converted into a neural logic reasoning problem.

    "abstract": "When analyzing human motion videos, the output jitters from existing pose\nestimators are highly-unbalanced. Most frames only suffer from slight jitters,\nwhile significant jitters occur in those frames with occlusion or poor image\nquality. Such complex poses often persist in videos, leading to consecutive\nframes with poor estimation results and large jitters. Existing pose smoothing\nsolutions based on temporal convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks,\nor low-pass filters cannot deal with such a long-term jitter problem without\nconsidering the significant and persistent errors within the jittering video\nsegment. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel plug-and-play\nrefinement network, namely SMOOTHNET, which can be attached to any existing\npose estimators to improve its temporal smoothness and enhance its per-frame\nprecision simultaneously. Especially, SMOOTHNET is a simple yet effective\ndata-driven fully-connected network with large receptive fields, effectively\nmitigating the impact of long-term jitters with unreliable estimation results.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on twelve backbone networks with seven\ndatasets across 2D and 3D pose estimation, body recovery, and downstream tasks.\nOur results demonstrate that the proposed SMOOTHNET consistently outperforms\nexisting solutions, especially on those clips with high errors and long-term\njitters.",

This\nproblem, known as the generalized orthogonal Procrustes problem (GOPP), has\nfound numerous applications in statistics, computer vision, and imaging\nscience. While one commonly-used method is finding the least squares estimator,\nit is generally an NP-hard problem to obtain the least squares estimator\nexactly due to the notorious nonconvexity. In this work, we apply the\nsemidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation and the generalized power method to\nsolve this generalized orthogonal Procrustes problem. In particular, we assume\nthe data are generated from a signal-plus-noise model: each observed point\ncloud is a noisy copy of the same unknown point cloud transformed by an unknown\northogonal matrix and also corrupted by additive Gaussian noise. We show that\nthe generalized power method (equivalently alternating minimization algorithm)\nwith spectral initialization converges to the unique global optimum to the SDP\nrelaxation, provided that the signal-to-noise ratio is high. Moreover, this\nlimiting point is exactly the least squares estimator and also the maximum\nlikelihood estimator. In addition, we derive a block-wise estimation error for\neach orthogonal matrix and the underlying point cloud. Our theoretical bound is\nnear-optimal in terms of the information-theoretic limit (only loose by a\nfactor of the dimension and a log factor). Our results significantly improve\nthe state-of-the-art results on the tightness of the SDP relaxation for the\ngeneralized orthogonal Procrustes problem, an open problem posed by Bandeira,\nKhoo, and Singer in 2014.",

    "title": "BALanCe: Deep Bayesian Active Learning via Equivalence Class Annealing",
    "abstract": "Active learning has demonstrated data efficiency in many fields. Existing\nactive learning algorithms, especially in the context of deep Bayesian active\nmodels, rely heavily on the quality of uncertainty estimations of the model.\nHowever, such uncertainty estimates could be heavily biased, especially with\nlimited and imbalanced training data. In this paper, we propose BALanCe, a\nBayesian deep active learning framework that mitigates the effect of such\nbiases. Concretely, BALanCe employs a novel acquisition function which\nleverages the structure captured by equivalence hypothesis classes and\nfacilitates differentiation among different equivalence classes. Intuitively,\neach equivalence class consists of instantiations of deep models with similar\npredictions, and BALanCe adaptively adjusts the size of the equivalence classes\nas learning progresses. Besides the fully sequential setting, we further\npropose Batch-BALanCe -- a generalization of the sequential algorithm to the\nbatched setting -- to efficiently select batches of training examples that are\njointly effective for model improvement. We show that Batch-BALanCe achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets for active learning,\nand that both algorithms can effectively handle realistic challenges that often\ninvolve multi-class and imbalanced data.",

    "abstract": "We propose and analyze an unfitted finite element method for solving elliptic\nproblems on domains with curved boundaries and interfaces. The approximation\nspace on the whole domain is obtained by the direct extension of the finite\nelement space defined on interior elements, in the sense that there is no\ndegree of freedom locating in boundary/interface elements. The boundary/jump\nconditions are imposed in a weak sense in the scheme. The method is shown to be\nstable without any mesh adjustment or any special stabilization. Optimal\nconvergence rates under the $L^2$ norm and the energy norm are derived.\nNumerical results in both two and three dimensions are presented to illustrate\nthe accuracy and the robustness of the method.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, due to the high availability of electronic documents through\nthe Web, the plagiarism has become a serious challenge, especially among\nscholars.

    "title": "Improving the Performance of Backward Chained Behavior Trees using  Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "In this letter we show how to improve the performance of backward chained\nbehavior trees (BTs) using reinforcement learning (RL). BTs represent a\nhierarchical and modular way of combining control policies into higher level\ncontrol policies. Backward chaining is a design principle that leads to BTs\nthat combine reactivity with goal directed actions in a structured way. The\nbackward chained structure has also enabled convergence proofs for BTs,\nidentifying a set of local conditions that lead to the convergence of all\ntrajectories to a set of desired goal states. The key idea of this letter is to\nimprove performance of backward chained BTs by using the conditions identified\nin the theoretical convergence proof to setup RL problems for individual\ncontrollers. In particular, the analysis identified important subgoals,\nso-called active constraint conditions (ACCs), that should be preserved in\norder to avoid having to go back and address them again. We propose to setup\nthe RL problems to not only achieve each immediate subgoal, but also avoid\nviolating the identified ACCs. The resulting performance improvement can be\nseen to depend on how often ACC violations occured before the update, and how\nmuch effort was needed to re-achieve them. The proposed approach is illustrated\nin a dynamic simulation environment.",

    "title": "SAME: Scenario Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts for Promotion-Aware  Click-Through Rate Prediction",
    "abstract": "Promotions are becoming more important and prevalent in e-commerce platforms\nto attract customers and boost sales. However, Click-Through Rate (CTR)\nprediction methods in recommender systems are not able to handle such\ncircumstances well since: 1) they can't generalize well to serving because the\nonline data distribution is uncertain due to the potentially upcoming\npromotions; 2) without paying enough attention to scenario signals, they are\nincapable of learning different feature representation patterns which coexist\nin each scenario. In this work, we propose Scenario Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts\n(SAME), a simple yet effective model that serves both promotion and normal\nscenarios. Technically, it follows the idea of Mixture-of-Experts by adopting\nmultiple experts to learn feature representations, which are modulated by a\nFeature Gated Network (FGN) via an attention mechanism. To obtain high-quality\nrepresentations, we design a Stacked Parallel Attention Unit (SPAU) to help\neach expert better handle user behavior sequence. To tackle the distribution\nuncertainty, a set of scenario signals are elaborately devised from a\nperspective of time series prediction and fed into the FGN, whose output is\nconcatenated with feature representation from each expert to learn the\nattention. Accordingly, a mixture of the feature representations is obtained\nscenario-adaptively and used for the final CTR prediction. In this way, each\nexpert can learn a discriminative representation pattern. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study for promotion-aware CTR prediction.\nExperimental results on real-world datasets validate the superiority of SAME.\nOnline A/B test also shows SAME achieves significant gains of 3.58% on CTR and\n5.94% on IPV during promotion periods as well as 3.93% and 6.57% in normal\ndays, respectively.",

    "title": "Conversion Rate Prediction via Meta Learning in Small-Scale  Recommendation Scenarios",
    "abstract": "Different from large-scale platforms such as Taobao and Amazon, developing\nCVR models in small-scale recommendation scenarios is more challenging due to\nthe severe Data Distribution Fluctuation (DDF) issue. DDF prevents existing CVR\nmodels from being effective since 1) several months of data are needed to train\nCVR models sufficiently in small scenarios, leading to considerable\ndistribution discrepancy between training and online serving; and 2) e-commerce\npromotions have much more significant impacts on small scenarios, leading to\ndistribution uncertainty of the upcoming time period. In this work, we propose\na novel CVR method named MetaCVR from a perspective of meta learning to address\nthe DDF issue. Firstly, a base CVR model which consists of a Feature\nRepresentation Network (FRN) and output layers is elaborately designed and\ntrained sufficiently with samples across months. Then we treat time periods\nwith different data distributions as different occasions and obtain positive\nand negative prototypes for each occasion using the corresponding samples and\nthe pre-trained FRN. Subsequently, a Distance Metric Network (DMN) is devised\nto calculate the distance metrics between each sample and all prototypes to\nfacilitate mitigating the distribution uncertainty. At last, we develop an\nEnsemble Prediction Network (EPN) which incorporates the output of FRN and DMN\nto make the final CVR prediction. In this stage, we freeze the FRN and train\nthe DMN and EPN with samples from recent time period, therefore effectively\neasing the distribution discrepancy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst study of CVR prediction targeting the DDF issue in small-scale\nrecommendation scenarios. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate\nthe superiority of our MetaCVR and online A/B test also shows our model\nachieves impressive gains of 11.92% on PCVR and 8.64% on GMV.",

We introduce a novel safe route planning problem and develop an\nefficient solution to ensure the travelers' safety on roads.

Our approach finds the safest\nroutes within a user-specified distance threshold based on the personalized\ntravel experience of the knowledgeable crowd without involving any centralized\ncomputation. We develop a privacy-preserving model to quantify the travel\nexperience of a user into personalized safety scores. Our algorithms for\nfinding the safest route further enhance user privacy by minimizing the\nexposure of personalized safety scores with others. Our safe route planner can\nfind the safest routes for individuals and groups by considering both a fixed\nand a set of flexible destination locations. Extensive experiments using real\ndatasets show that our approach finds the safest route in seconds with 47% less\nexposure of personalized safety scores.",

The\nresulting composite dataset enables training a single semantic segmentation\nmodel that functions effectively across domains and generalizes to datasets\nthat were not seen during training.

Understanding the reliability and\ncertainty of transformer model predictions is crucial for building trustable\nmachine learning applications, e.g., medical diagnosis. Although many recent\ntransformer extensions have been proposed, the study of the uncertainty\nestimation of transformer models is under-explored. In this work, we propose a\nnovel way to enable transformers to have the capability of uncertainty\nestimation and, meanwhile, retain the original predictive performance. This is\nachieved by learning a hierarchical stochastic self-attention that attends to\nvalues and a set of learnable centroids, respectively.

Furthermore, this study\ninvestigates which socio-economic characteristics (e.g. employment status,\nnumber of residents) are prevalent within single clusters and, consequently,\ncan be linked to the shape of the cluster's barycenters.

    "title": "Degree-of-Freedom of Modulating Information in the Phases of  Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the information theoretical limit of a reconfigurable\nintelligent surface (RIS) aided communication scenario in which the RIS and the\ntransmitter either jointly or independently send information to the receiver.\nThe RIS is an emerging technology that uses a large number of passive\nreflective elements with adjustable phases to intelligently reflect the\ntransmit signal to the intended receiver. While most previous studies of the\nRIS focus on its ability to beamform and to boost the received signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR), this paper shows that if the information data stream is also\navailable at the RIS and can be modulated through the adjustable phases at the\nRIS, significant improvement in the {degree-of-freedom} (DoF) of the overall\nchannel is possible. For example, for an RIS system in which the signals are\nreflected from a transmitter with $M$ antennas to a receiver with $K$ antennas\nthrough an RIS with $N$ reflective elements, assuming no direct path between\nthe transmitter and the receiver, joint transmission of the transmitter and the\nRIS can achieve a DoF of $\\min(M+\\frac{N}{2}-\\frac{1}{2},N,K)$ as compared to\nthe DoF of $\\min(M,K)$ for the conventional multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) channel. This result is obtained by establishing a connection between\nthe RIS system and the MIMO channel with phase noises and by using results for\ncharacterizing the information dimension under projection. The result is\nfurther extended to the case with a direct path between the transmitter and the\nreceiver, and also to the multiple access scenario, in which the transmitter\nand the RIS send independent information. Finally, this paper proposes a\nsymbol-level precoding approach for modulating data through the phases of the\nRIS, and provides numerical simulation results to verify the theoretical DoF\nresults.",

Ranking across ports achieves precision\nover 0.94 with low false positive rates in the top ranked alerts. When deployed\non the university networks, PORTFILER detected anomalous SPM-like activity on\none of the campus networks, confirmed by the university SOC as malicious.\nPORTFILER also detected a Mirai attack recreated on the two university networks\nwith higher precision and recall than deep-learning-based autoencoder methods.",

In this\nwork, we consider two local smoothness assumptions which can help improving\ndeep image matting models.

In this framework, the\ngoal is to design estimators that minimize the worst-case expected error. Here\nthe expectation is over a known, randomized data collection process from some\npopulation, and the data values corresponding to each element of the population\nare assumed to be worst-case.\nChen, Valiant and Valiant show that, when data values are\n$\\ell_{\\infty}$-normalized, there is a polynomial time algorithm to compute an\nestimator for the mean with worst-case expected error that is within a factor\n$\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ of the optimum within the natural class of semilinear\nestimators.

Human evaluations in the form of MQM-like scorecards have\nalways been carried out in real industry setting by both clients and\ntranslation service providers (TSPs). However, traditional human translation\nquality evaluations are costly to perform and go into great linguistic detail,\nraise issues as to inter-rater reliability (IRR) and are not designed to\nmeasure quality of worse than premium quality translations. In this work, we\nintroduce HOPE, a task-oriented and human-centric evaluation framework for\nmachine translation output based on professional post-editing annotations. It\ncontains only a limited number of commonly occurring error types, and use a\nscoring model with geometric progression of error penalty points (EPPs)\nreflecting error severity level to each translation unit. The initial\nexperimental work carried out on English-Russian language pair MT outputs on\nmarketing content type of text from highly technical domain reveals that our\nevaluation framework is quite effective in reflecting the MT output quality\nregarding both overall system-level performance and segment-level transparency,\nand it increases the IRR for error type interpretation.

    "abstract": "Script Knowledge (Schank and Abelson, 1975) has long been recognized as\ncrucial for language understanding as it can help in filling in unstated\ninformation in a narrative. However, such knowledge is expensive to produce\nmanually and difficult to induce from text due to reporting bias (Gordon and\nVan Durme, 2013). In this work, we are interested in the scientific question of\nwhether explicit script knowledge is present and accessible through pre-trained\ngenerative language models (LMs). To this end, we introduce the task of\ngenerating full event sequence descriptions (ESDs) given a scenario in the form\nof natural language prompts. In zero-shot probing experiments, we find that\ngenerative LMs produce poor ESDs with mostly omitted, irrelevant, repeated or\nmisordered events. To address this, we propose a pipeline-based script\ninduction framework (SIF) which can generate good quality ESDs for unseen\nscenarios (e.g., bake a cake). SIF is a two-staged framework that fine-tunes LM\non a small set of ESD examples in the first stage. In the second stage, ESD\ngenerated for an unseen scenario is post-processed using RoBERTa-based models\nto filter irrelevant events, remove repetitions, and reorder the temporally\nmisordered events. Through automatic and manual evaluations, we demonstrate\nthat SIF yields substantial improvements ($1$-$3$ BLUE points) over a\nfine-tuned LM. However, manual analysis shows that there is great room for\nimprovement, offering a new research direction for inducing script knowledge.",

However, not all distributional shifts are equally severe,\ne.g., suppose no best arm switches occur, then we cannot rule out that a regret\n$O(\\sqrt{T})$ may remain possible; in other words, is it possible to achieve\ndynamic regret that optimally scales only with an unknown number of severe\nshifts? This unfortunately has remained elusive, despite various attempts (Auer\net al., 2019, Foster et al., 2020).\nWe resolve this problem in the case of two-armed bandits: we derive an\nadaptive procedure that guarantees a dynamic regret of order\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\tilde{L} T})$, where $\\tilde L \\ll L$ captures an unknown\nnumber of severe best arm changes, i.e., with significant switches in rewards,\nand which last sufficiently long to actually require a restart. As a\nconsequence, for any number $L$ of distributional shifts outside of these\nsevere shifts, our procedure achieves regret just $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})\\ll\n\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{LT})$.\nFinally, we note that our notion of severe shift applies in both classical\nsettings of stochastic switching bandits and of adversarial bandits.",

    "abstract": "Viscous shocks are a particular type of extreme events in nonlinear\nmultiscale systems, and their representation requires small scales. Model\nreduction can thus play an important role in reducing the computational cost\nfor an efficient prediction of shocks. Yet, reduced models typically aim to\napproximate large-scale dominating dynamics, which do not resolve the small\nscales by design. To resolve this representation barrier, we introduce a new\nqualitative characterization of the space-time locations of shocks, named as\nthe ``shock trace'', via a space-time indicator function based on an empirical\nresolution-adaptive threshold. Different from the exact shocks, the shock\ntraces can be captured within the representation capacity of the large scales,\nwhich facilitates the forecast of the timing and locations of the shocks\nutilizing reduced models. Within the context of a viscous stochastic Burgers\nequation, we show that a data-driven reduced model, in the form of nonlinear\nautoregression (NAR) time series models, can accurately predict the random\nshock traces, with relatively low rates of false predictions. The NAR model\nsignificantly outperforms the corresponding Galerkin truncated model in the\nscenario of either noiseless or noisy observations. The results illustrate the\nimportance of the data-driven closure terms in the NAR model, which account for\nthe effects of the unresolved small scale dynamics on the resolved ones due to\nnonlinear interactions.",

    "title": "From Bit-Parallelism to Quantum: Breaking the Quadratic Barrier",
    "abstract": "Many problems that can be solved in quadratic time have bit-parallel\nspeed-ups with factor $w$, where $w$ is the computer word size. For example,\nedit distance of two strings of length $n$ can be solved in $O(n^2/w)$ time. In\na reasonable classical model of computation, one can assume $w=\\Theta(\\log n)$.\nThere are conditional lower bounds for such problems stating that speed-ups\nwith factor $n^\\epsilon$ for any $\\epsilon>0$ would lead to breakthroughs in\ncomplexity theory. However, these conditional lower bounds do not cover quantum\nmodels of computing. Moreover, it is open if problems like edit distance can be\nsolved in truly sub-quadratic time using quantum computing. To partially\naddress this question, we study another bit-parallel algorithm for a problem\nthat admits a quadratic conditional lower bound, and show how to convert its\nbit-parallelism into a realistic quantum algorithm that attains speed-up with\nfactor $n$. The technique we use is simple and general enough to apply to many\nsimilar bit-parallel algorithms, where dependencies are local. However, it does\nnot immediately yield a faster algorithm for more complex problems like edit\ndistance, whose bit-parallel dynamic programming solutions require breaking\nmore global dependencies. We hope that this initial study sheds some light on\nhow, in general, bit-parallelism could be converted to quantum parallelism.",

    "title": "A machine learning pipeline for autonomous numerical analytic  continuation of Dyson-Schwinger equations",
    "abstract": "Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs) are a non-perturbative way to express\nn-point functions in quantum field theory. Working in Euclidean space and in\nLandau gauge, for example, one can study the quark propagator Dyson-Schwinger\nequation in the real and complex domain, given that a suitable and tractable\ntruncation has been found. When aiming for solving these equations in the\ncomplex domain, that is, for complex external momenta, one has to deform the\nintegration contour of the radial component in the complex plane of the loop\nmomentum expressed in hyper-spherical coordinates. This has to be done in order\nto avoid poles and branch cuts in the integrand of the self-energy loop. Since\nthe nature of Dyson-Schwinger equations is such, that they have to be solved in\na self-consistent way, one cannot analyze the analytic properties of the\nintegrand after every iteration step, as this would not be feasible. In these\nproceedings, we suggest a machine learning pipeline based on deep learning (DL)\napproaches to computer vision (CV), as well as deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL), that could solve this problem autonomously by detecting poles and branch\ncuts in the numerical integrand after every iteration step and by suggesting\nsuitable integration contour deformations that avoid these obstructions. We\nsketch out a proof of principle for both of these tasks, that is, the pole and\nbranch cut detection, as well as the contour deformation.",

In this paper, we\nprovide upper and lower bounds on the combinatorial diameter of a random\n\"spherical\" polytope, which is tight to within one factor of dimension when the\nnumber of inequalities is large compared to the dimension. More precisely, for\nan $n$-dimensional polytope $P$ defined by the intersection of $m$ i.i.d.\\\nhalf-spaces whose normals are chosen uniformly from the sphere, we show that\n$\\operatorname{diam}(P)$ is $\\Omega(n m^{\\frac{1}{n-1}})$ and $O(n^2\nm^{\\frac{1}{n-1}} + n^5 4^n)$ with high probability when $m \\geq\n2^{\\Omega(n)}$.\nFor the upper bound, we first prove that the number of vertices in any fixed\ntwo dimensional projection sharply concentrates around its expectation when $m$\nis large, where we rely on the $\\Theta(n^2 m^{\\frac{1}{n-1}})$ bound on the\nexpectation due to Borgwardt [Math.

The main\nchallenges lie in the generalizability to a variety of scanners and imaging\nprotocols. In this paper, we explore strategies to increase model robustness\nwithout increasing inference time. Towards this aim, we explore finding a\nrobust ensemble from models trained using different losses, optimizers, and\ntrain-validation data split. Importantly, we explore the inclusion of a\ntransformer in the bottleneck of the U-Net architecture. While we find\ntransformer in the bottleneck performs slightly worse than the baseline U-Net\nin average, the generalized Wasserstein Dice loss consistently produces\nsuperior results. Further, we adopt an efficient test time augmentation\nstrategy for faster and robust inference. Our final ensemble of seven 3D U-Nets\nwith test-time augmentation produces an average dice score of 89.4% and an\naverage Hausdorff 95% distance of 10.0 mm when evaluated on the BraTS 2021\ntesting dataset.

We begin by proving lower bounds that establish baselines on both\nthe deterministic error and stochastic error in this problem. In particular, we\nprove an oracle complexity lower bound on the deterministic error in an\ninstance-dependent norm associated with the stationary distribution of the\ntransition kernel, and use the local asymptotic minimax machinery to prove an\ninstance-dependent lower bound on the stochastic error in the i.i.d.\nobservation model.

To remedy this issue, we develop an accelerated,\nvariance-reduced fast temporal difference algorithm (VRFTD) that simultaneously\nmatches both lower bounds and attains a strong notion of instance-optimality.\nFinally, we extend the VRFTD algorithm to the setting with Markovian\nobservations, and provide instance-dependent convergence results that match\nthose in the i.i.d. setting up to a multiplicative factor that is proportional\nto the mixing time of the chain.

    "abstract": "Ultrasonography offers an inexpensive, widely-accessible and compact medical\nimaging solution. However, compared to other imaging modalities such as CT and\nMRI, ultrasound images notoriously suffer from strong speckle noise, which\noriginates from the random interference of sub-wavelength scattering. This\ndeteriorates ultrasound image quality and makes interpretation challenging. We\nhere propose a new unsupervised ultrasound speckle reduction and image\ndenoising method based on maximum-a-posteriori estimation with deep generative\npriors that are learned from high-quality MRI images. To model the generative\ntissue reflectivity prior, we exploit normalizing flows, which in recent years\nhave shown to be very powerful in modeling signal priors across a variety of\napplications. To facilitate generaliation, we factorize the prior and train our\nflow model on patches from the NYU fastMRI (fully-sampled) dataset. This prior\nis then used for inference in an iterative denoising scheme. We first validate\nthe utility of our learned priors on noisy MRI data (no prior domain shift),\nand then turn to evaluating performance on both simulated and in-vivo\nultrasound images from the PICMUS and CUBDL datasets. The results show that the\nmethod outperforms other (unsupervised) ultrasound denoising methods (NLM and\nOBNLM) both quantitatively and qualitatively.",

As state-of-the-art neural networks for processing the\nresulting image data are computationally demanding, there has been growing\ninterest in leveraging fifth generation (5G) wireless connectivity and mobile\nedge computing for offloading this processing to the cloud. To assess this\npossibility, this paper presents a detailed simulation and evaluation of 5G\nwireless offloading for object detection within a powerful, new smart wearable\ncalled VIS4ION, for the Blind-and-Visually Impaired (BVI). The current VIS4ION\nsystem is an instrumented book-bag with high-resolution cameras, vision\nprocessing and haptic and audio feedback. The paper considers uploading the\ncamera data to a mobile edge cloud to perform real-time object detection and\ntransmitting the detection results back to the wearable. To determine the video\nrequirements, the paper evaluates the impact of video bit rate and resolution\non object detection accuracy and range.

    "abstract": "Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been identified as a viable\nmethod for determining the importance of features when making predictions using\nMachine Learning (ML) models. In this study, we created models that take an\nindividual's health information (e.g. their drug history and comorbidities) as\ninputs, and predict the probability that the individual will have an Acute\nCoronary Syndrome (ACS) adverse outcome. Using XAI, we quantified the\ncontribution that specific drugs had on these ACS predictions, thus creating an\nXAI-based technique for pharmacovigilance monitoring, using ACS as an example\nof the adverse outcome to detect. Individuals aged over 65 who were supplied\nMusculo-skeletal system (anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) class M) or\nCardiovascular system (ATC class C) drugs between 1993 and 2009 were\nidentified, and their drug histories, comorbidities, and other key features\nwere extracted from linked Western Australian datasets. Multiple ML models were\ntrained to predict if these individuals would have an ACS related adverse\noutcome (i.e., death or hospitalisation with a discharge diagnosis of ACS), and\na variety of ML and XAI techniques were used to calculate which features --\nspecifically which drugs -- led to these predictions. The drug dispensing\nfeatures for rofecoxib and celecoxib were found to have a greater than zero\ncontribution to ACS related adverse outcome predictions (on average), and it\nwas found that ACS related adverse outcomes can be predicted with 72% accuracy.\nFurthermore, the XAI libraries LIME and SHAP were found to successfully\nidentify both important and unimportant features, with SHAP slightly\noutperforming LIME. ML models trained on linked administrative health datasets\nin tandem with XAI algorithms can successfully quantify feature importance, and\nwith further development, could potentially be used as pharmacovigilance\nmonitoring techniques.",

    "abstract": "Although equirectangular projection (ERP) is a convenient form to store\nomnidirectional images (also known as 360-degree images), it is neither\nequal-area nor conformal, thus not friendly to subsequent visual communication.\nIn the context of image compression, ERP will over-sample and deform things and\nstuff near the poles, making it difficult for perceptually optimal bit\nallocation. In conventional 360-degree image compression, techniques such as\nregion-wise packing and tiled representation are introduced to alleviate the\nover-sampling problem, achieving limited success. In this paper, we make one of\nthe first attempts to learn deep neural networks for omnidirectional image\ncompression. We first describe parametric pseudocylindrical representation as a\ngeneralization of common pseudocylindrical map projections. A computationally\ntractable greedy method is presented to determine the (sub)-optimal\nconfiguration of the pseudocylindrical representation in terms of a novel proxy\nobjective for rate-distortion performance. We then propose pseudocylindrical\nconvolutions for 360-degree image compression. Under reasonable constraints on\nthe parametric representation, the pseudocylindrical convolution can be\nefficiently implemented by standard convolution with the so-called\npseudocylindrical padding. To demonstrate the feasibility of our idea, we\nimplement an end-to-end 360-degree image compression system, consisting of the\nlearned pseudocylindrical representation, an analysis transform, a non-uniform\nquantizer, a synthesis transform, and an entropy model. Experimental results on\n$19,790$ omnidirectional images show that our method achieves consistently\nbetter rate-distortion performance than the competing methods. Moreover, the\nvisual quality by our method is significantly improved for all images at all\nbitrates.",

Thus, in contrast to the majority of existing\nmethods, FRSD does not employ a gradient tracking technique, rather it uses a\nnovel momentum term. Under the assumption that each node-specific function is\nsmooth and strongly convex, we show that FRSD admits constant step-size and\nmomentum parameters such that the iterate sequence converges linearly to the\noptimal consensus solution.

    "abstract": "The use of mathematical models to make predictions about tumor growth and\nresponse to treatment has become increasingly more prevalent in the clinical\nsetting. The level of complexity within these models ranges broadly, and the\ncalibration of more complex models correspondingly requires more detailed\nclinical data. This raises questions about how much data should be collected\nand when, in order to minimize the total amount of data used and the time until\na model can be calibrated accurately. To address these questions, we propose a\nBayesian information-theoretic procedure, using a gradient-based score function\nto determine the optimal data collection times for model calibration. The novel\nscore function introduced in this work eliminates the need for a weight\nparameter used in a previous study's score function, while still yielding\naccurate and efficient model calibration using even fewer scans on a sample set\nof synthetic data, simulating tumors of varying levels of radiosensitivity. We\nalso conduct a robust analysis of the calibration accuracy and certainty, using\nboth error and uncertainty metrics. Unlike the error analysis of the previous\nstudy, the inclusion of uncertainty analysis in this work|as a means for\ndeciding when the algorithm can be terminated|provides a more realistic option\nfor clinical decision-making, since it does not rely on data that will be\ncollected later in time.",

This\npaper considers quantum analogues of pseudo-spectral (PS) methods on classical\ncomputers. Estimates on the gate counts in terms of $\\hbar$ and the precision\n$\\varepsilon$ are obtained.

    "abstract": "The accuracy of binary classification systems is defined as the proportion of\ncorrect predictions - both positive and negative - made by a classification\nmodel or computational algorithm. A value between 0 (no accuracy) and 1\n(perfect accuracy), the accuracy of a classification model is dependent on\nseveral factors, notably: the classification rule or algorithm used, the\nintrinsic characteristics of the tool used to do the classification, and the\nrelative frequency of the elements being classified. Several accuracy metrics\nexist, each with its own advantages in different classification scenarios. In\nthis manuscript, we show that relative to a perfect accuracy of 1, the positive\nprevalence threshold ($\\phi_e$), a critical point of maximum curvature in the\nprecision-prevalence curve, bounds the $F{_{\\beta}}$ score between 1 and\n1.8/1.5/1.2 for $\\beta$ values of 0.5/1.0/2.0, respectively; the $F_1$ score\nbetween 1 and 1.5, and the Fowlkes-Mallows Index (FM) between 1 and $\\sqrt{2}\n\\approx 1.414$. We likewise describe a novel $negative$ prevalence threshold\n($\\phi_n$), the level of sharpest curvature for the negative predictive\nvalue-prevalence curve, such that $\\phi_n$ $>$ $\\phi_e$. The area between both\nthese thresholds bounds the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) between\n$\\sqrt{2}/2$ and $\\sqrt{2}$. Conversely, the ratio of the maximum possible\naccuracy to that at any point below the prevalence threshold, $\\phi_e$, goes to\ninfinity with decreasing prevalence. Though applications are numerous, the\nideas herein discussed may be used in computational complexity theory,\nartificial intelligence, and medical screening, amongst others. Where\ncomputational time is a limiting resource, attaining the prevalence threshold\nin binary classification systems may be sufficient to yield levels of accuracy\ncomparable to that under maximum prevalence.",

The target application of AIDA is to propose\non-the-spot the most interesting alternative values for the tuning parameters\nof a hearing aid (HA) algorithm, whenever a HA client is not satisfied with\ntheir HA performance. AIDA interprets searching for the \"most interesting\nalternative\" as an issue of optimal (acoustic) context-aware Bayesian trial\ndesign. In computational terms, AIDA is realized as an active inference-based\nagent with an Expected Free Energy criterion for trial design. This type of\narchitecture is inspired by neuro-economic models on efficient (Bayesian) trial\ndesign in brains and implies that AIDA comprises generative probabilistic\nmodels for acoustic signals and user responses. We propose a novel generative\nmodel for acoustic signals as a sum of time-varying auto-regressive filters and\na user response model based on a Gaussian Process Classifier. The full AIDA\nagent has been implemented in a factor graph for the generative model and all\ntasks (parameter learning, acoustic context classification, trial design, etc.)\nare realized by variational message passing on the factor graph. All\nverification and validation experiments and demonstrations are freely\naccessible at our GitHub repository.",

    "title": "A Trained Regularization Approach Based on Born Iterative Method for  Electromagnetic Imaging",
    "abstract": "A trained-based Born iterative method (TBIM) is developed for electromagnetic\nimaging (EMI) applications. The proposed TBIM consists of a nested loop; the\nouter loop executes TBIM iteration steps, while the inner loop executes a\ntrained iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (TISTA). The applied TISTA\nruns linear Landweber iterations implemented with a trained regularization\nnetwork designed based on U-net architecture. A normalization process was\nimposed in TISTA that made TISTA training applicable within the proposed TBIM.\nThe iterative utilization of the regularization network in TISTA is a\nbottleneck that demands high memory allocation through the training process.\nTherefore TISTA within each TBIM step was trained separately. The TISTA\nregularization network in each TBIM step was initialized using the weights from\nthe previous TBIM step. The above approach achieved high-quality image\nrestoration after running few TBIM steps while maintained low memory allocation\nthrough the training process. The proposed framework can be extended to Newton\nor quasi-Newton schemes, where within each Newton iteration, a linear ill-posed\nproblem is optimized that differs from one example to another. The numerical\nresults illustrated in this work show the superiority of the proposed TBIM\ncompared to the conventional sparse-based Born iterative method (SBIM).",

    "title": "Omitted Variable Bias in Machine Learned Causal Models",
    "abstract": "We derive general, yet simple, sharp bounds on the size of the omitted\nvariable bias for a broad class of causal parameters that can be identified as\nlinear functionals of the conditional expectation function of the outcome. Such\nfunctionals encompass many of the traditional targets of investigation in\ncausal inference studies, such as, for example, (weighted) average of potential\noutcomes, average treatment effects (including subgroup effects, such as the\neffect on the treated), (weighted) average derivatives, and policy effects from\nshifts in covariate distribution -- all for general, nonparametric causal\nmodels. Our construction relies on the Riesz-Frechet representation of the\ntarget functional. Specifically, we show how the bound on the bias depends only\non the additional variation that the latent variables create both in the\noutcome and in the Riesz representer for the parameter of interest. Moreover,\nin many important cases (e.g, average treatment effects in partially linear\nmodels, or in nonseparable models with a binary treatment) the bound is shown\nto depend on two easily interpretable quantities: the nonparametric partial\n$R^2$ (Pearson's \"correlation ratio\") of the unobserved variables with the\ntreatment and with the outcome. Therefore, simple plausibility judgments on the\nmaximum explanatory power of omitted variables (in explaining treatment and\noutcome variation) are sufficient to place overall bounds on the size of the\nbias. Finally, leveraging debiased machine learning, we provide flexible and\nefficient statistical inference methods to estimate the components of the\nbounds that are identifiable from the observed distribution.",

By taking the\ndelay spread and time-synchronization errors into account, the MV at the ES is\nobtained with an energy detector. Hence, the proposed scheme does not require\nCSI at the EDs and ES. We also prove the convergence of the distributed\ntraining when the MV is obtained with the proposed scheme under fading channel.\nThrough simulations, we show that the proposed scheme provides a high test\naccuracy in fading channels while resulting in lower peak-to-mean envelope\npower ratio (PMEPR) symbols.",

    "abstract": "CT and MRI are two widely used clinical imaging modalities for non-invasive\ndiagnosis. However, both of these modalities come with certain problems. CT\nuses harmful ionising radiation, and MRI suffers from slow acquisition speed.\nBoth problems can be tackled by undersampling, such as sparse sampling.\nHowever, such undersampled data leads to lower resolution and introduces\nartefacts. Several techniques, including deep learning based methods, have been\nproposed to reconstruct such data. However, the undersampled reconstruction\nproblem for these two modalities was always considered as two different\nproblems and tackled separately by different research works. This paper\nproposes a unified solution for both sparse CT and undersampled radial MRI\nreconstruction, achieved by applying Fourier transform-based pre-processing on\nthe radial MRI and then reconstructing both modalities using sinogram\nupsampling combined with filtered back-projection. The Primal-Dual network is a\ndeep learning based method for reconstructing sparsely-sampled CT data. This\npaper introduces Primal-Dual UNet, which improves the Primal-Dual network in\nterms of accuracy and reconstruction speed. The proposed method resulted in an\naverage SSIM of 0.932 while performing sparse CT reconstruction for fan-beam\ngeometry with a sparsity level of 16, achieving a statistically significant\nimprovement over the previous model, which resulted in 0.919. Furthermore, the\nproposed model resulted in 0.903 and 0.957 average SSIM while reconstructing\nundersampled brain and abdominal MRI data with an acceleration factor of 16 -\nstatistically significant improvements over the original model, which resulted\nin 0.867 and 0.949. Finally, this paper shows that the proposed network not\nonly improves the overall image quality, but also improves the image quality\nfor the regions-of-interest; as well as generalises better in presence of a\nneedle.",

    "abstract": "In this study we introduce a new class of experimental designs. In a\nclassical randomized controlled trial (RCT), or A/B test, a randomly selected\nsubset of a population of units (e.g., individuals, plots of land, or\nexperiences) is assigned to a treatment (treatment A), and the remainder of the\npopulation is assigned to the control treatment (treatment B). The difference\nin average outcome by treatment group is an estimate of the average effect of\nthe treatment. However, motivating our study, the setting for modern\nexperiments is often different, with the outcomes and treatment assignments\nindexed by multiple populations. For example, outcomes may be indexed by buyers\nand sellers, by content creators and subscribers, by drivers and riders, or by\ntravelers and airlines and travel agents, with treatments potentially varying\nacross these indices. Spillovers or interference can arise from interactions\nbetween units across populations. For example, sellers' behavior may depend on\nbuyers' treatment assignment, or vice versa. This can invalidate the simple\ncomparison of means as an estimator for the average effect of the treatment in\nclassical RCTs. We propose new experiment designs for settings in which\nmultiple populations interact. We show how these designs allow us to study\nquestions about interference that cannot be answered by classical randomized\nexperiments.

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is one of the most malignant cancers in the world, which\ndeteriorates rapidly with very high mortality. The rapid on-site evaluation\n(ROSE) technique innovates the workflow by immediately analyzing the fast\nstained cytopathological images with on-site pathologists, which enables faster\ndiagnosis in this time-pressured process. However, the wider expansion of ROSE\ndiagnosis has been hindered by the lack of experienced pathologists. To\novercome this problem, we propose a hybrid high-performance deep learning model\nto enable the automated workflow, thus freeing the occupation of the valuable\ntime of pathologists. By firstly introducing the Transformer block into this\nfield with our particular multi-stage hybrid design, the spatial features\ngenerated by the convolutional neural network (CNN) significantly enhance the\nTransformer global modeling. Turning multi-stage spatial features as global\nattention guidance, this design combines the robustness from the inductive bias\nof CNN with the sophisticated global modeling power of Transformer. A dataset\nof 4240 ROSE images is collected to evaluate the method in this unexplored\nfield. The proposed multi-stage hybrid Transformer (MSHT) achieves 95.68% in\nclassification accuracy, which is distinctively higher than the\nstate-of-the-art models. Facing the need for interpretability, MSHT outperforms\nits counterparts with more accurate attention regions. The results demonstrate\nthat the MSHT can distinguish cancer samples accurately at an unprecedented\nimage scale, laying the foundation for deploying automatic decision systems and\nenabling the expansion of ROSE in clinical practice.

It is one of the non-communicable\ndiseases (NCDs) and NCDs accounts for 71% of total deaths worldwide whereas\nlung cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer after female breast cancer.\nCancer survival rate of lung cancer is only 19%. There are various methods for\nthe diagnosis of lung cancer, such as X-ray, CT scan, PET-CT scan, bronchoscopy\nand biopsy.

Studies have reported that the type of histology is\nassociated with prognosis and treatment in lung cancer. Therefore, early and\naccurate detection of lung cancer histology is an urgent need and as its\ntreatment is dependent on the type of histology, molecular profile and stage of\nthe disease, it is most essential to analyse the histopathology images of lung\ncancer. Hence, to speed up the vital process of diagnosis of lung cancer and\nreduce the burden on pathologists, Deep learning techniques are used.

However, with the urgent demand for intelligent\nsystems, the training of multiple tasks with over-the-air computation further\naggravates the scarcity of communication resources.

In this paper, we study over-the-air multi-task FL\n(OA-MTFL) over the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channel.\nWe propose a novel model aggregation method for the alignment of local\ngradients for different devices, which alleviates the straggler problem that\nexists widely in over-the-air computation due to the channel heterogeneity. We\nestablish a unified communication-computation analysis framework for the\nproposed OA-MTFL scheme by considering the spatial correlation between devices,\nand formulate an optimization problem of designing transceiver beamforming and\ndevice selection. We develop an algorithm by using alternating optimization\n(AO) and fractional programming (FP) to solve this problem, which effectively\nrelieves the impact of inter-task interference on the FL learning performance.\nWe show that due to the use of the new model aggregation method, device\nselection is no longer essential to our scheme, thereby avoiding the heavy\ncomputational burden caused by implementing device selection.

    "abstract": "Translational brain research using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is\nbecoming increasingly popular as animal models are an essential part of\nscientific studies and ultra-high-field scanners become more available. Some\ndrawbacks of MRI are MRI scanner availability, and the time needed to perform a\nfull scanning session (it usually takes over 30 minutes). Data protection laws\nand 3R ethical rule also make it difficult to create large data sets for\ntraining Deep Learning models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been\nshown capable of performing data augmentation with higher quality than other\ntechniques. In this work, the alpha-GAN architecture is used to test its\nability to generate realistic 3D MRI scans of the rat brain. As far as the\nauthors are aware, this is the first time an approach based on GANs is used for\ndata augmentation in preclinical data. The generated scans are evaluated using\nvarious qualitative and quantitative metrics. A Turing test performed by 4\nexperts has shown that the generated scans can trick almost any expert. The\ngenerated scans were also used to evaluate their impact on the performance of\nan existing deep learning model developed for rat brain segmentation of white\nmatter, grey matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. The models were compared using\nthe Dice score. The best results for the segmentation of whole brain and white\nmatter were achieved when 174 real scans and 348 synthetic ones were used, with\nimprovements of 0.0172 and 0.0129. The use of 174 real scans and 87 synthetic\nones led to improvements of 0.0038 and 0.0764 of grey matter and cerebrospinal\nfluid segmentation. Thus, by using the proposed new normalisation layer and\nloss functions, it was possible to improve the realism of the generated rat MRI\nscans and it was demonstrated that using the data generated improved the\nsegmentation model more than using conventional data augmentation.",

    "abstract": "Classifying SPECT images requires a preprocessing step which normalizes the\nimages using a normalization region. The choice of the normalization region is\nnot standard, and using different normalization regions introduces\nnormalization region-dependent variability. This paper mathematically analyzes\nthe effect of the normalization region to show that normalized-classification\nis exactly equivalent to a subspace separation of the half rays of the images\nunder multiplicative equivalence. Using this geometry, a new self-normalized\nclassification strategy is proposed. This strategy eliminates the normalizing\nregion altogether. The theory is used to classify DaTscan images of 365\nParkinson's disease (PD) subjects and 208 healthy control (HC) subjects from\nthe Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI). The theory is also used\nto understand PD progression from baseline to year 4.",

    "title": "Computationally Efficient Approximations for Matrix-based Renyi's  Entropy",
    "abstract": "The recently developed matrix based Renyi's entropy enables measurement of\ninformation in data simply using the eigenspectrum of symmetric positive semi\ndefinite (PSD) matrices in reproducing kernel Hilbert space, without estimation\nof the underlying data distribution. This intriguing property makes the new\ninformation measurement widely adopted in multiple statistical inference and\nlearning tasks. However, the computation of such quantity involves the trace\noperator on a PSD matrix $G$ to power $\\alpha$(i.e., $tr(G^\\alpha)$), with a\nnormal complexity of nearly $O(n^3)$, which severely hampers its practical\nusage when the number of samples (i.e., $n$) is large. In this work, we present\ncomputationally efficient approximations to this new entropy functional that\ncan reduce its complexity to even significantly less than $O(n^2)$. To this\nend, we first develop randomized approximations to $\\tr(\\G^\\alpha)$ that\ntransform the trace estimation into matrix-vector multiplications problem. We\nextend such strategy for arbitrary values of $\\alpha$ (integer or non-integer).\nWe then establish the connection between the matrix-based Renyi's entropy and\nPSD matrix approximation, which enables us to exploit both clustering and block\nlow-rank structure of $\\G$ to further reduce the computational cost. We\ntheoretically provide approximation accuracy guarantees and illustrate the\nproperties of different approximations. Large-scale experimental evaluations on\nboth synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theoretical findings,\nshowing promising speedup with negligible loss in accuracy.",

    "abstract": "We present an analytical and experimental study of torsional magnetic\nmechanism where the restoring torque is due to magnetic field interactions\nbetween rotating and fixed permanent magnets. The oscillator consists of a ball\nbearing-supported permanent magnet, called the rotor, placed between two fixed\npermanent magnets called the stators. Perturbing the rotor from its equilibrium\nangle induces a restoring magnetic torque whose effect is modeled as a\ntorsional spring. This restoring effect is accompanied by dissipation\nmechanisms arising from structural viscoelasticity, air and electromagnetic\ndamping, as well as friction in the ball bearings. To investigate the system\ndynamics, we constructed an experimental setup capable of mechanical,\nelectrical and magnetic measurements. For various rotor-stator gaps in this\nsetup, we validated an analytical model that assumes viscous and dry (Coulomb)\ndamping during the rotor free response. Moreover, we forced the rotor by a\nneighboring electromagnetic coil into high amplitude oscillations. We observed\nunusual resonator nonlinearity: at large rotor-stator gaps, the oscillations\nare softening; at reduced gaps, the oscillations stiffen-then-soften. The\ndeveloped reduced-order models capture the nonlinear effects of the\nrotor-to-stator and the rotor-to-coil distances. These magnetic oscillators are\npromising in low-frequency electromagnetic signal transmission and in designing\nmagneto-elastic metamaterials with tailorable nonlinearity.",

    "title": "Infant Brain Age Classification: 2D CNN Outperforms 3D CNN in Small  Dataset",
    "abstract": "Determining if the brain is developing normally is a key component of\npediatric neuroradiology and neurology. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nof infants demonstrates a specific pattern of development beyond simply\nmyelination. While radiologists have used myelination patterns, brain\nmorphology and size characteristics to determine age-adequate brain maturity,\nthis requires years of experience in pediatric neuroradiology. With no\nstandardized criteria, visual estimation of the structural maturity of the\nbrain from MRI before three years of age remains dominated by inter-observer\nand intra-observer variability. A more objective estimation of brain\ndevelopmental age could help physicians identify many neurodevelopmental\nconditions and diseases earlier and more reliably. Such data, however, is\nnaturally hard to obtain, and the observer ground truth not much of a gold\nstandard due to subjectivity of assessment. In this light, we explore the\ngeneral feasibility to tackle this task, and the utility of different\napproaches, including two- and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks\n(CNN) that were trained on a fusion of T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and proton\ndensity (PD) weighted sequences from 84 individual subjects divided into four\nage groups from birth to 3 years of age. In the best performing approach, we\nachieved an accuracy of 0.90 [95% CI:0.86-0.94] using a 2D CNN on a central\naxial thick slab. We discuss the comparison to 3D networks and show how the\nperformance compares to the use of only one sequence (T1w). In conclusion,\ndespite the theoretical superiority of 3D CNN approaches, in limited-data\nsituations, such approaches are inferior to simpler architectures.

    "abstract": "In this paper we develop efficient first-order algorithms for the generalized\ntrust-region subproblem (GTRS), which has applications in signal processing,\ncompressed sensing, and engineering. Although the GTRS, as stated, is nonlinear\nand nonconvex, it is well-known that objective value exactness holds for its\nSDP relaxation under a Slater condition. While polynomial-time SDP-based\nalgorithms exist for the GTRS, their relatively large computational complexity\nhas motivated and spurred the development of custom approaches for solving the\nGTRS. In particular, recent work in this direction has developed first-order\nmethods for the GTRS whose running times are linear in the sparsity (the number\nof nonzero entries) of the input data. In contrast to these algorithms, in this\npaper we develop algorithms for computing $\\epsilon$-approximate solutions to\nthe GTRS whose running times are linear in both the input sparsity and the\nprecision $\\log(1/\\epsilon)$ whenever a regularity parameter is positive. We\ncomplement our theoretical guarantees with numerical experiments comparing our\napproach against algorithms from the literature. Our numerical experiments\nhighlight that our new algorithms significantly outperform prior\nstate-of-the-art algorithms on sparse large-scale instances.",

Using these techniques, we show that\nthe HRDE of Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent (OGDA) has last-iterate\nconvergence for general monotone variational inequalities. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first continuous-time dynamics shown to converge for such a general\nsetting.
