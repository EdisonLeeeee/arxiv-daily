    "abstract": "The pandemic has shattered the traditional enclosures of learning. The\npost-pandemic university (PPU) will no longer be contained within the 4 walls\nof a lecture theatre, and finish once students have left the premises. The use\nof online services has now blended home and university life, and the PPU needs\nto reflect this. Our proposal of a continuous learning model will take\nadvantage of the newfound omnipresence of learning, while being dynamic enough\nto continually adapt to the ever-evolving virus situation. Universities\nrestricting themselves to fixed subject themes that are then forgotten once\ncompleted, will miss out on the \"fresh start\" presented by the virus.",

    "abstract": "Air quality has a significant impact on human health. Degradation in air\nquality leads to a wide range of health issues, especially in children. The\nability to predict air quality enables the government and other concerned\norganizations to take necessary steps to shield the most vulnerable, from being\nexposed to the air with hazardous quality. Traditional approaches to this task\nhave very limited success because of a lack of access of such methods to\nsufficient longitudinal data. In this paper, we use a Support Vector Regression\n(SVR) model to forecast the levels of various pollutants and the air quality\nindex, using archive pollution data made publicly available by Central\nPollution Control Board and the US Embassy in New Delhi. Among the tested\nmethods, a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel produced the best results with\nSVR. According to our experiments, using the whole range of available variables\nproduced better results than using features selected by principal component\nanalysis. The model predicts levels of various pollutants, like, sulfur\ndioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter 2.5, and\nground-level ozone, as well as the Air Quality Index (AQI), at an accuracy of\n93.4 percent.",

    "abstract": "Objective: to provide a scoping review of papers on clinical natural language\nprocessing (NLP) tasks that use publicly available electronic health record\ndata from a cohort of patients. Materials and Methods: We searched six\ndatabases, including biomedical research and computer science literature\ndatabase. A round of title/abstract screening and full-text screening were\nconducted by two reviewers. Our method followed the Preferred Reporting Items\nfor Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: A total\nof 35 papers with 47 clinical NLP tasks met inclusion criteria between 2007 and\n2021. We categorized the tasks by the type of NLP problems, including name\nentity recognition, summarization, and other NLP tasks. Some tasks were\nintroduced with a topic of clinical decision support applications, such as\nsubstance abuse, phenotyping, cohort selection for clinical trial. We\nsummarized the tasks by publication and dataset information. Discussion: The\nbreadth of clinical NLP tasks keeps growing as the field of NLP evolves with\nadvancements in language systems. However, gaps exist in divergent interests\nbetween general domain NLP community and clinical informatics community, and in\ngeneralizability of the data sources. We also identified issues in data\nselection and preparation including the lack of time-sensitive data, and\ninvalidity of problem size and evaluation. Conclusions: The existing clinical\nNLP tasks cover a wide range of topics and the field will continue to grow and\nattract more attention from both general domain NLP and clinical informatics\ncommunity. We encourage future work to incorporate multi-disciplinary\ncollaboration, reporting transparency, and standardization in data preparation.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) involves retrieving facts from a\nKnowledge Graph (KG) using natural language queries. A KG is a curated set of\nfacts consisting of entities linked by relations. Certain facts include also\ntemporal information forming a Temporal KG (TKG). Although many natural\nquestions involve explicit or implicit time constraints, question answering\n(QA) over TKGs has been a relatively unexplored area. Existing solutions are\nmainly designed for simple temporal questions that can be answered directly by\na single TKG fact. This paper puts forth a comprehensive embedding-based\nframework for answering complex questions over TKGs. Our method termed temporal\nquestion reasoning (TempoQR) exploits TKG embeddings to ground the question to\nthe specific entities and time scope it refers to. It does so by augmenting the\nquestion embeddings with context, entity and time-aware information by\nemploying three specialized modules. The first computes a textual\nrepresentation of a given question, the second combines it with the entity\nembeddings for entities involved in the question, and the third generates\nquestion-specific time embeddings. Finally, a transformer-based encoder learns\nto fuse the generated temporal information with the question representation,\nwhich is used for answer predictions. Extensive experiments show that TempoQR\nimproves accuracy by 25--45 percentage points on complex temporal questions\nover state-of-the-art approaches and it generalizes better to unseen question\ntypes.",

    "abstract": "The increasing availability and accessibility of numerous overhead images\nallows us to estimate and assess the spatial arrangement of groups of\ngeospatial target objects, which can benefit many applications, such as traffic\nmonitoring and agricultural monitoring. Spatial arrangement estimation is the\nprocess of identifying the areas which contain the desired objects in overhead\nimages. Traditional supervised object detection approaches can estimate\naccurate spatial arrangement but require large amounts of bounding box\nannotations. Recent semi-supervised clustering approaches can reduce manual\nlabeling but still require annotations for all object categories in the image.\nThis paper presents the target-guided generative model (TGGM), under the\nVariational Auto-encoder (VAE) framework, which uses Gaussian Mixture Models\n(GMM) to estimate the distributions of both hidden and decoder variables in\nVAE. Modeling both hidden and decoder variables by GMM reduces the required\nmanual annotations significantly for spatial arrangement estimation. Unlike\nexisting approaches that the training process can only update the GMM as a\nwhole in the optimization iterations (e.g., a \"minibatch\"), TGGM allows the\nupdate of individual GMM components separately in the same optimization\niteration. Optimizing GMM components separately allows TGGM to exploit the\nsemantic relationships in spatial data and requires only a few labels to\ninitiate and guide the generative process. Our experiments shows that TGGM\nachieves results comparable to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and\noutperforms unsupervised methods by 10% based on the $F_{1}$ scores, while\nrequiring significantly fewer labeled data.",

Presenting a trustworthy\nand summarized account of the unfolding event in near real-time to the\nconsumers of such potentially unreliable information thus becomes an important\ntask. In this work, we propose MTLTS, the first end-to-end solution for the\ntask that jointly determines the credibility and summary-worthiness of tweets.\nOur credibility verifier is designed to recursively learn the structural\nproperties of a Twitter conversation cascade, along with the stances of replies\ntowards the source tweet.

Different from existing disaster-specific\nsummarizers, we model tweet summarization as a supervised task. Such an\napproach can automatically learn summary-worthy features, and can therefore\ngeneralize well across domains. When trained on the PHEME dataset [29], not\nonly do we outperform the strongest baselines for the auxiliary task of\nverification/rumour detection, we also achieve 21 - 35% gains in the verified\nratio of summary tweets, and 16 - 20% gains in ROUGE1-F1 scores over the\nexisting state-of-the-art solutions for the primary task of trustworthy\nsummarization.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent dispatching is crucial to obtaining low response times in\nlarge-scale systems. One common scalable dispatching paradigm is the\n``power-of-$d$,'' in which the dispatcher queries $d$ servers at random and\nassigns the job to a server based only on the state of the queried servers. The\nbulk of power-of-$d$ policies studied in the literature assume that the system\nis homogeneous, meaning that all servers have the same speed; meanwhile\nreal-world systems often exhibit server speed heterogeneity.\nThis paper introduces a general framework for describing and analyzing\nheterogeneity-aware power-of-$d$ policies. The key idea behind our framework is\nthat dispatching policies can make use of server speed information at two\ndecision points: when choosing which $d$ servers to query, and when assigning a\njob to one of those servers. Our framework explicitly separates the dispatching\npolicy into a querying rule and an assignment rule; we consider general\nfamilies of both rule types.\nWhile the strongest assignment rules incorporate both detailed queue-length\ninformation and server speed information, these rules typically are difficult\nto analyze. We overcome this difficulty by focusing on heterogeneity-aware\nassignment rules that ignore queue length information beyond idleness status.\nIn this setting, we analyze mean response time and formulate novel optimization\nproblems for the joint optimization of querying and assignment. We build upon\nour optimized policies to develop heuristic queue length-aware dispatching\npolicies. Our heuristic policies perform well in simulation, relative to\npolicies that have appeared in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Consistency regularization is one of the most widely-used techniques for\nsemi-supervised learning (SSL). Generally, the aim is to train a model that is\ninvariant to various data augmentations. In this paper, we revisit this idea\nand find that enforcing invariance by decreasing distances between features\nfrom differently augmented images leads to improved performance. However,\nencouraging equivariance instead, by increasing the feature distance, further\nimproves performance. To this end, we propose an improved consistency\nregularization framework by a simple yet effective technique, FeatDistLoss,\nthat imposes consistency and equivariance on the classifier and the feature\nlevel, respectively. Experimental results show that our model defines a new\nstate of the art for various datasets and settings and outperforms previous\nwork by a significant margin, particularly in low data regimes. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted to analyze the method, and the code will be\npublished.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we develop new self-learning techniques with an attention-based\nsequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model for automatic speech recognition (ASR).\nFor untranscribed speech data, the hypothesis from an ASR system must be used\nas a label. However, the imperfect ASR result makes unsupervised learning\ndifficult to consistently improve recognition performance especially in the\ncase that multiple powerful teacher models are unavailable. In contrast to\nconventional unsupervised learning approaches, we adopt the \\emph{multi-task\nlearning} (MTL) framework where the $n$-th best ASR hypothesis is used as the\nlabel of each task. The seq2seq network is updated through the MTL framework so\nas to find the common representation that can cover multiple hypotheses. By\ndoing so, the effect of the \\emph{hard-decision} errors can be alleviated.\nWe first demonstrate the effectiveness of our self-learning methods through\nASR experiments in an accent adaptation task between the US and British English\nspeech. Our experiment results show that our method can reduce the WER on the\nBritish speech data from 14.55\\% to 10.36\\% compared to the baseline model\ntrained with the US English data only.

    "abstract": "We present a quality-aware multimodal recognition framework that combines\nrepresentations from multiple biometric traits with varying quality and number\nof samples to achieve increased recognition accuracy by extracting\ncomplimentary identification information based on the quality of the samples.\nWe develop a quality-aware framework for fusing representations of input\nmodalities by weighting their importance using quality scores estimated in a\nweakly-supervised fashion. This framework utilizes two fusion blocks, each\nrepresented by a set of quality-aware and aggregation networks. In addition to\narchitecture modifications, we propose two task-specific loss functions:\nmultimodal separability loss and multimodal compactness loss. The first loss\nassures that the representations of modalities for a class have comparable\nmagnitudes to provide a better quality estimation, while the multimodal\nrepresentations of different classes are distributed to achieve maximum\ndiscrimination in the embedding space. The second loss, which is considered to\nregularize the network weights, improves the generalization performance by\nregularizing the framework. We evaluate the performance by considering three\nmultimodal datasets consisting of face, iris, and fingerprint modalities. The\nefficacy of the framework is demonstrated through comparison with the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.

By\ndoing so, they hope to reduce the number of coupons that must be sampled by\neach collector in order to obtain a full set. This extension is natural when\nconsidering real-world manifestations of the coupon collector phenomenon, and\nhas been remarked upon and studied empirically [Hayes and Hannigan 2006, Ahmad\net al. 2014, Delmarcelle 2019].\nWe provide the first theoretical analysis for such a scenario. We find that\n\"coupon collecting with friends\" can indeed significantly reduce the number of\ncoupons each collector must sample, and raises interesting connections to the\nmore traditional variants of the problem. While our analysis is in most cases\nasymptotically tight, there are several open questions raised, regarding\nfiner-grained analysis of both \"coupon collecting with friends\", and of a\nlong-studied variant of the original problem in which a collector requires\nmultiple full sets of coupons.",

    "abstract": "Real-world data often comes in compressed form. Analyzing compressed data\ndirectly (without decompressing it) can save space and time by orders of\nmagnitude. In this work, we focus on fundamental sequence comparison problems\nand try to quantify the gain in time complexity when the underlying data is\nhighly compressible. We consider grammar compression, which unifies many\npractically relevant compression schemes. For two strings of total length $N$\nand total compressed size $n$, it is known that the edit distance and a longest\ncommon subsequence (LCS) can be computed exactly in time $\\tilde{O}(nN)$, as\nopposed to $O(N^2)$ for the uncompressed setting. Many applications need to\nalign multiple sequences simultaneously, and the fastest known exact algorithms\nfor median edit distance and LCS of $k$ strings run in $O(N^k)$ time. This\nnaturally raises the question of whether compression can help to reduce the\nrunning time significantly for $k \\geq 3$, perhaps to $O(N^{k/2}n^{k/2})$ or\n$O(Nn^{k-1})$. Unfortunately, we show lower bounds that rule out any\nimprovement beyond $\\Omega(N^{k-1}n)$ time for any of these problems assuming\nthe Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis.\nAt the same time, we show that approximation and compression together can be\nsurprisingly effective. We develop an $\\tilde{O}(N^{k/2}n^{k/2})$-time FPTAS\nfor the median edit distance of $k$ sequences. In comparison, no\n$O(N^{k-\\Omega(1)})$-time PTAS is known for the median edit distance problem in\nthe uncompressed setting. For two strings, we get an\n$\\tilde{O}(N^{2/3}n^{4/3})$-time FPTAS for both edit distance and LCS. In\ncontrast, for uncompressed strings, there is not even a subquadratic algorithm\nfor LCS that has less than a polynomial gap in the approximation factor.\nBuilding on the insight from our approximation algorithms, we also obtain\nresults for many distance measures including the edit, Hamming, and shift\ndistances.",

Although the algorithm is inspired by the swarming\nbehavior of ants, it does not have any algorithmic similarity with the ant\ncolony optimization (ACO) algorithm. It is worth mentioning that ANA is\nconsidered a continuous algorithm that updates the search agent position by\nadding the rate of change (e.g., step or velocity). ANA computes the rate of\nchange differently as it uses previous, current solutions, fitness values\nduring the optimization process to generate weights by utilizing the\nPythagorean theorem. These weights drive the search agents during the\nexploration and exploitation phases. The ANA algorithm is benchmarked on 26\nwell-known test functions, and the results are verified by a comparative study\nwith genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), dragonfly\nalgorithm (DA), five modified versions of PSO, whale optimization algorithm\n(WOA), salp swarm algorithm (SSA), and fitness dependent optimizer (FDO).

Thus, two Gaussian\nprocesses are introduced to separately model the observation and local\ncharacteristics of the data. While, the \\textit{observation process} is used to\nmodel the ground, the \\textit{latent process} is put on length-scale values to\nestimate point values of length-scales at each input location. Input locations\nfor this latent process are chosen in a physically-motivated procedure to\nrepresent an intuition about ground condition. Furthermore, an intuitive guess\nof length-scale value is represented by assuming the existence of hypothetical\nsurfaces in the environment that every bunch of data points may be assumed to\nbe resulted from measurements from this surfaces.

Due to their short duration and low intensity, the recognition of\nmicro-expressions is a difficult task in affective computing. The early work\nbased on handcrafted spatio-temporal features which showed some promise, has\nrecently been superseded by different deep learning approaches which now\ncompete for the state of the art performance. Nevertheless, the problem of\ncapturing both local and global spatio-temporal patterns remains challenging.\nTo this end, herein we propose a novel spatio-temporal transformer architecture\n-- to the best of our knowledge, the first purely transformer based approach\n(i.e. void of any convolutional network use) for micro-expression recognition.\nThe architecture comprises a spatial encoder which learns spatial patterns, a\ntemporal aggregator for temporal dimension analysis, and a classification head.\nA comprehensive evaluation on three widely used spontaneous micro-expression\ndata sets, namely SMIC-HS, CASME II and SAMM, shows that the proposed approach\nconsistently outperforms the state of the art, and is the first framework in\nthe published literature on micro-expression recognition to achieve the\nunweighted F1-score greater than 0.9 on any of the aforementioned data sets.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers a transmitter, which uses random linear coding (RLC) to\nencode data packets. The generated coded packets are broadcast to one or more\nreceivers. A receiver can recover the data packets if it gathers a sufficient\nnumber of coded packets. We assume that the receiver does not abandon its\nefforts to obtain the data packets if RLC decoding has been unsuccessful;\ninstead, it employs syndrome decoding in an effort to repair erroneously\nreceived coded packets before it attempts RLC decoding again. A key assumption\nof most decoding techniques, including syndrome decoding, is that errors are\nindependently and identically distributed within the received coded packets.\nMotivated by the recently proposed `guessing random additive noise decoding'\n(GRAND) framework, we develop transversal GRAND: an algorithm that exploits\nstatistical dependence in the occurrence of errors, complements RLC decoding\nand achieves a gain over syndrome decoding, in terms of the probability that\nthe receiver will recover the original data packets.",

The Dyck edit distance\nquantifies the number of edits (character insertions, deletions, and\nsubstitutions) required to make a given parenthesis sequence well-balanced.

Given that semantic\nsegmentation has been applied in many safety-critical applications (e.g.,\nautonomous driving, geological sensing), it is important to fill this knowledge\ngap, in particular, how these models are affected under adversarial samples.\nWhile adversarial attacks against point cloud have been studied, we found all\nof them were targeting single-object recognition, and the perturbation is done\non the point coordinates.

By evaluating COLPER on an indoor dataset (S3DIS) and an outdoor\ndataset (Semantic3D) against three point cloud segmentation models (PointNet++,\nDeepGCNs, and RandLA-Net), we found color-only perturbation is sufficient to\nsignificantly drop the segmentation accuracy and aIoU, under both targeted and\nnon-targeted attack settings.",

We postulate that the gist of the difficulty in face-swapping is\nunstable gradients and it can be resolved by a smooth identity embedder.\nSmooth-swap adopts an embedder trained using supervised contrastive learning,\nwhere we find its improved smoothness allows faster and stable training even\nwith a simple U-Net-based generator and three basic loss functions. Extensive\nexperiments on face-swapping benchmarks (FFHQ, FaceForensics++) and face images\nin the wild show that our model is also quantitatively and qualitatively\ncomparable or even superior to existing methods in terms of identity change.",

At the technical level, identifying the\ncontraction metric, which is the distance metric with respect to which a\nrobot's trajectories exhibit contraction is often non-trivial. We propose to\njointly learn the control policy and its corresponding contraction metric while\nenforcing contraction. To achieve this, we learn an implicit dynamics model of\nthe robotic system from an offline data set consisting of the robot's state and\ninput trajectories. Using this learned dynamics model, we propose a data\naugmentation algorithm for learning contraction policies. We randomly generate\nsamples in the state-space and propagate them forward in time through the\nlearned dynamics model to generate auxiliary sample trajectories. We then learn\nboth the control policy and the contraction metric such that the distance\nbetween the trajectories from the offline data set and our generated auxiliary\nsample trajectories decreases over time. We evaluate the performance of our\nproposed framework on simulated robotic goal-reaching tasks and demonstrate\nthat enforcing contraction results in faster convergence and greater robustness\nof the learned policy.",

    "abstract": "Automatically writing long articles is a complex and challenging language\ngeneration task. Prior work has primarily focused on generating these articles\nusing human-written prompt to provide some topical context and some metadata\nabout the article. That said, for many applications, such as generating news\nstories, these articles are often paired with images and their captions or\nalt-text, which in turn are based on real-world events and may reference many\ndifferent named entities that are difficult to be correctly recognized and\npredicted by language models. To address these two problems, this paper\nintroduces an Entity-aware News Generation method with Image iNformation,\nEngin, to incorporate news image information into language models. Engin\nproduces news articles conditioned on both metadata and information such as\ncaptions and named entities extracted from images.

We perform experiments on two public large-scale news\ndatasets, GoodNews and VisualNews. Quantitative results show that our approach\nimproves article perplexity by 4-5 points over the base models. Qualitative\nresults demonstrate the text generated by Engin is more consistent with news\nimages.

Following a cloud-native paradigm to train DRL agents on a GPU cloud\nplatform is a promising solution.

Our\nElegantRL-podracer library features high scalability, elasticity and\naccessibility by following the development principles of containerization,\nmicroservices and MLOps.

Systemic Thinking Philosophy\nand the System Dynamics methodology now seem to be more relevant than ever and\ntheir practical implementation in real-life industrial cases has started to\nbecome a trend. Companies that decide to implement such approaches can achieve\nsignificant improvements to the effectiveness of their operations and gain a\ncompetitive advantage. This research, influenced by the Systemic Thinking\nPhilosophy, applies a System Dynamics approach in practice by improving the\nquality control process of a pharmaceutical company. The process is modeled,\nsimulated, analyzed, and improvements are performed to achieve more effective\nand efficient operations. The results show that all these steps led to a\nsuccessful identification and optimization of the critical factors, and a\nsignificant process improvement was achieved.",

    "abstract": "Over the last years, many face analysis tasks have accomplished astounding\nperformance, with applications including face generation and 3D face\nreconstruction from a single \"in-the-wild\" image. Nevertheless, to the best of\nour knowledge, there is no method which can produce render-ready\nhigh-resolution 3D faces from \"in-the-wild\" images and this can be attributed\nto the: (a) scarcity of available data for training, and (b) lack of robust\nmethodologies that can successfully be applied on very high-resolution data. In\nthis work, we introduce the first method that is able to reconstruct\nphotorealistic render-ready 3D facial geometry and BRDF from a single\n\"in-the-wild\" image. We capture a large dataset of facial shape and\nreflectance, which we have made public. We define a fast facial photorealistic\ndifferentiable rendering methodology with accurate facial skin diffuse and\nspecular reflection, self-occlusion and subsurface scattering approximation.\nWith this, we train a network that disentangles the facial diffuse and specular\nBRDF components from a shape and texture with baked illumination, reconstructed\nwith a state-of-the-art 3DMM fitting method. Our method outperforms the\nexisting arts by a significant margin and reconstructs high-resolution 3D faces\nfrom a single low-resolution image, that can be rendered in various\napplications, and bridge the uncanny valley.",

    "abstract": "The generalization gap on the long-tailed data sets is largely owing to most\ncategories only occupying a few training samples. Decoupled training achieves\nbetter performance by training backbone and classifier separately. What causes\nthe poorer performance of end-to-end model training (e.g., logits margin-based\nmethods)? In this work, we identify a key factor that affects the learning of\nthe classifier: the channel-correlated features with low entropy before\ninputting into the classifier. From the perspective of information theory, we\nanalyze why cross-entropy loss tends to produce highly correlated features on\nthe imbalanced data. In addition, we theoretically analyze and prove its\nimpacts on the gradients of classifier weights, the condition number of\nHessian, and logits margin-based approach. Therefore, we firstly propose to use\nChannel Whitening to decorrelate (\"scatter\") the classifier's inputs for\ndecoupling the weight update and reshaping the skewed decision boundary, which\nachieves satisfactory results combined with logits margin-based method.\nHowever, when the number of minor classes are large, batch imbalance and more\nparticipation in training cause over-fitting of the major classes. We also\npropose two novel modules, Block-based Relatively Balanced Batch Sampler (B3RS)\nand Batch Embedded Training (BET) to solve the above problems, which makes the\nend-to-end training achieve even better performance than decoupled training.\nExperimental results on the long-tailed classification benchmarks, CIFAR-LT and\nImageNet-LT, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

    "abstract": "Cogent is a restricted functional language designed to reduce the cost of\ndeveloping verified systems code. Because of its sometimes-onerous\nrestrictions, such as the lack of support for recursion and its strict\nuniqueness type system, Cogent provides an escape hatch in the form of a\nforeign function interface (FFI) to C code. This poses a problem when verifying\nCogent programs, as imported C components do not enjoy the same level of static\nguarantees that Cogent does. Previous verification of file systems implemented\nin Cogent merely assumed that their C components were correct and that they\npreserved the invariants of Cogent's type system. In this paper, we instead\nprove such obligations. We demonstrate how they smoothly compose with existing\nCogent theorems, and result in a correctness theorem of the overall Cogent-C\nsystem. The Cogent FFI constraints ensure that key invariants of Cogent's type\nsystem are maintained even when calling C code. We verify reusable higher-order\nand polymorphic functions including a generic loop combinator and array\niterators and demonstrate their application to several examples including\nbinary search and the BilbyFs file system. We demonstrate the feasibility of\nverification of mixed Cogent-C systems, and provide some insight into\nverification of software comprised of code in multiple languages with differing\nlevels of static guarantees.",

We also propose a\nContextual Labels Extension (CLE) to boost regional annotations with contextual\nattention guidance. With the collaboration of semantics-agnostic panoptic\nmatching and regionbiased selection and extension, our CPRAL can strike a\nbalance between labeling efforts and performance and compromise the semantics\ndistribution.

Most\nrecent studies tried to improve the performance of matching cost volume in MVS\nby designing aggregated 3D cost volumes and their regularization. This paper\nfocuses on learning a robust feature extraction network to enhance the\nperformance of matching costs without heavy computation in the other steps. In\nparticular, we present a dynamic scale feature extraction network, namely,\nCDSFNet. It is composed of multiple novel convolution layers, each of which can\nselect a proper patch scale for each pixel guided by the normal curvature of\nthe image surface. As a result, CDFSNet can estimate the optimal patch scales\nto learn discriminative features for accurate matching computation between\nreference and source images.

    "abstract": "We introduce a three stage pipeline: resized-diverse-inputs (RDIM),\ndiversity-ensemble (DEM) and region fitting, that work together to generate\ntransferable adversarial examples. We first explore the internal relationship\nbetween existing attacks, and propose RDIM that is capable of exploiting this\nrelationship. Then we propose DEM, the multi-scale version of RDIM, to generate\nmulti-scale gradients. After the first two steps we transform value fitting\ninto region fitting across iterations. RDIM and region fitting do not require\nextra running time and these three steps can be well integrated into other\nattacks. Our best attack fools six black-box defenses with a 93% success rate\non average, which is higher than the state-of-the-art gradient-based attacks.\nBesides, we rethink existing attacks rather than simply stacking new methods on\nthe old ones to get better performance. It is expected that our findings will\nserve as the beginning of exploring the internal relationship between attack\nmethods. Codes are available at https://github.com/278287847/DEM.",

    "abstract": "There are two main challenges in document-level event extraction: 1) argument\nentities are scattered in different sentences, and 2) event triggers are often\nnot available. To address these challenges, most previous studies mainly focus\non building argument chains in an autoregressive way, which is inefficient in\nboth training and inference. In contrast to the previous studies, we propose a\nfast and lightweight model named as PTPCG. We design a non-autoregressive\ndecoding algorithm to perform event argument combination extraction on pruned\ncomplete graphs, which are constructed under the guidance of the automatically\nselected pseudo triggers. Compared to the previous systems, our system achieves\ncompetitive results with lower resource consumption, taking only 3.6% GPU time\n(pfs-days) for training and up to 8.5 times faster for inference. Besides, our\napproach shows superior compatibility for the datasets with (or without)\ntriggers and the pseudo triggers can be the supplements for annotated triggers\nto make further improvements.",

The majority of the existing decision\nprocedures and solvers for these theories are themselves intricate; they are\ncomplicated algorithmically, and also have to deal with a very rich vocabulary\nof operations. This has led to a plethora of bugs in implementation, which have\nfor instance been discovered through fuzzing. In this paper, we present\nCertiStr, a certified implementation of a string constraint solver for the\ntheory of strings with concatenation and regular constraints. CertiStr aims to\nsolve string constraints using a forward-propagation algorithm based on\nsymbolic representations of regular constraints as symbolic automata, which\nreturns three results: sat, unsat, and unknown, and is guaranteed to terminate\nfor the string constraints whose concatenation dependencies are acyclic. The\nimplementation has been developed and proven correct in Isabelle/HOL, through\nwhich an effective solver in OCaml was generated. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of CertiStr against the standard Kaluza benchmark,\nin which 80.4% tests are in the string constraint fragment of CertiStr.

Recently, in deep learning, the Transformer shows the\npotential to exploit the long-range dependency in speech by self-attention.\nTherefore, it is introduced in speech enhancement to improve the speech\nestimation accuracy from a noise mixture. However, to address the computational\ncost issue in Transformer with self-attention, the axial attention is the\noption i.e., to split a 2D attention into two 1D attentions. Inspired by the\naxial attention, in the proposed method we calculate the attention map along\nboth time- and frequency-axis to generate time and frequency sub-attention\nmaps. Moreover, different from the axial attention, the proposed method\nprovides two parallel multi-head attentions for time- and frequency-axis.\nFurthermore, it is proven in the literature that the lower frequency-band in\nspeech, generally, contains more desired information than the higher\nfrequency-band, in a noise mixture. Therefore, the frequency-band aware\nattention is proposed i.e., high frequency-band attention (HFA), and low\nfrequency-band attention (LFA).

We revisit the foundation of adversarial imitation\nand propose an off-policy sample efficient approach that requires no\nadversarial training or min-max optimization. Our formulation capitalizes on\ntwo key insights: (1) the similarity between the Bellman equation and the\nstationary state-action distribution equation allows us to derive a novel\ntemporal difference (TD) learning approach; and (2) the use of a deterministic\npolicy simplifies the TD learning. Combined, these insights yield a practical\nalgorithm, Deterministic and Discriminative Imitation (D2-Imitation), which\noperates by first partitioning samples into two replay buffers and then\nlearning a deterministic policy via off-policy reinforcement learning.

    "abstract": "Muscle-actuated control is a research topic of interest spanning different\nfields, in particular biomechanics, robotics and graphics. This type of control\nis particularly challenging because models are often overactuated, and dynamics\nare delayed and non-linear. It is however a very well tested and tuned\nactuation model that has undergone millions of years of evolution and that\ninvolves interesting properties exploiting passive forces of muscle-tendon\nunits and efficient energy storage and release. To facilitate research on\nmuscle-actuated simulation, we release a 3D musculoskeletal simulation of an\nostrich based on the MuJoCo simulator. Ostriches are one of the fastest bipeds\non earth and are therefore an excellent model for studying muscle-actuated\nbipedal locomotion. The model is based on CT scans and dissections used to\ngather actual muscle data such as insertion sites, lengths and pennation\nangles. Along with this model, we also provide a set of reinforcement learning\ntasks, including reference motion tracking and a reaching task with the neck.\nThe reference motion data are based on motion capture clips of various\nbehaviors which we pre-processed and adapted to our model. This paper describes\nhow the model was built and iteratively improved using the tasks. We evaluate\nthe accuracy of the muscle actuation patterns by comparing them to\nexperimentally collected electromyographic data from locomoting birds. We\nbelieve that this work can be a useful bridge between the biomechanics,\nreinforcement learning, graphics and robotics communities, by providing a fast\nand easy to use simulation.",

To evaluate their\nrobustness, existing research conducts adversarial attacks in the\nwhite/gray-box setting where model parameters are accessible. However, a more\nrealistic black-box adversarial attack is ignored even though most real-world\nmodels are trained with private data and released as black-box services on the\ncloud. To fill this gap, we propose the first black-box adversarial attack\nmethod against health risk prediction models named MedAttacker to investigate\ntheir vulnerability. MedAttacker addresses the challenges brought by EHR data\nvia two steps: hierarchical position selection which selects the attacked\npositions in a reinforcement learning (RL) framework and substitute selection\nwhich identifies substitute with a score-based principle. Particularly, by\nconsidering the temporal context inside EHRs, it initializes its RL position\nselection policy by using the contribution score of each visit and the saliency\nscore of each code, which can be well integrated with the deterministic\nsubstitute selection process decided by the score changes. In experiments,\nMedAttacker consistently achieves the highest average success rate and even\noutperforms a recent white-box EHR adversarial attack technique in certain\ncases when attacking three advanced health risk prediction models in the\nblack-box setting across multiple real-world datasets. In addition, based on\nthe experiment results we include a discussion on defending EHR adversarial\nattacks.",

Following a trend towards end-to-end\ntraining of sequential neural network models, several research groups have\naddressed this problem with joint training of front-end enhancement module with\nback-end recognition module. While this approach ensures enhancement outputs\nare helpful for recognition, the enhancement model can overfit to the training\ndata, weakening the recognition model in the presence of unseen noise. To\naddress this, we used a pre-trained acoustic model to generate a perceptual\nloss that makes speech enhancement more aware of the phonetic properties of the\nsignal. This approach keeps some benefits of joint training, while alleviating\nthe overfitting problem. Experiments on Voicebank + DEMAND dataset for\nenhancement show that this approach achieves a new state of the art for some\nobjective enhancement scores.

    "abstract": "Deep image prior (DIP) and its variants have showed remarkable potential for\nsolving inverse problems in computer vision, without any extra training data.\nPractical DIP models are often substantially overparameterized. During the\nfitting process, these models learn mostly the desired visual content first,\nand then pick up the potential modeling and observational noise, i.e.,\noverfitting. Thus, the practicality of DIP often depends critically on good\nearly stopping (ES) that captures the transition period. In this regard, the\nmajority of DIP works for vision tasks only demonstrates the potential of the\nmodels -- reporting the peak performance against the ground truth, but provides\nno clue about how to operationally obtain near-peak performance without access\nto the groundtruth. In this paper, we set to break this practicality barrier of\nDIP, and propose an efficient ES strategy, which consistently detects near-peak\nperformance across several vision tasks and DIP variants. Based on a simple\nmeasure of dispersion of consecutive DIP reconstructions, our ES method not\nonly outpaces the existing ones -- which only work in very narrow domains, but\nalso remains effective when combined with a number of methods that try to\nmitigate the overfitting.

VR systems can greatly help\nthis task by providing an immersive experience; however, a common issue with\nviewing and navigating a city in the traditional sense is that users can either\nobtain a local or a global view, but not both at the same time, requiring them\nto continuously switch between perspectives, losing context and distracting\nthem from their analysis. In this paper, our goal is to allow users to navigate\nto points of interest without changing perspectives. To accomplish this, we\ndesign an intuitive navigation interface that takes advantage of the strong\nsense of spatial presence provided by VR. We supplement this interface with a\nperspective that warps the environment, called UrbanRama, based on a\ncylindrical projection, providing a mix of local and global views. The design\nof this interface was performed as an iterative process in collaboration with\narchitects and urban planners. We conducted a qualitative and a quantitative\npilot user study to evaluate UrbanRama and the results indicate the\neffectiveness of our system in reducing perspective changes, while ensuring\nthat the warping doesn't affect distance and orientation perception.",

Despite\nof these incredible features that blockchain technology brings to these ICT\napplications, modern research have indicated that these strong guarantees are\nnot sufficient enough and blockchain networks may still prone to various\nsecurity, privacy, and reliability related issues. In order to overcome these\nissues, it is important to identify the anomalous behaviour within time.\nTherefore, nowadays anomaly detection models are playing an important role in\nprotection of modern blockchain networks. These anomaly detection models\nautonomously detect and predict anomaly in the network in order to protect\nnetwork from unexpected attacks.

The coupling\ntakes the form of boundary conditions imposed on the interface, relating the\nsolution variables for both models to each other. The multirate aspect arises\nwhen numerical time integration is performed with different time step sizes for\nthe component models. In this paper, we seek to identify a unified approach to\ndevelop multirate algorithms for these coupled problems. This effort is pursued\nthough the use of discontinuous-Galerkin time stepping methods, acting as a\ngeneral unified framework, with different time step sizes. The subproblems are\ncoupled across user-defined intervals of time, called {\\it coupling windows},\nusing polynomials that are continuous on the window. The coupling method is\nshown to reproduce the correct interfacial energy dissipation, discrete\nconservation of fluxes, and asymptotic accuracy.

    "abstract": "Vertebrate retinas are highly-efficient in processing trivial visual tasks\nsuch as detecting moving objects, yet a complex task for modern computers. The\ndetection of object motion is done by specialised retinal ganglion cells named\nObject-motion-sensitive ganglion cells (OMS-GC). OMS-GC process continuous\nsignals and generate spike patterns that are post-processed by the Visual\nCortex. The Neuromorphic Hybrid Spiking Motion Detector (NeuroHSMD) proposed in\nthis work accelerates the HSMD algorithm using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays\n(FPGAs). The Hybrid Spiking Motion Detector (HSMD) algorithm was the first\nhybrid algorithm to enhance dynamic background subtraction (DBS) algorithms\nwith a customised 3-layer spiking neural network (SNN) that generates OMS-GC\nspiking-like responses. The NeuroHSMD algorithm was compared against the HSMD\nalgorithm, using the same 2012 change detection (CDnet2012) and 2014 change\ndetection (CDnet2014) benchmark datasets. The results show that the NeuroHSMD\nhas produced the same results as the HSMD algorithm in real-time without\ndegradation of quality. Moreover, the NeuroHSMD proposed in this paper was\ncompletely implemented in Open Computer Language (OpenCL) and therefore is\neasily replicated in other devices such as Graphical Processor Units (GPUs) and\nclusters of Central Processor Units (CPUs).",

    "title": "Improving Vision Transformers for Incremental Learning",
    "abstract": "This paper studies using Vision Transformers (ViT) in class incremental\nlearning. Surprisingly, naive application of ViT to replace convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) results in performance degradation. Our analysis reveals\nthree issues of naively using ViT: (a) ViT has very slow convergence when class\nnumber is small, (b) more bias towards new classes is observed in ViT than\nCNN-based models, and (c) the proper learning rate of ViT is too low to learn a\ngood classifier. Base on this analysis, we show these issues can be simply\naddressed by using existing techniques: using convolutional stem, balanced\nfinetuning to correct bias, and higher learning rate for the classifier. Our\nsimple solution, named ViTIL (ViT for Incremental Learning), achieves the new\nstate-of-the-art for all three class incremental learning setups by a clear\nmargin, providing a strong baseline for the research community. For instance,\non ImageNet-1000, our ViTIL achieves 69.20% top-1 accuracy for the protocol of\n500 initial classes with 5 incremental steps (100 new classes for each),\noutperforming LUCIR+DDE by 1.69%. For more challenging protocol of 10\nincremental steps (100 new classes), our method outperforms PODNet by 7.27%\n(65.13% vs. 57.86%).",

    "abstract": "Many historical map sheets are publicly available for studies that require\nlong-term historical geographic data. The cartographic design of these maps\nincludes a combination of map symbols and text labels. Automatically reading\ntext labels from map images could greatly speed up the map interpretation and\nhelps generate rich metadata describing the map content. Many text detection\nalgorithms have been proposed to locate text regions in map images\nautomatically, but most of the algorithms are trained on out-ofdomain datasets\n(e.g., scenic images). Training data determines the quality of machine learning\nmodels, and manually annotating text regions in map images is labor-extensive\nand time-consuming. On the other hand, existing geographic data sources, such\nas Open- StreetMap (OSM), contain machine-readable map layers, which allow us\nto separate out the text layer and obtain text label annotations easily.\nHowever, the cartographic styles between OSM map tiles and historical maps are\nsignificantly different. This paper proposes a method to automatically generate\nan unlimited amount of annotated historical map images for training text\ndetection models. We use a style transfer model to convert contemporary map\nimages into historical style and place text labels upon them. We show that the\nstate-of-the-art text detection models (e.g., PSENet) can benefit from the\nsynthetic historical maps and achieve significant improvement for historical\nmap text detection.",

We present a method to\ncraft a single set of perturbations that, when added to any stereo image pair\nin a dataset, can fool a stereo network to significantly alter the perceived\nscene geometry. Our perturbation images are \"universal\" in that they not only\ncorrupt estimates of the network on the dataset they are optimized for, but\nalso generalize to stereo networks with different architectures across\ndifferent datasets. We evaluate our approach on multiple public benchmark\ndatasets and show that our perturbations can increase D1-error (akin to fooling\nrate) of state-of-the-art stereo networks from 1% to as much as 87%. We\ninvestigate the effect of perturbations on the estimated scene geometry and\nidentify object classes that are most vulnerable. Our analysis on the\nactivations of registered points between left and right images led us to find\nthat certain architectural components, i.e. deformable convolution and explicit\nmatching, can increase robustness against adversaries. We demonstrate that by\nsimply designing networks with such components, one can reduce the effect of\nadversaries by up to 60.5%, which rivals the robustness of networks fine-tuned\nwith costly adversarial data augmentation.",

    "abstract": "Recent work [4] analyses the local convergence of Adam in a neighbourhood of\nan optimal solution for a twice-differentiable function. It is found that the\nlearning rate has to be sufficiently small to ensure local stability of the\noptimal solution. The above convergence results also hold for AdamW. In this\nwork, we propose a new adaptive optimisation method by extending AdamW in two\naspects with the purpose to relax the requirement on small learning rate for\nlocal stability, which we refer to as Aida. Firstly, we consider tracking the\n2nd moment r_t of the pth power of the gradient-magnitudes. r_t reduces to v_t\nof AdamW when p=2. Suppose {m_t} is the first moment of AdamW. It is known that\nthe update direction m_{t+1}/(v_{t+1}+epsilon)^0.5 (or\nm_{t+1}/(v_{t+1}^0.5+epsilon) of AdamW (or Adam) can be decomposed as the sign\nvector sign(m_{t+1}) multiplied elementwise by a vector of magnitudes\n|m_{t+1}|/(v_{t+1}+epsilon)^0.5 (or |m_{t+1}|/(v_{t+1}^0.5+epsilon)). Aida is\ndesigned to compute the qth power of the magnitude in the form of\n|m_{t+1}|^q/(r_{t+1}+epsilon)^(q/p) (or |m_{t+1}|^q/((r_{t+1})^(q/p)+epsilon)),\nwhich reduces to that of AdamW when (p,q)=(2,1).\nSuppose the origin 0 is a local optimal solution of a twice-differentiable\nfunction. It is found theoretically that when q>1 and p>1 in Aida, the origin 0\nis locally stable only when the weight-decay is non-zero. Experiments are\nconducted for solving ten toy optimisation problems and training Transformer\nand Swin-Transformer for two deep learning (DL) tasks. The empirical study\ndemonstrates that in a number of scenarios (including the two DL tasks), Aida\nwith particular setups of (p,q) not equal to (2,1) outperforms the setup\n(p,q)=(2,1) of AdamW.",

This paper aims to solve the question, \"Given a function with its\nparameters and metadata, how to select the executor in a distributed manner and\nobtain the result in NDN?\" To answer it, we design R2 that involves the\nfollowing stages. First, we design a name structure including data, function\nnames, and other function parameters. Second, we develop a 2-phase mechanism,\nwhere in the first phase, the function request from a client-first reaches the\ndata source and retrieves the metadata, then the best node is selected while\nthe metadata is responding to the client. In the second phase, the chosen node\ndirectly retrieves the data, executes the function, and provides the result to\nthe client. Furthermore, we propose a stop condition to intelligently reduce\nthe processing time of the first phase and provide a simple proof and range\nanalysis. Simulations confirm that R2 outperforms the current solutions in\nterms of resource allocation, especially when the data volume and the function\ncomplexity are high. In the experiments, when the data size is 100 KiB and the\nfunction complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, the speedup ratio is 4.61.

    "abstract": "High fidelity behavior prediction of human drivers is crucial for efficient\nand safe deployment of autonomous vehicles, which is challenging due to the\nstochasticity, heterogeneity, and time-varying nature of human behaviors. On\none hand, the trained prediction model can only capture the motion pattern in\nan average sense, while the nuances among individuals can hardly be reflected.\nOn the other hand, the prediction model trained on the training set may not\ngeneralize to the testing set which may be in a different scenario or data\ndistribution, resulting in low transferability and generalizability. In this\npaper, we applied a $\\tau$-step modified Extended Kalman Filter parameter\nadaptation algorithm (MEKF$_\\lambda$) to the driving behavior prediction task,\nwhich has not been studied before in literature. With the feedback of the\nobserved trajectory, the algorithm is applied to neural-network-based models to\nimprove the performance of driving behavior predictions across different human\nsubjects and scenarios. A new set of metrics is proposed for systematic\nevaluation of online adaptation performance in reducing the prediction error\nfor different individuals and scenarios. Empirical studies on the best layer in\nthe model and steps of observation to adapt are also provided.",

    "abstract": "Crowd flow forecasting, e.g., predicting the crowds entering or leaving\ncertain regions, is of great importance to real-world urban applications. One\nof the key properties of crowd flow data is periodicity: a pattern that occurs\nat regular time intervals, such as a weekly pattern. To capture such\nperiodicity, existing studies either explicitly model it based on the periodic\nhidden states or implicitly learn it by feeding all periodic segments into\nneural networks. In this paper, we devise a novel periodic residual learning\nnetwork (PRNet) for better modeling the periodicity in crowd flow data.\nDiffering from existing methods, PRNet frames the crowd flow forecasting as a\nperiodic residual learning problem by modeling the deviation between the input\n(the previous time period) and the output (the future time period). As compared\nto predicting highly dynamic crowd flows directly, learning such stationary\ndeviation is much easier, which thus facilitates the model training. Besides,\nthe learned deviation enables the network to produce the residual between\nfuture conditions and its corresponding weekly observations at each time\ninterval, and therefore contributes to substantially better predictions. We\nfurther propose a lightweight Spatial-Channel Enhanced Encoder to build more\npowerful region representations, by jointly capturing global spatial\ncorrelations and temporal dependencies. Experimental results on two real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in\nterms of both accuracy and robustness.",

Due to the\npervasiveness and diversity of cryptographic misuses, a comprehensive and\naccurate understanding of how cryptographic misuses can undermine the security\nof an Android app is critical to the subsequent mitigation strategies but also\nchallenging. Although various approaches have been proposed to detect\ncryptographic misuses in Android apps, seldom studies have focused on\nestimating the security risks introduced by cryptographic misuses. To address\nthis problem, we present an extensible framework for deciding the threat level\nof cryptographic misuses in Android apps. Firstly, we propose a unified\nspecification for representing cryptographic misuses to make our framework\nextensible and develop adapters to unify the detection results of the\nstate-of-the-art cryptographic misuse detectors, resulting in an adapter-based\ndetection toolchain for a more comprehensive list of cryptographic misuses.\nSecondly, we employ a misuse-originating data-flow analysis to connect each\ncryptographic misuse to a set of data-flow sinks in an app, based on which we\npropose a quantitative data-flow-driven metric for assessing the overall risk\nof the app introduced by cryptographic misuses. To make the per-app assessment\nmore useful in the app vetting at the app-store level, we apply unsupervised\nlearning to predict and classify the top risky threats, to guide more efficient\nsubsequent mitigations. In the experiments on an instantiated implementation of\nthe framework, we evaluate the accuracy of our detection and the effect of\ndata-flow-driven risk assessment of our framework.

The running time of an algorithm that computes the measure plays a\nvery small role in an offline setting, for example, when the classifier is\nbeing developed by a researcher. However, the running time becomes more crucial\nif our goal is to monitor the performance of a classifier over time.\nIn this paper we study three algorithms for maintaining two measures. The\nfirst algorithm maintains area under the ROC curve (AUC) under addition and\ndeletion of data points in $O(\\log n)$ time. This is done by maintaining the\ndata points sorted in a self-balanced search tree. In addition, we augment the\nsearch tree that allows us to query the ROC coordinates of a data point in\n$O(\\log n)$ time. In doing so we are able to maintain AUC in $O(\\log n)$ time.\nOur next two algorithms involve in maintaining $H$-measure, an alternative\nmeasure based on the ROC curve. Computing the measure is a two-step process:\nfirst we need to compute a convex hull of the ROC curve, followed by a sum over\nthe convex hull. We demonstrate that we can maintain the convex hull using a\nminor modification of the classic convex hull maintenance algorithm. We then\nshow that under certain conditions, we can compute the $H$-measure exactly in\n$O(\\log^2 n)$ time, and if the conditions are not met, then we can estimate the\n$H$-measure in $O((\\log n + \\epsilon^{-1})\\log n)$ time.

The row block predicts the camera motion that must be associated\nwith every pixel in the target i.e, RS rectified image. Finally, the RS\nrectification module uses motion trajectory and the output of row block to warp\nthe input RS image to arrive at a distortionfree image. For faster convergence\nduring training, we additionally use an RS regeneration module which compares\nthe input RS image with the ground truth image distorted by estimated motion\nparameters.

Existing methods warp the target\nimage to the reference image using the estimated warp function, and a\nhomography is one of the most commonly used warping functions. However, when\nimages have large parallax due to non-planar scenes and translational motion of\na camera, the homography cannot fully describe the mapping between two images.\nExisting approaches based on global or local homography estimation are not free\nfrom this problem and suffer from undesired artifacts due to parallax. In this\npaper, instead of relying on the homography-based warp, we propose a novel deep\nimage stitching framework exploiting the pixel-wise warp field to handle the\nlarge-parallax problem. The proposed deep image stitching framework consists of\ntwo modules: Pixel-wise Warping Module (PWM) and Stitched Image Generating\nModule (SIGMo). PWM employs an optical flow estimation model to obtain\npixel-wise warp of the whole image, and relocates the pixels of the target\nimage with the obtained warp field. SIGMo blends the warped target image and\nthe reference image while eliminating unwanted artifacts such as misalignments,\nseams, and holes that harm the plausibility of the stitched result. For\ntraining and evaluating the proposed framework, we build a large-scale dataset\nthat includes image pairs with corresponding pixel-wise ground truth warp and\nsample stitched result images.

This problem is e.g. motivated in\nthe context of finding conflict-free schedules for maximum subsets of tasks,\nthat have certain (changing) constraints on each day they need to be performed.\nWe are specifically interested in the case where each task needs to be\nperformed in a certain time-interval on each day and two tasks are in conflict\non a day if their time-intervals overlap on that day. This leads us to\nconsidering Temporal $\\Delta$ Independent Set on the restricted class of\ntemporal unit interval graphs, i.e. temporal graphs where each layer is unit\ninterval.\nWe present several hardness results for this problem, as well as two\nalgorithms: The first is an constant-factor approximation algorithm for\ninstances where $\\tau$, the total number of time steps (layers) of the temporal\ngraph, and $\\Delta$, a parameter that allows us to model some tolerance in the\nconflicts, are constants. For the second result we use the notion of order\npreservation for temporal unit interval graphs that, informally, requires the\nintervals of every layer to obey a common ordering. We provide an FPT algorithm\nparameterized by the size of minimum vertex deletion set to order preservation.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, there is an explosive growth of screen contents due to the wide\napplication of screen sharing, remote cooperation, and online education. To\nmatch the limited terminal bandwidth, high-resolution (HR) screen contents may\nbe downsampled and compressed. At the receiver side, the super-resolution (SR)\nof low-resolution (LR) screen content images (SCIs) is highly demanded by the\nHR display or by the users to zoom in for detail observation. However, image SR\nmethods mostly designed for natural images do not generalize well for SCIs due\nto the very different image characteristics as well as the requirement of SCI\nbrowsing at arbitrary scales. To this end, we propose a novel Implicit\nTransformer Super-Resolution Network (ITSRN) for SCISR. For high-quality\ncontinuous SR at arbitrary ratios, pixel values at query coordinates are\ninferred from image features at key coordinates by the proposed implicit\ntransformer and an implicit position encoding scheme is proposed to aggregate\nsimilar neighboring pixel values to the query one. We construct benchmark SCI1K\nand SCI1K-compression datasets with LR and HR SCI pairs. Extensive experiments\nshow that the proposed ITSRN significantly outperforms several competitive\ncontinuous and discrete SR methods for both compressed and uncompressed SCIs.",

    "abstract": "In the literature, coarse-to-fine or scale-recurrent approach i.e.\nprogressively restoring a clean image from its low-resolution versions has been\nsuccessfully employed for single image deblurring. However, a major\ndisadvantage of existing methods is the need for paired data; i.e. sharpblur\nimage pairs of the same scene, which is a complicated and cumbersome\nacquisition procedure. Additionally, due to strong supervision on loss\nfunctions, pre-trained models of such networks are strongly biased towards the\nblur experienced during training and tend to give sub-optimal performance when\nconfronted by new blur kernels during inference time. To address the above\nissues, we propose unsupervised domain-specific deblurring using a\nscale-adaptive attention module (SAAM). Our network does not require supervised\npairs for training, and the deblurring mechanism is primarily guided by\nadversarial loss, thus making our network suitable for a distribution of blur\nfunctions. Given a blurred input image, different resolutions of the same image\nare used in our model during training and SAAM allows for effective flow of\ninformation across the resolutions. For network training at a specific scale,\nSAAM attends to lower scale features as a function of the current scale.\nDifferent ablation studies show that our coarse-to-fine mechanism outperforms\nend-to-end unsupervised models and SAAM is able to attend better compared to\nattention models used in literature. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons\n(on no-reference metrics) show that our method outperforms prior unsupervised\nmethods.",

However, as omnidirectional RGB-D data is not\nalways available, synthesizing RGB-D panorama data from limited information of\na scene can be useful. Therefore, some prior works tried to synthesize RGB\npanorama images from perspective RGB images; however, they suffer from limited\nimage quality and can not be directly extended for RGB-D panorama synthesis. In\nthis paper, we study a new problem: RGB-D panorama synthesis under the\narbitrary configurations of cameras and depth sensors. Accordingly, we propose\na novel bi-modal (RGB-D) panorama synthesis (BIPS) framework. Especially, we\nfocus on indoor environments where the RGB-D panorama can provide a complete 3D\nmodel for many applications. We design a generator that fuses the bi-modal\ninformation and train it with residual-aided adversarial learning (RDAL). RDAL\nallows to synthesize realistic indoor layout structures and interiors by\njointly inferring RGB panorama, layout depth, and residual depth. In addition,\nas there is no tailored evaluation metric for RGB-D panorama synthesis, we\npropose a novel metric to effectively evaluate its perceptual quality.\nExtensive experiments show that our method synthesizes high-quality indoor\nRGB-D panoramas and provides realistic 3D indoor models than prior methods.\nCode will be released upon acceptance.",

Since our task is to sequentially\ncapture the floor plan using monocular images, the entire scene structure, room\ninstances, and room shapes are unknown. To tackle these challenges, we first\nhandle the scale difference between visual odometry and layout geometry via\nformulating an entropy minimization process, which enables us to directly align\n360-layouts without knowing the entire scene in advance. Second, to\nsequentially identify individual rooms, we propose a novel room identification\nalgorithm that tracks every room along the camera exploration using geometry\ninformation. Lastly, to estimate the final shape of the room, we propose a\nshortest path algorithm with an iterative coarse-to-fine strategy, which\nimproves prior formulations with higher accuracy and faster run-time.

We raise an interesting yet challenging question: how to detect both\nbase (annotated for training) and novel keypoints for unseen species given a\nfew annotated samples?

Moreover, we model the uncertainty\nacross groups of keypoints by multivariate Gaussian distribution to exploit\nimplicit correlations between neighboring keypoints. We show the effectiveness\nof our FSKD on (i) novel keypoint detection for unseen species, and (ii)\nfew-shot Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR) and (iii) Semantic Alignment\n(SA) downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "Discovering hazardous scenarios is crucial in testing and further improving\ndriving policies. However, conducting efficient driving policy testing faces\ntwo key challenges. On the one hand, the probability of naturally encountering\nhazardous scenarios is low when testing a well-trained autonomous driving\nstrategy. Thus, discovering these scenarios by purely real-world road testing\nis extremely costly. On the other hand, a proper determination of accident\nresponsibility is necessary for this task. Collecting scenarios with\nwrong-attributed responsibilities will lead to an overly conservative\nautonomous driving strategy. To be more specific, we aim to discover hazardous\nscenarios that are autonomous-vehicle responsible (AV-responsible), i.e., the\nvulnerabilities of the under-test driving policy.\nTo this end, this work proposes a Safety Test framework by finding\nAv-Responsible Scenarios (STARS) based on multi-agent reinforcement learning.\nSTARS guides other traffic participants to produce Av-Responsible Scenarios and\nmake the under-test driving policy misbehave via introducing Hazard Arbitration\nReward (HAR). HAR enables our framework to discover diverse, complex, and\nAV-responsible hazardous scenarios. Experimental results against four different\ndriving policies in three environments demonstrate that STARS can effectively\ndiscover AV-responsible hazardous scenarios.

If a variable\nname and the value stored in the variable do not match, then the program\nsuffers from a name-value inconsistency, which is due to one of two situations\nthat developers may want to fix: Either a correct value is referred to through\na misleading name, which negatively affects code understandability and\nmaintainability, or the correct name is bound to a wrong value, which may cause\nunexpected runtime behavior. Finding name-value inconsistencies is hard because\nit requires an understanding of the meaning of names and knowledge about the\nvalues assigned to a variable at runtime. This paper presents Nalin, a\ntechnique to automatically detect name-value inconsistencies. The approach\ncombines a dynamic analysis that tracks assignments of values to names with a\nneural machine learning model that predicts whether a name and a value fit\ntogether.

We apply Nalin to 106,652 real-world Python programs, where\nmeaningful names are particularly important due to the absence of statically\ndeclared types.

This paper presents Secure Routine, a paradigm that uses\ndriver's habits to driver identification and, in particular, to distinguish the\nvehicle's owner from other drivers.

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been an increasing interest in models that generate\nnatural language explanations (NLEs) for their decisions. However, training a\nmodel to provide NLEs requires the acquisition of task-specific NLEs, which is\ntime- and resource-consuming. A potential solution is the out-of-domain\ntransfer of NLEs from a domain with a large number of NLEs to a domain with\nscarce NLEs but potentially a large number of labels, via few-shot transfer\nlearning. In this work, we introduce three vanilla approaches for few-shot\ntransfer learning of NLEs for the case of few NLEs but abundant labels, along\nwith an adaptation of an existing vanilla fine-tuning approach. We transfer\nexplainability from the natural language inference domain, where a large\ndataset of human-written NLEs exists (e-SNLI), to the domains of (1) hard cases\nof pronoun resolution, where we introduce a small dataset of NLEs on top of the\nWinoGrande dataset (small-e-WinoGrande), and (2) commonsense validation\n(ComVE). Our results demonstrate that the transfer of NLEs outperforms the\nsingle-task methods, and establish the best strategies out of the four\nidentified training regimes. We also investigate the scalability of the best\nmethods, both in terms of training data and model size.",

We start by specifying the adequate matrix-valued Banach\nspaces that are equipped with suitable classes of mixed-norms. We then show\nthat HTV is invariant to rotations, scalings, and translations. Additionally,\nits minimum value is achieved for linear mappings, supporting the common\nintuition that linear regression is the least complex learning model. Next, we\npresent closed-form expressions for computing the HTV of two general classes of\nfunctions. The first one is the class of Sobolev functions with a certain\ndegree of regularity, for which we show that HTV coincides with the\nHessian-Schatten seminorm that is sometimes used as a regularizer for image\nreconstruction. The second one is the class of continuous and piecewise linear\n(CPWL) functions. In this case, we show that the HTV reflects the total change\nin slopes between linear regions that have a common facet. Hence, it can be\nviewed as a convex relaxation (l1-type) of the number of linear regions\n(l0-type) of CPWL mappings.

These methods can be\ndivided into: 1) intrusive models, which use both, the original and the\ndegraded signals, and 2) non-intrusive models, which only require the degraded\nsignal. Recently, non-intrusive models based on neural networks showed to\noutperform signal processing based models. However, the advantages of deep\nlearning based models come with the cost of being more challenging to\ninterpret. To get more insight into the prediction models the non-intrusive\nspeech quality prediction model NISQA is analyzed in this paper. NISQA is\ncomposed of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network\n(RNN). The task of the CNN is to compute relevant features for the speech\nquality prediction on a frame level, while the RNN models time-dependencies\nbetween the individual speech frames. Different explanation algorithms are used\nto understand the automatically learned features of the CNN. In this way,\nseveral interpretable features could be identified, such as the sensitivity to\nnoise or strong interruptions. On the other hand, it was found that multiple\nfeatures carry redundant information.",

To train\npowerful DL models with large datasets efficiently, it has been a common\npractice for developers to parallelize and distribute the computation and\nmemory over multiple devices in the training process, which is known as\ndistributed training. However, existing efforts in the software engineering\n(SE) research community mainly focus on issues in the general process of\ntraining DL models. In contrast, to the best of our knowledge, issues that\ndevelopers encounter in distributed training have never been well studied.\nGiven the surging importance of distributed training in the current practice of\ndeveloping DL software, this paper fills in the knowledge gap and presents the\nfirst comprehensive study on developers' issues in distributed training. To\nthis end, we extract and analyze 1,054 real-world developers' issues in\ndistributed training from Stack Overflow and GitHub, two commonly used data\nsources for studying software issues. We construct a fine-grained taxonomy\nconsisting of 30 categories regarding the fault symptoms and summarize common\nfix patterns for different symptoms.

Alternatively, we can compute confidence bands, where we are\nrequired to find the smallest area enveloping $k$ time series, where $k$ is a\nuser parameter. Confidence bands can be then used to detect abnormal time\nseries, not just individual observations within the time series. We will show\nthat despite being an NP-hard problem it is possible to find optimal confidence\nband for some $k$. We do this by considering a different problem: discovering\nregularized bands, where we minimize the envelope area minus the number of\nincluded time series weighted by a parameter $\\alpha$. Unlike normal confidence\nbands we can solve the problem exactly by using a minimum cut. By varying\n$\\alpha$ we can obtain solutions for various $k$. If we have a constraint $k$\nfor which we cannot find appropriate $\\alpha$, we demonstrate a simple\nalgorithm that yields $O(\\sqrt{n})$ approximation guarantee by connecting the\nproblem to a minimum $k$-union problem. This connection also implies that we\ncannot approximate the problem better than $O(n^{1/4})$ under some (mild)\nassumptions.

We model the problem as a \\emph{Fill\nIn the Blank} game by masking some elements in the TS and imputing them with\nthe rest. Considering the two common anomaly shapes (point- or\nsequence-outliers) in TS data, we implement two masking strategies with many\nself-generated training samples. The corresponding self-imputation networks can\nextract more robust temporal relations than existing AD solutions and\neffectively facilitate identifying the two types of anomalies. For continuous\noutliers, we also propose an anomaly localization algorithm that dramatically\nreduces AD errors. Experiments on various real-world TS datasets demonstrate\nthat DeepFIB outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, achieving\nup to $65.2\\%$ relative improvement in F1-score.",

    "title": "Boosting the Capability of Intelligent Vulnerability Detection by  Training in a Human-Learning Manner",
    "abstract": "Due to its powerful automatic feature extraction, deep learning (DL) has been\nwidely used in source code vulnerability detection. However, although it\nperforms well on artificial datasets, its performance is not satisfactory when\ndetecting real-world vulnerabilities due to the high complexity of real-world\nsamples. In this paper, we propose to train DL-based vulnerability detection\nmodels in a human-learning manner, that is, start with the simplest samples and\nthen gradually transition to difficult knowledge. Specifically, we design a\nnovel framework (Humer) that can enhance the detection ability of DL-based\nvulnerability detectors. To validate the effectiveness of Humer, we select five\nstate-of-the-art DL-based vulnerability detection models (TokenCNN,\nVulDeePecker, StatementGRU, ASTGRU, and Devign) to complete our evaluations.\nThrough the results, we find that the use of Humer can increase the F1 of these\nmodels by an average of 10.5%. Moreover, Humer can make the model detect up to\n16.7% more real-world vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, we also conduct a case study\nto uncover vulnerabilities from real-world open source products by using these\nenhanced DL-based vulnerability detectors. Through the results, we finally\ndiscover 281 unreported vulnerabilities in NVD, of which 98 have been silently\npatched by vendors in the latest version of corresponding products, but 159\nstill exist in the products.",

Despite the encouraging results\nachieved, state-of-the-art DFKD methods still suffer from the inefficiency of\ndata synthesis, making the data-free training process extremely time-consuming\nand thus inapplicable for large-scale tasks. In this work, we introduce an\nefficacious scheme, termed as FastDFKD, that allows us to accelerate DFKD by a\nfactor of orders of magnitude. At the heart of our approach is a novel strategy\nto reuse the shared common features in training data so as to synthesize\ndifferent data instances. Unlike prior methods that optimize a set of data\nindependently, we propose to learn a meta-synthesizer that seeks common\nfeatures as the initialization for the fast data synthesis. As a result,\nFastDFKD achieves data synthesis within only a few steps, significantly\nenhancing the efficiency of data-free training. Experiments over CIFAR, NYUv2,\nand ImageNet demonstrate that the proposed FastDFKD achieves 10$\\times$ and\neven 100$\\times$ acceleration while preserving performances on par with state\nof the art.",

    "abstract": "Observations of seabed texture with synthetic aperture sonar are dependent\nupon several factors. In this work, we focus on collection geometry with\nrespect to isotropic and anisotropic textures. The low grazing angle of the\ncollection geometry, combined with orientation of the sonar path relative to\nanisotropic texture, poses a significant challenge for image-alignment and\nother multi-view scene understanding frameworks. We previously proposed using\nfeatures captured from estimated seabed relief to improve scene understanding.\nWhile several methods have been developed to estimate seabed relief via\nintensity, no large-scale study exists in the literature. Furthermore, a\ndataset of coregistered seabed relief maps and sonar imagery is nonexistent to\nlearn this domain translation. We address these problems by producing a large\nsimulated dataset containing coregistered pairs of seabed relief and intensity\nmaps from two unique sonar data simulation techniques. We apply three types of\nmodels, with varying complexity, to translate intensity imagery to seabed\nrelief: a Gaussian Markov Random Field approach (GMRF), a conditional\nGenerative Adversarial Network (cGAN), and UNet architectures. Methods are\ncompared in reference to the coregistered simulated datasets using L1 error.\nAdditionally, predictions on simulated and real SAS imagery are shown. Finally,\nmodels are compared on two datasets of hand-aligned SAS imagery and evaluated\nin terms of L1 error across multiple aspects in comparison to using intensity.\nOur comprehensive experiments show that the proposed UNet architectures\noutperform the GMRF and pix2pix cGAN models on seabed relief estimation for\nsimulated and real SAS imagery.",

    "abstract": "Natural Language Interfaces to Databases (NLIDBs), where users pose queries\nin Natural Language (NL), are crucial for enabling non-experts to gain insights\nfrom data. Developing such interfaces, by contrast, is dependent on experts who\noften code heuristics for mapping NL to SQL. Alternatively, NLIDBs based on\nmachine learning models rely on supervised examples of NL to SQL mappings\n(NL-SQL pairs) used as training data. Such examples are again procured using\nexperts, which typically involves more than a one-off interaction. Namely, each\ndata domain in which the NLIDB is deployed may have different characteristics\nand therefore require either dedicated heuristics or domain-specific training\nexamples. To this end, we propose an alternative approach for training machine\nlearning-based NLIDBs, using weak supervision. We use the recently proposed\nquestion decomposition representation called QDMR, an intermediate between NL\nand formal query languages. Recent work has shown that non-experts are\ngenerally successful in translating NL to QDMR. We consequently use NL-QDMR\npairs, along with the question answers, as supervision for automatically\nsynthesizing SQL queries. The NL questions and synthesized SQL are then used to\ntrain NL-to-SQL models, which we test on five benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "We present an accelerated and hardware parallelized integral-equation solver\nfor the problem of acoustic scattering by a two-dimensional surface in\nthree-dimensional space. The approach is based, in part, on the novel\nInterpolated Factored Green Function acceleration method (IFGF) that, without\nrecourse to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), evaluates the action of Green\nfunction-based integral operators for an $N$-point surface discretization at a\ncomplexity of $\\Ord(N\\log N)$ operations instead of the $\\Ord(N^2)$ cost\nassociated with nonaccelerated methods. The IFGF algorithm exploits the slow\nvariations of factored Green functions to enable the fast evaluation of fields\ngenerated by groups of sources on the basis of a recursive interpolation\nscheme. In the proposed approach, the IFGF method is used to account for the\nvast majority of the computations, while, for the relatively few singular,\nnearly-singular and neighboring non-singular integral operator evaluations, a\nhigh-order rectangular-polar quadrature approach is employed instead. Since the\noverall approach does not rely on the FFT, it is amenable to efficient shared-\nand distributed-memory parallelization; this paper demonstrates such a\ncapability by means of an OpenMP parallel implementation of the method. A\nvariety of numerical examples presented in this paper demonstrate that the\nproposed methods enable the efficient solution of large problems over complex\ngeometries on small parallel hardware infrastructures. Numerical examples\ninclude acoustic scattering by a sphere of up to $128$ wavelengths, an\n$80$-wavelength submarine, and a turbofan nacelle that is more than $80$\nwavelengths in size, requiring, on a 28-core computer, computing times of the\norder of a few minutes per iteration and a few tens of iterations of the GMRES\niterative solver.",

However, such generative\ncommonsense reasoning (GCSR) skills are lacking in state-of-the-art text\ngeneration methods. Descriptive sentences about arbitrary concepts generated by\nneural text generation models (e.g., pre-trained text-to-text Transformers) are\noften grammatically fluent but may not correspond to human common sense,\nlargely due to their lack of mechanisms to capture concept relations, to\nidentify implicit concepts, and to perform generalizable reasoning about unseen\nconcept compositions.

More recently, Chou, Golovnev,\nSudan, and Velusamy [CGSV21] proved a general dichotomy theorem tightly\ncharacterizing the approximability of Boolean Max-CSPs with respect to\nsketching algorithms. For every $f$, they showed that there exists an optimal\napproximation ratio $\\alpha(f)\\in (0,1]$ such that for every $\\epsilon>0$,\nMax-CSP($f$) is $(\\alpha(f)-\\epsilon)$-approximable by a linear sketching\nalgorithm in $O(\\log n)$ space, but any $(\\alpha(f)+\\epsilon)$-approximation\nsketching algorithm for Max-CSP($f$) requires $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ space.\nIn this work, we build on the [CGSV21] dichotomy theorem and give closed-form\nexpressions for the sketching approximation ratios of multiple families of\nsymmetric Boolean functions.

    "abstract": "Video anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal events that occurred in\nvideos. Since anomalous events are relatively rare, it is not feasible to\ncollect a balanced dataset and train a binary classifier to solve the task.\nThus, most previous approaches learn only from normal videos using unsupervised\nor semi-supervised methods. Obviously, they are limited in capturing and\nutilizing discriminative abnormal characteristics, which leads to compromised\nanomaly detection performance. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose\na new learning paradigm by making full use of both normal and abnormal videos\nfor video anomaly detection. In particular, we formulate a new learning task:\ncross-domain few-shot anomaly detection, which can transfer knowledge learned\nfrom numerous videos in the source domain to help solve few-shot abnormality\ndetection in the target domain. Concretely, we leverage self-supervised\ntraining on the target normal videos to reduce the domain gap and devise a meta\ncontext perception module to explore the video context of the event in the\nfew-shot setting. Our experiments show that our method significantly\noutperforms baseline methods on DoTA and UCF-Crime datasets, and the new task\ncontributes to a more practical training paradigm for anomaly detection.",

However, models trained with AT sacrifice\nstandard accuracy and do not generalize well to novel attacks. Recent works\nshow generalization improvement with adversarial samples under novel threat\nmodels such as on-manifold threat model or neural perceptual threat model.\nHowever, the former requires exact manifold information while the latter\nrequires algorithm relaxation. Motivated by these considerations, we exploit\nthe underlying manifold information with Normalizing Flow, ensuring that exact\nmanifold assumption holds.

Under JSTM, we develop novel\nadversarial attacks and defenses. The mixup strategy improves the standard\naccuracy of neural networks but sacrifices robustness when combined with AT. To\ntackle this issue, we propose the Robust Mixup strategy in which we maximize\nthe adversity of the interpolated images and gain robustness and prevent\noverfitting.

    "abstract": "The Earth's surface is continually changing, and identifying changes plays an\nimportant role in urban planning and sustainability. Although change detection\ntechniques have been successfully developed for many years, these techniques\nare still limited to experts and facilitators in related fields. In order to\nprovide every user with flexible access to change information and help them\nbetter understand land-cover changes, we introduce a novel task: change\ndetection-based visual question answering (CDVQA) on multi-temporal aerial\nimages. In particular, multi-temporal images can be queried to obtain high\nlevel change-based information according to content changes between two input\nimages. We first build a CDVQA dataset including multi-temporal\nimage-question-answer triplets using an automatic question-answer generation\nmethod. Then, a baseline CDVQA framework is devised in this work, and it\ncontains four parts: multi-temporal feature encoding, multi-temporal fusion,\nmulti-modal fusion, and answer prediction. In addition, we also introduce a\nchange enhancing module to multi-temporal feature encoding, aiming at\nincorporating more change-related information. Finally, effects of different\nbackbones and multi-temporal fusion strategies are studied on the performance\nof CDVQA task. The experimental results provide useful insights for developing\nbetter CDVQA models, which are important for future research on this task. We\nwill make our dataset and code publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Location data is inherently uncertain for many reasons including 1) imprecise\nlocation measurements, 2) obsolete observations that are often interpolated,\nand 3) deliberate obfuscation to preserve location privacy. What makes handling\nuncertainty data challenging is the exponentially large number of possible\nworlds, which lies in O(2^N), for a database having N uncertain objects as it\nhas been shown that general query processing in uncertain spatial data is\nNP-hard. Many applications using spatial data require counting the number of\nspatial objects within a region. An example is the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)\nquery: Asking if an object A is a kNN of another object Q is equivalent to\nasking whether no more than k-1 objects are located inside the circle centered\nat Q having a radius equal to the distance between Q and A.\nFor this problem of counting uncertain objects within a region, an efficient\nsolution based on Generating Functions has been proposed and successfully used\nin many applications, including range-count queries, kNN queries, distance\nranking queries, and reverse kNN queries. This spatial gem describes the\ngenerating function technique for probabilistic counting and provides examples\nand implementation details.",

Such a pricing scheme provides users with incentives to invest in\nbehind-the-meter energy storage and to shift peak load towards low-price\nintervals.

We propose leveraging a unified text-to-text Transformer for LJP,\nwhere the dependencies among sub-tasks can be naturally established within the\nauto-regressive decoder.

Through an extensive set of\nexperiments, we find that the best order to capture dependencies is different\nfrom human intuitions, and the most reasonable logical order for humans can be\nsub-optimal for the model.

Using these\npredictions, the gripper is commanded with a safe grasping strength for the\ngrasping tasks via inference.

    "abstract": "In LiDAR-based 3D object detection for autonomous driving, the ratio of the\nobject size to input scene size is significantly smaller compared to 2D\ndetection cases. Overlooking this difference, many 3D detectors directly follow\nthe common practice of 2D detectors, which downsample the feature maps even\nafter quantizing the point clouds. In this paper, we start by rethinking how\nsuch multi-stride stereotype affects the LiDAR-based 3D object detectors. Our\nexperiments point out that the downsampling operations bring few advantages,\nand lead to inevitable information loss. To remedy this issue, we propose\nSingle-stride Sparse Transformer (SST) to maintain the original resolution from\nthe beginning to the end of the network. Armed with transformers, our method\naddresses the problem of insufficient receptive field in single-stride\narchitectures. It also cooperates well with the sparsity of point clouds and\nnaturally avoids expensive computation. Eventually, our SST achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on the large scale Waymo Open Dataset. It is worth\nmentioning that our method can achieve exciting performance (83.8 LEVEL 1 AP on\nvalidation split) on small object (pedestrian) detection due to the\ncharacteristic of single stride.

With the help\nof graph theory, a method is proposed that automatically splits a complex line\ntopology with branches into several one-dimensional lines. The problem of\nshort-circuit fault location in the branching lines is then transformed into\nseveral one-dimensional optimization problems, which are then solved by the\noptimization algorithm. This solves the problem of realizing rapid location in\na power network with branches. Numerical experiments are carried out in a\ndistribution network model to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.\nResults under different conditions show the method works reliably and\nefficiently.",

    "title": "Dynamic Exploitation Gaussian Bare-Bones Bat Algorithm for Optimal  Reactive Power Dispatch to Improve the Safety and Stability of Power System",
    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel Gaussian bare-bones bat algorithm (GBBBA) and its\nmodified version named as dynamic exploitation Gaussian bare-bones bat\nalgorithm (DeGBBBA) are proposed for solving optimal reactive power dispatch\n(ORPD) problem. The optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) plays a fundamental\nrole in ensuring stable, secure, reliable as well as economical operation of\nthe power system. The ORPD problem is formulated as a complex and nonlinear\noptimization problem of mixed integers including both discrete and continuous\ncontrol variables. Bat algorithm (BA) is one of the most popular metaheuristic\nalgorithms which mimics the echolocation of the microbats and which has also\noutperformed some other metaheuristic algorithms in solving various\noptimization problems. Nevertheless, the standard BA may fail to balance\nexploration and exploitation for some optimization problems and hence it may\noften fall into local optima. The proposed GBBBA employs the Gaussian\ndistribution in updating the bat positions in an effort to mitigate the\npremature convergence problem associated with the standard BA. The GBBBA takes\nadvantages of Gaussian sampling which begins from exploration and continues to\nexploitation. DeGBBBA is an advanced variant of GBBBA in which a modified\nGaussian distribution is introduced so as to allow the dynamic adaptation of\nexploitation and exploitation in the proposed algorithm. Both GBBBA and DeGBBBA\nare used to determine the optimal settings of generator bus voltages, tap\nsetting transformers and shunt reactive sources in order to minimize the active\npower loss, total voltage deviations and voltage stability index. Simulation\nresults show that GBBBA and DeGBBBA are robust and effective in solving the\nORPD problem.",

    "abstract": "The training and test data for deep-neural-network-based classifiers are\nusually assumed to be sampled from the same distribution. When part of the test\nsamples are drawn from a distribution that is sufficiently far away from that\nof the training samples (a.k.a. out-of-distribution (OOD) samples), the trained\nneural network has a tendency to make high confidence predictions for these OOD\nsamples. Detection of the OOD samples is critical when training a neural\nnetwork used for image classification, object detection, etc. It can enhance\nthe classifier's robustness to irrelevant inputs, and improve the system\nresilience and security under different forms of attacks. Detection of OOD\nsamples has three main challenges: (i) the proposed OOD detection method should\nbe compatible with various architectures of classifiers (e.g., DenseNet,\nResNet), without significantly increasing the model complexity and requirements\non computational resources; (ii) the OOD samples may come from multiple\ndistributions, whose class labels are commonly unavailable; (iii) a score\nfunction needs to be defined to effectively separate OOD samples from\nin-distribution (InD) samples. To overcome these challenges, we propose a\nWasserstein-based out-of-distribution detection (WOOD) method. The basic idea\nis to define a Wasserstein-distance-based score that evaluates the\ndissimilarity between a test sample and the distribution of InD samples. An\noptimization problem is then formulated and solved based on the proposed score\nfunction. The statistical learning bound of the proposed method is investigated\nto guarantee that the loss value achieved by the empirical optimizer\napproximates the global optimum. The comparison study results demonstrate that\nthe proposed WOOD consistently outperforms other existing OOD detection\nmethods.",

However, most existing methods are based on static word\nco-occurrence graphs without sentence-level information, which poses three\nchallenges:(1) word ambiguity, (2) word synonymity, and (3) dynamic contextual\ndependency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel GNN-based sparse\nstructure learning model for inductive document classification. Specifically, a\ndocument-level graph is initially generated by a disjoint union of\nsentence-level word co-occurrence graphs. Our model collects a set of trainable\nedges connecting disjoint words between sentences and employs structure\nlearning to sparsely select edges with dynamic contextual dependencies. Graphs\nwith sparse structures can jointly exploit local and global contextual\ninformation in documents through GNNs. For inductive learning, the refined\ndocument graph is further fed into a general readout function for graph-level\nclassification and optimization in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments\non several real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms\nmost state-of-the-art results, and reveal the necessity to learn sparse\nstructures for each document.",

    "abstract": "For consensus on measurement-based distributed filtering (CMDF), through\ninfinite consensus fusion operations during each sampling interval, each node\nin the sensor network can achieve optimal filtering performance with\ncentralized filtering. However, due to the limited communication resources in\nphysical systems, the number of fusion steps cannot be infinite. To deal with\nthis issue, the present paper analyzes the performance of CMDF with finite\nconsensus fusion operations. First, by introducing a modified discrete-time\nalgebraic Riccati equation and several novel techniques, the convergence of the\nestimation error covariance matrix of each sensor is guaranteed under a\ncollective observability condition. In particular, the steady-state covariance\nmatrix can be simplified as the solution to a discrete-time Lyapunov equation.\nMoreover, the performance degradation induced by reduced fusion frequency is\nobtained in closed form, which establishes an analytical relation between the\nperformance of the CMDF with finite fusion steps and that of centralized\nfiltering. Meanwhile, it provides a trade-off between the filtering performance\nand the communication cost. Furthermore, it is shown that the steady-state\nestimation error covariance matrix exponentially converges to the centralized\noptimal steady-state matrix with fusion operations tending to infinity during\neach sampling interval.

    "title": "Does Fully Homomorphic Encryption Need Compute Acceleration?",
    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows arbitrarily complex computations on\nencrypted data without ever needing to decrypt it, thus enabling us to maintain\ndata privacy on third-party systems. Unfortunately, sustaining deep\ncomputations with FHE requires a periodic noise reduction step known as\nbootstrapping. The cost of the bootstrapping operation is one of the primary\nbarriers to the wide-spread adoption of FHE. In this paper, we present an\nin-depth architectural analysis of the bootstrapping step in FHE. First, we\nobserve that secure implementations of bootstrapping exhibit a low arithmetic\nintensity (<1 Op/byte), require large caches (>100 MB) and as such, are heavily\nbound by the main memory bandwidth. Consequently, we demonstrate that existing\nworkloads observe marginal performance gains from the design of bespoke\nhigh-throughput arithmetic units tailored to FHE. Secondly, we propose several\ncache-friendly algorithmic optimizations that improve the throughput in FHE\nbootstrapping by enabling up to 3.2x higher arithmetic intensity and 4.6x lower\nmemory bandwidth. Our optimizations apply to a wide range of structurally\nsimilar computations such as private evaluation and training of machine\nlearning models. Finally, we incorporate these optimizations into an\narchitectural tool which, given a cache size, memory subsystem, the number of\nfunctional units and a desired security level, selects optimal cryptosystem\nparameters to maximize the bootstrapping throughput. Our optimized\nbootstrapping implementation represents a best-case scenario for compute\nacceleration of FHE. We show that despite these optimizations, bootstrapping\ncontinues to remain bottlenecked by main memory bandwidth. We thus conclude\nthat secure FHE implementations need to look beyond accelerated compute for\nfurther performance improvements and propose new research directions to address\nthe underlying memory bottleneck.",

    "abstract": "In order to achieve reliable communication with a high data rate of massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in frequency division duplex\n(FDD) mode, the estimated channel state information (CSI) at the receiver needs\nto be fed back to the transmitter. However, the feedback overhead becomes\nexorbitant with the increasing number of antennas. In this paper, a two stages\nlow rank (TSLR) CSI feedback scheme for millimeter wave (mmWave) massive MIMO\nsystems is proposed to reduce the feedback overhead based on model-driven deep\nlearning. Besides, we design a deep iterative neural network, named FISTA-Net,\nby unfolding the fast iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (FISTA) to\nachieve more efficient CSI feedback. Moreover, a shrinkage thresholding network\n(ST-Net) is designed in FISTA-Net based on the attention mechanism, which can\nchoose the threshold adaptively. Simulation results show that the proposed TSLR\nCSI feedback scheme and FISTA-Net outperform the existing algorithms in various\nscenarios.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid atlas\nbuilding algorithm that fast estimates atlas from large-scale image datasets\nwith much reduced computational cost. In contrast to previous approaches that\niteratively perform registration tasks between an estimated atlas and\nindividual images, we propose to use learned priors of registration from\npre-trained neural networks. This newly developed hybrid framework features\nseveral advantages of (i) providing an efficient way of atlas building without\nlosing the quality of results, and (ii) offering flexibility in utilizing a\nwide variety of deep learning based registration methods.

    "abstract": "Software 2.0 is a fundamental shift in software engineering where machine\nlearning becomes the new software, powered by big data and computing\ninfrastructure. As a result, software engineering needs to be re-thought where\ndata becomes a first-class citizen on par with code. One striking observation\nis that 80-90% of the machine learning process is spent on data preparation.\nWithout good data, even the best machine learning algorithms cannot perform\nwell. As a result, data-centric AI practices are now becoming mainstream.\nUnfortunately, many datasets in the real world are small, dirty, biased, and\neven poisoned. In this survey, we study the research landscape for data\ncollection and data quality primarily for deep learning applications. Data\ncollection is important because there is lesser need for feature engineering\nfor recent deep learning approaches, but instead more need for large amounts of\ndata. For data quality, we study data validation and data cleaning techniques.\nEven if the data cannot be fully cleaned, we can still cope with imperfect data\nduring model training where using robust model training techniques. In\naddition, while bias and fairness have been less studied in traditional data\nmanagement research, these issues become essential topics in modern machine\nlearning applications. We thus study fairness measures and unfairness\nmitigation techniques that can be applied before, during, or after model\ntraining. We believe that the data management community is well poised to solve\nproblems in these directions.",

A standard description of fluid dynamics requires\nsolving the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in different flow regimes. However,\napplications of CFD simulations are computationally-limited by the\navailability, speed, and parallelism of high-performance computing. To improve\ncomputational efficiency, machine learning techniques have been used to create\naccelerated data-driven approximations for CFD. A majority of such approaches\nrely on large labeled CFD datasets that are expensive to obtain at the scale\nnecessary to build robust data-driven models. We develop a weakly-supervised\napproach to solve the steady-state N-S equations under various boundary\nconditions, using a multi-channel input with boundary and geometric conditions.\nWe achieve state-of-the-art results without any labeled simulation data, but\nusing a custom data-driven and physics-informed loss function by using and\nsmall-scale solutions to prime the model to solve the N-S equations. To improve\nthe resolution and predictability, we train stacked models of increasing\ncomplexity generating the numerical solutions for N-S equations. Without\nexpensive computations, our model achieves high predictability with a variety\nof obstacles and boundary conditions. Given its high flexibility, the model can\ngenerate a solution on a 64 x 64 domain within 5 ms on a regular desktop\ncomputer which is 1000 times faster than a regular CFD solver.

In this paper, we systematically studied a wide\ncollection of policy-switching approaches, including theoretically guided\ncriteria, policy-difference-based methods, and non-adaptive baselines.

Given its inherent nature, social distancing measures are proposed as\nthe primary strategies to curb the spread of this pandemic. Therefore,\nidentifying situations where these protocols are violated, has implications for\ncurtailing the spread of the disease and promoting a sustainable lifestyle.\nThis paper proposes a novel computer vision-based system to analyze CCTV\nfootage to provide a threat level assessment of COVID-19 spread. The system\nstrives to holistically capture and interpret the information content of CCTV\nfootage spanning multiple frames to recognize instances of various violations\nof social distancing protocols, across time and space, as well as\nidentification of group behaviors. This functionality is achieved primarily by\nutilizing a temporal graph-based structure to represent the information of the\nCCTV footage and a strategy to holistically interpret the graph and quantify\nthe threat level of the given scene. The individual components are tested and\nvalidated on a range of scenarios and the complete system is tested against\nhuman expert opinion. The results reflect the dependence of the threat level on\npeople, their physical proximity, interactions, protective clothing, and group\ndynamics. The system performance has an accuracy of 76%, thus enabling a\ndeployable threat monitoring system in cities, to permit normalcy and\nsustainability in the society.",

    "abstract": "We achieved contact-rich flexible object manipulation, which was difficult to\ncontrol with vision alone. In the unzipping task we chose as a validation task,\nthe gripper grasps the puller, which hides the bag state such as the direction\nand amount of deformation behind it, making it difficult to obtain information\nto perform the task by vision alone. Additionally, the flexible fabric bag\nstate constantly changes during operation, so the robot needs to dynamically\nrespond to the change. However, the appropriate robot behavior for all bag\nstates is difficult to prepare in advance. To solve this problem, we developed\na model that can perform contact-rich flexible object manipulation by real-time\nprediction of vision with tactility. We introduced a point-based attention\nmechanism for extracting image features, softmax transformation for predicting\nmotions, and convolutional neural network for extracting tactile features. The\nresults of experiments using a real robot arm revealed that our method can\nrealize motions responding to the deformation of the bag while reducing the\nload on the zipper. Furthermore, using tactility improved the success rate from\n56.7% to 93.3% compared with vision alone, demonstrating the effectiveness and\nhigh performance of our method.",

    "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are vulnerable to audio\nadversarial examples that attempt to deceive ASR systems by adding\nperturbations to benign speech signals. Although an adversarial example and the\noriginal benign wave are indistinguishable to humans, the former is transcribed\nas a malicious target sentence by ASR systems. Several methods have been\nproposed to generate audio adversarial examples and feed them directly into the\nASR system (over-line). Furthermore, many researchers have demonstrated the\nfeasibility of robust physical audio adversarial examples(over-air). To defend\nagainst the attacks, several studies have been proposed. However, deploying\nthem in a real-world situation is difficult because of accuracy drop or time\noverhead. In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect audio adversarial\nexamples by adding noise to the logits before feeding them into the decoder of\nthe ASR. We show that carefully selected noise can significantly impact the\ntranscription results of the audio adversarial examples, whereas it has minimal\nimpact on the transcription results of benign audio waves. Based on this\ncharacteristic, we detect audio adversarial examples by comparing the\ntranscription altered by logit noising with its original transcription. The\nproposed method can be easily applied to ASR systems without any structural\nchanges or additional training. The experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod is robust to over-line audio adversarial examples as well as over-air\naudio adversarial examples compared with state-of-the-art detection methods.",

In\nthis paper, we respond to the intriguing learning-related question -- if\nleveraging both accessible unpaired over/underexposed images and high-level\nsemantic guidance, can improve the performance of cutting-edge LLE models?\nHere, we propose an effective semantically contrastive learning paradigm for\nLLE (namely SCL-LLE). Beyond the existing LLE wisdom, it casts the image\nenhancement task as multi-task joint learning, where LLE is converted into\nthree constraints of contrastive learning, semantic brightness consistency, and\nfeature preservation for simultaneously ensuring the exposure, texture, and\ncolor consistency. SCL-LLE allows the LLE model to learn from unpaired\npositives (normal-light)/negatives (over/underexposed), and enables it to\ninteract with the scene semantics to regularize the image enhancement network,\nyet the interaction of high-level semantic knowledge and the low-level signal\nprior is seldom investigated in previous methods. Training on readily available\nopen data, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the\nstate-of-the-arts LLE models over six independent cross-scenes datasets.\nMoreover, SCL-LLE's potential to benefit the downstream semantic segmentation\nunder extremely dark conditions is discussed.

However, the amount of exploration\nrequired for learning is often quite large. Deep reinforcement learning also\nhas super-human performance in that no human being would be able to achieve\nsuch amounts of exploration. To address this problem, we focus on the\n\\textit{satisficing} policy, which is a qualitatively different approach from\nthat of existing optimization algorithms. Thus, we propose Linear RS (LinRS),\nwhich is a type of satisficing algorithm and a linear extension of\nrisk-sensitive satisficing (RS), for application to a wider range of tasks. The\ngeneralization of RS provides an algorithm to reduce the volume of exploratory\nactions by adopting a different approach from existing optimization algorithms.\nLinRS utilizes linear regression and multiclass classification to linearly\napproximate both the action value and proportion of action selections required\nin the RS calculation. The results of our experiments indicate that LinRS\nreduced the number of explorations and run time compared to those of existing\nalgorithms in contextual bandit problems.

However, the rapid\nevolution of industrial components, together with the new paradigm of Industry\n4.0, and the new connectivity features that will be introduced by the 5G\ntechnology, all increase the likelihood of security incidents. These incidents\nare caused by the vulnerabilities present in these devices. In addition,\nalthough international standards define tasks to assess vulnerabilities, they\ndo not specify any particular method. Having a secure design is important, but\nis also complex, costly, and an extra factor to manage during the lifespan of\nthe device. This paper presents a model to analyze the known vulnerabilities of\nindustrial components over time. The proposed model is based on two main\nelements: a directed graph representation of the internal structure of the\ncomponent, and a set of quantitative metrics that are based on international\nsecurity standards; such as, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).\nThis model is applied throughout the entire lifespan of a device to track\nvulnerabilities, identify new requirements, root causes, and test cases. The\nproposed model also helps to prioritize patching activities. To test its\npotential, the proposed model is applied to the OpenPLC project. The results\nshow that most of the root causes of these vulnerabilities are related to\nmemory buffer operations and are concentrated in the \\textit{libssl} library.\nConsequently, new requirements and test cases were generated from the obtained\ndata.",

    "abstract": "Deep discriminative models (DDMs), such as deep regression forests, deep\nneural decision forests, have been extensively studied recently to solve\nproblems like facial age estimation, head pose estimation, gaze estimation and\nso forth. Such problems are challenging in part because a large amount of\neffective training data without noise and bias is often not available. While\nsome progress has been achieved through learning more discriminative features,\nor reweighting samples, we argue what is more desirable is to learn gradually\nto discriminate like human beings. Then, we resort to self-paced learning\n(SPL). But a natural question arises: can self-paced regime lead DDMs to\nachieve more robust and less biased solutions? A serious problem with SPL,\nwhich is firstly discussed by this work, is it tends to aggravate the bias of\nsolutions, especially for obvious imbalanced data. To this end, this paper\nproposes a new self-paced paradigm for deep discriminative model, which\ndistinguishes noisy and underrepresented examples according to the output\nlikelihood and entropy associated with each example, and tackle the fundamental\nranking problem in SPL from a new perspective: fairness. This paradigm is\nfundamental, and could be easily combined with a variety of DDMs. Extensive\nexperiments on three computer vision tasks, such as facial age estimation, head\npose estimation and gaze estimation, demonstrate the efficacy of our paradigm.\nTo the best of our knowledge, our work is the first paper in the literature of\nSPL that considers ranking fairness for self-paced regime construction.",

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation can capture user chronological preferences from\ntheir historical behaviors, yet the learning of short sequences is still an\nopen challenge. Recently, data augmentation with pseudo-prior items generated\nby transformers has drawn considerable attention in improving recommendation in\nshort sequences and addressing the cold-start problem. These methods typically\ngenerate pseudo-prior items sequentially in reverse chronological order (i.e.,\nfrom the future to the past) to obtain longer sequences for subsequent\nlearning. However, the performance can still degrade for very short sequences\nthan for longer ones. In fact, reverse sequential augmentation does not\nexplicitly take into account the forward direction, and so the underlying\ntemporal correlations may not be fully preserved in terms of conditional\nprobabilities. In this paper, we propose a Bidirectional Chronological\nAugmentation of Transformer (BiCAT) that uses a forward learning constraint in\nthe reverse generative process to capture contextual information more\neffectively. The forward constraint serves as a bridge between reverse data\naugmentation and forward recommendation. It can also be used as pretraining to\nfacilitate subsequent learning. Extensive experiments on two public datasets\nwith detailed comparisons to multiple baseline models demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method, especially for very short sequences (3 or fewer\nitems).",

    "abstract": "Along with the rapid progress of visual tracking, existing benchmarks become\nless informative due to redundancy of samples and weak discrimination between\ncurrent trackers, making evaluations on all datasets extremely time-consuming.\nThus, a small and informative benchmark, which covers all typical challenging\nscenarios to facilitate assessing the tracker performance, is of great\ninterest. In this work, we develop a principled way to construct a small and\ninformative tracking benchmark (ITB) with 7% out of 1.2 M frames of existing\nand newly collected datasets, which enables efficient evaluation while ensuring\neffectiveness. Specifically, we first design a quality assessment mechanism to\nselect the most informative sequences from existing benchmarks taking into\naccount 1) challenging level, 2) discriminative strength, 3) and density of\nappearance variations. Furthermore, we collect additional sequences to ensure\nthe diversity and balance of tracking scenarios, leading to a total of 20\nsequences for each scenario. By analyzing the results of 15 state-of-the-art\ntrackers re-trained on the same data, we determine the effective methods for\nrobust tracking under each scenario and demonstrate new challenges for future\nresearch direction in this field.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Multi-modal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) has attracted a lot of\nattention. Most of the work utilizes image information through region-level\nvisual representations obtained from a pretrained object detector and relies on\nan attention mechanism to model the interactions between image and text\nrepresentations. However, it is difficult to model such interactions as image\nand text representations are trained separately on the data of their respective\nmodality and are not aligned in the same space. As text representations take\nthe most important role in MNER, in this paper, we propose {\\bf I}mage-{\\bf\nt}ext {\\bf A}lignments (ITA) to align image features into the textual space, so\nthat the attention mechanism in transformer-based pretrained textual embeddings\ncan be better utilized. ITA first locally and globally aligns regional object\ntags and image-level captions as visual contexts, concatenates them with the\ninput texts as a new cross-modal input, and then feeds it into a pretrained\ntextual embedding model. This makes it easier for the attention module of a\npretrained textual embedding model to model the interaction between the two\nmodalities since they are both represented in the textual space. ITA further\naligns the output distributions predicted from the cross-modal input and\ntextual input views so that the MNER model can be more practical and robust to\nnoises from images. In our experiments, we show that ITA models can achieve\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on multi-modal Named Entity Recognition datasets,\neven without image information.",

    "abstract": "Since security has been one of the crucial issues for high-yield\ncommunications such as 5G and 6G, the researchers continuously come up with\nnewer techniques to enhance the security and performance of these progressive\nwireless communications. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is one of\nthose techniques that artificially rearrange and optimize the propagation\nenvironment of electromagnetic waves to improve both spectrum and energy\nefficiency of wireless networks. Besides, in underwater communication,\nunderwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) is a better\nalternative/replacement for conventional acoustic and radio frequency (RF)\ntechnologies. Hence, mixed RIS-aided RF-UOWC can be treated as a promising\ntechnology for future wireless networks. This work focuses on the secrecy\nperformance of mixed dual-hop RIS-aided RF-UOWC networks under the intercepting\neffort of a probable eavesdropper. The RF link operates under generalized Gamma\nfading distribution; likewise, the UOWC link experiences the mixture\nexponential generalized Gamma distribution. The secrecy analysis subsumes the\nderivations of closed-form expressions for average secrecy capacity, exact and\nlower bound of secrecy outage probability, and strictly positive secrecy\ncapacity, all in terms of Meijer G functions. Capitalizing on these\nderivations, the effects of heterodyne and intensity modulation/direct\ndetection systems, underwater turbulence resulting from air bubble levels,\ntemperature gradients, and salinity gradients, are measured. Unlike\nconventional models that merely deal with thermally uniform scenarios, this\nproposed model is likely to be unique in terms of dealing with secrecy analysis\nof a temperature gradient RIS-aided RF-UOWC network.

We proposed a novel method, dubbed Cross-Modal Info-Max\nHashing (CMIMH). First, to learn informative representations that can preserve\nboth intra- and inter-modal similarities, we leverage the recent advances in\nestimating variational lower-bound of MI to maximize the MI between the binary\nrepresentations and input features and between binary representations of\ndifferent modalities. By jointly maximizing these MIs under the assumption that\nthe binary representations are modelled by multivariate Bernoulli\ndistributions, we can learn binary representations, which can preserve both\nintra- and inter-modal similarities, effectively in a mini-batch manner with\ngradient descent. Furthermore, we find out that trying to minimize the modality\ngap by learning similar binary representations for the same instance from\ndifferent modalities could result in less informative representations. Hence,\nbalancing between reducing the modality gap and losing modality-private\ninformation is important for the cross-modal retrieval tasks. Quantitative\nevaluations on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method\nconsistently outperforms other state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval methods.",

    "abstract": "We provide an in-depth study of Nash equilibria in multi-objective normal\nform games (MONFGs), i.e., normal form games with vectorial payoffs. Taking a\nutility-based approach, we assume that each player's utility can be modelled\nwith a utility function that maps a vector to a scalar utility. We note though\nthat in the case of a mixed strategy, it is meaningful to apply such a\nscalarisation both before calculating the expectation of the payoff vector as\nwell as after. This distinction leads to two optimisation criteria. With the\nfirst criterion, players aim to optimise the expected value of their utility\nfunction applied to the payoff vectors obtained in the game. With the second\ncriterion, players aim to optimise the utility of expected payoff vectors given\na joint strategy. Under this latter criterion, it was shown that Nash\nequilibria need not exist. Our first contribution is to provide two different\nsufficient conditions under which Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist.\nSecondly, we show that when Nash equilibria do exist under both criteria, no\nequilibrium needs to be shared between the two criteria, and even the number of\nequilibria can differ. Thirdly, we contribute a study of pure strategy Nash\nequilibria under both criteria. We show that when assuming quasiconvex utility\nfunctions for players, the sets of pure strategy Nash equilibria under both\noptimisation criteria are equivalent. This result is further extended to games\nin which players adhere to different optimisation criteria. Finally, given\nthese theoretical results, we construct an algorithm to find all pure strategy\nNash equilibria in MONFGs where players have a quasiconvex utility function.",

    "abstract": "In many applications of aerial/satellite image analysis (remote sensing), the\ngeneration of exact shapes of objects is a cumbersome task. In most remote\nsensing applications such as counting objects requires only location estimation\nof objects. Hence, locating object centroids in aerial/satellite images is an\neasy solution for tasks where the object's exact shape is not necessary. Thus,\nthis study focuses on assessing the feasibility of using deep neural networks\nfor locating object centroids in satellite images. Name of our model is\nCentroid-UNet. The Centroid-UNet model is based on classic U-Net semantic\nsegmentation architecture. We modified and adapted the U-Net semantic\nsegmentation architecture into a centroid detection model preserving the\nsimplicity of the original model. Furthermore, we have tested and evaluated our\nmodel with two case studies involving aerial/satellite images. Those two case\nstudies are building centroid detection case study and coconut tree centroid\ndetection case study. Our evaluation results have reached comparably good\naccuracy compared to other methods, and also offer simplicity. The code and\nmodels developed under this study are also available in the Centroid-UNet\nGitHub repository: https://github.com/gicait/centroid-unet",

    "abstract": "The 360 imaging has recently gained great attention; however, its angular\nresolution is relatively lower than that of a narrow field-of-view (FOV)\nperspective image as it is captured by using fisheye lenses with the same\nsensor size. Therefore, it is beneficial to super-resolve a 360 image. Some\nattempts have been made but mostly considered the equirectangular projection\n(ERP) as one of the way for 360 image representation despite of\nlatitude-dependent distortions.In that case, as the output high-resolution(HR)\nimage is always in the same ERP format as the low-resolution (LR) input,\nanother information loss may occur when transforming the HR image to other\nprojection types.In this paper, we propose SphereSR, a novel framework to\ngenerate a continuous spherical image representation from an LR 360 image,\naiming at predicting the RGB values at given spherical coordinates for\nsuper-resolution with an arbitrary 360 image projection. Specifically, we first\npro-pose a feature extraction module that represents the spherical data based\non icosahedron and efficiently extracts features on the spherical surface. We\nthen propose a spherical local implicit image function (SLIIF) to predict RGB\nvalues at the spherical coordinates.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been used to tackle the few-shot learning\n(FSL) problem and shown great potentials under the transductive setting.\nHowever under the inductive setting, existing GNN based methods are less\ncompetitive. This is because they use an instance GNN as a label\npropagation/classification module, which is jointly meta-learned with a feature\nembedding network. This design is problematic because the classifier needs to\nadapt quickly to new tasks while the embedding does not. To overcome this\nproblem, in this paper we propose a novel hybrid GNN (HGNN) model consisting of\ntwo GNNs, an instance GNN and a prototype GNN. Instead of label propagation,\nthey act as feature embedding adaptation modules for quick adaptation of the\nmeta-learned feature embedding to new tasks. Importantly they are designed to\ndeal with a fundamental yet often neglected challenge in FSL, that is, with\nonly a handful of shots per class, any few-shot classifier would be sensitive\nto badly sampled shots which are either outliers or can cause inter-class\ndistribution overlapping. %Our two GNNs are designed to address these two types\nof poorly sampled few-shots respectively and their complementarity is exploited\nin the hybrid GNN model.

    "abstract": "Improving on the standard of care for diseases is predicated on better\ntreatments, which in turn relies on finding and developing new drugs. However,\ndrug discovery is a complex and costly process. Adoption of methods from\nmachine learning has given rise to creation of drug discovery knowledge graphs\nwhich utilize the inherent interconnected nature of the domain. Graph-based\ndata modelling, combined with knowledge graph embeddings provide a more\nintuitive representation of the domain and are suitable for inference tasks\nsuch as predicting missing links. One such example would be producing ranked\nlists of likely associated genes for a given disease, often referred to as\ntarget discovery. It is thus critical that these predictions are not only\npertinent but also biologically meaningful. However, knowledge graphs can be\nbiased either directly due to the underlying data sources that are integrated\nor due to modeling choices in the construction of the graph, one consequence of\nwhich is that certain entities can get topologically overrepresented. We show\nhow knowledge graph embedding models can be affected by this structural\nimbalance, resulting in densely connected entities being highly ranked no\nmatter the context. We provide support for this observation across different\ndatasets, models and predictive tasks. Further, we show how the graph topology\ncan be perturbed to artificially alter the rank of a gene via random,\nbiologically meaningless information. This suggests that such models can be\nmore influenced by the frequency of entities rather than biological information\nencoded in the relations, creating issues when entity frequency is not a true\nreflection of underlying data. Our results highlight the importance of data\nmodeling choices and emphasizes the need for practitioners to be mindful of\nthese issues when interpreting model outputs and during knowledge graph\ncomposition.",

    "abstract": "Decision-based attack poses a severe threat to real-world applications since\nit regards the target model as a black box and only accesses the hard\nprediction label. Great efforts have been made recently to decrease the number\nof queries; however, existing decision-based attacks still require thousands of\nqueries in order to generate good quality adversarial examples. In this work,\nwe find that a benign sample, the current and the next adversarial examples\ncould naturally construct a triangle in a subspace for any iterative attacks.\nBased on the law of sines, we propose a novel Triangle Attack (TA) to optimize\nthe perturbation by utilizing the geometric information that the longer side is\nalways opposite the larger angle in any triangle. However, directly applying\nsuch information on the input image is ineffective because it cannot thoroughly\nexplore the neighborhood of the input sample in the high dimensional space. To\naddress this issue, TA optimizes the perturbation in the low frequency space\nfor effective dimensionality reduction owing to the generality of such\ngeometric property. Extensive evaluations on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate\nthat TA achieves a much higher attack success rate within 1,000 queries and\nneeds a much less number of queries to achieve the same attack success rate\nunder various perturbation budgets than existing decision-based attacks. With\nsuch high efficiency, we further demonstrate the applicability of TA on\nreal-world API, i.e., Tencent Cloud API.",

However, due to complicated dependences on all the\nfeatures, it is challenging to interpret the resulting cluster assignments.\nMoshkovitz, Dasgupta, Rashtchian, and Frost [ICML 2020] proposed an elegant\nmodel of explainable $k$-means and $k$-median clustering. In this model, a\ndecision tree with $k$ leaves provides a straightforward characterization of\nthe data set into clusters.\nWe study two natural algorithmic questions about explainable clustering. (1)\nFor a given clustering, how to find the \"best explanation\" by using a decision\ntree with $k$ leaves? (2) For a given set of points, how to find a decision\ntree with $k$ leaves minimizing the $k$-means/median objective of the resulting\nexplainable clustering? To address the first question, we introduce a new model\nof explainable clustering. Our model, inspired by the notion of outliers in\nrobust statistics, is the following. We are seeking a small number of points\n(outliers) whose removal makes the existing clustering well-explainable. For\naddressing the second question, we initiate the study of the model of\nMoshkovitz et al. from the perspective of multivariate complexity. Our rigorous\nalgorithmic analysis sheds some light on the influence of parameters like the\ninput size, dimension of the data, the number of outliers, the number of\nclusters, and the approximation ratio, on the computational complexity of\nexplainable clustering.",

    "abstract": "The generalisation performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) is\ninfluenced by the quantity, quality, and variety of the training images.\nTraining images must be annotated, and this is time consuming and expensive.\nThe goal of our work was to reduce the number of annotated images needed to\ntrain a CNN while maintaining its performance. We hypothesised that the\nperformance of a CNN can be improved faster by ensuring that the set of\ntraining images contains a large fraction of hard-to-classify images. The\nobjective of our study was to test this hypothesis with an active learning\nmethod that can automatically select the hard-to-classify images. We developed\nan active learning method for Mask Region-based CNN (Mask R-CNN) and named this\nmethod MaskAL. MaskAL involved the iterative training of Mask R-CNN, after\nwhich the trained model was used to select a set of unlabelled images about\nwhich the model was uncertain. The selected images were then annotated and used\nto retrain Mask R-CNN, and this was repeated for a number of sampling\niterations. In our study, Mask R-CNN was trained on 2500 broccoli images that\nwere selected through 12 sampling iterations by either MaskAL or a random\nsampling method from a training set of 14,000 broccoli images. For all sampling\niterations, MaskAL performed significantly better than the random sampling.\nFurthermore, MaskAL had the same performance after sampling 900 images as the\nrandom sampling had after 2300 images. Compared to a Mask R-CNN model that was\ntrained on the entire training set (14,000 images), MaskAL achieved 93.9% of\nits performance with 17.9% of its training data. The random sampling achieved\n81.9% of its performance with 16.4% of its training data. We conclude that by\nusing MaskAL, the annotation effort can be reduced for training Mask R-CNN on a\nbroccoli dataset. Our software is available on\nhttps://github.com/pieterblok/maskal.",

The task of reconstructing these haplotypes from\nshort-read sequencing data is called viral quasispecies assembly, and it can be\ncategorized as a multiassembly problem. We consider the de novo version of the\nproblem, where no reference is available.\nWe present ViQUF, a de novo viral quasispecies assembler that addresses\nhaplotype assembly and quantification.

Face image quality assessment (FIQA)\nestimates the utility of the captured image in achieving reliable and accurate\nrecognition performance. In this work, we propose a novel learning paradigm\nthat learns internal network observations during the training process. Based on\nthat, our proposed CR-FIQA uses this paradigm to estimate the face image\nquality of a sample by predicting its relative classifiability. This\nclassifiability is measured based on the allocation of the training sample\nfeature representation in angular space with respect to its class center and\nthe nearest negative class center. We experimentally illustrate the correlation\nbetween the face image quality and the sample relative classifiability. As such\nproperty is only observable for the training dataset, we propose to learn this\nproperty from the training dataset and utilize it to predict the quality\nmeasure on unseen samples. This training is performed simultaneously while\noptimizing the class centers by an angular margin penalty-based softmax loss\nused for face recognition model training. Through extensive evaluation\nexperiments on eight benchmarks and four face recognition models, we\ndemonstrate the superiority of our proposed CR-FIQA over state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) FIQA algorithms.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies RIS-aided cell-free massive MIMO systems, where multiple\nRISs are deployed to assist the communication between multiple access points\n(APs) and multiple users, with either continuous or discrete phase shifts at\nthe RISs. We formulate the max-min fairness problem that maximizes the minimum\nachievable rate among all users by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming\nat active APs and the phase shifts at passive RISs, subject to power\nconstraints at the APs. To address such a challenging problem, we first study\nthe special single-user scenario and propose an algorithm that can transform\nthe optimization problem into semidefinite program (SDP) or integer linear\nprogram (ILP) for the cases of continuous and discrete phase shifts,\nrespectively. By solving the resulting SDP and ILP, we first obtain the optimal\nphase shifts, and then design the optimal transmit beamforming accordingly. To\nsolve the optimization problem for the multi-user scenario and continuous phase\nshifts at RISs, we extend the single-user algorithm and propose an alternating\noptimization algorithm, which can first decompose the max-min fairness problem\ninto two subproblems related to transmit beamforming and phase shifts, and then\ntransform the two subproblems into second-order-cone program and SDP,\nrespectively. For the multi-user scenario and discrete phase shifts, the\nmax-min fairness problem is shown to be a mixed-integer non-linear program\n(MINLP). To tackle it, we design a ZF-based successive refinement algorithm,\nwhich can find a suboptimal transmit beamforming and phase shifts by means of\nalternating optimization. Numerical results show that compared with benchmark\nschemes of random phase shifts and without using RISs, the proposed algorithms\ncan significantly increase the minimum achievable rate among all users,\nespecially when the number of reflecting elements at each RIS is large.",

The Bayesian analysis suggests four traits to be of particular interest\nin predicting need for cognition: openness to experience, conscientiousness,\nhonesty-humility, and emotionality. Further, we also find that need for\ncognition of software engineers is, on average, higher than in the general\npopulation, based on a comparison with prior studies.

    "title": "Quick Order Fairness",
    "abstract": "Leader-based protocols for consensus, i.e., atomic broadcast, allow some\nprocesses to unilaterally affect the final order of transactions. This has\nbecome a problem for blockchain networks and decentralized finance because it\nfacilitates front-running and other attacks. To address this, order fairness\nfor payload messages has been introduced recently as a new safety property for\natomic broadcast complementing traditional agreement and liveness. We relate\norder fairness to the standard validity notions for consensus protocols and\nhighlight some limitations with the existing formalization. Based on this, we\nintroduce a new differential order-fairness property that fixes these issues.\nWe also present the quick order-fair atomic broadcast protocol that guarantees\npayload message delivery in a differentially fair order and is much more\nefficient than existing order-fair consensus protocols. It works for\nasynchronous and for eventually synchronous networks with optimal resilience,\ntolerating corruptions of up to one third of the processes. Previous solutions\nrequired there to be less than one fourth of faults. Furthermore, our protocol\nincurs only quadratic cost, in terms of amortized message complexity per\ndelivered payload.",

    "abstract": "A global trend in increasing wind turbine size and distances from shore is\nemerging within the rapidly growing offshore wind farm market. In the UK, the\noffshore wind sector produced its highest amount of electricity in the UK in\n2019, a 19.6% increase on the year before. Currently, the UK is set to increase\nproduction further, targeting a 74.7% increase of installed turbine capacity as\nreflected in recent Crown Estate leasing rounds. With such tremendous growth,\nthe sector is now looking to Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (RAI) in\norder to tackle lifecycle service barriers as to support sustainable and\nprofitable offshore wind energy production. Today, RAI applications are\npredominately being used to support short term objectives in operation and\nmaintenance. However, moving forward, RAI has the potential to play a critical\nrole throughout the full lifecycle of offshore wind infrastructure, from\nsurveying, planning, design, logistics, operational support, training and\ndecommissioning. This paper presents one of the first systematic reviews of RAI\nfor the offshore renewable energy sector. The state-of-the-art in RAI is\nanalyzed with respect to offshore energy requirements, from both industry and\nacademia, in terms of current and future requirements. Our review also includes\na detailed evaluation of investment, regulation and skills development required\nto support the adoption of RAI. The key trends identified through a detailed\nanalysis of patent and academic publication databases provide insights to\nbarriers such as certification of autonomous platforms for safety compliance\nand reliability, the need for digital architectures for scalability in\nautonomous fleets, adaptive mission planning for resilient resident operations\nand optimization of human machine interaction for trusted partnerships between\npeople and autonomous assistants.",

Those\nworks assume the target domain data can be accessible all at once. However, for\nthe real-world streaming data, this hinders the timely adaptation to changing\ndata statistics and sufficient exploitation of increasing samples. In this\npaper, to address more practical scenarios, we propose a new task, Lifelong\nUnsupervised Domain Adaptive (LUDA) person ReID. This is challenging because it\nrequires the model to continuously adapt to unlabeled data of the target\nenvironments while alleviating catastrophic forgetting for such a fine-grained\nperson retrieval task. We design an effective scheme for this task, dubbed\nCLUDA-ReID, where the anti-forgetting is harmoniously coordinated with the\nadaptation. Specifically, a meta-based Coordinated Data Replay strategy is\nproposed to replay old data and update the network with a coordinated\noptimization direction for both adaptation and memorization. Moreover, we\npropose Relational Consistency Learning for old knowledge\ndistillation/inheritance in line with the objective of retrieval-based tasks.\nWe set up two evaluation settings to simulate the practical application\nscenarios.

    "title": "Tree-Based Dynamic Classifier Chains",
    "abstract": "Classifier chains are an effective technique for modeling label dependencies\nin multi-label classification. However, the method requires a fixed, static\norder of the labels. While in theory, any order is sufficient, in practice,\nthis order has a substantial impact on the quality of the final prediction.\nDynamic classifier chains denote the idea that for each instance to classify,\nthe order in which the labels are predicted is dynamically chosen. The\ncomplexity of a naive implementation of such an approach is prohibitive,\nbecause it would require to train a sequence of classifiers for every possible\npermutation of the labels. To tackle this problem efficiently, we propose a new\napproach based on random decision trees which can dynamically select the label\nordering for each prediction. We show empirically that a dynamic selection of\nthe next label improves over the use of a static ordering under an otherwise\nunchanged random decision tree model. % and experimental environment. In\naddition, we also demonstrate an alternative approach based on extreme gradient\nboosted trees, which allows for a more target-oriented training of dynamic\nclassifier chains. Our results show that this variant outperforms random\ndecision trees and other tree-based multi-label classification methods. More\nimportantly, the dynamic selection strategy allows to considerably speed up\ntraining and prediction.",

    "abstract": "Drones are not fully trusted yet. Their reliance on radios and cameras for\nnavigation raises safety and privacy concerns. These systems can fail, causing\naccidents, or be misused for unauthorized recordings. Considering recent\nregulations allowing commercial drones to operate only at night, we propose a\nradically new approach where drones obtain navigation information from\nartificial lighting. In our system, standard light bulbs modulate their\nintensity to send beacons and drones decode this information with a simple\nphotodiode. This optical information is combined with the inertial and altitude\nsensors in the drones to provide localization without the need for radios, GPS\nor cameras. Our framework is the first to provide 3D drone localization with\nlight and we evaluate it with a testbed consisting of four light beacons and a\nmini-drone. We show that, our approach allows to locate the drone within a few\ndecimeters of the actual position and compared to state-of-the-art positioning\nmethods, reduces the localization error by 42%.",

    "title": "Bi-directional Beamforming Feedback-based Firmware-agnostic WiFi Sensing",
    "abstract": "In the field of WiFi sensing, as an alternative sensing source of the channel\nstate information (CSI) matrix, the use of a beamforming feedback matrix\n(BFM)that is a right singular matrix of the CSI matrix has attracted\nsignificant interest owing to its wide availability regarding the underlying\nWiFi systems. In the IEEE 802.11ac/ax standard, the station (STA) transmits a\nBFM to an access point (AP), which uses the BFM for precoded multiple-input and\nmultiple-output communications. In addition, in the same way, the AP transmits\na BFM to the STA, and the STA uses the received BFM. Regarding BFM-based\nsensing, extensive real-world experiments were conducted as part of this study,\nand two key insights were reported: Firstly, this report identified a potential\nissue related to accuracy in existing uni-directional BFM-based sensing\nframeworks that leverage only BFMs transmitted for the AP or STA. Such\nuni-directionality introduces accuracy concerns when there is a sensing\ncapability gap between the uni-directional BFMs for the AP and STA. Thus, this\nreport experimentally evaluates the sensing ability disparity between the\nuni-directional BFMs, and shows that the BFMs transmitted for an AP achieve\nhigher sensing accuracy compared to the BFMs transmitted from the STA when the\nsensing target values are estimated depending on the angle of departure of the\nAP. Secondly, to complement the sensing gap, this paper proposes a\nbi-directional sensing framework, which simultaneously leverages the BFMs\ntransmitted from the AP and STA. The experimental evaluations reveal that\nbi-directional sensing achieves higher accuracy than uni-directional sensing in\nterms of the human localization task.",

    "title": "Anchor Retouching via Model Interaction for Robust Object Detection in  Aerial Images",
    "abstract": "Object detection has made tremendous strides in computer vision. Small object\ndetection with appearance degradation is a prominent challenge, especially for\naerial observations. To collect sufficient positive/negative samples for\nheuristic training, most object detectors preset region anchors in order to\ncalculate Intersection-over-Union (IoU) against the ground-truthed data. In\nthis case, small objects are frequently abandoned or mislabeled. In this paper,\nwe present an effective Dynamic Enhancement Anchor (DEA) network to construct a\nnovel training sample generator. Different from the other state-of-the-art\ntechniques, the proposed network leverages a sample discriminator to realize\ninteractive sample screening between an anchor-based unit and an anchor-free\nunit to generate eligible samples. Besides, multi-task joint training with a\nconservative anchor-based inference scheme enhances the performance of the\nproposed model while reducing computational complexity. The proposed scheme\nsupports both oriented and horizontal object detection tasks. Extensive\nexperiments on two challenging aerial benchmarks (i.e., DOTA and HRSC2016)\nindicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy with\nmoderate inference speed and computational overhead for training. On DOTA, our\nDEA-Net which integrated with the baseline of RoI-Transformer surpasses the\nadvanced method by 0.40% mean-Average-Precision (mAP) for oriented object\ndetection with a weaker backbone network (ResNet-101 vs ResNet-152) and 3.08%\nmean-Average-Precision (mAP) for horizontal object detection with the same\nbackbone. Besides, our DEA-Net which integrated with the baseline of ReDet\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance by 80.37%. On HRSC2016, it surpasses\nthe previous best model by 1.1% using only 3 horizontal anchors.",

    "abstract": "The existence of native code in Android apps plays an essential role in\ntriggering inconspicuous propagation of secrets and circumventing malware\ndetection. However, the state-of-the-art information-flow analysis tools for\nAndroid apps all have limited capabilities of analyzing native code. Due to the\ncomplexity of binary-level static analysis, most static analyzers choose to\nbuild conservative models for a selected portion of native code. Though the\nrecent inter-language analysis improves the capability of tracking information\nflow in native code, it is still far from attaining similar effectiveness of\nthe state-of-the-art information-flow analyzers that focus on non-native Java\nmethods. To overcome the above constraints, we propose a new analysis\nframework, i.e., \\sysname{}, to detect sensitive information flows of the\nAndroid apps containing native code. In this framework, we combine a\ncontrol-flow-based static binary analysis with a mutation-based dynamic\nanalysis to model the tainting behaviors of native code in the apps. Based on\nthe result of the analyses, \\sysname{} conducts a stub generation for the\nrelated native functions to facilitate the state-of-the-art analyzer, i.e.,\nDroidSafe, with fine-grained tainting behavior summaries of native code. The\nexperimental results show that our framework is competitive on the accuracy and\neffective in analyzing the information flows in real-world apps and malware\ncompared with the state-of-the-art inter-language static analysis.",

It will be approached by identifying keywords with linguistic\npatterns from the text, and the geographical coordinates associated with the\npublication. Context-specific innovations are introduced to deal with data\nacross South America and, in particular, in the city of Arequipa, Peru. The\nobjective is to identify the five main land uses: residential, commercial,\ninstitutional-governmental, industrial-offices and unbuilt land. Within the\nframework of urban planning and sustainable urban management, the methodology\ncontributes to the optimization of the identification techniques applied for\nthe updating of land use cadastres, since the results achieved an accuracy of\nabout 90%, which motivates its application in the real context. In addition, it\nwould allow the identification of land use categories at a more detailed level,\nin situations such as a complex/mixed distribution building based on the amount\nof data collected.

To address these issues, we\nintroduce Neural-Shape from Caustics (N-SfC), a learning-based extension that\nincorporates two components into the reconstruction pipeline: a denoising\nmodule, which alleviates the computational cost of the light transport\nsimulation, and an optimization process based on learned gradient descent,\nwhich enables better convergence using fewer iterations.

Our recently proposed learning strategy based on masking, Phone Masking\nTraining (PMT), alleviates the impact of such phenomenon in Uyghur ASR.\nAlthough PMT achieves remarkably improvements, there still exists room for\nfurther gains due to the granularity mismatch between masking unit of PMT\n(phoneme) and modeling unit (word-piece). To boost the performance of PMT, we\npropose multi-modeling unit training (MMUT) architecture fusion with PMT\n(PM-MMUT). The idea of MMUT framework is to split the Encoder into two parts\nincluding acoustic feature sequences to phoneme-level representation\n(AF-to-PLR) and phoneme-level representation to word-piece-level representation\n(PLR-to-WPLR). It allows AF-to-PLR to be optimized by an intermediate\nphoneme-based CTC loss to learn the rich phoneme-level context information\nbrought by PMT.

    "abstract": "Exemplar-based generative models for open-domain conversation produce\nresponses based on the exemplars provided by the retriever, taking advantage of\ngenerative models and retrieval models. However, they often ignore the\nretrieved exemplars while generating responses or produce responses over-fitted\nto the retrieved exemplars. In this paper, we argue that these drawbacks are\nderived from the one-to-many problem of the open-domain conversation. When the\nretrieved exemplar is relevant to the given context yet significantly different\nfrom the gold response, the exemplar-based generative models are trained to\nignore the exemplar since the exemplar is not helpful for generating the gold\nresponse. On the other hand, when the retrieved exemplar is lexically similar\nto the gold response, the generative models are trained to rely on the exemplar\nhighly. Therefore, we propose a training method selecting exemplars that are\nsemantically relevant to the gold response but lexically distanced from the\ngold response to mitigate the above disadvantages. In the training phase, our\nproposed training method first uses the gold response instead of dialogue\ncontext as a query to select exemplars that are semantically relevant to the\ngold response. And then, it eliminates the exemplars that lexically resemble\nthe gold responses to alleviate the dependency of the generative models on that\nexemplars. The remaining exemplars could be irrelevant to the given context\nsince they are searched depending on the gold response. Thus, our proposed\ntraining method further utilizes the relevance scores between the given context\nand the exemplars to penalize the irrelevant exemplars. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our proposed training method alleviates the drawbacks of the\nexisting exemplar-based generative models and significantly improves the\nperformance in terms of appropriateness and informativeness.",

They are studied in bioacoustics and ecoacoustics, with signal\nprocessing and analysis an important component. Computational bioacoustics has\naccelerated in recent decades due to the growth of affordable digital sound\nrecording devices, and to huge progress in informatics such as big data, signal\nprocessing and machine learning. Methods are inherited from the wider field of\ndeep learning, including speech and image processing. However, the tasks,\ndemands and data characteristics are often different from those addressed in\nspeech or music analysis. There remain unsolved problems, and tasks for which\nevidence is surely present in many acoustic signals, but not yet realised. In\nthis paper I perform a review of the state of the art in deep learning for\ncomputational bioacoustics, aiming to clarify key concepts and identify and\nanalyse knowledge gaps. Based on this, I offer a subjective but principled\nroadmap for computational bioacoustics with deep learning: topics that the\ncommunity should aim to address, in order to make the most of future\ndevelopments in AI and informatics, and to use audio data in answering\nzoological and ecological questions.",

    "abstract": "Multi-armed bandits (MAB) are extensively studied in various settings where\nthe objective is to \\textit{maximize} the actions' outcomes (i.e., rewards)\nover time. Since safety is crucial in many real-world problems, safe versions\nof MAB algorithms have also garnered considerable interest. In this work, we\ntackle a different critical task through the lens of \\textit{linear stochastic\nbandits}, where the aim is to keep the actions' outcomes close to a target\nlevel while respecting a \\textit{two-sided} safety constraint, which we call\n\\textit{leveling}. Such a task is prevalent in numerous domains. Many\nhealthcare problems, for instance, require keeping a physiological variable in\na range and preferably close to a target level. The radical change in our\nobjective necessitates a new acquisition strategy, which is at the heart of a\nMAB algorithm. We propose SALE-LTS: Safe Leveling via Linear Thompson Sampling\nalgorithm, with a novel acquisition strategy to accommodate our task and show\nthat it achieves sublinear regret with the same time and dimension dependence\nas previous works on the classical reward maximization problem absent any\nsafety constraint. We demonstrate and discuss our algorithm's empirical\nperformance in detail via thorough experiments.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art contextualized models such as BERT use tasks such as WiC and\nWSD to evaluate their word-in-context representations. This inherently assumes\nthat performance in these tasks reflect how well a model represents the coupled\nword and context semantics. This study investigates this assumption by\npresenting the first quantitative analysis (using probing baselines) on the\ncontext-word interaction being tested in major contextual lexical semantic\ntasks. Specifically, based on the probing baseline performance, we propose\nmeasures to calculate the degree of context or word biases in a dataset, and\nplot existing datasets on a continuum. The analysis shows most existing\ndatasets fall into the extreme ends of the continuum (i.e. they are either\nheavily context-biased or target-word-biased) while only AM$^2$iCo and Sense\nRetrieval challenge a model to represent both the context and target words. Our\ncase study on WiC reveals that human subjects do not share models' strong\ncontext biases in the dataset (humans found semantic judgments much more\ndifficult when the target word is missing) and models are learning spurious\ncorrelations from context alone. This study demonstrates that models are\nusually not being tested for word-in-context representations as such in these\ntasks and results are therefore open to misinterpretation. We recommend our\nframework as sanity check for context and target word biases of future task\ndesign and application in lexical semantics.",

Most existing machine learning models typically rely on massive\namounts of labeled training data to achieve high performance. Unfortunately,\nsuch a requirement cannot be met in real-world applications. The number of\nlabels is limited and manually annotating data is expensive and time-consuming.\nIt is often necessary to transfer knowledge from an existing labeled domain to\na new domain. However, model performance degrades because of the differences\nbetween domains (domain shift or dataset bias). To overcome the burden of\nannotation, Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to mitigate the domain shift problem\nwhen transferring knowledge from one domain into another similar but different\ndomain. Unsupervised DA (UDA) deals with a labeled source domain and an\nunlabeled target domain. The principal objective of UDA is to reduce the domain\ndiscrepancy between the labeled source data and unlabeled target data and to\nlearn domain-invariant representations across the two domains during training.\nIn this paper, we first define UDA problem. Secondly, we overview the\nstate-of-the-art methods for different categories of UDA from both traditional\nmethods and deep learning based methods.

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown the potential benefit of selective prediction systems\nthat can learn to defer to a human when the predictions of the AI are\nunreliable, particularly to improve the reliability of AI systems in\nhigh-stakes applications like healthcare or conservation. However, most prior\nwork assumes that human behavior remains unchanged when they solve a prediction\ntask as part of a human-AI team as opposed to by themselves. We show that this\nis not the case by performing experiments to quantify human-AI interaction in\nthe context of selective prediction. In particular, we study the impact of\ncommunicating different types of information to humans about the AI system's\ndecision to defer. Using real-world conservation data and a selective\nprediction system that improves expected accuracy over that of the human or AI\nsystem working individually, we show that this messaging has a significant\nimpact on the accuracy of human judgements. Our results study two components of\nthe messaging strategy: 1) Whether humans are informed about the prediction of\nthe AI system and 2) Whether they are informed about the decision of the\nselective prediction system to defer. By manipulating these messaging\ncomponents, we show that it is possible to significantly boost human\nperformance by informing the human of the decision to defer, but not revealing\nthe prediction of the AI. We therefore show that it is vital to consider how\nthe decision to defer is communicated to a human when designing selective\nprediction systems, and that the composite accuracy of a human-AI team must be\ncarefully evaluated using a human-in-the-loop framework.",

The properties of\nthese sensors allow for accurate and fast calculation of optical flow as events\nare generated. Existing solutions for calculating optical flow from event data\neither fail to capture the true direction of motion due to the aperture\nproblem, do not use the high temporal resolution of the sensor, or are too\ncomputationally expensive to be run in real time on embedded platforms. In this\nresearch, we first present a faster version of our previous algorithm, ARMS\n(Aperture Robust Multi-Scale flow). The new optimized software version (fARMS)\nsignificantly improves throughput on a traditional CPU. Further, we present\nhARMS, a hardware realization of the fARMS algorithm allowing for real-time\ncomputation of true flow on low-power, embedded platforms. The proposed hARMS\narchitecture targets hybrid system-on-chip devices and was designed to maximize\nconfigurability and throughput. The hardware architecture and fARMS algorithm\nwere developed with asynchronous neuromorphic processing in mind, abandoning\nthe common use of an event frame and instead operating using only a small\nhistory of relevant events, allowing latency to scale independently of the\nsensor resolution. This change in processing paradigm improved the estimation\nof flow directions by up to 73% compared to the existing method and yielded a\ndemonstrated hARMS throughput of up to 1.21 Mevent/s on the benchmark\nconfiguration selected.

    "abstract": "Depth estimation is a challenging task of 3D reconstruction to enhance the\naccuracy sensing of environment awareness. This work brings a new solution with\na set of improvements, which increase the quantitative and qualitative\nunderstanding of depth maps compared to existing methods. Recently, a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) has demonstrated its extraordinary ability\nin estimating depth maps from monocular videos. However, traditional CNN does\nnot support topological structure and they can work only on regular image\nregions with determined size and weights. On the other hand, graph\nconvolutional networks (GCN) can handle the convolution on non-Euclidean data\nand it can be applied to irregular image regions within a topological\nstructure. Therefore, in this work in order to preserve object geometric\nappearances and distributions, we aim at exploiting GCN for a self-supervised\ndepth estimation model. Our model consists of two parallel auto-encoder\nnetworks: the first is an auto-encoder that will depend on ResNet-50 and\nextract the feature from the input image and on multi-scale GCN to estimate the\ndepth map. In turn, the second network will be used to estimate the ego-motion\nvector (i.e., 3D pose) between two consecutive frames based on ResNet-18. Both\nthe estimated 3D pose and depth map will be used for constructing a target\nimage. A combination of loss functions related to photometric, projection, and\nsmoothness is used to cope with bad depth prediction and preserve the\ndiscontinuities of the objects. In particular, our method provided comparable\nand promising results with a high prediction accuracy of 89% on the publicly\nKITTI and Make3D datasets along with a reduction of 40% in the number of\ntrainable parameters compared to the state of the art solutions.

When a new vulnerability is\ndiscovered in a package, the package should quickly release a fix in a new\nversion, referred to as security release in this study. The security release\nshould be well-documented and require minimal migration effort to facilitate\nfast adoption by the client projects. However, to what extent the open source\npackages follow these recommendations is not known. The goal of this study is\nto aid software practitioners and researchers in understanding the current\npractice of releasing security fixes by open source packages and identifying\nareas for improvement through an empirical study of security releases.\nSpecifically, in this paper, we study (1) the time lag between fix and release;\n(2) how security fixes are documented in the release notes; (3) code change\ncharacteristics (size and semantic versioning) of the release; and (4) the time\nlag between the release and an advisory publication on Snyk or NVD (two popular\nvulnerability databases) for security releases over a dataset of 4,377 security\nadvisories across seven package ecosystems. We find that the median security\nrelease is available in under 4 days of the corresponding fix and contains 134\nlines of code (LOC) change. Further, we find that 61.5% of the security\nreleases come with a release note that documents the corresponding security\nfix. However, Snyk and NVD may take a median of 25 days (from the release) to\npublish an advisory for these security releases, possibly resulting in delayed\nnotification to the client projects.

    "abstract": "Simplicial neural networks (SNN) have recently emerged as the newest\ndirection in graph learning which expands the idea of convolutional\narchitectures from node space to simplicial complexes on graphs. Instead of\npre-dominantly assessing pairwise relations among nodes as in the current\npractice, simplicial complexes allow us to describe higher-order interactions\nand multi-node graph structures. By building upon connection between the\nconvolution operation and the new block Hodge-Laplacian, we propose the first\nSNN for link prediction. Our new Block Simplicial Complex Neural Networks\n(BScNets) model generalizes the existing graph convolutional network (GCN)\nframeworks by systematically incorporating salient interactions among multiple\nhigher-order graph structures of different dimensions. We discuss theoretical\nfoundations behind BScNets and illustrate its utility for link prediction on\neight real-world and synthetic datasets. Our experiments indicate that BScNets\noutperforms the state-of-the-art models by a significant margin while\nmaintaining low computation costs. Finally, we show utility of BScNets as the\nnew promising alternative for tracking spread of infectious diseases such as\nCOVID-19 and measuring the effectiveness of the healthcare risk mitigation\nstrategies.",

However, stabilized formulations for\nlogarithmic conformation reformulations in the context of finite element\nmethods have not yet been widely studied. We present stabilized formulations\nfor the logarithmic reformulation of the Oldroyd-B model by Saramito (2014)\nbased on the Variational Multiscale framework and Galerkin/Least-Squares\nmethod. The reformulation allows the use of Newton's method due to its\nfully-implicit nature for solving the steady-state problem directly. The\nproposed stabilization methods cure instabilities of convection and\ncompatibility while preserving a three-field problem. The spatial accuracy of\nthe formulations is assessed with the four-roll periodic box, revealing\ncomparable accuracy between the methods. The formulations are validated with\nbenchmark flows past a cylinder and through a 4:1 contraction. We found an\nexcellent agreement to benchmark results in the literature.

We use a\ndifferentiable relaxation to approximately search through the combinatorial\nspace. An $L_0$ regularization term ensures that the search converges to\ndiscrete and sparse solutions. We apply our method to analyze subject-verb\nnumber agreement and gender bias detection in LSTMs. We observe that it is fast\nand finds better solutions than the alternative (REINFORCE).

In contrast to problems\nposed in finite domains, simple moments of the distribution, such as the mean\n(MFPT) and variance, are not defined and it is necessary to obtain the full\narrival statistics. We describe several methods to obtain these distributions\nand other associated quantities such as splitting probabilities. One approach\ncombines a Laplace transform of the underlying parabolic equation with matched\nasymptotic analysis followed by numerical transform inversion. The second\napproach is similar, but uses a boundary integral equation method to solve for\nthe Laplace transformed variable. To validate the results of this theory, and\nto obtain the arrival time statistics in very general configurations of\nabsorbers, we introduce an efficient Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method that\ndescribes trajectories as a combination of large but exactly solvable\nprojection steps. The effectiveness of these methodologies is demonstrated on a\nvariety of challenging examples highlighting the applicability of these methods\nto a variety of practical scenarios, such as source inference. A particularly\nuseful finding arising from these results is that homogenization theories, in\nwhich complex configurations are replaced by equivalent simple ones, are\nremarkably effective at describing arrival time statistics.",

    "abstract": "Peer-to-peer energy management systems for smart grids require developers to\nconsider the trade-offs between the amount of communication traffic generated\nand the quality and speed of convergence of the control algorithms that are\ndeployed. Employing a fully connected communication causes messages to scale\nexponentially with the number of nodes, while using a sparse connectivity\ncauses less information dissemination leading to degradation of the algorithm\nperformance. The best communication topology for a particular application lies\nsomewhere in between and often requires empirical evaluation by application\ndesigners. Existing methods do not put focus on the needs for smart grid\napplications, which is information dissemination throughout the network and\nthey do not provide a flexible solution for application developers to prototype\nand deploy different topologies without modifying the application code. This\npaper introduces a configurable virtual communication topology framework\nTopLinkMgr, allowing users to specify any chosen communication topology and\ndeploy peer-to-peer applications using it. It also introduces a self-adaptive,\nfault-tolerant topology management algorithm, Bounded Path Dissemination that\ncan ensure the dissemination of information to all peers within a specified\nthreshold for a sparsely connected topology. Experiments show that the\nalgorithm improves on convergence speed and accuracy over state-of-the-art\nmethods and is also robust against node failures.

This\nsystem can ingest 15,000 patient records per hour, where each record represents\nthousands of multimodal measurements, text notes, and high resolution data.\nCollectively, these records can approach a terabyte of data. The system can\nfurther perform cohort generation and preliminary dataset analysis in 2-5\nminutes. As a result, multiple users can collaborate simultaneously to iterate\non datasets and models in real time. We anticipate that this approach will\ndrive real-world AI model development, and, in the long run, meaningfully\nimprove healthcare delivery.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a rapid rise of artificial neural networks being\nemployed in a number of cognitive tasks. The ever-increasing computing\nrequirements of these structures have contributed to a desire for novel\ntechnologies and paradigms, including memristor-based hardware accelerators.\nSolutions based on memristive crossbars and analog data processing promise to\nimprove the overall energy efficiency. However, memristor nonidealities can\nlead to the degradation of neural network accuracy, while the attempts to\nmitigate these negative effects often introduce design trade-offs, such as\nthose between power and reliability. In this work, we design nonideality-aware\ntraining of memristor-based neural networks capable of dealing with the most\ncommon device nonidealities. We demonstrate the feasibility of using\nhigh-resistance devices that exhibit high $I$-$V$ nonlinearity -- by analyzing\nexperimental data and employing nonideality-aware training, we estimate that\nthe energy efficiency of memristive vector-matrix multipliers is improved by\nthree orders of magnitude ($555\\ \\mathrm{GOPs}^{-1}\\mathrm{W}^{-1}$ to $474\\\n\\mathrm{TOPs}^{-1}\\mathrm{W}^{-1}$) while maintaining similar accuracy. We show\nthat associating the parameters of neural networks with individual memristors\nallows to bias these devices towards less conductive states through\nregularization of the corresponding optimization problem, while modifying the\nvalidation procedure leads to more reliable estimates of performance. We\ndemonstrate the universality and robustness of our approach when dealing with a\nwide range of nonidealities.",

A region is associated with the majority party in that region, and a\npoint is unhappy in $\\Pi$ if it belongs to the minority party. A group $D$ of\nroughly $\\sigma$ contiguous points is called a deviating group with respect to\n$\\Pi$ if majority of points in $D$ are unhappy in $\\Pi$. The partition $\\Pi$ is\nlocally fair if there is no deviating group with respect to $\\Pi$.\nThis paper focuses on a restricted case when points lie in $1$D. The problem\nis non-trivial even in this case. We consider both adversarial and ''beyond\nworst-case\" settings for this problem. For the former, we characterize the\ninput parameters for which a locally fair partition always exists; we also show\nthat a locally fair partition may not exist for certain parameters. We then\nconsider input models where there are ''runs'' of red and blue points. For such\nclustered inputs, we show that a locally fair partition may not exist for\ncertain values of $\\sigma$, but an approximate locally fair partition exists if\nwe allow some regions to have smaller sizes.

Moreover, to further boost the convergence of the\nglobally shared encoder when a domain shift is present, a weighted contrastive\nregularization is introduced to directly correct any deviation between the\nclient and server during optimization.

    "abstract": "In clinical medicine, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most\nimportant tools for diagnosis, triage, prognosis, and treatment planning.\nHowever, MRI suffers from an inherent slow data acquisition process because\ndata is collected sequentially in k-space. In recent years, most MRI\nreconstruction methods proposed in the literature focus on holistic image\nreconstruction rather than enhancing the edge information. This work steps\naside this general trend by elaborating on the enhancement of edge information.\nSpecifically, we introduce a novel parallel imaging coupled dual discriminator\ngenerative adversarial network (PIDD-GAN) for fast multi-channel MRI\nreconstruction by incorporating multi-view information. The dual discriminator\ndesign aims to improve the edge information in MRI reconstruction. One\ndiscriminator is used for holistic image reconstruction, whereas the other one\nis responsible for enhancing edge information. An improved U-Net with local and\nglobal residual learning is proposed for the generator. Frequency channel\nattention blocks (FCA Blocks) are embedded in the generator for incorporating\nattention mechanisms. Content loss is introduced to train the generator for\nbetter reconstruction quality. We performed comprehensive experiments on\nCalgary-Campinas public brain MR dataset and compared our method with\nstate-of-the-art MRI reconstruction methods. Ablation studies of residual\nlearning were conducted on the MICCAI13 dataset to validate the proposed\nmodules. Results show that our PIDD-GAN provides high-quality reconstructed MR\nimages, with well-preserved edge information. The time of single-image\nreconstruction is below 5ms, which meets the demand of faster processing.",

We bring forward a number of considerations, such as view generation for\nthe contrastive objective and hyper-parameter tuning. In a large battery of\nexperiments, we analyze how the downstream performance in tissue classification\nwill be affected by these considerations. The results point to how contrastive\nlearning can reduce the annotation effort within digital pathology, but that\nthe specific dataset characteristics need to be considered. To take full\nadvantage of the contrastive learning objective, different calibrations of view\ngeneration and hyper-parameters are required. Our results pave the way for\nrealizing the full potential of self-supervised learning for histopathology\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing has promised significant improvement in solving difficult\ncomputational tasks over classical computers. Designing quantum circuits for\npractical use, however, is not a trivial objective and requires expert-level\nknowledge. To aid this endeavor, this paper proposes a machine learning-based\nmethod to construct quantum circuit architectures. Previous works have\ndemonstrated that classical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms can\nsuccessfully construct quantum circuit architectures without encoded physics\nknowledge. However, these DRL-based works are not generalizable to settings\nwith changing device noises, thus requiring considerable amounts of training\nresources to keep the RL models up-to-date. With this in mind, we incorporated\ncontinual learning to enhance the performance of our algorithm. In this paper,\nwe present the Probabilistic Policy Reuse with deep Q-learning (PPR-DQL)\nframework to tackle this circuit design challenge. By conducting numerical\nsimulations over various noise patterns, we demonstrate that the RL agent with\nPPR was able to find the quantum gate sequence to generate the two-qubit Bell\nstate faster than the agent that was trained from scratch. The proposed\nframework is general and can be applied to other quantum gate synthesis or\ncontrol problems -- including the automatic calibration of quantum devices.",

    "abstract": "Thousands of scanned historical topographic maps contain valuable information\ncovering long periods of time, such as how the hydrography of a region has\nchanged over time. Efficiently unlocking the information in these maps requires\ntraining a geospatial objects recognition system, which needs a large amount of\nannotated data. Overlapping geo-referenced external vector data with\ntopographic maps according to their coordinates can annotate the desired\nobjects' locations in the maps automatically. However, directly overlapping the\ntwo datasets causes misaligned and false annotations because the publication\nyears and coordinate projection systems of topographic maps are different from\nthe external vector data. We propose a label correction algorithm, which\nleverages the color information of maps and the prior shape information of the\nexternal vector data to reduce misaligned and false annotations. The\nexperiments show that the precision of annotations from the proposed algorithm\nis 10% higher than the annotations from a state-of-the-art algorithm.\nConsequently, recognition results using the proposed algorithm's annotations\nachieve 9% higher correctness than using the annotations from the\nstate-of-the-art algorithm.",

    "abstract": "In two-alternative forced choice tasks, prior knowledge can improve\nperformance, especially when operating near the psychophysical threshold. For\ninstance, if subjects know that one choice is much more likely than the other,\nthey can make that choice when evidence is weak. A common hypothesis for these\nkinds of tasks is that the prior is stored in neural activity. Here we propose\na different hypothesis: the prior is stored in synaptic strengths. We study the\nInternational Brain Laboratory task, in which a grating appears on either the\nright or left side of a screen, and a mouse has to move a wheel to bring the\ngrating to the center. The grating is often low in contrast which makes the\ntask relatively difficult, and the prior probability that the grating appears\non the right is either 80% or 20%, in (unsignaled) blocks of about 50 trials.\nWe model this as a reinforcement learning task, using a feedforward neural\nnetwork to map states to actions, and adjust the weights of the network to\nmaximize reward, learning via policy gradient. Our model uses an internal state\nthat stores an estimate of the grating and confidence, and follows Bayesian\nupdates, and can switch between engaged and disengaged states to mimic animal\nbehavior. This model reproduces the main experimental finding - that the\npsychometric curve with respect to contrast shifts after a block switch in\nabout 10 trials. Also, as seen in the experiments, in our model the difference\nin neuronal activity in the right and left blocks is small - it is virtually\nimpossible to decode block structure from activity on single trials if noise is\nabout 2%. The hypothesis that priors are stored in weights is difficult to\ntest, but the technology to do so should be available in the not so distant\nfuture.",

    "abstract": "Individuals who interact with each other in social networks often exchange\nideas and influence each other's opinions. A popular approach to studying the\ndynamics of opinion spread on networks is by examining bounded-confidence (BC)\nmodels, in which the nodes of a network have continuous-valued states that\nencode their opinions and are receptive to other opinions if they lie within\nsome confidence bound of their own opinion. We extend the Deffuant--Weisbuch\n(DW) model, which is a well-known BC model, by studying opinion dynamics that\ncoevolve with network structure. We propose an adaptive variant of the DW model\nin which the nodes of a network can (1) alter their opinion when they interact\nwith a neighboring node and (2) break a connection with a neighbor based on an\nopinion tolerance threshold and then form a new connection to a node following\nthe principle of homophily. This opinion tolerance threshold acts as a\nthreshold to determine if the opinions of adjacent nodes are sufficiently\ndifferent to be viewed as discordant. We find that our adaptive BC model\nrequires a larger confidence bound than the standard DW model for the nodes of\na network to achieve a consensus. Interestingly, our model includes regions\nwith `pseudo-consensus' steady states, in which there exist two subclusters\nwithin an opinion-consensus group that deviate from each other by a small\namount. We conduct extensive numerical simulations of our adaptive BC model and\nexamine the importance of early-time dynamics and nodes with initial moderate\nopinions for achieving consensus. We also examine the effects of coevolution on\nthe convergence time of the dynamics.",

For lung segmentation, the median values of dice similarity\ncoefficient, Jaccard index and average surface distance, were 98.56%, 97.15%\nand 0.49 mm, respectively.

One of the main open challenges is how to directly generate a desirable\nqudit state in the SPDC process. This problem can be addressed through advanced\ncomputational learning methods; however, due to difficulties in modeling the\nSPDC process by a fully differentiable algorithm that takes into account all\ninteraction effects, progress has been limited. Here, we overcome these\nlimitations and introduce a physically-constrained and differentiable model,\nvalidated against experimental results for shaped pump beams and structured\ncrystals, capable of learning every interaction parameter in the process. We\navoid any restrictions induced by the stochastic nature of our physical model\nand integrate the dynamic equations governing the evolution under the SPDC\nHamiltonian. We solve the inverse problem of designing a nonlinear quantum\noptical system that achieves the desired quantum state of down-converted photon\npairs. The desired states are defined using either the second-order\ncorrelations between different spatial modes or by specifying the required\ndensity matrix. By learning nonlinear volume holograms as well as different\npump shapes, we successfully show how to generate maximally entangled states.\nFurthermore, we simulate all-optical coherent control over the generated\nquantum state by actively changing the profile of the pump beam.

    "abstract": "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a cornerstone of machine learning. When\nthe number N of data items is large, SGD relies on constructing an unbiased\nestimator of the gradient of the empirical risk using a small subset of the\noriginal dataset, called a minibatch. Default minibatch construction involves\nuniformly sampling a subset of the desired size, but alternatives have been\nexplored for variance reduction. In particular, experimental evidence suggests\ndrawing minibatches from determinantal point processes (DPPs), distributions\nover minibatches that favour diversity among selected items. However, like in\nrecent work on DPPs for coresets, providing a systematic and principled\nunderstanding of how and why DPPs help has been difficult. In this work, we\ncontribute an orthogonal polynomial-based DPP paradigm for minibatch sampling\nin SGD. Our approach leverages the specific data distribution at hand, which\nendows it with greater sensitivity and power over existing data-agnostic\nmethods. We substantiate our method via a detailed theoretical analysis of its\nconvergence properties, interweaving between the discrete data set and the\nunderlying continuous domain. In particular, we show how specific DPPs and a\nstring of controlled approximations can lead to gradient estimators with a\nvariance that decays faster with the batchsize than under uniform sampling.\nCoupled with existing finite-time guarantees for SGD on convex objectives, this\nentails that, DPP minibatches lead to a smaller bound on the mean square\napproximation error than uniform minibatches. Moreover, our estimators are\namenable to a recent algorithm that directly samples linear statistics of DPPs\n(i.e., the gradient estimator) without sampling the underlying DPP (i.e., the\nminibatch), thereby reducing computational overhead.

    "abstract": "The interpretation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) gives clinical information\nand helps in the assessing of the heart function. There are distinct ECG\npatterns associated with a specific class of arrythmia. The convolutional\nneural network is actually one of the most applied deep learning algorithms in\nECG processing. However, with deep learning models there are many more\nhyperparameters to tune. Selecting an optimum or best hyperparameter for the\nconvolutional neural network algorithm is challenging. Often, we end up tuning\nthe model manually with different possible range of values until a best fit\nmodel is obtained. Automatic hyperparameters tuning using Bayesian optimization\n(BO) and evolutionary algorithms brings a solution to the harbor manual\nconfiguration. In this paper, we propose to optimize the Recurrent one\nDimensional Convolutional Neural Network model (R-1D-CNN) with two levels. At\nthe first level, a residual convolutional layer and one-dimensional\nconvolutional neural layers are trained to learn patient-specific ECG features\nover which the multilayer perceptron layers can learn to produce the final\nclass vectors of each input. This level is manual and aims to lower the search\nspace. The second level is automatic and based on proposed algorithm based BO.\nOur proposed optimized R-1D-CNN architecture is evaluated on two publicly\navailable ECG Datasets. The experimental results display that the proposed\nalgorithm based BO achieves an optimum rate of 99.95\\%, while the baseline\nmodel achieves 99.70\\% for the MIT-BIH database. Moreover, experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed architecture fine-tuned with BO achieves a higher\naccuracy than the other proposed architectures. Our architecture achieves a\ngood result compared to previous works and based on different experiments.",

For (ordinary) signatures, we focus on the arguably\npreferable security notion of blind-unforgeability recently proposed by Alagic\net al. (Eurocrypt'20). We present two short signature schemes achieving this\nnotion: one is in the quantum random oracle model, assuming quantum hardness of\nSIS; and the other is in the plain model, assuming quantum hardness of LWE with\nsuper-polynomial modulus. Prior to this work, the only known blind-unforgeable\nschemes are Lamport's one-time signature and the Winternitz one-time signature,\nand both of them are in the quantum random oracle model.\nFor ring signatures, the recent work by Chatterjee et al. (Crypto'21)\nproposes a definition trying to capture adversaries with quantum access to the\nsigner. However, it is unclear if their definition, when restricted to the\nclassical world, is as strong as the standard security notion for ring\nsignatures. They also present a construction that only partially achieves\n(even) this seeming weak definition, in the sense that the adversary can only\nconduct superposition attacks over the messages, but not the rings. We propose\na new definition that does not suffer from the above issue. Our definition is\nan analog to the blind-unforgeability in the ring signature setting. Moreover,\nassuming the quantum hardness of LWE, we construct a compiler converting any\nblind-unforgeable (ordinary) signatures to a ring signature satisfying our\ndefinition.",

While the\ngenerator models can generate millions of candidates, it is critical to train\nfast and accurate machine learning models to filter out stable, synthesizable\nmaterials with desired properties. However, such efforts to build supervised\nregression or classification screening models have been severely hindered by\nthe lack of unstable or unsynthesizable samples, which usually are not\ncollected and deposited in materials databases such as ICSD and Materials\nProject (MP). At the same time, there are a significant amount of unlabelled\ndata available in these databases. Here we propose a semi-supervised deep\nneural network (TSDNN) model for high-performance formation energy and\nsynthesizability prediction, which is achieved via its unique teacher-student\ndual network architecture and its effective exploitation of the large amount of\nunlabeled data. For formation energy based stability screening, our\nsemi-supervised classifier achieves an absolute 10.3\\% accuracy improvement\ncompared to the baseline CGCNN regression model. For synthesizability\nprediction, our model significantly increases the baseline PU learning's true\npositive rate from 87.9\\% to 97.9\\% using 1/49 model parameters.\nTo further prove the effectiveness of our models, we combined our\nTSDNN-energy and TSDNN-synthesizability models with our CubicGAN generator to\ndiscover novel stable cubic structures.

    "abstract": "We study potential biases of popular cluster quality metrics, such as\nconductance or modularity. We propose a method that uses both stochastic and\npreferential attachment block models construction to generate networks with\npreset community structures, to which quality metrics will be applied. These\nmodels also allow us to generate multi-level structures of varying strength,\nwhich will show if metrics favour partitions into a larger or smaller number of\nclusters. Additionally, we propose another quality metric, the density ratio.\nWe observed that most of the studied metrics tend to favour partitions into a\nsmaller number of big clusters, even when their relative internal and external\nconnectivity are the same. The metrics found to be less biased are modularity\nand density ratio.",

    "title": "Gamifying optimization: a Wasserstein distance-based analysis of human  search",
    "abstract": "The main objective of this paper is to outline a theoretical framework to\ncharacterise humans' decision-making strategies under uncertainty, in\nparticular active learning in a black-box optimization task and trading-off\nbetween information gathering (exploration) and reward seeking (exploitation).\nHumans' decisions making according to these two objectives can be modelled in\nterms of Pareto rationality. If a decision set contains a Pareto efficient\nstrategy, a rational decision maker should always select the dominant strategy\nover its dominated alternatives. A distance from the Pareto frontier determines\nwhether a choice is Pareto rational. To collect data about humans' strategies\nwe have used a gaming application that shows the game field, with previous\ndecisions and observations, as well as the score obtained. The key element in\nthis paper is the representation of behavioural patterns of human learners as a\ndiscrete probability distribution. This maps the problem of the\ncharacterization of humans' behaviour into a space whose elements are\nprobability distributions structured by a distance between histograms, namely\nthe Wasserstein distance (WST). The distributional analysis gives new insights\nabout human search strategies and their deviations from Pareto rationality.\nSince the uncertainty is one of the two objectives defining the Pareto\nfrontier, the analysis has been performed for three different uncertainty\nquantification measures to identify which better explains the Pareto compliant\nbehavioural patterns. Beside the analysis of individual patterns WST has also\nenabled a global analysis computing the barycenters and WST k-means clustering.\nA further analysis has been performed by a decision tree to relate non-Paretian\nbehaviour, characterized by exasperated exploitation, to the dynamics of the\nevolution of the reward seeking process.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides a decision theoretic analysis of bandit experiments. The\nbandit setting corresponds to a dynamic programming problem, but solving this\ndirectly is typically infeasible. Working within the framework of diffusion\nasymptotics, we define a suitable notion of asymptotic Bayes risk for bandit\nsettings. For normally distributed rewards, the minimal Bayes risk can be\ncharacterized as the solution to a nonlinear second-order partial differential\nequation (PDE). Using a limit of experiments approach, we show that this PDE\ncharacterization also holds asymptotically under both parametric and\nnon-parametric distribution of the rewards. The approach further describes the\nstate variables it is asymptotically sufficient to restrict attention to, and\ntherefore suggests a practical strategy for dimension reduction. The upshot is\nthat we can approximate the dynamic programming problem defining the bandit\nsetting with a PDE which can be efficiently solved using sparse matrix\nroutines. We derive near-optimal policies from the numerical solutions to these\nequations. The proposed policies substantially dominate existing methods such\nThompson sampling. The framework also allows for substantial generalizations to\nthe bandit problem such as time discounting and pure exploration motives.",

In this work, we introduce a freely available\ngACSON software for visualization, segmentation, assessment, and morphology\nanalysis of myelinated axons in 3D-EM volumes of brain tissue samples. Methods:\nThe gACSON software is equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI). It\nautomatically segments the intra-axonal space of myelinated axons and their\ncorresponding myelin sheaths and allows manual segmentation, proofreading, and\ninteractive correction of the segmented components. gACSON analyzes the\nmorphology of myelinated axons, such as axonal diameter, axonal eccentricity,\nmyelin thickness, or g-ratio. Results: We illustrate the use of gACSON by\nsegmenting and analyzing myelinated axons in six 3D-EM volumes of rat\nsomatosensory cortex after sham surgery or traumatic brain injury (TBI). Our\nresults suggest that the equivalent diameter of myelinated axons in\nsomatisensory cortex was decreased in TBI animals five months after the injury.\nConclusions: Our results indicate that gACSON is a valuable tool for\nvisualization, segmentation, assessment, and morphology analysis of myelinated\naxons in 3D-EM volumes. gACSON is freely available at\nhttps://github.com/AndreaBehan/g-ACSON under the MIT license.",

It is classified as a Discrete Event Dynamic System\n(DEDS) for which no one agreed upon modelling approach exists. Furthermore,\nDEDS are quite complex.

To further add to this scenario, it is shown\nhow sparsity can be exploited in the CTMDP to develop a computationally\nefficient model. The discounted performance of the SMDP and CTMDP policies are\nevaluated using a Semi-Markov Process simulator. The two policies are\naccompanied by a heuristic policy specifically developed for this polling\nsystem a well as an exhaustive service policy.

    "title": "Accoustate: Auto-annotation of IMU-generated Activity Signatures under  Smart Infrastructure",
    "abstract": "Human activities within smart infrastructures generate a vast amount of IMU\ndata from the wearables worn by individuals. Many existing studies rely on such\nsensory data for human activity recognition (HAR); however, one of the major\nbottlenecks is their reliance on pre-annotated or labeled data. Manual\nhuman-driven annotations are neither scalable nor efficient, whereas existing\nauto-annotation techniques heavily depend on video signatures. Still,\nvideo-based auto-annotation needs high computation resources and has privacy\nconcerns when the data from a personal space, like a smart-home, is transferred\nto the cloud. This paper exploits the acoustic signatures generated from human\nactivities to label the wearables' IMU data at the edge, thus mitigating\nresource requirement and data privacy concerns. We utilize acoustic-based\npre-trained HAR models for cross-modal labeling of the IMU data even when two\nindividuals perform simultaneous but different activities under the same\nenvironmental context. We observe that non-overlapping acoustic gaps exist with\na high probability during the simultaneous activities performed by two\nindividuals in the environment's acoustic context, which helps us resolve the\noverlapping activity signatures to label them individually. A principled\nevaluation of the proposed approach on two real-life in-house datasets further\naugmented to create a dual occupant setup, shows that the framework can\ncorrectly annotate a significant volume of unlabeled IMU data from both\nindividuals with an accuracy of $\\mathbf{82.59\\%}$ ($\\mathbf{\\pm 17.94\\%}$) and\n$\\mathbf{98.32\\%}$ ($\\mathbf{\\pm 3.68\\%}$), respectively, for a workshop and a\nkitchen environment.",

    "abstract": "The quantitative analysis of non-invasive electrophysiology signals from\nelectroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) boils down to the\nidentification of temporal patterns such as evoked responses, transient bursts\nof neural oscillations but also blinks or heartbeats for data cleaning. Several\nworks have shown that these patterns can be extracted efficiently in an\nunsupervised way, e.g., using Convolutional Dictionary Learning. This leads to\nan event-based description of the data. Given these events, a natural question\nis to estimate how their occurrences are modulated by certain cognitive tasks\nand experimental manipulations. To address it, we propose a point process\napproach. While point processes have been used in neuroscience in the past, in\nparticular for single cell recordings (spike trains), techniques such as\nConvolutional Dictionary Learning make them amenable to human studies based on\nEEG/MEG signals. We develop a novel statistical point process model-called\ndriven temporal point processes (DriPP)-where the intensity function of the\npoint process model is linked to a set of point processes corresponding to\nstimulation events. We derive a fast and principled expectation-maximization\n(EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of this model. Simulations reveal\nthat model parameters can be identified from long enough signals. Results on\nstandard MEG datasets demonstrate that our methodology reveals event-related\nneural responses-both evoked and induced-and isolates non-task specific\ntemporal patterns.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding aims to identify the perceptual,\nsemantic, and cognitive content of neural processing based on non-invasively\nmeasured brain activity. Traditional EEG decoding methods have achieved\nmoderate success when applied to data acquired in static, well-controlled lab\nenvironments. However, an open-world environment is a more realistic setting,\nwhere situations affecting EEG recordings can emerge unexpectedly,\nsignificantly weakening the robustness of existing methods. In recent years,\ndeep learning (DL) has emerged as a potential solution for such problems due to\nits superior capacity in feature extraction. It overcomes the limitations of\ndefining `handcrafted' features or features extracted using shallow\narchitectures, but typically requires large amounts of costly,\nexpertly-labelled data - something not always obtainable. Combining DL with\ndomain-specific knowledge may allow for development of robust approaches to\ndecode brain activity even with small-sample data. Although various DL methods\nhave been proposed to tackle some of the challenges in EEG decoding, a\nsystematic tutorial overview, particularly for open-world applications, is\ncurrently lacking. This article therefore provides a comprehensive survey of DL\nmethods for open-world EEG decoding, and identifies promising research\ndirections to inspire future studies for EEG decoding in real-world\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Despite the superior performance of Deep Learning (DL) on numerous\nsegmentation tasks, the DL-based approaches are notoriously overconfident about\ntheir prediction with highly polarized label probability. This is often not\ndesirable for many applications with the inherent label ambiguity even in human\nannotations. This challenge has been addressed by leveraging multiple\nannotations per image and the segmentation uncertainty. However, multiple\nper-image annotations are often not available in a real-world application and\nthe uncertainty does not provide full control on segmentation results to users.\nIn this paper, we propose novel methods to improve the segmentation probability\nestimation without sacrificing performance in a real-world scenario that we\nhave only one ambiguous annotation per image. We marginalize the estimated\nsegmentation probability maps of networks that are encouraged to\nunder-/over-segment with the varying Tversky loss without penalizing balanced\nsegmentation. Moreover, we propose a unified hypernetwork ensemble method to\nalleviate the computational burden of training multiple networks. Our\napproaches successfully estimated the segmentation probability maps that\nreflected the underlying structures and provided the intuitive control on\nsegmentation for the challenging 3D medical image segmentation. Although the\nmain focus of our proposed methods is not to improve the binary segmentation\nperformance, our approaches marginally outperformed the state-of-the-arts.

Factored PCA (FPCA) is a probabilistic extension of PCA for\nmatrix data, which can substantially reduce the number of parameters in PCA\nwhile yield satisfactory performance.

Although the multivariate $t$\ndistribution as a robust modeling tool for vector data has a very long history,\nits application to matrix data is very limited. The main reason is that the\ndimension of the vectorized matrix data is often very high and the higher the\ndimension, the lower the breakdown point that measures the robustness. To solve\nthe robustness problem suffered by FPCA and make it applicable to matrix data,\nin this paper we propose a robust extension of FPCA (RFPCA), which is built\nupon a $t$-type distribution called matrix-variate $t$ distribution.

    "abstract": "Cementless implants have become widely used for total hip replacement\nsurgery. The long-term stability of these implants is achieved by bone growing\naround and into the porous surface of the implant, a process called\nosseointegration. However, debonding of the bone-implant interface can still\noccur due to aseptic implant loosening and insufficient osseointegration, which\nmay have dramatic consequences. The aim of this work is to describe a new 3D\nfinite element frictional contact formulation for the debonding of partially\nosseointegrated implants. The contact model is based on a modified Coulomb's\nfriction law (Immel et al. 2020, Biomech. Model. Mechanobiol.) that takes into\naccount the tangential debonding of the bone-implant interface. This model is\nextended in the direction normal to the bone-implant interface by considering a\ncohesive zone model, to account for adhesion phenomena in the normal direction\nand for adhesive friction of partially bonded interfaces. The model is applied\nto simulate the debonding of an acetabular cup implant. The influence of\npartial osseointegration and adhesive effects on the long-term stability of the\nimplant is assessed. The influence of different patient- and implant-specific\nparameters such as the friction coefficient, the trabecular Young's modulus and\nthe interference fit is also analyzed, in order to determine the optimal\nstability for different configurations.

We address the\nhigh-dimensionality of market observed call prices through an arbitrage-free\nautoencoder that approximates efficient low-dimensional representations of the\nprices while maintaining no static arbitrage in the reconstructed surface.\nGiven a multi-asset universe, we leverage the conditional invertibility\nproperty of normalizing flows and introduce a scalable method to calibrate the\njoint distribution of a set of independent simulators while preserving the\ndynamics of each simulator. Empirical results highlight the goodness of the\ncalibrated simulators and their fidelity.",
