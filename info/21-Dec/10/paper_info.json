    "abstract": "In the context of smart grids and load balancing, daily peak load forecasting\nhas become a critical activity for stakeholders of the energy industry. An\nunderstanding of peak magnitude and timing is paramount for the implementation\nof smart grid strategies such as peak shaving. The modelling approach proposed\nin this paper leverages high-resolution and low-resolution information to\nforecast daily peak demand size and timing. The resulting multi-resolution\nmodelling framework can be adapted to different model classes. The key\ncontributions of this paper are a) a general and formal introduction to the\nmulti-resolution modelling approach, b) a discussion on modelling approaches at\ndifferent resolutions implemented via Generalised Additive Models and Neural\nNetworks and c) experimental results on real data from the UK electricity\nmarket. The results confirm that the predictive performance of the proposed\nmodelling approach is competitive with that of low- and high-resolution\nalternatives.",

This research analyzes how RL market maker agents behaves in\nnon-competitive (only one RL market maker learning at the same time) and\ncompetitive scenarios (multiple RL market markers learning at the same time),\nand how they adapt their strategies in a Sim2Real scope with interesting\nresults.

Applications for such a procedure include generating\ntraining data and building authoring environments. Naive methods for doing this\nfail. One reason is that shading and albedo are quite strongly related; for\nexample, sharp boundaries in shading tend to appear at depth discontinuities,\nwhich usually apparent in albedo. The same scene can be lit in different ways,\nand established theory shows the different lightings form a cone (the\nillumination cone). Novel theory shows that one can use similar scenes to\nestimate the different lightings that apply to a given scene, with bounded\nexpected error. Our method exploits this theory to estimate a representation of\nthe available lighting fields in the form of imputed generators of the\nillumination cone. Our procedure does not require expensive \"inverse graphics\"\ndatasets, and sees no ground truth data of any kind.\nQualitative evaluation suggests the method can erase and restore soft indoor\nshadows, and can \"steer\" light around a scene. We offer a summary quantitative\nevaluation of the method with a novel application of the FID. An extension of\nthe FID allows per-generated-image evaluation.

    "abstract": "Object detection plays a key role in many security-critical systems.\nAdversarial patch attacks, which are easy to implement in the physical world,\npose a serious threat to state-of-the-art object detectors. Developing reliable\ndefenses for object detectors against patch attacks is critical but severely\nunderstudied. In this paper, we propose Segment and Complete defense (SAC), a\ngeneral framework for defending object detectors against patch attacks through\ndetecting and removing adversarial patches. We first train a patch segmenter\nthat outputs patch masks that provide pixel-level localization of adversarial\npatches. We then propose a self adversarial training algorithm to robustify the\npatch segmenter. In addition, we design a robust shape completion algorithm,\nwhich is guaranteed to remove the entire patch from the images given the\noutputs of the patch segmenter are within a certain Hamming distance of the\nground-truth patch masks. Our experiments on COCO and xView datasets\ndemonstrate that SAC achieves superior robustness even under strong adaptive\nattacks with no performance drop on clean images, and generalizes well to\nunseen patch shapes, attack budgets, and unseen attack methods. Furthermore, we\npresent the APRICOT-Mask dataset, which augments the APRICOT dataset with\npixel-level annotations of adversarial patches.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose PATO-a producibility-aware topology optimization\n(TO) framework to help efficiently explore the design space of components\nfabricated using metal additive manufacturing (AM), while ensuring\nmanufacturability with respect to cracking. Specifically, parts fabricated\nthrough Laser Powder Bed Fusion are prone to defects such as warpage or\ncracking due to high residual stress values generated from the steep thermal\ngradients produced during the build process. Maturing the design for such parts\nand planning their fabrication can span months to years, often involving\nmultiple handoffs between design and manufacturing engineers. PATO is based on\nthe a priori discovery of crack-free designs, so that the optimized part can be\nbuilt defect-free at the outset. To ensure that the design is crack free during\noptimization, producibility is explicitly encoded within the standard\nformulation of TO, using a crack index. Multiple crack indices are explored and\nusing experimental validation, maximum shear strain index (MSSI) is shown to be\nan accurate crack index. Simulating the build process is a coupled,\nmulti-physics computation and incorporating it in the TO loop can be\ncomputationally prohibitive. We leverage the current advances in deep\nconvolutional neural networks and present a high-fidelity surrogate model based\non an Attention-based U-Net architecture to predict the MSSI values as a\nspatially varying field over the part's domain. Further, we employ automatic\ndifferentiation to directly compute the gradient of maximum MSSI with respect\nto the input design variables and augment it with the performance-based\nsensitivity field to optimize the design while considering the trade-off\nbetween weight, manufacturability, and functionality.

    "abstract": "Wide-scale electrification of the transportation sector will require careful\nplanning and coordination with the power grid. Left unmanaged, uncoordinated\ncharging of electric vehicles (EVs) at increased levels of penetration will\namplify existing peak loads, potentially outstripping the grid's capacity to\nreliably meet demand. In this paper, we report findings from the OptimizEV\nProject - a real-world pilot study in Upstate New York exploring a novel\napproach to coordinated residential EV charging. The proposed coordination\nmechanism seeks to harness the latent flexibility in EV charging by offering EV\nowners monetary incentives to delay the time required to charge their EVs. Each\ntime an EV owner initiates a charging session, they specify how long they\nintend to leave their vehicle plugged in by selecting from a menu of deadlines\nthat offers lower electricity prices the longer they're willing to delay the\ntime required to charge their EV. Given a collection of active charging\nrequests, a smart charging system dynamically optimizes the power being drawn\nby each EV in real time to minimize strain on the grid, while ensuring that\neach customer's car is fully charged by its deadline. Under the proposed\nincentive mechanism, we find that customers are frequently willing to engage in\noptimized charging sessions, allowing the system to delay the completion of\ntheir charging requests by more than eight hours on average. Using the\nflexibility provided by customers, the smart charging system was shown to be\nhighly effective in shifting the majority of EV charging loads off-peak to fill\nthe night-time valley of the aggregate load curve. Customer opt-in rates\nremained stable over the span of the study, providing empirical evidence in\nsupport of the proposed coordination mechanism as a potentially viable\n\"non-wires alternative\" to meet the increased demand for electricity driven\ngrowing EV adoption.",

    "title": "Ambiguous Dynamic Treatment Regimes: A Reinforcement Learning Approach",
    "abstract": "A main research goal in various studies is to use an observational data set\nand provide a new set of counterfactual guidelines that can yield causal\nimprovements. Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) are widely studied to formalize\nthis process. However, available methods in finding optimal DTRs often rely on\nassumptions that are violated in real-world applications (e.g., medical\ndecision-making or public policy), especially when (a) the existence of\nunobserved confounders cannot be ignored, and (b) the unobserved confounders\nare time-varying (e.g., affected by previous actions). When such assumptions\nare violated, one often faces ambiguity regarding the underlying causal model\nthat is needed to be assumed to obtain an optimal DTR. This ambiguity is\ninevitable, since the dynamics of unobserved confounders and their causal\nimpact on the observed part of the data cannot be understood from the observed\ndata. Motivated by a case study of finding superior treatment regimes for\npatients who underwent transplantation in our partner hospital and faced a\nmedical condition known as New Onset Diabetes After Transplantation (NODAT), we\nextend DTRs to a new class termed Ambiguous Dynamic Treatment Regimes (ADTRs),\nin which the casual impact of treatment regimes is evaluated based on a \"cloud\"\nof potential causal models. We then connect ADTRs to Ambiguous Partially\nObservable Mark Decision Processes (APOMDPs) proposed by Saghafian (2018), and\ndevelop two Reinforcement Learning methods termed Direct Augmented V-Learning\n(DAV-Learning) and Safe Augmented V-Learning (SAV-Learning), which enable using\nthe observed data to efficiently learn an optimal treatment regime. We\nestablish theoretical results for these learning methods, including (weak)\nconsistency and asymptotic normality. We further evaluate the performance of\nthese learning methods both in our case study and in simulation experiments.",

    "abstract": "Machine-part interaction classification is a key capability required by\nCyber-Physical Systems (CPS), a pivotal enabler of Smart Manufacturing (SM).\nWhile previous relevant studies on the subject have primarily focused on time\nseries classification, change point detection is equally important because it\nprovides temporal information on changes in behavior of the machine. In this\nwork, we address point detection and time series classification for\nmachine-part interactions with a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based\nframework. The CNN in this framework utilizes a two-stage encoder-classifier\nstructure for efficient feature representation and convenient deployment\ncustomization for CPS. Though data-driven, the design and optimization of the\nframework are Subject Matter Expertise (SME) guided. An SME defined Finite\nState Machine (FSM) is incorporated into the framework to prohibit intermittent\nmisclassifications. In the case study, we implement the framework to perform\nmachine-part interaction classification on a milling machine, and the\nperformance is evaluated using a testing dataset and deployment simulations.\nThe implementation achieved an average F1-Score of 0.946 across classes on the\ntesting dataset and an average delay of 0.24 seconds on the deployment\nsimulations.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated great success in\nrepresentation learning for graph-structured data. The layer-wise graph\nconvolution in GNNs is shown to be powerful at capturing graph topology. During\nthis process, GNNs are usually guided by pre-defined kernels such as Laplacian\nmatrix, adjacency matrix, or their variants. However, the adoptions of\npre-defined kernels may restrain the generalities to different graphs: mismatch\nbetween graph and kernel would entail sub-optimal performance. For example,\nGNNs that focus on low-frequency information may not achieve satisfactory\nperformance when high-frequency information is significant for the graphs, and\nvice versa. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel framework\n- i.e., namely Adaptive Kernel Graph Neural Network (AKGNN) - which learns to\nadapt to the optimal graph kernel in a unified manner at the first attempt. In\nthe proposed AKGNN, we first design a data-driven graph kernel learning\nmechanism, which adaptively modulates the balance between all-pass and low-pass\nfilters by modifying the maximal eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian. Through\nthis process, AKGNN learns the optimal threshold between high and low frequency\nsignals to relieve the generality problem. Later, we further reduce the number\nof parameters by a parameterization trick and enhance the expressive power by a\nglobal readout function. Extensive experiments are conducted on acknowledged\nbenchmark datasets and promising results demonstrate the outstanding\nperformance of our proposed AKGNN by comparison with state-of-the-art GNNs.

Although previous methods perform well with moderate\ndimensional data, their accuracy starts to degrade in situations with 100s of\nbinary variables. Therefore, we propose the use of decomposable models for\nestimating divergences in high dimensional data.

We conduct formal and experimental analyses to\nexplore the properties of using decomposable models in the context of\ndivergence estimation.

Our key insight is that, by training the\ninference and the generative model together, we allow them to adapt to each\nother and to converge to a better quality model. Our \\textbf{InvGAN}, short for\nInvertable GAN, successfully embeds real images to the latent space of a high\nquality generative model.

Most of the existing methods that rely only on a global generator\nusually suffer from changing unwanted attributes along with the target\nattributes. Recently, hierarchical networks that consist of both a global\nnetwork dealing with the whole image and multiple local networks focusing on\nlocal parts are showing success. However, these methods extract local regions\nby bounding boxes centred around the sparse facial key points which are\nnon-differentiable, inaccurate and unrealistic.

Moreover, a recent study has shown strong correlation between\nfacial attributes and local semantic regions.

We propose a novel convolutional autoencoder for food\nclassification, trained on an augmented UNIMIB2016 dataset and tested on our\nsimulated LTC food intake dataset (12 meal scenarios; up to 15 classes each;\ntop-1 classification accuracy: 88.9%; mean intake error: -0.4 mL$\\pm$36.7 mL).\nNutrient intake estimation by volume was strongly linearly correlated with\nnutrient estimates from mass ($r^2$ 0.92 to 0.99) with good agreement between\nmethods ($\\sigma$= -2.7 to -0.01; zero within each of the limits of agreement).\nThe AFINI-T approach is a deep-learning powered computational nutrient sensing\nsystem that may provide a novel means for more accurately and objectively\ntracking LTC resident food intake to support and prevent malnutrition tracking\nstrategies.",

The resources are further\nsubdivided into three types - offline (whose quantity is known and available at\ntime 0), online-queueable (which arrive online and can be stored in a buffer),\nand online-nonqueueable (which arrive online and must be matched on arrival or\nlost).\nUnder GRG we prove that, (i) our greedy algorithm gets bounded any-time\nregret for matching reward (independent of $t$) when no configuration contains\nboth an online-queueable and an online-nonqueueable resource, and (ii)\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log t)$ expected any-time regret otherwise (we also prove a\nmatching lower bound).

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D object detection aims to localize 3D bounding boxes in an input\nsingle 2D image. It is a highly challenging problem and remains open,\nespecially when no extra information (e.g., depth, lidar and/or multi-frames)\ncan be leveraged in training and/or inference. This paper proposes a simple yet\neffective formulation for monocular 3D object detection without exploiting any\nextra information. It presents the MonoCon method which learns Monocular\nContexts, as auxiliary tasks in training, to help monocular 3D object\ndetection. The key idea is that with the annotated 3D bounding boxes of objects\nin an image, there is a rich set of well-posed projected 2D supervision signals\navailable in training, such as the projected corner keypoints and their\nassociated offset vectors with respect to the center of 2D bounding box, which\nshould be exploited as auxiliary tasks in training. The proposed MonoCon is\nmotivated by the Cramer-Wold theorem in measure theory at a high level. In\nimplementation, it utilizes a very simple end-to-end design to justify the\neffectiveness of learning auxiliary monocular contexts, which consists of three\ncomponents: a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based feature backbone, a number of\nregression head branches for learning the essential parameters used in the 3D\nbounding box prediction, and a number of regression head branches for learning\nauxiliary contexts. After training, the auxiliary context regression branches\nare discarded for better inference efficiency. In experiments, the proposed\nMonoCon is tested in the KITTI benchmark (car, pedestrain and cyclist). It\noutperforms all prior arts in the leaderboard on car category and obtains\ncomparable performance on pedestrian and cyclist in terms of accuracy. Thanks\nto the simple design, the proposed MonoCon method obtains the fastest inference\nspeed with 38.7 fps in comparisons",

    "abstract": "Although detection with Transformer (DETR) is increasingly popular, its\nglobal attention modeling requires an extremely long training period to\noptimize and achieve promising detection performance. Alternative to existing\nstudies that mainly develop advanced feature or embedding designs to tackle the\ntraining issue, we point out that the Region-of-Interest (RoI) based detection\nrefinement can easily help mitigate the difficulty of training for DETR\nmethods. Based on this, we introduce a novel REcurrent Glimpse-based decOder\n(REGO) in this paper. In particular, the REGO employs a multi-stage recurrent\nprocessing structure to help the attention of DETR gradually focus on\nforeground objects more accurately. In each processing stage, visual features\nare extracted as glimpse features from RoIs with enlarged bounding box areas of\ndetection results from the previous stage. Then, a glimpse-based decoder is\nintroduced to provide refined detection results based on both the glimpse\nfeatures and the attention modeling outputs of the previous stage. In practice,\nREGO can be easily embedded in representative DETR variants while maintaining\ntheir fully end-to-end training and inference pipelines. In particular, REGO\nhelps Deformable DETR achieve 44.8 AP on the MSCOCO dataset with only 36\ntraining epochs, compared with the first DETR and the Deformable DETR that\nrequire 500 and 50 epochs to achieve comparable performance, respectively.\nExperiments also show that REGO consistently boosts the performance of\ndifferent DETR detectors by up to 7% relative gain at the same setting of 50\ntraining epochs.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new Hessian inverse free Fully Single Loop\nAlgorithm (FSLA) for bilevel optimization problems. Classic algorithms for\nbilevel optimization admit a double loop structure which is computationally\nexpensive. Recently, several single loop algorithms have been proposed with\noptimizing the inner and outer variable alternatively. However, these\nalgorithms not yet achieve fully single loop. As they overlook the loop needed\nto evaluate the hyper-gradient for a given inner and outer state. In order to\ndevelop a fully single loop algorithm, we first study the structure of the\nhyper-gradient and identify a general approximation formulation of\nhyper-gradient computation that encompasses several previous common approaches,\ne.g. back-propagation through time, conjugate gradient, \\emph{etc.} Based on\nthis formulation, we introduce a new state variable to maintain the historical\nhyper-gradient information. Combining our new formulation with the alternative\nupdate of the inner and outer variables, we propose an efficient fully single\nloop algorithm. We theoretically show that the error generated by the new state\ncan be bounded and our algorithm converges with the rate of $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$.\nFinally, we verify the efficacy our algorithm empirically through multiple\nbilevel optimization based machine learning tasks.",

    "abstract": "Recently, cluster contrastive learning has been proven effective for person\nReID by computing the contrastive loss between the individual feature and the\ncluster memory. However, existing methods that use the individual feature to\nmomentum update the cluster memory are not robust to the noisy samples, such as\nthe samples with wrong annotated labels or the pseudo-labels. Unlike the\nindividual-based updating mechanism, the centroid-based updating mechanism that\napplies the mean feature of each cluster to update the cluster memory is robust\nagainst minority noisy samples. Therefore, we formulate the individual-based\nupdating and centroid-based updating mechanisms in a unified cluster\ncontrastive framework, named Dual Cluster Contrastive learning (DCC), which\nmaintains two types of memory banks: individual and centroid cluster memory\nbanks. Significantly, the individual cluster memory is momentum updated based\non the individual feature.The centroid cluster memory applies the mean feature\nof each cluter to update the corresponding cluster memory. Besides the vallina\ncontrastive loss for each memory, a consistency constraint is applied to\nguarantee the consistency of the output of two memories. Note that DCC can be\neasily applied for unsupervised or supervised person ReID by using ground-truth\nlabels or pseudo-labels generated with clustering method, respectively.\nExtensive experiments on two benchmarks under supervised person ReID and\nunsupervised person ReID demonstrate the superior of the proposed DCC.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we tackle the problem of one-shot unsupervised domain\nadaptation (OSUDA) for semantic segmentation where the segmentors only see one\nunlabeled target image during training. In this case, traditional unsupervised\ndomain adaptation models usually fail since they cannot adapt to the target\ndomain with over-fitting to one (or few) target samples. To address this\nproblem, existing OSUDA methods usually integrate a style-transfer module to\nperform domain randomization based on the unlabeled target sample, with which\nmultiple domains around the target sample can be explored during training.\nHowever, such a style-transfer module relies on an additional set of images as\nstyle reference for pre-training and also increases the memory demand for\ndomain adaptation. Here we propose a new OSUDA method that can effectively\nrelieve such computational burden. Specifically, we integrate several\nstyle-mixing layers into the segmentor which play the role of style-transfer\nmodule to stylize the source images without introducing any learned parameters.\nMoreover, we propose a patchwise prototypical matching (PPM) method to weighted\nconsider the importance of source pixels during the supervised training to\nrelieve the negative adaptation. Experimental results show that our method\nachieves new state-of-the-art performance on two commonly used benchmarks for\ndomain adaptive semantic segmentation under the one-shot setting and is more\nefficient than all comparison approaches.",

In this paper, we propose a new transformer\narchitecture, termed DualFormer, which can effectively and efficiently perform\nspace-time attention for video recognition. Specifically, our DualFormer\nstratifies the full space-time attention into dual cascaded levels, i.e., to\nfirst learn fine-grained local space-time interactions among nearby 3D tokens,\nfollowed by the capture of coarse-grained global dependencies between the query\ntoken and the coarse-grained global pyramid contexts. Different from existing\nmethods that apply space-time factorization or restrict attention computations\nwithin local windows for improving efficiency, our local-global stratified\nstrategy can well capture both short- and long-range spatiotemporal\ndependencies, and meanwhile greatly reduces the number of keys and values in\nattention computation to boost efficiency. Experimental results show the\nsuperiority of DualFormer on five video benchmarks against existing methods.

    "abstract": "Pre-training has become a standard paradigm in many computer vision tasks.\nHowever, most of the methods are generally designed on the RGB image domain.\nDue to the discrepancy between the two-dimensional image plane and the\nthree-dimensional space, such pre-trained models fail to perceive spatial\ninformation and serve as sub-optimal solutions for 3D-related tasks. To bridge\nthis gap, we aim to learn a spatial-aware visual representation that can\ndescribe the three-dimensional space and is more suitable and effective for\nthese tasks. To leverage point clouds, which are much more superior in\nproviding spatial information compared to images, we propose a simple yet\neffective 2D Image and 3D Point cloud Unsupervised pre-training strategy,\ncalled SimIPU. Specifically, we develop a multi-modal contrastive learning\nframework that consists of an intra-modal spatial perception module to learn a\nspatial-aware representation from point clouds and an inter-modal feature\ninteraction module to transfer the capability of perceiving spatial information\nfrom the point cloud encoder to the image encoder, respectively.

Traditionally, route selection is on the basis\nof dedicated surveys, which are costly in time and labor. In this paper, we\nmainly focus attention on planning electric bus routes intelligently, depending\non the unique needs of each region throughout the city. We propose\nClairvoyance, a route planning system that leverages a deep neural network and\na multilayer perceptron to predict the future people's trips and the future\ntransportation carbon emission in the whole city, respectively.

Furthermore, representative features of the two\nneural networks are extracted from the heterogeneous urban datasets.

By optimizing for\nsocietal metrics of traffic such as increased throughput and reduced energy\nconsumption, such methods can derive maneuvers that, if adopted by even a small\nportion of vehicles, may significantly improve the state of traffic for all\nvehicles involved. These methods, however, are hindered in practice by the\ndifficulty of designing efficient and accurate models of traffic, as well as\nthe challenges associated with optimizing for the behaviors of dozens of\ninteracting agents. In response to these challenges, this paper tackles the\nproblem of learning generalizable traffic control strategies in simple\nrepresentations of vehicle driving dynamics. In particular, we look to\nmixed-autonomy ring roads as depictions of instabilities that result in the\nformation of congestion. Within this problem, we design a curriculum learning\nparadigm that exploits the natural extendability of the network to effectively\nlearn behaviors that reduce congestion over long horizons. Next, we study the\nimplications of modeling lane changing on the transferability of policies.

The most advantage of OAM wireless communication\ntechnique is the natural orthogonality among different OAM states. However, one\nof the most disadvantages is the crosstalk among different OAM states which is\nwidely caused by the atmospheric turbulence and misalignment between\ntransmitting and receiving antennas. Considering the OAM-based multiple-input\nmultiple-output (OAM-MIMO) transmission system with unaligned antennas, a new\nchannel model is proposed for performance analysis.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel implicit feature refinement module for high-quality\ninstance segmentation. Existing image/video instance segmentation methods rely\non explicitly stacked convolutions to refine instance features before the final\nprediction. In this paper, we first give an empirical comparison of different\nrefinement strategies,which reveals that the widely-used four consecutive\nconvolutions are not necessary. As an alternative, weight-sharing convolution\nblocks provides competitive performance. When such block is iterated for\ninfinite times, the block output will eventually convergeto an equilibrium\nstate. Based on this observation, the implicit feature refinement (IFR) is\ndeveloped by constructing an implicit function. The equilibrium state of\ninstance features can be obtained by fixed-point iteration via a simulated\ninfinite-depth network. Our IFR enjoys several advantages: 1) simulates an\ninfinite-depth refinement network while only requiring parameters of single\nresidual block; 2) produces high-level equilibrium instance features of global\nreceptive field; 3) serves as a plug-and-play general module easily extended to\nmost object recognition frameworks. Experiments on the COCO and YouTube-VIS\nbenchmarks show that our IFR achieves improved performance on state-of-the-art\nimage/video instance segmentation frameworks, while reducing the parameter\nburden (e.g.1% AP improvement on Mask R-CNN with only 30.0% parameters in mask\nhead).

    "abstract": "Despite overparameterization, deep networks trained via supervised learning\nare easy to optimize and exhibit excellent generalization. One hypothesis to\nexplain this is that overparameterized deep networks enjoy the benefits of\nimplicit regularization induced by stochastic gradient descent, which favors\nparsimonious solutions that generalize well on test inputs. It is reasonable to\nsurmise that deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods could also benefit from\nthis effect. In this paper, we discuss how the implicit regularization effect\nof SGD seen in supervised learning could in fact be harmful in the offline deep\nRL setting, leading to poor generalization and degenerate feature\nrepresentations. Our theoretical analysis shows that when existing models of\nimplicit regularization are applied to temporal difference learning, the\nresulting derived regularizer favors degenerate solutions with excessive\n\"aliasing\", in stark contrast to the supervised learning case. We back up these\nfindings empirically, showing that feature representations learned by a deep\nnetwork value function trained via bootstrapping can indeed become degenerate,\naliasing the representations for state-action pairs that appear on either side\nof the Bellman backup. To address this issue, we derive the form of this\nimplicit regularizer and, inspired by this derivation, propose a simple and\neffective explicit regularizer, called DR3, that counteracts the undesirable\neffects of this implicit regularizer. When combined with existing offline RL\nmethods, DR3 substantially improves performance and stability, alleviating\nunlearning in Atari 2600 games, D4RL domains and robotic manipulation from\nimages.",

    "title": "From Good to Best: Two-Stage Training for Cross-lingual Machine Reading  Comprehension",
    "abstract": "Cross-lingual Machine Reading Comprehension (xMRC) is challenging due to the\nlack of training data in low-resource languages. The recent approaches use\ntraining data only in a resource-rich language like English to fine-tune\nlarge-scale cross-lingual pre-trained language models. Due to the big\ndifference between languages, a model fine-tuned only by a source language may\nnot perform well for target languages. Interestingly, we observe that while the\ntop-1 results predicted by the previous approaches may often fail to hit the\nground-truth answers, the correct answers are often contained in the top-k\npredicted results. Based on this observation, we develop a two-stage approach\nto enhance the model performance. The first stage targets at recall: we design\na hard-learning (HL) algorithm to maximize the likelihood that the top-k\npredictions contain the accurate answer. The second stage focuses on precision:\nan answer-aware contrastive learning (AA-CL) mechanism is developed to learn\nthe fine difference between the accurate answer and other candidates. Our\nextensive experiments show that our model significantly outperforms a series of\nstrong baselines on two cross-lingual MRC benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "Building damage detection after natural disasters like earthquakes is crucial\nfor initiating effective emergency response actions. Remotely sensed very high\nspatial resolution (VHR) imagery can provide vital information due to their\nability to map the affected buildings with high geometric precision. Many\napproaches have been developed to detect damaged buildings due to earthquakes.\nHowever, little attention has been paid to exploiting rich features represented\nin VHR images using Deep Neural Networks (DNN). This paper presents a novel\nsuper-pixel based approach combining DNN and a modified segmentation method, to\ndetect damaged buildings from VHR imagery. Firstly, a modified Fast Scanning\nand Adaptive Merging method is extended to create initial over-segmentation.\nSecondly, the segments are merged based on the Region Adjacent Graph (RAG),\nconsidered an improved semantic similarity criterion composed of Local Binary\nPatterns (LBP) texture, spectral, and shape features. Thirdly, a pre-trained\nDNN using Stacked Denoising Auto-Encoders called SDAE-DNN is presented, to\nexploit the rich semantic features for building damage detection. Deep-layer\nfeature abstraction of SDAE-DNN could boost detection accuracy through learning\nmore intrinsic and discriminative features, which outperformed other methods\nusing state-of-the-art alternative classifiers.

Local differential privacy (LDP), as an\nemerging standard that is suitable for PPDA, has been widely deployed into\nvarious real-world scenarios to analyze massive data while protecting against\nmany forms of privacy breach. In this study, we are mainly concerned with\npiecewise transformation technique (PTT) for analyzing numerical data under\nlocal differential privacy. We provide a principled framework for PTT in the\ncontext of LDP, based on which PTT is studied systematically. As a result, we\nshow that (1) many members in PTTs are asymptotically optimal when used to\nobtain an unbiased estimator for mean of numerical data, and (2) for a given\nprivacy budget, there is PTT that reaches the theoretical low bound with\nrespect to variance. Next, we prove by studying two classes of PTTs in detail\nthat (1) there do not exist optimal PTTs compared to the well-used technique,\ni.e., Duchi's scheme, in terms of the consistency noisy variance, (2) on the\nother hand, one has the ability to find a great number of PTTs that are\nconsistently more optimal than the latter with regard to the worst-case noisy\nvariance, which is never reported so far.

Detecting\nrisky (or bad) sellers on such a payment network is crucial to payment service\nproviders for risk management and legal compliance. In this research, we\nformulate this task as a node classification task. Specifically, we aim to\npredict a label for each seller in a payment network, by analysing its\nproperties and/or interactions. Nodes residing in different parts of a payment\nnetwork can have similar local topology structures. Such local topology\nstructures reveal sellers' business roles, eg., supplier, drop-shipper, or\nretailer. We note that many existing solutions for graph-based node\nclassification only consider node connectivity but not the similarity between\nnode's local topology structure. Motivated by business need, we present a\ndual-path graph convolution network, named DP-GCN, for node classification.\nDP-GCN considers both node connectivity and topology structure similarity. The\nproposed model consists of three main modules: (i) a C-GCN module to capture\nconnectivity relationships between nodes, (ii) a T-GCN module to capture\ntopology structure similarities between nodes, and (iii) a multi-head\nself-attention module to align both properties. We evaluate DP-GCN on seven\nbenchmark datasets against diverse baselines.

However, in safety-critical settings, robustness\non out-of-distribution and long-tail samples is fundamental to circumvent\ndangerous issues, such as the misdetection of damaged or rare cars. In this\nwork, we substantially improve the generalization of 3D object detectors to\nout-of-domain data by taking into account deformed point clouds during\ntraining.

Our approach constrains\n3D points to slide along their sensor view rays while neither adding nor\nremoving any of them.

    "title": "\"What can I cook with these ingredients?\" -- Understanding  cooking-related information needs in conversational search",
    "abstract": "As conversational search becomes more pervasive, it becomes increasingly\nimportant to understand the user's underlying information needs when they\nconverse with such systems in diverse domains. We conduct an in-situ study to\nunderstand information needs arising in a home cooking context as well as how\nthey are verbally communicated to an assistant. A human experimenter plays this\nrole in our study. Based on the transcriptions of utterances, we derive a\ndetailed hierarchical taxonomy of diverse information needs occurring in this\ncontext, which require different levels of assistance to be solved. The\ntaxonomy shows that needs can be communicated through different linguistic\nmeans and require different amounts of context to be understood. In a second\ncontribution we perform classification experiments to determine the feasibility\nof predicting the type of information need a user has during a dialogue using\nthe turn provided. For this multi-label classification problem, we achieve\naverage F1 measures of 40% using BERT-based models. We demonstrate with\nexamples, which types of need are difficult to predict and show why, concluding\nthat models need to include more context information in order to improve both\ninformation need classification and assistance to make such systems usable.",

    "abstract": "Research shows that exposure to suicide-related news media content is\nassociated with suicide rates, with some content characteristics likely having\nharmful and others potentially protective effects. Although good evidence\nexists for a few selected characteristics, systematic large scale\ninvestigations are missing in general, and in particular for social media data.\nWe apply machine learning methods to automatically label large quantities of\nTwitter data. We developed a novel annotation scheme that classifies\nsuicide-related tweets into different message types and problem- vs.\nsolution-focused perspectives. We then trained a benchmark of machine learning\nmodels including a majority classifier, an approach based on word frequency\n(TF-IDF with a linear SVM) and two state-of-the-art deep learning models (BERT,\nXLNet). The two deep learning models achieved the best performance in two\nclassification tasks: First, we classified six main content categories,\nincluding personal stories about either suicidal ideation and attempts or\ncoping, calls for action intending to spread either problem awareness or\nprevention-related information, reportings of suicide cases, and other\nsuicide-related and off-topic tweets. The deep learning models reach accuracy\nscores above 73% on average across the six categories, and F1-scores in between\n69% and 85% for all but the suicidal ideation and attempts category (55%).\nSecond, in separating postings referring to actual suicide from off-topic\ntweets, they correctly labelled around 88% of tweets, with BERT achieving\nF1-scores of 93% and 74% for the two categories. These classification\nperformances are comparable to the state-of-the-art on similar tasks. By making\ndata labeling more efficient, this work enables future large-scale\ninvestigations on harmful and protective effects of various kinds of social\nmedia content on suicide rates and on help-seeking behavior.",

    "abstract": "Quadruped locomotion is rapidly maturing to a degree where robots now\nroutinely traverse a variety of unstructured terrains. However, while gaits can\nbe varied typically by selecting from a range of pre-computed styles, current\nplanners are unable to vary key gait parameters continuously while the robot is\nin motion. The synthesis, on-the-fly, of gaits with unexpected operational\ncharacteristics or even the blending of dynamic manoeuvres lies beyond the\ncapabilities of the current state-of-the-art. In this work we address this\nlimitation by learning a latent space capturing the key stance phases\nconstituting a particular gait. This is achieved via a generative model trained\non a single trot style, which encourages disentanglement such that application\nof a drive signal to a single dimension of the latent state induces holistic\nplans synthesising a continuous variety of trot styles. We demonstrate that\nspecific properties of the drive signal map directly to gait parameters such as\ncadence, foot step height and full stance duration. Due to the nature of our\napproach these synthesised gaits are continuously variable online during robot\noperation and robustly capture a richness of movement significantly exceeding\nthe relatively narrow behaviour seen during training. In addition, the use of a\ngenerative model facilitates the detection and mitigation of disturbances to\nprovide a versatile and robust planning framework. We evaluate our approach on\na real ANYmal quadruped robot and demonstrate that our method achieves a\ncontinuous blend of dynamic trot styles whilst being robust and reactive to\nexternal perturbations.",

    "abstract": "It is challenging to derive explainability for unsupervised or\nstatistical-based face image quality assessment (FIQA) methods. In this work,\nwe propose a novel set of explainability tools to derive reasoning for\ndifferent FIQA decisions and their face recognition (FR) performance\nimplications. We avoid limiting the deployment of our tools to certain FIQA\nmethods by basing our analyses on the behavior of FR models when processing\nsamples with different FIQA decisions. This leads to explainability tools that\ncan be applied for any FIQA method with any CNN-based FR solution using\nactivation mapping to exhibit the network's activation derived from the face\nembedding. To avoid the low discrimination between the general spatial\nactivation mapping of low and high-quality images in FR models, we build our\nexplainability tools in a higher derivative space by analyzing the variation of\nthe FR activation maps of image sets with different quality decisions. We\ndemonstrate our tools and analyze the findings on four FIQA methods, by\npresenting inter and intra-FIQA method analyses. Our proposed tools and the\nanalyses based on them point out, among other conclusions, that high-quality\nimages typically cause consistent low activation on the areas outside of the\ncentral face region, while low-quality images, despite general low activation,\nhave high variations of activation in such areas. Our explainability tools also\nextend to analyzing single images where we show that low-quality images tend to\nhave an FR model spatial activation that strongly differs from what is expected\nfrom a high-quality image where this difference also tends to appear more in\nareas outside of the central face region and does correspond to issues like\nextreme poses and facial occlusions.

Compared with image\nclassification, object detection is a more complex task, and designing specific\nKD methods for object detection is non-trivial. In this work, we elaborately\nstudy the behaviour difference between the teacher and student detection\nmodels, and obtain two intriguing observations: First, the teacher and student\nrank their detected candidate boxes quite differently, which results in their\nprecision discrepancy. Second, there is a considerable gap between the feature\nresponse differences and prediction differences between teacher and student,\nindicating that equally imitating all the feature maps of the teacher is the\nsub-optimal choice for improving the student's accuracy. Based on the two\nobservations, we propose Rank Mimicking (RM) and Prediction-guided Feature\nImitation (PFI) for distilling one-stage detectors, respectively. RM takes the\nrank of candidate boxes from teachers as a new form of knowledge to distill,\nwhich consistently outperforms the traditional soft label distillation. PFI\nattempts to correlate feature differences with prediction differences, making\nfeature imitation directly help to improve the student's accuracy.

In this\npaper, based on the idea of introducing intimate information interaction\nbetween the two information sources, we propose our Siamese Attribute-missing\nGraph Auto-encoder (SAGA).

Several programs of Australian\nregulatory reform for distributed energy resources (DER) have emphasised the\nimportance of placing consumers at the centre of any energy transition, but\nthis has occurred against a haphazard backdrop of proposals for solar export\ntaxes, updated inverter standards, and diminishing feed-in-tariffs.

This\npaper aims to provide a new framework for answering the question: Is there\nstill any remaining model redundancy in a compressed CNN? We begin by\ndeveloping a general statistical formulation of CNNs and compressed CNNs via\nthe tensor decomposition, such that the weights across layers can be summarized\ninto a single tensor. Then, through a rigorous sample complexity analysis, we\nreveal an important discrepancy between the derived sample complexity and the\nnaive parameter counting, which serves as a direct indicator of the model\nredundancy. Motivated by this finding, we introduce a new model redundancy\nmeasure for compressed CNNs, called the $K/R$ ratio, which further allows for\nnonlinear activations.

Although recent approaches deal with sarcasm as a\nclassification problem, it is unclear why an online post is identified as\nsarcastic.

In this paper, we propose a novel problem --\nMultimodal Sarcasm Explanation (MuSE) -- given a multimodal sarcastic post\ncontaining an image and a caption, we aim to generate a natural language\nexplanation to reveal the intended sarcasm. To this end, we develop MORE, a new\ndataset with explanation of 3510 sarcastic multimodal posts. Each explanation\nis a natural language (English) sentence describing the hidden irony. We\nbenchmark MORE by employing a multimodal Transformer-based architecture.

Subsequently, a\nBART-based auto-regressive decoder is used as the generator.

    "abstract": "The multi-task learning (MTL) paradigm can be traced back to an early paper\nof Caruana (1997) in which it was argued that data from multiple tasks can be\nused with the aim to obtain a better performance over learning each task\nindependently. A solution of MTL with conflicting objectives requires modelling\nthe trade-off among them which is generally beyond what a straight linear\ncombination can achieve. A theoretically principled and computationally\neffective strategy is finding solutions which are not dominated by others as it\nis addressed in the Pareto analysis. Multi-objective optimization problems\narising in the multi-task learning context have specific features and require\nadhoc methods. The analysis of these features and the proposal of a new\ncomputational approach represent the focus of this work. Multi-objective\nevolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) can easily include the concept of dominance and\ntherefore the Pareto analysis. The major drawback of MOEAs is a low sample\nefficiency with respect to function evaluations. The key reason for this\ndrawback is that most of the evolutionary approaches do not use models for\napproximating the objective function. Bayesian Optimization takes a radically\ndifferent approach based on a surrogate model, such as a Gaussian Process. In\nthis thesis the solutions in the Input Space are represented as probability\ndistributions encapsulating the knowledge contained in the function\nevaluations. In this space of probability distributions, endowed with the\nmetric given by the Wasserstein distance, a new algorithm MOEA/WST can be\ndesigned in which the model is not directly on the objective function but in an\nintermediate Information Space where the objects from the input space are\nmapped into histograms. Computational results show that the sample efficiency\nand the quality of the Pareto set provided by MOEA/WST are significantly better\nthan in the standard MOEA.",

    "abstract": "Learning rational behaviors in open-world games like Minecraft remains to be\nchallenging for Reinforcement Learning (RL) research due to the compound\nchallenge of partial observability, high-dimensional visual perception and\ndelayed reward. To address this, we propose JueWu-MC, a sample-efficient\nhierarchical RL approach equipped with representation learning and imitation\nlearning to deal with perception and exploration. Specifically, our approach\nincludes two levels of hierarchy, where the high-level controller learns a\npolicy to control over options and the low-level workers learn to solve each\nsub-task. To boost the learning of sub-tasks, we propose a combination of\ntechniques including 1) action-aware representation learning which captures\nunderlying relations between action and representation, 2) discriminator-based\nself-imitation learning for efficient exploration, and 3) ensemble behavior\ncloning with consistency filtering for policy robustness. Extensive experiments\nshow that JueWu-MC significantly improves sample efficiency and outperforms a\nset of baselines by a large margin. Notably, we won the championship of the\nNeurIPS MineRL 2021 research competition and achieved the highest performance\nscore ever.",

    "abstract": "Dense object tracking, the ability to localize specific object points with\npixel-level accuracy, is an important computer vision task with numerous\ndownstream applications in robotics. Existing approaches either compute dense\nkeypoint embeddings in a single forward pass, meaning the model is trained to\ntrack everything at once, or allocate their full capacity to a sparse\npredefined set of points, trading generality for accuracy. In this paper we\nexplore a middle ground based on the observation that the number of relevant\npoints at a given time are typically relatively few, e.g. grasp points on a\ntarget object. Our main contribution is a novel architecture, inspired by\nfew-shot task adaptation, which allows a sparse-style network to condition on a\nkeypoint embedding that indicates which point to track. Our central finding is\nthat this approach provides the generality of dense-embedding models, while\noffering accuracy significantly closer to sparse-keypoint approaches. We\npresent results illustrating this capacity vs. accuracy trade-off, and\ndemonstrate the ability to zero-shot transfer to new object instances\n(within-class) using a real-robot pick-and-place task.",

The decision-maker observes a\nsubset of the processes at any given time instant and obtains a noisy binary\nindicator of whether or not the corresponding process is anomalous. In this\nsetting, we develop an anomaly detection algorithm that chooses the processes\nto be observed at a given time instant, decides when to stop taking\nobservations, and declares the decision on anomalous processes. The objective\nof the detection algorithm is to identify the anomalies with an accuracy\nexceeding the desired value while minimizing the delay in decision making. We\ndevise a centralized algorithm where the processes are jointly selected by a\ncommon agent as well as a decentralized algorithm where the decision of whether\nto select a process is made independently for each process. Our algorithms rely\non a Markov decision process defined using the marginal probability of each\nprocess being normal or anomalous, conditioned on the observations. We\nimplement the detection algorithms using the deep actor-critic reinforcement\nlearning framework. Unlike prior work on this topic that has exponential\ncomplexity in the number of processes, our algorithms have computational and\nmemory requirements that are both polynomial in the number of processes. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of these algorithms using numerical experiments by\ncomparing them with state-of-the-art methods.",

It\nprovides a simple usage framework with short messages and an efficient\napplication programming interface (API) enabling the research community to\nstudy and analyze several aspects of this social network. However, the Twitter\nusage simplicity can lead to malicious handling by various bots.

To this end, a supervised machine learning (ML)\nframework is adopted using an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm,\nwhere the hyper-parameters are tuned via cross-validation.

It is widely known that CNN is deemed\nas a 'black-box', which is hard for understanding the prediction mechanism and\ndebugging the wrong prediction.

In this\npaper, we propose the first completely automatic model diagnosing and treating\ntool, termed as Model Doctor. Based on two discoveries that 1) each category is\nonly correlated with sparse and specific convolution kernels, and 2)\nadversarial samples are isolated while normal samples are successive in the\nfeature space, a simple aggregate gradient constraint is devised for\neffectively diagnosing and optimizing CNN classifiers. The aggregate gradient\nstrategy is a versatile module for mainstream CNN classifiers.

    "abstract": "Tagging based relational triple extraction methods are attracting growing\nresearch attention recently. However, most of these methods take a\nunidirectional extraction framework that first extracts all subjects and then\nextracts objects and relations simultaneously based on the subjects extracted.\nThis framework has an obvious deficiency that it is too sensitive to the\nextraction results of subjects. To overcome this deficiency, we propose a\nbidirectional extraction framework based method that extracts triples based on\nthe entity pairs extracted from two complementary directions. Concretely, we\nfirst extract all possible subject-object pairs from two paralleled directions.\nThese two extraction directions are connected by a shared encoder component,\nthus the extraction features from one direction can flow to another direction\nand vice versa. By this way, the extractions of two directions can boost and\ncomplement each other. Next, we assign all possible relations for each entity\npair by a biaffine model. During training, we observe that the share structure\nwill lead to a convergence rate inconsistency issue which is harmful to\nperformance. So we propose a share-aware learning mechanism to address it. We\nevaluate the proposed model on multiple benchmark datasets. Extensive\nexperimental results show that the proposed model is very effective and it\nachieves state-of-the-art results on all of these datasets. Moreover,\nexperiments show that both the proposed bidirectional extraction framework and\nthe share-aware learning mechanism have good adaptability and can be used to\nimprove the performance of other tagging based methods.

    "abstract": "The security of Deep Learning classifiers is a critical field of study\nbecause of the existence of adversarial attacks. Such attacks usually rely on\nthe principle of transferability, where an adversarial example crafted on a\nsurrogate classifier tends to mislead the target classifier trained on the same\ndataset even if both classifiers have quite different architecture. Ensemble\nmethods against adversarial attacks demonstrate that an adversarial example is\nless likely to mislead multiple classifiers in an ensemble having diverse\ndecision boundaries. However, recent ensemble methods have either been shown to\nbe vulnerable to stronger adversaries or shown to lack an end-to-end\nevaluation. This paper attempts to develop a new ensemble methodology that\nconstructs multiple diverse classifiers using a Pairwise Adversarially Robust\nLoss (PARL) function during the training procedure. PARL utilizes gradients of\neach layer with respect to input in every classifier within the ensemble\nsimultaneously. The proposed training procedure enables PARL to achieve higher\nrobustness against black-box transfer attacks compared to previous ensemble\nmethods without adversely affecting the accuracy of clean examples. We also\nevaluate the robustness in the presence of white-box attacks, where adversarial\nexamples are crafted using parameters of the target classifier.

    "title": "CaSP: Class-agnostic Semi-Supervised Pretraining for Detection and  Segmentation",
    "abstract": "To improve instance-level detection/segmentation performance, existing\nself-supervised and semi-supervised methods extract either very task-unrelated\nor very task-specific training signals from unlabeled data. We argue that these\ntwo approaches, at the two extreme ends of the task-specificity spectrum, are\nsuboptimal for the task performance. Utilizing too little task-specific\ntraining signals causes underfitting to the ground-truth labels of downstream\ntasks, while the opposite causes overfitting to the ground-truth labels. To\nthis end, we propose a novel Class-agnostic Semi-supervised Pretraining (CaSP)\nframework to achieve a more favorable task-specificity balance in extracting\ntraining signals from unlabeled data. Compared to semi-supervised learning,\nCaSP reduces the task specificity in training signals by ignoring class\ninformation in the pseudo labels and having a separate pretraining stage that\nuses only task-unrelated unlabeled data. On the other hand, CaSP preserves the\nright amount of task specificity by leveraging box/mask-level pseudo labels. As\na result, our pretrained model can better avoid underfitting/overfitting to\nground-truth labels when finetuned on the downstream task. Using 3.6M unlabeled\ndata, we achieve a remarkable performance gain of 4.7% over ImageNet-pretrained\nbaseline on object detection. Our pretrained model also demonstrates excellent\ntransferability to other detection and segmentation tasks/frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Recently, records on stereo matching benchmarks are constantly broken by\nend-to-end disparity networks. However, the domain adaptation ability of these\ndeep models is quite limited. Addressing such problem, we present a novel\ndomain-adaptive approach called AdaStereo that aims to align multi-level\nrepresentations for deep stereo matching networks. Compared to previous\nmethods, our AdaStereo realizes a more standard, complete and effective domain\nadaptation pipeline. Firstly, we propose a non-adversarial progressive color\ntransfer algorithm for input image-level alignment. Secondly, we design an\nefficient parameter-free cost normalization layer for internal feature-level\nalignment. Lastly, a highly related auxiliary task, self-supervised\nocclusion-aware reconstruction is presented to narrow the gaps in output space.\nWe perform intensive ablation studies and break-down comparisons to validate\nthe effectiveness of each proposed module. With no extra inference overhead and\nonly a slight increase in training complexity, our AdaStereo models achieve\nstate-of-the-art cross-domain performance on multiple benchmarks, including\nKITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D and DrivingStereo, even outperforming some\nstate-of-the-art disparity networks finetuned with target-domain ground-truths.\nMoreover, based on two additional evaluation metrics, the superiority of our\ndomain-adaptive stereo matching pipeline is further uncovered from more\nperspectives.

In other words, we can make a weak model more\nrobust with the help of a strong teacher model. We ask if instead of learning\nfrom a static teacher, can models \"learn together\" and \"teach each other\" to\nachieve better robustness? In this paper, we study how interactions among\nmodels affect robustness via knowledge distillation. We propose mutual\nadversarial training (MAT), in which multiple models are trained together and\nshare the knowledge of adversarial examples to achieve improved robustness. MAT\nallows robust models to explore a larger space of adversarial samples, and find\nmore robust feature spaces and decision boundaries. Through extensive\nexperiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we demonstrate that MAT can effectively\nimprove model robustness and outperform state-of-the-art methods under\nwhite-box attacks, bringing $\\sim$8% accuracy gain to vanilla adversarial\ntraining (AT) under PGD-100 attacks. In addition, we show that MAT can also\nmitigate the robustness trade-off among different perturbation types, bringing\nas much as 13.1% accuracy gain to AT baselines against the union of $l_\\infty$,\n$l_2$ and $l_1$ attacks.

However, most of the\ncritical scenes of traffic accidents are extremely dynamic and previously\nunseen, which seriously harm the performance of semantic segmentation methods.\nIn addition, the delay of the traditional camera during high-speed driving will\nfurther reduce the contextual information in the time dimension. Therefore, we\npropose to extract dynamic context from event-based data with a higher temporal\nresolution to enhance static RGB images, even for those from traffic accidents\nwith motion blur, collisions, deformations, overturns, etc. Moreover, in order\nto evaluate the segmentation performance in traffic accidents, we provide a\npixel-wise annotated accident dataset, namely DADA-seg, which contains a\nvariety of critical scenarios from traffic accidents.

The XL algorithm (XL for short) is a major approach for solving\nthe $\\mathcal MQ$ problem with linearization over a coefficient field.\nFurthermore, the hybrid approach with XL (h-XL) is a variant of XL guessing\nsome variables beforehand. In this paper, we present a variant of h-XL, which\nwe call the polynomial XL (PXL). In PXL, the whole $n$ variables are divided\ninto $k$ variables to be fixed and the remaining $n-k$ variables as \"main\nvariables\", and we generate the Macaulay matrix with respect to the $n-k$ main\nvariables over a polynomial ring of the $k$ variables.

It is shown that the resulting\nintegrals admit analytical formulae if the triangles are identical or share a\ncommon edge. Moreover, the four-dimensional integrals are reduced to one- or\ntwo-dimensional integrals for triangle pairs with common vertices or disjoint\ntriangles respectively. The efficiency and accuracy of the formulae is\ndemonstrated in numerical experiments.",

    "abstract": "As a category of transfer learning, domain adaptation plays an important role\nin generalizing the model trained in one task and applying it to other similar\ntasks or settings. In speech enhancement, a well-trained acoustic model can be\nexploited to obtain the speech signal in the context of other languages,\nspeakers, and environments. Recent domain adaptation research was developed\nmore effectively with various neural networks and high-level abstract features.\nHowever, the related studies are more likely to transfer the well-trained model\nfrom a rich and more diverse domain to a limited and similar domain. Therefore,\nin this study, the domain adaptation method is proposed in unsupervised speech\nenhancement for the opposite circumstance that transferring to a larger and\nricher domain. On the one hand, the importance-weighting (IW) approach is\nexploited with a variance constrained autoencoder to reduce the shift of shared\nweights between the source and target domains. On the other hand, in order to\ntrain the classifier with the worst-case weights and minimize the risk, the\nminimax method is proposed. Both the proposed IW and minimax methods are\nevaluated from the VOICE BANK and IEEE datasets to the TIMIT dataset. The\nexperiment results show that the proposed methods outperform the\nstate-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient pedestrian detection is crucial for the intelligent\ntransportation system regarding pedestrian safety and mobility, e.g., Advanced\nDriver Assistance Systems, and smart pedestrian crosswalk systems. Among all\npedestrian detection methods, vision-based detection method is demonstrated to\nbe the most effective in previous studies. However, the existing vision-based\npedestrian detection algorithms still have two limitations that restrict their\nimplementations, those being real-time performance as well as the resistance to\nthe impacts of environmental factors, e.g., low illumination conditions. To\naddress these issues, this study proposes a lightweight Illumination and\nTemperature-aware Multispectral Network (IT-MN) for accurate and efficient\npedestrian detection. The proposed IT-MN is an efficient one-stage detector.\nFor accommodating the impacts of environmental factors and enhancing the\nsensing accuracy, thermal image data is fused by the proposed IT-MN with visual\nimages to enrich useful information when visual image quality is limited. In\naddition, an innovative and effective late fusion strategy is also developed to\noptimize the image fusion performance. To make the proposed model implementable\nfor edge computing, the model quantization is applied to reduce the model size\nby 75% while shortening the inference time significantly. The proposed\nalgorithm is evaluated by comparing with the selected state-of-the-art\nalgorithms using a public dataset collected by in-vehicle cameras. The results\nshow that the proposed algorithm achieves a low miss rate and inference time at\n14.19% and 0.03 seconds per image pair on GPU. Besides, the quantized IT-MN\nachieves an inference time of 0.21 seconds per image pair on the edge device,\nwhich also demonstrates the potentiality of deploying the proposed model on\nedge devices as a highly efficient pedestrian detection algorithm.",

We propose an approach to learn abstract motor skills from data\nusing a hierarchical mixture latent variable model. In contrast to existing\nwork, our method exploits a three-level hierarchy of both discrete and\ncontinuous latent variables, to capture a set of high-level behaviours while\nallowing for variance in how they are executed. We demonstrate in manipulation\ndomains that the method can effectively cluster offline data into distinct,\nexecutable behaviours, while retaining the flexibility of a continuous latent\nvariable model. The resulting skills can be transferred and fine-tuned on new\ntasks, unseen objects, and from state to vision-based policies, yielding better\nsample efficiency and asymptotic performance compared to existing skill- and\nimitation-based methods.

Conventional techniques for parameter inference and state estimation\ntypically rely on a precise definition of the state space and its dynamics.\nWhile this is appropriate for rigid objects and robot states, it is challenging\nto define the state space of a deformable object and how it evolves in time. In\nthis work, we pose the problem of inferring physical parameters of deformable\nobjects as a probabilistic inference task defined with a simulator. We propose\na novel methodology for extracting state information from image sequences via a\ntechnique to represent the state of a deformable object as a distribution\nembedding. This allows to incorporate noisy state observations directly into\nmodern Bayesian simulation-based inference tools in a principled manner. Our\nexperiments confirm that we can estimate posterior distributions of physical\nproperties, such as elasticity, friction and scale of highly deformable\nobjects, such as cloth and ropes.

This algorithmic problem\nasks whether a given tile system uniquely assembles a specific assembly. The\ncomplexity of this problem in the 2-Handed Assembly Model (2HAM) at a constant\ntemperature is a long-standing open problem since the model was introduced.\nPreviously, only membership in the class coNP was known and that the problem is\nin P if the temperature is one ($\\tau=1$). The problem is known to be hard for\nmany generalizations of the model, such as allowing one step into the third\ndimension or allowing the temperature of the system to be a variable, but the\nmost fundamental version has remained open.\nIn this paper, we prove the UAV problem in the 2HAM is hard even with a small\nconstant temperature ($\\tau = 2$), and finally answer the complexity of this\nproblem (open since 2013). Further, this result proves that UAV in the staged\nself-assembly model is coNP-complete with a single bin and stage (open since\n2007), and that UAV in the q-tile model is also coNP-complete (open since\n2004). We reduce from Monotone Planar 3-SAT with Neighboring Variable Pairs, a\nspecial case of 3SAT recently proven to be NP-hard. We accompany this reduction\nwith a positive result showing that UAV is solvable in polynomial time with the\npromise that the given target assembly will have a tree-shaped bond graph,\ni.e., contains no cycles.

Due to the expensive quadratic\ncost of the attention mechanism, either a large patch size is used, resulting\nin coarse-grained global interactions, or alternatively, attention is applied\nonly on a local region of the image, at the expense of long-range interactions.\nIn this work, we propose an approach that allows for both coarse global\ninteractions and fine-grained local interactions already at early layers of a\nvision transformer.\nAt the core of our method is the application of local and global attention\nlayers. In the local attention layer, we apply attention to each patch and its\nlocal shifts, resulting in virtually located local patches, which are not bound\nto a single, specific location. These virtually located patches are then used\nin a global attention layer. The separation of the attention layer into local\nand global counterparts allows for a low computational cost in the number of\npatches, while still supporting data-dependent localization already at the\nfirst layer, as opposed to the static positioning in other visual transformers.\nOur method is shown to be superior to both convolutional and transformer-based\nmethods for image classification on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet.

Echo chambers promote conspiracy theories about the virus and are\nfound to be linked to vaccine hesitancy, less compliance with mask mandates,\nand the practice of social distancing. Moreover, the problem of echo chambers\nis connected to other pertinent issues like political polarization and the\nspread of misinformation.

We survey the\nrelated literature to understand the attributes of echo chambers and how they\naffect the individual and society at large. Additionally, we show the\nmechanisms, both algorithmic and psychological, that lead to the formation of\necho chambers. These mechanisms could be manifested in two forms: (1) the bias\nof social media's recommender systems and (2) internal biases such as\nconfirmation bias and homophily.

    "title": "Estimating the Longest Increasing Subsequence in Nearly Optimal Time",
    "abstract": "Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) is a fundamental statistic of a\nsequence, and has been studied for decades. While the LIS of a sequence of\nlength $n$ can be computed exactly in time $O(n\\log n)$, the complexity of\nestimating the (length of the) LIS in sublinear time, especially when LIS $\\ll\nn$, is still open.\nWe show that for any integer $n$ and any $\\lambda = o(1)$, there exists a\n(randomized) non-adaptive algorithm that, given a sequence of length $n$ with\nLIS $\\ge \\lambda n$, approximates the LIS up to a factor of $1/\\lambda^{o(1)}$\nin $n^{o(1)} / \\lambda$ time.\nOur algorithm improves upon prior work substantially in terms of both\napproximation and run-time: (i) we provide the first sub-polynomial\napproximation for LIS in sub-linear time; and (ii) our run-time complexity\nessentially matches the trivial sample complexity lower bound of\n$\\Omega(1/\\lambda)$, which is required to obtain any non-trivial approximation\nof the LIS.\nAs part of our solution, we develop two novel ideas which may be of\nindependent interest: First, we define a new Genuine-LIS problem, where each\nsequence element may either be genuine or corrupted. In this model, the user\nreceives unrestricted access to actual sequence, but does not know apriori\nwhich elements are genuine. The goal is to estimate the LIS using genuine\nelements only, with the minimal number of \"genuiness tests\". The second idea,\nPrecision Forest, enables accurate estimations for composition of general\nfunctions from \"coarse\" (sub-)estimates. Precision Forest essentially\ngeneralizes classical precision sampling, which works only for summations. As a\ncentral tool, the Precision Forest is initially pre-processed on a set of\nsamples, which thereafter is repeatedly reused by multiple sub-parts of the\nalgorithm, improving their amortized complexity.",

    "abstract": "Loss functions play an important role in training deep-network-based object\ndetectors. The most widely used evaluation metric for object detection is\nAverage Precision (AP), which captures the performance of localization and\nclassification sub-tasks simultaneously. However, due to the non-differentiable\nnature of the AP metric, traditional object detectors adopt separate\ndifferentiable losses for the two sub-tasks. Such a mis-alignment issue may\nwell lead to performance degradation. To address this, existing works seek to\ndesign surrogate losses for the AP metric manually, which requires expertise\nand may still be sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose Parameterized AP Loss,\nwhere parameterized functions are introduced to substitute the\nnon-differentiable components in the AP calculation. Different AP\napproximations are thus represented by a family of parameterized functions in a\nunified formula. Automatic parameter search algorithm is then employed to\nsearch for the optimal parameters. Extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark\nwith three different object detectors (i.e., RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN, and\nDeformable DETR) demonstrate that the proposed Parameterized AP Loss\nconsistently outperforms existing handcrafted losses.

Specifically, to combine the\nnovel view synthesis capability of NeRF and the controllable manipulation\nability of latent representations from generative models, we introduce a\ndisentangled conditional NeRF architecture that allows individual control over\nboth shape and appearance.

    "title": "Neural Radiance Fields for Outdoor Scene Relighting",
    "abstract": "Photorealistic editing of outdoor scenes from photographs requires a profound\nunderstanding of the image formation process and an accurate estimation of the\nscene geometry, reflectance and illumination. A delicate manipulation of the\nlighting can then be performed while keeping the scene albedo and geometry\nunaltered. We present NeRF-OSR, i.e., the first approach for outdoor scene\nrelighting based on neural radiance fields. In contrast to the prior art, our\ntechnique allows simultaneous editing of both scene illumination and camera\nviewpoint using only a collection of outdoor photos shot in uncontrolled\nsettings. Moreover, it enables direct control over the scene illumination, as\ndefined through a spherical harmonics model. It also includes a dedicated\nnetwork for shadow reproduction, which is crucial for high-quality outdoor\nscene relighting. To evaluate the proposed method, we collect a new benchmark\ndataset of several outdoor sites, where each site is photographed from multiple\nviewpoints and at different timings. For each timing, a 360 degrees environment\nmap is captured together with a colour-calibration chequerboard to allow\naccurate numerical evaluations on real data against ground truth. Comparisons\nagainst state of the art show that NeRF-OSR enables controllable lighting and\nviewpoint editing at higher quality and with realistic self-shadowing\nreproduction. Our method and the dataset will be made publicly available at\nhttps://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/NeRF-OSR/.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning has shown its great potential to extract powerful\nvisual representations without human annotations. Various works are proposed to\ndeal with self-supervised learning from different perspectives: (1) contrastive\nlearning methods (e.g., MoCo, SimCLR) utilize both positive and negative\nsamples to guide the training direction; (2) asymmetric network methods (e.g.,\nBYOL, SimSiam) get rid of negative samples via the introduction of a predictor\nnetwork and the stop-gradient operation; (3) feature decorrelation methods\n(e.g., Barlow Twins, VICReg) instead aim to reduce the redundancy between\nfeature dimensions. These methods appear to be quite different in the designed\nloss functions from various motivations. The final accuracy numbers also vary,\nwhere different networks and tricks are utilized in different works. In this\nwork, we demonstrate that these methods can be unified into the same form.\nInstead of comparing their loss functions, we derive a unified formula through\ngradient analysis. Furthermore, we conduct fair and detailed experiments to\ncompare their performances. It turns out that there is little gap between these\nmethods, and the use of momentum encoder is the key factor to boost\nperformance. From this unified framework, we propose UniGrad, a simple but\neffective gradient form for self-supervised learning. It does not require a\nmemory bank or a predictor network, but can still achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance and easily adopt other training strategies. Extensive experiments\non linear evaluation and many downstream tasks also show its effectiveness.\nCode shall be released.",

    "abstract": "Advanced deep learning (DL) algorithms may predict the patient's risk of\ndeveloping breast cancer based on the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System\n(BI-RADS) and density standards. Recent studies have suggested that the\ncombination of multi-view analysis improved the overall breast exam\nclassification. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view DL approach for\nBI-RADS and density assessment of mammograms. The proposed approach first\ndeploys deep convolutional networks for feature extraction on each view\nseparately. The extracted features are then stacked and fed into a Light\nGradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) classifier to predict BI-RADS and density\nscores. We conduct extensive experiments on both the internal mammography\ndataset and the public dataset Digital Database for Screening Mammography\n(DDSM). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach\noutperforms the single-view classification approach on two benchmark datasets\nby huge margins (5% on the internal dataset and 10% on the DDSM dataset). These\nresults highlight the vital role of combining multi-view information to improve\nthe performance of breast cancer risk prediction.",

    "title": "Revisiting Global Statistics Aggregation for Improving Image Restoration",
    "abstract": "Global spatial statistics, which are aggregated along entire spatial\ndimensions, are widely used in top-performance image restorers. For example,\nmean, variance in Instance Normalization (IN) which is adopted by HINet, and\nglobal average pooling (i.e. mean) in Squeeze and Excitation (SE) which is\napplied to MPRNet. This paper first shows that statistics aggregated on the\npatches-based/entire-image-based feature in the training/testing phase\nrespectively may distribute very differently and lead to performance\ndegradation in image restorers. It has been widely overlooked by previous\nworks. To solve this issue, we propose a simple approach, Test-time Local\nStatistics Converter (TLSC), that replaces the region of statistics aggregation\noperation from global to local, only in the test time. Without retraining or\nfinetuning, our approach significantly improves the image restorer's\nperformance. In particular, by extending SE with TLSC to the state-of-the-art\nmodels, MPRNet boost by 0.65 dB in PSNR on GoPro dataset, achieves 33.31 dB,\nexceeds the previous best result 0.6 dB. In addition, we simply apply TLSC to\nthe high-level vision task, i.e. semantic segmentation, and achieves\ncompetitive results. Extensive quantity and quality experiments are conducted\nto demonstrate TLSC solves the issue with marginal costs while significant\ngain.

    "abstract": "Characterized by tremendous spectral information, hyperspectral image is able\nto detect subtle changes and discriminate various change classes for change\ndetection. The recent research works dominated by hyperspectral binary change\ndetection, however, cannot provide fine change classes information. And most\nmethods incorporating spectral unmixing for hyperspectral multiclass change\ndetection (HMCD), yet suffer from the neglection of temporal correlation and\nerror accumulation. In this study, we proposed an unsupervised Binary Change\nGuided hyperspectral multiclass change detection Network (BCG-Net) for HMCD,\nwhich aims at boosting the multiclass change detection result and unmixing\nresult with the mature binary change detection approaches. In BCG-Net, a novel\npartial-siamese united-unmixing module is designed for multi-temporal spectral\nunmixing, and a groundbreaking temporal correlation constraint directed by the\npseudo-labels of binary change detection result is developed to guide the\nunmixing process from the perspective of change detection, encouraging the\nabundance of the unchanged pixels more coherent and that of the changed pixels\nmore accurate. Moreover, an innovative binary change detection rule is put\nforward to deal with the problem that traditional rule is susceptible to\nnumerical values. The iterative optimization of the spectral unmixing process\nand the change detection process is proposed to eliminate the accumulated\nerrors and bias from unmixing result to change detection result. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our proposed BCG-Net could achieve\ncomparative or even outstanding performance of multiclass change detection\namong the state-of-the-art approaches and gain better spectral unmixing results\nat the same time.",

    "abstract": "In model-based medical image analysis, three features of interest are the\nshape of structures of interest, their relative pose, and image intensity\nprofiles representative of some physical property. Often, these are modelled\nseparately through statistical models by decomposing the object's features into\na set of basis functions through principal geodesic analysis or principal\ncomponent analysis. This study presents a statistical modelling method for\nautomatic learning of shape, pose and intensity features in medical images\nwhich we call the Dynamic multi feature-class Gaussian process models\n(DMFC-GPM). A DMFC-GPM is a Gaussian process (GP)-based model with a shared\nlatent space that encodes linear and non-linear variation. Our method is\ndefined in a continuous domain with a principled way to represent shape, pose\nand intensity feature classes in a linear space, based on deformation fields. A\ndeformation field-based metric is adapted in the method for modelling shape and\nintensity feature variation as well as for comparing rigid transformations\n(pose). Moreover, DMFC-GPMs inherit properties intrinsic to GPs including\nmarginalisation and regression. Furthermore, they allow for adding additional\npose feature variability on top of those obtained from the image acquisition\nprocess; what we term as permutation modelling. For image analysis tasks using\nDMFC-GPMs, we adapt Metropolis-Hastings algorithms making the prediction of\nfeatures fully probabilistic. We validate the method using controlled synthetic\ndata and we perform experiments on bone structures from CT images of the\nshoulder to illustrate the efficacy of the model for pose and shape feature\nprediction. The model performance results suggest that this new modelling\nparadigm is robust, accurate, accessible, and has potential applications\nincluding the management of musculoskeletal disorders and clinical decision\nmaking",

To push the boundaries of molecular\nrepresentation learning, we present PhysChem, a novel neural architecture that\nlearns molecular representations via fusing physical and chemical information\nof molecules. PhysChem is composed of a physicist network (PhysNet) and a\nchemist network (ChemNet). PhysNet is a neural physical engine that learns\nmolecular conformations through simulating molecular dynamics with\nparameterized forces; ChemNet implements geometry-aware deep message-passing to\nlearn chemical / biomedical properties of molecules. Two networks specialize in\ntheir own tasks and cooperate by providing expertise to each other. By fusing\nphysical and chemical information, PhysChem achieved state-of-the-art\nperformances on MoleculeNet, a standard molecular machine learning benchmark.\nThe effectiveness of PhysChem was further corroborated on cutting-edge datasets\nof SARS-CoV-2.",

Understanding modal\nregression's theoretical behavior can be fundamental in learning theory.\nDespite significant progress in characterizing its statistical property, the\nmajority of the results are based on the assumption that samples are\nindependent and identical distributed (i.i.d.), which is too restrictive for\nreal-world applications. This paper concerns the statistical property of\nregularized modal regression (RMR) within an important dependence structure -\nMarkov dependent. Specifically, we establish the upper bound for RMR estimator\nunder moderate conditions and give an explicit learning rate. Our results show\nthat the Markov dependence impacts on the generalization error in the way that\nsample size would be discounted by a multiplicative factor depending on the\nspectral gap of underlying Markov chain.

Modeling PPIs is useful for many biomedical applications, such as\nvaccine design, antibody therapeutics, and peptide drug discovery. Pre-training\na protein model to learn effective representation is critical for PPIs. Most\npre-training models for PPIs are sequence-based, which naively adopt the\nlanguage models used in natural language processing to amino acid sequences.\nMore advanced works utilize the structure-aware pre-training technique, taking\nadvantage of the contact maps of known protein structures. However, neither\nsequences nor contact maps can fully characterize structures and functions of\nthe proteins, which are closely related to the PPI problem. Inspired by this\ninsight, we propose a multimodal protein pre-training model with three\nmodalities: sequence, structure, and function (S2F). Notably, instead of using\ncontact maps to learn the amino acid-level rigid structures, we encode the\nstructure feature with the topology complex of point clouds of heavy atoms. It\nallows our model to learn structural information about not only the backbones\nbut also the side chains. Moreover, our model incorporates the knowledge from\nthe functional description of proteins extracted from literature or manual\nannotations. Our experiments show that the S2F learns protein embeddings that\nachieve good performances on a variety of PPIs tasks, including cross-species\nPPI, antibody-antigen affinity prediction, antibody neutralization prediction\nfor SARS-CoV-2, and mutation-driven binding affinity change prediction.",

With growing computational power and availability of multichannel\nmicrophone recordings, prior works have aimed to incorporate spatial statistics\nalong with spectral information to boost up performance. Despite an improvement\nin enhancement performance of mono output, the spatial image preservation and\nsubjective evaluations have not gained much attention in the literature. This\npaper proposes a novel stereo-aware framework for speech enhancement, i.e., a\ntraining loss for deep learning-based speech enhancement to preserve the\nspatial image while enhancing the stereo mixture. The proposed framework is\nmodel independent, hence it can be applied to any deep learning based\narchitecture. We provide an extensive objective and subjective evaluation of\nthe trained models through a listening test. We show that by regularizing for\nan image preservation loss, the overall performance is improved, and the stereo\naspect of the speech is better preserved.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the single step time domain method named HnH-NRSE,\nwhihc is designed for simultaneous speech intelligibility and quality\nimprovement under noisy-reverberant conditions. In this solution, harmonic and\nnon-harmonic elements of speech are separated by applying zero-crossing and\nenergy criteria. An objective evaluation of the its non-stationarity degree is\nfurther used for an adaptive gain to treat masking components. No prior\nknowledge of speech statistics or room information is required for this\ntechnique. Additionally, two combined solutions, IRMO and IRMN, are proposed as\ncomposite methods for improvement on noisy-reverberant speech signals. The\nproposed and baseline methods are evaluated considering two intelligibility and\nthree quality measures, applied for the objective prediction. The results show\nthat the proposed scheme leads to a higher intelligibility and quality\nimprovement when compared to competing methods in most scenarios. Additionally,\na perceptual intelligibility listening test is performed, which corroborates\nwith these results. Furthermore, the proposed HnH-NRSE solution attains SRMR\nquality measure with similar results when compared to the composed IRMO and\nIRMN techniques.",

The\nreliable computation of fluids has been a long-lasting challenge due to\nnonlinear interactions over multiple spatio-temporal scales. The compressible\nNavier-Stokes equations govern compressible flows and allow for complex\nphenomena like turbulence and shocks. Despite tremendous progress in hardware\nand software, capturing the smallest length-scales in fluid flows still\nintroduces prohibitive computational cost for real-life applications.

    "abstract": "The world is currently experiencing an ongoing pandemic of an infectious\ndisease named coronavirus disease 2019 (i.e., COVID-19), which is caused by the\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Computed\nTomography (CT) plays an important role in assessing the severity of the\ninfection and can also be used to identify those symptomatic and asymptomatic\nCOVID-19 carriers. With a surge of the cumulative number of COVID-19 patients,\nradiologists are increasingly stressed to examine the CT scans manually.\nTherefore, an automated 3D CT scan recognition tool is highly in demand since\nthe manual analysis is time-consuming for radiologists and their fatigue can\ncause possible misjudgment. However, due to various technical specifications of\nCT scanners located in different hospitals, the appearance of CT images can be\nsignificantly different leading to the failure of many automated image\nrecognition approaches. The multi-domain shift problem for the multi-center and\nmulti-scanner studies is therefore nontrivial that is also crucial for a\ndependable recognition and critical for reproducible and objective diagnosis\nand prognosis. In this paper, we proposed a COVID-19 CT scan recognition model\nnamely coronavirus information fusion and diagnosis network (CIFD-Net) that can\nefficiently handle the multi-domain shift problem via a new robust weakly\nsupervised learning paradigm. Our model can resolve the problem of different\nappearance in CT scan images reliably and efficiently while attaining higher\naccuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Sparse-view CT reconstruction is important in a wide range of applications\ndue to limitations on cost, acquisition time, or dosage. However, traditional\ndirect reconstruction methods such as filtered back-projection (FBP) lead to\nlow-quality reconstructions in the sub-Nyquist regime. In contrast, deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) can produce high-quality reconstructions from sparse and noisy\ndata, e.g. through post-processing of FBP reconstructions, as can model-based\niterative reconstruction (MBIR), albeit at a higher computational cost.\nIn this paper, we introduce a direct-reconstruction DNN method called\nRecurrent Stacked Back Projection (RSBP) that uses sequentially-acquired\nbackprojections of individual views as input to a recurrent convolutional LSTM\nnetwork. The SBP structure maintains all information in the sinogram, while the\nrecurrent processing exploits the correlations between adjacent views and\nproduces an updated reconstruction after each new view. We train our network on\nsimulated data and test on both simulated and real data and demonstrate that\nRSBP outperforms both DNN post-processing of FBP images and basic MBIR, with a\nlower computational cost than MBIR.",

R3M aims to accelerate the EM validations of DCMs\nwith varied codebooks, which involves the analysis of a group of similar but\ndistinct coding patterns. The method transforms general DCMs to rigorously\nperiodic arrays by replacing each coding unit with the macro unit, which\ncomprises all possible coding states. The system matrix corresponding to the\nrigorously periodic array is globally shared for DCMs with arbitrary codebooks\nvia implicit retrieval. The discrepancy of the interactions for edge and corner\nunits are precluded by the basis extension of periodic boundaries. Moreover,\nthe hierarchical pattern exploitation algorithm is leveraged to efficiently\nassemble the system matrix for further acceleration. Due to the fully\nutilization of the rigid periodicity, the computational complexity of R3M is\ntheoretically lower than that of $\\mathcal{H}$-matrix within the same paradigm.\nNumerical results for two types of DCMs indicate that R3M is accurate in\ncomparison with commercial software.

    "abstract": "An important problem in machine learning is the ability to learn tasks in a\nsequential manner. If trained with standard first-order methods most models\nforget previously learned tasks when trained on a new task, which is often\nreferred to as catastrophic forgetting. A popular approach to overcome\nforgetting is to regularize the loss function by penalizing models that perform\npoorly on previous tasks. For example, elastic weight consolidation (EWC)\nregularizes with a quadratic form involving a diagonal matrix build based on\npast data. While EWC works very well for some setups, we show that, even under\notherwise ideal conditions, it can provably suffer catastrophic forgetting if\nthe diagonal matrix is a poor approximation of the Hessian matrix of previous\ntasks. We propose a simple approach to overcome this: Regularizing training of\na new task with sketches of the Jacobian matrix of past data. This provably\nenables overcoming catastrophic forgetting for linear models and for wide\nneural networks, at the cost of memory. The overarching goal of this paper is\nto provided insights on when regularization-based continual learning algorithms\nwork and under what memory costs.",
