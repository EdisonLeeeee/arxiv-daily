    "abstract": "As the demand of real time computing increases day by day, there is a major\nparadigm shift in processing platform of real time system from single core to\nmulti-core platform which provides advantages like higher throughput, linear\npower consumption, efficient utilization of processor cores and high\nperformance per unit cost over the many single core processors unit. Currently\navailable most popular real time schedulers for multi-core domain are\npartitioned and global scheduling and these schedulers not suitable to\nefficiently use this multi-core platform efficiently. Although,\nsemi-partitioned algorithms increases utilization bound by using spare\ncapacities left by partitioning via global scheduling, it has a inherent\ndisadvantage of off-line task splitting. Although, semi-partitioned algorithms\nincreases utilization bound by using spare capacities left by partitioning via\nglobal scheduling, it has a inherent disadvantage of off-line task splitting.\nTo overcome these problems of multi-core real time scheduling algorithm new\ndynamic cluster based multi-core real time scheduling algorithm proposed which\nis hybrid scheduling approach.

    "title": "BMPQ: Bit-Gradient Sensitivity Driven Mixed-Precision Quantization of  DNNs from Scratch",
    "abstract": "Large DNNs with mixed-precision quantization can achieve ultra-high\ncompression while retaining high classification performance. However, because\nof the challenges in finding an accurate metric that can guide the optimization\nprocess, these methods either sacrifice significant performance compared to the\n32-bit floating-point (FP-32) baseline or rely on a compute-expensive,\niterative training policy that requires the availability of a pre-trained\nbaseline. To address this issue, this paper presents BMPQ, a training method\nthat uses bit gradients to analyze layer sensitivities and yield\nmixed-precision quantized models. BMPQ requires a single training iteration but\ndoes not need a pre-trained baseline. It uses an integer linear program (ILP)\nto dynamically adjust the precision of layers during training, subject to a\nfixed hardware budget. To evaluate the efficacy of BMPQ, we conduct extensive\nexperiments with VGG16 and ResNet18 on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet\ndatasets. Compared to the baseline FP-32 models, BMPQ can yield models that\nhave 15.4x fewer parameter bits with a negligible drop in accuracy. Compared to\nthe SOTA \"during training\", mixed-precision training scheme, our models are\n2.1x, 2.2x, and 2.9x smaller, on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet,\nrespectively, with an improved accuracy of up to 14.54%.",

    "abstract": "Global food insecurity is expected to worsen in the coming decades with the\naccelerated rate of climate change and the rapidly increasing population. In\nthis vein, it is important to remove inefficiencies at every level of food\nproduction. The recent advances in deep learning can help reduce such\ninefficiencies, yet their application has not yet become mainstream throughout\nthe industry, inducing economic costs at a massive scale. To this point, modern\ntechniques such as CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) have been applied to\nRPQD (Raw Produce Quality Detection) tasks. On the other hand, Transformer's\nsuccessful debut in the vision among other modalities led us to expect a better\nperformance with these Transformer-based models in RPQD. In this work, we\nexclusively investigate the recent state-of-the-art Swin (Shifted Windows)\nTransformer which computes self-attention in both intra- and inter-window\nfashion. We compare Swin Transformer against CNN models on four RPQD image\ndatasets, each containing different kinds of raw produce: fruits and\nvegetables, fish, pork, and beef. We observe that Swin Transformer not only\nachieves better or competitive performance but also is data- and\ncompute-efficient, making it ideal for actual deployment in real-world setting.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale empirical study on\nRPQD task, which we hope will gain more attention in future works.",

In\norder to implement and evaluate these algorithms, we built new subsystems and\nplugins for an open-source dispersed computing framework called Jupiter.\nExperiments with varying DAG structures indicate that: 1) TPHEFT can\nsignificantly improve throughput performance compared to HEFT (up to 2.3 times\nin our experiments), with greater gains when there is less degree of\nparallelism in the DAG, 2) Node splitting can potentially improve performance\nover a baseline schedule, with greater gains when there's an imbalanced\nallocation of computation or inter-task communication, and 3) Task duplication\ngenerally gives improvements only when running upon a baseline that places\ncommunication over slow links.

In this paper, we focus on teasing out\nwhat parts of the language supervision are essential for training zero-shot\nimage classification models. Through extensive and careful experiments, we show\nthat: 1) A simple Bag-of-Words (BoW) caption could be used as a replacement for\nmost of the image captions in the dataset.

    "abstract": "Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) has continuously established new\nmilestones in the computer vision field, while the high computation and memory\ncost makes its propagation in industrial production difficult. Pruning, a\ntraditional model compression paradigm for hardware efficiency, has been widely\napplied in various DNN structures. Nevertheless, it stays ambiguous on how to\nperform exclusive pruning on the ViT structure. Considering three key points:\nthe structural characteristics, the internal data pattern of ViTs, and the\nrelated edge device deployment, we leverage the input token sparsity and\npropose a computation-aware soft pruning framework, which can be set up on\nvanilla Transformers of both flatten and CNN-type structures, such as\nPooling-based ViT (PiT). More concretely, we design a dynamic attention-based\nmulti-head token selector, which is a lightweight module for adaptive\ninstance-wise token selection. We further introduce a soft pruning technique,\nwhich integrates the less informative tokens generated by the selector module\ninto a package token that will participate in subsequent calculations rather\nthan being completely discarded. Our framework is bound to the trade-off\nbetween accuracy and computation constraints of specific edge devices through\nour proposed computation-aware training strategy. Experimental results show\nthat our framework significantly reduces the computation cost of ViTs while\nmaintaining comparable performance on image classification. Moreover, our\nframework can guarantee the identified model to meet resource specifications of\nmobile devices and FPGA, and even achieve the real-time execution of DeiT-T on\nmobile platforms. For example, our method reduces the latency of DeiT-T to 26\nms (26%$\\sim $41% superior to existing works) on the mobile device with\n0.25%$\\sim $4% higher top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.

    "abstract": "In principle, sparse neural networks should be significantly more efficient\nthan traditional dense networks. Neurons in the brain exhibit two types of\nsparsity; they are sparsely interconnected and sparsely active.

Despite this potential, today's neural networks deliver\nonly modest performance benefits using just weight sparsity, because\ntraditional computing hardware cannot efficiently process sparse networks. In\nthis article we introduce Complementary Sparsity, a novel technique that\nsignificantly improves the performance of dual sparse networks on existing\nhardware. We demonstrate that we can achieve high performance running\nweight-sparse networks, and we can multiply those speedups by incorporating\nactivation sparsity. Using Complementary Sparsity, we show up to 100X\nimprovement in throughput and energy efficiency performing inference on FPGAs.\nWe analyze scalability and resource tradeoffs for a variety of kernels typical\nof commercial convolutional networks such as ResNet-50 and MobileNetV2.

However, depending on the cost of single\nobservations, multi-dimensional optimizations of one or more objectives may\nstill be prohibitively expensive. Multi-fidelity optimization remedies this\nissue by including multiple, cheaper information sources such as low-resolution\napproximations in numerical simulations. Acquisition functions for\nmulti-fidelity optimization are typically based on exploration-heavy algorithms\nthat are difficult to combine with optimization towards multiple objectives.\nHere we show that the expected hypervolume improvement policy can act in many\nsituations as a suitable substitute. We incorporate the evaluation cost either\nvia a two-step evaluation or within a single acquisition function with an\nadditional fidelity-related objective. This permits simultaneous\nmulti-objective and multi-fidelity optimization, which allows to accurately\nestablish the Pareto set and front at fractional cost. Benchmarks show a cost\nreduction of an order of magnitude or more. Our method thus allows for Pareto\noptimization of extremely expansive black-box functions.\nThe presented methods are simple and straightforward to implement in\nexisting, optimized Bayesian optimization frameworks and can immediately be\nextended to batch optimization.

    "abstract": "Unscheduled maintenance has contributed to longer downtime for vehicles and\nincreased costs for Logistic Readiness Squadrons (LRSs) in the Air Force. When\nvehicles are in need of repair outside of their scheduled time, depending on\ntheir priority level, the entire squadron's slated repair schedule is\ntransformed negatively. The repercussions of unscheduled maintenance are\nspecifically seen in the increase of man hours required to maintain vehicles\nthat should have been working well: this can include more man hours spent on\nmaintenance itself, waiting for parts to arrive, hours spent re-organizing the\nrepair schedule, and more. The dominant trend in the current maintenance system\nat LRSs is that they do not have predictive maintenance infrastructure to\ncounteract the influx of unscheduled repairs they experience currently, and as\na result, their readiness and performance levels are lower than desired.\nWe use data pulled from the Defense Property and Accountability System\n(DPAS), that the LRSs currently use to store their vehicle maintenance\ninformation. Using historical vehicle maintenance data we receive from DPAS, we\napply three different algorithms independently to construct an accurate\npredictive system to optimize maintenance schedules at any given time. Through\nthe application of Logistics Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted\nTrees algorithms, we found that a Logistic Regression algorithm, fitted to our\ndata, produced the most accurate results. Our findings indicate that not only\nwould continuing the use of Logistic Regression be prudent for our research\npurposes, but that there is opportunity to further tune and optimize our\nLogistic Regression model for higher accuracy.",

    "abstract": "We explore the locomotion of soft robots in granular medium (GM) resulting\nfrom the elastic deformation of slender rods. A low-cost, rapidly fabricable\nrobot inspired by the physiological structure of bacteria is presented. It\nconsists of a rigid head, with a motor and batteries embedded, and multiple\nelastic rods (our model for flagella) to investigate locomotion in GM. The\nelastic flagella are rotated at one end by the motor, and they deform due to\nthe drag from GM, propelling the robot. The external drag is determined by the\nflagellar shape, while the latter changes due to the competition between\nexternal loading and elastic forces. In this coupled fluid-structure\ninteraction problem, we observe that increasing the number of flagella can\ndecrease or increase the propulsive speed of the robot, depending on the\nphysical parameters of the system. This nonlinearity in the functional relation\nbetween propulsion and the parameters of this simple robot motivates us to\nfundamentally analyze its mechanics using theory, numerical simulation, and\nexperiments. We present a simple Euler-Bernoulli beam theory-based analytical\nframework that is capable of qualitatively capturing both cases. Theoretical\nprediction quantitatively matches experiments when the flagellar deformation is\nsmall. To account for the geometrically nonlinear deformation often encountered\nin soft robots and microbes, we implement a simulation framework that\nincorporates discrete differential geometry-based simulations of elastic rods,\na resistive force theory-based model for drag, and a modified Stokes law for\nthe hydrodynamics of the robot head. Comparison with experimental data\nindicates that the simulations can quantitatively predict robotic motion.\nOverall, the theoretical and numerical tools presented in this paper can shed\nlight on the design and control of this class of articulated robots in granular\nor fluid media.",

The main idea behind\nRELDEC is that an optimized decoding policy is subsequently obtained via\nreinforcement learning based on a Markov decision process (MDP). In contrast to\nour previous work, where an agent learns to schedule only a single check node\n(CN) within a group (cluster) of CNs per iteration, in this work we train the\nagent to schedule all CNs in a cluster, and all clusters in every iteration.\nThat is, in each learning step of RELDEC an agent learns to schedule CN\nclusters sequentially depending on a reward associated with the outcome of\nscheduling a particular cluster. We also modify the state space representation\nof the MDP, enabling RELDEC to be suitable for larger block length LDPC codes\nthan those studied in our previous work. Furthermore, to address decoding under\nvarying channel conditions, we propose two related schemes, namely, agile\nmeta-RELDEC (AM-RELDEC) and meta-RELDEC (M-RELDEC), both of which employ\nmeta-reinforcement learning.

Recently, event-triggered techniques have been\nproposed to reduce the exchanged information among compute nodes and thus\nalleviate the communication cost. However, most existing event-triggered\napproaches only consider heuristic event-triggered thresholds. They also ignore\nthe impact of computation and network delay, which play an important role on\nthe training performance. In this paper, we propose an Asynchronous\nEvent-triggered Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) framework, called AET-SGD, to\ni) reduce the communication cost among the compute nodes, and ii) mitigate the\nimpact of the delay. Compared with baseline event-triggered methods, AET-SGD\nemploys a linear increasing sample size event-triggered threshold, and can\nsignificantly reduce the communication cost while keeping good convergence\nperformance. We implement AET-SGD and evaluate its performance on multiple\nrepresentative data sets, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, KMNIST and CIFAR10.\nThe experimental results validate the correctness of the design and show a\nsignificant communication cost reduction from 44x to 120x, compared to the\nstate of the art.

Nevertheless, prior research in this vein center\naround the centralized learning setting that largely relies on the\ncommunication availability among all the components of a robot. However, agents\nin the real world often operate in a decentralised fashion without\ncommunication due to latency requirements, limited power budgets and safety\nconcerns. By formulating robotic components as a system of decentralised\nagents, this work presents a decentralised multiagent reinforcement learning\nframework for continuous control. To this end, we first develop a cooperative\nmultiagent PPO framework that allows for centralized optimisation during\ntraining and decentralised operation during execution. However, the system only\nreceives a global reward signal which is not attributed towards each agent. To\naddress this challenge, we further propose a generic game-theoretic credit\nassignment framework which computes agent-specific reward signals. Last but not\nleast, we also incorporate a model-based RL module into our credit assignment\nframework, which leads to significant improvement in sample efficiency.

    "abstract": "Despite the success of mixup in data augmentation, its applicability to\nnatural language processing (NLP) tasks has been limited due to the discrete\nand variable-length nature of natural languages. Recent studies have thus\nrelied on domain-specific heuristics and manually crafted resources, such as\ndictionaries, in order to apply mixup in NLP. In this paper, we instead propose\nan unsupervised learning approach to text interpolation for the purpose of data\naugmentation, to which we refer as \"Learning to INterpolate for Data\nAugmentation\" (LINDA), that does not require any heuristics nor manually\ncrafted resources but learns to interpolate between any pair of natural\nlanguage sentences over a natural language manifold. After empirically\ndemonstrating the LINDA's interpolation capability, we show that LINDA indeed\nallows us to seamlessly apply mixup in NLP and leads to better generalization\nin text classification both in-domain and out-of-domain.",

    "abstract": "Quantization for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has shown significant\nprogress with the intention of reducing the cost of computation and storage\nwith low-bitwidth data inputs. There are, however, no systematic studies on how\nan existing full-bitwidth processing unit, such as CPUs and DSPs, can be better\nutilized to carry out significantly higher computation throughput for\nconvolution under various quantized bitwidths. In this study, we propose\nHiKonv, a unified solution that maximizes the compute throughput of a given\nunderlying processing unit to process low-bitwidth quantized data inputs\nthrough novel bit-wise parallel computation. We establish theoretical\nperformance bounds using a full-bitwidth multiplier for highly parallelized\nlow-bitwidth convolution, and demonstrate new breakthroughs for\nhigh-performance computing in this critical domain. For example, a single\n32-bit processing unit can deliver 128 binarized convolution operations\n(multiplications and additions) under one CPU instruction, and a single 27x18\nDSP core can deliver eight convolution operations with 4-bit inputs in one\ncycle. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HiKonv on CPU and FPGA for both\nconvolutional layers or a complete DNN model. For a convolutional layer\nquantized to 4-bit, HiKonv achieves a 3.17x latency improvement over the\nbaseline implementation using C++ on CPU.

    "abstract": "Solar energy is now the cheapest form of electricity in history.\nUnfortunately, significantly increasing the grid's fraction of solar energy\nremains challenging due to its variability, which makes balancing electricity's\nsupply and demand more difficult. While thermal generators' ramp rate -- the\nmaximum rate that they can change their output -- is finite, solar's ramp rate\nis essentially infinite. Thus, accurate near-term solar forecasting, or\nnowcasting, is important to provide advance warning to adjust thermal generator\noutput in response to solar variations to ensure a balanced supply and demand.\nTo address the problem, this paper develops a general model for solar\nnowcasting from abundant and readily available multispectral satellite data\nusing self-supervised learning. Specifically, we develop deep auto-regressive\nmodels using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory\nnetworks (LSTM) that are globally trained across multiple locations to predict\nraw future observations of the spatio-temporal data collected by the recently\nlaunched GOES-R series of satellites. Our model estimates a location's future\nsolar irradiance based on satellite observations, which we feed to a regression\nmodel trained on smaller site-specific solar data to provide near-term solar\nphotovoltaic (PV) forecasts that account for site-specific characteristics. We\nevaluate our approach for different coverage areas and forecast horizons across\n25 solar sites and show that our approach yields errors close to that of a\nmodel using ground-truth observations.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of facial forgery techniques, forgery detection\nhas attracted more and more attention due to security concerns. Existing\napproaches attempt to use frequency information to mine subtle artifacts under\nhigh-quality forged faces. However, the exploitation of frequency information\nis coarse-grained, and more importantly, their vanilla learning process\nstruggles to extract fine-grained forgery traces. To address this issue, we\npropose a progressive enhancement learning framework to exploit both the RGB\nand fine-grained frequency clues. Specifically, we perform a fine-grained\ndecomposition of RGB images to completely decouple the real and fake traces in\nthe frequency space. Subsequently, we propose a progressive enhancement\nlearning framework based on a two-branch network, combined with\nself-enhancement and mutual-enhancement modules. The self-enhancement module\ncaptures the traces in different input spaces based on spatial noise\nenhancement and channel attention. The Mutual-enhancement module concurrently\nenhances RGB and frequency features by communicating in the shared spatial\ndimension. The progressive enhancement process facilitates the learning of\ndiscriminative features with fine-grained face forgery clues.

The key challenge lies in\nfinding effective ways to exploit the spatio-temporal context of past frames to\nhelp learn discriminative target representation of current frame. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Siamese network with a specifically designed\ninteractive transformer, called SITVOS, to enable effective context propagation\nfrom historical to current frames. Technically, we use the transformer encoder\nand decoder to handle the past frames and current frame separately, i.e., the\nencoder encodes robust spatio-temporal context of target object from the past\nframes, while the decoder takes the feature embedding of current frame as the\nquery to retrieve the target from the encoder output. To further enhance the\ntarget representation, a feature interaction module (FIM) is devised to promote\nthe information flow between the encoder and decoder. Moreover, we employ the\nSiamese architecture to extract backbone features of both past and current\nframes, which enables feature reuse and is more efficient than existing\nmethods. Experimental results on three challenging benchmarks validate the\nsuperiority of SITVOS over state-of-the-art methods.",

Here, our first\ncontribution is the first adequately large realistic image dataset\n\\textit{AIWeeds} (one/multiple kinds of weeds in one image), a library of about\n10,000 annotated images of flax, and the 14 most common weeds in fields and\ngardens taken from 20 different locations in North Dakota, California, and\nCentral China. Second, we provide a full pipeline from model training with\nmaximum efficiency to deploying the TensorRT-optimized model onto a single\nboard computer.

However, our study on all 922 weaknesses in the CWE and\n156,537 vulnerabilities registered in the CVE to date has found a very small\ncoverage of privacy-related vulnerabilities in both systems, only 4.45\\% in CWE\nand 0.1\\% in CVE. These also cover only a small number of areas of privacy\nthreats that have been raised in existing privacy software engineering\nresearch, privacy regulations and frameworks, and industry sources. The\nactionable insights generated from our study led to the introduction of 11 new\ncommon privacy weaknesses to supplement the CWE system, making it become a\nsource for both security and privacy vulnerabilities.",

    "title": "Pale Transformer: A General Vision Transformer Backbone with Pale-Shaped  Attention",
    "abstract": "Recently, Transformers have shown promising performance in various vision\ntasks. To reduce the quadratic computation complexity caused by the global\nself-attention, various methods constrain the range of attention within a local\nregion to improve its efficiency. Consequently, their receptive fields in a\nsingle attention layer are not large enough, resulting in insufficient context\nmodeling. To address this issue, we propose a Pale-Shaped self-Attention\n(PS-Attention), which performs self-attention within a pale-shaped region.\nCompared to the global self-attention, PS-Attention can reduce the computation\nand memory costs significantly. Meanwhile, it can capture richer contextual\ninformation under the similar computation complexity with previous local\nself-attention mechanisms. Based on the PS-Attention, we develop a general\nVision Transformer backbone with a hierarchical architecture, named Pale\nTransformer, which achieves 83.4%, 84.3%, and 84.9% Top-1 accuracy with the\nmodel size of 22M, 48M, and 85M respectively for 224 ImageNet-1K\nclassification, outperforming the previous Vision Transformer backbones. For\ndownstream tasks, our Pale Transformer backbone performs better than the recent\nstate-of-the-art CSWin Transformer by a large margin on ADE20K semantic\nsegmentation and COCO object detection & instance segmentation. The code will\nbe released on https://github.com/BR-IDL/PaddleViT.",

In this paper, we\npropose a multi-band Wi-Fi fusion method for Wi-Fi sensing that hierarchically\nfuses the features from both the fine-grained CSI at sub-6 GHz and the\nmid-grained beam SNR at 60 GHz in a granularity matching framework. The\ngranularity matching is realized by pairing two feature maps from the CSI and\nbeam SNR at different granularity levels and linearly combining all paired\nfeature maps into a fused feature map with learnable weights.\nTo further address the issue of limited labeled training data, we propose an\nautoencoder-based multi-band Wi-Fi fusion network that can be pre-trained in an\nunsupervised fashion. Once the autoencoder-based fusion network is pre-trained,\nwe detach the decoders and append multi-task sensing heads to the fused feature\nmap by fine-tuning the fusion block and re-training the multi-task heads from\nthe scratch.

    "abstract": "Application virtual memory footprints are growing rapidly in all systems from\nservers to smartphones. To address this growing demand, system integrators are\nincorporating larger amounts of main memory, warranting rethinking of memory\nmanagement. In current systems, applications produce page faults whenever they\naccess virtual memory regions that are not backed by a physical page. As\napplication memory footprints grow, they induce more and more minor pagefaults.\nHandling of each minor page fault can take few 1000's of CPU-cycles and blocks\nthe application till OS kernel finds a free physical frame. These page faults\ncan be detrimental to the performance when their frequency of occurrence is\nhigh and spread across application run-time. Our evaluation of several\nworkloads indicates an overhead due to minor page faults as high as 29% of\nexecution time. In this paper, we propose to mitigate this problem through a\nHW/SW co-design approach. Specifically, we first propose to parallelize\nportions of the kernel page allocation to run ahead of fault time in a separate\nthread. Then we propose the Minor Fault Offload Engine(MFOE), a per-core HW\naccelerator for minor fault handling. MFOE is equipped with pre-allocated frame\ntable that it uses to service a page fault. On a page fault, MFOE quickly picks\na pre-allocated page frame from this table, makes an entry for it in the TLB,\nand updates the page table entry to satisfy the page fault. The pre-allocation\nframe tables are periodically refreshed by a background thread, which also\nupdates the data structures in the kernel to account for the handled page\nfaults. We evaluate this system in the gem5 simulator with a modified Linux\nkernel running on top of simulated hardware. Our results show that MFOE\nimproves the critical-path fault handling latency by 37x and improves the\nrun-time amongst the evaluated applications, by an average of 7.5%",

In many practical applications, the base station (BS) only concerns the\nlist of received messages instead of the source information, introducing the\nemerging concept of unsourced random access (URA). Although some massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) URA schemes have been proposed recently,\nthe unique propagation properties of millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive MIMO\nsystems are not fully exploited in conventional URA schemes. In grant-free\nrandom access, the BS cannot perform receive beamforming independently as the\nidentities of active users are unknown to the BS. Therefore, only the intrinsic\nbeam division property can be exploited to improve the decoding performance. In\nthis paper, a URA scheme based on beam-space tree decoding is proposed for\nmmWave massive MIMO system. Specifically, two beam-space tree decoders are\ndesigned based on hard decision and soft decision, respectively, to utilize the\nbeam division property. They both leverage the beam division property to assist\nin discriminating the sub-blocks transmitted from different users. Besides, the\nfirst decoder can reduce the searching space, enjoying a low complexity. The\nsecond decoder exploits the advantage of list decoding to recover the\nmiss-detected packets.

    "title": "DAS: A deep adaptive sampling method for solving partial differential  equations",
    "abstract": "In this work we propose a deep adaptive sampling (DAS) method for solving\npartial differential equations (PDEs), where deep neural networks are utilized\nto approximate the solutions of PDEs and deep generative models are employed to\ngenerate new collocation points that refine the training set. The overall\nprocedure of DAS consists of two components: solving the PDEs by minimizing the\nresidual loss on the collocation points in the training set and generating a\nnew training set to further improve the accuracy of current approximate\nsolution. In particular, we treat the residual as a probability density\nfunction and approximate it with a deep generative model, called KRnet. The new\nsamples from KRnet are consistent with the distribution induced by the\nresidual, i.e., more samples are located in the region of large residual and\nless samples are located in the region of small residual. Analogous to\nclassical adaptive methods such as the adaptive finite element, KRnet acts as\nan error indicator that guides the refinement of the training set. Compared to\nthe neural network approximation obtained with uniformly distributed\ncollocation points, the developed algorithms can significantly improve the\naccuracy, especially for low regularity and high-dimensional problems. We\npresent a theoretical analysis to show that the proposed DAS method can reduce\nthe error bound and demonstrate its effectiveness with numerical experiments.",

Our two primary novelties are a notion of intrinsic\napartness and a notion of sharp elements. Being apart is a positive formulation\nof being unequal, similar to how inhabitedness is a positive formulation of\nnonemptiness. To exemplify sharpness, we note that a lower real is sharp if and\nonly if it is located. Our first main result is that for a large class of\ncontinuous dcpos, the Bridges-Vita apartness topology and the Scott topology\ncoincide. Although we cannot expect a tight or cotransitive apartness on\nnontrivial dcpos, we prove that the intrinsic apartness is both tight and\ncotransitive when restricted to the sharp elements of a continuous dcpo.

This type\ntheory can be used as a metalanguage for synthetic guarded domain theory in\nwhich one can solve guarded recursive type equations, also with negative\nvariable occurrences, and use these to construct models for reasoning about\nprogramming languages. Combining this with HITs allows for the use of type\nconstructors familiar from set-theory based approaches to semantics, such as\nquotients and finite powersets in these models.\nIn this paper we show how to reason about the combination of finite\nnon-determinism and recursion in this type theory. Unlike traditional domain\ntheory which takes an ordering of programs as primitive, synthetic guarded\ndomain theory takes the notion of computation step as primitive in the form of\na modal operator. We use this extra intensional information to define two\nguarded recursive (finite) powerdomain constructions differing in the way\nnon-determinism interacts with the computation steps. As an example application\nof these we show how to prove applicative similarity a congruence in the cases\nof may- and must-convergence for the untyped lambda calculus with finite\nnon-determinism.

This connectivity reduction in rIGA's algebraic system results in\nfaster matrix LU factorizations when using multifrontal direct solvers. We\ncompare computational costs of rIGA versus those of IGA when employing Krylov\neigensolvers to solve quadratic eigenproblems arising in 2D vector-valued\nmultifield problems. For large problem sizes, the eigencomputation cost is\ngoverned by the cost of LU factorization, followed by costs of several\nmatrix-vector and vector-vector multiplications, which correspond to Krylov\nprojections. We minimize the computational cost by introducing C^0 and C^1\nseparators at specific element interfaces for our rIGA generalizations of the\ncurl-conforming Nedelec and divergence-conforming Raviart-Thomas finite\nelements. Let p be the polynomial degree of basis functions; the LU\nfactorization is up to O((p-1)^2) times faster when using rIGA compared to IGA\nin the asymptotic regime. Thus, rIGA theoretically improves the total\neigencomputation cost by O((p-1)^2) for sufficiently large problem sizes. Yet,\nin practical cases of moderate-size eigenproblems, the improvement rate\ndeteriorates as the number of computed eigenvalues increases because of\nmultiple matrix-vector and vector-vector operations.

The purpose of the agents is to recognize\nobjects and other semantic classes in the whole building at the end of a\nprocess that combines exploration and active visual learning. As we study this\ntask in a lifelong learning context, the agents should use knowledge gained in\nearlier visited environments in order to guide their exploration and active\nlearning strategy in successively visited buildings. We use the semantic\nsegmentation performance as a proxy for general visual perception and study\nthis novel task for several exploration and annotation methods, ranging from\nfrontier exploration baselines which use heuristic active learning, to a fully\nlearnable approach. For the latter, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning\n(RL) based agent which jointly learns both navigation and active learning. A\npoint goal navigation formulation, coupled with a global planner which supplies\ngoals, is integrated into the RL model in order to provide further incentives\nfor systematic exploration of novel scenes. By performing extensive experiments\non the Matterport3D dataset, we show how the proposed agents can utilize\nknowledge from previously explored scenes when exploring new ones, e.g. through\nless granular exploration and less frequent requests for annotations.

While interacting with objects, tactile sensing provides useful\ninformation for the robot to understand the object, such as distributed\npressure, temperature, vibrations and texture. During robot grasping, vision is\noften occluded by its end-effectors, whereas tactile sensing can measure areas\nthat are not accessible by vision. In the past decades, a number of tactile\nsensors have been developed for robots and used for different robotic tasks. In\nthis chapter, we focus on the use of tactile sensing for robotic grasping and\ninvestigate the recent trends in tactile perception of object properties. We\nfirst discuss works on tactile perception of three important object properties\nin grasping, i.e., shape, pose and material properties. We then review the\nrecent development in grasping stability prediction with tactile sensing. Among\nthese works, we identify the requirement for coordinating vision and tactile\nsensing in the robotic grasping. To demonstrate the use of tactile sensing to\nimprove the visual perception, our recent development of vision-guided tactile\nperception for crack reconstruction is presented. In the proposed framework,\nthe large receptive field of camera vision is first leveraged to achieve a\nquick search of candidate regions containing cracks, a high-resolution optical\ntactile sensor is then used to examine these candidate regions and reconstruct\na refined crack shape. The experiments show that our proposed method can\nachieve a significant reduction of mean distance error from 0.82 mm to 0.24 mm\nfor crack reconstruction.

In a celebrated version of the relay-assisted\nprotocol, as applied by Lai et al., Zhou et al., Wang et al. and Waqas et al.,\nthe relay node generates pair-wise keys with the two nodes, and then broadcasts\nan XOR version of the two keys. Although such protocols are simple and\neffective, we observe that they face reduction in key rates due to two\nproblems. First, for confidentiality, the relay broadcasts an XOR function of\nthe pair-wise keys thereby pruning the length of the shared key to be the\nminimum of the key lengths of the pair-wise keys. Secondly, the broadcast phase\nmay also experience outages thereby not being able to share the generated key\nin every round of the protocol. Identifying these issues, we propose a\nbuffer-aided relaying protocol wherein buffer is used at the relay to store\nunused secret bits generated in the previous rounds of the protocol so as to\nprovide confidentiality in the subsequent rounds of broadcast. On this\nbuffer-aided protocol, we propose a power-allocation strategy between the\nphases of key generation and broadcast so as to maximize the throughput and key\nrate.

The existing\nliterature has mainly considered IRS being deployed near user terminals to\nimprove their performance. However, this approach may incur a high cost if IRSs\nneed to be densely deployed in the network to cater to random user locations.\nTo avoid such high deployment cost, in this paper we consider a new IRS aided\nwireless network architecture, where IRSs are deployed in the vicinity of each\nbase station (BS) to assist in its communications with distributed users\nregardless of their locations. Besides significantly enhancing IRSs' signal\ncoverage, this scheme helps reduce the IRS associated channel estimation\noverhead as compared to conventional user-side IRSs, by exploiting the nearly\nstatic BS-IRS channels over short distance. For this scheme, we propose a new\ntwo stage transmission protocol to achieve IRS channel estimation and\nreflection optimization for uplink data transmission efficiently. In addition,\nwe propose effective methods for solving the user IRS association problem based\non long term channel knowledge and the selected user IRS BS cascaded channel\nestimation problem. Finally, all IRSs' passive reflections are jointly\noptimized with the BS's multi-antenna receive combining to maximize the minimum\nachievable rate among all users for data transmission. Numerical results show\nthat the proposed co site IRS empowered BS scheme can achieve significant\nperformance gains over the conventional BS without co site IRS and existing\nschemes for IRS channel estimation and reflection optimization, thus enabling\nan appealing low cost and high performance BS design for future wireless\nnetworks.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we are interested to an inverse Cauchy problem governed by the\nStokes equation, called the data completion problem. It consists in determining\nthe unspecified fluid velocity, or one of its components over a part of its\nboundary, by introducing given measurements on its remaining part. As it's\nknown, this problem is one of the highly ill-posed problems in the Hadamard's\nsense \\cite{had}, it is then an interesting challenge to carry out a numerical\nprocedure for approximating their solutions, mostly in the particular case of\nnoisy data. To solve this problem, we propose here a regularizing approach\nbased on a coupled complex boundary method, originally proposed in\n\\cite{source}, for solving an inverse source problem. We show the existence of\nthe regularization optimization problem and prove the convergence of the\nsubsequence of optimal solutions of Tikhonov regularization formulations to the\nsolution of the Cauchy problem. Then we suggest the numerical approximation of\nthis problem using the adjoint gradient technic and the finite element method\nof $P1-bubble/P1$ type.

The control architecture uses\nthe patient's propofol pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model, using the\ncalculated results as a feedback signal to correct the model's uncertainties.\nDuring anesthesia, the bispectral index (BIS) level is used as a control\nvariable to control the depth of anesthesia. The proposed control architecture\ncan automatically adjust the infusion rate of anesthesia drugs without\nconcussion or overshoot. The system adaptively adjusts the drug infusion rate\nto maintain the BIS level at a stable target value. We utilized MATLAB-Simulink\nto verify the effectiveness of this method, and the robustness test was carried\nout by adding noise blocks. At last, we analyze the simulation result of the\naverage patient.

    "abstract": "The innate capacity of humans and other animals to learn a diverse, and often\ninterfering, range of knowledge and skills throughout their lifespan is a\nhallmark of natural intelligence, with obvious evolutionary motivations. In\nparallel, the ability of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to learn across a\nrange of tasks and domains, combining and re-using learned representations\nwhere required, is a clear goal of artificial intelligence. This capacity,\nwidely described as continual learning, has become a prolific subfield of\nresearch in machine learning. Despite the numerous successes of deep learning\nin recent years, across domains ranging from image recognition to machine\ntranslation, such continual task learning has proved challenging. Neural\nnetworks trained on multiple tasks in sequence with stochastic gradient descent\noften suffer from representational interference, whereby the learned weights\nfor a given task effectively overwrite those of previous tasks in a process\ntermed catastrophic forgetting. This represents a major impediment to the\ndevelopment of more generalised artificial learning systems, capable of\naccumulating knowledge over time and task space, in a manner analogous to\nhumans.

    "abstract": "Mutation testing research has indicated that a major part of its application\ncost is due to the large number of low utility mutants that it introduces.\nAlthough previous research has identified this issue, no previous study has\nproposed any effective solution to the problem. Thus, it remains unclear how to\nmutate and test a given piece of code in a best effort way, i.e., achieving a\ngood trade-off between invested effort and test effectiveness. To achieve this,\nwe propose Cerebro, a machine learning approach that statically selects\nsubsuming mutants, i.e., the set of mutants that resides on the top of the\nsubsumption hierarchy, based on the mutants' surrounding code context. We\nevaluate Cerebro using 48 and 10 programs written in C and Java, respectively,\nand demonstrate that it preserves the mutation testing benefits while limiting\napplication cost, i.e., reduces all cost application factors such as equivalent\nmutants, mutant executions, and the mutants requiring analysis. We demonstrate\nthat Cerebro has strong inter-project prediction ability, which is\nsignificantly higher than two baseline methods, i.e., supervised learning on\nfeatures proposed by state-of-the-art, and random mutant selection. More\nimportantly, our results show that Cerebro's selected mutants lead to strong\ntests that are respectively capable of killing 2 times higher than the number\nof subsuming mutants killed by the baselines when selecting the same number of\nmutants. At the same time, Cerebro reduces the cost-related factors, as it\nselects, on average, 68% fewer equivalent mutants, while requiring 90% fewer\ntest executions than the baselines.",

Skin feature tracking enables\nvideo-based quantification of motor degradation in Parkinson's disease.\nTraditional computer vision algorithms include Scale Invariant Feature\nTransform (SIFT), Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), and Lucas-Kanade method\n(LK). These have long represented the state-of-the-art in efficiency and\naccuracy but fail when common deformations, like affine local transformations\nor illumination changes, are present.\nOver the past five years, deep convolutional neural networks have\noutperformed traditional methods for most computer vision tasks.

The autoencoder learns to represent image crops into\ndeep feature encodings specific to the object category it is trained on.\nWe train the autoencoder on facial images and validate its ability to track\nskin features in general using manually labeled face and hand videos.

To facilitate this automation, a bug report has to be\neffectively matched with source code changes, even when a significant lexical\ngap exists between natural language used to describe the bug and identifier\nnaming practices used by developers. To bridge this gap, we need techniques\nthat are able to capture software engineering-specific and project-specific\nsemantics in order to detect relatedness between the two types of documents\nthat goes beyond exact term matching. Popular transformer-based deep learning\narchitectures, such as BERT, excel at leveraging contextual information, hence\nappear to be a suitable candidate for the task.

We also explore several design decisions in using BERT for this\npurpose, including how best to encode changesets and how to match bug reports\nto individual changes for improved accuracy. We compare the accuracy and\nperformance of our model to a non-contextual baseline (i.e., vector space\nmodel) and BERT-based architectures previously used in software engineering.\nOur evaluation results demonstrate advantages in using the proposed BERT model\ncompared to the baselines, especially for bug reports that lack any hints about\nrelated code elements.",

    "abstract": "Stencil computation is one of the most used kernels in a wide variety of\nscientific applications, ranging from large-scale weather prediction to solving\npartial differential equations. Stencil computations are characterized by three\nunique properties: (1) low arithmetic intensity, (2) limited temporal data\nreuse, and (3) regular and predictable data access pattern. As a result,\nstencil computations are typically bandwidth-bound workloads, which only\nexperience limited benefits from the deep cache hierarchy of modern CPUs. In\nthis work, we propose Casper, a near-cache accelerator consisting of\nspecialized stencil compute units connected to the last-level cache (LLC) of a\ntraditional CPU. Casper is based on two key ideas: (1) avoiding the cost of\nmoving rarely reused data through the cache hierarchy, and (2) exploiting the\nregularity of the data accesses and the inherent parallelism of the stencil\ncomputation to increase the overall performance.\nWith minimal changes in LLC address decoding logic and data placement, Casper\nperforms stencil computations at the peak bandwidth of the LLC. We show that,\nby tightly coupling lightweight stencil compute units near to LLC, Casper\nimproves the performance of stencil kernels by 1.65x on average, while reducing\nthe energy consumption by 35% compared to a commercial high-performance\nmulti-core processor. Moreover, Casper provides a 37x improvement in\nperformance-per-area compared to a state-of-the-art GPU.",

Thus it becomes much harder to\ncollect real data for ReID task. Meanwhile, the labor cost of labeling ReID\ndata is still very high and further hinders the development of the ReID\nresearch. Therefore, many methods turn to generate synthetic images for ReID\nalgorithms as alternatives instead of real images. However, there is an\ninevitable domain gap between synthetic and real images. In previous methods,\nthe generation process is based on virtual scenes, and their synthetic training\ndata can not be changed according to different target real scenes\nautomatically. To handle this problem, we propose a novel Target-Aware\nGeneration pipeline to produce synthetic person images, called TAGPerson.\nSpecifically, it involves a parameterized rendering method, where the\nparameters are controllable and can be adjusted according to target scenes. In\nTAGPerson, we extract information from target scenes and use them to control\nour parameterized rendering process to generate target-aware synthetic images,\nwhich would hold a smaller gap to the real images in the target domain. In our\nexperiments, our target-aware synthetic images can achieve a much higher\nperformance than the generalized synthetic images on MSMT17, i.e. 47.5% vs.\n40.9% for rank-1 accuracy.

    "abstract": "Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) systems have become a fixture in urban\ntransportation networks, with the rapid growth of ride-hailing services such as\nUber and Lyft. Ride-hailing is typically complemented with ridepooling options,\nwhich can reduce the negative externalities associated with ride-hailing\nservices and increase the utilization of vehicles. Determining optimal policies\nfor vehicle dispatching and pricing, two key components that enable MoD\nservices, are challenging due to their massive scale and online nature. The\nchallenge is amplified when the MoD platform offers exclusive (conventional\nride-hailing) and shared services, and customers have the option to select\nbetween them. The pricing and dispatching problems are coupled because the\nrealized demand depends on the quality of service (i.e., whom to share rides\nwith) and the prices for each service type. We propose an integrated and\ncomputationally efficient method for solving the joint pricing and dispatching\nproblem -- both when the problem is solved one request at a time or in batches\n(a common strategy in the industry). The main results of this research include\nshowing that: (i) the sequential pricing problem has a closed-form solution\nunder a multinomial logit (MNL) choice model, and (ii) the batched pricing\nproblem is jointly concave in the expected demand distributions. To account for\nthe spatial evolution of supply and demand, we introduce so-called\nretrospective costs to retain a tractable framework. Our numerical experiments\ndemonstrate how this framework yields significant profit increases using\ntaxicab data in Manhattan, New York City, compared to dynamic dispatching with\nstatic pricing policies.",

    "abstract": "Humans usually perceive the world in a multimodal way that vision, touch,\nsound are utilised to understand surroundings from various dimensions. These\nsenses are combined together to achieve a synergistic effect where the learning\nis more effectively than using each sense separately. For robotics, vision and\ntouch are two key senses for the dexterous manipulation. Vision usually gives\nus apparent features like shape, color, and the touch provides local\ninformation such as friction, texture, etc. Due to the complementary properties\nbetween visual and tactile senses, it is desirable for us to combine vision and\ntouch for a synergistic perception and manipulation. Many researches have been\ninvestigated about multimodal perception such as cross-modal learning, 3D\nreconstruction, multimodal translation with vision and touch. Specifically, we\npropose a cross-modal sensory data generation framework for the translation\nbetween vision and touch, which is able to generate realistic pseudo data. By\nusing this cross-modal translation method, it is desirable for us to make up\ninaccessible data, helping us to learn the object's properties from different\nviews. Recently, the attention mechanism becomes a popular method either in\nvisual perception or in tactile perception. We propose a spatio-temporal\nattention model for tactile texture recognition, which takes both spatial\nfeatures and time dimension into consideration. Our proposed method not only\npays attention to the salient features in each spatial feature, but also models\nthe temporal correlation in the through the time. The obvious improvement\nproves the efficiency of our selective attention mechanism.

    "title": "DeepAdversaries: Examining the Robustness of Deep Learning Models for  Galaxy Morphology Classification",
    "abstract": "Data processing and analysis pipelines in cosmological survey experiments\nintroduce data perturbations that can significantly degrade the performance of\ndeep learning-based models. Given the increased adoption of supervised deep\nlearning methods for processing and analysis of cosmological survey data, the\nassessment of data perturbation effects and the development of methods that\nincrease model robustness are increasingly important. In the context of\nmorphological classification of galaxies, we study the effects of perturbations\nin imaging data. In particular, we examine the consequences of using neural\nnetworks when training on baseline data and testing on perturbed data. We\nconsider perturbations associated with two primary sources: 1) increased\nobservational noise as represented by higher levels of Poisson noise and 2)\ndata processing noise incurred by steps such as image compression or telescope\nerrors as represented by one-pixel adversarial attacks. We also test the\nefficacy of domain adaptation techniques in mitigating the perturbation-driven\nerrors. We use classification accuracy, latent space visualizations, and latent\nspace distance to assess model robustness. Without domain adaptation, we find\nthat processing pixel-level errors easily flip the classification into an\nincorrect class and that higher observational noise makes the model trained on\nlow-noise data unable to classify galaxy morphologies. On the other hand, we\nshow that training with domain adaptation improves model robustness and\nmitigates the effects of these perturbations, improving the classification\naccuracy by 23% on data with higher observational noise. Domain adaptation also\nincreases by a factor of ~2.3 the latent space distance between the baseline\nand the incorrectly classified one-pixel perturbed image, making the model more\nrobust to inadvertent perturbations.",

In this paper, we introduce a\ntime-incremental learning framework: given a dataset of labeled signal traces\nwith a common time horizon, we propose a method to predict the label of a\nsignal that is received incrementally over time, referred to as prefix signal.\nPrefix signals are the signals that are being observed as they are generated,\nand their time length is shorter than the common horizon of signals. We present\na novel decision-tree based approach to generate a finite number of Signal\nTemporal Logic (STL) specifications from the given dataset, and construct a\npredictor based on them. Each STL specification, as a binary classifier of\ntime-series data, captures the temporal properties of the dataset over time.\nThe predictor is constructed by assigning time-variant weights to the STL\nformulas. The weights are learned by using neural networks, with the goal of\nminimizing the misclassification rate for the prefix signals defined over the\ngiven dataset. The learned predictor is used to predict the label of a prefix\nsignal, by computing the weighted sum of the robustness of the prefix signal\nwith respect to each STL formula.

    "abstract": "Increasingly stringent throughput and latency requirements in datacenter\nnetworks demand fast and accurate congestion control. We observe that the\nreaction time and accuracy of existing datacenter congestion control schemes\nare inherently limited. They either rely only on explicit feedback about the\nnetwork state (e.g., queue lengths in DCTCP) or only on variations of state\n(e.g., RTT gradient in TIMELY). To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nnovel congestion control algorithm, PowerTCP, which achieves much more\nfine-grained congestion control by adapting to the bandwidth-window product\n(henceforth called power). PowerTCP leverages in-band network telemetry to\nreact to changes in the network instantaneously without loss of throughput and\nwhile keeping queues short. Due to its fast reaction time, our algorithm is\nparticularly well-suited for dynamic network environments and bursty traffic\npatterns. We show analytically and empirically that PowerTCP can significantly\noutperform the state-of-the-art in both traditional datacenter topologies and\nemerging reconfigurable datacenters where frequent bandwidth changes make\ncongestion control challenging. In traditional datacenter networks, PowerTCP\nreduces tail flow completion times of short flows by 80% compared to DCQCN and\nTIMELY, and by 33% compared to HPCC even at 60% network load.

The\ninteraction effect between model type and sparsity was significant (F(9)=59.20;\np < 0.01), indicating the success of DNNs can partly be attributed to their\nrobustness and ability to model hierarchical relationships between\nhealth-related factors.

    "abstract": "When medical researchers conduct a systematic review (SR), screening studies\nis the most time-consuming process: researchers read several thousands of\nmedical literature and manually label them relevant or irrelevant. Screening\nprioritization (ie., document ranking) is an approach for assisting researchers\nby providing document rankings where relevant documents are ranked higher than\nirrelevant ones. Seed-driven document ranking (SDR) uses a known relevant\ndocument (ie., seed) as a query and generates such rankings. Previous work on\nSDR seeks ways to identify different term weights in a query document and\nutilizes them in a retrieval model to compute ranking scores. Alternatively, we\nformulate the SDR task as finding similar documents to a query document and\nproduce rankings based on similarity scores. We propose a document matching\nmeasure named Mirror Matching, which calculates matching scores between medical\nabstract texts by incorporating common writing patterns, such as background,\nmethod, result, and conclusion in order. We conduct experiments on CLEF 2019\neHealth Task 2 TAR dataset, and the empirical results show this simple approach\nachieves the higher performance than traditional and neural retrieval models on\nAverage Precision and Precision-focused metrics.",

In these techniques, the random field is decomposed to a set of\ndeterministic TDBs and time-dependent stochastic coefficients. When applied to\nSPDEs with non-homogeneous stochastic boundary conditions (BCs), appropriate BC\nmust be specified for each of the TDBs. However, determining BCs for TDB is not\ntrivial because: (i) the dimension of the random BCs is different than the rank\nof the TDB subspace; (ii) TDB in most formulations must preserve orthonormality\nor orthogonality constraints and specifying BCs for TDB should not violate\nthese constraints in the space-discretized form. In this work, we present a\nmethodology for determining the boundary conditions for TDBs at no additional\ncomputational cost beyond that of solving the same SPDE with homogeneous BCs.\nOur methodology is informed by the fact the TDB evolution equations are the\noptimality conditions of a variational principle. We leverage the same\nvariational principle to derive an evolution equation for the value of TDB at\nthe boundaries. The presented methodology preserves the orthonormality or\northogonality constraints of TDBs.

    "abstract": "Airports have been constantly evolving and adopting digital technologies to\nimprove operational efficiency, enhance passenger experience, generate\nancillary revenues and boost capacity from existing infrastructure. The\nCOVID-19 pandemic has also challenged airports and aviation stakeholders alike\nto adapt and manage new operational challenges such as facilitating a\ncontactless travel experience and ensuring business continuity. Digitalisation\nusing Industry 4.0 technologies offers opportunities for airports to address\nshort-term challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic while also\npreparing for future long-term challenges that ensue the crisis. Through a\nsystematic literature review of 102 relevant articles, we discuss the current\nstate of adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies in airports, the associated\nchallenges as well as future research directions. The results of this review\nsuggest that the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies is slowly gaining\ntraction within the airport environment, and shall continue to remain relevant\nin the digital transformation journeys in developing future airports.",

    "abstract": "Multi-arm bandit (MAB) is a classic online learning framework that studies\nthe sequential decision-making in an uncertain environment. The MAB framework,\nhowever, overlooks the scenario where the decision-maker cannot take actions\n(e.g., pulling arms) directly. It is a practically important scenario in many\napplications such as spectrum sharing, crowdsensing, and edge computing. In\nthese applications, the decision-maker would incentivize other selfish agents\nto carry out desired actions (i.e., pulling arms on the decision-maker's\nbehalf). This paper establishes the incentivized online learning (IOL)\nframework for this scenario. The key challenge to design the IOL framework lies\nin the tight coupling of the unknown environment learning and asymmetric\ninformation revelation. To address this, we construct a special Lagrangian\nfunction based on which we propose a socially-optimal mechanism for the IOL\nframework. Our mechanism satisfies various desirable properties such as agent\nfairness, incentive compatibility, and voluntary participation. It achieves the\nsame asymptotic performance as the state-of-art benchmark that requires extra\ninformation. Our analysis also unveils the power of crowd in the IOL framework:\na larger agent crowd enables our mechanism to approach more closely the\ntheoretical upper bound of social performance. Numerical results demonstrate\nthe advantages of our mechanism in large-scale edge computing.",

Several models have been developed to detect fake\nreviews using machine learning approaches. Many of these models have some\nlimitations resulting in low accuracy in distinguishing between fake and\ngenuine reviews. These models focused only on linguistic features to detect\nfake reviews and failed to capture the semantic meaning of the reviews. To deal\nwith this, this paper proposes a new ensemble model that employs transformer\narchitecture to discover the hidden patterns in a sequence of fake reviews and\ndetect them precisely. The proposed approach combines three transformer models\nto improve the robustness of fake and genuine behaviour profiling and modelling\nto detect fake reviews.

In this paper, we\novercome this limitation by proposing a novel approach for rare disease\nprediction based on federated meta-learning. To improve the prediction accuracy\nof rare diseases, we design an attention-based meta-learning (ATML) approach\nwhich dynamically adjusts the attention to different tasks according to the\nmeasured training effect of base learners. Additionally, a dynamic-weight based\nfusion strategy is proposed to further improve the accuracy of federated\nlearning, which dynamically selects clients based on the accuracy of each local\nmodel. Experiments show that with as few as five shots, our approach\nout-performs the original federated meta-learning algorithm in accuracy and\nspeed.

Let $T$ be the time horizon and $P_T$ be the\npath-length that essentially reflects the non-stationarity of environments, the\nstate-of-the-art dynamic regret is $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T(1+P_T)})$. Although\nthis bound is proved to be minimax optimal for convex functions, in this paper,\nwe demonstrate that it is possible to further enhance the guarantee for some\neasy problem instances, particularly when online functions are smooth.\nSpecifically, we propose novel online algorithms that can leverage smoothness\nand replace the dependence on $T$ in the dynamic regret by\n\\emph{problem-dependent} quantities: the variation in gradients of loss\nfunctions, the cumulative loss of the comparator sequence, and the minimum of\nthe previous two terms. These quantities are at most $\\mathcal{O}(T)$ while\ncould be much smaller in benign environments. Therefore, our results are\nadaptive to the intrinsic difficulty of the problem, since the bounds are\ntighter than existing results for easy problems and meanwhile guarantee the\nsame rate in the worst case.

In\naddition, the noise in the face images inhibits the correct capture of facial\nattributes, thus needing to be reliably addressed. Moreover, most existing\nmethods rely on additional dependencies, posing numerous constraints over the\ntraining procedure. Therefore, we propose a Self-Supervised RObustifying\nGUidancE (ROGUE) framework to obtain robustness against occlusions and noise in\nthe face images. The proposed network contains 1) the Guidance Pipeline to\nobtain the 3D face coefficients for the clean faces, and 2) the Robustification\nPipeline to acquire the consistency between the estimated coefficients for\noccluded or noisy images and the clean counterpart. The proposed image- and\nfeature-level loss functions aid the ROGUE learning process without posing\nadditional dependencies. On the three variations of the test dataset of CelebA:\nrational occlusions, delusional occlusions, and noisy face images, our method\noutperforms the current state-of-the-art method by large margins (e.g., for the\nshape-based 3D vertex errors, a reduction from 0.146 to 0.048 for rational\nocclusions, from 0.292 to 0.061 for delusional occlusions and from 0.269 to\n0.053 for the noise in the face images), demonstrating the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Training a machine learning model with federated edge learning (FEEL) is\ntypically time-consuming due to the constrained computation power of edge\ndevices and limited wireless resources in edge networks. In this paper, the\ntraining time minimization problem is investigated in a quantized FEEL system,\nwhere the heterogeneous edge devices send quantized gradients to the edge\nserver via orthogonal channels. In particular, a stochastic quantization scheme\nis adopted for compression of uploaded gradients, which can reduce the burden\nof per-round communication but may come at the cost of increasing number of\ncommunication rounds. The training time is modeled by taking into account the\ncommunication time, computation time and the number of communication rounds.\nBased on the proposed training time model, the intrinsic trade-off between the\nnumber of communication rounds and per-round latency is characterized.\nSpecifically, we analyze the convergence behavior of the quantized FEEL in\nterms of the optimality gap. Further, a joint data-and-model-driven fitting\nmethod is proposed to obtain the exact optimality gap, based on which the\nclosed-form expressions for the number of communication rounds and the total\ntraining time are obtained. Constrained by total bandwidth, the training time\nminimization problem is formulated as a joint quantization level and bandwidth\nallocation optimization problem. To this end, an algorithm based on alternating\noptimization is proposed, which alternatively solves the subproblem of\nquantization optimization via successive convex approximation and the\nsubproblem of bandwidth allocation via bisection search. With different\nlearning tasks and models, the validation of our analysis and the near-optimal\nperformance of the proposed optimization algorithm are demonstrated by the\nexperimental results.",

By routing tokens with a sparse\ngate to a few experts that each only contains part of the full model, MoE keeps\nthe model size unchanged and significantly reduces per-token computation, which\neffectively scales neural networks. However, we found that the current approach\nof jointly training experts and the sparse gate introduces a negative impact on\nmodel accuracy, diminishing the efficiency of expensive large-scale model\ntraining.

MoE with DTS-Gate\nnaturally decouples the training of experts and the sparse gate by training all\nexperts at first and then learning the sparse gate.

    "abstract": "In job scheduling, it is well known that Shortest Remaining Processing Time\n(SRPT) minimizes the average flow time. However, SRPT may cause starvation and\nunfairness. To balance fairness and average flow time, one common approach is\nto minimize the $\\ell_2$ norm of flow time. All non-trivial algorithms designed\nfor this problem are offline algorithms based on linear programming rounding.\nFor the online setting, all previous works consider standard scheduling\nalgorithms under the assumptions of speed augmentation or certain input\ndistributions. In their seminal paper, Bansal and Pruhs prove that under speed\naugmentation, fairness is not sacrificed much when SRPT is used [SICOMP 2010].\nHowever, in practice, to achieve better fairness, it is not uncommon to\ncomplement SRPT with some starvation mitigation mechanism.\nNonetheless, starvation mitigation inevitably destroys SRPT's optimality in\nminimizing the average flow time. Thus, it is not clear whether starvation\nmitigation can improve SRPT's performance on minimizing the $\\ell_2$ norm of\nflow time. In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative. Let $n$\nbe the number of jobs. We use an estimate of $n$ to carefully mitigate the\nstarvation caused by SRPT. Given a good estimate of $n$, our starvation\nmitigation mechanism reduces the competitive ratio of SRPT for the $\\ell_2$\nnorm of flow time from $\\Omega(n^{\\frac{1}{2}})$ to $O(n^{\\frac{1}{3}})$.\nFinally, we remark that all the online algorithms considered previously for\nthis problem have competitive ratios $\\tilde{\\Omega}(n^{\\frac{1}{2}})$.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we examine the problem of online decision making under\nuncertainty, which we formulate as planning in the belief space. Maintaining\nbeliefs (i.e., distributions) over high-dimensional states (e.g., entire\ntrajectories) was not only shown to significantly improve accuracy, but also\nallows planning with information-theoretic objectives, as required for the\ntasks of active SLAM and information gathering. Nonetheless, planning under\nthis \"smoothing\" paradigm holds a high computational complexity, which makes it\nchallenging for online solution. Thus, we suggest the following idea: before\nplanning, perform a standalone state variable reordering procedure on the\ninitial belief, and \"push forwards\" all the predicted loop closing variables.\nSince the initial variable order determines which subset of them would be\naffected by incoming updates, such reordering allows us to minimize the total\nnumber of affected variables, and reduce the computational complexity of\ncandidate evaluation during planning. We call this approach PIVOT: Predictive\nIncremental Variable Ordering Tactic. Applying this tactic can also improve the\nstate inference efficiency; if we maintain the PIVOT order after the planning\nsession, then we should similarly reduce the cost of loop closures, when they\nactually occur. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we applied PIVOT in a\nrealistic active SLAM simulation, where we managed to significantly reduce the\ncomputation time of both the planning and inference sessions.

Experimental results show that our\napproach achieves a user defined group fairness degree without losing a\nsignificant amount of accuracy.",

We propose a color image steganographic model based on frequency\nsub-band selection to solve the above problems.

Then, we select the B channel of the\nRGB image as the embedding channel and the high-frequency sub-band as the\nembedding domain. DWT(discrete wavelet transformation) transforms B channel\ninformation and secret gray image into frequency domain information, and then\nthe secret image is embedded and extracted in the frequency domain.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that images generated by our model have\nbetter image quality, and the imperceptibility is significantly increased.",

Despite of the recent success of GNNs, the\ngraph convolution in most GNNs have two limitations. Since the graph\nconvolution is performed in a small local neighborhood on the input graph, it\nis inherently incapable to capture long-range dependencies between distance\nnodes. In addition, when a node has neighbors that belong to different classes,\ni.e., heterophily, the aggregated messages from them often negatively affect\nrepresentation learning. To address the two common problems of graph\nconvolution, in this paper, we propose Deformable Graph Convolutional Networks\n(Deformable GCNs) that adaptively perform convolution in multiple latent spaces\nand capture short/long-range dependencies between nodes. Separated from node\nrepresentations (features), our framework simultaneously learns the node\npositional embeddings (coordinates) to determine the relations between nodes in\nan end-to-end fashion. Depending on node position, the convolution kernels are\ndeformed by deformation vectors and apply different transformations to its\nneighbor nodes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Deformable GCNs\nflexibly handles the heterophily and achieve the best performance in node\nclassification tasks on six heterophilic graph datasets.",

    "abstract": "The stochastic dynamic matching problem has recently drawn attention in the\nstochastic-modeling community due to its numerous applications, ranging from\nsupply-chain management to kidney exchange programs. In this paper, we consider\na matching problem in which items of different classes arrive according to\nindependent Poisson processes. Unmatched items are stored in a queue, and\ncompatibility constraints are described by a simple graph on the classes, so\nthat two items can be matched if their classes are neighbors in the graph. We\nanalyze the efficiency of matching policies, not only in terms of system\nstability, but also in terms of matching rates between different classes. Our\nresults rely on the observation that, under any stable policy, the matching\nrates satisfy a conservation equation that equates the arrival and departure\nrates of each item class. Our main contributions are threefold. We first\nintroduce a mapping between the dimension of the solution set of this\nconservation equation, the structure of the compatibility graph, and the\nexistence of a stable policy. In particular, this allows us to derive a\nnecessary and sufficient stability condition that is verifiable in polynomial\ntime. Secondly, we describe the convex polytope of non-negative solutions of\nthe conservation equation. When this polytope is reduced to a single point, we\ngive a closed-form expression of the solution; in general, we characterize the\nvertices of this polytope using again the graph structure. Lastly, we show that\ngreedy policies cannot, in general, achieve every point in the polytope. In\ncontrast, non-greedy policies can reach any point of the interior of this\npolytope, and we give a condition for these policies to also reach the boundary\nof the polytope.",

Yet, the underlying concepts remain\nsomewhat elusive and lack generally agreed definitions. While recent\ninspiration from social sciences has refocused the work on needs and\nexpectations of human recipients, the field still misses a concrete\nconceptualisation. We take steps towards addressing this challenge by reviewing\nthe philosophical and social foundations of human explainability, which we then\ntranslate into the technological realm. In particular, we scrutinise the notion\nof algorithmic black boxes and the spectrum of understanding determined by\nexplanatory processes and explainees' background knowledge. This approach\nallows us to define explainability as (logical) reasoning applied to\ntransparent insights (into black boxes) interpreted under certain background\nknowledge - a process that engenders understanding in explainees. We then\nemploy this conceptualisation to revisit the much disputed trade-off between\ntransparency and predictive power and its implications for ante-hoc and\npost-hoc explainers as well as fairness and accountability engendered by\nexplainability. We furthermore discuss components of the machine learning\nworkflow that may be in need of interpretability, building on a range of ideas\nfrom human-centred explainability, with a focus on explainees, contrastive\nstatements and explanatory processes. Our discussion reconciles and complements\ncurrent research to help better navigate open questions - rather than\nattempting to address any individual issue - thus laying a solid foundation for\na grounded discussion and future progress of explainable artificial\nintelligence and interpretable machine learning.

However, these models\nstill contain some inherent shortcomings of RNN, such as vanishing and\nexploding gradient and long-term dependency problems. Meanwhile, Transformer\nbased on self-attention has achieved great success in sequential modeling like\ntext processing and speech recognition. Although the Transformer Hawkes process\n(THP) has gained huge performance improvement, THPs do not effectively utilize\nthe temporal information in the asynchronous events, for these asynchronous\nsequences, the event occurrence instants are as important as the types of\nevents, while conventional THPs simply convert temporal information into\nposition encoding and add them as the input of transformer. With this in mind,\nwe come up with a new kind of Transformer-based Hawkes process model, Temporal\nAttention Augmented Transformer Hawkes Process (TAA-THP), we modify the\ntraditional dot-product attention structure, and introduce the temporal\nencoding into attention structure. We conduct numerous experiments on a wide\nrange of synthetic and real-life datasets to validate the performance of our\nproposed TAA-THP model, significantly improvement compared with existing\nbaseline models on the different measurements is achieved, including\nlog-likelihood on the test dataset, and prediction accuracies of event types\nand occurrence times.

    "abstract": "Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) is a technique to train a deep learning\nmodel to identify unseen classes using the attribute. In this paper, we put\nforth a new GZSL technique that improves the GZSL classification performance\ngreatly. Key idea of the proposed approach, henceforth referred to as semantic\nfeature extraction-based GZSL (SE-GZSL), is to use the semantic feature\ncontaining only attribute-related information in learning the relationship\nbetween the image and the attribute. In doing so, we can remove the\ninterference, if any, caused by the attribute-irrelevant information contained\nin the image feature. To train a network extracting the semantic feature, we\npresent two novel loss functions, 1) mutual information-based loss to capture\nall the attribute-related information in the image feature and 2)\nsimilarity-based loss to remove unwanted attribute-irrelevant information. From\nextensive experiments using various datasets, we show that the proposed SE-GZSL\ntechnique outperforms conventional GZSL approaches by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "Asynchronous events sequences are widely distributed in the natural world and\nhuman activities, such as earthquakes records, users activities in social media\nand so on. How to distill the information from these seemingly disorganized\ndata is a persistent topic that researchers focus on. The one of the most\nuseful model is the point process model, and on the basis, the researchers\nobtain many noticeable results. Moreover, in recent years, point process models\non the foundation of neural networks, especially recurrent neural networks\n(RNN) are proposed and compare with the traditional models, their performance\nare greatly improved. Enlighten by transformer model, which can learning\nsequence data efficiently without recurrent and convolutional structure,\ntransformer Hawkes process is come out, and achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance. However, there is some research proving that the re-introduction\nof recursive calculations in transformer can further improve transformers\nperformance. Thus, we come out with a new kind of transformer Hawkes process\nmodel, universal transformer Hawkes process (UTHP), which contains both\nrecursive mechanism and self-attention mechanism, and to improve the local\nperception ability of the model, we also introduce convolutional neural network\n(CNN) in the position-wise-feed-forward part. We conduct experiments on several\ndatasets to validate the effectiveness of UTHP and explore the changes after\nthe introduction of the recursive mechanism. These experiments on multiple\ndatasets demonstrate that the performance of our proposed new model has a\ncertain improvement compared with the previous state-of-the-art models.",

    "abstract": "Fault seeding is typically used in controlled studies to evaluate and compare\ntest techniques. Central to these techniques lies the hypothesis that\nartificially seeded faults involve some form of realistic properties and thus\nprovide realistic experimental results. In an attempt to strengthen realism, a\nrecent line of research uses advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep\nlearning and Natural Language Processing (NLP), to seed faults that look like\n(syntactically) real ones, implying that fault realism is related to syntactic\nsimilarity. This raises the question of whether seeding syntactically similar\nfaults indeed results in semantically similar faults and more generally whether\nsyntactically dissimilar faults are far away (semantically) from the real ones.\nWe answer this question by employing 4 fault-seeding techniques (PiTest - a\npopular mutation testing tool, IBIR - a tool with manually crafted fault\npatterns, DeepMutation - a learning-based fault seeded framework and CodeBERT -\na novel mutation testing tool that use code embeddings) and demonstrate that\nsyntactic similarity does not reflect semantic similarity. We also show that\n60%, 47%, 43%, and 7% of the real faults of Defects4J V2 are semantically\nresembled by CodeBERT, PiTest, IBIR, and DeepMutation faults. We then perform\nan objective comparison between the techniques and find that CodeBERT and\nPiTest have similar fault detection capabilities that subsume IBIR and\nDeepMutation, and that IBIR is the most cost-effective technique. Moreover, the\noverall fault detection of PiTest, CodeBERT, IBIR, and DeepMutation was, on\naverage, 54%, 53%, 37%, and 7%.",

The novelty of the asymmetric LBCM is that\nusing this model all the follower vehicles in a platoon can adjust their\nacceleration and deceleration to closely follow a constant desired time headway\nat all times to improve platoon operational efficiency while maintaining local\nand string stability. We theoretically prove the local stability of the\nasymmetric LBCM using the condition for asymptotic stability of a linear\ntime-invariant system and derive the condition for string stability using a\nspace headway error attenuation approach. Then, we evaluate the efficacy of the\nasymmetric LBCM by simulating a closely coupled cooperative adaptive cruise\ncontrol (CACC) platoon of fully automated trucks in various non-linear\nacceleration and deceleration states. To evaluate the platoon operational\nefficiency of the asymmetric LBCM, we compare the performance of the asymmetric\nLBCM to a baseline model, i.e., the symmetric LBCM, for three different time\nheadway settings, i.e., 0.6 sec, 0.8 sec, and 1.1 sec.

    "abstract": "Inferring the source of a diffusion in a large network of agents is a\ndifficult but feasible task, if a few agents act as sensors revealing the time\nat which they got hit by the diffusion. A main limitation of current source\ndetection algorithms is that they assume full knowledge of the contact network,\nwhich is rarely the case, especially for epidemics, where the source is called\npatient zero. Inspired by recent contact tracing algorithms, we propose a new\nframework, which we call Source Detection via Contact Tracing Framework\n(SDCTF). In the SDCTF, the source detection task starts at the time of the\nfirst hospitalization, and initially we have no knowledge about the contact\nnetwork other than the identity of the first hospitalized agent. We may then\nexplore the network by contact queries, and obtain symptom onset times by test\nqueries in an adaptive way. We also assume that some of the agents may be\nasymptomatic, and therefore cannot reveal their symptom onset time. Our goal is\nto find patient zero with as few contact and test queries as possible.\nWe propose two local search algorithms for the SDCTF: the LS algorithm is\nmore data-efficient, but can fail to find the true source if many asymptomatic\nagents are present, whereas the LS+ algorithm is more robust to asymptomatic\nagents. By simulations we show that both LS and LS+ outperform state of the art\nadaptive and non-adaptive source detection algorithms adapted to the SDCTF,\neven though these baseline algorithms have full access to the contact network.\nExtending the theory of random exponential trees, we analytically approximate\nthe probability of success of the LS/ LS+ algorithms, and we show that our\nanalytic results match the simulations. Finally, we benchmark our algorithms on\nthe Data-driven COVID-19 Simulator developed by Lorch et al., which is the\nfirst time source detection algorithms are tested on such a complex dataset.",

    "title": "Designing the Topology of Graph Neural Networks: A Novel Feature Fusion  Perspective",
    "abstract": "In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown superior performance\non diverse real-world applications. To improve the model capacity, besides\ndesigning aggregation operations, GNN topology design is also very important.\nIn general, there are two mainstream GNN topology design manners. The first one\nis to stack aggregation operations to obtain the higher-level features but\neasily got performance drop as the network goes deeper. Secondly, the multiple\naggregation operations are utilized in each layer which provides adequate and\nindependent feature extraction stage on local neighbors while are costly to\nobtain the higher-level information. To enjoy the benefits while alleviating\nthe corresponding deficiencies of these two manners, we learn to design the\ntopology of GNNs in a novel feature fusion perspective which is dubbed\nF$^2$GNN. To be specific, we provide a feature fusion perspective in designing\nGNN topology and propose a novel framework to unify the existing topology\ndesigns with feature selection and fusion strategies. Then we develop a neural\narchitecture search method on top of the unified framework which contains a set\nof selection and fusion operations in the search space and an improved\ndifferentiable search algorithm. The performance gains on eight real-world\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of F$^2$GNN. We further conduct\nexperiments to show that F$^2$GNN can improve the model capacity while\nalleviating the deficiencies of existing GNN topology design manners,\nespecially alleviating the over-smoothing problem, by utilizing different\nlevels of features adaptively.",

Optimum positioning of UAVs, serving as base\nstations, can be done through extensive field measurements or ray tracing\nsimulations when the 3D model of the region of interest is available. In this\npaper, we present an alternative approach to optimize UAV base station altitude\nfor a region. The approach is based on deep learning; specifically, a 2D\nsatellite image of the target region is input to a deep neural network to\npredict path loss distributions for different UAV altitudes. The predicted path\ndistributions are used to calculate the coverage in the region; and the optimum\naltitude, maximizing the coverage, is determined. The neural network is\ndesigned and trained to produce multiple path loss distributions in a single\ninference; thus, it is not necessary to train a separate network for each\naltitude.",

We conduct an exploratory study to investigate the properties\nof commit-relevant mutants, i.e., the test elements of commit-aware mutation\ntesting, by offering a general definition and an experimental approach to\nidentify them. We thus, aim at investigating the prevalence, location,\ncomparative advantages of commit-aware mutation testing over time (i.e., the\nprogram evolution) and the predictive power of several commit-related features\nto understand the essential properties for its best-effort application case.\nOur approach utilizes the impact of mutants and the effects of one mutant on\nanother in capturing and analyzing the implicit interactions between the\nchanged and unchanged code parts. The study analyses millions of mutants (over\n10 million), 288 commits, five (5) different open-source software projects\ninvolving over 68,213 CPU days of computation and sets a ground truth where we\nperform our analysis. Our analysis shows that commit-relevant mutants are\nlocated mainly outside of program commit change (81%), while an effective\nselection of commit-relevant mutants can reduce the number of mutants by up to\n93%. In addition, we demonstrate that commit relevant mutation testing is\nsignificantly more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines. Our\nanalysis of the predictive power of mutants and commit-related features in\npredicting commit-relevant mutants found that most proxy features do not\nreliably predict commit-relevant mutants.

    "abstract": "We extend and combine several tools of the literature to design fast,\nadaptive, anytime and scale-free online learning algorithms. Scale-free regret\nbounds must scale linearly with the maximum loss, both toward large losses and\ntoward very small losses. Adaptive regret bounds demonstrate that an algorithm\ncan take advantage of easy data and potentially have constant regret. We seek\nto develop fast algorithms that depend on as few parameters as possible, in\nparticular they should be anytime and thus not depend on the time horizon. Our\nfirst and main tool, isotuning, is a generalization of the idea of balancing\nthe trade-off of the regret. We develop a set of tools to design and analyze\nsuch learning rates easily and show that they adapts automatically to the rate\nof the regret (whether constant, $O(\\log T)$, $O(\\sqrt{T})$, etc.) within a\nfactor 2 of the optimal learning rate in hindsight for the same observed\nquantities. The second tool is an online correction, which allows us to obtain\ncentered bounds for many algorithms, to prevent the regret bounds from being\nvacuous when the domain is overly large or only partially constrained. The last\ntool, null updates, prevents the algorithm from performing overly large\nupdates, which could result in unbounded regret, or even invalid updates. We\ndevelop a general theory using these tools and apply it to several standard\nalgorithms. In particular, we (almost entirely) restore the adaptivity to small\nlosses of FTRL for unbounded domains, design and prove scale-free adaptive\nguarantees for a variant of Mirror Descent (at least when the Bregman\ndivergence is convex in its second argument), extend Adapt-ML-Prod to\nscale-free guarantees, and provide several other minor contributions about\nProd, AdaHedge, BOA and Soft-Bayes.",

    "abstract": "Extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) communication is a promising technology\nto improve the capacity for future 6G networks. With a very large number of\nantennas, the near-field property of XL-MIMO systems becomes dominant. Unlike\nthe classical far-field line-of-sight (LoS) channel with rank one, the\nsignificantly increased degrees of freedom (DoFs) are available in the\nnear-field LoS channel. However, limited by the small number of radio frequency\n(RF) chains, the existing hybrid precoding architecture widely used for 5G is\nnot able to utilize the extra DoFs in the near-field region. In this paper, we\npropose the distance-aware precoding (DAP) scheme to exploit the near-field\neffect as a new possibility for capacity improvement. Firstly, the DAP\narchitecture is developed, where each RF chain can be flexibly controlled as\nactive or inactive according to the distance-related DoFs. Then, a dedicated\nselection circuit is inserted to connect phase shifters and RF chains.\nMoreover, based on the developed DAP architecture, a DAP algorithm is proposed\nto jointly optimize the number of activated RF chains and precoding matrices to\nmatch the increased DoFs in the near-field region. Finally, simulation results\nverify that, the proposed DAP scheme can efficiently utilize the extra DoFs in\nthe near-field region to improve the capacity.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there have been unprecedented technological advances in\nsensor technology, and sensors have become more affordable than ever. Thus,\nsensor-driven data collection is increasingly becoming an attractive and\npractical option for researchers around the globe. Such data is typically\nextracted in the form of time series data, which can be investigated with data\nmining techniques to summarize behaviors of a range of subjects including\nhumans and animals. While enabling cheap and mass collection of data,\ncontinuous sensor data recording results in datasets which are big in size and\nvolume, which are challenging to process and analyze with traditional\ntechniques in a timely manner. Such collected sensor data is typically\nextracted in the form of time series data. There are two main approaches in the\nliterature, namely, shape-based classification and feature-based\nclassification. Shape-based classification determines the best class according\nto a distance measure. Feature-based classification, on the other hand,\nmeasures properties of the time series and finds the best class according to\nthe set of features defined for the time series. In this dissertation, we\ndemonstrate that neither of the two techniques will dominate for some problems,\nbut that some combination of both might be the best. In other words, on a\nsingle problem, it might be possible that one of the techniques is better for\none subset of the behaviors, and the other technique is better for another\nsubset of behaviors. We introduce a hybrid algorithm to classify behaviors,\nusing both shape and feature measures, in weakly labeled time series data\ncollected from sensors to quantify specific behaviors performed by the subject.\nWe demonstrate that our algorithm can robustly classify real, noisy, and\ncomplex datasets, based on a combination of shape and features, and tested our\nproposed algorithm on real-world datasets.",

    "abstract": "We study universal consistency of non-i.i.d. processes in the context of\nonline learning. A stochastic process is said to admit universal consistency if\nthere exists a learner that achieves vanishing average loss for any measurable\nresponse function on this process. When the loss function is unbounded,\nBlanchard et al. showed that the only processes admitting strong universal\nconsistency are those taking a finite number of values almost surely. However,\nwhen the loss function is bounded, the class of processes admitting strong\nuniversal consistency is much richer and its characterization could be\ndependent on the response setting (Hanneke). In this paper, we show that this\nclass of processes is independent from the response setting thereby closing an\nopen question (Hanneke, Open Problem 3). Specifically, we show that the class\nof processes that admit universal online learning is the same for binary\nclassification as for multiclass classification with countable number of\nclasses. Consequently, any output setting with bounded loss can be reduced to\nbinary classification. Our reduction is constructive and practical. Indeed, we\nshow that the nearest neighbor algorithm is transported by our construction.\nFor binary classification on a process admitting strong universal learning, we\nprove that nearest neighbor successfully learns at least all finite unions of\nintervals.",

There is consensus in the research literature that face\nrecognition accuracy is lower for females, who often have both a higher false\nmatch rate and a higher false non-match rate. However, there is little\npublished research aimed at identifying the cause of lower accuracy for\nfemales. For instance, the 2019 Face Recognition Vendor Test that documents\nlower female accuracy across a broad range of algorithms and datasets also\nlists ''Analyze cause and effect'' under the heading ''What we did not do''. We\npresent the first experimental analysis to identify major causes of lower face\nrecognition accuracy for females on datasets where previous research has\nobserved this result. Controlling for equal amount of visible face in the test\nimages mitigates the apparent higher false non-match rate for females.\nAdditional analysis shows that makeup-balanced datasets further improves\nfemales to achieve lower false non-match rates.

One impactful yet challenging\ntask in robotics-powered smart factory applications is robotic grasping: using\nrobotic arms to grasp objects autonomously in different settings. Robotic\ngrasping requires a variety of computer vision tasks such as object detection,\nsegmentation, grasp prediction, pick planning, etc. While significant progress\nhas been made in leveraging of machine learning for robotic grasping,\nparticularly with deep learning, a big challenge remains in the need for\nlarge-scale, high-quality RGBD datasets that cover a wide diversity of\nscenarios and permutations. To tackle this big, diverse data problem, we are\ninspired by the recent rise in the concept of metaverse, which has greatly\nclosed the gap between virtual worlds and the physical world. Metaverses allow\nus to create digital twins of real-world manufacturing scenarios and to\nvirtually create different scenarios from which large volumes of data can be\ngenerated for training models. In this paper, we present MetaGraspNet: a\nlarge-scale benchmark dataset for vision-driven robotic grasping via\nphysics-based metaverse synthesis. The proposed dataset contains 100,000 images\nand 25 different object types and is split into 5 difficulties to evaluate\nobject detection and segmentation model performance in different grasping\nscenarios. We also propose a new layout-weighted performance metric alongside\nthe dataset for evaluating object detection and segmentation performance in a\nmanner that is more appropriate for robotic grasp applications compared to\nexisting general-purpose performance metrics.

Traditionally, water management associations operate large sensor\nnetworks to suffice their needs for hydrological and meteorological measurement\ndata to monitor and model physical processes within catchments. Implementing a\ncomprehensive monitoring system often suffers from sparse coverage of in-situ\ndata. Due to the evolvement of the Copernicus satellite platforms, the broader\navailability of satellite data provides a great potential for deriving\ncomplementary information from Earth Observation data. Although the number of\nsatellite data platforms that provide online processing environments is\ngrowing, it is still a big challenge to integrate those platforms into\ntraditional workflows of users from environmental domains such as hydrology.\nThus, in this paper, we introduce a software architecture to facilitate the\ngeneration of Earth Observation information targeted towards hydrology.

A low-synch modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS)-GMRES algorithm is described\nthat employs a Neumann series to accelerate the projection step. A corollary to\nthe backward stability result of Paige et al. (2006) demonstrates that the\ntruncated Neumann series approximation is sufficient for convergence of GMRES.\nThe lower triangular solver associated with the correction matrix $T_m = (\\: I\n+ L_m \\:)^{-1}$ may then be replaced by a matrix-vector product with $T_m = I -\nL_m$. Next, Neumann series are applied to accelerate the classical\nR\\\"uge-Stuben algebraic multigrid preconditioner using both a polynomial\nGauss-Seidel or incomplete ILU smoother. The sparse triangular solver employed\nin these smoothers is replaced by an inner iteration based upon matrix-vector\nproducts. Henrici's departure from normality of the associated iteration\nmatrices leads to a better understanding of these series. Connections are made\nbetween the (non)normality of the $L$ and $U$ factors and nonlinear stability\nanalysis, as well as the pseudospectra of the coefficient matrix. Furthermore,\nre-orderings that preserve structural symmetry also reduce the departure from\nnormality of the upper triangular factor and improve the relative residual of\nthe triangular solves. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on\nmany-core architectures, the proposed solver and preconditioner are applied to\nthe pressure continuity equation for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations\nof fluid motion. The pressure solve time is reduced considerably with no change\nin the convergence rate and the polynomial Gauss-Seidel smoother is compared\nwith a Jacobi smoother.

For this, we\nfirst design continuous motion representations through the lens of positional\nembeddings. Then, we explore the question of training on very sparse videos and\ndemonstrate that a good generator can be learned by using as few as 2 frames\nper clip. After that, we rethink the traditional image and video discriminators\npair and propose to use a single hypernetwork-based one.

In this\npaper, a data exchange scheme is proposed utilizing unsupervised learning to\nenable efficient lost packet retrieval through reliable wireless transmissions\nbetween UAVs instead of through retransmissions of macro BSs with a longer\ndelay and higher overhead. With the proposed scheme, all UAVs are assigned to\nmultiple clusters and a UAV can only request its lost packets to UAVs in the\nsame cluster. By this way, UAVs in different clusters could carry out their\nlost packets retrieval processes simultaneously to expedite data exchange. The\nagglomerative hierarchical clustering, a type of unsupervised learning, is used\nto conduct clustering, guaranteeing that UAVs clustered together could supply\nand supplement each other's lost packets. To further enhance data exchange\nefficiency, a data exchange mechanism is designed, where the priority of UAVs\nperforming data exchange is determined by the number of their lost packets or\nthe number of requested packets that they can provide.

    "abstract": "Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) i.e., self-driving cars, operate in a safety\ncritical domain, since errors in the autonomous driving software can lead to\nhuge losses. Statistically, road intersections which are a part of the AVs\noperational design domain (ODD), have some of the highest accident rates.\nHence, testing AVs to the limits on road intersections and assuring their\nsafety on road intersections is pertinent, and thus the focus of this paper. We\npresent a situation coverage-based (SitCov) AV-testing framework for the\nverification and validation (V&V) and safety assurance of AVs, developed in an\nopen-source AV simulator named CARLA. The SitCov AV-testing framework focuses\non vehicle-to-vehicle interaction on a road intersection under different\nenvironmental and intersection configuration situations, using situation\ncoverage criteria for automatic test suite generation for safety assurance of\nAVs. We have developed an ontology for intersection situations, and used it to\ngenerate a situation hyperspace i.e., the space of all possible situations\narising from that ontology. For the evaluation of our SitCov AV-testing\nframework, we have seeded multiple faults in our ego AV, and compared situation\ncoverage based and random situation generation. We have found that both\ngeneration methodologies trigger around the same number of seeded faults, but\nthe situation coverage-based generation tells us a lot more about the\nweaknesses of the autonomous driving algorithm of our ego AV, especially in\nedge-cases. Our code is publicly available online, anyone can use our SitCov\nAV-testing framework and use it or build further on top of it. This paper aims\nto contribute to the domain of V&V and development of AVs, not only from a\ntheoretical point of view, but also from the viewpoint of an open-source\nsoftware contribution and releasing a flexible/effective tool for V&V and\ndevelopment of AVs.",

Here, we\nintroduce Physics-Informed Deep Operator Control (PIDOC), by encoding control\nsignal and initial position into the losses of a Physics-Informed Neural\nNetwork (PINN), the nonlinear system exhibits the desired route given the\ncontrol signal. The framework has a clear application scenario: receiving\nsignals as physics commands and learning chaotic data from the nonlinear van\nder Pol system, PIDOC is able to execute the controlled signal as the output of\nthe PINN. PIDOC is first applied to a benchmark problem, unveils a fluctuating\nbehavior of the acceleration that seemingly behave in the same frequency of the\ndesired signal, indicating the learning of neural networks (NN) elicit\nstochasticity for higher-order terms, yet still successfully impose the control\nthat enforces the system behave as in the same frequency of the control signal.\nPIDOC is also proved capable of converging to different desired trajectories\nbased on case studies. Initial positions slightly affect the control accuracy\nat the beginning stage yet still converge to the control signal based on\nnumerical experiments. To note, for highly nonlinear systems, PIDOC is not able\nto execute control as high accuracies compared with the benchmark problem, yet\nstill, PIDOC converges to decent trajectories corresponding to given signals\nwith fair predictable behavior. The depth and width of the NN structure did not\nheavily variate the convergence of PIDOC based on case studies on van der Pol\nsystems with low and high nonlinearities. Surprisingly, by enlarging the\ncontrol signal by multiplying a Lagrangian multiplier, PIDOC failed to converge\nto the desired trajectory, indicating enlarging the control signal does not\nincrease control quality, which is not intuitive.

Motivated by the recent advances in deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL), we address multi-agent DRL-based joint dynamic\nchannel access and power control in a wireless interference network. We first\npropose a multi-agent DRL algorithm with centralized training (DRL-CT) to\ntackle the joint resource allocation problem. In this case, the training is\nperformed at the central unit (CU) and after training, the users make\nautonomous decisions on their transmission strategies with only local\ninformation. We demonstrate that with limited information exchange and faster\nconvergence, DRL-CT algorithm can achieve 90% of the performance achieved by\nthe combination of weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm for\npower control and exhaustive search for dynamic channel access. In the second\npart of this paper, we consider distributed multi-agent DRL scenario in which\neach user conducts its own training and makes its decisions individually,\nacting as a DRL agent. Finally, as a compromise between centralized and fully\ndistributed scenarios, we consider federated DRL (FDRL) to approach the\nperformance of DRL-CT with the use of a central unit in training while limiting\nthe information exchange and preserving privacy of the users in the wireless\nsystem.

One seeks codebooks of sequences in which each sequence has low\naperiodic autocorrelation at all nonzero shifts, and each pair of distinct\nsequences has low aperiodic crosscorrelation at all shifts. An overall\ncriterion of codebook quality is the demerit factor, which normalizes all\nsequences to unit Euclidean norm, sums the squared magnitudes of all the\ncorrelations between every pair of sequences in the codebook (including\nsequences with themselves to cover autocorrelations), and divides by the square\nof the number of sequences in the codebook. This demerit factor is expected to\nbe $1+1/N-1/(\\ell N)$ for a codebook of $N$ randomly selected binary sequences\nof length $\\ell$, but we want demerit factors much closer to the absolute\nminimum value of $1$. For each $N$ such that there is an $N\\times N$ Hadamard\nmatrix, we use cyclotomy to construct an infinite family of codebooks of binary\nsequences, in which each codebook has $N-1$ sequences of length $p$, where $p$\nruns through the primes with $N\\mid p-1$.

Disentanglement methods\naim to learn representations which capture different factors of variation in\nlatent subspaces. A common approach involves minimizing the mutual information\nbetween latent subspaces, such that each encodes a single underlying attribute.\nHowever, this fails when attributes are correlated.

However,\nit is still unclear how to make the zero-shot recognition working well on\nbroader vision problems, such as object detection and semantic segmentation. In\nthis paper, we target for zero-shot semantic segmentation, by building it on an\noff-the-shelf pre-trained vision-language model, i.e., CLIP. It is difficult\nbecause semantic segmentation and the CLIP model perform on different visual\ngranularity, that semantic segmentation processes on pixels while CLIP performs\non images. To remedy the discrepancy on processing granularity, we refuse the\nuse of the prevalent one-stage FCN based framework, and advocate a two-stage\nsemantic segmentation framework, with the first stage extracting generalizable\nmask proposals and the second stage leveraging an image based CLIP model to\nperform zero-shot classification on the masked image crops which are generated\nin the first stage.

    "abstract": "In order to submit a claim to insurance companies, a doctor needs to code a\npatient encounter with both the diagnosis (ICDs) and procedures performed\n(CPTs) in an Electronic Health Record (EHR). Identifying and applying relevant\nprocedures code is a cumbersome and time-consuming task as a doctor has to\nchoose from around 13,000 procedure codes with no predefined one-to-one\nmapping.

Assigning color to an image is a highly ill-posed problem because of its\ninnate nature of possessing very high degrees of freedom; given an image, there\nis often no single color-combination that is correct. Besides colorization,\nanother problem in reconstruction of images is Single Image Super Resolution,\nwhich aims at transforming low resolution images to a higher resolution. This\nresearch aims to provide an automated approach for the problem by focusing on a\nvery specific domain of images, namely astronomical images, and process them\nusing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We explore the usage of various\nmodels in two different color spaces, RGB and L*a*b. We use transferred\nlearning owing to a small data set, using pre-trained ResNet-18 as a backbone,\ni.e. encoder for the U-net and fine-tune it further. The model produces\nvisually appealing images which hallucinate high resolution, colorized data in\nthese results which does not exist in the original image. We present our\nresults by evaluating the GANs quantitatively using distance metrics such as L1\ndistance and L2 distance in each of the color spaces across all channels to\nprovide a comparative analysis.

    "abstract": "To curate a high-quality dataset, identifying data variance between the\ninternal and external sources is a fundamental and crucial step. However,\nmethods to detect shift or variance in data have not been significantly\nresearched. Challenges to this are the lack of effective approaches to learn\ndense representation of a dataset and difficulties of sharing private data\nacross medical institutions. To overcome the problems, we propose a unified\npipeline called MedShift to detect the top-level shift samples and thus\nfacilitate the medical curation. Given an internal dataset A as the base\nsource, we first train anomaly detectors for each class of dataset A to learn\ninternal distributions in an unsupervised way. Second, without exchanging data\nacross sources, we run the trained anomaly detectors on an external dataset B\nfor each class. The data samples with high anomaly scores are identified as\nshift data. To quantify the shiftness of the external dataset, we cluster B's\ndata into groups class-wise based on the obtained scores. We then train a\nmulti-class classifier on A and measure the shiftness with the classifier's\nperformance variance on B by gradually dropping the group with the largest\nanomaly score for each class. Additionally, we adapt a dataset quality metric\nto help inspect the distribution differences for multiple medical sources. We\nverify the efficacy of MedShift with musculoskeletal radiographs (MURA) and\nchest X-rays datasets from more than one external source. Experiments show our\nproposed shift data detection pipeline can be beneficial for medical centers to\ncurate high-quality datasets more efficiently.

Among the three objective\nquality measures, full-reference and reduced-reference methods require an\noriginal image in some form to calculate the quality score which is not\nfeasible in scenarios such as broadcasting or IP video.

To eradicate such bias, local polynomial regression (LPoR) and multiscale\n$k$-NN (MS-$k$-NN) learn the bias term by local regression around the query and\nextrapolate it to the query itself. However, their theoretical optimality has\nbeen shown for the limit of the infinite number of training samples. For\ncorrecting the asymptotic bias with fewer observations, this paper proposes a\nlocal radial regression (LRR) and its logistic regression variant called local\nradial logistic regression (LRLR), by combining the advantages of LPoR and\nMS-$k$-NN. The idea is simple: we fit the local regression to observed labels\nby taking the radial distance as the explanatory variable and then extrapolate\nthe estimated label probability to zero distance.

    "abstract": "Machine learning has become successful in solving wireless interference\nmanagement problems. Different kinds of deep neural networks (DNNs) have been\ntrained to accomplish key tasks such as power control, beamforming and\nadmission control. There are two popular training paradigms for such DNNs-based\ninterference management models: supervised learning (i.e., fitting labels\ngenerated by an optimization algorithm) and unsupervised learning (i.e.,\ndirectly optimizing some system performance measure). Although both of these\nparadigms have been extensively applied in practice, due to the lack of any\ntheoretical understanding about these methods, it is not clear how to\nsystematically understand and compare their performance.\nIn this work, we conduct theoretical studies to provide some in-depth\nunderstanding about these two training paradigms. First, we show a somewhat\nsurprising result, that for some special power control problem, the\nunsupervised learning can perform much worse than its supervised counterpart,\nbecause it is more likely to stuck at some low-quality local solutions. We then\nprovide a series of theoretical results to further understand the properties of\nthe two approaches. Generally speaking, we show that when high-quality labels\nare available, then the supervised learning is less likely to be stuck at a\nsolution than its unsupervised counterpart. Additionally, we develop a\nsemi-supervised learning approach which properly integrates these two training\nparadigms, and can effectively utilize limited number of labels to find\nhigh-quality solutions.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a diffusive predator-prey system with spatial\nmemory and predator-taxis. Since in this system, the memory delay appears in\nthe diffusion term, and the diffusion term is nonlinear, the classical normal\nform of Hopf bifurcation in the reaction-diffusion system with delay can't be\napplied to this system. Thus, in this paper, we first derive an algorithm for\ncalculating the normal form of Hopf bifurcation in this system. Then in order\nto illustrate the effectiveness of our newly developed algorithm, we consider\nthe diffusive Holling-Tanner model with spatial memory and predator-taxis. The\nstability and Hopf bifurcation analysis of this model are investigated, and the\ndirection and stability of Hopf bifurcation periodic solution are also\nresearched by using our newly developed algorithm for calculating the normal\nform of Hopf bifurcation. At last, we carry out some numerical simulations, two\nstable spatially inhomogeneous periodic solutions corresponding to the mode-1\nand mode-2 Hopf bifurcations are found, which verifies our theoretical analysis\nresults.",

To solve the problem, two coordinate\nchanges are proposed. The first coordinate change reduces the output variable\nof the system to a new variable which dimension does not exceed the control\ndimension. The second coordinate change allows one to pass from a constrained\ncontrol problem to an unconstrained one. In order to illustrate the efficiency\nof the method, the solution of two problems is considered. The first task is\nstate feedback control of linear systems, taking into account the constraints\non the control signal and phase variables. The second task is output feedback\ncontrol of linear systems with a restriction on output and control. In both\nproblems, checking the stability of the closed-loop system is formulated in\nterms of the solvability of linear matrix inequalities. The obtained results\nare accompanied by examples of modeling that illustrate the efficiency of the\nproposed method.",

Training-free model-agnostic defenses have\nrecently gained popularity due to their speed, ease of deployment, and ability\nto work across many DNNs. To this end, a new technique has emerged for\nmitigating attacks on image classification DNNs, namely, preprocessing\nadversarial images using super resolution -- upscaling low-quality inputs into\nhigh-resolution images. This defense requires running both image classifiers\nand super resolution models on constrained autonomous systems. However, super\nresolution incurs a heavy computational cost. Therefore, in this paper, we\ninvestigate the following question: Does the robustness of image classifiers\nsuffer if we use tiny super resolution models? To answer this, we first review\na recent work called Super-Efficient Super Resolution (SESR) that achieves\nsimilar or better image quality than prior art while requiring 2x to 330x fewer\nMultiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations. We demonstrate that despite being orders\nof magnitude smaller than existing models, SESR achieves the same level of\nrobustness as significantly larger networks.

    "abstract": "We propose an efficient, reliable, and interpretable global solution method,\n$\\textit{Deep learning-based algorithm for Heterogeneous Agent Models,\nDeepHAM}$, for solving high dimensional heterogeneous agent models with\naggregate shocks. The state distribution is approximately represented by a set\nof optimal generalized moments. Deep neural networks are used to approximate\nthe value and policy functions, and the objective is optimized over directly\nsimulated paths. Besides being an accurate global solver, this method has three\nadditional features. First, it is computationally efficient for solving complex\nheterogeneous agent models, and it does not suffer from the curse of\ndimensionality. Second, it provides a general and interpretable representation\nof the distribution over individual states; and this is important for\naddressing the classical question of whether and how heterogeneity matters in\nmacroeconomics. Third, it solves the constrained efficiency problem as easily\nas the competitive equilibrium, and this opens up new possibilities for\nstudying optimal monetary and fiscal policies in heterogeneous agent models\nwith aggregate shocks.",

The conventional finite\nelement model (FEM)-based and data-driven approaches for VIV analysis often\nsuffer from the challenges of the computational cost and acquisition of\ndatasets. This paper proposed a transfer learning enhanced the physics-informed\nneural network (PINN) model to study the VIV (2D). The physics-informed neural\nnetwork, when used in conjunction with the transfer learning method, enhances\nlearning efficiency and keeps predictability in the target task by common\ncharacteristics knowledge from the source model without requiring a huge\nquantity of datasets. The datasets obtained from VIV experiment are divided\nevenly two parts (source domain and target domain), to evaluate the performance\nof the model. The results show that the proposed method match closely with the\nresults available in the literature using conventional PINN algorithms even\nthough the quantity of datasets acquired in training model gradually becomes\nsmaller. The application of the model can break the limitation of monitoring\nequipment and methods in the practical projects, and promote the in-depth study\nof VIV.",

    "abstract": "Hamiltonian learning is an important procedure in quantum system\nidentification, calibration, and successful operation of quantum computers.\nThrough queries to the quantum system, this procedure seeks to obtain the\nparameters of a given Hamiltonian model and description of noise sources.\nStandard techniques for Hamiltonian learning require careful design of queries\nand $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ queries in achieving learning error $\\epsilon$ due to\nthe standard quantum limit. With the goal of efficiently and accurately\nestimating the Hamiltonian parameters within learning error $\\epsilon$ through\nminimal queries, we introduce an active learner that is given an initial set of\ntraining examples and the ability to interactively query the quantum system to\ngenerate new training data. We formally specify and experimentally assess the\nperformance of this Hamiltonian active learning (HAL) algorithm for learning\nthe six parameters of a two-qubit cross-resonance Hamiltonian on four different\nsuperconducting IBM Quantum devices. Compared with standard techniques for the\nsame problem and a specified learning error, HAL achieves up to a $99.8\\%$\nreduction in queries required, and a $99.1\\%$ reduction over the comparable\nnon-adaptive learning algorithm. Moreover, with access to prior information on\na subset of Hamiltonian parameters and given the ability to select queries with\nlinearly (or exponentially) longer system interaction times during learning,\nHAL can exceed the standard quantum limit and achieve Heisenberg (or\nsuper-Heisenberg) limited convergence rates during learning.",

We use the Stochastic\nMultiplicative Processes (SMP) to explain such movement, where in the presence\nof a boundary constraint, the SMP leads to a power law distribution.

    "abstract": "Spectral super-resolution (SSR) refers to the hyperspectral image (HSI)\nrecovery from an RGB counterpart. Due to the one-to-many nature of the SSR\nproblem, a single RGB image can be reprojected to many HSIs. The key to tackle\nthis illposed problem is to plug into multi-source prior information such as\nthe natural RGB spatial context-prior, deep feature-prior or inherent HSI\nstatistical-prior, etc., so as to improve the confidence and fidelity of\nreconstructed spectra. However, most current approaches only consider the\ngeneral and limited priors in their designing the customized convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs), which leads to the inability to effectively alleviate\nthe degree of ill-posedness. To address the problematic issues, we propose a\nnovel holistic prior-embedded relation network (HPRN) for SSR. Basically, the\ncore framework is delicately assembled by several multi-residual relation\nblocks (MRBs) that fully facilitate the transmission and utilization of the\nlow-frequency content prior of RGB signals. Innovatively, the semantic prior of\nRGB input is introduced to identify category attributes and a semantic-driven\nspatial relation module (SSRM) is put forward to perform the feature\naggregation among the clustered similar characteristics using a\nsemantic-embedded relation matrix. Additionally, we develop a transformer-based\nchannel relation module (TCRM), which breaks the habit of employing scalars as\nthe descriptors of channel-wise relations in the previous deep feature-prior\nand replaces them with certain vectors, together with Transformerstyle feature\ninteractions, supporting the representations to be more discriminative. In\norder to maintain the mathematical correlation and spectral consistency between\nhyperspectral bands, the second-order prior constraints (SOPC) are incorporated\ninto the loss function to guide the HSI reconstruction process.",

Deep neural networks are becoming an effective\ntool to solve sequential data problems, particularly, adopting an end-to-end\ntraining of the system. Arabic speech recognition is a complex task because of\nthe existence of multiple dialects, non-availability of large corpora, and\nmissing vocalization. Thus, the first contribution of this work is the\ndevelopment of a large multi-dialectal corpus with either full or at least\npartially vocalized transcription. Additionally, the open-source corpus has\nbeen gathered from multiple sources that bring non-standard Arabic alphabets in\ntranscription which are normalized by defining a common character-set. The\nsecond contribution is the development of a framework to train an acoustic\nmodel achieving state-of-the-art performance. The network architecture\ncomprises of a combination of convolutional and recurrent layers. The\nspectrogram features of the audio data are extracted in the frequency vs time\ndomain and fed in the network. The output frames, produced by the recurrent\nmodel, are further trained to align the audio features with its corresponding\ntranscription sequences. The sequence alignment is performed using a beam\nsearch decoder with a tetra-gram language model. The proposed system achieved a\n14% error rate which outperforms previous systems.",

The upper bound is via an iterative\nquery algorithm whose core components are the well-known 1-query quantum\nalgorithm (essentially due to Deutsch) to compute the Hamming weight a 2-bit\nstring mod 2 (i.e., the parity of the input bits), and a new 2-query quantum\nalgorithm to compute the Hamming weight of a 3-bit string mod 3.\nWe show a matching lower bound (in fact for arbitrary moduli $m$) via a\nvariant of the polynomial method [de Wolf, SIAM J. Comput., 32(3), 2003]. This\nbound is for the weaker task of deciding whether or not a given $n$-bit input\nhas Hamming weight 0 modulo $m$, and it holds even in the stronger\nnon-deterministic quantum query model where an algorithm must have positive\nacceptance probability iff its input evaluates to 1. For $m>2$ our lower bound\nexceeds $n/2$, beating the best lower bound provable using the general\npolynomial method [Theorem 4.3, Beals et al., J. ACM 48(4), 2001].",

    "title": "On Local Convergence of Iterative Hard Thresholding for Matrix  Completion",
    "abstract": "Iterative hard thresholding (IHT) has gained in popularity over the past\ndecades in large-scale optimization. However, convergence properties of this\nmethod have only been explored recently in non-convex settings. In matrix\ncompletion, existing works often focus on the guarantee of global convergence\nof IHT via standard assumptions such as incoherence property and uniform\nsampling. While such analysis provides a global upper bound on the linear\nconvergence rate, it does not describe the actual performance of IHT in\npractice. In this paper, we provide a novel insight into the local convergence\nof a specific variant of IHT for matrix completion. We uncover the exact linear\nrate of IHT in a closed-form expression and identify the region of convergence\nin which the algorithm is guaranteed to converge. Furthermore, we utilize\nrandom matrix theory to study the linear rate of convergence of IHTSVD for\nlarge-scale matrix completion. We find that asymptotically, the rate can be\nexpressed in closed form in terms of the relative rank and the sampling rate.\nFinally, we present various numerical results to verify the aforementioned\ntheoretical analysis.",

    "title": "Nonconvex Stochastic Scaled-Gradient Descent and Generalized Eigenvector  Problems",
    "abstract": "Motivated by the problem of online canonical correlation analysis, we propose\nthe \\emph{Stochastic Scaled-Gradient Descent} (SSGD) algorithm for minimizing\nthe expectation of a stochastic function over a generic Riemannian manifold.\nSSGD generalizes the idea of projected stochastic gradient descent and allows\nthe use of scaled stochastic gradients instead of stochastic gradients. In the\nspecial case of a spherical constraint, which arises in generalized eigenvector\nproblems, we establish a nonasymptotic finite-sample bound of $\\sqrt{1/T}$, and\nshow that this rate is minimax optimal, up to a polylogarithmic factor of\nrelevant parameters. On the asymptotic side, a novel trajectory-averaging\nargument allows us to achieve local asymptotic normality with a rate that\nmatches that of Ruppert-Polyak-Juditsky averaging. We bring these ideas\ntogether in an application to online canonical correlation analysis, deriving,\nfor the first time in the literature, an optimal one-time-scale algorithm with\nan explicit rate of local asymptotic convergence to normality. Numerical\nstudies of canonical correlation analysis are also provided for synthetic data.",

    "title": "Multivariate Trend Filtering for Lattice Data",
    "abstract": "We study a multivariate version of trend filtering, called Kronecker trend\nfiltering or KTF, for the case in which the design points form a lattice in $d$\ndimensions. KTF is a natural extension of univariate trend filtering (Steidl et\nal., 2006; Kim et al., 2009; Tibshirani, 2014), and is defined by minimizing a\npenalized least squares problem whose penalty term sums the absolute\n(higher-order) differences of the parameter to be estimated along each of the\ncoordinate directions. The corresponding penalty operator can be written in\nterms of Kronecker products of univariate trend filtering penalty operators,\nhence the name Kronecker trend filtering. Equivalently, one can view KTF in\nterms of an $\\ell_1$-penalized basis regression problem where the basis\nfunctions are tensor products of falling factorial functions, a piecewise\npolynomial (discrete spline) basis that underlies univariate trend filtering.\nThis paper is a unification and extension of the results in Sadhanala et al.\n(2016, 2017). We develop a complete set of theoretical results that describe\nthe behavior of $k^{\\mathrm{th}}$ order Kronecker trend filtering in $d$\ndimensions, for every $k \\geq 0$ and $d \\geq 1$. This reveals a number of\ninteresting phenomena, including the dominance of KTF over linear smoothers in\nestimating heterogeneously smooth functions, and a phase transition at\n$d=2(k+1)$, a boundary past which (on the high dimension-to-smoothness side)\nlinear smoothers fail to be consistent entirely. We also leverage recent\nresults on discrete splines from Tibshirani (2020), in particular, discrete\nspline interpolation results that enable us to extend the KTF estimate to any\noff-lattice location in constant-time (independent of the size of the lattice\n$n$).",
