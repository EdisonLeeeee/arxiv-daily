    "abstract": "Classical fine-grained measurement-based IP geolocation algorithms often rely\non some specific linear delay-distance rules. This could cause unreliable\ngeolocation results in actual network environments where the delay-distance\nrelationship is non-linear. Recently, researchers begin to pay attention to\nlearning-based IP geolocation algorithms. These data-driven algorithms leverage\nmulti-layer perceptron (MLP) to model the network environments. They do not\nneed strong pre-assumptions about the linear delay-distance rule and are\ncapable to learn non-linear relationships. In theory, they should improve the\ngeneralization ability of IP geolocation in different networks. However,\nnetworks are fundamentally represented as graphs. MLP is not well suited to\nmodel information structured as graphs. MLP-based IP geolocation methods treat\ntarget IP addresses as isolated data instances and ignore the connection\ninformation between targets. This would lead to suboptimal representations and\nlimit the geolocation performance.\nGraph convolutional network (GCN) is an emerging deep learning method for\ngraph data presentation. In this work, we research how to model computer\nnetworks for fine-grained IP geolocation with GCN. First, we formulate the IP\ngeolocation task as an attributed graph node regression problem. Then, a\nGCN-based IP geolocation framework named GCN-Geo is proposed to predict the\nlocation of each IP address. Finally, the experimental results in three\nreal-world datasets (New York State, Hong Kong, and Shanghai) show that the\nproposed GCN-Geo framework clearly outperforms the state-of-art rule-based and\nlearning-based baselines on average error distance, median error distance and\nmax error distance. This verifies the potential of GCN in fine-grained IP\ngeolocation.",

For problems with slowly\ndecaying Kolmogorov-n-widths such as certain transport-dominated problems,\nhowever, classical linear-subspace reduced-order models (ROMs) of low dimension\nmight yield inaccurate results. Thus, the concept of classical linear-subspace\nROMs has to be extended to more general concepts, like Model Order Reduction\n(MOR) on manifolds. Moreover, as we are dealing with Hamiltonian systems, it is\ncrucial that the underlying symplectic structure is preserved in the reduced\nmodel, as otherwise it could become unphysical in the sense that the energy is\nnot conserved or stability properties are lost. To the best of our knowledge,\nexisting literature addresses either MOR on manifolds or symplectic model\nreduction for Hamiltonian systems, but not their combination. In this work, we\nbridge the two aforementioned approaches by providing a novel projection\ntechnique called symplectic manifold Galerkin (SMG), which projects the\nHamiltonian system onto a nonlinear symplectic trial manifold such that the\nreduced model is again a Hamiltonian system. We derive analytical results such\nas stability, energy-preservation and a rigorous a-posteriori error bound.\nMoreover, we construct a weakly symplectic deep convolutional autoencoder as a\ncomputationally practical approach to approximate a nonlinear symplectic trial\nmanifold.

However,\nstandard neural networks often fail to understand the concept of hierarchical\nstructures and dependencies among different classes for vision related tasks.\nHumans on the other hand, seem to learn categories conceptually, progressively\ngrowing from understanding high-level concepts down to granular levels of\ncategories. One of the issues arising from the inability of neural networks to\nencode such dependencies within its learned structure is that of subpopulation\nshift -- where models are queried with novel unseen classes taken from a\nshifted population of the training set categories. Since the neural network\ntreats each class as independent from all others, it struggles to categorize\nshifting populations that are dependent at higher levels of the hierarchy. In\nthis work, we study the aforementioned problems through the lens of a novel\nconditional supervised training framework. We tackle subpopulation shift by a\nstructured learning procedure that incorporates hierarchical information\nconditionally through labels. Furthermore, we introduce a notion of graphical\ndistance to model the catastrophic effect of mispredictions. We show that\nlearning in this structured hierarchical manner results in networks that are\nmore robust against subpopulation shifts, with an improvement of around ~2% in\nterms of accuracy and around 8.5\\% in terms of graphical distance over standard\nmodels on subpopulation shift benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "The CP tensor decomposition is used in applications such as machine learning\nand signal processing to discover latent low-rank structure in multidimensional\ndata. Computing a CP decomposition via an alternating least squares (ALS)\nmethod reduces the problem to several linear least squares problems. The\nstandard way to solve these linear least squares subproblems is to use the\nnormal equations, which inherit special tensor structure that can be exploited\nfor computational efficiency. However, the normal equations are sensitive to\nnumerical ill-conditioning, which can compromise the results of the\ndecomposition. In this paper, we develop versions of the CP-ALS algorithm using\nthe QR decomposition and the singular value decomposition (SVD), which are more\nnumerically stable than the normal equations, to solve the linear least squares\nproblems. Our algorithms utilize the tensor structure of the CP-ALS subproblems\nefficiently, have the same complexity as the standard CP-ALS algorithm when the\nrank is small, and are shown via examples to produce more stable results when\nill-conditioning is present. Our MATLAB implementation achieves the same\nrunning time as the standard algorithm for small ranks, and we show that the\nnew methods can obtain lower approximation error and more reliably recover\nlow-rank signals from data with known ground truth.",

    "abstract": "Critical sectors of human society are progressing toward the adoption of\npowerful artificial intelligence (AI) agents, which are trained individually on\nbehalf of self-interested principals but deployed in a shared environment.\nShort of direct centralized regulation of AI, which is as difficult an issue as\nregulation of human actions, one must design institutional mechanisms that\nindirectly guide agents' behaviors to safeguard and improve social welfare in\nthe shared environment. Our paper focuses on one important class of such\nmechanisms: the problem of adaptive incentive design, whereby a central planner\nintervenes on the payoffs of an agent population via incentives in order to\noptimize a system objective. To tackle this problem in high-dimensional\nenvironments whose dynamics may be unknown or too complex to model, we propose\na model-free meta-gradient method to learn an adaptive incentive function in\nthe context of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Via the principle of online\ncross-validation, the incentive designer explicitly accounts for its impact on\nagents' learning and, through them, the impact on future social welfare.\nExperiments on didactic benchmark problems show that the proposed method can\ninduce selfish agents to learn near-optimal cooperative behavior and\nsignificantly outperform learning-oblivious baselines. When applied to a\ncomplex simulated economy, the proposed method finds tax policies that achieve\nbetter trade-off between economic productivity and equality than baselines, a\nresult that we interpret via a detailed behavioral analysis.",

To investigate trade-off between performance and overhead, we\napply embedded pilot-aided and superimposed pilot-based channel estimation\nmethods. We then derive a closed-form expression for the individual user\ndownlink and uplink spectral efficiencies as a function of the numbers of APs,\nusers and delay-Doppler domain channel estimate parameters. Based on these\nanalytical results, we also present new scaling laws that the AP's and user's\ntransmit power should satisfy, to sustain a desirable quality of service. It is\nfound that when the number of APs, $M_a$, grows without bound, we can reduce\nthe transmit power of each user and AP proportionally to $1/M_a$ and $1/M_a^2$,\nrespectively, during the uplink and downlink phases. We compare the OTFS\nperformance with that of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) at\nhigh-mobility conditions. Our findings reveal that with shadowing correlation,\nOTFS modulation with embedded pilot-based channel estimation provides\n$30$-folds gain over the OFDM counterpart in terms of $95\\%$-likely per-user\ndownlink rate.

    "abstract": "In IEEE 802.11 WiFi-based waveforms, the receiver performs coarse time and\nfrequency synchronization using the first field of the preamble known as the\nlegacy short training field (L-STF). The L-STF occupies upto 40% of the\npreamble length and takes upto 32 us of airtime. With the goal of reducing\ncommunication overhead, we propose a modified waveform, where the preamble\nlength is reduced by eliminating the L-STF. To decode this modified waveform,\nwe propose a machine learning (ML)-based scheme called PRONTO that performs\ncoarse time and frequency estimations using other preamble fields, specifically\nthe legacy long training field (L-LTF). Our contributions are threefold: (i) We\npresent PRONTO featuring customized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for\npacket detection and coarse CFO estimation, along with data augmentation steps\nfor robust training.

    "abstract": "Many recent results in imperfect information games were only formulated for,\nor evaluated on, poker and poker-like games such as liar's dice. We argue that\nsequential Bayesian games constitute a natural class of games for generalizing\nthese results. In particular, this model allows for an elegant formulation of\nthe counterfactual regret minimization algorithm, called public-state CFR\n(PS-CFR), which naturally lends itself to an efficient implementation.\nEmpirically, solving a poker subgame with 10^7 states by public-state CFR takes\n3 minutes and 700 MB while a comparable version of vanilla CFR takes 5.5 hours\nand 20 GB. Additionally, the public-state formulation of CFR opens up the\npossibility for exploiting domain-specific assumptions, leading to a quadratic\nreduction in asymptotic complexity (and a further empirical speedup) over\nvanilla CFR in poker and other domains. Overall, this suggests that the ability\nto represent poker as a sequential Bayesian game played a key role in the\nsuccess of CFR-based methods. Finally, we extend public-state CFR to general\nextensive-form games, arguing that this extension enjoys some - but not all -\nof the benefits of the version for sequential Bayesian games.",

This\nbecomes even more important in today's software ecosystem, where vulnerable\ncode can flow easily and unwittingly within and across software repositories\nlike GitHub. Across such millions of lines of code, traditional static and\ndynamic approaches struggle to scale. Although existing machine-learning-based\napproaches look promising in such a setting, most work detects vulnerable code\nat a higher granularity -- at the method or file level. Thus, developers still\nneed to inspect a significant amount of code to locate the vulnerable\nstatement(s) that need to be fixed.\nThis paper presents VELVET, a novel ensemble learning approach to locate\nvulnerable statements. Our model combines graph-based and sequence-based neural\nnetworks to successfully capture the local and global context of a program\ngraph and effectively understand code semantics and vulnerable patterns. To\nstudy VELVET's effectiveness, we use an off-the-shelf synthetic dataset and a\nrecently published real-world dataset. In the static analysis setting, where\nvulnerable functions are not detected in advance, VELVET achieves 4.5x better\nperformance than the baseline static analyzers on the real-world data. For the\nisolated vulnerability localization task, where we assume the vulnerability of\na function is known while the specific vulnerable statement is unknown, we\ncompare VELVET with several neural networks that also attend to local and\nglobal context of code.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proven to be effective in solving many\nreal-life problems, but its high computation cost prohibits those models from\nbeing deployed to edge devices. Pruning, as a method to introduce zeros to\nmodel weights, has shown to be an effective method to provide good trade-offs\nbetween model accuracy and computation efficiency, and is a widely-used method\nto generate compressed models. However, the granularity of pruning makes\nimportant trade-offs. At the same sparsity level, a coarse-grained structured\nsparse pattern is more efficient on conventional hardware but results in worse\naccuracy, while a fine-grained unstructured sparse pattern can achieve better\naccuracy but is inefficient on existing hardware.\nOn the other hand, some modern processors are equipped with fast on-chip\nscratchpad memories and gather/scatter engines that perform indirect load and\nstore operations on such memories. In this work, we propose a set of novel\nsparse patterns, named gather-scatter (GS) patterns, to utilize the scratchpad\nmemories and gather/scatter engines to speed up neural network inferences.\nCorrespondingly, we present a compact sparse format. The proposed set of sparse\npatterns, along with a novel pruning methodology, address the load imbalance\nissue and result in models with quality close to unstructured sparse models and\ncomputation efficiency close to structured sparse models. Our experiments show\nthat GS patterns consistently make better trade-offs between accuracy and\ncomputation efficiency compared to conventional structured sparse patterns. GS\npatterns can reduce the runtime of the DNN components by two to three times at\nthe same accuracy levels.

    "abstract": "Databases covering all individuals of a population are increasingly used for\nresearch studies in domains ranging from public health to the social sciences.\nThere is also growing interest by governments and businesses to use population\ndata to support data-driven decision making. The massive size of such databases\nis often mistaken as a guarantee for valid inferences on the population of\ninterest. However, population data have characteristics that make them\nchallenging to use, including various assumptions being made how such data were\ncollected and what types of processing have been applied to them. Furthermore,\nthe full potential of population data can often only be unlocked when such data\nare linked to other databases, a process that adds fresh challenges. This\narticle discusses a diverse range of misconceptions about population data that\nwe believe anybody who works with such data needs to be aware of. Many of these\nmisconceptions are not well documented in scientific publications but only\ndiscussed anecdotally among researchers and practitioners.

    "abstract": "Counting instances of specific subgraphs in a larger graph is an important\nproblem in graph mining. Finding cliques of size k (k-cliques) is one example\nof this NP-hard problem. Different algorithms for clique counting avoid\ncounting the same clique multiple times by pivoting or ordering the graph.\nOrdering-based algorithms include an ordering step to direct the edges in the\ninput graph, and a counting step, which is dominated by building node or\nedge-induced subgraphs. Of the ordering-based algorithms, kClist is the\nstate-of-the art algorithm designed to work on sparse real-world graphs.\nDespite its leading overall performance, kClist's vertex-parallel\nimplementation does not scale well in practice on graphs with a few million\nvertices.\nWe present CITRON (Clique counting with Traffic Reducing Optimizations) to\nimprove the parallel scalability and thus overall performance of clique\ncounting. We accelerate the ordering phase by abandoning kClist's sequential\ncore ordering and using a parallelized degree ordering. We accelerate the\ncounting phase with our reorganized subgraph data structures that reduce memory\ntraffic to improve scaling bottlenecks. Our sorted, compact neighbor lists\nimprove locality and communication efficiency which results in near-linear\nparallel scaling. CITRON significantly outperforms kClist while counting\nmoderately sized cliques, and thus increases the size of graph practical for\nclique counting.\nWe have recently become aware of ArbCount (arXiv:2002.10047), which often\noutperforms us. However, we believe that the analysis included in this paper\nwill be helpful for anyone who wishes to understand the performance\ncharacteristics of k-clique counting.",

We propose a generate-and-validate repair technique, called\nELIXIR designed to be able to generate such patches. ELIXIR aggressively uses\nmethod calls, on par with local variables, fields, or constants, to construct\nmore expressive repair-expressions, that go into synthesizing patches. The\nensuing enlargement of the repair space, on account of the wider use of method\ncalls, is effectively tackled by using a machine-learnt model to rank concrete\nrepairs. The machine-learnt model relies on four features derived from the\nprogram context, i.e., the code surrounding the potential repair location, and\nthe bug report. We implement ELIXIR and evaluate it on two datasets, the\npopular Defects4J dataset and a new dataset Bugs.jar created by us, and against\n2 baseline versions of our technique, and 5 other techniques representing the\nstate of the art in program repair. Our evaluation shows that ELIXIR is able to\nincrease the number of correctly repaired bugs in Defects4J by 85% (from 14 to\n26) and by 57% in Bugs.jar (from 14 to 22), while also significantly\nout-performing other state-of-the-art repair techniques including ACS,\nHD-Repair, NOPOL, PAR, and jGenProg.",

Such falsifications range from\ncheapfakes (e.g., lookalikes or audio dubbing) to deepfakes (e.g.,\nsophisticated AI media synthesis methods), which are becoming perceptually\nindistinguishable from real videos.

    "abstract": "Multi-label image recognition is a fundamental yet practical task because\nreal-world images inherently possess multiple semantic labels. However, it is\ndifficult to collect large-scale multi-label annotations due to the complexity\nof both the input images and output label spaces. To reduce the annotation\ncost, we propose a structured semantic transfer (SST) framework that enables\ntraining multi-label recognition models with partial labels, i.e., merely some\nlabels are known while other labels are missing (also called unknown labels)\nper image. The framework consists of two complementary transfer modules that\nexplore within-image and cross-image semantic correlations to transfer\nknowledge of known labels to generate pseudo labels for unknown labels.\nSpecifically, an intra-image semantic transfer module learns image-specific\nlabel co-occurrence matrix and maps the known labels to complement unknown\nlabels based on this matrix. Meanwhile, a cross-image transfer module learns\ncategory-specific feature similarities and helps complement unknown labels with\nhigh similarities. Finally, both known and generated labels are used to train\nthe multi-label recognition models. Extensive experiments on the Microsoft\nCOCO, Visual Genome and Pascal VOC datasets show that the proposed SST\nframework obtains superior performance over current state-of-the-art\nalgorithms.

Moreover,\npractical scenarios in the industry, impose restrictions, based on logistics\nand preference, on the manner in which the experiments can be conducted. For\nexample, material supply may enable only a handful of experiments in a\nsingle-shot or in the case of computational models one may face significant\nwait-time based on shared computational resources. In such scenarios, one\nusually resorts to performing experiments in a manner that allows for\nmaximizing one's state-of-knowledge while satisfying the above mentioned\npractical constraints. Sequential design of experiments (SDOE) is a popular\nsuite of methods, that has yielded promising results in recent years across\ndifferent engineering and practical problems. A common strategy, that leverages\nBayesian formalism is the Bayesian SDOE, which usually works best in the\none-step-ahead or myopic scenario of selecting a single experiment at each step\nof a sequence of experiments. In this work, we aim to extend the SDOE strategy,\nto query the experiment or computer code at a batch of inputs. To this end, we\nleverage deep reinforcement learning (RL) based policy gradient methods, to\npropose batches of queries that are selected taking into account entire budget\nin hand. The algorithm retains the sequential nature, inherent in the SDOE,\nwhile incorporating elements of reward based on task from the domain of deep\nRL.

    "abstract": "The vigorous developments of Internet of Things make it possible to extend\nits computing and storage capabilities to computing tasks in the aerial system\nwith collaboration of cloud and edge, especially for artificial intelligence\n(AI) tasks based on deep learning (DL). Collecting a large amount of\nimage/video data, Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can only handover intelligent\nanalysis tasks to the back-end mobile edge computing (MEC) server due to their\nlimited storage and computing capabilities. How to efficiently transmit the\nmost correlated information for the AI model is a challenging topic. Inspired\nby the task-oriented communication in recent years, we propose a new aerial\nimage transmission paradigm for the scene classification task. A lightweight\nmodel is developed on the front-end UAV for semantic blocks transmission with\nperception of images and channel conditions. In order to achieve the tradeoff\nbetween transmission latency and classification accuracy, deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) is used to explore the semantic blocks which have the best\ncontribution to the back-end classifier under various channel conditions.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve\nclassification accuracy compared to the fixed transmission strategy and\ntraditional content perception methods.",

    "abstract": "Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are well proved to\nbe capable to provide operating reserve for power systems. As a type of\nlarge-capacity and energy-efficient HVAC system (up to 100 MW), district\ncooling system (DCS) is emerging in modern cities and has huge potential to be\nregulated as a flexible load. However, strategically controlling a DCS to\nprovide flexibility is challenging, because one DCS services multiple buildings\nwith complex thermal dynamics and uncertain cooling demands. Improper control\nmay lead to significant thermal discomfort and even deteriorate the power\nsystem's operation security. To address the above issues, we propose a\nmodel-free control strategy based on the deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nwithout the requirement of accurate system model and uncertainty distribution.\nTo avoid damaging \"trial & error\" actions that may violate the system's\noperation security during the training process, we further propose a safe layer\ncombined to the DRL to guarantee the satisfaction of critical constraints,\nforming a safe-DRL scheme. Moreover, after providing operating reserve, DCS\nincreases power and tries to recover all the buildings' temperature back to set\nvalues, which may probably cause an instantaneous peak-power rebound and bring\na secondary impact on power systems. Therefore, we design a self-adaption\nreward function within the proposed safe-DRL scheme to constrain the peak-power\neffectively. Numerical studies based on a realistic DCS demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed methods.",

    "abstract": "InfoMap is a popular approach for detecting densely connected \"communities\"\nof nodes in networks. To detect such communities, it builds on the standard\ntype of Markov chain and ideas from information theory. Motivated by the\ndynamics of disease spread on networks, whose nodes may have heterogeneous\ndisease-removal rates, we extend InfoMap to absorbing random walks. To do this,\nwe use absorption-scaled graphs, in which the edge weights are scaled according\nto the absorption rates, along with Markov time sweeping. One of our extensions\nof InfoMap converges to the standard version of InfoMap in the limit in which\nthe absorption rates approach $0$. We find that the community structure that\none detects using our extensions of InfoMap can differ markedly from the\ncommunity structure that one detects using methods that do not take\nnode-absorption rates into account. Additionally, we demonstrate that the\ncommunity structure that is induced by local dynamics can have important\nimplications for susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) dynamics on ring-lattice\nnetworks. For example, we find situations in which the outbreak duration is\nmaximized when a moderate number of nodes have large node-absorption rates. We\nalso use our extensions of InfoMap to study community structure in a\nsexual-contact network. We consider the community structure that corresponds to\ndifferent absorption rates for homeless individuals in the network and the\nassociated impact on syphilis dynamics on the network. We observe that the\nfinal outbreak size can be smaller when treatment rates are lower in the\nhomeless population than in other populations than when they are the same in\nall populations.",

In an effort to synthesize high-quality\nvideos, various studies attempted to learn a mapping function between noise and\nvideos, including recent efforts to separate motion distribution and appearance\ndistribution. Previous methods, however, learn motion dynamics in discretized,\nfixed-interval timesteps, which is contrary to the continuous nature of motion\nof a physical body. In this paper, we propose a novel video generation approach\nthat learns separate distributions for motion and appearance, the former\nmodeled by neural ODE to learn natural motion dynamics. Specifically, we employ\na two-stage approach where the first stage converts a noise vector to a\nsequence of keypoints in arbitrary frame rates, and the second stage\nsynthesizes videos based on the given keypoints sequence and the appearance\nnoise vector. Our model not only quantitatively outperforms recent baselines\nfor video generation, but also demonstrates versatile functionality such as\ndynamic frame rate manipulation and motion transfer between two datasets, thus\nopening new doors to diverse video generation applications.",

In the considered model, the\ntransmitter first learns a nonlinear analysis transform to map the source data\ninto latent space, then transmits the latent representation to the receiver via\ndeep joint source-channel coding. Our model incorporates the nonlinear\ntransform as a strong prior to effectively extract the source semantic features\nand provide side information for source-channel coding. Unlike existing\nconventional deep joint source-channel coding methods, the proposed NTSCC\nessentially learns both the source latent representation and an entropy model\nas the prior on the latent representation. Accordingly, novel adaptive rate\ntransmission and hyperprior-aided codec refinement mechanisms are developed to\nupgrade deep joint source-channel coding. The whole system design is formulated\nas an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the end-to-end\ntransmission rate-distortion performance under established perceptual quality\nmetrics. Across simple example sources and test image sources, we find that the\nproposed NTSCC transmission method generally outperforms both the analog\ntransmission using the standard deep joint source-channel coding and the\nclassical separation-based digital transmission.

Although identifying the least congested dominating set\nis NP-hard, we present an algorithm that finds one with approximately minimum\ncongestion.\nIn the second setting, we consider the problem of \"balanced neighborhood\npartitioning\": given an $r$-dominating set, find the partition which assigns\neach vertex to one of its closest dominators and achieves the \"most balanced\"\npiece sizes. We consider the variant which minimizes the variance of piece\nsizes, and show that it is NP-hard iff $r$ is greater than $1$. We design and\nanalyze several algorithms, including a polynomial-time approach which is exact\nwhen $r=1$ (and heuristic otherwise).\nWe complement our theoretical results with extensive computational\nexperiments on a corpus of real-world networks showing that sparse dominating\nsets lead to more balanced neighborhood partitionings.

Given the triplet training corpus $\\langle speech,\ntranscription, translation\\rangle$, the conventional high-quality E2E-ST system\nleverages the $\\langle speech, transcription\\rangle$ pair to pre-train the\nmodel and then utilizes the $\\langle speech, translation\\rangle$ pair to\noptimize it further. However, this process only involves two-tuple data at each\nstage, and this loose coupling fails to fully exploit the association between\ntriplet data. In this paper, we attempt to model the joint probability of\ntranscription and translation based on the speech input to directly leverage\nsuch triplet data. Based on that, we propose a novel regularization method for\nmodel training to improve the agreement of dual-path decomposition within\ntriplet data, which should be equal in theory. To achieve this goal, we\nintroduce two Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization terms into the model\ntraining objective to reduce the mismatch between output probabilities of\ndual-path. Then the well-trained model can be naturally transformed as the\nE2E-ST models by the pre-defined early stop tag.

Inspired by this, we propose a novel\nExpansion-Squeeze-Excitation Fusion Network (ESE-FN) to effectively address the\nproblem of elderly activity recognition, which learns modal and channel-wise\nExpansion-Squeeze-Excitation (ESE) attentions for attentively fusing the\nmulti-modal features in the modal and channel-wise ways. Furthermore, we design\na new Multi-modal Loss (ML) to keep the consistency between the single-modal\nfeatures and the fused multi-modal features by adding the penalty of difference\nbetween the minimum prediction losses on single modalities and the prediction\nloss on the fused modality. Finally, we conduct experiments on a largest-scale\nelderly activity dataset, i.e., ETRI-Activity3D (including 110,000+ videos, and\n50+ categories), to demonstrate that the proposed ESE-FN achieves the best\naccuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, more\nextensive experimental results show that the proposed ESE-FN is also comparable\nto the other methods in terms of normal action recognition task.",

These types of\nmatters are divided into non-blind and blind problems. The second type of\nproblem is more complex in terms of calculations than the first problems due to\nthe unknown of original image and point spread function estimation. In the\npresent paper, an algorithm based on coarse-to-fine iterative by $l_0-\\alpha\nl_1$ regularization and framelet transform is introduced to approximate the\nspread function estimation. Framelet transfer improves the restored kernel due\nto the decomposition of the kernel to different frequencies.

    "abstract": "Mid-air interaction is one of the promising interaction modalities in virtual\nreality (VR) due to its merits in naturalness and intuitiveness, but the\ninteraction suffers from the lack of haptic feedback as no force or\nvibrotactile feedback can be provided in mid-air. As a breakthrough to\ncompensate for this insufficiency, the application of pseudo-haptic features\nwhich create the visuo-haptic illusion without actual physical haptic stimulus\ncan be explored. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of four\npseudo-haptic features: proximity feedback, protrusion, hit effect, and\npenetration blocking on user experience for free-hand mid-air button\ninteraction in VR. We conducted a user study on 21 young subjects to collect\nuser ratings on various aspects of user experience while users were freely\ninteracting with 16 buttons with different combinations of four features.\nResults indicated that all investigated features significantly improved user\nexperience in terms of haptic illusion, embodiment, sense of reality,\nspatiotemporal perception, satisfaction, and hedonic quality. In addition,\nprotrusion and hit effect were more beneficial in comparison with the other two\nfeatures. It is recommended to utilize the four proposed pseudo-haptic features\nin 3D user interfaces (UIs) to make users feel more pleased and amused, but\ncaution is needed when using proximity feedback together with other features.\nThe findings of this study could be helpful for VR developers and UI designers\nin providing better interactive buttons in the 3D interfaces.",

While Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) have been the dominant architectures for such tasks, recently introduced\nVision Transformers (ViTs) aim to replace them as a backbone. Similar to CNNs,\nViTs build a simple multi-stage structure (i.e., fine-to-coarse) for\nmulti-scale representation with single-scale patches. In this work, with a\ndifferent perspective from existing Transformers, we explore multi-scale patch\nembedding and multi-path structure, constructing the Multi-Path Vision\nTransformer (MPViT). MPViT embeds features of the same size~(i.e., sequence\nlength) with patches of different scales simultaneously by using overlapping\nconvolutional patch embedding. Tokens of different scales are then\nindependently fed into the Transformer encoders via multiple paths and the\nresulting features are aggregated, enabling both fine and coarse feature\nrepresentations at the same feature level. Thanks to the diverse, multi-scale\nfeature representations, our MPViTs scaling from tiny~(5M) to base~(73M)\nconsistently achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art Vision\nTransformers on ImageNet classification, object detection, instance\nsegmentation, and semantic segmentation. These extensive results demonstrate\nthat MPViT can serve as a versatile backbone network for various vision tasks.\nCode will be made publicly available at \\url{https://git.io/MPViT}.",

This is the most natural hypergraph\ngeneralization of the highly-studied problem of estimating the number of\ntriangles in a graph stream. Our input is a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ with $n$\nvertices and $m$ hyperedges. A $k$-simplex in $H$ is a subhypergraph on $k+1$\nvertices $X$ such that all $k+1$ possible hyperedges among $X$ exist in $H$.\nThe goal is to process a stream of hyperedges of $H$ and compute a good\nestimate of $T_k(H)$, the number of $k$-simplices in $H$.\nWe design a suite of algorithms for this problem. Under a promise that\n$T_k(H) \\ge T$, our algorithms use at most four passes and together imply a\nspace bound of $O( \\epsilon^{-2} \\log\\delta^{-1} \\text{polylog} n \\cdot \\min\\{\nm^{1+1/k}/T, m/T^{2/(k+1)} \\} )$ for each fixed $k \\ge 3$, in order to\nguarantee an estimate within $(1\\pm\\epsilon)T_k(H)$ with probability at least\n$1-\\delta$. We also give a simpler $1$-pass algorithm that achieves\n$O(\\epsilon^{-2} \\log\\delta^{-1} \\log n\\cdot (m/T) ( \\Delta_E +\n\\Delta_V^{1-1/k} ))$ space, where $\\Delta_E$ (respectively, $\\Delta_V$) denotes\nthe maximum number of $k$-simplices that share a hyperedge (respectively, a\nvertex). We complement these algorithmic results with space lower bounds of the\nform $\\Omega(\\epsilon^{-2})$, $\\Omega(m^{1+1/k}/T)$, $\\Omega(m/T^{1-1/k})$ and\n$\\Omega(m\\Delta_V^{1/k}/T)$ for multi-pass algorithms and $\\Omega(m\\Delta_E/T)$\nfor $1$-pass algorithms, which show that some of the dependencies on parameters\nin our upper bounds are nearly tight.

    "abstract": "Mining data streams poses a number of challenges, including the continuous\nand non-stationary nature of data, the massive volume of information to be\nprocessed and constraints put on the computational resources. While there is a\nnumber of supervised solutions proposed for this problem in the literature,\nmost of them assume that access to the ground truth (in form of class labels)\nis unlimited and such information can be instantly utilized when updating the\nlearning system. This is far from being realistic, as one must consider the\nunderlying cost of acquiring labels. Therefore, solutions that can reduce the\nrequirements for ground truth in streaming scenarios are required. In this\npaper, we propose a novel framework for mining drifting data streams on a\nbudget, by combining information coming from active learning and self-labeling.\nWe introduce several strategies that can take advantage of both intelligent\ninstance selection and semi-supervised procedures, while taking into account\nthe potential presence of concept drift. Such a hybrid approach allows for\nefficient exploration and exploitation of streaming data structures within\nrealistic labeling budgets. Since our framework works as a wrapper, it may be\napplied with different learning algorithms. Experimental study, carried out on\na diverse set of real-world data streams with various types of concept drift,\nproves the usefulness of the proposed strategies when dealing with highly\nlimited access to class labels. The presented hybrid approach is especially\nfeasible when one cannot increase a budget for labeling or replace an\ninefficient classifier.

Existing\nstudies fail to model the effects of unexpected behaviors, thus achieve\ninferior recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a\nMulti-Preferences Model (MPM) to eliminate the effects of unexpected behaviors.\nMPM first extracts the users' instant preferences from their recent historical\ninteractions by a fine-grained preference module.

In\ncomparison with the existing hot-spot account updating solutions deployed\nonline, Maxwell achieves three orders of magnitude performance improvement for\nend-to-end evaluation. Meanwhile, Maxwell also demonstrates remarkable\nperformance gains in other related businesses of Ant Group.",

    "title": "On Cross-Lingual Retrieval with Multilingual Text Encoders",
    "abstract": "In this work we present a systematic empirical study focused on the\nsuitability of the state-of-the-art multilingual encoders for cross-lingual\ndocument and sentence retrieval tasks across a number of diverse language\npairs. We first treat these models as multilingual text encoders and benchmark\ntheir performance in unsupervised ad-hoc sentence- and document-level CLIR. In\ncontrast to supervised language understanding, our results indicate that for\nunsupervised document-level CLIR -- a setup with no relevance judgments for\nIR-specific fine-tuning -- pretrained multilingual encoders on average fail to\nsignificantly outperform earlier models based on CLWEs. For sentence-level\nretrieval, we do obtain state-of-the-art performance: the peak scores, however,\nare met by multilingual encoders that have been further specialized, in a\nsupervised fashion, for sentence understanding tasks, rather than using their\nvanilla 'off-the-shelf' variants. Following these results, we introduce\nlocalized relevance matching for document-level CLIR, where we independently\nscore a query against document sections. In the second part, we evaluate\nmultilingual encoders fine-tuned in a supervised fashion (i.e., we learn to\nrank) on English relevance data in a series of zero-shot language and domain\ntransfer CLIR experiments. Our results show that supervised re-ranking rarely\nimproves the performance of multilingual transformers as unsupervised base\nrankers. Finally, only with in-domain contrastive fine-tuning (i.e., same\ndomain, only language transfer), we manage to improve the ranking quality. We\nuncover substantial empirical differences between cross-lingual retrieval\nresults and results of (zero-shot) cross-lingual transfer for monolingual\nretrieval in target languages, which point to \"monolingual overfitting\" of\nretrieval models trained on monolingual data.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an end-to-end instance segmentation framework, termed\nSOIT, that Segments Objects with Instance-aware Transformers. Inspired by\nDETR~\\cite{carion2020end}, our method views instance segmentation as a direct\nset prediction problem and effectively removes the need for many hand-crafted\ncomponents like RoI cropping, one-to-many label assignment, and non-maximum\nsuppression (NMS). In SOIT, multiple queries are learned to directly reason a\nset of object embeddings of semantic category, bounding-box location, and\npixel-wise mask in parallel under the global image context. The class and\nbounding-box can be easily embedded by a fixed-length vector. The pixel-wise\nmask, especially, is embedded by a group of parameters to construct a\nlightweight instance-aware transformer. Afterward, a full-resolution mask is\nproduced by the instance-aware transformer without involving any RoI-based\noperation. Overall, SOIT introduces a simple single-stage instance segmentation\nframework that is both RoI- and NMS-free. Experimental results on the MS COCO\ndataset demonstrate that SOIT outperforms state-of-the-art instance\nsegmentation approaches significantly. Moreover, the joint learning of multiple\ntasks in a unified query embedding can also substantially improve the detection\nperformance.

To this end, we propose a novel\ngeometry-aware model to learn the transferability and discriminability\nsimultaneously via nuclear norm optimization.

The\ndomain coherence will ensure the model has a larger capacity for learning\nseparable representations, and class orthogonality will minimize the\ncorrelation between clusters to alleviate the misalignment. So, they are\nconsistent and can benefit from each other. Besides, we provide a theoretical\ninsight into the norm-based learning literature in UDA, which ensures the\ninterpretability of our model.

    "abstract": "Merge Resolution (MRes [Beyersdorff et al. J. Autom. Reason.'2021]) is a\nrecently introduced proof system for false QBFs. It stores the countermodels as\nmerge maps. Merge maps are deterministic branching programs in which\nisomorphism checking is efficient making MRes a polynomial time verifiable\nproof system.\nIn this paper, we introduce a family of proof systems MRes-R in which, the\ncountermodels are stored in any pre-fixed complete representation R, instead of\nmerge maps. Hence corresponding to each such R, we have a sound and\nrefutationally complete QBF-proof system in MRes-R. To handle arbitrary\nrepresentations for the strategies, we introduce consistency checking rules in\nMRes-R instead of isomorphism checking. As a result these proof systems are not\npolynomial time verifiable. Consequently, the paper shows that using merge maps\nis too restrictive and can be replaced with arbitrary representations leading\nto several interesting proof systems.\nExploring proof theoretic properties of MRes-R, we show that\neFrege+$\\forall$red simulates all valid refutations from proof systems in\nMRes-R. In order to simulate arbitrary representations in MRes-R, we first\nrepresent the steps used by the proof systems as a new complete structure.\nConsequently, the corresponding proof system belonging to MRes-R is able to\nsimulate all proof systems in MRes-R. Finally, we simulate this proof system\nvia eFrege+$\\forall$red using the ideas from [Chew et al.

    "abstract": "Coflow is a recently proposed networking abstraction to help improve the\ncommunication performance of data-parallel computing jobs. In multi-stage jobs,\neach job consists of multiple coflows and is represented by a Directed Acyclic\nGraph (DAG). Efficiently scheduling coflows is critical to improve the\ndata-parallel computing performance in data centers. Compared with hand-tuned\nscheduling heuristics, existing work DeepWeave [1] utilizes Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) framework to generate highly-efficient coflow scheduling policies\nautomatically. It employs a graph neural network (GNN) to encode the job\ninformation in a set of embedding vectors, and feeds a flat embedding vector\ncontaining the whole job information to the policy network. However, this\nmethod has poor scalability as it is unable to cope with jobs represented by\nDAGs of arbitrary sizes and shapes, which requires a large policy network for\nprocessing a high-dimensional embedding vector that is difficult to train. In\nthis paper, we first utilize a directed acyclic graph neural network (DAGNN) to\nprocess the input and propose a novel Pipelined-DAGNN, which can effectively\nspeed up the feature extraction process of the DAGNN. Next, we feed the\nembedding sequence composed of schedulable coflows instead of a flat embedding\nof all coflows to the policy network, and output a priority sequence, which\nmakes the size of the policy network depend on only the dimension of features\ninstead of the product of dimension and number of nodes in the job's\nDAG.Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of the priority scheduling policy, we\nincorporate the Self-Attention Mechanism into a deep RL model to capture the\ninteraction between different parts of the embedding sequence to make the\noutput priority scores relevant. Based on this model, we then develop a coflow\nscheduling algorithm for online multi-stage jobs.",

This\npaper aims to describe an online programming system for noncontact fillet\nwelding robots with U and L shaped structures, which responds to the needs of\nthe Fourth Industrial Revolution. In this paper, the authors propose an online\nrobot programming methodology that eliminates unnecessary steps traditionally\nperformed in robotic welding, so that the operator only performs three steps to\ncomplete the welding task. First, choose the piece to weld. Then, enter the\nwelding parameters. Finally, it sends the automatically generated program to\nthe robot.

For this, a reduced number of components was used compared to other\nsystems, such as, a structured light 3D camera, two computers and a\nconcentrator, in addition to the six axis industrial robotic arm. The operating\ncomplexity of the system has been reduced as much as possible. To the best of\nthe authors knowledge, there is no scientific or commercial evidence of an\nonline robot programming system capable of performing a fillet welding process,\nsimplifying the process so that it is completely transparent for the operator\nand framed in the Industry 4.0 paradigm.

    "abstract": "The operational semantics of a programming language is said to be small-step\nif each transition step is an atomic computation step in the language. A\nsemantics with this property faithfully corresponds to the implementation of\nthe language. The previous semantics of the graph programming language GP 2 is\nnot fully small-step because the loop and branching commands are defined in\nbig-step style. In this paper, we present a truly small-step operational\nsemantics for GP 2 which, in particular, accurately models diverging\ncomputations. To obtain small-step definitions of all commands, we equip the\ntransition relation with a stack of host graphs and associated operations. We\nprove that the new semantics is non-blocking in that every computation either\ndiverges or eventually produces a result graph or the failure state. We also\nshow the finite nondeterminism property, viz. that each configuration has only\na finite number of direct successors. The previous semantics of GP 2 is neither\nnon-blocking nor does it have the finite nondeterminism property. We also show\nthat, for a program and a graph that terminate, both semantics are equivalent,\nand that the old semantics can be simulated with the new one.",

    "abstract": "Compared to convolutional layers, fully-connected (FC) layers are better at\nmodeling the long-range dependencies but worse at capturing the local patterns,\nhence usually less favored for image recognition. In this paper, we propose a\nmethodology, Locality Injection, to incorporate local priors into an FC layer\nvia merging the trained parameters of a parallel conv kernel into the FC\nkernel. Locality Injection can be viewed as a novel Structural\nRe-parameterization method since it equivalently converts the structures via\ntransforming the parameters. Based on that, we propose a multi-layer-perceptron\n(MLP) block named RepMLP Block, which uses three FC layers to extract features,\nand a novel architecture named RepMLPNet. The hierarchical design distinguishes\nRepMLPNet from the other concurrently proposed vision MLPs. As it produces\nfeature maps of different levels, it qualifies as a backbone model for\ndownstream tasks like semantic segmentation. Our results reveal that 1)\nLocality Injection is a general methodology for MLP models; 2) RepMLPNet has\nfavorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared to the other MLPs; 3)\nRepMLPNet is the first MLP that seamlessly transfer to Cityscapes semantic\nsegmentation.

    "abstract": "Recently, fusing the LiDAR point cloud and camera image to improve the\nperformance and robustness of 3D object detection has received more and more\nattention, as these two modalities naturally possess strong complementarity. In\nthis paper, we propose EPNet++ for multi-modal 3D object detection by\nintroducing a novel Cascade Bi-directional Fusion~(CB-Fusion) module and a\nMulti-Modal Consistency~(MC) loss. More concretely, the proposed CB-Fusion\nmodule boosts the plentiful semantic information of point features with the\nimage features in a cascade bi-directional interaction fusion manner, leading\nto more comprehensive and discriminative feature representations. The MC loss\nexplicitly guarantees the consistency between predicted scores from two\nmodalities to obtain more comprehensive and reliable confidence scores. The\nexperiment results on the KITTI, JRDB and SUN-RGBD datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of EPNet++ over the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, we emphasize\na critical but easily overlooked problem, which is to explore the performance\nand robustness of a 3D detector in a sparser scene. Extensive experiments\npresent that EPNet++ outperforms the existing SOTA methods with remarkable\nmargins in highly sparse point cloud cases, which might be an available\ndirection to reduce the expensive cost of LiDAR sensors.

Beyond their\nability to help software professionals write more accurate, reusable code, they\ncould make programming accessible for a whole new class of non-technical users.\nHowever, non-technical users have been slow to embrace these tools.

SAC is demonstrated to perform very well in a list of continous\ncontrol tasks with good stability and robustness. SAC learns a stochastic\nGaussian policy that can maximize a trade-off between total expected reward and\nthe policy entropy.

To aid\nengineering and computing educators, we share the design and implementation of\nan open-source toolset for logging commands that students execute on Linux\nmachines. Compared to basic solutions, such as shell history files, the\ntoolset's added value is threefold. 1) Its configuration is automated so that\nit can be easily used in classes on different topics. 2) It collects metadata\nabout the command execution, such as a timestamp, hostname, and IP address. 3)\nData are instantly forwarded to central storage in a unified, semi-structured\nformat.

    "abstract": "Even though the TCP/IP architecture has served the Internet quite\nsatisfactorily during its more than forty years of lifespan, there are doubts\nabout whether this host-centric paradigm is well suited for the communication\npatterns of modern applications. These applications mainly need to get\ninformation pieces without being bothered about where they are located in the\nnetwork. Additionally, the lack of both in-built security mechanisms and proper\nglobal multicast support may also be a symptom of fundamental problems with the\nclassic architecture. Proponents of the novel Information Centric Networking\n(ICN) paradigm assert that the replacement of the TCP/IP architecture with one\nbased on the information itself could be the ideal solution to all these\nproblems. However, if such a replacement ever takes place, it will need the\nhelp of some transition mechanisms, for instance, for the transmission of\nlegacy IP traffic on top of the new ICN based networks. In this paper we design\nand optimize such an open source IP over ICN transition application using the\nNamed Data Networking (NDN) proposal as our target ICN network.

Our approach\nfirst locates tree stems from raw point clouds and then matches the stems based\non their relative spatial relationship to determine the registration\ntransformation. In contrast to existing methods, our algorithm requires no\nextra individual tree attributes and has linear complexity to the number of\ntrees in the environment, allowing it to align point clouds of large forest\nenvironments. Extensive experiments have revealed that our method is superior\nto the state-of-the-art methods regarding registration accuracy and robustness,\nand it significantly outperforms existing techniques in terms of efficiency.\nBesides, we introduce a new benchmark dataset that complements the very few\nexisting open datasets for the development and evaluation of registration\nmethods for forest point clouds.",

    "abstract": "Melody harmonization, namely generating a chord progression for a user-given\nmelody, remains a challenging task to this day. Although previous neural\nnetwork-based systems can effectively generate an appropriate chord progression\nfor a melody, few studies focus on controllable melody harmonization, and none\nof them can generate flexible harmonic rhythms. To achieve harmonic\nrhythm-controllable melody harmonization, we propose AutoHarmonizer, a neural\nnetwork-based melody harmonization system that can generate denser or sparser\nchord progressions with the use of a new sampling method for controllable\ngeneration proposed in this paper. This system mainly consists of two parts: a\nharmonic rhythm model provides coarse-grained chord onset information, while a\nchord model generates specific pitches for chords based on the given melody and\nthe corresponding harmonic rhythm sequence previously generated. To evaluate\nthe performance of AutoHarmonizer, we use nine metrics to compare the chord\nprogressions from humans, the system proposed in this paper and the baseline.\nExperimental results show that AutoHarmonizer not only generates harmonic\nrhythms comparable to the human level, but generates chords with overall better\nquality than baseline at different settings. In addition, we use AutoHarmonizer\nto harmonize the Session Dataset (which were originally chordless), and ended\nwith 40,925 traditional Irish folk songs with harmonies, named the Session Lead\nSheet Dataset, which is the largest lead sheet dataset to date.",

Instead of directly extracting representative features using\nexpert-designed descriptors or end-to-end deep neural networks, this paper is\ndedicated to discovering distinctive information from the shape formation\nprocess. Concretely, a spherical point cloud served as the template is\nprogressively deformed to fit the target shape in a coarse-to-fine manner.\nDuring the shape formation process, several checkpoints are inserted to\nfacilitate recording and investigating the intermediate stages. For each stage,\nthe offset field is evaluated as a stage-aware description. The summation of\nthe offsets throughout the shape formation process can completely define the\ntarget shape in terms of geometry. In this perspective, one can derive the\npoint-wise shape correspondence from the template inexpensively, which benefits\nvarious graphic applications. In this paper, the Progressive Deformation-based\nAuto-Encoder (PDAE) is proposed to learn the stage-aware description through a\ncoarse-to-fine shape fitting task.

First, the FedPOIRec framework is built on the principle that\nlocal data never leave the owner's device, while the local updates are blindly\naggregated by a parameter server. Second, the local recommenders get\npersonalized by allowing users to exchange their learned parameters, enabling\nknowledge transfer among friends. To this end, we propose a privacy preserving\nprotocol for integrating the preferences of a user's friends after the\nfederated computation, by exploiting the properties of the CKKS fully\nhomomorphic encryption scheme. To evaluate FedPOIRec, we apply our approach\ninto five real-world datasets using two recommendation models.

Unfortunately, the\neffectiveness of such models may fail when there are insufficient data. To\nhandle this issue, researchers often adopt exploration strategies to examine\nitems based on the estimated reward, e.g., UCB or Thompson Sampling. In the\ncontext of Exploitation-and-Exploration for CTR prediction, recent studies have\nattempted to utilize the prediction uncertainty along with model prediction as\nthe reward score.

Due to the lack of using clean\nphase information, the enhancement performance is limited in most SSL methods.\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose a phase-aware self-supervised learning\nbased monaural speech enhancement method. The latent representations of both\namplitude and phase are studied in two decoders of the foundation autoencoder\n(FAE) with only a limited set of clean speech signals independently. Then, the\ndownstream autoencoder (DAE) learns a shared latent space between the clean\nspeech and mixture representations with a large number of unseen mixtures. A\ncomplex-cycle-consistent (CCC) mechanism is proposed to minimize the\nreconstruction loss between the amplitude and phase domains. Besides, it is\nnoticed that if the speech features are extracted as the multi-resolution\nspectra, the desired information distributed in spectra of different scales can\nbe studied to further boost the performance. The NOISEX and DAPS corpora are\nused to generate mixtures with different interferences to evaluate the efficacy\nof the proposed method.

For images with partially invisible limbs, PONet estimates the 3D\norientation of these limbs by taking advantage of the local image evidence to\nrecover the 3D pose.Moreover, PONet is competent to infer full 3D poses even\nfrom images with completely invisible limbs, by exploiting the orientation\ncorrelation between visible limbs to complement the estimated poses,further\nimproving the robustness of 3D pose estimation.We evaluate our method on\nmultiple datasets, including Human3.6M, MPII, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. Our\nmethod achieves results on par with state-of-the-art techniques in ideal\nsettings, yet significantly eliminates the dependency on keypoint detectors and\nthe corresponding computation burden.

Solutions based on deep learning that deliver\nstate-of-the-art CTS forecasting performance employ a variety of\nspatio-temporal (ST) blocks that are able to model temporal dependencies and\nspatial correlations among time series. However, two challenges remain. First,\nST-blocks are designed manually, which is time consuming and costly. Second,\nexisting forecasting models simply stack the same ST-blocks multiple times,\nwhich limits the model potential. To address these challenges, we propose\nAutoCTS that is able to automatically identify highly competitive ST-blocks as\nwell as forecasting models with heterogeneous ST-blocks connected using diverse\ntopologies, as opposed to the same ST-blocks connected using simple stacking.\nSpecifically, we design both a micro and a macro search space to model possible\narchitectures of ST-blocks and the connections among heterogeneous ST-blocks,\nand we provide a search strategy that is able to jointly explore the search\nspaces to identify optimal forecasting models.

We\nbenchmark the proposed algorithm against two known solutions, namely a minimum\nmean-square error based AO algorithm and an inner approximation method with\nblock coordinate descent. Specifically, the complexity of the proposed\nalgorithm is $O(N_I^2)$ while that of the two benchmark methods is $O(N_I^3)$,\nwhere $N_I$ is the number of IRS elements. Moreover, numerical results show\nthat the proposed PDDGP algorithm yields considerably higher achievable rate\nthan the benchmark solutions.",

The challenge has been that a proof is only considered direct if it\ndoes not rely on reductio ad absurdum. Thus, any proof that claims to be direct\nmust show, going back to the axioms, that all of the auxiliary theorems used\nare also proved directly. In this paper, we give a proof of the Steiner-Lehmus\ntheorem that is guaranteed to be direct. The evidence for this claim is derived\nfrom our methodology: we have formalized a constructive axiom set for Euclidean\nplane geometry in a proof assistant that implements a constructive logic and\nhave built the proof of the Steiner-Lehmus theorem on this constructive\nfoundation.",

On the one hand, this\ntechnology provides a suitable platform that facilitates the registration of\ninformation and access to them to help make decisions and allows concurrent\ntraining for the user while executing the production processes. This leads to\nincreased work speed and accuracy of the user as a process operator and\nconsequently offers economic benefits to the companies. Moreover, recent\nadvances in the internet of things, smart sensors, and advanced algorithms have\nincreased the possibility of widespread and more effective use of augmented\nreality. Currently, many research pieces are being done to expand the\napplication of augmented reality and increase its effectiveness in industrial\nproduction processes. This research demonstrates the influence of augmented\nreality in Industry 4.0 while critically reviewing the industrial augmented\nreality history. Afterward, the paper discusses the critical role of industrial\naugmented reality by analyzing some use cases and their prospects. With a\nsystematic analysis, this paper discusses the main future directions for\nindustrial augmented reality applications in industry 4.0.

    "abstract": "In 2019, the UK's Immigration and Asylum Chamber of the Upper Tribunal\ndismissed an asylum appeal basing the decision on the output of a biometric\nsystem, alongside other discrepancies. The fingerprints of the asylum seeker\nwere found in a biometric database which contradicted the appellant's account.\nThe Tribunal found this evidence unequivocal and denied the asylum claim.\nNowadays, the proliferation of biometric systems is shaping public debates\naround its political, social and ethical implications. Yet whilst concerns\ntowards the racialised use of this technology for migration control have been\non the rise, investment in the biometrics industry and innovation is increasing\nconsiderably. Moreover, fairness has also been recently adopted by biometrics\nto mitigate bias and discrimination on biometrics. However, algorithmic\nfairness cannot distribute justice in scenarios which are broken or intended\npurpose is to discriminate, such as biometrics deployed at the border.\nIn this paper, we offer a critical reading of recent debates about biometric\nfairness and show its limitations drawing on research in fairness in machine\nlearning and critical border studies. Building on previous fairness\ndemonstrations, we prove that biometric fairness criteria are mathematically\nmutually exclusive. Then, the paper moves on illustrating empirically that a\nfair biometric system is not possible by reproducing experiments from previous\nworks. Finally, we discuss the politics of fairness in biometrics by situating\nthe debate at the border. We claim that bias and error rates have different\nimpact on citizens and asylum seekers. Fairness has overshadowed the elephant\nin the room of biometrics, focusing on the demographic biases and ethical\ndiscourses of algorithms rather than examine how these systems reproduce\nhistorical and political injustices.",

Such areas where mhealth systems have\nbeen extensively deployed include monitoring of long term health conditions\nlike Cardio Vascular Diseases and pulmonary disorders, as well as detection of\nchanges from baseline measurements of such conditions. Asthma is one of the\nrespiratory conditions with growing concern across the globe due to the\neconomic, social and emotional burden associated with the ailment. The\nmanagement and control of asthma can be improved by consistent monitoring of\nthe condition in realtime since attack could occur anytime and anywhere.

The system design\nis based on Decision Support System techniques for measuring and analyzing the\nlevel and type of patients physical activity as well as weather conditions that\npredispose asthma attack. Preliminary results show that smartphones can be used\nto monitor and detect asthma symptoms without other networked devices. This\nwould enhance the usability of the health system while ensuring users data\nprivacy, and reducing the overall cost of system deployment. Further, the\nproposed system can serve as a handy tool for a quick medical response for\nasthmatics in low income countries where there are limited access to\nspecialized medical devices and shortages of health professionals.

Therefore, modeling long-range contextual\nemotional relationships with speaker dependency plays a crucial part in\ndialogue emotion recognition. Meanwhile, distinguishing the different emotion\ncategories is non-trivial since they usually have semantically similar\nsentiments. To this end, we adopt supervised contrastive learning to make\ndifferent emotions mutually exclusive to identify similar emotions better.\nMeanwhile, we utilize an auxiliary response generation task to enhance the\nmodel's ability of handling context information, thereby forcing the model to\nrecognize emotions with similar semantics in diverse contexts. To achieve these\nobjectives, we use the pre-trained encoder-decoder model BART as our backbone\nmodel since it is very suitable for both understanding and generation tasks.\nThe experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our proposed model obtains\nsignificantly more favorable results than the state-of-the-art model in\ndialogue emotion recognition.

    "abstract": "Cities have become primary actors on climate change and are increasingly\nsetting goals aimed at net-zero emissions. The rapid proliferation of\nsubnational governments \"racing to zero\" emissions and articulating their own\nclimate mitigation plans warrants closer examination to understand how these\nactors intend to meet these goals. The scattered, incomplete and heterogeneous\nnature of city climate policy documents, however, has made their systemic\nanalysis challenging. We analyze 318 climate action documents from cities that\nhave pledged net-zero targets or joined a transnational climate initiative with\nthis goal using machine learning-based natural language processing (NLP)\ntechniques. We use these approaches to accomplish two primary goals: 1)\ndetermine text patterns that predict \"ambitious\" net-zero targets, where we\ndefine an ambitious target as one that encompasses a subnational government's\neconomy-wide emissions; and 2) perform a sectoral analysis to identify patterns\nand trade-offs in climate action themes (i.e., land-use, industry, buildings,\netc.). We find that cities that have defined ambitious climate actions tend to\nemphasize quantitative metrics and specific high-emitting sectors in their\nplans, supported by mentions of governance and citizen participation. Cities\npredominantly emphasize energy-related actions in their plans, particularly in\nthe buildings, transport and heating sectors, but often at the expense of other\nsectors, including land-use and climate impacts. The method presented in this\npaper provides a replicable, scalable approach to analyzing climate action\nplans and a first step towards facilitating cross-city learning.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent Tutoring Systems have become critically important in future\nlearning environments. Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a crucial part of that system.\nIt is about inferring the skill mastery of students and predicting their\nperformance to adjust the curriculum accordingly. Deep Learning-based KT models\nhave shown significant predictive performance compared with traditional models.\nHowever, it is difficult to extract psychologically meaningful explanations\nfrom the tens of thousands of parameters in neural networks, that would relate\nto cognitive theory. There are several ways to achieve high accuracy in student\nperformance prediction but diagnostic and prognostic reasoning is more critical\nin learning sciences. Since KT problem has few observable features (problem ID\nand student's correctness at each practice), we extract meaningful latent\nfeatures from students' response data by using machine learning and data mining\ntechniques. In this work, we present Interpretable Knowledge Tracing (IKT), a\nsimple model that relies on three meaningful latent features: individual skill\nmastery, ability profile (learning transfer across skills), and problem\ndifficulty. IKT's prediction of future student performance is made using a\nTree-Augmented Naive Bayes Classifier (TAN), therefore its predictions are\neasier to explain than deep learning-based student models. IKT also shows\nbetter student performance prediction than deep learning-based student models\nwithout requiring a huge amount of parameters. We conduct ablation studies on\neach feature to examine their contribution to student performance prediction.\nThus, IKT has great potential for providing adaptive and personalized\ninstructions with causal reasoning in real-world educational systems.",

In this work, we\ndevelop machine learning (ML) models that can use in-situ thermographic data to\npredict the microporosity of LPBF stainless steel materials. This work\nconsiders two identified key features from the thermal histories: the time\nabove the apparent melting threshold (/tau) and the maximum radiance (T_{max}).\nThese features are computed, stored for each voxel in the built material, are\nused as inputs. The binary state of each voxel, either defective or normal, is\nthe output. Different ML models are trained and tested for the binary\nclassification task. In addition to using the thermal features of each voxel to\npredict its own state, the thermal features of neighboring voxels are also\nincluded as inputs. This is shown to improve the prediction accuracy, which is\nconsistent with thermal transport physics around each voxel contributing to its\nfinal state. Among the models trained, the F1 scores on test sets reach above\n0.96 for random forests.

However, existing actor-critic methods suffer more or less\nfrom underestimation bias or overestimation bias, which negatively affect their\nperformance. In this paper, we reveal a simple but effective principle: proper\nvalue correction benefits bias alleviation, where we propose the\ngeneralized-activated weighting operator that uses any non-decreasing function,\nnamely activation function, as weights for better value estimation.\nParticularly, we integrate the generalized-activated weighting operator into\nvalue estimation and introduce a novel algorithm, Generalized-activated Deep\nDouble Deterministic Policy Gradients (GD3). We theoretically show that GD3 is\ncapable of alleviating the potential estimation bias. We interestingly find\nthat simple activation functions lead to satisfying performance with no\nadditional tricks, and could contribute to faster convergence. Experimental\nresults on numerous challenging continuous control tasks show that GD3 with\ntask-specific activation outperforms the common baseline methods. We also\nuncover a fact that fine-tuning the polynomial activation function achieves\nsuperior results on most of the tasks.",

    "abstract": "Recently, barrier function-based safe reinforcement learning (RL) with the\nactor-critic structure for continuous control tasks has received increasing\nattention. It is still challenging to learn a near-optimal control policy with\nsafety and convergence guarantees. Also, few works have addressed the safe RL\nalgorithm design under time-varying safety constraints. This paper proposes a\nmodel-based safe RL algorithm for optimal control of nonlinear systems with\ntime-varying state and control constraints. In the proposed approach, we\nconstruct a novel barrier-based control policy structure that can guarantee\ncontrol safety. A multi-step policy evaluation mechanism is proposed to predict\nthe policy's safety risk under time-varying safety constraints and guide the\npolicy to update safely. Theoretical results on stability and robustness are\nproven. Also, the convergence of the actor-critic learning algorithm is\nanalyzed. The performance of the proposed algorithm outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art RL algorithms in the simulated Safety Gym environment.\nFurthermore, the approach is applied to the integrated path following and\ncollision avoidance problem for two real-world intelligent vehicles. A\ndifferential-drive vehicle and an Ackermann-drive one are used to verify the\noffline deployment performance and the online learning performance,\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "As the technological advancement and capabilities of automated systems have\nincreased drastically, the usage of unmanned aerial vehicles for performing\nhuman-dependent tasks without human indulgence has also spiked. Since unmanned\naerial vehicles are heavily dependent on Information and Communication\nTechnology, they are highly prone to cyber-attacks. With time more advanced and\nnew attacks are being developed and employed. However, the current Intrusion\ndetection system lacks detection and classification of new and unknown attacks.\nTherefore, for having an autonomous and reliable operation of unmanned aerial\nvehicles, more robust and automated cyber detection and protection schemes are\nneeded. To address this, we have proposed an autonomous self-incremental\nlearning architecture, capable of detecting known and unknown cyber-attacks on\nits own without any human interference. In our approach, we have combined\nsignature-based detection along with anomaly detection in such a way that the\nsignature-based detector autonomously updates its attack classes with the help\nof an anomaly detector. To achieve this, we have implemented an incremental\nlearning approach, updating our model to incorporate new classes without\nforgetting the old ones. To validate the applicability and effectiveness of our\nproposed architecture, we have implemented it in a trial scenario and then\ncompared it with the traditional offline learning approach.

    "abstract": "With the advent of intelligent jammers, jamming attacks have become a more\nsevere threat to the performance of wireless systems. An intelligent jammer is\nable to change its policy to minimize the probability of being traced by\nlegitimate nodes. Thus, an anti-jamming mechanism capable of constantly\nadjusting to the jamming policy is required to combat such a jammer.\nRemarkably, existing anti-jamming methods are not applicable here because they\nmainly focus on mitigating jamming attacks with an invariant jamming policy,\nand they rarely consider an intelligent jammer as an adversary. Therefore, in\nthis paper, to employ a jamming type recognition technique working alongside an\nanti-jamming technique is proposed. The proposed recognition method employs a\nrecurrent neural network that takes the jammer's occupied channels as inputs\nand outputs the jammer type. Under this scheme, the real-time jammer policy is\nfirst identified, and, then, the most appropriate countermeasure is chosen.\nConsequently, any changes to the jammer policy can be instantly detected with\nthe proposed recognition technique allowing for a rapid switch to a new\nanti-jamming method fitted to the new jamming policy. To evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed recognition method, the accuracy of the detection\nis derived as a function of the jammer policy switching time. Simulation\nresults show the detection accuracy for all the considered users numbers is\ngreater than 70% when the jammer switches its policy every 5 time slots and the\naccuracy raises to 90% when the jammer policy switching time is 45.",

To enhance the\nrobustness, existing approaches focus on recognizing adversarial samples rather\nthan on the valid samples that fall outside a given distribution, which we\nrefer to as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples.

Recent\nadvances in learning algorithms have demonstrated that recurrent networks of\nspiking neurons can be effectively trained to achieve competitive performance\ncompared to standard recurrent neural networks. Still, as these learning\nalgorithms use error-backpropagation through time (BPTT), they suffer from high\nmemory requirements, are slow to train, and are incompatible with online\nlearning. This limits the application of these learning algorithms to\nrelatively small networks and to limited temporal sequence lengths. Online\napproximations to BPTT with lower computational and memory complexity have been\nproposed (e-prop, OSTL), but in practice also suffer from memory limitations\nand, as approximations, do not outperform standard BPTT training. Here, we show\nhow a recently developed alternative to BPTT, Forward Propagation Through Time\n(FPTT) can be applied in spiking neural networks. Different from BPTT, FPTT\nattempts to minimize an ongoing dynamically regularized risk on the loss. As a\nresult, FPTT can be computed in an online fashion and has fixed complexity with\nrespect to the sequence length. When combined with a novel dynamic spiking\nneuron model, the Liquid-Time-Constant neuron, we show that SNNs trained with\nFPTT outperform online BPTT approximations, and approach or exceed offline BPTT\naccuracy on temporal classification tasks.

    "abstract": "Adversarial robustness is one of the most challenging problems in Deep\nLearning and Computer Vision research. All the state-of-the-art techniques\nrequire a time-consuming procedure that creates cleverly perturbed images. Due\nto its cost, many solutions have been proposed to avoid Adversarial Training.\nHowever, all these attempts proved ineffective as the attacker manages to\nexploit spurious correlations among pixels to trigger brittle features\nimplicitly learned by the model. This paper first introduces a new image\nfiltering scheme called Image-Graph Extractor (IGE) that extracts the\nfundamental nodes of an image and their connections through a graph structure.\nBy leveraging the IGE representation, we build a new defense method, Filtering\nAs a Defense, that does not allow the attacker to entangle pixels to create\nmalicious patterns. Moreover, we show that data augmentation with filtered\nimages effectively improves the model's robustness to data corruption. We\nvalidate our techniques on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.",

Optimal strategies rely\non human expertise for field scouting under favourable conditions to assess the\ncurrent presence and extent of disease symptoms. This labor-intensive task is\ncomplicated by the large field area to be scouted, combined with the\nmillimeter-scale size of the early symptoms to be detected. In view of this,\nimage-based detection of early disease symptoms is an attractive approach to\nautomate this process, enabling a potential high throughput monitoring at\nsustainable costs.\nMethods. Deep learning has been successfully applied in various domains to\nobtain an automatic selection of the relevant image features by learning\nfilters via a training procedure. Deep learning has recently entered also the\ndomain of plant disease detection: following this idea, in this work we present\na deep learning approach to automatically recognize powdery mildew on cucumber\nleaves. We focus on unsupervised deep learning techniques applied to\nmultispectral imaging data and we propose the use of autoencoder architectures\nto investigate two strategies for disease detection: i) clusterization of\nfeatures in a compressed space; ii) anomaly detection.\nResults. The two proposed approaches have been assessed by quantitative\nindices. The clusterization approach is not fully capable by itself to provide\naccurate predictions but it does cater relevant information. Anomaly detection\nhas instead a significant potential of resolution which could be further\nexploited as a prior for supervised architectures with a very limited number of\nlabeled samples.",

The gist is to model the distribution of the normal\ndata, while the out-of-distribution sample can be viewed as the outlier. At\nfirst, the variational inference-based anomaly detection methods are\ninvestigated.

However, the number of\nrandomly slicing poses a difficulty to estimate the true distance. In the end,\nwe propose a projected sliced Wasserstein (PSW) autoencoder-based anomaly\nscreening method.

In fair ranking, utility is\ncomplemented with fairness as an optimization goal. Recent work on fair ranking\nfocuses on developing algorithms to optimize for fairness, given position-based\nexposure. In contrast, we identify the potential of outliers in a ranking to\ninfluence exposure and thereby negatively impact fairness. An outlier in a list\nof items can alter the examination probabilities, which can lead to different\ndistributions of attention, compared to position-based exposure. We formalize\noutlierness in a ranking, show that outliers are present in realistic datasets,\nand present the results of an eye-tracking study, showing that users scanning\norder and the exposure of items are influenced by the presence of outliers. We\nthen introduce OMIT, a method for fair ranking in the presence of outliers.\nGiven an outlier detection method, OMIT improves fair allocation of exposure by\nsuppressing outliers in the top-k ranking.

The proposed Three-Output Open Differential is designed\nsuch that its functioning is analogous to the functioning of a traditional\ntwo-output open differential. That is, the differential translates equal motion\nand torque to all its three outputs when the outputs are unconstrained or are\nsubjected to equivalent load conditions. The introduced design is the first\ndifferential with three outputs to realise this outcome. The differential\naction between the three outputs is realised passively by a symmetric\narrangement of three two-output open differentials and three two-input open\ndifferentials. The resulting differential mechanism achieves the novel result\nof equivalent input to output angular velocity and torque relations for all its\nthree outputs. Furthermore, Three-Output Open Differential achieves the novel\nresult for differentials with more than two outputs where each of its outputs\nshares equivalent angular velocity and torque relations with all the other\noutputs. The kinematics and dynamics of the Three-Output Open Differential are\nderived using the bond graph method.

Recent works on the\nconvergence analysis of FL have focused on unbiased client sampling, e.g.,\nsampling uniformly at random, which suffers from slow wall-clock time for\nconvergence due to high degrees of system heterogeneity and statistical\nheterogeneity. This paper aims to design an adaptive client sampling algorithm\nthat tackles both system and statistical heterogeneity to minimize the\nwall-clock convergence time. We obtain a new tractable convergence bound for FL\nalgorithms with arbitrary client sampling probabilities. Based on the bound, we\nanalytically establish the relationship between the total learning time and\nsampling probabilities, which results in a non-convex optimization problem for\ntraining time minimization. We design an efficient algorithm for learning the\nunknown parameters in the convergence bound and develop a low-complexity\nalgorithm to approximately solve the non-convex problem. Experimental results\nfrom both hardware prototype and simulation demonstrate that our proposed\nsampling scheme significantly reduces the convergence time compared to several\nbaseline sampling schemes.

    "abstract": "Completing an unordered partial point cloud is a challenging task. Existing\napproaches that rely on decoding a latent feature to recover the complete\nshape, often lead to the completed point cloud being over-smoothing, losing\ndetails, and noisy. Instead of decoding a whole shape, we propose to decode and\nrefine a low-resolution (low-res) point cloud first, and then performs a\npatch-wise noise-aware upsampling rather than interpolating the whole sparse\npoint cloud at once, which tends to lose details. Regarding the possibility of\nlacking details of the initially decoded low-res point cloud, we propose an\niterative refinement to recover the geometric details and a symmetrization\nprocess to preserve the trustworthy information from the input partial point\ncloud. After obtaining a sparse and complete point cloud, we propose a\npatch-wise upsampling strategy. Patch-based upsampling allows to better recover\nfine details unlike decoding a whole shape, however, the existing upsampling\nmethods are not applicable to completion task due to the data discrepancy\n(i.e., input sparse data here is not from ground-truth). Therefore, we propose\na patch extraction approach to generate training patch pairs between the sparse\nand ground-truth point clouds, and an outlier removal step to suppress the\nnoisy points from the sparse point cloud. Together with the low-res recovery,\nour whole method is able to achieve high-fidelity point cloud completion.\nComprehensive evaluations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method and its individual components.",

    "abstract": "Fairness in decision-making has been a long-standing issue in our society.\nDespite the increasing number of research activities on unfairness mitigation\nin machine learning models, there is little research focusing on mitigating\nunfairness in human decisions. Fairness in human decisions is as important as,\nif not more important than, fairness in machine learning models since there are\nprocesses where humans make the final decisions and machine learning models can\ninherit bias from the human decisions they were trained on. As a result, this\nwork aims to detect unfairness in human decisions, the very first step of\nsolving the unfair human decision problem.\nThis paper proposes to utilize the existing machine learning fairness\ndetection mechanisms to detect unfairness in human decisions. The rationale\nbehind this is, while it is difficult to directly test whether a human makes\nunfair decisions, with current research on machine learning fairness, it is now\neasy to test, on a large scale at a low cost, whether a machine learning model\nis unfair. By synthesizing unfair labels on four general machine learning\nfairness datasets and one image processing dataset, this paper shows that the\nproposed approach is able to detect (1) whether or not unfair labels exist in\nthe training data and (2) the degree and direction of the unfairness. We\nbelieve that this work demonstrates the potential of utilizing machine learning\nfairness to detect human decision fairness. Following this work, research can\nbe conducted on (1) preventing future unfair decisions, (2) fixing prior unfair\ndecisions, and (3) training a fairer machine learning model.",

    "abstract": "With their high energy efficiency, processing-in-memory (PIM) arrays are\nincreasingly used for convolutional neural network (CNN) inference. In\nPIM-based CNN inference, the computational latency and energy are dependent on\nhow the CNN weights are mapped to the PIM array. A recent study proposed\nshifted and duplicated kernel (SDK) mapping that reuses the input feature maps\nwith a unit of a parallel window, which is convolved with duplicated kernels to\nobtain multiple output elements in parallel. However, the existing SDK-based\nmapping algorithm does not always result in the minimum computing cycles\nbecause it only maps a square-shaped parallel window with the entire channels.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel mapping algorithm called variable-window\nSDK (VW-SDK), which adaptively determines the shape of the parallel window that\nleads to the minimum computing cycles for a given convolutional layer and PIM\narray. By allowing rectangular-shaped windows with partial channels, VW-SDK\nutilizes the PIM array more efficiently, thereby further reduces the number of\ncomputing cycles. The simulation with a 512x512 PIM array and Resnet-18 shows\nthat VW-SDK improves the inference speed by 1.69x compared to the existing\nSDK-based algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Significant cost reductions attract ever more households to invest in\nsmall-scale renewable electricity generation and storage. Such distributed\nresources are not used in the most effective way when only used individually,\nas sharing them provides even greater cost-savings. Energy Peer-to-Peer (P2P)\nsystems have been shown to be beneficial for prosumers and consumers through\nreductions in energy cost while being attractive to grid or service provider.\nHowever, many practical challenges have to be overcome before all players could\ngain in having efficient and automated local energy communities, including the\ninherent complexity of matching together geographically distributed peers and\nthe significant computation required to calculate the local matching\npreferences. Hence dedicated algorithms are required to be able to perform a\ncost-efficient matching of thousands of peers in a computational-efficient\nfashion. We define and analyse in this work a precise mathematical modelling of\nthe geographical peer matching problem. We then propose and analyse dedicated\nalgorithms. Our experimental study, based on real-world energy data,\ndemonstrates that our solutions are both efficient in terms of cost-savings\nachieved by the peers and in terms of computing requirements. Previous results\nhave already shown that small communities were efficient but only small-enough\ndatasets were used allowing for brute-force solutions. Our scalable algorithms\nthus provide one core building block on the way to build fully practical and\ndata-efficient peer-to-peer energy sharing communities for large-scale systems.",

To ensure that recourse is robust, individuals are asked\nto make more effort than they would have otherwise had to. In order to shift\npart of the burden of robustness from the decision-subject to the\ndecision-maker, we propose a model regularizer that encourages the additional\ncost of seeking robust recourse to be low.

On the other hand,\ncybersecurity techniques and solutions applied in SATCOM links should be\nupdated to reflect the enormous advancements in attacker capabilities\ncharacterizing the last two decades.

Specifically, we classify the literature on security\nfor SATCOM systems into two main branches, i.e., physical-layer security and\ncryptography schemes. Then, we further identify specific research domains for\neach of the identified branches, focusing on dedicated security issues,\nincluding, e.g., physical-layer confidentiality, anti-jamming schemes,\nanti-spoofing strategies, and quantum-based key distribution schemes. For each\nof the above domains, we highlight the most essential techniques,\npeculiarities, advantages, disadvantages, lessons learned, and future\ndirections.

    "abstract": "In this work we deal with parametric inverse problems, which consist in\nrecovering a finite number of parameters describing the structure of an unknown\nobject, from indirect measurements. State-of-the-art methods for approximating\na regularizing inverse operator by using a dataset of input-output pairs of the\nforward model rely on deep learning techniques. In these approaches, a neural\nnetwork is trained to predict the value of the sought parameters directly from\nthe data. In this paper, we show that these methods provide suboptimal results\nwhen the topology of the parameter space is strictly coarser than the Euclidean\none. To overcome this issue, we propose a two-step strategy for approximating a\nregularizing inverse operator by means of a neural network, which works under\ngeneral topological conditions. First, we embed the parameters into a subspace\nof a low-dimensional Euclidean space; second, we use a neural network to\napproximate a homeomorphism between the subspace and the image of the parameter\nspace through the forward operator. The parameters are then retrieved by\napplying the inverse of the embedding to the network predictions. The results\nare shown for the problem of X-ray imaging of solar flares with data from the\nSpectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays. In this case, the parameter space is\na family of Moebius strips that collapse into a point. Our simulation studies\nshow that the use of a neural network for predicting the parameters directly\nfrom the data yields systematic errors due to the non-Euclidean topology of the\nparameter space.

These steps are performed in a reduced approximation\nspace, while the contact treatment itself can be achieved by the Craig-Bampton\nmethod, which preserves the Lagrange multipliers and the nodal displacements at\nthe contact zone. We think, that if the contact area is small compared to the\noverall structure, the reduction scheme performs very efficiently, since the\ncontact shape is entirely recovered. The performance of the resulting reduction\nmethod is assessed on two 2D computational examples",

Deep learning is also considered as a\npowerful tool with high flexibility to approximate functions.

An efficient and easy\nto implement algorithm is developed to obtain a posteriori error estimate for\nmultiple goal functionals by employing the dual-weighted residual approach,\nwhich is followed by the computation of both primal and adjoint solutions using\nthe neural network. The present study shows that such a data-driven model based\nlearning has superior approximation of quantities of interest even with\nrelatively less training data.

Existing shape\nfrom polarization (SfP) works mainly focus on estimating the normal of a single\nobject rather than complex scenes in the wild. A key barrier to high-quality\nscene-level SfP is the lack of real-world SfP data in complex scenes. Hence, we\ncontribute the first real-world scene-level SfP dataset with paired input\npolarization images and ground-truth normal maps. Then we propose a\nlearning-based framework with a multi-head self-attention module and viewing\nencoding, which is designed to handle increasing polarization ambiguities\ncaused by complex materials and non-orthographic projection in scene-level SfP.\nOur trained model can be generalized to far-field outdoor scenes as the\nrelationship between polarized light and surface normals is not affected by\ndistance.

In addition to estimating a\nparameter for each reporter that is related to their tendency of over- or\nunder-reporting relationships, the model explicitly incorporates a term for\n\"mutuality,\" the tendency to report ties in both directions involving the same\nalter. Our model's algorithmic implementation is based on variational\ninference, which makes it efficient and scalable to large systems. We apply our\nmodel to data from 75 Indian villages collected with a name-generator design,\nand a Nicaraguan community collected with a roster-based design. We observe\nstrong evidence of \"mutuality\" in both datasets, and find that this value\nvaries by relationship type.

    "abstract": "Advances in multi-spectral detectors are causing a paradigm shift in X-ray\nComputed Tomography (CT). Spectral information acquired from these detectors\ncan be used to extract volumetric material composition maps of the object of\ninterest. If the materials and their spectral responses are known a priori, the\nimage reconstruction step is rather straightforward. If they are not known,\nhowever, the maps as well as the responses need to be estimated jointly. A\nconventional workflow in spectral CT involves performing volume reconstruction\nfollowed by material decomposition, or vice versa. However, these methods\ninherently suffer from the ill-posedness of the joint reconstruction problem.\nTo resolve this issue, we propose `A Dictionary-based Joint reconstruction and\nUnmixing method for Spectral Tomography' (ADJUST). Our formulation relies on\nforming a dictionary of spectral signatures of materials common in CT and prior\nknowledge of the number of materials present in an object. In particular, we\ndecompose the spectral volume linearly in terms of spatial material maps, a\nspectral dictionary, and the indicator of materials for the dictionary\nelements. We propose a memory-efficient accelerated alternating proximal\ngradient method to find an approximate solution to the resulting bi-convex\nproblem. From numerical demonstrations on several synthetic phantoms, we\nobserve that ADJUST performs exceedingly well when compared to other\nstate-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we address the robustness of ADJUST\nagainst limited measurement patterns.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a high resolution, 3D-consistent image and shape generation\ntechnique which we call StyleSDF. Our method is trained on single-view RGB data\nonly, and stands on the shoulders of StyleGAN2 for image generation, while\nsolving two main challenges in 3D-aware GANs: 1) high-resolution,\nview-consistent generation of the RGB images, and 2) detailed 3D shape. We\nachieve this by merging a SDF-based 3D representation with a style-based 2D\ngenerator. Our 3D implicit network renders low-resolution feature maps, from\nwhich the style-based network generates view-consistent, 1024x1024 images.\nNotably, our SDF-based 3D modeling defines detailed 3D surfaces, leading to\nconsistent volume rendering. Our method shows higher quality results compared\nto state of the art in terms of visual and geometric quality.",

A prior comparison of urban land surface models (ULSMs) found\nthat no single model is 'best' at predicting all common surface fluxes. Here,\nwe develop an urban neural network (UNN) trained on the mean predicted fluxes\nfrom 22 ULSMs at one site. The UNN emulates the mean output of ULSMs\naccurately. When compared to a reference ULSM (Town Energy Balance; TEB), the\nUNN has greater accuracy relative to flux observations, less computational\ncost, and requires fewer input parameters. When coupled to the Weather Research\nForecasting (WRF) model using TensorFlow bindings, WRF-UNN is stable and more\naccurate than the reference WRF-TEB.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViT) serve as powerful vision models. Unlike\nconvolutional neural networks, which dominated vision research in previous\nyears, vision transformers enjoy the ability to capture long-range dependencies\nin the data. Nonetheless, an integral part of any transformer architecture, the\nself-attention mechanism, suffers from high latency and inefficient memory\nutilization, making it less suitable for high-resolution input images. To\nalleviate these shortcomings, hierarchical vision models locally employ\nself-attention on non-interleaving windows. This relaxation reduces the\ncomplexity to be linear in the input size; however, it limits the cross-window\ninteraction, hurting the model performance. In this paper, we propose a new\nshift-invariant local attention layer, called query and attend (QnA), that\naggregates the input locally in an overlapping manner, much like convolutions.\nThe key idea behind QnA is to introduce learned queries, which allow fast and\nefficient implementation. We verify the effectiveness of our layer by\nincorporating it into a hierarchical vision transformer model. We show\nimprovements in speed and memory complexity while achieving comparable accuracy\nwith state-of-the-art models. Finally, our layer scales especially well with\nwindow size, requiring up-to x10 less memory while being up-to x5 faster than\nexisting methods.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art language models (LMs) represented by long-short term memory\nrecurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNNs) and Transformers are becoming\nincreasingly complex and expensive for practical applications. Low-bit neural\nnetwork quantization provides a powerful solution to dramatically reduce their\nmodel size. Current quantization methods are based on uniform precision and\nfail to account for the varying performance sensitivity at different parts of\nLMs to quantization errors. To this end, novel mixed precision neural network\nLM quantization methods are proposed in this paper. The optimal local precision\nchoices for LSTM-RNN and Transformer based neural LMs are automatically learned\nusing three techniques. The first two approaches are based on quantization\nsensitivity metrics in the form of either the KL-divergence measured between\nfull precision and quantized LMs, or Hessian trace weighted quantization\nperturbation that can be approximated efficiently using matrix free techniques.\nThe third approach is based on mixed precision neural architecture search. In\norder to overcome the difficulty in using gradient descent methods to directly\nestimate discrete quantized weights, alternating direction methods of\nmultipliers (ADMM) are used to efficiently train quantized LMs. Experiments\nwere conducted on state-of-the-art LF-MMI CNN-TDNN systems featuring speed\nperturbation, i-Vector and learning hidden unit contribution (LHUC) based\nspeaker adaptation on two tasks: Switchboard telephone speech and AMI meeting\ntranscription.

Hands have been separately studied but the focus\nhas been on generating realistic static grasps of objects. To synthesize\nvirtual characters that interact with the world, we need to generate full-body\nmotions and realistic hand grasps simultaneously. Both sub-problems are\nchallenging on their own and, together, the state-space of poses is\nsignificantly larger, the scales of hand and body motions differ, and the\nwhole-body posture and the hand grasp must agree, satisfy physical constraints,\nand be plausible. Additionally, the head is involved because the avatar must\nlook at the object to interact with it. For the first time, we address the\nproblem of generating full-body, hand and head motions of an avatar grasping an\nunknown object. As input, our method, called GOAL, takes a 3D object, its\nposition, and a starting 3D body pose and shape. GOAL outputs a sequence of\nwhole-body poses using two novel networks. First, GNet generates a goal\nwhole-body grasp with a realistic body, head, arm, and hand pose, as well as\nhand-object contact. Second, MNet generates the motion between the starting and\ngoal pose. This is challenging, as it requires the avatar to walk towards the\nobject with foot-ground contact, orient the head towards it, reach out, and\ngrasp it with a realistic hand pose and hand-object contact. To achieve this\nthe networks exploit a representation that combines SMPL-X body parameters and\n3D vertex offsets. We train and evaluate GOAL, both qualitatively and\nquantitatively, on the GRAB dataset. Results show that GOAL generalizes well to\nunseen objects, outperforming baselines. GOAL takes a step towards synthesizing\nrealistic full-body object grasping.",

    "abstract": "Multiple medical institutions collaboratively training a model using\nfederated learning (FL) has become a promising solution for maximizing the\npotential of data-driven models, yet the non-independent and identically\ndistributed (non-iid) data in medical images is still an outstanding challenge\nin real-world practice. The feature heterogeneity caused by diverse scanners or\nprotocols introduces a drift in the learning process, in both local (client)\nand global (server) optimizations, which harms the convergence as well as model\nperformance. Many previous works have attempted to address the non-iid issue by\ntackling the drift locally or globally, but how to jointly solve the two\nessentially coupled drifts is still unclear. In this work, we concentrate on\nhandling both local and global drifts and introduce a new harmonizing framework\ncalled HarmoFL. First, we propose to mitigate the local update drift by\nnormalizing amplitudes of images transformed into the frequency domain to mimic\na unified imaging setting, in order to generate a harmonized feature space\nacross local clients. Second, based on harmonized features, we design a client\nweight perturbation guiding each local model to reach a flat optimum, where a\nneighborhood area of the local optimal solution has a uniformly low loss.\nWithout any extra communication cost, the perturbation assists the global model\nto optimize towards a converged optimal solution by aggregating several local\nflat optima. We have theoretically analyzed the proposed method and empirically\nconducted extensive experiments on three medical image classification and\nsegmentation tasks, showing that HarmoFL outperforms a set of recent\nstate-of-the-art methods with promising convergence behavior.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has recently emerged as a promising approach for studying\ncomplex phenomena characterized by rich datasets. In particular, data-centric\napproaches lend to the possibility of automatically discovering structures in\nexperimental datasets that manual inspection may miss. Here, we introduce an\ninterpretable unsupervised-supervised hybrid machine learning approach, the\nhybrid-correlation convolutional neural network (Hybrid-CCNN), and apply it to\nexperimental data generated using a programmable quantum simulator based on\nRydberg atom arrays. Specifically, we apply Hybrid-CCNN to analyze new quantum\nphases on square lattices with programmable interactions. The initial\nunsupervised dimensionality reduction and clustering stage first reveals five\ndistinct quantum phase regions. In a second supervised stage, we refine these\nphase boundaries and characterize each phase by training fully interpretable\nCCNNs and extracting the relevant correlations for each phase. The\ncharacteristic spatial weightings and snippets of correlations specifically\nrecognized in each phase capture quantum fluctuations in the striated phase and\nidentify two previously undetected phases, the rhombic and boundary-ordered\nphases. These observations demonstrate that a combination of programmable\nquantum simulators with machine learning can be used as a powerful tool for\ndetailed exploration of correlated quantum states of matter.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is the workhorse algorithm of deep learning\ntechnology. At each step of the training phase, a mini batch of samples is\ndrawn from the training dataset and the weights of the neural network are\nadjusted according to the performance on this specific subset of examples. The\nmini-batch sampling procedure introduces a stochastic dynamics to the gradient\ndescent, with a non-trivial state-dependent noise. We characterize the\nstochasticity of SGD and a recently-introduced variant, persistent SGD, in a\nprototypical neural network model. In the under-parametrized regime, where the\nfinal training error is positive, the SGD dynamics reaches a stationary state\nand we define an effective temperature from the fluctuation-dissipation\ntheorem, computed from dynamical mean-field theory. We use the effective\ntemperature to quantify the magnitude of the SGD noise as a function of the\nproblem parameters. In the over-parametrized regime, where the training error\nvanishes, we measure the noise magnitude of SGD by computing the average\ndistance between two replicas of the system with the same initialization and\ntwo different realizations of SGD noise. We find that the two noise measures\nbehave similarly as a function of the problem parameters. Moreover, we observe\nthat noisier algorithms lead to wider decision boundaries of the corresponding\nconstraint satisfaction problem.",

    "abstract": "Shallow water equations are the foundation of most models for flooding and\nriver hydraulics analysis. These physics-based models are usually expensive and\nslow to run, thus not suitable for real-time prediction or parameter inversion.\nAn attractive alternative is surrogate model. This work introduces an\nefficient, accurate, and flexible surrogate model, NN-p2p, based on deep\nlearning and it can make point-to-point predictions on unstructured or\nirregular meshes. The new method was evaluated and compared against existing\nmethods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can only make\nimage-to-image predictions on structured or regular meshes. In NN-p2p, the\ninput includes both spatial coordinates and boundary features that can describe\nthe geometry of hydraulic structures, such as bridge piers. All surrogate\nmodels perform well in predicting flow around different types of piers in the\ntraining domain. However, only NN-p2p works well when spatial extrapolation is\nperformed. The limitations of CNN-based methods are rooted in their\nraster-image nature which cannot capture boundary geometry and flow features\nexactly, which are of paramount importance to fluid dynamics. NN-p2p also has\ngood performance in predicting flow around piers unseen by the neural network.\nThe NN-p2p model also respects conservation laws more strictly. The application\nof the proposed surrogate model was demonstrated by calculating the drag\ncoefficient $C_D$ for piers and a new linear relationship between $C_D$ and the\nlogarithmic transformation of pier's length/width ratio was discovered.",

Computing the probability distribution\nover states at time $t$ requires the matrix exponential $\\exp(tQ)$, and\ninferring $\\theta$ from data requires its derivative\n$\\partial\\exp\\!(tQ)/\\partial\\theta$. Both are challenging to compute when the\nstate space and hence the size of $Q$ is huge. This can happen when the state\nspace consists of all combinations of the values of several interacting\ndiscrete variables. Often it is even impossible to store $Q$.

The ballooning of spiders is hypothesised to be caused by the\npresence of the negative electric charge of the spider silk threads and the\npositive electric potential field in the earth's atmosphere. The numerical\nmodel presented here is first validated against experimental data from the open\nliterature. After which, two cases are examined, in the first it is assumed\nthat the electric charge is uniformly distributed along the threads while in\nthe second, the electric charge is located at the thread tip. It is shown that\nthe normalized terminal ballooning velocity, i.e. the velocity at which the\nspiders balloon after they reach steady-state, decrease linearly with the\nnormalized lift force, especially for the tip located charge case. For the\nuniform electric charge case, this velocity shows a slightly weaker dependence\non the normalized lift force. Moreover, it is shown in both cases that the\nnormalized terminal ballooning velocity has no dependence on the normalized\nelastic bending stiffness of the threads and on the normalized viscous forces.\nFinally, the multi-thread bending process shows a three-dimensional conical\nsheet. Here we show that this behavior is caused by the Coulomb repelling\nforces owing to the threads electric charge which leads to dispersing the\nthreads apart and thus avoid entanglement.",

Quite surprisingly training\nthe neural network via (stochastic) gradient descent leads to models that\ngeneralize very well, while classical statistics would suggest overfitting. In\norder to gain understanding of this implicit bias phenomenon we study the\nspecial case of sparse recovery (compressive sensing) which is of interest on\nits own. More precisely, in order to reconstruct a vector from underdetermined\nlinear measurements, we introduce a corresponding overparameterized square loss\nfunctional, where the vector to be reconstructed is deeply factorized into\nseveral vectors. We show that, under a very mild assumption on the measurement\nmatrix, vanilla gradient flow for the overparameterized loss functional\nconverges to a solution of minimal $\\ell_1$-norm. The latter is well-known to\npromote sparse solutions. As a by-product, our results significantly improve\nthe sample complexity for compressive sensing in previous works.

Our results suggest that median\nfrequency is the best complexity measure in deciding about an acceptable input\ndownsampling factor and network depth.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a multi-bit reconfigurable intelligent surface with\nhigh-resolution beam steering capability in the azimuthal plane for deployment\nat sub-6 Gigahertz (GHz) band. Field trials in realistic indoor deployments\nhave been carried out, with coverage enhancement performance ascertained for\nthree common wireless communication scenarios. Namely, serving users in an open\nlobby with mixed line of sight and non-line of sight conditions, communication\nvia a junction between long corridors, and a multi-floor scenario with\npropagation via windows. This work explores the potential for reconfigurable\nintelligent surface (RIS) deployment to mitigate non-line of sight effects in\nan indoor wireless communications. In a single transmitter, single receiver\nnon-line of sight link, received power improvement of as much as 40 dB is shown\nto be achievable by suitable placement of an RIS, with an instantaneous\nbandwidth of at least 100 MHz possible over a 3 to 4.5 GHz range. In addition,\nthe effects of phase resolution on the optimal power reception for the\nmulti-bit RIS have been experimentally verified, with a 2.65 dB improvement\ncompared to a 1-bit case.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical decision making involves multiple signal processing, either from\ndifferent sensors or from different channels.

A deep learning based electroencephalogram channels'\nfeature level fusion is carried out in this work for the electroencephalogram\ncyclic alternating pattern A phase classification. Channel selection, fusion,\nand classification procedures were optimized by two optimization algorithms,\nnamely, Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization. The developed\nmethodologies were evaluated by fusing the information from multiple\nelectroencephalogram channels for patients with nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy\nand patients without any neurological disorder, which was significantly more\nchallenging when compared to other state of the art works. Results showed that\nboth optimization algorithms selected a comparable structure with similar\nfeature level fusion, consisting of three electroencephalogram channels, which\nis in line with the CAP protocol to ensure multiple channels' arousals for CAP\ndetection. Moreover, the two optimized models reached an area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82, with average accuracy ranging\nfrom 77% to 79%, a result which is in the upper range of the specialist\nagreement.

    "abstract": "A promising approach to improve cloud parameterizations within climate models\nand thus climate projections is to use deep learning in combination with\ntraining data from storm-resolving model (SRM) simulations. The Icosahedral\nNon-Hydrostatic (ICON) modeling framework permits simulations ranging from\nnumerical weather prediction to climate projections, making it an ideal target\nto develop neural network (NN) based parameterizations for sub-grid scale\nprocesses. Within the ICON framework, we train NN based cloud cover\nparameterizations with coarse-grained data based on realistic regional and\nglobal ICON SRM simulations. We set up three different types of NNs that differ\nin the degree of vertical locality they assume for diagnosing cloud cover from\ncoarse-grained atmospheric state variables. The NNs accurately estimate\nsub-grid scale cloud cover from coarse-grained data that has similar\ngeographical characteristics as their training data. Additionally, globally\ntrained NNs can reproduce sub-grid scale cloud cover of the regional SRM\nsimulation. Using the game-theory based interpretability library SHapley\nAdditive exPlanations, we identify an overemphasis on specific humidity and\ncloud ice as the reason why our column-based NN cannot perfectly generalize\nfrom the global to the regional coarse-grained SRM data. The interpretability\ntool also helps visualize similarities and differences in feature importance\nbetween regionally and globally trained column-based NNs, and reveals a local\nrelationship between their cloud cover predictions and the thermodynamic\nenvironment. Our results show the potential of deep learning to derive accurate\nyet interpretable cloud cover parameterizations from global SRMs, and suggest\nthat neighborhood-based models may be a good compromise between accuracy and\ngeneralizability.",

    "abstract": "Communication security could be enhanced at physical layer but at the cost of\ncomplex algorithms and redundant hardware, which would render traditional\nphysical layer security (PLS) techniques unsuitable for use with\nresource-constrained communication systems. This work investigates a\nwaveform-defined security (WDS) framework, which differs fundamentally from\ntraditional PLS techniques used in today's systems. The framework is not\ndependent on channel conditions such as signal power advantage and channel\nstate information (CSI). Therefore, the framework is more reliable than channel\ndependent beamforming and artificial noise (AN) techniques. In addition, the\nframework is more than just increasing the cost of eavesdropping. By\nintentionally tuning waveform patterns to weaken signal feature diversity and\nenhance feature similarity, eavesdroppers will not be able to identify\ncorrectly signal formats. The wrong classification of signal formats would\nresult in subsequent detection errors even when an eavesdropper uses\nbrute-force detection techniques. To get a robust WDS framework, three impact\nfactors, namely training data feature, oversampling factor and bandwidth\ncompression factor (BCF) offset, are investigated. An optimal WDS waveform\npattern is obtained at the end after a joint study of the three factors. To\nensure a valid eavesdropping model, artificial intelligence (AI) dependent\nsignal classifiers are designed followed by optimal performance achievable\nsignal detectors. To show the compatibility in available communication systems,\nthe WDS framework is successfully integrated in IEEE 802.11a with nearly no\nadding computational complexity. Finally, a low-cost software-defined radio\n(SDR) experiment is designed to verify the feasibility of the WDS framework in\nresource-constrained communications.",

In this paper, covert\ncommunication is considered in the presence of the RIS. While there is an\nongoing transmission boosted by the RIS, both the intended receiver and an\neavesdropper individually try to detect this transmission using their own deep\nneural network (DNN) classifiers. The RIS interaction vector is designed by\nbalancing two (potentially conflicting) objectives of focusing the transmitted\nsignal to the receiver and keeping the transmitted signal away from the\neavesdropper. To boost covert communications, adversarial perturbations are\nadded to signals at the transmitter to fool the eavesdropper's classifier while\nkeeping the effect on the receiver low. Results from different network\ntopologies show that adversarial perturbation and RIS interaction vector can be\njointly designed to effectively increase the signal detection accuracy at the\nreceiver while reducing the detection accuracy at the eavesdropper to enable\ncovert communications.",

Double validity is an entirely\nnew property for partial identification: DVDS estimators still provide valid,\nthough not sharp, bounds even when most nuisance parameters are misspecified.\nIn fact, even in cases when DVDS point estimates fail to be asymptotically\nnormal, standard Wald confidence intervals may remain valid.
