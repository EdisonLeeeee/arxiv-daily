    "abstract": "In self-supervised learning, it is challenging to reduce the gap between the\nenhancement performance on the estimated and target speech signals with existed\npre-tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-task pre-training method to\nimprove the speech enhancement performance with self-supervised learning.\nWithin the pre-training autoencoder (PAE), only a limited set of clean speech\nsignals are required to learn their latent representations. Meanwhile, to solve\nthe limitation of single pre-task, the proposed masking module exploits the\ndereverberated mask and estimated ratio mask to denoise the mixture as the\nsecond pre-task. Different from the PAE, where the target speech signals are\nestimated, the downstream task autoencoder (DAE) utilizes a large number of\nunlabeled and unseen reverberant mixtures to generate the estimated mixtures.\nThe trained DAE is shared by the learned representations and masks.\nExperimental results on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.",

We then argue that,\ncompared to the number of articles discussing the quality of citizen-generated\ndata, little attention has been dedicated to discussing the social and\npolitical implications of this kind of practice. While this article does not\nintend to present definitive answers, it outlines inevitable challenges and\nindicates potential directions for future studies on the techno-politics of\ndisaster data collection. Within a techno-politics approach, we argue for a\nmodel of political participation that recognizes citizens providing data to\nshape cities as equal experts in the production of knowledge and\ndecision-making, rather than external contributors collecting data for formal\nauthorities. This political participation approach, we believe, would increase\nthe dependence of formal scientific knowledge on citizens' daily-lived\nexperiences, create horizontal collaborations among diverse stakeholders, in\nterms of respect and recognition, and increase the humanization of marginalized\ncommunities, particularly from the Global South.",

    "abstract": "Renewable energy resources (RERs) have been increasingly integrated into\nmodern power systems, especially in large-scale distribution networks (DNs). In\nthis paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach to\ndynamically search for the optimal operation point, i.e., optimal power flow\n(OPF), in DNs with a high uptake of RERs. Considering uncertainties and voltage\nfluctuation issues caused by RERs, we formulate OPF into a multi-objective\noptimization (MOO) problem. To solve the MOO problem, we develop a novel DRL\nalgorithm leveraging the graphical information of the distribution network.\nSpecifically, we employ the state-of-the-art DRL algorithm, i.e., deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (DDPG), to learn an optimal strategy for OPF.\nSince power flow reallocation in the DN is a consecutive process, where nodes\nare self-correlated and interrelated in temporal and spatial views, to make\nfull use of DNs' graphical information, we develop a multi-grained\nattention-based spatial-temporal graph convolution network (MG-ASTGCN) for\nspatial-temporal graph information extraction, preparing for its sequential\nDDPG. We validate our proposed DRL-based approach in modified IEEE 33, 69, and\n118-bus radial distribution systems (RDSs) and show that our DRL-based approach\noutperforms other benchmark algorithms. Our experimental results also reveal\nthat MG-ASTGCN can significantly accelerate the DDPG training process and\nimprove DDPG's capability in reallocating power flow for OPF. The proposed\nDRL-based approach also promotes DNs' stability in the presence of node faults,\nespecially for large-scale DNs.",

However, in high-stakes domains such as\ncriminal justice and healthcare, full automation is often not desirable due to\nsafety, ethical, and legal concerns, yet fully manual approaches can be\ninaccurate and time consuming. As a result, there is growing interest in the\nresearch community to augment human decision making with AI assistance. Besides\ndeveloping AI technologies for this purpose, the emerging field of human-AI\ndecision making must embrace empirical approaches to form a foundational\nunderstanding of how humans interact and work with AI to make decisions. To\ninvite and help structure research efforts towards a science of understanding\nand improving human-AI decision making, we survey recent literature of\nempirical human-subject studies on this topic. We summarize the study design\nchoices made in over 100 papers in three important aspects: (1) decision tasks,\n(2) AI models and AI assistance elements, and (3) evaluation metrics. For each\naspect, we summarize current trends, discuss gaps in current practices of the\nfield, and make a list of recommendations for future research. Our survey\nhighlights the need to develop common frameworks to account for the design and\nresearch spaces of human-AI decision making, so that researchers can make\nrigorous choices in study design, and the research community can build on each\nother's work and produce generalizable scientific knowledge. We also hope this\nsurvey will serve as a bridge for HCI and AI communities to work together to\nmutually shape the empirical science and computational technologies for\nhuman-AI decision making.",

The language used in social media is\noften a combination of English and the native language in the region.

    "abstract": "Existing human mobility forecasting models follow the standard design of the\ntime-series prediction model which takes a series of numerical values as input\nto generate a numerical value as a prediction. Although treating this as a\nregression problem seems straightforward, incorporating various contextual\ninformation such as the semantic category information of each Place-of-Interest\n(POI) is a necessary step, and often the bottleneck, in designing an effective\nmobility prediction model. As opposed to the typical approach, we treat\nforecasting as a translation problem and propose a novel forecasting through a\nlanguage generation pipeline. The paper aims to address the human mobility\nforecasting problem as a language translation task in a sequence-to-sequence\nmanner. A mobility-to-language template is first introduced to describe the\nnumerical mobility data as natural language sentences. The core intuition of\nthe human mobility forecasting translation task is to convert the input\nmobility description sentences into a future mobility description from which\nthe prediction target can be obtained. Under this pipeline, a two-branch\nnetwork, SHIFT (Translating Human Mobility Forecasting), is designed.\nSpecifically, it consists of one main branch for language generation and one\nauxiliary branch to directly learn mobility patterns. During the training, we\ndevelop a momentum mode for better connecting and training the two branches.\nExtensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed SHIFT is effective and presents a new revolutionary approach to\nforecasting human mobility.",

The community has recently\nused machine translation to revive and strengthen several African languages.\nHowever, the trained models are often bilingual, resulting in a potentially\nexponential number of models to train and maintain to cover all possible\ntranslation directions. Additionally, bilingual models do not leverage the\nsimilarity between some of the languages.

Using the BLEU, CHRF, and TER scores\ncomputed with the Sacrebleu (Post, 2018) package for reproducibility, we show\nthat English2Gbe outperforms bilingual models (English to Ewe and English to\nFon) and gives state-of-the-art results on the JW300 benchmark for Fon\nestablished by Nekoto et al.

This includes coprime extensions where\nthe normal Hall subgroup is Abelian and the complement is $O(1)$-generated\n(Qiao, Sarma, & Tang, STACS 2011), and groups with no Abelian normal subgroups\n(Babai, Codenotti, & Qiao, ICALP 2012). In both of these cases, the previous\nstrategy involved identifying key group-theoretic structure that could then be\nleveraged algorithmically, resulting in different algorithms for each family. A\ncommon theme among these is that the group-theoretic structure is mostly about\nthe action of one group on another. Our main contribution is to show that a\nsingle, combinatorial algorithm (Weisfeiler-Leman) can identify those same\ngroup-theoretic structures in polynomial time.\nWe also derive consequences for the parallel complexity of testing\nisomorphism in these families. In particular, we show that constant-dimensional\nWeisfeiler-Leman only requires a constant number of rounds to identify groups\nin the above classes. Combining this result with the parallel Weisfeiler-Leman\nimplementation of Grohe & Verbitsky for graphs (ICALP 2006), this puts\nisomorphism testing for each of these families of groups into\n$\\mathsf{TC}^{0}$.

Recent approaches using machine learning (ML) models as the\ndecoders offer both improved performance and great adaptability to unknown\nenvironments, where traditional decoders struggle. We introduce a general\nframework to further boost the performance and applicability of ML models. We\npropose to combine ML decoders with a competing discriminator network that\ntries to distinguish between codewords and noisy words, and, hence, guides the\ndecoding models to recover transmitted codewords. Our framework is\ngame-theoretic, motivated by generative adversarial networks (GANs), with the\ndecoder and discriminator competing in a zero-sum game. The decoder learns to\nsimultaneously decode and generate codewords while the discriminator learns to\ntell the differences between decoded outputs and codewords. Thus, the decoder\nis able to decode noisy received signals into codewords, increasing the\nprobability of successful decoding. We show a strong connection of our\nframework with the optimal maximum likelihood decoder by proving that this\ndecoder defines a Nash equilibrium point of our game. Hence, training to\nequilibrium has a good possibility of achieving the optimal maximum likelihood\nperformance. Moreover, our framework does not require training labels, which\nare typically unavailable during communications, and, thus, seemingly can be\ntrained online and adapt to channel dynamics.

In parallel, different images are of\nvaried complexity and their different regions can contain various levels of\nvisual information, indicating that treating all regions/tokens equally in\nterms of model complexity is unnecessary while such opportunities for trimming\ndown ViTs' complexity have not been fully explored. To this end, we propose a\nMulti-grained Input-adaptive Vision Transformer framework dubbed MIA-Former\nthat can input-adaptively adjust the structure of ViTs at three\ncoarse-to-fine-grained granularities (i.e., model depth and the number of model\nheads/tokens). In particular, our MIA-Former adopts a low-cost network trained\nwith a hybrid supervised and reinforcement training method to skip unnecessary\nlayers, heads, and tokens in an input adaptive manner, reducing the overall\ncomputational cost. Furthermore, an interesting side effect of our MIA-Former\nis that its resulting ViTs are naturally equipped with improved robustness\nagainst adversarial attacks over their static counterparts, because\nMIA-Former's multi-grained dynamic control improves the model diversity similar\nto the effect of ensemble and thus increases the difficulty of adversarial\nattacks against all its sub-models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies\nvalidate that the proposed MIA-Former framework can effectively allocate\ncomputation budgets adaptive to the difficulty of input images meanwhile\nincrease robustness, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy-efficiency\ntrade-offs, e.g., 20% computation savings with the same or even a higher\naccuracy compared with SOTA dynamic transformer models.",

Unfortunately, power-gates increase the\nsystem's power-delivery impedance and voltage guardband, limiting the system's\nmaximum attainable voltage (i.e., Vmax) and, thus, the CPU core's maximum\nattainable frequency (i.e., Fmax). As a result, systems that are performance\nconstrained by the CPU frequency (i.e., Fmax-constrained), such as high-end\ndesktops, suffer significant performance loss due to power-gates.\nTo mitigate this performance loss, we propose DarkGates, a hybrid system\narchitecture that increases the performance of Fmax-constrained systems while\nfulfilling their power efficiency requirements. DarkGates is based on three key\ntechniques: i) bypassing on-chip power-gates using package-level resources\n(called bypass mode), ii) extending power management firmware to support\noperation either in bypass mode or normal mode, and iii) introducing deeper\nidle power states.\nWe implement DarkGates on an Intel Skylake microprocessor for client devices\nand evaluate it using a wide variety of workloads.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of cross-dataset generalization of 3D human\npose estimation models. Testing a pre-trained 3D pose estimator on a new\ndataset results in a major performance drop. Previous methods have mainly\naddressed this problem by improving the diversity of the training data. We\nargue that diversity alone is not sufficient and that the characteristics of\nthe training data need to be adapted to those of the new dataset such as camera\nviewpoint, position, human actions, and body size. To this end, we propose\nAdaptPose, an end-to-end framework that generates synthetic 3D human motions\nfrom a source dataset and uses them to fine-tune a 3D pose estimator. AdaptPose\nfollows an adversarial training scheme. From a source 3D pose the generator\ngenerates a sequence of 3D poses and a camera orientation that is used to\nproject the generated poses to a novel view. Without any 3D labels or camera\ninformation AdaptPose successfully learns to create synthetic 3D poses from the\ntarget dataset while only being trained on 2D poses. In experiments on the\nHuman3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, 3DPW, and Ski-Pose datasets our method outperforms\nprevious work in cross-dataset evaluations by 14% and previous semi-supervised\nlearning methods that use partial 3D annotations by 16%.",

    "title": "GCoD: Graph Convolutional Network Acceleration via Dedicated Algorithm  and Accelerator Co-Design",
    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art\ngraph learning model. However, it can be notoriously challenging to inference\nGCNs over large graph datasets, limiting their application to large real-world\ngraphs and hindering the exploration of deeper and more sophisticated GCN\ngraphs. This is because real-world graphs can be extremely large and sparse.\nFurthermore, the node degree of GCNs tends to follow the power-law distribution\nand therefore have highly irregular adjacency matrices, resulting in\nprohibitive inefficiencies in both data processing and movement and thus\nsubstantially limiting the achievable GCN acceleration efficiency. To this end,\nthis paper proposes a GCN algorithm and accelerator Co-Design framework dubbed\nGCoD which can largely alleviate the aforementioned GCN irregularity and boost\nGCNs' inference efficiency. Specifically, on the algorithm level, GCoD\nintegrates a split and conquer GCN training strategy that polarizes the graphs\nto be either denser or sparser in local neighborhoods without compromising the\nmodel accuracy, resulting in graph adjacency matrices that (mostly) have merely\ntwo levels of workload and enjoys largely enhanced regularity and thus ease of\nacceleration. On the hardware level, we further develop a dedicated two-pronged\naccelerator with a separated engine to process each of the aforementioned\ndenser and sparser workloads, further boosting the overall utilization and\nacceleration efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate\nthat our GCoD consistently reduces the number of off-chip accesses, leading to\nspeedups of 15286x, 294x, 7.8x, and 2.5x as compared to CPUs, GPUs, and\nprior-art GCN accelerators including HyGCN and AWB-GCN, respectively, while\nmaintaining or even improving the task accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Context: Logs are often the primary source of information for system\ndevelopers and operations engineers to understand and diagnose the behavior of\na software system in production. In many cases, logs are the only evidence\navailable for fault investigation. Problem: However, the inappropriate choice\nof log severity level can impact the amount of log data generated and,\nconsequently, quality. This storage overhead can impact the performance of\nlog-based monitoring systems, as excess log data comes with increased aggregate\nnoise, making it challenging to utilize what is actually important when trying\nto do diagnostics. Goal: This research aims to decrease the overheads of\nmonitoring systems by processing the severity level of log data from systems in\nproduction. Approach: To achieve this goal, we intend to deepen the knowledge\nabout the log severity levels and develop an automated approach to log severity\nlevel classification, demonstrating that reducing log severity level \"noise\"\nimproves the monitoring of systems in production. Conclusion: We hope that the\nset of contributions from this work can improve the monitoring activities of\nsoftware systems and contribute to the creation of knowledge that improves\nlogging practices",

    "title": "Rightsizing Clusters for Time-Limited Tasks",
    "abstract": "In conventional public clouds, designing a suitable initial cluster for a\ngiven application workload is important in reducing the computational\nfoot-print during run-time. In edge or on-premise clouds, cold-start\nrightsizing the cluster at the time of installation is crucial in avoiding the\nrecurrent capital expenditure. In both these cases, rightsizing has to balance\ncost-performance trade-off for a given application with multiple tasks, where\neach task can demand multiple resources, and the cloud offers nodes with\ndifferent capacity and cost. Multidimensional bin-packing can address this\ncold-start rightsizing problem, but assumes that every task is always active.\nIn contrast, real-world tasks (e.g. load bursts, batch and dead-lined tasks\nwith time-limits) may be active only during specific time-periods or may have\ndynamic load profiles. The cluster cost can be reduced by reusing resources via\ntime sharing and optimal packing. This motivates our generalized problem of\ncold-start rightsizing for time-limited tasks: given a timeline, time-periods\nand resource demands for tasks, the objective is to place the tasks on a\nminimum cost cluster of nodes without violating node capacities at any time\ninstance. We design a baseline two-phase algorithm that performs penalty-based\nmapping of task to node-type and then, solves each node-type independently. We\nprove that the algorithm has an approximation ratio of O(D min(m, T)), where D,\nm and T are the number of resources, node-types and timeslots, respectively. We\nthen present an improved linear programming based mapping strategy, enhanced\nfurther with a cross-node-type filling mechanism. Our experiments on synthetic\nand real-world cluster traces show significant cost reduction by LP-based\nmapping compared to the baseline, and the filling mechanism improves further to\nproduce solutions within 20% of (a lower-bound to) the optimal solution.",

However, existing eye-based frameworks\na) perform authentication and Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) independently\nand b) involve significant pre-processing steps to extract the iris region.\nHere, we introduce a joint framework for EA and PAD using periocular images.\nWhile a deep Multitask Learning (MTL) network can perform both the tasks, MTL\nsuffers from the forgetting effect since the training datasets for EA and PAD\nare disjoint. To overcome this, we propose Eye Authentication with PAD\n(EyePAD), a distillation-based method that trains a single network for EA and\nPAD while reducing the effect of forgetting. To further improve the EA\nperformance, we introduce a novel approach called EyePAD++ that includes\ntraining an MTL network on both EA and PAD data, while distilling the\n`versatility' of the EyePAD network through an additional distillation step.\nOur proposed methods outperform the SOTA in PAD and obtain near-SOTA\nperformance in eye-to-eye verification, without any pre-processing.

    "abstract": "As a well-known optimization framework, the Alternating Direction Method of\nMultipliers (ADMM) has achieved tremendous success in many classification and\nregression applications. Recently, it has attracted the attention of deep\nlearning researchers and is considered to be a potential substitute to Gradient\nDescent (GD). However, as an emerging domain, several challenges remain\nunsolved, including 1) The lack of global convergence guarantees, 2) Slow\nconvergence towards solutions, and 3) Cubic time complexity with regard to\nfeature dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization framework to\nsolve a general neural network training problem via ADMM (dlADMM) to address\nthese challenges simultaneously. Specifically, the parameters in each layer are\nupdated backward and then forward so that parameter information in each layer\nis exchanged efficiently. When the dlADMM is applied to specific architectures,\nthe time complexity of subproblems is reduced from cubic to quadratic via a\ndedicated algorithm design utilizing quadratic approximations and backtracking\ntechniques. Last but not least, we provide the first proof of convergence to a\ncritical point sublinearly for an ADMM-type method (dlADMM) under mild\nconditions. Experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nconvergence, efficiency, and effectiveness of our proposed dlADMM algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Preintegration is a technique for high-dimensional integration over\n$d$-dimensional Euclidean space, which is designed to reduce an integral whose\nintegrand contains kinks or jumps to a $(d-1)$-dimensional integral of a smooth\nfunction. The resulting smoothness allows efficient evaluation of the\n$(d-1)$-dimensional integral by a Quasi-Monte Carlo or Sparse Grid method. The\ntechnique is similar to conditional sampling in statistical contexts, but the\nintention is different: in conditional sampling the aim is to reduce the\nvariance, rather than to achieve smoothness. Preintegration involves an initial\nintegration with respect to one well chosen real-valued variable. Griebel, Kuo,\nSloan [Math. Comp. 82 (2013), 383--400] and Griewank, Kuo, Le\\\"ovey, Sloan [J.\nComput. Appl.

The question addressed in\nthis paper is whether this monotonicity property with respect to one well\nchosen variable is necessary. We show here that the answer is essentially yes,\nin the sense that without this property the resulting $(d-1)$-dimensional\nintegrand is generally not smooth, having square-root or other singularities.",

    "abstract": "Over-smoothing is a challenging problem, which degrades the performance of\ndeep graph convolutional networks (GCNs). However, existing studies for\nalleviating the over-smoothing problem lack either generality or effectiveness.\nIn this paper, we analyze the underlying issues behind the over-smoothing\nproblem, i.e., feature-diversity degeneration, gradient vanishing, and model\nweights over-decaying. Inspired by this, we propose a simple yet effective\nplug-and-play module, SkipNode, to alleviate over-smoothing. Specifically, for\neach middle layer of a GCN model, SkipNode randomly (or based on node degree)\nselects nodes to skip the convolutional operation by directly feeding their\ninput features to the nonlinear function. Analytically, 1) skipping the\nconvolutional operation prevents the features from losing diversity; and 2) the\n\"skipped\" nodes enable gradients to be directly passed back, thus mitigating\nthe gradient vanishing and model weights over-decaying issues. To demonstrate\nthe superiority of SkipNode, we conduct extensive experiments on nine popular\ndatasets, including both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, with different\ngraph sizes on two typical tasks: node classification and link prediction.\nSpecifically, 1) SkipNode has strong generalizability of being applied to\nvarious GCN-based models on different datasets and tasks; and 2) SkipNode\noutperforms recent state-of-the-art anti-over-smoothing plug-and-play modules,\ni.e., DropEdge and DropNode, in different settings.

Based on these\nfindings, we propose an enhanced strategy named SDMRT by adding two stages to\nclassic SDM: one is Pre-Rerank on self-distilled data, the other is Fine-Tune\non Filtered teacher-distilled data. Our results outperform baselines by 0.6 to\n1.2 BLEU on multiple NAT models. As another bonus, for Iterative Refinement NAT\nmodels, our methods can outperform baselines within half iteration number,\nwhich means 2X acceleration.",

While there has been substantial work in the robustness of object\ndetection algorithms and online metric learning, there is little research on\nbenchmarking scoring metrics to determine any possible indicators of potential\nmisclassification. An emphasis is put on exploring the potential of taking\nthese scoring metrics online in order to allow the AV to make perception-based\ndecisions given real-time constraints.

In image recognition tasks, the trained classifier\noften gives high confidence score for input images which are remote from the\nin-distribution (id) data, and this has greatly limited its application in real\nworld. For alleviating this problem, we propose a GAN based boundary aware\nclassifier (GBAC) for generating a closed hyperspace which only contains most\nid data. Our method is based on the fact that the traditional neural net\nseperates the feature space as several unclosed regions which are not suitable\nfor ood detection.

While the IA\nassociated with a particular CCS design can be estimated via a computational\nfluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, using CFD to derive the IAs associated with\nnumerous CCS designs is prohibitively costly. Fortunately, previous works such\nas Deep Fluids (DF) (Kim et al., 2019) show that large simulation speedups are\nachievable by replacing CFD simulators with neural network (NN) surrogates that\nfaithfully mimic the CFD simulation process. This raises the possibility of a\nfast, accurate replacement for a CFD simulator and therefore efficient\napproximation of the IAs required by CCS design optimization. Thus, here, we\nbuild on the DF approach to develop surrogates that can successfully be applied\nto our complex carbon-capture CFD simulations. Our optimized DF-style\nsurrogates produce large speedups (4000x) while obtaining IA relative errors as\nlow as 4% on unseen CCS configurations that lie within the range of training\nconfigurations.

However, this patterning is currently expensive and requires\ncomplex processes with long manufacturing lead time. The present work\ndemonstrates a process for the fabrication of micro-nano 3D metal-plastic\ncomposite structures with arbitrarily complex shapes. In this approach, a\nlight-cured resin is modified to prepare an active precursor capable of\nallowing subsequent electroless plating (ELP). A multi-material digital light\nprocessing 3D printer was newly developed to enable the fabrication of parts\ncontaining regions made of either standard resin or active precursor resin\nnested within each other.

The\nproposed method can also generate metal coatings exhibiting improved adhesion\nof metal to plastic substrate.

    "abstract": "Recently, many approaches tackle the Unsupervised Domain Adaptive person\nre-identification (UDA re-ID) problem through pseudo-label-based contrastive\nlearning. During training, a uni-centroid representation is obtained by simply\naveraging all the instance features from a cluster with the same pseudo label.\nHowever, a cluster may contain images with different identities (label noises)\ndue to the imperfect clustering results, which makes the uni-centroid\nrepresentation inappropriate. In this paper, we present a novel Multi-Centroid\nMemory (MCM) to adaptively capture different identity information within the\ncluster. MCM can effectively alleviate the issue of label noises by selecting\nproper positive/negative centroids for the query image. Moreover, we further\npropose two strategies to improve the contrastive learning process. First, we\npresent a Domain-Specific Contrastive Learning (DSCL) mechanism to fully\nexplore intradomain information by comparing samples only from the same domain.\nSecond, we propose Second-Order Nearest Interpolation (SONI) to obtain abundant\nand informative negative samples. We integrate MCM, DSCL, and SONI into a\nunified framework named Multi-Centroid Representation Network (MCRN). Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the superiority of MCRN over state-of-the-art\napproaches on multiple UDA re-ID tasks and fully unsupervised re-ID tasks.",

In this\npaper, we introduce the Visual Question Answering task in 3D real-world scenes\n(VQA-3D), which aims to answer all possible questions given a 3D scene. To\ntackle this problem, the first VQA-3D dataset, namely CLEVR3D, is proposed,\nwhich contains 60K questions in 1,129 real-world scenes. Specifically, we\ndevelop a question engine leveraging 3D scene graph structures to generate\ndiverse reasoning questions, covering the questions of objects' attributes\n(i.e., size, color, and material) and their spatial relationships. Built upon\nthis dataset, we further design the first VQA-3D baseline model, TransVQA3D.\nThe TransVQA3D model adopts well-designed Transformer architectures to achieve\nsuperior VQA-3D performance, compared with the pure language baseline and\nprevious 3D reasoning methods directly applied to 3D scenarios.

    "abstract": "Deep learning approaches have achieved highly accurate face recognition by\ntraining the models with very large face image datasets. Unlike the\navailability of large 2D face image datasets, there is a lack of large 3D face\ndatasets available to the public. Existing public 3D face datasets were usually\ncollected with few subjects, leading to the over-fitting problem. This paper\nproposes two CNN models to improve the RGB-D face recognition task. The first\nis a segmentation-aware depth estimation network, called DepthNet, which\nestimates depth maps from RGB face images by including semantic segmentation\ninformation for more accurate face region localization. The other is a novel\nmask-guided RGB-D face recognition model that contains an RGB recognition\nbranch, a depth map recognition branch, and an auxiliary segmentation mask\nbranch with a spatial attention module. Our DepthNet is used to augment a large\n2D face image dataset to a large RGB-D face dataset, which is used for training\nan accurate RGB-D face recognition model. Furthermore, the proposed mask-guided\nRGB-D face recognition model can fully exploit the depth map and segmentation\nmask information and is more robust against pose variation than previous\nmethods. Our experimental results show that DepthNet can produce more reliable\ndepth maps from face images with the segmentation mask.

Finding\nenergy-efficient designs for federated learning (FL)-enabled wireless networks\nis of great interest. This work first proposes novel synchronous, asynchronous,\nand session-based designs for energy-efficient massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output networks to support FL. The synchronous design relies on strict\nsynchronization among users when executing each FL communication round, while\nthe asynchronous design allows more flexibility for users to save energy by\nusing lower computing frequencies. The session-based design splits the downlink\nand uplink phases in each FL communication round into separate sessions. In\nthis design, we assign users such that one of the participating users in each\nsession finishes its transmission and does not join the next session. As such,\nmore power and degrees of freedom will be allocated to unfinished users,\nleading to higher rates, lower transmission times, and hence, a higher energy\nefficiency. In all three designs, we use zero-forcing processing for both\nuplink and downlink, and develop algorithms that optimize user assignment, time\nallocation, power, and computing frequencies to minimize the energy consumption\nat the base station and users, while guaranteeing a predefined maximum\nexecution time of one FL communication round.",

    "abstract": "The local optimality of motion vectors (MVs) is an intrinsic property in\nvideo coding, and any modifications to the MVs will inevitably destroy this\noptimality, making it a sensitive indicator of steganography in the MV domain.\nThus the local optimality is commonly used to design steganalytic features, and\nthe estimation for local optimality has become a top priority in video\nsteganalysis. However, the local optimality in existing works is often\nestimated inaccurately or using an unreasonable assumption, limiting its\ncapability in steganalysis. In this paper, we propose to estimate the local\noptimality in a more reasonable and comprehensive fashion, and generalize the\nconcept of local optimality in two aspects. First, the local optimality\nmeasured in a rate-distortion sense is jointly determined by MV and predicted\nmotion vector (PMV), and the variability of PMV will affect the estimation for\nlocal optimality. Hence we generalize the local optimality from a static\nestimation to a dynamic one. Second, the PMV is a special case of MV, and can\nalso reflect the embedding traces in MVs. So we generalize the local optimality\nfrom the MV domain to the PMV domain. Based on the two generalizations of local\noptimality, we construct new types of steganalytic features and also propose\nfeature symmetrization rules to reduce feature dimension. Extensive experiments\nperformed on three databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nfeatures, which achieve state-of-the-art in both accuracy and robustness in\nvarious conditions, including cover source mismatch, video prediction methods,\nvideo codecs, and video resolutions.",

Most existing methods train multiple models to\npredict multi-level labels independently, while ignoring the dependence between\nhierarchically structured labels. In this paper, we consider multi-level IDRR\nas a conditional label sequence generation task and propose a Label\nDependence-aware Sequence Generation Model (LDSGM) for it. Specifically, we\nfirst design a label attentive encoder to learn the global representation of an\ninput instance and its level-specific contexts, where the label dependence is\nintegrated to obtain better label embeddings. Then, we employ a label sequence\ndecoder to output the predicted labels in a top-down manner, where the\npredicted higher-level labels are directly used to guide the label prediction\nat the current level. We further develop a mutual learning enhanced training\nmethod to exploit the label dependence in a bottomup direction, which is\ncaptured by an auxiliary decoder introduced during training. Experimental\nresults on the PDTB dataset show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance on multi-level IDRR. We will release our code at\nhttps://github.com/nlpersECJTU/LDSGM.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive losses have long been a key ingredient of deep metric learning\nand are now becoming more popular due to the success of self-supervised\nlearning. Recent research has shown the benefit of decomposing such losses into\ntwo sub-losses which act in a complementary way when learning the\nrepresentation network: a positive term and an entropy term. Although the\noverall loss is thus defined as a combination of two terms, the balance of\nthese two terms is often hidden behind implementation details and is largely\nignored and sub-optimal in practice. In this work, we approach the balance of\ncontrastive losses as a hyper-parameter optimization problem, and propose a\ncoordinate descent-based search method that efficiently find the\nhyper-parameters that optimize evaluation performance. In the process, we\nextend existing balance analyses to the contrastive margin loss, include batch\nsize in the balance, and explain how to aggregate loss elements from the batch\nto maintain near-optimal performance over a larger range of batch sizes.\nExtensive experiments with benchmarks from deep metric learning and\nself-supervised learning show that optimal hyper-parameters are found faster\nwith our method than with other common search methods.",

It is commonplace for\nhumans to discriminatively localize different sounding objects but quite\nchallenging for machines to achieve class-aware sounding objects localization\nwithout category annotations, i.e., localizing the sounding object and\nrecognizing its category. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage\nstep-by-step learning framework to localize and recognize sounding objects in\ncomplex audiovisual scenarios using only the correspondence between audio and\nvision. First, we propose to determine the sounding area via coarse-grained\naudiovisual correspondence in the single source cases. Then visual features in\nthe sounding area are leveraged as candidate object representations to\nestablish a category-representation object dictionary for expressive visual\ncharacter extraction. We generate class-aware object localization maps in\ncocktail-party scenarios and use audiovisual correspondence to suppress silent\nareas by referring to this dictionary. Finally, we employ category-level\naudiovisual consistency as the supervision to achieve fine-grained audio and\nsounding object distribution alignment. Experiments on both realistic and\nsynthesized videos show that our model is superior in localizing and\nrecognizing objects as well as filtering out silent ones. We also transfer the\nlearned audiovisual network into the unsupervised object detection task,\nobtaining reasonable performance.",

    "abstract": "Conversational recommendation system (CRS) is able to obtain fine-grained and\ndynamic user preferences based on interactive dialogue. Previous CRS assumes\nthat the user has a clear target item. However, for many users who resort to\nCRS, they might not have a clear idea about what they really like.\nSpecifically, the user may have a clear single preference for some attribute\ntypes (e.g. color) of items, while for other attribute types, the user may have\nmultiple preferences or even no clear preferences, which leads to multiple\nacceptable attribute instances (e.g. black and red) of one attribute type.\nTherefore, the users could show their preferences over items under multiple\ncombinations of attribute instances rather than a single item with unique\ncombination of all attribute instances. As a result, we first propose a more\nrealistic CRS learning setting, namely Multi-Interest Multi-round\nConversational Recommendation, where users may have multiple interests in\nattribute instance combinations and accept multiple items with partially\noverlapped combinations of attribute instances. To effectively cope with the\nnew CRS learning setting, in this paper, we propose a novel learning framework\nnamely, Multi-Choice questions based Multi-Interest Policy Learning . In order\nto obtain user preferences more efficiently, the agent generates multi-choice\nquestions rather than binary yes/no ones on specific attribute instance.\nBesides, we propose a union set strategy to select candidate items instead of\nexisting intersection set strategy in order to overcome over-filtering items\nduring the conversation. Finally, we design a Multi-Interest Policy Learning\nmodule, which utilizes captured multiple interests of the user to decide next\naction, either asking attribute instances or recommending items.

    "abstract": "Image denoising is of vital importance in many imaging or computer vision\nrelated areas. With the convolutional neural networks showing strong capability\nin computer vision tasks, the performance of image denoising has also been\nbrought up by CNN based methods. Though CNN based image denoisers show\npromising results on this task, most of the current CNN based methods try to\nlearn the mapping from noisy image to clean image directly, which lacks the\nexplicit exploration of prior knowledge of images and noises. Natural images\nare observed to obey the reciprocal power law, implying the low-frequency band\nof image tend to occupy most of the energy. Thus in the condition of AGWN\n(additive gaussian white noise) deterioration, low-frequency band tend to\npreserve a higher PSNR than high-frequency band. Considering the spatial\nmorphological consistency of different frequency bands, low-frequency band with\nmore fidelity can be used as a guidance to refine the more contaminated\nhigh-frequency bands. Based on this thought, we proposed a novel network\narchitecture denoted as IGNet, in order to refine the frequency bands from low\nto high in a progressive manner. Firstly, it decomposes the feature maps into\nhigh- and low-frequency subbands using DWT (discrete wavelet transform)\niteratively, and then each low band features are used to refine the high band\nfeatures. Finally, the refined feature maps are processed by a decoder to\nrecover the clean result. With this design, more inter-frequency prior and\ninformation are utilized, thus the model size can be lightened while still\nperserves competitive results. Experiments on several public datasets show that\nour model obtains competitive performance comparing with other state-of-the-art\nmethods yet with a lightweight structure.",

Assuming $\\mathsf{CT}$ and countable\nchoice invalidates the law of excluded middle, thereby also invalidating\nclassical intuitions prevalent in textbooks on computability. On the other\nhand, results like Rice's theorem are not provable without a form of choice. In\ncontrast to existing work, we base our investigations in constructive type\ntheory with a separate, impredicative universe of propositions where countable\nchoice does not hold and thus a priori $\\mathsf{CT}_{\\phi}$ and the law of\nexcluded middle seem to be consistent. We introduce various parametric\nstrengthenings of $\\mathsf{CT}_{\\phi}$, which are equivalent to assuming\n$\\mathsf{CT}_\\phi$ and an $S^m_n$ operator for $\\phi$ like in the $S^m_n$\ntheorem. The strengthened axioms allow developing synthetic computability\ntheory without choice, as demonstrated by elegant synthetic proofs of Rice's\ntheorem.

The proposed code overcomes two major\nshortcomings of the previously proposed DNN-based codes over channels with\npassive output feedback: (i) the SNR-aware attention mechanism at the decoder\nenables reliable application of the same trained NN over a wide range of SNR\nvalues; (ii) curriculum training with batch-size scheduling is used to speed up\nand stabilize training while improving the SNR-robustness of the resulting\ncode. We show that the DRF codes significantly outperform state-of-the-art in\nterms of both the SNR-robustness and the error rate in additive white Gaussian\nnoise (AWGN) channel with feedback. In fading channels with perfect phase\ncompensation at the receiver, DRF codes learn to efficiently exploit knowledge\nof the instantaneous fading amplitude (which is available to the encoder\nthrough feedback) to reduce the overhead and complexity associated with channel\nestimation at the decoder. Finally, we show the effectiveness of DRF codes in\nmulticast channels with feedback, where linear feedback codes are known to be\nstrictly suboptimal.",

    "title": "BEVDet: High-performance Multi-camera 3D Object Detection in  Bird-Eye-View",
    "abstract": "Autonomous driving perceives the surrounding environment for decision making,\nwhich is one of the most complicated scenes for visual perception. The great\npower of paradigm innovation in solving the 2D object detection task inspires\nus to seek an elegant, feasible, and scalable paradigm for pushing the\nperformance boundary in this area. To this end, we contribute the BEVDet\nparadigm in this paper. BEVDet is developed by following the principle of\ndetecting the 3D objects in Bird-Eye-View (BEV), where route planning can be\nhandily performed. In this paradigm, four kinds of modules are conducted in\nsuccession with different roles: an image-view encoder for encoding feature in\nimage view, a view transformer for feature transformation from image view to\nBEV, a BEV encoder for further encoding feature in BEV, and a task-specific\nhead for predicting the targets in BEV. We merely reuse the existing modules\nfor constructing BEVDet and make it feasible for multi-camera 3D object\ndetection by constructing an exclusive data augmentation strategy. The proposed\nparadigm works well in multi-camera 3D object detection and offers a good\ntrade-off between computing budget and performance. BEVDet with 704x256 (1/8 of\nthe competitors) image size scores 29.4% mAP and 38.4% NDS on the nuScenes val\nset, which is comparable with FCOS3D (i.e., 2008.2 GFLOPs, 1.7 FPS, 29.5% mAP\nand 37.2% NDS), while requires merely 12% computing budget of 239.4 GFLOPs and\nruns 4.3 times faster. Scaling up the input size to 1408x512, BEVDet scores\n34.9% mAP, and 41.7% NDS, which requires just 601.4 GFLOPs and significantly\nsuppresses FCOS3D by 5.4% mAP and 4.5% NDS. The superior performance of BEVDet\ntells the magic of paradigm innovation.",

The integration domain\n$\\Gamma\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n$ is assumed to be the compact attractor of an\niterated function system of contracting similarities satisfying the open set\ncondition. Integration is with respect to the Hausdorff measure\n$\\mathcal{H}^d$, where $d$ is the Hausdorff dimension of $\\Gamma$, and both\nsingle and double integrals are considered. Our focus is on composite\nquadrature rules in which integrals over $\\Gamma$ are decomposed into sums of\nintegrals over suitable partitions of $\\Gamma$ into self-similar\nsub-components. For certain singular integrands of logarithmic or algebraic\ntype we show how in the context of such a partitioning the self-similarity of\n$\\Gamma$ can be exploited to express the singular integral exactly in terms of\nregular integrals. For the evaluation of these regular integrals we adopt a\ncomposite barycentre rule, which for sufficiently regular integrands exhibits\nsecond-order convergence with respect to the maximum diameter of the\nsub-components. As an application we show how this approach, combined with a\nsingularity-subtraction technique, can be used to accurately evaluate the\nsingular double integrals that arise in Hausdorff-measure Galerkin boundary\nelement methods for acoustic wave scattering by fractal screens.",

While our naked eyes are able to\nextract contextual information almost instantly, even from far away, image\nresolution and computational resources limitations make detecting smaller\nobjects (that is, objects that occupy a small pixel area in the input image) a\ngenuinely challenging task for machines and a wide-open research field.

    "abstract": "The basic goal of survivable network design is to build cheap networks that\nguarantee the connectivity of certain pairs of nodes despite the failure of a\nfew edges or nodes. A celebrated result by Jain [Combinatorica'01] provides a\n2-approximation for a wide class of these problems. However nothing better is\nknown even for very basic special cases, raising the natural question whether\nany improved approximation factor is possible at all.\nIn this paper we address one of the most basic problems in this family for\nwhich 2 is still the best-known approximation factor, the Forest Augmentation\nProblem (FAP): given an undirected unweighted graph (that w.l.o.g. is a forest)\nand a collection of extra edges (links), compute a minimum cardinality subset\nof links whose addition to the graph makes it 2-edge-connected. Several\nbetter-than-2 approximation algorithms are known for the special case where the\ninput graph is a tree, a.k.a. the Tree Augmentation Problem (TAP). Recently\nthis was achieved also for the weighted version of TAP, and for the\nk-edge-connectivity generalization of TAP. These results heavily exploit the\nfact that the input graph is connected, a condition that does not hold in FAP.\nIn this paper we breach the 2-approximation barrier for FAP. Our result is\nbased on two main ingredients. First, we describe a reduction to the Path\nAugmentation Problem (PAP), the special case of FAP where the input graph is a\ncollection of disjoint paths. Our reduction is not approximation preserving,\nhowever it is sufficiently accurate to improve on a factor 2 approximation.\nSecond, we present a better-than-2 approximation algorithm for PAP, an open\nproblem on its own.

    "abstract": "Mobile edge computing facilitates users to offload computation tasks to edge\nservers for meeting their stringent delay requirements. Previous works mainly\nexplore task offloading when system-side information is given (e.g., server\nprocessing speed, cellular data rate), or centralized offloading under system\nuncertainty. But both generally fall short to handle task placement involving\nmany coexisting users in a dynamic and uncertain environment. In this paper, we\ndevelop a multi-user offloading framework considering unknown yet stochastic\nsystem-side information to enable a decentralized user-initiated service\nplacement. Specifically, we formulate the dynamic task placement as an online\nmulti-user multi-armed bandit process, and propose a decentralized epoch based\noffloading (DEBO) to optimize user rewards which are subjected under network\ndelay. We show that DEBO can deduce the optimal user-server assignment, thereby\nachieving a close-to-optimal service performance and tight O(log T) offloading\nregret. Moreover, we generalize DEBO to various common scenarios such as\nunknown reward gap, dynamic entering or leaving of clients, and fair reward\ndistribution, while further exploring when users' offloaded tasks require\nheterogeneous computing resources. Particularly, we accomplish a sub-linear\nregret for each of these instances. Real measurements based evaluations\ncorroborate the superiority of our offloading schemes over state-of-the-art\napproaches in optimizing delay-sensitive rewards.",

For graph/metric problems,\nthere can be two types of error, locations that are not predicted, and\nlocations that are predicted but the predicted and actual locations do not\ncoincide exactly. We design a novel definition of prediction error called\nmetric error with outliers to simultaneously capture both types of errors,\nwhich thereby generalizes previous definitions of error that only capture one\nof the two error types.\n* We give a general framework for obtaining online algorithms with\npredictions that combines, in a \"black box\" fashion, existing online and\noffline algorithms, under certain technical conditions.

Finally,\nthe limitations of the existing methods are highlighted, and guidelines of the\nfuture research directions are given.",

    "abstract": "Template-based discriminative trackers are currently the dominant tracking\nparadigm due to their robustness, but are restricted to bounding box tracking\nand a limited range of transformation models, which reduces their localization\naccuracy. We propose a discriminative single-shot segmentation tracker -- D3S2,\nwhich narrows the gap between visual object tracking and video object\nsegmentation. A single-shot network applies two target models with\ncomplementary geometric properties, one invariant to a broad range of\ntransformations, including non-rigid deformations, the other assuming a rigid\nobject to simultaneously achieve robust online target segmentation. The overall\ntracking reliability is further increased by decoupling the object and feature\nscale estimation. Without per-dataset finetuning, and trained only for\nsegmentation as the primary output, D3S2 outperforms all published trackers on\nthe recent short-term tracking benchmark VOT2020 and performs very close to the\nstate-of-the-art trackers on the GOT-10k, TrackingNet, OTB100 and LaSoT.

    "abstract": "Despite the importance and pervasiveness of Wikipedia as one of the largest\nplatforms for open knowledge, surprisingly little is known about how people\nnavigate its content when seeking information. To bridge this gap, we present\nthe first systematic large-scale analysis of how readers browse Wikipedia.\nUsing billions of page requests from Wikipedia's server logs, we measure how\nreaders reach articles, how they transition between articles, and how these\npatterns combine into more complex navigation paths. We find that navigation\nbehavior is characterized by highly diverse structures. Although most\nnavigation paths are shallow, comprising a single pageload, there is much\nvariety, and the depth and shape of paths vary systematically with topic,\ndevice type, and time of day. We show that Wikipedia navigation paths commonly\nmesh with external pages as part of a larger online ecosystem, and we describe\nhow naturally occurring navigation paths are distinct from targeted navigation\nin lab-based settings. Our results further suggest that navigation is abandoned\nwhen readers reach low-quality pages. These findings not only help in\nidentifying potential improvements to reader experience on Wikipedia, but also\nin better understanding of how people seek knowledge on the Web.",

    "abstract": "Automatic few-shot font generation aims to solve a well-defined, real-world\nproblem because manual font designs are expensive and sensitive to the\nexpertise of designers. Existing methods learn to disentangle style and content\nelements by developing a universal style representation for each font style.\nHowever, this approach limits the model in representing diverse local styles,\nbecause it is unsuitable for complicated letter systems, for example, Chinese,\nwhose characters consist of a varying number of components (often called\n\"radical\") -- with a highly complex structure. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel font generation method that learns localized styles, namely\ncomponent-wise style representations, instead of universal styles. The proposed\nstyle representations enable the synthesis of complex local details in text\ndesigns. However, learning component-wise styles solely from a few reference\nglyphs is infeasible when a target script has a large number of components, for\nexample, over 200 for Chinese. To reduce the number of required reference\nglyphs, we represent component-wise styles by a product of component and style\nfactors, inspired by low-rank matrix factorization. Owing to the combination of\nstrong representation and a compact factorization strategy, our method shows\nremarkably better few-shot font generation results (with only eight reference\nglyphs) than other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, strong locality\nsupervision, for example, location of each component, skeleton, or strokes, was\nnot utilized.

We first analyze the theoretical capability of the\nstandard Transformer architecture to learn tree structures given enumeration of\nall possible tree backbones, which we define as trees without labels. We then\nprove that two linear layers with ReLU activation function can recover any tree\nbackbone from any two nonzero, linearly independent starting backbones.

    "abstract": "Product copywriting is a critical component of e-commerce recommendation\nplatforms. It aims to attract users' interest and improve user experience by\nhighlighting product characteristics with textual descriptions. In this paper,\nwe report our experience deploying the proposed Automatic Product Copywriting\nGeneration (APCG) system into the JD.com e-commerce product recommendation\nplatform. It consists of two main components: 1) natural language generation,\nwhich is built from a transformer-pointer network and a pre-trained\nsequence-to-sequence model based on millions of training data from our in-house\nplatform; and 2) copywriting quality control, which is based on both automatic\nevaluation and human screening. For selected domains, the models are trained\nand updated daily with the updated training data. In addition, the model is\nalso used as a real-time writing assistant tool on our live broadcast platform.\nThe APCG system has been deployed in JD.com since Feb 2021. By Sep 2021, it has\ngenerated 2.53 million product descriptions, and improved the overall averaged\nclick-through rate (CTR) and the Conversion Rate (CVR) by 4.22% and 3.61%,\ncompared to baselines, respectively on a year-on-year basis. The accumulated\nGross Merchandise Volume (GMV) made by our system is improved by 213.42%,\ncompared to the number in Feb 2021.",

    "abstract": "Data augmentation has been an important ingredient for boosting performances\nof learned models. Prior data augmentation methods for few-shot text\nclassification have led to great performance boosts. However, they have not\nbeen designed to capture the intricate compositional structure of natural\nlanguage. As a result, they fail to generate samples with plausible and diverse\nsentence structures. Motivated by this, we present the data Augmentation using\nLexicalized Probabilistic context-free grammars (ALP) that generates augmented\nsamples with diverse syntactic structures with plausible grammar. The\nlexicalized PCFG parse trees consider both the constituents and dependencies to\nproduce a syntactic frame that maximizes a variety of word choices in a\nsyntactically preservable manner without specific domain experts. Experiments\non few-shot text classification tasks demonstrate that ALP enhances many\nstate-of-the-art classification methods. As a second contribution, we delve\ninto the train-val splitting methodologies when a data augmentation method\ncomes into play. We argue empirically that the traditional splitting of\ntraining and validation sets is sub-optimal compared to our novel\naugmentation-based splitting strategies that further expand the training split\nwith the same number of labeled data. Taken together, our contributions on the\ndata augmentation strategies yield a strong training recipe for few-shot text\nclassification tasks.",

In this paper we present a\nnew framework for designing AEs for this purpose. In particular, we present an\nAE framework, namely listAE, in which the decoder network outputs a list of\ndecoded message word candidates. A genie is assumed to be available at the\noutput of the decoder and specific loss functions are proposed to optimize the\nperformance of the genie-aided (GA)-listAE. The listAE is a general AE\nframework and can be used with any network architecture. We propose a specific\nend-to-end network architecture which decodes the received word on a sequence\nof component codes with decreasing rates. The listAE based on the proposed\narchitecture, referred to as incremental redundancy listAE (IR-listAE),\nimproves the state-of-the-art AE performance by 1 dB at low block error rates\nunder GA decoding. We then employ cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes to\nreplace the genie at the decoder, giving CRC-aided (CA)-listAE with negligible\nperformance loss compared to the GA-listAE. The CA-listAE shows meaningful\ncoding gain at the price of a slight decrease in the rate due to appending CRC\nto the message word.",

Given a directed graph with non-negative edge\nweights, our goal is to compute a shortest path from a given source node to any\nof several designated target nodes. Basically, our idea is to combine a machine\nlearning approach with an adapted version of Dijkstra's algorithm to solve this\nproblem: Based on the trace of Dijkstra's algorithm, we design a neural network\nthat predicts the shortest path distance after only a few iterations. The\nprediction is then used to prune the search space explored by Dijkstra's\nalgorithm, which allows us to save a significant fraction of operations on the\nunderlying priority queue. Crucially, our approach always computes the exact\nshortest path distances, even if the prediction is inaccurate, and never uses\nmore queue operations than the standard algorithm. In fact, we are able to\nprove a lower bound on the number of queue operations saved by our new\nalgorithm, which depends on the accuracy of the prediction.

In parallel, of course, the demand for measurability and comparability\nhas emerged among decision-makers and scholars.

We aim to\nmaximize its sum-rate via the joint optimization of beamforming at the BS and\nphase shifts at the RIS. However, the multi-user MIMO transmissions and the\nspatial correlations make the optimization cumbersome. For tractability, a\ndeterministic approximation is derived for the sum-rate under a large number of\nthe reflecting elements. By adopting the approximate sum-rate for maximization,\nthe optimal designs of the transmit beamforming and the phase shifts can be\ndecoupled and solved in closed-forms individually. More specifically, the\nglobal optimality of the transmit beamforming can be guaranteed by using the\nwater-filling algorithm and a sub-optimal solution of phase shifts can be\nobtained by using the projected gradient ascent (PGA) algorithm. By comparing\nto the case of the instantaneous CSI assumed at the BS, the proposed algorithm\nbased on statistical CSI can achieve comparable performance but with much lower\ncomplexity and signaling overhead, which is more affordable and appealing for\npractical applications.

In addition,\nwe evaluate several state-of-the-art baseline models and explore a multi-level\nknowledge adapter to effectively incorporate profile information. Experimental\nresults reveal that all existing text-based SLU models fail to work when the\nutterances are semantically ambiguous and our proposed framework can\neffectively fuse the supporting information for sentence-level intent detection\nand token-level slot filling.

We give a proof that the\ngiven algorithms preserve the interface after interface deformation and\nremeshing steps. Originating from various numerical methods, data is attached\ncell-wise to the mesh. After each remeshing operation the interface preserving\nmoving mesh retains valid data by projecting the data to the new mesh\ncells.\\newline An open source implementation of the moving mesh algorithm is\navailable at [1].",

Although\na simplified version of optimal transport in Wasserstein spaces, called linear\noptimal transport (LOT), was successfully used in certain applications, there\ndoes not exist a notation of linear Gromov-Wasserstein distances so far. In\nthis paper, we propose a definition of linear Gromov-Wasserstein distances. We\nmotivate our approach by a generalized LOT model, which is based on barycentric\nprojections.

Via a simple threat model which causes random deceleration attacks\n(RDAs), compromised vehicles create congestion waves in the traffic that\ndecrease average speed and network throughput. We use a detailed and realistic\ntraffic simulation environment to quantify the impacts of the attack on a model\nof a real high-volume freeway in the United States. We find that the effect of\nthe attack depends both on the level of underlying traffic congestion, and what\npercentage of ACC vehicles can be compromised. In moderate congestion regimes\nthe attack can degrade mean commuter speed by over 7%. In high density regimes\noverall network throughput can be reduced by up to 3%. And, in moderate to high\ncongestion regimes, it can cost commuters on the network over 300 USD/km hr.\nAll of these results motivate that the proposed attack is able to significantly\ndegrade performance of the traffic network.\nWe also develop an anomaly detection technique that uses GPS traces on\nvehicles to identify malicious/compromised vehicles. We employ this technique\non data from the simulation experiments and find that it is unable to identify\ncompromised ACCs compared to benign/normal drivers. That is, these attacks are\nstealthy to detection.

However, the system-heterogeneity is one major\nchallenge in a FL network to achieve robust distributed learning performance,\nwhich is of two aspects: i) device-heterogeneity due to the diverse\ncomputational capacity among devices; ii) data-heterogeneity due to the\nnon-identically distributed data across the network. Though there have been\nbenchmarks against the heterogeneous FL, e.g., FedProx, the prior studies lack\nformalization and it remains an open problem.

To achieve this, FedLGA provides an alternated\nHessian estimation method, which only requires extra linear complexity on the\naggregator.

    "title": "Learning and Crafting for the Wide Multiple Baseline Stereo",
    "abstract": "This thesis introduces the wide multiple baseline stereo (WxBS) problem.\nWxBS, a generalization of the standard wide baseline stereo problem, considers\nthe matching of images that simultaneously differ in more than one image\nacquisition factor such as viewpoint, illumination, sensor type, or where\nobject appearance changes significantly, e.g., over time. A new dataset with\nthe ground truth, evaluation metric and baselines has been introduced.\nThe thesis presents the following improvements of the WxBS pipeline. (i) A\nloss function, called HardNeg, for learning a local image descriptor that\nrelies on hard negative mining within a mini-batch and on the maximization of\nthe distance between the closest positive and the closest negative patches.\n(ii) The descriptor trained with the HardNeg loss, called HardNet, is compact\nand shows state-of-the-art performance in standard matching, patch verification\nand retrieval benchmarks. (iii) A method for learning the affine shape,\norientation, and potentially other parameters related to geometric and\nappearance properties of local features. (iv) A tentative correspondences\ngeneration strategy which generalizes the standard first to second closest\ndistance ratio is presented. The selection strategy, which shows performance\nsuperior to the standard method, is applicable to either hard-engineered\ndescriptors like SIFT, LIOP, and MROGH or deeply learned like HardNet. (v) A\nfeedback loop is introduced for the two-view matching problem, resulting in\nMODS -- matching with on-demand view synthesis -- algorithm. MODS is an\nalgorithm that handles a viewing angle difference even larger than the previous\nstate-of-the-art ASIFT algorithm, without a significant increase of\ncomputational cost over \"standard\" wide and narrow baseline approaches. Last,\nbut not least, a comprehensive benchmark for local features and robust\nestimation algorithms is introduced.",

    "abstract": "Most of the speech recognition systems recover only words in the speech and\nfail to capture emotions. Users have to manually add emoji(s) in text for\nadding tone and making communication fun. Though there is much work done on\npunctuation addition on transcribed speech, the area of emotion addition is\nuntouched. In this paper, we propose a novel on-device pipeline to enrich the\nvoice input experience. It involves, given a blob of transcribed text,\nintelligently processing and identifying structure where emoji insertion makes\nsense. Moreover, it includes semantic text analysis to predict emoji for each\nof the sub-parts for which we propose a novel architecture Attention-based Char\nAware (ACA) LSTM which handles Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words as well. All these\ntasks are executed completely on-device and hence can aid on-device dictation\nsystems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that shows how to\nadd emoji(s) in the transcribed text. We demonstrate that our components\nachieve comparable results to previous neural approaches for punctuation\naddition and emoji prediction with 80% fewer parameters. Overall, our proposed\nmodel has a very small memory footprint of a mere 4MB to suit on-device\ndeployment.",

    "abstract": "Makaro is a logic puzzle with an objective to fill numbers into a rectangular\ngrid to satisfy certain conditions. In 2018, Bultel et al. developed a physical\nzero-knowledge proof (ZKP) protocol for Makaro using a deck of cards, which\nallows a prover to physically convince a verifier that he/she knows a solution\nof the puzzle without revealing it. However, their protocol requires several\nidentical copies of some cards, making it impractical as a deck of playing\ncards found in everyday life typically consists of all different cards. In this\npaper, we propose a new ZKP protocol for Makaro that can be implemented using a\nstandard deck (a deck consisting of all different cards). Our protocol also\nuses asymptotically less cards than the protocol of Bultel et al. Most\nimportantly, we develop a general method to encode a number with a sequence of\nall different cards. This allows us to securely compute several numerical\nfunctions using a standard deck, such as verifying that two given numbers are\ndifferent and verifying that a number is the largest one among the given\nnumbers.",

    "abstract": "The recent availability of electronic health records (EHRs) have provided\nenormous opportunities to develop artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.\nHowever, patient privacy has become a major concern that limits data sharing\nacross hospital settings and subsequently hinders the advances in AI.\n\\textit{Synthetic data}, which benefits from the development and proliferation\nof generative models, has served as a promising substitute for real patient EHR\ndata. However, the current generative models are limited as they only generate\n\\textit{single type} of clinical data, i.e., either continuous-valued or\ndiscrete-valued. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network\n(GAN) entitled EHR-M-GAN which synthesizes \\textit{mixed-type} timeseries EHR\ndata. EHR-M-GAN is capable of capturing the multidimensional, heterogeneous,\nand correlated temporal dynamics in patient trajectories. We have validated\nEHR-M-GAN on three publicly-available intensive care unit databases with\nrecords from a total of 141,488 unique patients, and performed privacy risk\nevaluation of the proposed model. EHR-M-GAN has demonstrated its superiority in\nperformance over state-of-the-art benchmarks for synthesizing clinical\ntimeseries with high fidelity. Notably, prediction models for outcomes of\nintensive care performed significantly better when training data was augmented\nwith the addition of EHR-M-GAN-generated timeseries.

    "abstract": "We present a field-based method of toolpath generation for 3D printing\ncontinuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites. Our method employs the\nstrong anisotropic material property of continuous fibres by generating\ntoolpaths along the directions of tensile stresses in the critical regions.\nMoreover, the density of toolpath distribution is controlled in an adaptive way\nproportionally to the values of stresses. Specifically, a vector field is\ngenerated from the stress tensors under given loads and processed to have\nbetter compatibility between neighboring vectors. An optimal scalar field is\ncomputed later by making its gradients approximate the vector field. After\nthat, isocurves of the scalar field are extracted to generate the toolpaths for\ncontinuous fibre reinforcement, which are also integrated with the boundary\nconformal toolpaths in user selected regions. The performance of our method has\nbeen verified on a variety of models in different loading conditions.\nExperimental tests are conducted on specimens by 3D printing continuous carbon\nfibres (CCF) in a polylactic acid (PLA) matrix. Compared to reinforcement by\nload-independent toolpaths, the specimens fabricated by our method show up to\n71.4% improvement on the mechanical strength in physical tests when using the\nsame (or even slightly smaller) amount of continuous fibres.",

    "abstract": "In warehouses, order picking is known to be the most labor-intensive and\ncostly task in which the employees account for a large part of the warehouse\nperformance. Hence, many approaches exist, that optimize the order picking\nprocess based on diverse economic criteria. However, most of these approaches\nfocus on a single economic objective at once and disregard ergonomic criteria\nin their optimization. Further, the influence of the placement of the items to\nbe picked is underestimated and accordingly, too little attention is paid to\nthe interdependence of these two problems. In this work, we aim at optimizing\nthe storage assignment and the order picking problem within mezzanine warehouse\nwith regards to their reciprocal influence. We propose a customized version of\nthe Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) for optimizing the\nstorage assignment problem as well as an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)\nalgorithm for optimizing the order picking problem. Both algorithms incorporate\nmultiple economic and ergonomic constraints simultaneously. Furthermore, the\nalgorithms incorporate knowledge about the interdependence between both\nproblems, aiming to improve the overall warehouse performance. Our evaluation\nresults show that our proposed algorithms return better storage assignments and\norder pick routes compared to commonly used techniques for the following\nquality indicators for comparing Pareto fronts: Coverage, Generational\nDistance, Euclidian Distance, Pareto Front Size, and Inverted Generational\nDistance.

The accurate soil moisture (state) estimation is critical in\nimplementing the closed-loop irrigation of agrohydrological systems. In\ngeneral, the agricultural fields are high dimensional systems. Due to the high\ndimensionality for a large field, it is very challenging to solve an\noptimizationbased advanced state estimator like moving horizon estimation\n(MHE).

The proposed\nalgorithms are applied to a small simulated field to compare the performance of\nadaptive MHE over original MHE. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to a\nlarge-scale real agricultural field to test the effectiveness and superiority\nto address the current challenges.

Based on experiments\ndone with CoLU with different activation functions, it is observed that CoLU\nusually performs better than other functions on deeper neural networks. While\ntraining different neural networks on MNIST on an incrementally increasing\nnumber of convolutional layers, CoLU retained the highest accuracy for more\nlayers. On a smaller network with 8 convolutional layers, CoLU had the highest\nmean accuracy, closely followed by ReLU. On VGG-13 trained on Fashion-MNIST,\nCoLU had a 4.20% higher accuracy than Mish and 3.31% higher accuracy than ReLU.\nOn ResNet-9 trained on Cifar-10, CoLU had 0.05% higher accuracy than Swish,\n0.09% higher accuracy than Mish, and 0.29% higher accuracy than ReLU. It is\nobserved that activation functions may behave better than other activation\nfunctions based on different factors including the number of layers, types of\nlayers, number of parameters, learning rate, optimizer, etc. Further research\ncan be done on these factors and activation functions for more optimal\nactivation functions and more knowledge on their behavior.",

    "title": "A New Adaptive Noise Covariance Matrices Estimation and Filtering  Method: Application to Multi-Object Tracking",
    "abstract": "Kalman filters are widely used for object tracking, where process and\nmeasurement noise are usually considered accurately known and constant.\nHowever, the exact known and constant assumptions do not always hold in\npractice. For example, when lidar is used to track noncooperative targets, the\nmeasurement noise is different under different distances and weather\nconditions. In addition, the process noise changes with the object's motion\nstate, especially when the tracking object is a pedestrian, and the process\nnoise changes more frequently. This paper proposes a new\nestimation-calibration-correction closed-loop estimation method to estimate the\nKalman filter process and measurement noise covariance matrices online. First,\nwe decompose the noise covariance matrix into an element distribution matrix\nand noise intensity and improve the Sage filter to estimate the element\ndistribution matrix. Second, we propose a calibration method to accurately\ndiagnose the noise intensity deviation. We then propose a correct method to\nadaptively correct the noise intensity online. Third, under the assumption that\nthe system is detectable, the unbiased and convergence of the proposed method\nis mathematically proven. Simulation results prove the effectiveness and\nreliability of the proposed method. Finally, we apply the proposed method to\nmultiobject tracking of lidar and evaluate it on the official KITTI server. The\nproposed method on the KITTI pedestrian multiobject tracking leaderboard\n(this http URL /kitti/eval_tracking.php) surpasses all\nexisting methods using lidar, proving the feasibility of the method in\npractical applications. This work provides a new way to improve the performance\nof the Kalman filter and multiobject tracking.",

    "abstract": "Although randomized smoothing has demonstrated high certified robustness and\nsuperior scalability to other certified defenses, the high computational\noverhead of the robustness certification bottlenecks the practical\napplicability, as it depends heavily on the large sample approximation for\nestimating the confidence interval. In existing works, the sample size for the\nconfidence interval is universally set and agnostic to the input for\nprediction. This Input-Agnostic Sampling (IAS) scheme may yield a poor Average\nCertified Radius (ACR)-runtime trade-off which calls for improvement. In this\npaper, we propose Input-Specific Sampling (ISS) acceleration to achieve the\ncost-effectiveness for robustness certification, in an adaptive way of reducing\nthe sampling size based on the input characteristic. Furthermore, our method\nuniversally controls the certified radius decline from the ISS sample size\nreduction. The empirical results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that ISS can\nspeed up the certification by more than three times at a limited cost of 0.05\ncertified radius. Meanwhile, ISS surpasses IAS on the average certified radius\nacross the extensive hyperparameter settings. Specifically, ISS achieves\nACR=0.958 on ImageNet ($\\sigma=1.0$) in 250 minutes, compared to ACR=0.917 by\nIAS under the same condition.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art deep learning approaches for skin lesion recognition often\nrequire pretraining on larger and more varied datasets, to overcome the\ngeneralization limitations derived from the reduced size of the skin lesion\nimaging datasets. ImageNet is often used as the pretraining dataset, but its\ntransferring potential is hindered by the domain gap between the source dataset\nand the target dermatoscopic scenario. In this work, we introduce a novel\npretraining approach that sequentially trains a series of Self-Supervised\nLearning pretext tasks and only requires the unlabeled skin lesion imaging\ndata. We present a simple methodology to establish an ordering that defines a\npretext task curriculum. For the multi-class skin lesion classification\nproblem, and ISIC-2019 dataset, we provide experimental evidence showing that:\ni) a model pretrained by a curriculum of pretext tasks outperforms models\npretrained by individual pretext tasks, and ii) a model pretrained by the\noptimal pretext task curriculum outperforms a model pretrained on ImageNet. We\ndemonstrate that this performance gain is related to the fact that the\ncurriculum of pretext tasks better focuses the attention of the final model on\nthe skin lesion. Beyond performance improvement, this strategy allows for a\nlarge reduction in the training time with respect to ImageNet pretraining,\nwhich is especially advantageous for network architectures tailored for a\nspecific problem.",

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs), that operate via binary spikes distributed\nover time, have emerged as a promising energy efficient ML paradigm for\nresource-constrained devices. However, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) SNNs\nrequire multiple time steps for acceptable inference accuracy, increasing\nspiking activity and, consequently, energy consumption. SOTA training\nstrategies for SNNs involve conversion from a non-spiking deep neural network\n(DNN). In this paper, we determine that SOTA conversion strategies cannot yield\nultra low latency because they incorrectly assume that the DNN and SNN\npre-activation values are uniformly distributed. We propose a new training\nalgorithm that accurately captures these distributions, minimizing the error\nbetween the DNN and converted SNN. The resulting SNNs have ultra low latency\nand high activation sparsity, yielding significant improvements in compute\nefficiency. In particular, we evaluate our framework on image recognition tasks\nfrom CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets on several VGG and ResNet architectures.\nWe obtain top-1 accuracy of 64.19% with only 2 time steps on the CIFAR-100\ndataset with ~159.2x lower compute energy compared to an iso-architecture\nstandard DNN.

    "abstract": "We design an open-vocabulary image segmentation model to organize an image\ninto meaningful regions indicated by arbitrary texts. We identify that recent\nopen-vocabulary models can not localize visual concepts well despite\nrecognizing what are in an image. We argue that these models miss an important\nstep of visual grouping, which organizes pixels into groups before learning\nvisual-semantic alignments. We propose OpenSeg to address the above issue.\nFirst, it learns to propose segmentation masks for possible organizations. Then\nit learns visual-semantic alignments by aligning each word in a caption to one\nor a few predicted masks. We find the mask representations are the key to\nsupport learning from captions, making it possible to scale up the dataset and\nvocabulary sizes. Our work is the first to perform zero-shot transfer on\nholdout segmentation datasets. We set up two strong baselines by applying class\nactivation maps or fine-tuning with pixel-wise labels on a pre-trained ALIGN\nmodel. OpenSeg outperforms these baselines by 3.4 mIoU on PASCAL-Context (459\nclasses) and 2.7 mIoU on ADE-20k (847 classes).",

The Multi-Coil Magnetic Resonance Image (MC-MRI)\nReconstruction Challenge provides a benchmark that aims at addressing these\nissues, using a large dataset of high-resolution, three-dimensional,\nT1-weighted MRI scans. The challenge has two primary goals: 1) to compare\ndifferent MRI reconstruction models on this dataset and 2) to assess the\ngeneralizability of these models to data acquired with a different number of\nreceiver coils. In this paper, we describe the challenge experimental design,\nand summarize the results of a set of baseline and state of the art brain MRI\nreconstruction models. We provide relevant comparative information on the\ncurrent MRI reconstruction state-of-the-art and highlight the challenges of\nobtaining generalizable models that are required prior to broader clinical\nadoption.

The complex\ninterplay of different articulators during speech production and realization of\nrequired muscle tension become increasingly difficult, thus leading to a\ndysarthric speech. Characteristic patterns such as vowel instability, slurred\npronunciation and slow speech can often be observed in the affected individuals\nand were analyzed in previous studies to determine the presence and progression\nof PD. In this work, we used a phonetic recognizer trained exclusively on\nhealthy speech data to investigate how PD affected the phonetic footprint of\npatients. We rediscovered numerous patterns that had been described in previous\ncontributions although our system had never seen any pathological speech\npreviously. Furthermore, we could show that intermediate activations from the\nneural network could serve as feature vectors encoding information related to\nthe disease state of individuals. We were also able to directly correlate the\nexpert-rated intelligibility of a speaker with the mean confidence of phonetic\npredictions.

Convolutional neural networks may be suited for such tasks, but\nrequire substantial amounts of labeled data to train. Obtaining labeled data is\na challenge, especially in the medical domain. Methods: This paper investigates\nthe use of a teacher-student design to utilize datasets with different types of\nsupervision to train an automatic model performing pulmonary tumor segmentation\non computed tomography images. The framework consists of two models: the\nstudent that performs end-to-end automatic tumor segmentation and the teacher\nthat supplies the student additional pseudo-annotated data during training.\nResults: Using only a small proportion of semantically labeled data and a large\nnumber of bounding box annotated data, we achieved competitive performance\nusing a teacher-student design. Models trained on larger amounts of semantic\nannotations did not perform better than those trained on teacher-annotated\ndata.

However, the requirements of phase-locking and\nphase-tracking techniques drastically increase the experimental complexity,\neconomic cost and prohibit free-space realization. Inspired by the duality in\nentanglement, we herein present an asynchronous measurement-device-independent\nquantum key distribution protocol that can surpass the repeaterless bound even\nwithout phase locking and phase tracking. Leveraging the concept of time\nmultiplexing, asynchronous two-photon Bell-state measurement is realized by\npostmatching two interference detection events. For a 1 GHz system, the new\nprotocol reaches a transmission distance of 450 km without phase tracking.\nAfter further removing phase locking, our protocol is still capable of breaking\nthe bound at 270 km by employing a 10 GHz system. Intriguingly, when using the\nsame experimental techniques, our protocol has a higher key rate than the\nphase-matching-type twin-field protocol. In the presence of imperfect intensity\nmodulation, it also has a significant advantage in terms of the transmission\ndistance over the sending-or-not-sending type twin-field protocol.

But what if no one is\nlooking? What keeps people cooperating then? Conscience, an internal enforcer\nof cooperation, could be the answer. In this paper, we model conscience as the\ninternalization of societal norms: individuals with conscience internalize a\ntendency to cooperate in a public goods game, as long as the majority of their\ncommunity does the same (regardless of whether anyone was watching). Using two\nvery different agent-based models, we sought to determine the evolutionary\nviability of this rudimentary conscience, as well as its impact on the\nevolution of cooperation. We found that, in both models, conscience was\nevolutionarily viable under reasonable group-selective forces. Furthermore,\nconscience affected the dynamics of cooperation in three ways. First,\nconscience polarized communities: groups with high prevalence of conscience\ngravitated either to near-full cooperation, or to near-zero cooperation.\nSecond, conscience catalyzed cooperation: its tendency to polarize magnified\ndifferences between groups, thereby facilitating the group-level selection in\nfavor of cooperative groups. Third, in one of our models, conscience stabilized\ncooperation: the prevalence of conscience tended to decrease when cooperation\nwas high and increase when cooperation was low, thereby dampening fluctuations\nin the level of cooperation.",

Metagenomics studies the genomic material of such communities\nthrough high-throughput sequencing that yields DNA subsequences for subsequent\nanalysis. A fundamental problem in the standard workflow, called binning, is to\ndiscover clusters, of genomic subsequences, associated with the unknown\nconstituent organisms. Inherent noise in the subsequences, various biological\nconstraints that need to be imposed on them and the skewed cluster size\ndistribution exacerbate the difficulty of this unsupervised learning problem.\nIn this paper, we present a new formulation using a graph where the nodes are\nsubsequences and edges represent homophily information.

We solve the binning problem by developing new\nalgorithms for (i) graph representation learning that preserves both homophily\nrelations and heterophily constraints (ii) constraint-based graph clustering\nmethod that addresses the problems of skewed cluster size distribution.\nExtensive experiments, on real and synthetic datasets, demonstrate that our\napproach, called RepBin, outperforms a wide variety of competing methods.

    "title": "On Asymptotic Linear Convergence of Projected Gradient Descent for  Constrained Least Squares",
    "abstract": "Many recent problems in signal processing and machine learning such as\ncompressed sensing, image restoration, matrix/tensor recovery, and non-negative\nmatrix factorization can be cast as constrained optimization. Projected\ngradient descent is a simple yet efficient method for solving such constrained\noptimization problems. Local convergence analysis furthers our understanding of\nits asymptotic behavior near the solution, offering sharper bounds on the\nconvergence rate compared to global convergence analysis. However, local\nguarantees often appear scattered in problem-specific areas of machine learning\nand signal processing. This manuscript presents a unified framework for the\nlocal convergence analysis of projected gradient descent in the context of\nconstrained least squares. The proposed analysis offers insights into pivotal\nlocal convergence properties such as the condition of linear convergence, the\nregion of convergence, the exact asymptotic rate of convergence, and the bound\non the number of iterations needed to reach a certain level of accuracy. To\ndemonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, we present a recipe for\nthe convergence analysis of PGD and demonstrate it via a beginning-to-end\napplication of the recipe on four fundamental problems, namely, linearly\nconstrained least squares, sparse recovery, least squares with the unit norm\nconstraint, and matrix completion.",

    "abstract": "Entropic Outlier Sparsification (EOS) is proposed as a robust computational\nstrategy for the detection of data anomalies in a broad class of learning\nmethods, including the unsupervised problems (like detection of non-Gaussian\noutliers in mostly-Gaussian data) and in the supervised learning with\nmislabeled data. EOS dwells on the derived analytic closed-form solution of the\n(weighted) expected error minimization problem subject to the Shannon entropy\nregularization. In contrast to common regularization strategies requiring\ncomputational costs that scale polynomial with the data dimension, identified\nclosed-form solution is proven to impose additional iteration costs that depend\nlinearly on statistics size and are independent of data dimension. Obtained\nanalytic results also explain why the mixtures of spherically-symmetric\nGaussians - used heuristically in many popular data analysis algorithms -\nrepresent an optimal choice for the non-parametric probability distributions\nwhen working with squared Euclidean distances, combining expected error\nminimality, maximal entropy/unbiasedness, and a linear cost scaling. The\nperformance of EOS is compared to a range of commonly-used tools on synthetic\nproblems and on partially-mislabeled supervised classification problems from\nbiomedicine.",

Quantum Walks (QWs) consist of single and\nisolated quantum systems, evolving in discrete or continuous time steps\naccording to a causal, shift-invariant unitary evolution in discrete space. We\nstart reminding some necessary fundamentals of linear algebra, including the\ndefinitions of Hilbert space, tensor state, the definition of linear operator\nand then we briefly present the principles of quantum mechanics on which this\nthesis is grounded. After having reviewed the literature of QWs and the main\nhistorical approaches to their study, we then move on to consider a new\nproperty of QWs, the plasticity. Plastic QWs are those ones admitting both\ncontinuous time-discrete space and continuous spacetime time limit. We show\nthat such QWs can be used to quantum simulate a large class of physical\nphenomena described by transport equations. We investigate this new family of\nQWs in one and two spatial dimensions, showing that in two dimensions, the PDEs\nwe can simulate are more general and include dispersive terms. We show that the\nabove results do not need to rely on the grid and we prove that such QW-based\nquantum simulators can be defined on 2-complex simplicia, i.e. triangular\nlattices. Finally, we extend the above result to any arbitrary triangulation,\nproving that such QWs coincide in the continuous limit to a transport equation\non a general curved surface, including the curved Dirac equation in 2+1\nspacetime dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Brain metastases occur frequently in patients with metastatic cancer. Early\nand accurate detection of brain metastases is very essential for treatment\nplanning and prognosis in radiation therapy. To improve brain metastasis\ndetection performance with deep learning, a custom detection loss called\nvolume-level sensitivity-specificity (VSS) is proposed, which rates individual\nmetastasis detection sensitivity and specificity in (sub-)volume levels. As\nsensitivity and precision are always a trade-off in a metastasis level, either\na high sensitivity or a high precision can be achieved by adjusting the weights\nin the VSS loss without decline in dice score coefficient for segmented\nmetastases. To reduce metastasis-like structures being detected as false\npositive metastases, a temporal prior volume is proposed as an additional input\nof the neural network. Our proposed VSS loss improves the sensitivity of brain\nmetastasis detection, increasing the sensitivity from 86.7% to 95.5%.\nAlternatively, it improves the precision from 68.8% to 97.8%. With the\nadditional temporal prior volume, about 45% of the false positive metastases\nare reduced in the high sensitivity model and the precision reaches 99.6% for\nthe high specificity model. The mean dice coefficient for all metastases is\nabout 0.81. With the ensemble of the high sensitivity and high specificity\nmodels, on average only 1.5 false positive metastases per patient needs further\ncheck, while the majority of true positive metastases are confirmed. The\nensemble learning is able to distinguish high confidence true positive\nmetastases from metastases candidates that require special expert review or\nfurther follow-up, being particularly well-fit to the requirements of expert\nsupport in real clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Multigraded Betti numbers are one of the simplest invariants of\nmultiparameter persistence modules.

However,\nto the best of our knowledge, no bottleneck stability result with respect to\nthe interleaving distance has been established for this invariant so far, and\nthis potential lack of stability limits its practical applications. We prove a\nstability result for multigraded Betti numbers, using an efficiently computable\nbottleneck-type dissimilarity function we introduce. Our notion of matching is\ninspired by recent work on signed barcodes, and allows matching of bars of the\nsame module in homological degrees of different parity, as well as for\nmatchings of bars of different modules in homological degrees of the same\nparity. Our stability result is a combination of Hilbert's syzygy theorem,\nBjerkevik's bottleneck stability for free modules, and a novel stability result\nfor projective resolutions.

    "abstract": "Since early 2020, the world has been dealing with a raging pandemic outbreak:\nCOVID-19. A year later, vaccines have become accessible, but in limited\nquantities, so that governments needed to devise a strategy to decide which\npart of the population to prioritize when assigning the available doses, and\nhow to manage the interval between doses for multi-dose vaccines. In this\npaper, we present an optimization framework to address the dynamic double-dose\nvaccine allocation problem whereby the available vaccine doses must be\nadministered to different age-groups to minimize specific societal objectives.\nIn particular, we first identify an age-dependent\nSusceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) epidemic model including an\nextension capturing partially and fully vaccinated people, whereby we account\nfor age-dependent immunity and infectiousness levels together with disease\nseverity. Second, we leverage our model to frame the dynamic age-dependent\nvaccine allocation problem for different societal objectives, such as the\nminimization of infections or fatalities, and solve it with nonlinear\nprogramming techniques. Finally, we carry out a numerical case study with\nreal-world data from The Netherlands. Our results show how different societal\nobjectives can significantly alter the optimal vaccine allocation strategy. For\ninstance, we find that minimizing the overall number of infections results in\ndelaying second doses, whilst to minimize fatalities it is important to fully\nvaccinate the elderly first.",

Supervised learning methods rely on labeled images which requires a\nconsiderable effort by medical experts to first understand the communities of\nimages present in the data and then labeling the images. Here, we propose an\nalgorithm to facilitate the automatic identification of communities in medical\nimage datasets. We further explain that such analysis can also be insightful in\na supervised setting, when the images are already labeled. Such insights are\nuseful because in reality, health and disease severity can be considered a\ncontinuous spectrum, and within each class, there usually are finer communities\nworthy of investigation, especially when they have similarities to communities\nin other classes.

    "title": "Application of Opinion Dynamics Models in Energy Eco-Feedback  Agent-Based Simulation",
    "abstract": "Research suggests that curbing consumer demand for energy through behavioural\ninterventions is an essential component of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions and climate change. On this ground, feedback interventions, which\nmake the energy consumption and conservation efforts visible to the consumers,\nare considered as a practical method increasing the energy saving behaviours.\nSimulation techniques provide a convenient and economical tool to examine the\nfactors that could affect the energy saving amount as the outcome of such\ninterventions. However, developing a reasonable model that could correctly\nrepresent real-world process is a big challenge. In this paper, five common\nOpinion Dynamic (OD) models that represent how opinion change occur among\nindividuals interactions have been investigated and a Revised OD (ROD) model\nhave been proposed to build more efficient eco-feedback simulation models.\nFindings indicate that influence condition and weight-factor of connected\nopinions have significant impact on the accuracy of simulation outputs, which\nhave been compared to the field experiment reports. Accordingly, ROD has been\nsuggested for eco-feedback simulations, which shows the closest prediction to\nthe field data.",

    "title": "Activity-based and agent-based Transport model of Melbourne (AToM): an  open multi-modal transport simulation model for Greater Melbourne",
    "abstract": "Agent-based and activity-based models for simulating transportation systems\nhave attracted significant attention in recent years. Few studies, however,\ninclude a detailed representation of active modes of transportation - such as\nwalking and cycling - at a city-wide level, where dominating motorised modes\nare often of primary concern. This paper presents an open workflow for creating\na multi-modal agent-based and activity-based transport simulation model,\nfocusing on Greater Melbourne, and including the process of mode choice\ncalibration for the four main travel modes of driving, public transport,\ncycling and walking. The synthetic population generated and used as an input\nfor the simulation model represented Melbourne's population based on Census\n2016, with daily activities and trips based on the Victoria's 2016-18 travel\nsurvey data. The road network used in the simulation model includes all public\nroads accessible via the included travel modes. We compared the output of the\nsimulation model with observations from the real world in terms of mode share,\nroad volume, travel time, and travel distance. Through these comparisons, we\nshowed that our model is suitable for studying mode choice and road usage\nbehaviour of travellers.",

    "title": "Predicting treatment effects from observational studies using machine  learning methods: A simulation study",
    "abstract": "Measuring treatment effects in observational studies is challenging because\nof confounding bias. Confounding occurs when a variable affects both the\ntreatment and the outcome. Traditional methods such as propensity score\nmatching estimate treatment effects by conditioning on the confounders. Recent\nliterature has presented new methods that use machine learning to predict the\ncounterfactuals in observational studies which then allow for estimating\ntreatment effects. These studies however, have been applied to real world data\nwhere the true treatment effects have not been known. This study aimed to study\nthe effectiveness of this counterfactual prediction method by simulating two\nmain scenarios: with and without confounding. Each type also included linear\nand non-linear relationships between input and output data. The key item in the\nsimulations was that we generated known true causal effects. Linear regression,\nlasso regression and random forest models were used to predict the\ncounterfactuals and treatment effects. These were compared these with the true\ntreatment effect as well as a naive treatment effect. The results show that the\nmost important factor in whether this machine learning method performs well, is\nthe degree of non-linearity in the data. Surprisingly, for both non-confounding\n\\textit{and} confounding, the machine learning models all performed well on the\nlinear dataset. However, when non-linearity was introduced, the models\nperformed very poorly. Therefore under the conditions of this simulation study,\nthe machine learning method performs well under conditions of linearity, even\nif confounding is present, but at this stage should not be trusted when\nnon-linearity is introduced.",

The general formulation of exchange forces in terms\nof two potential energies allows for the implementation of accurate machine\nlearning models for adiabatic spin dynamics of out-of-equilibrium itinerant\nmagnetic systems. To demonstrate our approach, we develop a deep-learning\nneural network that successfully learns the forces in a driven s-d model\ncomputed from the nonequilibrium Green's function method. We show that the\nLandau-Lifshitz dynamics simulations with forces predicted from the neural-net\nmodel accurately reproduce the voltage-driven domain-wall propagation.
