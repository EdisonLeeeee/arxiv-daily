    "abstract": "Human developers can produce code with cybersecurity weaknesses. Can emerging\n'smart' code completion tools help repair those weaknesses? In this work, we\nexamine the use of large language models (LLMs) for code (such as OpenAI's\nCodex and AI21's Jurassic J-1) for zero-shot vulnerability repair. We\ninvestigate challenges in the design of prompts that coax LLMs into generating\nrepaired versions of insecure code. This is difficult due to the numerous ways\nto phrase key information -- both semantically and syntactically -- with\nnatural languages. By performing a large scale study of four commercially\navailable, black-box, \"off-the-shelf\" LLMs, as well as a locally-trained model,\non a mix of synthetic, hand-crafted, and real-world security bug scenarios, our\nexperiments show that LLMs could collectively repair 100% of our synthetically\ngenerated and hand-crafted scenarios, as well as 58% of vulnerabilities in a\nselection of historical bugs in real-world open-source projects.",

    "abstract": "High resolution analog to digital converters (ADCs) are conventionally used\nat the receiver terminals to store an accurate digital representation of the\nreceived signal, thereby allowing for reliable decoding of transmitted\nmessages. However, in a wide range of applications, such as communication over\nmillimeter wave and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the\nuse of high resolution ADCs is not feasible due to power budget limitations. In\nthe conventional fully digital receiver design, where each receiver antenna is\nconnected to a distinct ADC, reducing the ADC resolution leads to performance\nloss in terms of achievable rates. One proposed method to mitigate the\nrate-loss is to use analog linear combiners leading to design of hybrid\nreceivers. Here, the hybrid framework is augmented by the addition of delay\nelements to allow for temporal analog processing. Two new classes of receivers\nconsisting of delay elements, analog linear combiners, and one-bit ADCs are\nproposed. The fundamental limits of communication in single and multi-user\n(uplink and downlink) MIMO systems employing the proposed receivers are\ninvestigated. In the high signal to noise ratio regime, it is shown that the\nproposed receivers achieve the maximum achievable rates among all receivers\nwith the same number of one-bit ADCs.",

    "abstract": "This work examines adaptive distributed learning strategies designed to\noperate under communication constraints. We consider a network of agents that\nmust solve an online optimization problem from continual observation of\nstreaming data. The agents implement a distributed cooperative strategy where\neach agent is allowed to perform local exchange of information with its\nneighbors. In order to cope with communication constraints, the exchanged\ninformation must be unavoidably compressed. We propose a diffusion strategy\nnicknamed as ACTC (Adapt-Compress-Then-Combine), which relies on the following\nsteps: i) an adaptation step where each agent performs an individual\nstochastic-gradient update with constant step-size; ii) a compression step that\nleverages a recently introduced class of stochastic compression operators; and\niii) a combination step where each agent combines the compressed updates\nreceived from its neighbors. The distinguishing elements of this work are as\nfollows. First, we focus on adaptive strategies, where constant (as opposed to\ndiminishing) step-sizes are critical to respond in real time to nonstationary\nvariations. Second, we consider the general class of directed graphs and\nleft-stochastic combination policies, which allow us to enhance the interplay\nbetween topology and learning. Third, in contrast with related works that\nassume strong convexity for all individual agents' cost functions, we require\nstrong convexity only at a network level, a condition satisfied even if a\nsingle agent has a strongly-convex cost and the remaining agents have\nnon-convex costs. Fourth, we focus on a diffusion (as opposed to consensus)\nstrategy. Under the demanding setting of compressed information, we establish\nthat the ACTC iterates fluctuate around the desired optimizer, achieving\nremarkable savings in terms of bits exchanged between neighboring agents.",

An accurate energy\nforecasting at the customer level will reflect directly into efficiency\nimprovements across the power grid system, however forecasting building energy\nuse is a complex task due to many influencing factors, such as meteorological\nand occupancy patterns. In addiction, high-dimensional time series increasingly\narise in the Internet of Energy (IoE), given the emergence of multi-sensor\nenvironments and the two way communication between energy consumers and the\nsmart grid. Therefore, methods that are capable of computing high-dimensional\ntime series are of great value in smart building and IoE applications.

Unfortunately, the existing FTS models can be\nunfeasible if all features were used to train the model. We present a new\nmethodology for handling high-dimensional time series, by projecting the\noriginal high-dimensional data into a low dimensional embedding space and using\nmultivariate FTS approach in this low dimensional representation.

    "abstract": "Modern herbicide application in agricultural settings typically relies on\neither large scale sprayers that dispense herbicide over crops and weeds alike\nor portable sprayers that require labor intensive manual operation. The former\nmethod results in overuse of herbicide and reduction in crop yield while the\nlatter is often untenable in large scale operations. This paper presents the\nfirst fully autonomous robot for weed management for row crops capable of\ncomputer vision based navigation, weed detection, complete field coverage, and\nautomatic recharge for under \\$400. The target application is autonomous\ninter-row weed control in crop fields, e.g. flax and canola, where the spacing\nbetween croplines is as small as one foot. The proposed robot is small enough\nto pass between croplines at all stages of plant growth while detecting weeds\nand spraying herbicide. A recharging system incorporates newly designed robotic\nhardware, a ramp, a robotic charging arm, and a mobile charging station. An\nintegrated vision algorithm is employed to assist with charger alignment\neffectively. Combined, they enable the robot to work continuously in the field\nwithout access to electricity. In addition, a color-based contour algorithm\ncombined with preprocessing techniques is applied for robust navigation relying\non the input from the onboard monocular camera. Incorporating such compact\nrobots into farms could help automate weed control, even during late stages of\ngrowth, and reduce herbicide use by targeting weeds with precision.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of contextual bandits where actions are subsets of a\nground set and mean rewards are modeled by an unknown monotone submodular\nfunction that belongs to a class $\\mathcal{F}$. We allow time-varying matroid\nconstraints to be placed on the feasible sets. Assuming access to an online\nregression oracle with regret $\\mathsf{Reg}(\\mathcal{F})$, our algorithm\nefficiently randomizes around local optima of estimated functions according to\nthe Inverse Gap Weighting strategy. We show that cumulative regret of this\nprocedure with time horizon $n$ scales as $O(\\sqrt{n\n\\mathsf{Reg}(\\mathcal{F})})$ against a benchmark with a multiplicative factor\n$1/2$. On the other hand, using the techniques of (Filmus and Ward 2014), we\nshow that an $\\epsilon$-Greedy procedure with local randomization attains\nregret of $O(n^{2/3} \\mathsf{Reg}(\\mathcal{F})^{1/3})$ against a stronger\n$(1-e^{-1})$ benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Unfairness in mortgage lending has created generational inequality among\nracial and ethnic groups in the US. Many studies address this problem, but most\nexisting work focuses on correlation-based techniques. In our work, we use the\nframework of counterfactual fairness to train fair machine learning models. We\npropose a new causal graph for the variables available in the Home Mortgage\nDisclosure Act (HMDA) data. We use a matching-based approach instead of the\nlatent variable modeling approach, because the former approach does not rely on\nany modeling assumptions. Furthermore, matching provides us with counterfactual\npairs in which the race variable is isolated. We first demonstrate the\nunfairness in mortgage approval and interest rates between African-American and\nnon-Hispanic White sub-populations. Then, we show that having balanced data\nusing matching does not guarantee perfect counterfactual fairness of the\nmachine learning models.",

    "abstract": "We study a class of classification problems best exemplified by the\n\\emph{bank loan} problem, where a lender decides whether or not to issue a\nloan. The lender only observes whether a customer will repay a loan if the loan\nis issued to begin with, and thus modeled decisions affect what data is\navailable to the lender for future decisions. As a result, it is possible for\nthe lender's algorithm to ``get stuck'' with a self-fulfilling model. This\nmodel never corrects its false negatives, since it never sees the true label\nfor rejected data, thus accumulating infinite regret. In the case of linear\nmodels, this issue can be addressed by adding optimism directly into the model\npredictions. However, there are few methods that extend to the function\napproximation case using Deep Neural Networks. We present Pseudo-Label Optimism\n(PLOT), a conceptually and computationally simple method for this setting\napplicable to DNNs. \\PLOT{} adds an optimistic label to the subset of decision\npoints the current model is deciding on, trains the model on all data so far\n(including these points along with their optimistic labels), and finally uses\nthe resulting \\emph{optimistic} model for decision making. \\PLOT{} achieves\ncompetitive performance on a set of three challenging benchmark problems,\nrequiring minimal hyperparameter tuning. We also show that \\PLOT{} satisfies a\nlogarithmic regret guarantee, under a Lipschitz and logistic mean label model,\nand under a separability condition on the data.",

On\nembedded systems with standard CMOS chips, where secure permanent memory such\nas flash is not available as a key storage, the secret key can be derived from\nPhysical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) that make use of minuscule manufacturing\nvariations of, for instance, SRAM cells.

    "abstract": "Deep learning and hardware for it has garnered immense academic and industry\ninterest in the past 5 years -- including almost 100 startups, more than $5B of\nVC investment -- and a re-relevance of the role of architecture. However, the\nstate-of-art remains NVIDIA's TensorCore-based systems that provide i)\ntop-of-line performance, ii) turnkey software stack, and iii) coverage across a\nwide-spectrum of DL network styles (DL-architecture in AI parlance). Other\nacademic and industry efforts have included novel approaches like spatial\ndataflow, CGRAs, systolic arrays, blended FPGA LUTs with fixed function units\nand more. These have all necessitated their own innovations in architecture,\ncompiler, and software stack integration. However, none of these have yet\nsatisfied all the 3 metrics that NVIDIA's TensorCore and software stack\nprovides, and generally seem to perform worse. In this paper, we systematically\ninvestigate the behavior of DL workloads and imputed needs on\nhardware/compiler/software. We show that SIMD/short-vector, caching, and\nsynchronization in a fairly well-understood multicore chip organization we call\nUPCYCLE can achieve day-zero software maturity, and provide big integer factor\nspeedups over the state-of-art NVIDIA solutions. Compared to an A100, UPCYCLE\nat small-batch size is geo-mean 3.8X faster for inference, geo-mean 4.2X faster\nat training, while consuming only half the power. Second, the UPCYCLE\narchitecture requires no new compiler or software stack innovation. Third, it\nprovides full DL-architecture coverage, and can be instantiated to provide\ntraining-optimized, inference-optimized, or balanced training and inference\nsystems. Overall, this paper motivates the treatment of software maturity as a\nfirst class design constraint in developing new architectures for DL.

    "abstract": "Advances in LiDAR sensors provide rich 3D data that supports 3D scene\nunderstanding. However, due to occlusion and signal miss, LiDAR point clouds\nare in practice 2.5D as they cover only partial underlying shapes, which poses\na fundamental challenge to 3D perception. To tackle the challenge, we present a\nnovel LiDAR-based 3D object detection model, dubbed Behind the Curtain Detector\n(BtcDet), which learns the object shape priors and estimates the complete\nobject shapes that are partially occluded (curtained) in point clouds. BtcDet\nfirst identifies the regions that are affected by occlusion and signal miss. In\nthese regions, our model predicts the probability of occupancy that indicates\nif a region contains object shapes. Integrated with this probability map,\nBtcDet can generate high-quality 3D proposals. Finally, the probability of\noccupancy is also integrated into a proposal refinement module to generate the\nfinal bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on the KITTI Dataset and the Waymo\nOpen Dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of BtcDet. Particularly, for the 3D\ndetection of both cars and cyclists on the KITTI benchmark, BtcDet surpasses\nall of the published state-of-the-art methods by remarkable margins.

In this work, we present a joint\naudio-text model to capture the contextual information for expressive\nspeech-driven 3D facial animation. The existing datasets are collected to cover\nas many different phonemes as possible instead of sentences, thus limiting the\ncapability of the audio-based model to learn more diverse contexts. To address\nthis, we propose to leverage the contextual text embeddings extracted from the\npowerful pre-trained language model that has learned rich contextual\nrepresentations from large-scale text data. Our hypothesis is that the text\nfeatures can disambiguate the variations in upper face expressions, which are\nnot strongly correlated with the audio. In contrast to prior approaches which\nlearn phoneme-level features from the text, we investigate the high-level\ncontextual text features for speech-driven 3D facial animation. We show that\nthe combined acoustic and textual modalities can synthesize realistic facial\nexpressions while maintaining audio-lip synchronization.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has lead to considerable break-throughs in diverse\nareas such as robotics, games and many others. But the application to RL in\ncomplex real-world decision making problems remains limited. Many problems in\noperations management (inventory and revenue management, for example) are\ncharacterized by large action spaces and stochastic system dynamics. These\ncharacteristics make the problem considerably harder to solve for existing RL\nmethods that rely on enumeration techniques to solve per step action problems.\nTo resolve these issues, we develop Programmable Actor Reinforcement Learning\n(PARL), a policy iteration method that uses techniques from integer programming\nand sample average approximation. Analytically, we show that the for a given\ncritic, the learned policy in each iteration converges to the optimal policy as\nthe underlying samples of the uncertainty go to infinity. Practically, we show\nthat a properly selected discretization of the underlying uncertain\ndistribution can yield near optimal actor policy even with very few samples\nfrom the underlying uncertainty. We then apply our algorithm to real-world\ninventory management problems with complex supply chain structures and show\nthat PARL outperforms state-of-the-art RL and inventory optimization methods in\nthese settings. We find that PARL outperforms commonly used base stock\nheuristic by 44.7% and the best performing RL method by up to 12.1% on average\nacross different supply chain environments.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a parallel overlapping domain decomposition preconditioner is\nproposed to solve the linear system of equations arising from the extended\nfinite element discretization of elastic crack problems. The algorithm\npartitions the computational mesh into two types of subdomains: the regular\nsubdomains and the crack tip subdomains based on the observation that the crack\ntips have a significant impact on the convergence of the iterative method while\nthe impact of the crack lines is not that different from those of regular mesh\npoints. The tip subdomains consist of mesh points at crack tips and all\nneighboring points where the branch enrichment functions are applied. The\nregular subdomains consist of all other mesh points, including those on the\ncrack lines. To overcome the mismatch between the number of subdomains and the\nnumber of processor cores, the proposed method is divided into two steps: solve\nthe crack tip problem and then the regular subdomain problem during each\niteration. The proposed method was used to develop a parallel XFEM package\nwhich is able to test different types of iterative methods. To achieve good\nparallel efficiency, additional methods were introduced to reduce communication\nand to maintain the load balance between processors. Numerical experiments\nindicate that the proposed method significantly reduces the number of\niterations and the total computation time compared to the classical methods. In\naddition, the method scales up to 8192 processor cores with over 70\\% parallel\nefficiency to solve problems with more than $2\\times10^8$ degrees of freedom.",

Although many existing approaches perform regularization to\nalleviate quantization errors, we figure out an incompatible conflict between\nthe metric and quantization losses. The metric loss penalizes the inter-class\ndistances to push different classes unconstrained far away.

    "abstract": "Phishing attacks continue to be a significant threat on the Internet. Prior\nstudies show that it is possible to determine whether a website is phishing or\nnot just by analyzing its URL more carefully. A major advantage of the URL\nbased approach is that it can identify a phishing website even before the web\npage is rendered in the browser, thus avoiding other potential problems such as\ncryptojacking and drive-by downloads. However, traditional URL based approaches\nhave their limitations. Blacklist based approaches are prone to zero-hour\nphishing attacks, advanced machine learning based approaches consume high\nresources, and other approaches send the URL to a remote server which\ncompromises user's privacy. In this paper, we present a layered anti-phishing\ndefense, PhishMatch, which is robust, accurate, inexpensive, and client-side.\nWe design a space-time efficient Aho-Corasick algorithm for exact string\nmatching and n-gram based indexing technique for approximate string matching to\ndetect various cybersquatting techniques in the phishing URL. To reduce false\npositives, we use a global whitelist and personalized user whitelists. We also\ndetermine the context in which the URL is visited and use that information to\nclassify the input URL more accurately. The last component of PhishMatch\ninvolves a machine learning model and controlled search engine queries to\nclassify the URL.

Such blockchain platforms heavily depend on cryptography to\nprovide a layer of trust within the network, thus verification of cryptographic\nsignatures often becomes the bottleneck. The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature\nAlgorithm (ECDSA) is the most commonly used cryptographic scheme in\npermissioned blockchains. In this paper, we propose an efficient implementation\nof ECDSA signature verification on an FPGA, in order to improve the performance\nof permissioned blockchains that aim to use FPGA-based hardware accelerators.\nWe propose several optimizations for modular arithmetic (e.g., custom\nmultipliers and fast modular reduction) and point arithmetic (e.g., reduced\nnumber of point double and addition operations, and optimal width NAF\nrepresentation). Based on these optimized modular and point arithmetic modules,\nwe propose an ECDSA verification engine that can be used by any application for\nfast verification of ECDSA signatures. We further optimize our ECDSA\nverification engine for Hyperledger Fabric (one of the most widely used\npermissioned blockchain platforms) by moving carefully selected operations to a\nprecomputation block, thus simplifying the critical path of ECDSA signature\nverification. From our implementation on Xilinx Alveo U250 accelerator board\nwith target frequency of 250MHz, our ECDSA verification engine can perform a\nsingle verification in $760\\mu s$ resulting in a throughput of 1,315\nverifications per second, which is ~2.5x faster than state-of-the-art\nFPGA-based implementations.

None of the prior work on\nmembership privacy risk metrics simultaneously meets all of these criteria.\nWe propose such a metric, SHAPr, which uses Shapley values to quantify a\nmodel's memorization of an individual training data record by measuring its\ninfluence on the model's utility. This memorization is a measure of the\nlikelihood of a successful MIA.\nUsing ten benchmark datasets, we show that SHAPr is effective (precision:\n0.94$\\pm 0.06$, recall: 0.88$\\pm 0.06$) in estimating susceptibility of a\ntraining data record for MIAs, and is efficient (computable within minutes for\nsmaller datasets and in ~90 minutes for the largest dataset).\nSHAPr is also versatile in that it can be used for other purposes like\nassessing fairness or assigning valuation for subsets of a dataset.

Then, inspired by our study, we propose the first automated approach,\nnamed TRACER, to find patches for an OSS vulnerability from multiple sources.\nOur key idea is that patch commits will be frequently referenced during the\nreporting, discussion and resolution of an OSS vulnerability. Our extensive\nevaluation has indicated that i) TRACER finds patches for up to 273.8% more\nCVEs than existing heuristic-based approaches while achieving a significantly\nhigher F1-score by up to 116.8%; and ii) TRACER achieves a higher recall by up\nto 18.4% than state-of-the-art vulnerability databases, but sacrifices up to\n12.0% fewer CVEs (whose patches are not found) and 6.4% lower precision. Our\nevaluation has also demonstrated the generality and usefulness of TRACER.",

One of the key challenges behind this task is leveraging the referring\nexpression for highlighting relevant positions in the image. A paradigm for\ntackling this problem is to leverage a powerful vision-language (\"cross-modal\")\ndecoder to fuse features independently extracted from a vision encoder and a\nlanguage encoder. Recent methods have made remarkable advancements in this\nparadigm by exploiting Transformers as cross-modal decoders, concurrent to the\nTransformer's overwhelming success in many other vision-language tasks.\nAdopting a different approach in this work, we show that significantly better\ncross-modal alignments can be achieved through the early fusion of linguistic\nand visual features in intermediate layers of a vision Transformer encoder\nnetwork. By conducting cross-modal feature fusion in the visual feature\nencoding stage, we can leverage the well-proven correlation modeling power of a\nTransformer encoder for excavating helpful multi-modal context. This way,\naccurate segmentation results are readily harvested with a light-weight mask\npredictor.

Despite the fruitful progress, existing methods for both problems are\nstill brittle to the same challenge -- it remains dilemmatic to integrate the\ncommon information across modalities (resp. tasks) meanwhile preserving the\nspecific patterns of each modality (resp. task). Besides, while they are\nactually closely related to each other, multimodal fusion and multitask\nlearning are rarely explored within the same methodological framework before.\nIn this paper, we propose Channel-Exchanging-Network (CEN) which is\nself-adaptive, parameter-free, and more importantly, applicable for both\nmultimodal fusion and multitask learning. At its core, CEN dynamically\nexchanges channels between subnetworks of different modalities. Specifically,\nthe channel exchanging process is self-guided by individual channel importance\nthat is measured by the magnitude of Batch-Normalization (BN) scaling factor\nduring training. For the application of dense image prediction, the validity of\nCEN is tested by four different scenarios: multimodal fusion, cycle multimodal\nfusion, multitask learning, and multimodal multitask learning. Extensive\nexperiments on semantic segmentation via RGB-D data and image translation\nthrough multi-domain input verify the effectiveness of our CEN compared to\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods.

Previous works combined graph\nconvolution networks (GCNs) and self-attention mechanism with deep time series\nmodels (e.g. recurrent neural networks) to capture the spatio-temporal\ncorrelations separately, ignoring the relationships across time and space.\nBesides, GCNs are limited by over-smoothing issue and self-attention is limited\nby quadratic problem, result in GCNs lack global representation capabilities,\nand self-attention inefficiently capture the global spatial dependence. In this\npaper, we propose a novel deep learning model for traffic forecasting, named\nMulti-Context Aware Spatio-Temporal Joint Linear Attention (STJLA), which\napplies linear attention to the spatio-temporal joint graph to capture global\ndependence between all spatio-temporal nodes efficiently. More specifically,\nSTJLA utilizes static structural context and dynamic semantic context to\nimprove model performance. The static structure context based on node2vec and\none-hot encoding enriches the spatio-temporal position information.\nFurthermore, the multi-head diffusion convolution network based dynamic spatial\ncontext enhances the local spatial perception ability, and the GRU based\ndynamic temporal context stabilizes sequence position information of the linear\nattention, respectively.

However, compared to costly training a large-scale model from\nscratch, how to effectively adapt pre-trained models to a new task has not been\nfully explored. In this paper, we propose an approach to bridge pre-trained\nmodels and code-related tasks. We exploit semantic-preserving transformation to\nenrich downstream data diversity, and help pre-trained models learn semantic\nfeatures invariant to these semantically equivalent transformations. Further,\nwe introduce curriculum learning to organize the transformed data in an\neasy-to-hard manner to fine-tune existing pre-trained models.\nWe apply our approach to a range of pre-trained models, and they\nsignificantly outperform the state-of-the-art models on tasks for source code\nunderstanding, such as algorithm classification, code clone detection, and code\nsearch. Our experiments even show that without heavy pre-training on code data,\nnatural language pre-trained model RoBERTa fine-tuned with our lightweight\napproach could outperform or rival existing code pre-trained models fine-tuned\non the above tasks, such as CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT. This finding suggests\nthat there is still much room for improvement in code pre-trained models.",

    "abstract": "Revision game is a very new model formulating the situation where players can\nprepare and revise their actions in advance before a deadline when payoffs are\nrealized. We identify the Limited Retaliation (LR) strategy for revision games\nwhich sustains a high level of mutual cooperation and is robust to players'\noccasional mistakes. The LR strategy stipulates that, (1) players first follow\na recommended cooperative plan; (2) if anyone deviates from the plan, the LR\nplayer retaliates by using the defection action for a limited duration; (3)\nafter the retaliation, the LR player returns to the cooperative plan. The LR\nstrategy has two good features. First, it is vengeful, in the sense that it\ndeters the opponent from non-cooperative action by threatening a retaliation.\nSecond, it is forgiving, because it returns to cooperation after a proper\nretaliation. The vengeful feature makes it constitute a subgame perfect\nequilibrium, while the forgiving feature makes it tolerate occasional mistakes.\nThese are in clear contrast to the existing strategies for revision games which\nall assume players are extremely grim and never forgive. Besides its\ncontribution as a new robust and welfare-optimizing equilibrium strategy, our\nresults about LR strategy can also be used to explain how easy cooperation can\nhappen, and why forgiveness emerges in real-world multi-agent interactions.",

The\nrecent self-supervised learning (SSL) on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) model,\nPT-GNN, pre-trains the GNN model to reconstruct the cold-start embeddings and\nhas shown great potential for cold-start recommendation. However, due to the\nover-smoothing problem, PT-GNN can only capture up to 3-order relation, which\ncan not provide much useful auxiliary information to depict the target\ncold-start user or item.

Specifically, in terms of the model architecture, in addition to\nthe short-range dependencies of users and items captured by the GNN encoder, we\nintroduce a Transformer encoder to capture long-range dependencies.

Therefore, this work proposes an effective\nand efficient cross-modality fusion module called Bi-directional Adaptive\nAttention Gate (BAA-Gate).

Moreover, an adaptive interaction of\nBAA-Gate is introduced by the illumination-based weighting strategy to\nadaptively adjust the recalibrating and aggregating strength in the BAA-Gate\nand enhance the robustness towards illumination changes.

The crux lies in the limited depth of\napplying Transformer in the typical encoder-decoder framework for image\nrestoration, resulting from heavy self-attention computation load and\ninefficient communications across different depth (scales) of layers. In this\npaper, we present a deep and effective Transformer-based network for image\nrestoration, termed as U2-Former, which is able to employ Transformer as the\ncore operation to perform image restoration in a deep encoding and decoding\nspace. Specifically, it leverages the nested U-shaped structure to facilitate\nthe interactions across different layers with different scales of feature maps.\nFurthermore, we optimize the computational efficiency for the basic Transformer\nblock by introducing a feature-filtering mechanism to compress the token\nrepresentation. Apart from the typical supervision ways for image restoration,\nour U2-Former also performs contrastive learning in multiple aspects to further\ndecouple the noise component from the background image.

This paper proposes a novel framework of adaptive label\nthresholding algorithms for online multi-label classification, with the aim to\novercome the drawbacks of existing methods. The key feature of our framework is\nthat both scoring and thresholding models are included as important components\nof the online multi-label classifier and are incorporated into one online\noptimization problem. Further, in order to establish the relationship between\nscoring and thresholding models, a novel multi-label classification loss\nfunction is derived, which measures to what an extent the multi-label\nclassifier can distinguish between relevant labels and irrelevant ones for an\nincoming instance. Based on this new framework and loss function, we present a\nfirst-order linear algorithm and a second-order one, which both enjoy closed\nform update, but rely on different techniques for updating the multi-label\nclassifier. Both algorithms are proved to achieve a sub-linear regret. Using\nMercer kernels, our first-order algorithm has been extended to deal with\nnonlinear multi-label prediction tasks. Experiments show the advantage of our\nlinear and nonlinear algorithms, in terms of various multi-label performance\nmetrics.",

To obtain more robustness, we propose a structure distillation\napproach to learn knacks from a pretrained depth estimator that produces\nstructured but metric-agnostic depth due to its in-the-wild mixed-dataset\ntraining. By combining distillation with the self-supervised branch that learns\nmetrics from left-right consistency, we attain structured and metric depth for\ngeneric indoor scenes and make inferences in real-time. To facilitate learning\nand evaluation, we collect SimSIN, a dataset from simulation with thousands of\nenvironments, and UniSIN, a dataset that contains about 500 real scan sequences\nof generic indoor environments. We experiment in both sim-to-real and\nreal-to-real settings, and show improvements both qualitatively and\nquantitatively, as well as in downstream applications using our depth maps.\nThis work provides a full study, covering methods, data, and applications.

Also, continuous face\nmorphing can be easily achieved by interpolating the input shape, expression\nand appearance codes.

Our model shows strong ability on multiple applications\nincluding image-based fitting, random generation, face rigging, face editing,\nand novel view synthesis. Experiments show that our method achieves higher\nrepresentation ability than previous parametric models, and achieves\ncompetitive performance in several applications.

The base stations (BSs)\nand the users are assumed to be suffering from the limited dynamic range (LDR)\nnoise. Firstly, we present a centralized HYBF (C-HYBF) scheme based on\nalternating optimization. In general, the complexity of C-HYBF schemes scales\nquadratically as a function of the number of users, which is very undesirable.\nMoreover, tremendous computational power is required to optimize numerous\nvariables jointly in FD. Another major drawback is that huge communication\noverhead is also required to transfer complete channel state information (CSI)\nto the central node every channel coherence time. To overcome these drawbacks,\nwe present a very low-complexity and highly scalable cooperative per-link\nparallel and distributed (P$\\&$D)-HYBF scheme. It allows each FD BS to update\nthe beamformers for its users independently in parallel on different\ncomputational processors. Its complexity scales only linearly as the network\nsize grows, making it desirable for the next generation of large and dense\nmmWave FD networks.

Recent deep learning-based MVS\nmethods typically densely sample depth hypotheses in the depth range, and then\nconstruct prohibitively memory-consuming 3D cost volumes for depth prediction.\nAlthough coarse-to-fine sampling strategies alleviate this overhead issue to a\ncertain extent, the efficiency of MVS is still an open challenge. In this work,\nwe propose a novel method for highly efficient MVS that remarkably decreases\nthe memory footprint, meanwhile clearly advancing state-of-the-art depth\nprediction performance. We investigate what a search strategy can be reasonably\noptimal for MVS taking into account of both efficiency and effectiveness. We\nfirst formulate MVS as a binary search problem, and accordingly propose a\ngeneralized binary search network for MVS. Specifically, in each step, the\ndepth range is split into 2 bins with extra 1 error tolerance bin on both\nsides. A classification is performed to identify which bin contains the true\ndepth. We also design three mechanisms to respectively handle classification\nerrors, deal with out-of-range samples and decrease the training memory. The\nnew formulation makes our method only sample a very small number of depth\nhypotheses in each step, which is highly memory efficient, and also greatly\nfacilitates quick training convergence. Experiments on competitive benchmarks\nshow that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with much less memory.\nParticularly, our method obtains an overall score of 0.289 on DTU dataset and\ntops the first place on challenging Tanks and Temples advanced dataset among\nall the learning-based methods.

    "abstract": "Learning from a sequence of tasks for a lifetime is essential for an agent\ntowards artificial general intelligence. This requires the agent to\ncontinuously learn and memorize new knowledge without interference. This paper\nfirst demonstrates a fundamental issue of lifelong learning using neural\nnetworks, named anterograde forgetting, i.e., preserving and transferring\nmemory may inhibit the learning of new knowledge. This is attributed to the\nfact that the learning capacity of a neural network will be reduced as it keeps\nmemorizing historical knowledge, and the fact that conceptual confusion may\noccur as it transfers irrelevant old knowledge to the current task. This work\nproposes a general framework named Cycled Memory Networks (CMN) to address the\nanterograde forgetting in neural networks for lifelong learning. The CMN\nconsists of two individual memory networks to store short-term and long-term\nmemories to avoid capacity shrinkage. A transfer cell is designed to connect\nthese two memory networks, enabling knowledge transfer from the long-term\nmemory network to the short-term memory network to mitigate the conceptual\nconfusion, and a memory consolidation mechanism is developed to integrate\nshort-term knowledge into the long-term memory network for knowledge\naccumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the CMN can effectively\naddress the anterograde forgetting on several task-related, task-conflict,\nclass-incremental and cross-domain benchmarks.",

    "title": "Logic Shrinkage: Learned FPGA Netlist Sparsity for Efficient Neural  Network Inference",
    "abstract": "FPGA-specific DNN architectures using the native LUTs as independently\ntrainable inference operators have been shown to achieve favorable\narea-accuracy and energy-accuracy tradeoffs. The first work in this area,\nLUTNet, exhibited state-of-the-art performance for standard DNN benchmarks. In\nthis paper, we propose the learned optimization of such LUT-based topologies,\nresulting in higher-efficiency designs than via the direct use of\noff-the-shelf, hand-designed networks. Existing implementations of this class\nof architecture require the manual specification of the number of inputs per\nLUT, K. Choosing appropriate K a priori is challenging, and doing so at even\nhigh granularity, e.g. per layer, is a time-consuming and error-prone process\nthat leaves FPGAs' spatial flexibility underexploited. Furthermore, prior works\nsee LUT inputs connected randomly, which does not guarantee a good choice of\nnetwork topology. To address these issues, we propose logic shrinkage, a\nfine-grained netlist pruning methodology enabling K to be automatically learned\nfor every LUT in a neural network targeted for FPGA inference. By removing LUT\ninputs determined to be of low importance, our method increases the efficiency\nof the resultant accelerators. Our GPU-friendly solution to LUT input removal\nis capable of processing large topologies during their training with negligible\nslowdown. With logic shrinkage, we better the area and energy efficiency of the\nbest-performing LUTNet implementation of the CNV network classifying CIFAR-10\nby 1.54x and 1.31x, respectively, while matching its accuracy. This\nimplementation also reaches 2.71x the area efficiency of an equally accurate,\nheavily pruned BNN. On ImageNet with the Bi-Real Net architecture, employment\nof logic shrinkage results in a post-synthesis area reduction of 2.67x vs\nLUTNet, allowing for implementation that was previously impossible on today's\nlargest FPGAs.",

    "abstract": "Computing persistence over changing filtrations give rise to a stack of 2D\npersistence diagrams where the birth-death points are connected by the\nso-called 'vines'. We consider computing these vines over changing filtrations\nfor zigzag persistence. We observe that eight atomic operations are sufficient\nfor changing one zigzag filtration to another and provide an update algorithm\nfor each of them. As with the zigzag persistence algorithms for a static\nfiltration, these updates are implemented with the maintenance of\nrepresentatives. Since finding consistent representatives for zigzag\npersistence is more involved, the updates for the zigzag case are more costly\nthan their counterparts in the non-zigzag case. As motivations, we identify\nsome potential use of our update algorithms including the case of dynamic point\ncloud data, where a vineyard of zigzag persistence diagrams captures changing\nhomological features across distance and time.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical classification aims to sort the object into a hierarchy of\ncategories. For example, a bird can be categorized according to a three-level\nhierarchy of order, family, and species. Existing methods commonly address\nhierarchical classification by decoupling it into several multi-class\nclassification tasks. However, such a multi-task learning strategy fails to\nfully exploit the correlation among various categories across different\nhierarchies. In this paper, we propose Label Hierarchy Transition, a unified\nprobabilistic framework based on deep learning, to address hierarchical\nclassification. Specifically, we explicitly learn the label hierarchy\ntransition matrices, whose column vectors represent the conditional label\ndistributions of classes between two adjacent hierarchies and could be capable\nof encoding the correlation embedded in class hierarchies. We further propose a\nconfusion loss, which encourages the classification network to learn the\ncorrelation across different label hierarchies during training. The proposed\nframework can be adapted to any existing deep network with only minor\nmodifications. We experiment with three public benchmark datasets with various\nclass hierarchies, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our approach\nbeyond the prior arts.

    "abstract": "In Test-time Adaptation (TTA), given a model trained on some source data, the\ngoal is to adapt it to make better predictions for test instances from a\ndifferent distribution. Crucially, TTA assumes no access to the source data or\neven any additional labeled/unlabeled samples from the target distribution to\nfinetune the source model. In this work, we consider TTA in a more pragmatic\nsetting which we refer to as SITA (Single Image Test-time Adaptation). Here,\nwhen making each prediction, the model has access only to the given\n\\emph{single} test instance, rather than a \\emph{batch} of instances, as has\ntypically been considered in the literature. This is motivated by the realistic\nscenarios where inference is needed in an on-demand fashion that may not be\ndelayed to \"batch-ify\" incoming requests or the inference is happening on an\nedge device (like mobile phone) where there is no scope for batching. The\nentire adaptation process in SITA should be extremely fast as it happens at\ninference time. To address this, we propose a novel approach AugBN for the SITA\nsetting that requires only forward propagation. The approach can adapt any\noff-the-shelf trained model to individual test instances for both\nclassification and segmentation tasks. AugBN estimates normalisation statistics\nof the unseen test distribution from the given test image using only one\nforward pass with label-preserving transformations. Since AugBN does not\ninvolve any back-propagation, it is significantly faster compared to other\nrecent methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that\naddresses this hard adaptation problem using only a single test image. Despite\nbeing very simple, our framework is able to achieve significant performance\ngains compared to directly applying the source model on the target instances,\nas reflected in our extensive experiments and ablation studies.",

This\npaper presents a simple posture control concept from neuroscience, called\ndisturbance estimation and compensation, DEC concept [1]. It provides\nhuman-like mechanical compliance due to low loop gain, tolerance of time\ndelays, and automatic adjustment to changes in external disturbance scenarios.\nIts outstanding feature is that it uses feedback of multisensory disturbance\nestimates rather than 'raw' sensory signals for disturbance compensation. After\nproof-of-principle tests in 1 and 2 DOF posture control robots, we present here\na generalized DEC control module for multi-DOF robots. In the control layout,\none DEC module controls one DOF (modular control architecture). Modules of\nneighboring joints are synergistically interconnected using vestibular\ninformation in combination with joint angle and torque signals. These sensory\ninterconnections allow each module to control the kinematics of the more distal\nlinks as if they were a single link. This modular design makes the complexity\nof the robot control scale linearly with the DOFs and error robustness high\ncompared to monolithic control architectures.

Existing methods assume that\nthe source data is available along with the target data during adaptation.\nHowever, in practical scenarios, we may only have access to the source model\nand the unlabeled target data, but not the labeled source, due to reasons such\nas privacy, storage, etc. In this work, we propose a self-training approach to\nextract the knowledge from the source model.

    "abstract": "The prosperity of mobile and financial technologies has bred and expanded\nvarious kinds of financial products to a broader scope of people, which\ncontributes to advocating financial inclusion. It has non-trivial social\nbenefits of diminishing financial inequality. However, the technical challenges\nin individual financial risk evaluation caused by the distinct characteristic\ndistribution and limited credit history of new users, as well as the\ninexperience of newly-entered companies in handling complex data and obtaining\naccurate labels, impede further promoting financial inclusion. To tackle these\nchallenges, this paper develops a novel transfer learning algorithm (i.e.,\nTransBoost) that combines the merits of tree-based models and kernel methods.\nThe TransBoost is designed with a parallel tree structure and efficient weights\nupdating mechanism with theoretical guarantee, which enables it to excel in\ntackling real-world data with high dimensional features and sparsity in $O(n)$\ntime complexity. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets and a\nunique large-scale dataset from Tencent Mobile Payment. The results show that\nthe TransBoost outperforms other state-of-the-art benchmark transfer learning\nalgorithms in terms of prediction accuracy with superior efficiency, shows\nstronger robustness to data sparsity, and provides meaningful model\ninterpretation. Besides, given a financial risk level, the TransBoost enables\nfinancial service providers to serve the largest number of users including\nthose who would otherwise be excluded by other algorithms.

Given a non-trivial cycle in a homology class, we consider the problem\nof computing a representative in that homology class which is optimal. We study\ntwo measures of optimality, namely, the lexicographic order of cycles (the\nlex-optimal cycle) and the bottleneck norm (a bottleneck-optimal cycle). We\ngive a simple algorithm for computing the lex-optimal cycle for a 1-homology\nclass in a surface. In contrast to this, our main result is that, in the case\nof 3-manifolds of size $n^2$ in the Euclidean 3-space, the problem of finding a\nbottleneck optimal cycle cannot be solved more efficiently than solving a\nsystem of linear equations with a $n \\times n$ sparse matrix.

However, there are\nno known results in which the deeper architecture leverages this advantage into\na provable optimization guarantee. We prove that when the data are generated by\na distribution with radial symmetry which satisfies some mild assumptions,\ngradient descent can efficiently learn ball indicator functions using a depth 2\nneural network with two layers of sigmoidal activations, and where the hidden\nlayer is held fixed throughout training. Since it is known that ball indicators\nare hard to approximate with respect to a certain heavy-tailed distribution\nwhen using depth 2 networks with a single layer of non-linearities (Safran and\nShamir, 2017), this establishes what is to the best of our knowledge, the first\noptimization-based separation result where the approximation benefits of the\nstronger architecture provably manifest in practice. Our proof technique relies\non a random features approach which reduces the problem to learning with a\nsingle neuron, where new tools are required to show the convergence of gradient\ndescent when the distribution of the data is heavy-tailed.",

    "abstract": "Distributed in-memory datastores underpin cloud applications that run within\na datacenter and demand high performance, strong consistency, and availability.\nA key feature of datastores is data replication. The data are replicated across\nservers because a single server often cannot handle the request load.\nReplication is also necessary to guarantee that a server or link failure does\nnot render a portion of the dataset inaccessible. A replication protocol is\nresponsible for ensuring strong consistency between the replicas of a\ndatastore, even when faults occur, by determining the actions necessary to\naccess and manipulate the data. Consequently, a replication protocol also\ndrives the datastore's performance.\nExisting strongly consistent replication protocols deliver fault tolerance\nbut fall short in terms of performance. Meanwhile, the opposite occurs in the\nworld of multiprocessors, where data are replicated across the private caches\nof different cores. The multiprocessor regime uses invalidations to afford\nstrongly consistent replication with high performance but neglects fault\ntolerance.\nAlthough handling failures in the datacenter is critical for data\navailability, we observe that the common operation is fault-free and far\nexceeds the operation during faults. In other words, the common operating\nenvironment inside a datacenter closely resembles that of a multiprocessor.\nBased on this insight, we draw inspiration from the multiprocessor for\nhigh-performance, strongly consistent replication in the datacenter. The\nprimary contribution of this thesis is in adapting invalidating protocols to\nthe nuances of replicated datastores, which include skewed data accesses, fault\ntolerance, and distributed transactions.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, with the increase in the amount of information generated in the\nwebspace, many web service providers try to use recommender systems to\npersonalize their services and make accessing the content convenient.\nRecommender systems that only try to increase the accuracy (i.e., the\nsimilarity of items to users' interest) will face the long tail problem. It\nmeans that popular items called short heads appear in the recommendation lists\nmore than others since they have many ratings. However, unpopular items called\nlong-tail items are used less than popular ones as they reduce accuracy. Other\nstudies that solve the long-tail problem consider users' interests constant\nwhile their preferences change over time. We suggest that users' dynamic\npreferences should be taken into account to prevent the loss of accuracy when\nwe use long-tail items in recommendation lists. This study shows that the two\nreasons lie in the following: 1) Users rate for different proportions of\npopular and unpopular items over time. 2) Users of all ages have various\ninterests in popular and unpopular items. As a result, recommendation lists can\nbe created over time with a different portion of long-tail and short-head\nitems. Besides, we predict the age of users based on item ratings to use more\nlong-tail items. The results show that by considering these two reasons, the\naccuracy of recommendation lists reaches 91%. At the same time, the long tail\nproblem is better improved than other related research and provides better\ndiversity in recommendation lists in the long run.",

    "abstract": "Recently, zero-shot and few-shot learning via Contrastive Vision-Language\nPre-training (CLIP) have shown inspirational performance on 2D visual\nrecognition, which learns to match images with their corresponding texts in\nopen-vocabulary settings. However, it remains under explored that whether CLIP,\npre-trained by large-scale image-text pairs in 2D, can be generalized to 3D\nrecognition. In this paper, we identify such a setting is feasible by proposing\nPointCLIP, which conducts alignment between CLIP-encoded point cloud and 3D\ncategory texts. Specifically, we encode a point cloud by projecting it into\nmulti-view depth maps without rendering, and aggregate the view-wise zero-shot\nprediction to achieve knowledge transfer from 2D to 3D. On top of that, we\ndesign an inter-view adapter to better extract the global feature and\nadaptively fuse the few-shot knowledge learned from 3D into CLIP pre-trained in\n2D. By just fine-tuning the lightweight adapter in the few-shot settings, the\nperformance of PointCLIP could be largely improved. In addition, we observe the\ncomplementary property between PointCLIP and classical 3D-supervised networks.\nBy simple ensembling, PointCLIP boosts baseline's performance and even\nsurpasses state-of-the-art models. Therefore, PointCLIP is a promising\nalternative for effective 3D point cloud understanding via CLIP under low\nresource cost and data regime. We conduct thorough experiments on\nwidely-adopted ModelNet10, ModelNet40 and the challenging ScanObjectNN to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of PointCLIP.

    "abstract": "Gated cameras hold promise as an alternative to scanning LiDAR sensors with\nhigh-resolution 3D depth that is robust to back-scatter in fog, snow, and rain.\nInstead of sequentially scanning a scene and directly recording depth via the\nphoton time-of-flight, as in pulsed LiDAR sensors, gated imagers encode depth\nin the relative intensity of a handful of gated slices, captured at megapixel\nresolution. Although existing methods have shown that it is possible to decode\nhigh-resolution depth from such measurements, these methods require\nsynchronized and calibrated LiDAR to supervise the gated depth decoder --\nprohibiting fast adoption across geographies, training on large unpaired\ndatasets, and exploring alternative applications outside of automotive use\ncases. In this work, we fill this gap and propose an entirely self-supervised\ndepth estimation method that uses gated intensity profiles and temporal\nconsistency as a training signal. The proposed model is trained end-to-end from\ngated video sequences, does not require LiDAR or RGB data, and learns to\nestimate absolute depth values. We take gated slices as input and disentangle\nthe estimation of the scene albedo, depth, and ambient light, which are then\nused to learn to reconstruct the input slices through a cyclic loss. We rely on\ntemporal consistency between a given frame and neighboring gated slices to\nestimate depth in regions with shadows and reflections.

GNTK is an application of Neural\nTangent Kernel (NTK) [Jacot, Gabriel and Hongler 18] (a kernel method) on graph\ndata, and solving NTK regression is equivalent to using gradient descent to\ntrain an infinite-wide neural network. The key benefit of using GNTK is that,\nsimilar to any kernel method, GNTK's parameters can be solved directly in a\nsingle step. This can avoid time-consuming gradient descent. Meanwhile,\nsketching has become increasingly used in speeding up various optimization\nproblems, including solving kernel regression. Given a kernel matrix of $n$\ngraphs, using sketching in solving kernel regression can reduce the running\ntime to $o(n^3)$. But unfortunately such methods usually require extensive\nknowledge about the kernel matrix beforehand, while in the case of GNTK we find\nthat the construction of the kernel matrix is already $O(n^2N^4)$, assuming\neach graph has $N$ nodes. The kernel matrix construction time can be a major\nperformance bottleneck when the size of graphs $N$ increases. A natural\nquestion to ask is thus whether we can speed up the kernel matrix construction\nto improve GNTK regression's end-to-end running time. This paper provides the\nfirst algorithm to construct the kernel matrix in $o(n^2N^3)$ running time.",

    "abstract": "Pedestrian trajectory prediction is an important technique of autonomous\ndriving, which has become a research hot-spot in recent years. Previous methods\nmainly rely on the position relationship of pedestrians to model social\ninteraction, which is obviously not enough to represent the complex cases in\nreal situations. In addition, most of existing work usually introduce the scene\ninteraction module as an independent branch and embed the social interaction\nfeatures in the process of trajectory generation, rather than simultaneously\ncarrying out the social interaction and scene interaction, which may undermine\nthe rationality of trajectory prediction. In this paper, we propose one new\nprediction model named Social Soft Attention Graph Convolution Network (SSAGCN)\nwhich aims to simultaneously handle social interactions among pedestrians and\nscene interactions between pedestrians and environments. In detail, when\nmodeling social interaction, we propose a new \\emph{social soft attention\nfunction}, which fully considers various interaction factors among pedestrians.\nAnd it can distinguish the influence of pedestrians around the agent based on\ndifferent factors under various situations. For the physical interaction, we\npropose one new \\emph{sequential scene sharing mechanism}. The influence of the\nscene on one agent at each moment can be shared with other neighbors through\nsocial soft attention, therefore the influence of the scene is expanded both in\nspatial and temporal dimension. With the help of these improvements, we\nsuccessfully obtain socially and physically acceptable predicted trajectories.\nThe experiments on public available datasets prove the effectiveness of SSAGCN\nand have achieved state-of-the-art results.",

    "abstract": "Occluded person re-identification is a challenging task as human body parts\ncould be occluded by some obstacles (e.g. trees, cars, and pedestrians) in\ncertain scenes. Some existing pose-guided methods solve this problem by\naligning body parts according to graph matching, but these graph-based methods\nare not intuitive and complicated. Therefore, we propose a transformer-based\nPose-guided Feature Disentangling (PFD) method by utilizing pose information to\nclearly disentangle semantic components (e.g. human body or joint parts) and\nselectively match non-occluded parts correspondingly. First, Vision Transformer\n(ViT) is used to extract the patch features with its strong capability. Second,\nto preliminarily disentangle the pose information from patch information, the\nmatching and distributing mechanism is leveraged in Pose-guided Feature\nAggregation (PFA) module. Third, a set of learnable semantic views are\nintroduced in transformer decoder to implicitly enhance the disentangled body\npart features. However, those semantic views are not guaranteed to be related\nto the body without additional supervision. Therefore, Pose-View Matching (PVM)\nmodule is proposed to explicitly match visible body parts and automatically\nseparate occlusion features. Fourth, to better prevent the interference of\nocclusions, we design a Pose-guided Push Loss to emphasize the features of\nvisible body parts. Extensive experiments over five challenging datasets for\ntwo tasks (occluded and holistic Re-ID) demonstrate that our proposed PFD is\nsuperior promising, which performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.\nCode is available at https://github.com/WangTaoAs/PFD_Net",

We implemented these solutions on a testbed and results show\nthat PS3A and TSP3A provide authentication within 0.345-2.858s for a 0-100 Mbps\nproxy load.

    "abstract": "We propose an end-to-end architecture for facial expression recognition. Our\nmodel learns an optimal tree topology for facial landmarks, whose traversal\ngenerates a sequence from which we obtain an embedding to feed a sequential\nlearner. The proposed architecture incorporates two main streams, one focusing\non landmark positions to learn the structure of the face, while the other\nfocuses on patches around the landmarks to learn texture information. Each\nstream is followed by an attention mechanism and the outputs are fed to a\ntwo-stream fusion component to perform the final classification. We conduct\nextensive experiments on two large-scale publicly available facial expression\ndatasets, AffectNet and FER2013, to evaluate the efficacy of our approach. Our\nmethod outperforms other solutions in the area and sets new state-of-the-art\nexpression recognition rates on these datasets.",

In\nthe proposed search space, IF-NAS outperform both random sampling and previous\nweight-sharing search algorithms by a significant margin.

In this paper, we show that it is beneficial to augment\ndistillation with a third objective that encourages the student to imitate the\ncausal computation process of the teacher through interchange intervention\ntraining(IIT).

    "abstract": "De-homogenization is becoming an effective method to significantly expedite\nthe design of high-resolution multiscale structures, but existing methods have\nthus far been confined to simple static compliance minimization. There are two\ncritical challenges to be addressed in accommodating general cases: enabling\nthe design of unit-cell orientation and using free-form microstructures. In\nthis paper, we propose a data-driven de-homogenization method that allows\neffective design of the unit-cell orientation angles and conformal mapping of\nspatially varying, complex microstructures. We devise a parameterized\nmicrostructure composed of rods in different directions to provide more\ndiversity in stiffness while retaining geometrical simplicity. The\nmicrostructural geometry-property relationship is then surrogated by a neural\nnetwork to avoid costly homogenization. A Cartesian representation of the\nunit-cell orientation is incorporated into homogenization-based optimization to\ndesign the angles. Corresponding high-resolution multiscale structures are\nobtained from the homogenization-based designs through a conformal mapping\nconstructed with sawtooth function fields. This allows us to assemble complex\nmicrostructures with an oriented and compatible tiling pattern, while\npreserving the local homogenized properties. To demonstrate our method with a\nspecific application, we optimize the frequency response of structures under\nharmonic excitations within a given frequency range. It is the first time that\na sawtooth function is applied in a de-homogenization framework for complex\ndesign scenarios beyond static compliance minimization. The examples illustrate\nthat multiscale structures can be generated with high efficiency and much\nbetter dynamic performance compared with the macroscale-only optimization.\nBeyond frequency response design, our proposed framework can be applied to\nother general problems.",

However, measuring the importance of each\nneuron is an NP-hard problem. Previous works have proposed to trim by\nconsidering the statistics of a single layer or a plurality of successive\nlayers of neurons. These works cannot eliminate the influence of different data\non the model in the reconstruction error, and currently, there is no work to\nprove that the absolute values of the parameters can be directly used as the\nbasis for judging the importance of the weights. A more reasonable approach is\nto eliminate the difference between batch data that accurately measures the\nweight of influence. In this paper, we propose to use ensemble learning to\ntrain a model for different batches of data and use the influence function (a\nclassic technique from robust statistics) to learn the algorithm to track the\nmodel's prediction and return its training parameter gradient, so that we can\ndetermine the responsibility for each parameter, which we call \"influence\", in\nthe prediction process. In addition, we theoretically prove that the\nback-propagation of the deep network is a first-order Taylor approximation of\nthe influence function of the weights. We perform extensive experiments to\nprove that pruning based on the influence function using the idea of ensemble\nlearning will be much more effective than just focusing on error\nreconstruction.

On\nthe other hand, smoothness of the true (unknown) covariance function results in\neffective low rank approximations to the true covariance operator. We derive\nexplicit error estimates that involve the finite rank approximation error of\nthe covariance operator, the Monte-Carlo-type errors for sampling in the\nstochastic domain and the numerical discretization error in the physical\ndomain. This permits to give sufficient conditions on the three discretization\nparameters to guarantee that an error below a prescribed accuracy $\\varepsilon$\nis achieved.",

    "title": "Exploring and Mitigating Gender Bias in Recommender Systems with  Explicit Feedback",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems are indispensable because they influence our day-to-day\nbehavior and decisions by giving us personalized suggestions. Services like\nKindle, Youtube, and Netflix depend heavily on the performance of their\nrecommender systems to ensure that their users have a good experience and to\nincrease revenues. Despite their popularity, it has been shown that recommender\nsystems reproduce and amplify the bias present in the real world. The resulting\nfeedback creates a self-perpetuating loop that deteriorates the user experience\nand results in homogenizing recommendations over time. Further, biased\nrecommendations can also reinforce stereotypes based on gender or ethnicity,\nthus reinforcing the filter bubbles that we live in. In this paper, we address\nthe problem of gender bias in recommender systems with explicit feedback. We\npropose a model to quantify the gender bias present in book rating datasets and\nin the recommendations produced by the recommender systems. Our main\ncontribution is to provide a principled approach to mitigate the bias being\nproduced in the recommendations. We theoretically show that the proposed\napproach provides unbiased recommendations despite biased data. Through\nempirical evaluation on publicly available book rating datasets, we further\nshow that the proposed model can significantly reduce bias without significant\nimpact on accuracy. Our method is model agnostic and can be applied to any\nrecommender system. To demonstrate the performance of our model, we present the\nresults on four recommender algorithms, two from the K-nearest neighbors\nfamily, UserKNN and ItemKNN, and the other two from the matrix factorization\nfamily, Alternating least square and Singular value decomposition.",

    "abstract": "Embedding real-world networks presents challenges because it is not clear how\nto identify their latent geometries. Embedding some disassortative networks,\nsuch as scale-free networks, to the Euclidean space has been shown to incur\ndistortions. Embedding scale-free networks to hyperbolic spaces offer an\nexciting alternative but incurs distortions when embedding assortative networks\nwith latent geometries not hyperbolic. We propose an inductive model that\nleverages both the expressiveness of GCNs and trivial bundle to learn inductive\nnode representations for networks with or without node features. A trivial\nbundle is a simple case of fiber bundles,a space that is globally a product\nspace of its base space and fiber. The coordinates of base space and those of\nfiber can be used to express the assortative and disassortative factors in\ngenerating edges. Therefore, the model has the ability to learn embeddings that\ncan express those factors. In practice, it reduces errors for link prediction\nand node classification when compared to the Euclidean and hyperbolic GCNs.",

    "abstract": "A numerical scheme is proposed for the simulation of reactive settling in\nsequencing batch reactors (SBRs) in wastewater treatment plants. Reactive\nsettling is the process of sedimentation of flocculated particles (biomass;\nactivated sludge) consisting of several material components that react with\nsubstrates dissolved in the fluid. An SBR is operated in cycles of consecutive\nfill, react, settle, draw and idle stages, which means that the volume in the\ntank varies and the surface moves with time. The process is modelled by a\nsystem of spatially one-dimensional, nonlinear, strongly degenerate parabolic\nconvection-diffusion-reaction equations. This system is coupled via conditions\nof mass conservation to transport equations on a half line whose origin is\nlocated at a moving boundary and that models the effluent pipe. A\nfinite-difference scheme is proved to satisfy an invariant-region property (in\nparticular, it is positivity preserving) if executed in a simple splitting way.\nSimulations are presented with a modified variant of the established activated\nsludge model no.~1 (ASM1).",

    "abstract": "Active learning is an established technique to reduce the labeling cost to\nbuild high-quality machine learning models. A core component of active learning\nis the acquisition function that determines which data should be selected to\nannotate. State-of-the-art acquisition functions -- and more largely, active\nlearning techniques -- have been designed to maximize the clean performance\n(e.g. accuracy) and have disregarded robustness, an important quality property\nthat has received increasing attention. Active learning, therefore, produces\nmodels that are accurate but not robust.\nIn this paper, we propose \\emph{robust active learning}, an active learning\nprocess that integrates adversarial training -- the most established method to\nproduce robust models. Via an empirical study on 11 acquisition functions, 4\ndatasets, 6 DNN architectures, and 15105 trained DNNs, we show that robust\nactive learning can produce models with the robustness (accuracy on adversarial\nexamples) ranging from 2.35\\% to 63.85\\%, whereas standard active learning\nsystematically achieves negligible robustness (less than 0.20\\%). Our study\nalso reveals, however, that the acquisition functions that perform well on\naccuracy are worse than random sampling when it comes to robustness. We,\ntherefore, examine the reasons behind this and devise a new acquisition\nfunction that targets both clean performance and robustness. Our acquisition\nfunction -- named density-based robust sampling with entropy (DRE) --\noutperforms the other acquisition functions (including random) in terms of\nrobustness by up to 24.40\\% (3.84\\% than random particularly), while remaining\ncompetitive on accuracy. Additionally, we prove that DRE is applicable as a\ntest selection metric for model retraining and stands out from all compared\nfunctions by up to 8.21\\% robustness.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to integrate two synergetic technologies, federated learning\n(FL) and width-adjustable slimmable neural network (SNN) architectures. FL\npreserves data privacy by exchanging the locally trained models of mobile\ndevices. By adopting SNNs as local models, FL can flexibly cope with the\ntime-varying energy capacities of mobile devices. Combining FL and SNNs is\nhowever non-trivial, particularly under wireless connections with time-varying\nchannel conditions. Furthermore, existing multi-width SNN training algorithms\nare sensitive to the data distributions across devices, so are ill-suited to\nFL. Motivated by this, we propose a communication and energy-efficient\nSNN-based FL (named SlimFL) that jointly utilizes superposition coding (SC) for\nglobal model aggregation and superposition training (ST) for updating local\nmodels. By applying SC, SlimFL exchanges the superposition of multiple width\nconfigurations that are decoded as many as possible for a given communication\nthroughput. Leveraging ST, SlimFL aligns the forward propagation of different\nwidth configurations, while avoiding the inter-width interference during\nbackpropagation. We formally prove the convergence of SlimFL. The result\nreveals that SlimFL is not only communication-efficient but also can counteract\nnon-IID data distributions and poor channel conditions, which is also\ncorroborated by simulations.",

WHO guidelines were utilized to validate the\nfeasibility of comment-derived evidence assertions as a fast decision\nsupporting tool.

Conclusions: Comment-derived evidence assertions have the potential\nas an evidence appraisal tool for heuristic decisions based on the accuracy,\nsensitivity, and efficiency of evidence-comment networks.

These sensors are\nused for image processing, target tracking, surveillance, mapping, and\nproviding high-resolution imagery for environmental surveys. It is crucial to\nobtain a steady image in all these applications. This is typically accomplished\nby using multi-axis gimbal systems. This paper concentrates on the modeling and\ncontrol of a multi-axis gimbal system. A novel and fully outlined procedure is\nproposed to derive the nonlinear and highly coupled Equations of Motion of the\ntwo-axis gimbal system. Different from the existing literature, Forward\nDynamics of the two-axis gimbal system is modeled using multi-body dynamics\nmodeling techniques. In addition to the Forward Dynamics model, the Inverse\nDynamics model is developed to estimate the complementary torques associated\nwith the state and mechanism-dependent, complex disturbances acting on the\nsystem. A disturbance compensator based on multilayer perceptron (MLP)\nstructure is implemented to cope with external and internal disturbances and\nparameter uncertainties through the torque input channel. Our initial\nsimulations and experimental work show that the new NN (neural network)-based\ncontroller is performs better in the full operational range without requiring\nany tuning or adjustment when compared with well-known controllers such as\ncascaded PID, ADRC (Active Disturbance Rejection Control), Inverse Dynamics\nbased controllers.",

    "abstract": "Goal-achieving problems are puzzles that set up a specific situation with a\nclear objective. An example that is well-studied is the category of\nlife-and-death (L&D) problems for Go, which helps players hone their skill of\nidentifying region safety. Many previous methods like lambda search try null\nmoves first, then derive so-called relevance zones (RZs), outside of which the\nopponent does not need to search. This paper first proposes a novel RZ-based\napproach, called the RZ-Based Search (RZS), to solving L&D problems for Go. RZS\ntries moves before determining whether they are null moves post-hoc. This means\nwe do not need to rely on null move heuristics, resulting in a more elegant\nalgorithm, so that it can also be seamlessly incorporated into AlphaZero's\nsuper-human level play in our solver. To repurpose AlphaZero for solving, we\nalso propose a new training method called Faster to Life (FTL), which modifies\nAlphaZero to entice it to win more quickly. We use RZS and FTL to solve L&D\nproblems on Go, namely solving 68 among 106 problems from a professional L&D\nbook while a previous program solves 11 only. Finally, we discuss that the\napproach is generic in the sense that RZS is applicable to solving many other\ngoal-achieving problems for board games.",

In the\ncurrent study, an eye-brain hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) interaction\nsystem was introduced for intention detection through fusion of multi-modal\neye-track and ERP (a measurement derived from EEG) features.

The\ncorresponding fixation duration of eye-tracking and ERP were extracted. Five\npreviously-validated LDA-based classifiers (including RLDA, SWLDA, BLDA, SKLDA,\nand STDA) and the widely-used CNN method were adopted to verify the efficacy of\nfeature fusion from both offline and pseudo-online analysis, and optimal\napproach was evaluated through modulating the training set and system response\nduration.

    "abstract": "We present a Siamese-like Dual-branch network based on solely Transformers\nfor tracking. Given a template and a search image, we divide them into\nnon-overlapping patches and extract a feature vector for each patch based on\nits matching results with others within an attention window. For each token, we\nestimate whether it contains the target object and the corresponding size. The\nadvantage of the approach is that the features are learned from matching, and\nultimately, for matching. So the features are aligned with the object tracking\ntask. The method achieves better or comparable results as the best-performing\nmethods which first use CNN to extract features and then use Transformer to\nfuse them. It outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the GOT-10k and\nVOT2020 benchmarks. In addition, the method achieves real-time inference speed\n(about $40$ fps) on one GPU.

Because of the complexity of surgical\nprocedures, the variation of operation styles, and the fast development of new\nsurgical skills, the surgical skill assessment remains a challenging problem.\nThis work presents a novel Gaussian Process Learning-based heuristic automatic\nobjective surgical skill assessment method for ESSBSs. Different with classical\nsurgical skill assessment algorithms, the proposed method 1) utilizes the\nkinematic features in surgical instrument relative movements, instead of using\nspecific surgical tasks or the statistics to assess skills in real-time; 2)\nprovide informative feedback, instead of a summative scores; 3) has the ability\nto incrementally learn from new data, instead of depending on a fixed dataset.\nThe proposed method projects the instrument movements into the endoscope\ncoordinate to reduce the data dimensionality. It then extracts the kinematic\nfeatures of the projected data and learns the relationship between surgical\nskill levels and the features with the Gaussian Process learning technique. The\nproposed method was verified in full endoscopic skull base and sinus surgeries\non cadavers.

How to effectively measure the\nsimilarity between different modality data is the major challenge of\ncross-modal retrieval. Although several reasearch works have calculated the\ncorrelation between different modality data via learning a common subspace\nrepresentation, the encoder's ability to extract features from multi-modal\ninformation is not satisfactory. In this paper, we present a novel variational\nautoencoder (VAE) architecture for audio-visual cross-modal retrieval, by\nlearning paired audio-visual correlation embedding and category correlation\nembedding as constraints to reinforce the mutuality of audio-visual\ninformation. On the one hand, audio encoder and visual encoder separately\nencode audio data and visual data into two different latent spaces. Further,\ntwo mutual latent spaces are respectively constructed by canonical correlation\nanalysis (CCA). On the other hand, probabilistic modeling methods is used to\ndeal with possible noise and missing information in the data. Additionally, in\nthis way, the cross-modal discrepancy from intra-modal and inter-modal\ninformation are simultaneously eliminated in the joint embedding subspace. We\nconduct extensive experiments over two benchmark datasets.

This research, bringing together psychology and machine learning,\nintroduces new techniques to differentiate Approach and Avoidance from positive\nand negative sentiment on a fundamental level of meaning. It does this by\ncomparing word-lists, previously constructed to capture these concepts in text\ndata, across a large range of semantic features.

    "title": "Probabilistic Deep Learning to Quantify Uncertainty in Air Quality  Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Data-driven forecasts of air quality have recently achieved more accurate\nshort-term predictions. Despite their success, most of the current data-driven\nsolutions lack proper quantifications of model uncertainty that communicate how\nmuch to trust the forecasts. Recently, several practical tools to estimate\nuncertainty have been developed in probabilistic deep learning. However, there\nhave not been empirical applications and extensive comparisons of these tools\nin the domain of air quality forecasts. Therefore, this work applies\nstate-of-the-art techniques of uncertainty quantification in a real-world\nsetting of air quality forecasts. Through extensive experiments, we describe\ntraining probabilistic models and evaluate their predictive uncertainties based\non empirical performance, reliability of confidence estimate, and practical\napplicability. We also propose improving these models using \"free\" adversarial\ntraining and exploiting temporal and spatial correlation inherent in air\nquality data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed models perform\nbetter than previous works in quantifying uncertainty in data-driven air\nquality forecasts. Overall, Bayesian neural networks provide a more reliable\nuncertainty estimate but can be challenging to implement and scale. Other\nscalable methods, such as deep ensemble, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and\nstochastic weight averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), can perform well if applied\ncorrectly but with different tradeoffs and slight variations in performance\nmetrics. Finally, our results show the practical impact of uncertainty\nestimation and demonstrate that, indeed, probabilistic models are more suitable\nfor making informed decisions.

    "title": "Dynamic Token Normalization Improves Vision Transformer",
    "abstract": "Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants (e.g., Swin, PVT) have achieved\ngreat success in various computer vision tasks, owing to their capability to\nlearn long-range contextual information. Layer Normalization (LN) is an\nessential ingredient in these models. However, we found that the ordinary LN\nmakes tokens at different positions similar in magnitude because it normalizes\nembeddings within each token. It is difficult for Transformers to capture\ninductive bias such as the positional context in an image with LN. We tackle\nthis problem by proposing a new normalizer, termed Dynamic Token Normalization\n(DTN), where normalization is performed both within each token (intra-token)\nand across different tokens (inter-token). DTN has several merits. Firstly, it\nis built on a unified formulation and thus can represent various existing\nnormalization methods. Secondly, DTN learns to normalize tokens in both\nintra-token and inter-token manners, enabling Transformers to capture both the\nglobal contextual information and the local positional context. {Thirdly, by\nsimply replacing LN layers, DTN can be readily plugged into various vision\ntransformers, such as ViT, Swin, PVT, LeViT, T2T-ViT, BigBird and Reformer.\nExtensive experiments show that the transformer equipped with DTN consistently\noutperforms baseline model with minimal extra parameters and computational\noverhead. For example, DTN outperforms LN by $0.5\\%$ - $1.2\\%$ top-1 accuracy\non ImageNet, by $1.2$ - $1.4$ box AP in object detection on COCO benchmark, by\n$2.3\\%$ - $3.9\\%$ mCE in robustness experiments on ImageNet-C, and by $0.5\\%$ -\n$0.8\\%$ accuracy in Long ListOps on Long-Range Arena.} Codes will be made\npublic at \\url{https://github.com/wqshao126/DTN}",

Despite the\nrecognition of the value of deep learning in healthcare, impediments to further\nadoption in real healthcare settings remain due to the black-box nature of DL.\nTherefore, there is an emerging need for interpretable DL, which allows end\nusers to evaluate the model decision making to know whether to accept or reject\npredictions and recommendations before an action is taken. In this review, we\nfocus on the interpretability of the DL models in healthcare. We start by\nintroducing the methods for interpretability in depth and comprehensively as a\nmethodological reference for future researchers or clinical practitioners in\nthis field. Besides the methods' details, we also include a discussion of\nadvantages and disadvantages of these methods and which scenarios each of them\nis suitable for, so that interested readers can know how to compare and choose\namong them for use. Moreover, we discuss how these methods, originally\ndeveloped for solving general-domain problems, have been adapted and applied to\nhealthcare problems and how they can help physicians better understand these\ndata-driven technologies. Overall, we hope this survey can help researchers and\npractitioners in both artificial intelligence (AI) and clinical fields\nunderstand what methods we have for enhancing the interpretability of their DL\nmodels and choose the optimal one accordingly.",

Machine\nlearning-based program analysis methods use variable name representations for a\nwide range of tasks, such as suggesting new variable names and bug detection.\nIdeally, such methods could capture semantic relationships between names beyond\nsyntactic similarity, e.g., the fact that the names average and mean are\nsimilar. Unfortunately, previous work has found that even the best of previous\nrepresentation approaches primarily capture relatedness (whether two variables\nare linked at all), rather than similarity (whether they actually have the same\nmeaning).\nWe propose VarCLR, a new approach for learning semantic representations of\nvariable names that effectively captures variable similarity in this stricter\nsense. We observe that this problem is an excellent fit for contrastive\nlearning, which aims to minimize the distance between explicitly similar\ninputs, while maximizing the distance between dissimilar inputs. This requires\nlabeled training data, and thus we construct a novel, weakly-supervised\nvariable renaming dataset mined from GitHub edits. We show that VarCLR enables\nthe effective application of sophisticated, general-purpose language models\nlike BERT, to variable name representation and thus also to related downstream\ntasks like variable name similarity search or spelling correction.

By carefully analyzing $i)$ the subnetworks'\nneural tangent kernel, $ii)$ the surrogate functions' gradient, and $iii)$ how\nwe sample and combine the surrogate functions, we prove linear convergence rate\nof the training error -- within an error region -- for an overparameterized\nsingle-hidden layer perceptron with ReLU activations for a regression task. Our\nresult implies that, for fixed neuron selection probability, the error term\ndecreases as we increase the number of surrogate models, and increases as we\nincrease the number of local training steps for each selected subnetwork. The\nconsidered framework generalizes and provides new insights on dropout training,\nmulti-sample dropout training, as well as Independent Subnet Training; for each\ncase, we provide corresponding convergence results, as corollaries of our main\ntheorem.",

Due to the substantial financial and intellectual\ninvestments, service providers adopt a pay-as-you-use policy to promote\nsustainable market growth. However, recent works have shown that cloud\nplatforms suffer from financial losses imposed by model extraction attacks,\nwhich aim to imitate the functionality and utility of the victim services, thus\nviolating the intellectual property (IP) of cloud APIs. This work targets at\nprotecting IP of NLG APIs by identifying the attackers who have utilized\nwatermarked responses from the victim NLG APIs. However, most existing\nwatermarking techniques are not directly amenable for IP protection of NLG\nAPIs. To bridge this gap, we first present a novel watermarking method for text\ngeneration APIs by conducting lexical modification to the original outputs.\nCompared with the competitive baselines, our watermark approach achieves better\nidentifiable performance in terms of p-value, with fewer semantic losses. In\naddition, our watermarks are more understandable and intuitive to humans than\nthe baselines. Finally, the empirical studies show our approach is also\napplicable to queries from different domains, and is effective on the attacker\ntrained on a mixture of the corpus which includes less than 10\\% watermarked\nsamples.",

We provide a\ncomprehensive overview of deep learning-based methods for six different\ndocument image enhancement tasks, including binarization, debluring, denoising,\ndefading, watermark removal, and shadow removal. We summarize the main\nstate-of-the-art works for each task and discuss their features, challenges,\nand limitations. We introduce multiple document image enhancement tasks that\nhave received no to little attention, including over and under exposure\ncorrection and bleed-through removal, and identify several other promising\nresearch directions and opportunities for future research.",

    "abstract": "The stability and ability of an ecosystem to withstand climate change is\ndirectly linked to its biodiversity. Dead trees are a key indicator of overall\nforest health, housing one-third of forest ecosystem biodiversity, and\nconstitute 8%of the global carbon stocks. They are decomposed by several\nnatural factors, e.g. climate, insects and fungi. Accurate detection and\nmodeling of dead wood mass is paramount to understanding forest ecology, the\ncarbon cycle and decomposers. We present a novel method to construct precise\nshape contours of dead trees from aerial photographs by combining established\nconvolutional neural networks with a novel active contour model in an energy\nminimization framework. Our approach yields superior performance accuracy over\nstate-of-the-art in terms of precision, recall, and intersection over union of\ndetected dead trees. This improved performance is essential to meet emerging\nchallenges caused by climate change (and other man-made perturbations to the\nsystems), particularly to monitor and estimate carbon stock decay rates,\nmonitor forest health and biodiversity, and the overall effects of dead wood on\nand from climate change.",

    "abstract": "We present a Fourier-based machine learning technique that characterizes and\ndetects facial emotions. The main challenging task in the development of\nmachine learning (ML) models for classifying facial emotions is the detection\nof accurate emotional features from a set of training samples, and the\ngeneration of feature vectors for constructing a meaningful feature space and\nbuilding ML models. In this paper, we hypothesis that the emotional features\nare hidden in the frequency domain; hence, they can be captured by leveraging\nthe frequency domain and masking techniques. We also make use of the conjecture\nthat a facial emotions are convoluted with the normal facial features and the\nother emotional features; however, they carry linearly separable spatial\nfrequencies (we call computational emotional frequencies). Hence, we propose a\ntechnique by leveraging fast Fourier transform (FFT) and rectangular\nnarrow-band frequency kernels, and the widely used Yale-Faces image dataset. We\ntest the hypothesis using the performance scores of the random forest (RF) and\nthe artificial neural network (ANN) classifiers as the measures to validate the\neffectiveness of the captured emotional frequencies. Our finding is that the\ncomputational emotional frequencies discovered by the proposed approach\nprovides meaningful emotional features that help RF and ANN achieve a high\nprecision scores above 93%, on average.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a system of financial products and services\nbuilt and delivered through smart contracts on various blockchains. In the past\nyear, DeFi has gained popularity and market capitalization. However, it has\nalso become an epicenter of cryptocurrency-related crime, in particular,\nvarious types of securities violations. The lack of Know Your Customer\nrequirements in DeFi has left governments unsure of how to handle the magnitude\nof offending in this space. This study aims to address this problem with a\nmachine learning approach to identify DeFi projects potentially engaging in\nsecurities violations based on their tokens' smart contract code. We adapt\nprior work on detecting specific types of securities violations across Ethereum\nmore broadly, building a random forest classifier based on features extracted\nfrom DeFi projects' tokens' smart contract code. The final classifier achieves\na 99.1% F1-score. Such high performance is surprising for any classification\nproblem, however, from further feature-level, we find a single feature makes\nthis a highly detectable problem. Another contribution of our study is a new\ndataset, comprised of (a) a verified ground truth dataset for tokens involved\nin securities violations and (b) a set of valid tokens from a DeFi aggregator\nwhich conducts due diligence on the projects it lists.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel model, JointLK, which solves the above\nlimitations through the joint reasoning of LMs and GNNs and the dynamic KGs\npruning mechanism. Specifically, JointLK performs joint reasoning between the\nLMs and the GNNs through a novel dense bidirectional attention module, in which\neach question token attends on KG nodes and each KG node attends on question\ntokens, and the two modal representations fuse and update mutually by\nmulti-step interactions.

    "abstract": "Traffic forecasting is important in intelligent transportation systems of\nwebs and beneficial to traffic safety, yet is very challenging because of the\ncomplex and dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies in real-world traffic systems.\nPrior methods use the pre-defined or learnable static graph to extract spatial\ncorrelations. However, the static graph-based methods fail to mine the\nevolution of the traffic network. Researchers subsequently generate the dynamic\ngraph for each time slice to reflect the changes of spatial correlations, but\nthey follow the paradigm of independently modeling spatio-temporal\ndependencies, ignoring the cross-time spatial influence. In this paper, we\npropose a novel cross-time dynamic graph-based deep learning model, named\nCDGNet, for traffic forecasting. The model is able to effectively capture the\ncross-time spatial dependence between each time slice and its historical time\nslices by utilizing the cross-time dynamic graph. Meanwhile, we design a gating\nmechanism to sparse the cross-time dynamic graph, which conforms to the sparse\nspatial correlations in the real world. Besides, we propose a novel\nencoder-decoder architecture to incorporate the cross-time dynamic graph-based\nGCN for multi-step traffic forecasting. Experimental results on three\nreal-world public traffic datasets demonstrate that CDGNet outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

    "abstract": "Traffic forecasting plays an indispensable role in the intelligent\ntransportation system, which makes daily travel more convenient and safer.\nHowever, the dynamic evolution of spatio-temporal correlations makes accurate\ntraffic forecasting very difficult. Existing work mainly employs graph neural\nnetwroks (GNNs) and deep time series models (e.g., recurrent neural networks)\nto capture complex spatio-temporal patterns in the dynamic traffic system. For\nthe spatial patterns, it is difficult for GNNs to extract the global spatial\ninformation, i.e., remote sensors information in road networks. Although we can\nuse the self-attention to extract global spatial information as in the previous\nwork, it is also accompanied by huge resource consumption. For the temporal\npatterns, traffic data have not only easy-to-recognize daily and weekly trends\nbut also difficult-to-recognize short-term noise caused by accidents (e.g., car\naccidents and thunderstorms). Prior traffic models are difficult to distinguish\nintricate temporal patterns in time series and thus hard to get accurate\ntemporal dependence. To address above issues, we propose a novel noise-aware\nefficient spatio-temporal Transformer architecture for accurate traffic\nforecasting, named STformer. STformer consists of two components, which are the\nnoise-aware temporal self-attention (NATSA) and the graph-based sparse spatial\nself-attention (GBS3A). NATSA separates the high-frequency component and the\nlow-frequency component from the time series to remove noise and capture stable\ntemporal dependence by the learnable filter and the temporal self-attention,\nrespectively. GBS3A replaces the full query in vanilla self-attention with the\ngraph-based sparse query to decrease the time and memory usage. Experiments on\nfour real-world traffic datasets show that STformer outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines with lower computational cost.",

    "abstract": "The use of algorithmic decision making systems in domains which impact the\nfinancial, social, and political well-being of people has created a demand for\nthese decision making systems to be \"fair\" under some accepted notion of\nequity. This demand has in turn inspired a large body of work focused on the\ndevelopment of fair learning algorithms which are then used in lieu of their\nconventional counterparts. Most analysis of such fair algorithms proceeds from\nthe assumption that the people affected by the algorithmic decisions are\nrepresented as immutable feature vectors. However, strategic agents may possess\nboth the ability and the incentive to manipulate this observed feature vector\nin order to attain a more favorable outcome. We explore the impact that\nstrategic agent behavior could have on fair classifiers and derive conditions\nunder which this behavior leads to fair classifiers becoming less fair than\ntheir conventional counterparts under the same measure of fairness that the\nfair classifier takes into account. These conditions are related to the the way\nin which the fair classifier remedies unfairness on the original unmanipulated\ndata: fair classifiers which remedy unfairness by becoming more selective than\ntheir conventional counterparts are the ones that become less fair than their\ncounterparts when agents are strategic. We further demonstrate that both the\nincreased selectiveness of the fair classifier, and consequently the loss of\nfairness, arises when performing fair learning on domains in which the\nadvantaged group is overrepresented in the region near (and on the beneficial\nside of) the decision boundary of conventional classifiers. Finally, we observe\nexperimentally, using several datasets and learning methods, that this fairness\nreversal is common, and that our theoretical characterization of the fairness\nreversal conditions indeed holds in most such cases.",

    "abstract": "As powerful as fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) is, responding your\nquery with a bird name of \"Whip-poor-will\" or \"Mallard\" probably does not make\nmuch sense. This however commonly accepted in the literature, underlines a\nfundamental question interfacing AI and human -- what constitutes transferable\nknowledge for human to learn from AI? This paper sets out to answer this very\nquestion using FGVC as a test bed. Specifically, we envisage a scenario where a\ntrained FGVC model (the AI expert) functions as a knowledge provider in\nenabling average people (you and me) to become better domain experts ourselves,\ni.e. those capable in distinguishing between \"Whip-poor-will\" and \"Mallard\".\nFig. 1 lays out our approach in answering this question. Assuming an AI expert\ntrained using expert human labels, we ask (i) what is the best transferable\nknowledge we can extract from AI, and (ii) what is the most practical means to\nmeasure the gains in expertise given that knowledge? On the former, we propose\nto represent knowledge as highly discriminative visual regions that are\nexpert-exclusive. For that, we devise a multi-stage learning framework, which\nstarts with modelling visual attention of domain experts and novices before\ndiscriminatively distilling their differences to acquire the expert exclusive\nknowledge. For the latter, we simulate the evaluation process as book guide to\nbest accommodate the learning practice of what is accustomed to humans. A\ncomprehensive human study of 15,000 trials shows our method is able to\nconsistently improve people of divergent bird expertise to recognise once\nunrecognisable birds. Interestingly, our approach also leads to improved\nconventional FGVC performance when the extracted knowledge defined is utilised\nas means to achieve discriminative localisation.

    "abstract": "Audio-driven one-shot talking face generation methods are usually trained on\nvideo resources of various persons. However, their created videos often suffer\nunnatural mouth shapes and asynchronous lips because those methods struggle to\nlearn a consistent speech style from different speakers. We observe that it\nwould be much easier to learn a consistent speech style from a specific\nspeaker, which leads to authentic mouth movements. Hence, we propose a novel\none-shot talking face generation framework by exploring consistent correlations\nbetween audio and visual motions from a specific speaker and then transferring\naudio-driven motion fields to a reference image. Specifically, we develop an\nAudio-Visual Correlation Transformer (AVCT) that aims to infer talking motions\nrepresented by keypoint based dense motion fields from an input audio. In\nparticular, considering audio may come from different identities in deployment,\nwe incorporate phonemes to represent audio signals. In this manner, our AVCT\ncan inherently generalize to audio spoken by other identities. Moreover, as\nface keypoints are used to represent speakers, AVCT is agnostic against\nappearances of the training speaker, and thus allows us to manipulate face\nimages of different identities readily. Considering different face shapes lead\nto different motions, a motion field transfer module is exploited to reduce the\naudio-driven dense motion field gap between the training identity and the\none-shot reference. Once we obtained the dense motion field of the reference\nimage, we employ an image renderer to generate its talking face videos from an\naudio clip. Thanks to our learned consistent speaking style, our method\ngenerates authentic mouth shapes and vivid movements. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our synthesized videos outperform the state-of-the-art in\nterms of visual quality and lip-sync.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a framework for single-view hand mesh\nreconstruction, which can simultaneously achieve high reconstruction accuracy,\nfast inference speed, and temporal coherence. Specifically, for 2D encoding, we\npropose lightweight yet effective stacked structures. Regarding 3D decoding, we\nprovide an efficient graph operator, namely depth-separable spiral convolution.\nMoreover, we present a novel feature lifting module for bridging the gap\nbetween 2D and 3D representations. This module starts with a map-based position\nregression (MapReg) block to integrate the merits of both heatmap encoding and\nposition regression paradigms to improve 2D accuracy and temporal coherence.\nFurthermore, MapReg is followed by pose pooling and pose-to-vertex lifting\napproaches, which transform 2D pose encodings to semantic features of 3D\nvertices. Overall, our hand reconstruction framework, called MobRecon,\ncomprises affordable computational costs and miniature model size, which\nreaches a high inference speed of 83FPS on Apple A14 CPU. Extensive experiments\non popular datasets such as FreiHAND, RHD, and HO3Dv2 demonstrate that our\nMobRecon achieves superior performance on reconstruction accuracy and temporal\ncoherence.

    "abstract": "With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources, power system\noperation has to be adapted to ensure the system stability and security while\nconsidering the distinguished feature of the Power Electronics (PE) interfaced\ngenerators. The static voltage stability which is mainly compromised by heavy\nloading conditions in conventional power systems, faces new challenges due to\nthe large scale integration of PE-interfaced devices. This paper investigates\nthe static voltage stability problem in high PE-penetrated system. The analytic\ncriterion that ensures the voltage stability at the Inverter-Based Generator\n(IBG) buses are derived with the interaction of different IBGs being\nconsidered. Based on this, an optimal system scheduling model is proposed to\nminimize the overall system operation cost while maintaining the voltage\nstability during normal operation through dynamically optimizing the active and\nreactive power output from IBGs. The highly nonlinear voltage stability\nconstraints are effectively converted into Second-Order-Cone (SOC) form,\nleading to an overall Mixed-Integer SOC Programming (MISOCP), together with the\nSOC reformulation of AC power flow and frequency constraints. The effectiveness\nof the proposed model and the impact of various factors on voltage stability\nare demonstrated in thorough case studies.",

    "abstract": "Logging is a significant programming practice. Due to the highly\ntransactional nature of modern software applications, massive amount of logs\nare generated every day, which may overwhelm developers. Logging information\noverload can be dangerous to software applications. Using log levels,\ndevelopers can print the useful information while hiding the verbose logs\nduring software runtime. As software evolves, the log levels of logging\nstatements associated with the surrounding software feature implementation may\nalso need to be altered. Maintaining log levels necessitates a significant\namount of manual effort. In this paper, we demonstrate an automated approach\nthat can rejuvenate feature log levels by matching the interest level of\ndevelopers in the surrounding features. The approach is implemented as an\nopen-source Eclipse plugin, using two external plug-ins (JGit and Mylyn). It\nwas tested on 18 open-source Java projects consisting of ~3 million lines of\ncode and ~4K log statements. Our tool successfully analyzes 99.22% of logging\nstatements, increases log level distributions by ~20%, and increases the focus\nof logs in bug fix contexts ~83% of the time.

However, such large-scale\nannotations are difficult and expensive to obtain in real-world applications,\nthus models that can generalize well from a small amount of labelled data are\ndesired. We investigate this problem of few-shot fashion landmark detection,\nwhere only a few labelled samples are available for an unseen task. This work\nproposes a novel framework named MetaCloth via meta-learning, which is able to\nlearn unseen tasks of dense fashion landmark detection with only a few\nannotated samples. Unlike previous meta-learning work that focus on solving\n\"N-way K-shot\" tasks, where each task predicts N number of classes by training\nwith K annotated samples for each class (N is fixed for all seen and unseen\ntasks), a task in MetaCloth detects N different landmarks for different\nclothing categories using K samples, where N varies across tasks, because\ndifferent clothing categories usually have various number of landmarks.\nTherefore, numbers of parameters are various for different seen and unseen\ntasks in MetaCloth. MetaCloth is carefully designed to dynamically generate\ndifferent numbers of parameters for different tasks, and learn a generalizable\nfeature extraction network from a few annotated samples with a set of good\ninitialization parameters.

Since ground truth depth is readily available in the simulation domain\nbut quite difficult to obtain in the real domain, we propose a method that\nleverages the best of both worlds. In this paper we present a new framework,\nActiveZero, which is a mixed domain learning solution for active stereovision\nsystems that requires no real world depth annotation. First, we demonstrate the\ntransferability of our method to out-of-distribution real data by using a mixed\ndomain learning strategy. In the simulation domain, we use a combination of\nsupervised disparity loss and self-supervised losses on a shape primitives\ndataset. By contrast, in the real domain, we only use self-supervised losses on\na dataset that is out-of-distribution from either training simulation data or\ntest real data. Second, our method introduces a novel self-supervised loss\ncalled temporal IR reprojection to increase the robustness and accuracy of our\nreprojections in hard-to-perceive regions. Finally, we show how the method can\nbe trained end-to-end and that each module is important for attaining the end\nresult.

    "abstract": "Recently, sequential recommendation systems are important in solving the\ninformation overload in many online services. Current methods in sequential\nrecommendation focus on learning a fixed number of representations for each\nuser at any time, with a single representation or multi-interest\nrepresentations for the user. However, when a user is exploring items on an\ne-commerce recommendation system, the number of this user's interests may\nchange overtime (e.g. increase/reduce one interest), affected by the user's\nevolving self needs. Moreover, different users may have various number of\ninterests. In this paper, we argue that it is meaningful to explore a\npersonalized dynamic number of user interests, and learn a dynamic group of\nuser interest representations accordingly. We propose a Reinforced sequential\nmodel with dynamic number of interest representations for recommendation\nsystems (RDRSR). Specifically, RDRSR is composed of a dynamic interest\ndiscriminator (DID) module and a dynamic interest allocator (DIA) module. The\nDID module explores the number of a user's interests by learning the overall\nsequential characteristics with bi-directional self-attention and\nGumbel-Softmax. The DIA module allocates the historical clicked items into a\ngroup of sub-sequences and constructs user's dynamic interest representations.\nWe formalize the allocation problem in the form of Markov Decision\nProcess(MDP), and sample an action from policy pi for each item to determine\nwhich sub-sequence it belongs to. Additionally, experiments on the real-world\ndatasets demonstrates our model's effectiveness.",

The challenges lie in three aspects: 1) the diversity of tasks, 2)\nthe simplicity of guidance maps, and 3) the execution efficiency. To address\nthese challenges, our key idea is to use a novel feed-forward multi-view and\nmulti-stage synthesis procedure consisting of I) a global view structure\nalignment stage, II) a local view texture refinement stage, and III) a holistic\neffect enhancement stage to synthesize high-quality results with coherent\nstructures and fine texture details in a coarse-to-fine fashion. In addition,\nwe also introduce a novel learning-free view-specific texture reformation\n(VSTR) operation with a new semantic map guidance strategy to achieve more\naccurate semantic-guided and structure-preserved texture transfer. The\nexperimental results on a variety of application scenarios demonstrate the\neffectiveness and superiority of our framework. And compared with the\nstate-of-the-art interactive texture transfer algorithms, it not only achieves\nhigher quality results but, more remarkably, also is 2-5 orders of magnitude\nfaster.

We present HumanNeRF - a generalizable neural representation - for\nhigh-fidelity free-view synthesis of dynamic humans. Analogous to how IBRNet\nassists NeRF by avoiding per-scene training, HumanNeRF employs an aggregated\npixel-alignment feature across multi-view inputs along with a pose embedded\nnon-rigid deformation field for tackling dynamic motions. The raw HumanNeRF can\nalready produce reasonable rendering on sparse video inputs of unseen subjects\nand camera settings. To further improve the rendering quality, we augment our\nsolution with an appearance blending module for combining the benefits of both\nneural volumetric rendering and neural texture blending.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully employed in a multitude of\napplications with remarkable performance. As such performance is achieved at a\nsignificant computational cost, several embedded applications demand fast and\nefficient hardware accelerators for DNNs. Previously proposed application\nspecific integrated circuit (ASIC) architectures strive to utilize arrays of\nhundreds of processing elements (PEs) and reduce power-hungry DRAM accesses\nusing multiple dataflows requiring complex PE architectures. These consume\nsignificant area and reduce the maximum clock frequency. This paper introduces\nthe Kraken architecture, which optimally processes the convolutional layers,\nfully-connected layers, and matrix products of any DNN through a\nhardware-friendly uniform dataflow. This enables maximal data reuse of weights,\ninputs, and outputs, with a bare-bones PE design and on-the-fly dynamic\nreconfiguration. Kraken, implemented in 65-nm CMOS technology at 400 MHz, packs\n672 PEs in 7.3 mm2, with a peak performance of 537.6 Gops. Kraken processes the\nconvolutional layers of AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet-50 at 336.6, 17.5, and 64.2\nframes/s, respectively, hence outperforming the state-of-the-art ASIC\narchitectures in terms of overall performance efficiency, DRAM accesses,\narithmetic intensity, and throughput, with 5.8x more Gops/mm2 and 1.6x more\nGops/W.",

Unlike the\nmajority of the research in VAE-VC which focuses on utilizing auxiliary losses\nor discretizing latent variables, this paper investigates how an increasing\nmodel expressiveness has benefits and impacts on the VAE-VC. Specifically, we\nfirst analyze VAE-VC from a rate-distortion perspective, and point out that\nmodel expressiveness is significant for VAE-VC because rate and distortion\nreflect similarity and naturalness of converted speeches. Based on the\nanalysis, we propose a novel VC method using a deep hierarchical VAE, which has\nhigh model expressiveness as well as having fast conversion speed thanks to its\nnon-autoregressive decoder. Also, our analysis reveals another problem that\nsimilarity can be degraded when the latent variable of VAEs has redundant\ninformation. We address the problem by controlling the information contained in\nthe latent variable using $\\beta$-VAE objective. In the experiment using VCTK\ncorpus, the proposed method achieved mean opinion scores higher than 3.5 on\nboth naturalness and similarity in inter-gender settings, which are higher than\nthe scores of existing autoencoder-based VC methods.",

The rapid\ndevelopment of artificial intelligence research has created efficient methods\nfor solving MDPs, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), reinforcement learning\n(RL), and imitation learning (IL). However, these popular models for solving\nMDPs are neither thoroughly tested nor rigorously reliable.\nWe present MDPFuzzer, the first blackbox fuzz testing framework for models\nsolving MDPs. MDPFuzzer forms testing oracles by checking whether the target\nmodel enters abnormal and dangerous states. During fuzzing, MDPFuzzer decides\nwhich mutated state to retain by measuring if it can reduce cumulative rewards\nor form a new state sequence. We design efficient techniques to quantify the\n\"freshness\" of a state sequence using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and\ndynamic expectation-maximization (DynEM).

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation holds the promise of being able to infer user\npreference from the history information. Existing methods mostly assume\ncoherent user preference in the history information, and deploy a unified model\nto predict the next behavior. However, user preferences are naturally diverse,\nand different users may enjoy their own personalities, which makes the history\ninformation mixed of heterogeneous user preferences. Inspired by this practical\nconsideration, in this paper, we proposed a novel sequential recommender model\nby disentangling different user preferences. The main building block of our\nidea is a behavior allocator, which determines how many sub-sequences the\nhistory information should be decomposed into, and how to allocate each item\ninto these sub-sequences. In particular, we regard the disentanglement of user\npreference as a Markov decision process, and design a reinforcement learning\nmethod to implement the behavior allocator. The reward in our model is designed\nto assign the target item to the nearest sub-sequence, and simultaneously\nencourage orthogonality between the generated sub-sequences. To make the\ndisentangled sub-sequences not too sparse, we introduce a curriculum reward,\nwhich adaptively penalizes the action of creating a new sub-sequence.

    "abstract": "Model-based reinforcement learning methods achieve significant sample\nefficiency in many tasks, but their performance is often limited by the\nexistence of the model error. To reduce the model error, previous works use a\nsingle well-designed network to fit the entire environment dynamics, which\ntreats the environment dynamics as a black box. However, these methods lack to\nconsider the environmental decomposed property that the dynamics may contain\nmultiple sub-dynamics, which can be modeled separately, allowing us to\nconstruct the world model more accurately. In this paper, we propose the\nEnvironment Dynamics Decomposition (ED2), a novel world model construction\nframework that models the environment in a decomposing manner. ED2 contains two\nkey components: sub-dynamics discovery (SD2) and dynamics decomposition\nprediction (D2P). SD2 discovers the sub-dynamics in an environment and then D2P\nconstructs the decomposed world model following the sub-dynamics. ED2 can be\neasily combined with existing MBRL algorithms and empirical results show that\nED2 significantly reduces the model error and boosts the performance of the\nstate-of-the-art MBRL algorithms on various tasks.",

    "abstract": "Model compression can significantly reduce sizes of deep neural network (DNN)\nmodels so that large, sophisticated models after compression can be deployed on\nresource-limited mobile and IoT devices. However, model compression often\nintroduces deviated behaviors into a compressed model: the original and\ncompressed models output different prediction results for the same input.\nHence, it is critical to warn developers and help them comprehensively evaluate\npossible consequences of such behaviors before deployment. To this end, we\npropose TriggerFinder, a novel, effective and efficient testing approach to\nautomatically identifying inputs to trigger deviated behaviors in compressed\nmodels. Given an input i as a seed, TriggerFinder iteratively applies a series\nof mutation operations to change i until the resulting input triggers a\ndeviated behavior.\nHowever, compressed models usually hide their architecture and gradient\ninformation; without such internal information as guidance, it becomes\ndifficult to effectively and efficiently trigger deviated behaviors. To tackle\nthis challenge, we propose a novel fitness function to determine the mutated\ninput that is closer to the inputs that can trigger the deviated predictions.\nFurthermore, TriggerFinder models this search problem as a Markov Chain process\nand leverages the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm to guide the selection of\nmutation operators.\nWe evaluated TriggerFinder on 18 compressed models with two datasets. The\nexperiment results demonstrate that TriggerFinder can successfully find\ntriggering inputs for all seed inputs while the baseline fails in certain\ncases. As for efficiency, TriggerFinder is 5.2x-115.8x as fast as the\nbaselines. Furthermore, the queries required by TriggerFinder to find one\ntriggering input is only 51.8x-535.6x as small as the baseline.",

Identification in existing writer-id\nstudies requires a complete document or text, limiting the scalability and\nflexibility of writer-id in realistic applications.

Unlike text-\\ document-based\nwriter-id which has rich context for identification, there are much fewer clues\nto recognize an author from only a few single letters. A main challenge is that\na person often writes a letter in different styles from time to time. We refer\nto this problem as the variance of online writing styles (Var-O-Styles). We\naddress the Var-O-Styles in a capture-normalize-aggregate fashion: Firstly, we\nextract different features of a letter trajectory by a carefully designed\nmulti-branch encoder, in an attempt to capture different online writing styles.\nThen we convert all these style features to a reference style feature domain by\na novel normalization layer.

However, exiting SSL\nparadigms mostly assume in-distribution (i.e., category-aligned) unlabeled\ndata, which hinders their effectiveness when re-proposed on FGVC. In this\npaper, we put forward a novel design specifically aimed at making\nout-of-distribution data work for semi-supervised FGVC, i.e., to \"clue them\nin\". We work off an important assumption that all fine-grained categories\nnaturally follow a hierarchical structure (e.g., the phylogenetic tree of\n\"Aves\" that covers all bird species). It follows that, instead of operating on\nindividual samples, we can instead predict sample relations within this tree\nstructure as the optimization goal of SSL. Beyond this, we further introduced\ntwo strategies uniquely brought by these tree structures to achieve\ninter-sample consistency regularization and reliable pseudo-relation.

Since\nimages from different frames with diverse motion and scene, accurately aligning\nmultiple frames and effectively fusing different frames has always been the key\nresearch work of VSR tasks. To utilize rich complementary information of\nneighboring frames, in this paper, we propose a multi-stage VSR deep\narchitecture, dubbed as PP-MSVSR, with local fusion module, auxiliary loss and\nre-align module to refine the enhanced result progressively. Specifically, in\norder to strengthen the fusion of features across frames in feature\npropagation, a local fusion module is designed in stage-1 to perform local\nfeature fusion before feature propagation. Moreover, we introduce an auxiliary\nloss in stage-2 to make the features obtained by the propagation module reserve\nmore correlated information connected to the HR space, and introduce a re-align\nmodule in stage-3 to make full use of the feature information of the previous\nstage. Extensive experiments substantiate that PP-MSVSR achieves a promising\nperformance of Vid4 datasets, which achieves a PSNR of 28.13dB with only 1.45M\nparameters.

The data-hungry training processes of deep learning models\ndemand large, resource expensive, annotated datasets and partly replaced\nknowledge-driven approaches, so that model behaviour and the final prediction\nprocess became a black box. The proposed SyntEO approach enables Earth\nobservation researchers to automatically generate large deep learning ready\ndatasets and thus free up otherwise occupied resources. SyntEO does this by\nincluding expert knowledge in the data generation process in a highly\nstructured manner. In this way, fully controllable experiment environments are\nset up, which support insights in the model training. Thus, SyntEO makes the\nlearning process approachable and model behaviour interpretable, an important\ncornerstone for explainable machine learning. We demonstrate the SyntEO\napproach by predicting offshore wind farms in Sentinel-1 images on two of the\nworlds largest offshore wind energy production sites. The largest generated\ndataset has 90,000 training examples. A basic convolutional neural network for\nobject detection, that is only trained on this synthetic data, confidently\ndetects offshore wind farms by minimising false detections in challenging\nenvironments. In addition, four sequential datasets are generated,\ndemonstrating how the SyntEO approach can precisely define the dataset\nstructure and influence the training process.

Recently, efforts have been afoot towards zero-shot\nquantization that does not require original unlabelled training samples of a\ngiven task. These best-published works heavily rely on the learned batch\nnormalization (BN) parameters to infer the range of the activations for\nquantization. In particular, these methods are built upon either empirical\nestimation framework or the data distillation approach, for computing the range\nof the activations. However, the performance of such schemes severely degrades\nwhen presented with a network that does not accommodate BN layers.

We have\nutilized the data distillation approach and leveraged only the pre-trained\nweights of the model to estimate enriched data for range calibration of the\nactivations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that utilizes\nthe distribution of the pretrained weights to assist the process of zero-shot\nquantization. The proposed scheme has significantly outperformed the existing\nzero-shot works, e.g., an improvement of ~ 33% in classification accuracy for\nMobileNetV2 and several other models that are w & w/o BN layers, for a variety\nof tasks.

Optimal measurement scheduling is an\nNP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. The so-called sequential greedy\n(SG) algorithm is a popular suboptimal polynomial-time solution for this\nproblem.

    "abstract": "The ability to successfully grasp objects is crucial in robotics, as it\nenables several interactive downstream applications. To this end, most\napproaches either compute the full 6D pose for the object of interest or learn\nto predict a set of grasping points. While the former approaches do not scale\nwell to multiple object instances or classes yet, the latter require large\nannotated datasets and are hampered by their poor generalization capabilities\nto new geometries. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose to teach a robot\nhow to grasp an object with a simple and short human demonstration. Hence, our\napproach neither requires many annotated images nor is it restricted to a\nspecific geometry. We first present a small sequence of RGB-D images displaying\na human-object interaction. This sequence is then leveraged to build associated\nhand and object meshes that represent the depicted interaction. Subsequently,\nwe complete missing parts of the reconstructed object shape and estimate the\nrelative transformation between the reconstruction and the visible object in\nthe scene. Finally, we transfer the a-priori knowledge from the relative pose\nbetween object and human hand with the estimate of the current object pose in\nthe scene into necessary grasping instructions for the robot. Exhaustive\nevaluations with Toyota's Human Support Robot (HSR) in real and synthetic\nenvironments demonstrate the applicability of our proposed methodology and its\nadvantage in comparison to previous approaches.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel no-reference quality assessment metric, the image\ntransferred point cloud quality assessment (IT-PCQA), for 3D point clouds. For\nquality assessment, deep neural network (DNN) has shown compelling performance\non no-reference metric design. However, the most challenging issue for\nno-reference PCQA is that we lack large-scale subjective databases to drive\nrobust networks. Our motivation is that the human visual system (HVS) is the\ndecision-maker regardless of the type of media for quality assessment.\nLeveraging the rich subjective scores of the natural images, we can quest the\nevaluation criteria of human perception via DNN and transfer the capability of\nprediction to 3D point clouds. In particular, we treat natural images as the\nsource domain and point clouds as the target domain, and infer point cloud\nquality via unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation. To extract effective\nlatent features and minimize the domain discrepancy, we propose a hierarchical\nfeature encoder and a conditional-discriminative network. Considering that the\nultimate purpose is regressing objective score, we introduce a novel\nconditional cross entropy loss in the conditional-discriminative network to\npenalize the negative samples which hinder the convergence of the quality\nregression network. Experimental results show that the proposed method can\nachieve higher performance than traditional no-reference metrics, even\ncomparable results with full-reference metrics. The proposed method also\nsuggests the feasibility of assessing the quality of specific media content\nwithout the expensive and cumbersome subjective evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Error propagation is a general but crucial problem in online semi-supervised\nvideo object segmentation. We aim to suppress error propagation through a\ncorrection mechanism with high reliability. The key insight is to disentangle\nthe correction from the conventional mask propagation process with reliable\ncues. We introduce two modulators, propagation and correction modulators, to\nseparately perform channel-wise re-calibration on the target frame embeddings\naccording to local temporal correlations and reliable references respectively.\nSpecifically, we assemble the modulators with a cascaded propagation-correction\nscheme. This avoids overriding the effects of the reliable correction modulator\nby the propagation modulator. Although the reference frame with the ground\ntruth label provides reliable cues, it could be very different from the target\nframe and introduce uncertain or incomplete correlations. We augment the\nreference cues by supplementing reliable feature patches to a maintained pool,\nthus offering more comprehensive and expressive object representations to the\nmodulators. In addition, a reliability filter is designed to retrieve reliable\npatches and pass them in subsequent frames. Our model achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on YouTube-VOS18/19 and DAVIS17-Val/Test benchmarks.

    "abstract": "We consider online no-regret learning in unknown games with bandit feedback,\nwhere each agent only observes its reward at each time -- determined by all\nplayers' current joint action -- rather than its gradient. We focus on the\nclass of smooth and strongly monotone games and study optimal no-regret\nlearning therein. Leveraging self-concordant barrier functions, we first\nconstruct an online bandit convex optimization algorithm and show that it\nachieves the single-agent optimal regret of $\\tilde{\\Theta}(\\sqrt{T})$ under\nsmooth and strongly-concave payoff functions. We then show that if each agent\napplies this no-regret learning algorithm in strongly monotone games, the joint\naction converges in \\textit{last iterate} to the unique Nash equilibrium at a\nrate of $\\tilde{\\Theta}(1/\\sqrt{T})$. Prior to our work, the best-know\nconvergence rate in the same class of games is $O(1/T^{1/3})$ (achieved by a\ndifferent algorithm), thus leaving open the problem of optimal no-regret\nlearning algorithms (since the known lower bound is $\\Omega(1/\\sqrt{T})$). Our\nresults thus settle this open problem and contribute to the broad landscape of\nbandit game-theoretical learning by identifying the first doubly optimal bandit\nlearning algorithm, in that it achieves (up to log factors) both optimal regret\nin the single-agent learning and optimal last-iterate convergence rate in the\nmulti-agent learning.

    "abstract": "Data augmentation (DA) has been widely investigated to facilitate model\noptimization in many tasks. However, in most cases, data augmentation is\nrandomly performed for each training sample with a certain probability, which\nmight incur content destruction and visual ambiguities. To eliminate this, in\nthis paper, we propose an effective approach, dubbed SelectAugment, to select\nsamples to be augmented in a deterministic and online manner based on the\nsample contents and the network training status. Specifically, in each batch,\nwe first determine the augmentation ratio, and then decide whether to augment\neach training sample under this ratio. We model this process as a two-step\nMarkov decision process and adopt Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) to\nlearn the augmentation policy. In this way, the negative effects of the\nrandomness in selecting samples to augment can be effectively alleviated and\nthe effectiveness of DA is improved. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nproposed SelectAugment can be adapted upon numerous commonly used DA methods,\ne.g., Mixup, Cutmix, AutoAugment, etc, and improve their performance on\nmultiple benchmark datasets of image classification and fine-grained image\nrecognition.",

    "abstract": "In a crowdsourcing contest, a requester holding a task posts it to a crowd.\nPeople in the crowd then compete with each other to win the rewards. Although\nin real life, a crowd is usually networked and people influence each other via\nsocial ties, existing crowdsourcing contest theories do not aim to answer how\ninterpersonal relationships influence peoples' incentives and behaviors, and\nthereby affect the crowdsourcing performance. In this work, we novelly take\npeoples' social ties as a key factor in the modeling and designing of agents'\nincentives for crowdsourcing contests. We then establish a new contest\nmechanism by which the requester can impel agents to invite their neighbours to\ncontribute to the task. The mechanism has a simple rule and is very easy for\nagents to play. According to our equilibrium analysis, in the Bayesian Nash\nequilibrium agents' behaviors show a vast diversity, capturing that besides the\nintrinsic ability, the social ties among agents also play a central role for\ndecision-making. After that, we design an effective algorithm to automatically\ncompute the Bayesian Nash equilibrium of the invitation crowdsourcing contest\nand further adapt it to large graphs. Both theoretical and empirical results\nshow that, the invitation crowdsourcing contest can substantially enlarge the\nnumber of contributors, whereby the requester can obtain significantly better\nsolutions without a large advertisement expenditure.",

    "abstract": "Despite tremendous improvements in state-of-the-art object detectors,\naddressing object detection in the night-time has been studied only sparsely,\nthat too, via non-uniform evaluation protocols among the limited available\npapers. In addition to the lack of methods to address this problem, there was\nalso a lack of an adequately large benchmark dataset to study night-time object\ndetection. Recently, the large scale BDD100K was introduced, which, in our\nopinion, should be chosen as the benchmark, to kickstart research in this area.\nNow, coming to the methods, existing approaches (limited in number), are mainly\neither generative image translation based, or image enhancement/ illumination\nbased, neither of which is natural, conforming to how humans see objects in the\nnight time (by focusing on object contours). In this paper, we bridge these 3\ngaps: 1. Lack of an uniform evaluation protocol (using a single-stage detector,\ndue to its efficacy, and efficiency), 2. Choice of dataset for benchmarking\nnight-time object detection, and 3. A novel method to address the limitations\nof current alternatives. Our method leverages a Contrastive Learning based\nfeature extractor, borrowing information from the frequency domain via Fourier\ntransformation, and trained in a continual learning based fashion. The learned\nfeatures when used for object detection (after fine-tuning the classification\nand regression layers), help achieve a new state-of-the-art empirical\nperformance, comfortably outperforming an extensive number of competitors.",

With the increasing\navailability of large volumes of data, a number of neural architectures have\nbeen proposed for this problem. In particular, Transformer-based methods\nachieve state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmarks. However, these\nmethods require a large number of parameters to be learned, which imposes high\nmemory requirements on the computational resources for training such models.\nTo address this problem, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Temporal\nConvolutional Network (BiTCN), which requires an order of magnitude less\nparameters than a common Transformer-based approach. Our model combines two\nTemporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs): the first network encodes future\ncovariates of the time series, whereas the second network encodes past\nobservations and covariates. We jointly estimate the parameters of an output\ndistribution via these two networks.\nExperiments on four real-world datasets show that our method performs on par\nwith four state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting methods, including a\nTransformer-based approach and WaveNet, on two point metrics (sMAPE, NRMSE) as\nwell as on a set of range metrics (quantile loss percentiles) in the majority\nof cases.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address a crucial problem in fashion e-commerce (with\nrespect to customer experience, as well as revenue): color variants\nidentification, i.e., identifying fashion products that match exactly in their\ndesign (or style), but only to differ in their color. We propose a generic\nframework, that leverages deep visual Representation Learning at its heart, to\naddress this problem for our fashion e-commerce platform. Our framework could\nbe trained with supervisory signals in the form of triplets, that are obtained\nmanually. However, it is infeasible to obtain manual annotations for the entire\nhuge collection of data usually present in fashion e-commerce platforms, such\nas ours, while capturing all the difficult corner cases. But, to our rescue,\ninterestingly we observed that this crucial problem in fashion e-commerce could\nalso be solved by simple color jitter based image augmentation, that recently\nbecame widely popular in the contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)\nliterature, that seeks to learn visual representations without using manual\nlabels. This naturally led to a question in our mind: Could we leverage SSL in\nour use-case, and still obtain comparable performance to our supervised\nframework? The answer is, Yes! because, color variant fashion objects are\nnothing but manifestations of a style, in different colors, and a model trained\nto be invariant to the color (with, or without supervision), should be able to\nrecognize this! This is what the paper further demonstrates, both\nqualitatively, and quantitatively, while evaluating a couple of\nstate-of-the-art SSL techniques, and also proposing a novel method.",

This proposed method boosts the learning\nefficiency as well as the generalization capability.

    "abstract": "In federated learning (FL), data does not leave personal devices when they\nare jointly training a machine learning model. Instead, these devices share\ngradients with a central party (e.g., a company). Because data never \"leaves\"\npersonal devices, FL is presented as privacy-preserving. Yet, recently it was\nshown that this protection is but a thin facade, as even a passive attacker\nobserving gradients can reconstruct data of individual users. In this paper, we\nargue that prior work still largely underestimates the vulnerability of FL.\nThis is because prior efforts exclusively consider passive attackers that are\nhonest-but-curious. Instead, we introduce an active and dishonest attacker\nacting as the central party, who is able to modify the shared model's weights\nbefore users compute model gradients. We call the modified weights \"trap\nweights\". Our active attacker is able to recover user data perfectly and at\nnear zero costs: the attack requires no complex optimization objectives.\nInstead, it exploits inherent data leakage from model gradients and amplifies\nthis effect by maliciously altering the weights of the shared model. These\nspecificities enable our attack to scale to models trained with large\nmini-batches of data. Where attackers from prior work require hours to recover\na single data point, our method needs milliseconds to capture the full\nmini-batch of data from both fully-connected and convolutional deep neural\nnetworks. Finally, we consider mitigations. We observe that current\nimplementations of differential privacy (DP) in FL are flawed, as they\nexplicitly trust the central party with the crucial task of adding DP noise,\nand thus provide no protection against a malicious central party. We also\nconsider other defenses and explain why they are similarly inadequate. A\nsignificant redesign of FL is required for it to provide any meaningful form of\ndata privacy to users.",

    "abstract": "Increasing deployment of photovoltaic (PV) plants requires methods for\nautomatic detection of faulty PV modules in modalities, such as infrared (IR)\nimages. Recently, deep learning has become popular for this. However, related\nworks typically sample train and test data from the same distribution ignoring\nthe presence of domain shift between data of different PV plants. Instead, we\nframe fault detection as more realistic unsupervised domain adaptation problem\nwhere we train on labelled data of one source PV plant and make predictions on\nanother target plant. We train a ResNet-34 convolutional neural network with a\nsupervised contrastive loss, on top of which we employ a k-nearest neighbor\nclassifier to detect anomalies. Our method achieves a satisfactory area under\nthe receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 73.3 % to 96.6 % on nine\ncombinations of four source and target datasets with 2.92 million IR images of\nwhich 8.5 % are anomalous. It even outperforms a binary cross-entropy\nclassifier in some cases. With a fixed decision threshold this results in 79.4\n% and 77.1 % correctly classified normal and anomalous images, respectively.\nMost misclassified anomalies are of low severity, such as hot diodes and small\nhot spots. Our method is insensitive to hyperparameter settings, converges\nquickly and reliably detects unknown types of anomalies making it well suited\nfor practice. Possible uses are in automatic PV plant inspection systems or to\nstreamline manual labelling of IR datasets by filtering out normal images.\nFurthermore, our work serves the community with a more realistic view on PV\nmodule fault detection using unsupervised domain adaptation to develop more\nperformant methods with favorable generalization capabilities.",

Here, we challenge the\ncurrent trend in the continual learning literature to experiment mainly on\nclass-incremental scenarios, where classes present in one experience are never\nrevisited. We posit that an excessive focus on this setting may be limiting for\nfuture research on continual learning, since class-incremental scenarios\nartificially exacerbate catastrophic forgetting, at the expense of other\nimportant objectives like forward transfer and computational efficiency. In\nmany real-world environments, in fact, repetition of previously encountered\nconcepts occurs naturally and contributes to softening the disruption of\nprevious knowledge. We advocate for a more in-depth study of alternative\ncontinual learning scenarios, in which repetition is integrated by design in\nthe stream of incoming information.

This problem has crucial applications in\nvarious contexts including biology, medicine, and social science, such as\ncontrolling the propagation of viruses or rumours in real world networks. While\nexisting methods mostly employ local neighbourhood features which heavily rely\non the network structure and disregard the underlying diffusion dynamics, in\nthis work we present a randomized sampling algorithm that not only takes into\naccount the local and global structural features of the network but also\nconsiders the underlying diffusion dynamics and its parameters. The main idea\nis to compute the influentiality of a node through reachability from that node\nin a set of random graphs. We use a hyper-graph to capture the reachability\nfrom nodes in the original network, and theoretically argue that the hypergraph\ncan be used to approximate the theoretical influentiality of nodes in the\noriginal graph with a factor of 1 - epsilon. The performance of the proposed\nmodel is also evaluated empirically by measuring the correlation between the\nranking generated by the proposed method and the ground truth ranking. Our\nresults show that the proposed method substantially outperforms state of the\nart methods and achieves the highest correlation with the ground-truth ranking,\nwhile the generated ranking has a high level of uniqueness and uniformity.\nTheoretical and practical analysis of the running time of the algorithm also\nconfirms that the proposed method maintains a competitive running time in\ncomparison to the state of the art methods.",

From a technical point of view, an encrypted\ncontroller is a modified control algorithm that is capable of computing\nencrypted control actions based on encrypted system outputs. Unsurprisingly,\nencrypted implementations of controllers using, e.g., homomorphic cryptosystems\nentail new design challenges. For instance, in order to avoid overflow or high\ncomputational loads, only a finite number of operations should be carried out\non encrypted data. Clearly, this guideline is hard to satisfy for dynamic\ncontrollers due to their recursive nature. To enable an unlimited operating\ntime, existing implementations thus rely on external refreshments of the\ncontroller state, internal refreshments using bootstrapping, or recurring\ncontroller resets.\nWe show in this paper that simple FIR filter-based controllers allow\novercoming many drawbacks of the existing approaches.

We describe the\nimplementation of the CSX compiler and the CSX programming environment (IDE),\nwhich supports well-formedness checking, inhabitance checking, and interactive\nconfiguration space exploration. We evaluate CSX by modelling two realistic\nfinishers. Benchmarks show that CSX has practical performance (<1s) for several\nscenarios of configuration space exploration.",

    "abstract": "Noisy labels damage the performance of deep networks. For robust learning, a\nprominent two-stage pipeline alternates between eliminating possible incorrect\nlabels and semi-supervised training. However, discarding part of observed\nlabels could result in a loss of information, especially when the corruption is\nnot completely random, e.g., class-dependent or instance-dependent. Moreover,\nfrom the training dynamics of a representative two-stage method DivideMix, we\nidentify the domination of confirmation bias: Pseudo-labels fail to correct a\nconsiderable amount of noisy labels and consequently, the errors accumulate. To\nsufficiently exploit information from observed labels and mitigate wrong\ncorrections, we propose Robust Label Refurbishment (Robust LR)-a new hybrid\nmethod that integrates pseudo-labeling and confidence estimation techniques to\nrefurbish noisy labels. We show that our method successfully alleviates the\ndamage of both label noise and confirmation bias. As a result, it achieves\nstate-of-the-art results across datasets and noise types.

    "abstract": "Tabular data are ubiquitous in real world applications. Although many\ncommonly-used neural components (e.g., convolution) and extensible neural\nnetworks (e.g., ResNet) have been developed by the machine learning community,\nfew of them were effective for tabular data and few designs were adequately\ntailored for tabular data structures. In this paper, we propose a novel and\nflexible neural component for tabular data, called Abstract Layer (AbstLay),\nwhich learns to explicitly group correlative input features and generate\nhigher-level features for semantics abstraction. Also, we design a structure\nre-parameterization method to compress AbstLay, thus reducing the computational\ncomplexity by a clear margin in the reference phase. A special basic block is\nbuilt using AbstLays, and we construct a family of Deep Abstract Networks\n(DANets) for tabular data classification and regression by stacking such\nblocks. In DANets, a special shortcut path is introduced to fetch information\nfrom raw tabular features, assisting feature interactions across different\nlevels. Comprehensive experiments on seven real-world tabular datasets show\nthat our AbstLay and DANets are effective for tabular data classification and\nregression, and the computational complexity is superior to competitive\nmethods. Besides, we evaluate the performance gains of DANet as it goes deep,\nverifying the extendibility of our method. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/WhatAShot/DANet.",

    "abstract": "Currently, BIO-based and tuple-based approaches perform quite well on the\nspan-based semantic role labeling (SRL) task. However, the BIO-based approach\nusually needs to encode a sentence once for each predicate when predicting its\narguments, and the tuple-based approach has to deal with a huge search space of\n$O(n^3)$, greatly reducing the training and inference efficiency. The parsing\nspeed is less than 50 sentences per second. Moreover, both BIO-based and\ntuple-based approaches usually consider only local structural information when\nmaking predictions. This paper proposes to cast end-to-end span-based SRL as a\ngraph parsing task. Based on a novel graph representation schema, we present a\nfast and accurate SRL parser on the shoulder of recent works on high-order\nsemantic dependency graph parsing. Moreover, we propose a constrained Viterbi\nprocedure to ensure the legality of the output graph. Experiments on English\nCoNLL05 and CoNLL12 datasets show that our model achieves new state-of-the-art\nresults under both settings of without and with pre-trained language models,\nand can parse over 600 sentences per second.",

    "title": "Towards More Robust Natural Language Understanding",
    "abstract": "Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a branch of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) that uses intelligent computer software to understand texts\nthat encode human knowledge. Recent years have witnessed notable progress\nacross various NLU tasks with deep learning techniques, especially with\npretrained language models. Besides proposing more advanced model\narchitectures, constructing more reliable and trustworthy datasets also plays a\nhuge role in improving NLU systems, without which it would be impossible to\ntrain a decent NLU model. It's worth noting that the human ability of\nunderstanding natural language is flexible and robust. On the contrary, most of\nexisting NLU systems fail to achieve desirable performance on out-of-domain\ndata or struggle on handling challenging items (e.g., inherently ambiguous\nitems, adversarial items) in the real world. Therefore, in order to have NLU\nmodels understand human language more effectively, it is expected to prioritize\nthe study on robust natural language understanding. In this thesis, we deem\nthat NLU systems are consisting of two components: NLU models and NLU datasets.\nAs such, we argue that, to achieve robust NLU, the model architecture/training\nand the dataset are equally important. Specifically, we will focus on three NLU\ntasks to illustrate the robustness problem in different NLU tasks and our\ncontributions (i.e., novel models and new datasets) to help achieve more robust\nnatural language understanding. Moving forward, the ultimate goal for robust\nnatural language understanding is to build NLU models which can behave humanly.\nThat is, it's expected that robust NLU systems are capable to transfer the\nknowledge from training corpus to unseen documents more reliably and survive\nwhen encountering challenging items even if the system doesn't know a priori of\nusers' inputs.",

    "abstract": "Idioms are special fixed phrases usually derived from stories. They are\ncommonly used in casual conversations and literary writings. Their meanings are\nusually highly non-compositional. The idiom cloze task is a challenge problem\nin Natural Language Processing (NLP) research problem. Previous approaches to\nthis task are built on sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models and achieved\nreasonably well performance on existing datasets. However, they fall short in\nunderstanding the highly non-compositional meaning of idiomatic expressions.\nThey also do not consider both the local and global context at the same time.\nIn this paper, we proposed a BERT-based embedding Seq2Seq model that encodes\nidiomatic expressions and considers them in both global and local context. Our\nmodel uses XLNET as the encoder and RoBERTa for choosing the most probable\nidiom for a given context.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the multi-task sentiment classification problem in\nthe continual learning setting, i.e., a model is sequentially trained to\nclassifier the sentiment of reviews of products in a particular category. The\nuse of common sentiment words in reviews of different product categories leads\nto large cross-task similarity, which differentiates it from continual learning\nin other domains. This knowledge sharing nature renders forgetting reduction\nfocused approaches less effective for the problem under consideration. Unlike\nexisting approaches, where task-specific masks are learned with specifically\npresumed training objectives, we propose an approach called Task-aware Dropout\n(TaskDrop) to generate masks in a random way. While the standard dropout\ngenerates and applies random masks for each training instance per epoch for\neffective regularization, TaskDrop applies random masking for task-wise\ncapacity allocation and reuse. We conducted experimental studies on three\nmulti-task review datasets and made comparison to various baselines and\nstate-of-the-art approaches. Our empirical results show that regardless of\nsimplicity, TaskDrop overall achieved competitive performances for all the\nthree datasets, especially after relative long term learning. This demonstrates\nthat the proposed random capacity allocation mechanism works well for continual\nsentiment classification.",

Inspired\nby these works, we propose a hierarchical framework that integrates online\nlearning for the Mb-trajectory optimization with off-policy methods for the\nMf-RL. In particular, two loops are proposed, where the Dynamic Mirror Descent\nbased Model Predictive Control (DMD-MPC) is used as the inner loop Mb-RL to\nobtain an optimal sequence of actions. These actions are in turn used to\nsignificantly accelerate the outer loop Mf-RL. We show that our formulation is\ngeneric for a broad class of MPC-based policies and objectives, and includes\nsome of the well-known Mb-Mf approaches. We finally introduce a new algorithm:\nMirror-Descent Model Predictive RL (M-DeMoRL), which uses Cross-Entropy Method\n(CEM) with elite fractions for the inner loop. Our experiments show faster\nconvergence of the proposed hierarchical approach on benchmark MuJoCo tasks.

In the case of robots, we can not afford to spend that much\ntime on making it to learn how to grasp objects effectively. Therefore, in the\npresent research we propose an efficient learning architecture based on VQVAE\nso that robots can be taught with sufficient data corresponding to correct\ngrasping. However, getting sufficient labelled data is extremely difficult in\nthe robot grasping domain. To help solve this problem, a semi-supervised\nlearning based model which has much more generalization capability even with\nlimited labelled data set, has been investigated.

In the descriptive line\nof works, where researchers have tried to analyse rumours using NLP approaches,\nthere isnt much emphasis on psycho-linguistics analyses of social media text.\nThese kinds of analyses on rumour case studies are vital for drawing meaningful\nconclusions to mitigate misinformation. For our analysis, we explored the\nPHEME9 rumour dataset (consisting of 9 events), including source tweets (both\nrumour and non-rumour categories) and response tweets. We compared the rumour\nand nonrumour source tweets and then their corresponding reply (response)\ntweets to understand how they differ linguistically for every incident.\nFurthermore, we also evaluated if these features can be used for classifying\nrumour vs. non-rumour tweets through machine learning models. To this end, we\nemployed various classical and ensemble-based approaches. To filter out the\nhighly discriminative psycholinguistic features, we explored the SHAP AI\nExplainability tool.

We\npropose a wildfire rapid response system that optimizes the number and relative\npositions of drones to achieve full coverage of the whole wildfire area.\nTrained on the data from historical wildfire events, our model evaluates the\npossibility of wildfires at different scales and accordingly allocates the\nresources. It adopts plane geometry to deploy drones while balancing the\ncapability and safety with inequality constrained nonlinear programming. The\nmethod can flexibly adapt to different terrains and the dynamic extension of\nthe wildfire area. Lastly, the operation cost under extreme wildfire\ncircumstances can be assessed upon the completion of the deployment. We applied\nour model to the wildfire data collected from eastern Victoria, Australia, and\ndemonstrated its great potential in the real world.",

    "abstract": "Aspect-based sentiment classification aims to predict the sentiment polarity\nof a specific aspect in a sentence. However, most existing methods attempt to\nconstruct dependency relations into a homogeneous dependency graph with the\nsparsity and ambiguity, which cannot cover the comprehensive contextualized\nfeatures of short texts or consider any additional node types or semantic\nrelation information. To solve those issues, we present a sentiment analysis\nmodel named Isomer, which performs a dual-channel attention on heterogeneous\ndependency graphs incorporating external knowledge, to effectively integrate\nother additional information. Specifically, a transfer-enhanced dual-channel\nheterogeneous dependency attention network is devised in Isomer to model short\ntexts using heterogeneous dependency graphs. These heterogeneous dependency\ngraphs not only consider different types of information but also incorporate\nexternal knowledge. Experiments studies show that our model outperforms recent\nmodels on benchmark datasets.

However, the agent's behavior is usually\ndifficult to interpret due to the introduction of black-box function, making it\ndifficult to acquire the trust of users. Although there have been some\ninteresting interpretation methods for vision-based RL, most of them cannot\nuncover temporal causal information, raising questions about their reliability.\nTo address this problem, we present a temporal-spatial causal interpretation\n(TSCI) model to understand the agent's long-term behavior, which is essential\nfor sequential decision-making. TSCI model builds on the formulation of\ntemporal causality, which reflects the temporal causal relations between\nsequential observations and decisions of RL agent. Then a separate causal\ndiscovery network is employed to identify temporal-spatial causal features,\nwhich are constrained to satisfy the temporal causality. TSCI model is\napplicable to recurrent agents and can be used to discover causal features with\nhigh efficiency once trained. The empirical results show that TSCI model can\nproduce high-resolution and sharp attention masks to highlight task-relevant\ntemporal-spatial information that constitutes most evidence about how\nvision-based RL agents make sequential decisions.

Also, the word co-occurrences guided semantic\nlearning of pre-training models can be largely augmented by entity-level\nassociation knowledge. But meanwhile, by doing so there is a risk of\nintroducing noise due to the lack of groundtruth word-level alignment. To\naddress the above issues, we provide a generalized domain-oriented approach,\nwhich leverages auxiliary domain knowledge to improve the existing pre-training\nframework from two aspects. First, to preserve phrase knowledge effectively, we\nbuild a domain phrase pool as auxiliary training tool, meanwhile we introduce\nAdaptive Hybrid Masked Model to incorporate such knowledge. It integrates two\nlearning modes, word learning and phrase learning, and allows them to switch\nbetween each other. Second, we introduce Cross Entity Alignment to leverage\nentity association as weak supervision to augment the semantic learning of\npre-trained models. To alleviate the potential noise in this process, we\nintroduce an interpretable Optimal Transport based approach to guide alignment\nlearning.

    "abstract": "Depth and ego-motion estimations are essential for the localization and\nnavigation of autonomous robots and autonomous driving. Recent studies make it\npossible to learn the per-pixel depth and ego-motion from the unlabeled\nmonocular video. A novel unsupervised training framework is proposed with 3D\nhierarchical refinement and augmentation using explicit 3D geometry. In this\nframework, the depth and pose estimations are hierarchically and mutually\ncoupled to refine the estimated pose layer by layer. The intermediate view\nimage is proposed and synthesized by warping the pixels in an image with the\nestimated depth and coarse pose. Then, the residual pose transformation can be\nestimated from the new view image and the image of the adjacent frame to refine\nthe coarse pose. The iterative refinement is implemented in a differentiable\nmanner in this paper, making the whole framework optimized uniformly.\nMeanwhile, a new image augmentation method is proposed for the pose estimation\nby synthesizing a new view image, which creatively augments the pose in 3D\nspace but gets a new augmented 2D image. The experiments on KITTI demonstrate\nthat our depth estimation achieves state-of-the-art performance and even\nsurpasses recent approaches that utilize other auxiliary tasks. Our visual\nodometry outperforms all recent unsupervised monocular learning-based methods\nand achieves competitive performance to the geometry-based method, ORB-SLAM2\nwith back-end optimization.",

    "abstract": "With more than 4 billion devices produced in 2020, Bluetooth and Bluetooth\nLow Energy (BLE) have become the backbone of the Internet of Things. Bluetooth\nand BLE mitigate interference in the crowded 2.4 GHz band via Adaptive\nFrequency Hopping (AFH), spreading communication over the entire spectrum, and\nfurther allows the exclusion of interfered channels. However, exclusion is\nchallenging in dynamic environments or with user mobility: as a user moves\naround, interference affects new channels, forcing AFH to deprive itself of new\nfrequencies, while some other excluded channels are now free of losses but\nremain excluded. Channel re-inclusion is a primordial, yet often left out,\naspect of AFH, as it is non-trivial to assess the new situation of excluded\nfrequencies. We present eAFH, a mechanism for channel exclusion and inclusion.\neAFH introduces informed exploration to AFH: using only past measurements, eAFH\nassesses which frequencies we are most likely to benefit from re-including in\nthe hopping sequence. As a result, eAFH adapts in dynamic scenarios where\ninterference varies over time. We show that eAFH achieves 98-99.5% link-layer\nreliability in the presence of dynamic Wifi interference with 1% control\noverhead and 40% higher channel diversity than state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "We propose a method to interactively control the animation of fluid elements\nin still images to generate cinemagraphs. Specifically, we focus on the\nanimation of fluid elements like water, smoke, fire, which have the properties\nof repeating textures and continuous fluid motion. Taking inspiration from\nprior works, we represent the motion of such fluid elements in the image in the\nform of a constant 2D optical flow map. To this end, we allow the user to\nprovide any number of arrow directions and their associated speeds along with a\nmask of the regions the user wants to animate. The user-provided input arrow\ndirections, their corresponding speed values, and the mask are then converted\ninto a dense flow map representing a constant optical flow map (FD). We observe\nthat FD, obtained using simple exponential operations can closely approximate\nthe plausible motion of elements in the image. We further refine computed dense\noptical flow map FD using a generative-adversarial network (GAN) to obtain a\nmore realistic flow map. We devise a novel UNet based architecture to\nautoregressively generate future frames using the refined optical flow map by\nforward-warping the input image features at different resolutions. We conduct\nextensive experiments on a publicly available dataset and show that our method\nis superior to the baselines in terms of qualitative and quantitative metrics.\nIn addition, we show the qualitative animations of the objects in directions\nthat did not exist in the training set and provide a way to synthesize videos\nthat otherwise would not exist in the real world.",

However, the cost of\nobtaining annotation data is very high, especially for annotation of domain\nevents, which requires the participation of experts from corresponding domain.\nSo we introduce active learning (AL) technology to reduce the cost of event\nannotation.

We perform a subjective and objective evaluation to compare\nthe performance of each vocoder along a different axis. Our results demonstrate\nthat the framework is capable of showing the competitive efficacy and the\nquality of the synthesized samples for each vocoder. VocBench framework is\navailable at https://github.com/facebookresearch/vocoder-benchmark.",

    "title": "Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Timed Subgoals",
    "abstract": "Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) holds great potential for\nsample-efficient learning on challenging long-horizon tasks. In particular,\nletting a higher level assign subgoals to a lower level has been shown to\nenable fast learning on difficult problems. However, such subgoal-based methods\nhave been designed with static reinforcement learning environments in mind and\nconsequently struggle with dynamic elements beyond the immediate control of the\nagent even though they are ubiquitous in real-world problems. In this paper, we\nintroduce Hierarchical reinforcement learning with Timed Subgoals (HiTS), an\nHRL algorithm that enables the agent to adapt its timing to a dynamic\nenvironment by not only specifying what goal state is to be reached but also\nwhen. We discuss how communicating with a lower level in terms of such timed\nsubgoals results in a more stable learning problem for the higher level. Our\nexperiments on a range of standard benchmarks and three new challenging dynamic\nreinforcement learning environments show that our method is capable of\nsample-efficient learning where an existing state-of-the-art subgoal-based HRL\nmethod fails to learn stable solutions.",

    "abstract": "By illuminating latent structures in a corpus of text, topic models are an\nessential tool for categorizing, summarizing, and exploring large collections\nof documents. Probabilistic topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation\n(LDA), describe how words in documents are generated via a set of latent\ndistributions called topics. Recently, the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) has\nextended LDA to utilize the semantic information in word embeddings to derive\nsemantically richer topics. As LDA and its extensions are unsupervised models,\nthey aren't defined to make efficient use of a user's prior knowledge of the\ndomain. To this end, we propose the Keyword Assisted Embedded Topic Model\n(KeyETM), which equips ETM with the ability to incorporate user knowledge in\nthe form of informative topic-level priors over the vocabulary. Using both\nquantitative metrics and human responses on a topic intrusion task, we\ndemonstrate that KeyETM produces better topics than other guided, generative\nmodels in the literature.",

    "abstract": "We propose a methodology for extracting concepts for a target domain from\nlarge-scale linked open data (LOD) to support the construction of domain\nontologies providing field-specific knowledge and definitions. The proposed\nmethod defines search entities by linking the LOD vocabulary with technical\nterms related to the target domain. The search entities are then used as a\nstarting point for obtaining upper-level concepts in the LOD, and the\noccurrences of common upper-level entities and the chain-of-path relationships\nare examined to determine the range of conceptual connections in the target\ndomain. A technical dictionary index and natural language processing are used\nto evaluate whether the extracted concepts cover the domain. As an example of\nextracting a class hierarchy from LOD, we used Wikidata to construct a domain\nontology for polymer materials and physical properties. The proposed method can\nbe applied to general datasets with class hierarchies, and it allows ontology\ndevelopers to create an initial model of the domain ontology for their own\npurposes.",

    "abstract": "Over the years, topic models have provided an efficient way of extracting\ninsights from text. However, while many models have been proposed, none are\nable to model topic temporality and hierarchy jointly. Modelling time provide\nmore precise topics by separating lexically close but temporally distinct\ntopics while modelling hierarchy provides a more detailed view of the content\nof a document corpus. In this study, we therefore propose a novel method,\nHTMOT, to perform Hierarchical Topic Modelling Over Time. We train HTMOT using\na new implementation of Gibbs sampling, which is more efficient. Specifically,\nwe show that only applying time modelling to deep sub-topics provides a way to\nextract specific stories or events while high level topics extract larger\nthemes in the corpus. Our results show that our training procedure is fast and\ncan extract accurate high-level topics and temporally precise sub-topics.

Our algorithm computes such a sparsifier in time\n$O(m\\cdot\\min(\\alpha(n)\\log(m/n),\\log (n)))$, where $\\alpha(\\cdot)$ is the\nfunctional inverse of Ackermann's function, both for graphs with polynomially\nbounded and unbounded integer weights. This improves upon the state of the art\nby Bencz\\'ur and Karger (SICOMP 2015), which takes $O(m\\log^2 (n))$ rounds. For\nunbounded weights, this directly gives the best known result for cut\nsparsification. Together with preprocessing by an algorithm of Fung et al.\n(SICOMP 2019), this also gives the best known result for polynomially-weighted\ngraphs. Consequently, this implies the fastest approximate min-cut algorithm,\nboth for graphs with polynomial and unbounded weights. In particular, we show\nthat it is possible to adapt the state of the art algorithm of Fung et al.\n(SICOMP 2019) for unweighted graphs to weighted graphs, by letting the partial\nmaximum spanning forest (MSF) packing take the place of the Nagamochi-Ibaraki\n(NI) forest packing.

To preserve the semantic relation between source and\ntarget classes when only trained with data from source classes, we address the\nquantification of the knowledge transfer and semantic relation from an\ninformation-theoretic viewpoint. To this end, we follow the prototypical model\nand format the variables of concern as a probability vector. Leveraging on the\nproposed probability vector representation, the information measurement such as\nmutual information and entropy, can be effectively evaluated with simple closed\nforms. We discuss the choice of common embedding space and distance function\nwhen using the prototypical model. Then We propose three information-theoretic\nloss functions for deterministic GZSL model: a mutual information loss to\nbridge seen data and target classes; an uncertainty-aware entropy constraint\nloss to prevent overfitting when using seen data to learn the embedding of\ntarget classes; a semantic preserving cross entropy loss to preserve the\nsemantic relation when mapping the semantic representations to the common\nspace. Simulation shows that, as a deterministic model, our proposed method\nobtains state of the art results on GZSL benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have shown impressive performance for generative modelling\nof images. In this paper, we present a novel semantic segmentation method based\non diffusion models. By modifying the training and sampling scheme, we show\nthat diffusion models can perform lesion segmentation of medical images. To\ngenerate an image specific segmentation, we train the model on the ground truth\nsegmentation, and use the image as a prior during training and in every step\nduring the sampling process. With the given stochastic sampling process, we can\ngenerate a distribution of segmentation masks. This property allows us to\ncompute pixel-wise uncertainty maps of the segmentation, and allows an implicit\nensemble of segmentations that increases the segmentation performance. We\nevaluate our method on the BRATS2020 dataset for brain tumor segmentation.\nCompared to state-of-the-art segmentation models, our approach yields good\nsegmentation results and, additionally, meaningful uncertainty maps.",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning is an effective tool to learn robot control\npolicies from scratch. However, these methods are notorious for the enormous\namount of required training data which is prohibitively expensive to collect on\nreal robots. A highly popular alternative is to learn from simulations,\nallowing to generate the data much faster, safer, and cheaper. Since all\nsimulators are mere models of reality, there are inevitable differences between\nthe simulated and the real data, often referenced as the 'reality gap'. To\nbridge this gap, many approaches learn one policy from a distribution over\nsimulators. In this paper, we propose to combine reinforcement learning from\nrandomized physics simulations with policy distillation. Our algorithm, called\nDistilled Domain Randomization (DiDoR), distills so-called teacher policies,\nwhich are experts on domains that have been sampled initially, into a student\npolicy that is later deployed. This way, DiDoR learns controllers which\ntransfer directly from simulation to reality, i.e., without requiring data from\nthe target domain. We compare DiDoR against three baselines in three sim-to-sim\nas well as two sim-to-real experiments. Our results show that the target domain\nperformance of policies trained with DiDoR is en par or better than the\nbaselines'. Moreover, our approach neither increases the required memory\ncapacity nor the time to compute an action, which may well be a point of\nfailure for successfully deploying the learned controller.",

    "abstract": "We focus on controllable disentangled representation learning (C-Dis-RL),\nwhere users can control the partition of the disentangled latent space to\nfactorize dataset attributes (concepts) for downstream tasks. Two general\nproblems remain under-explored in current methods: (1) They lack comprehensive\ndisentanglement constraints, especially missing the minimization of mutual\ninformation between different attributes across latent and observation domains.\n(2) They lack convexity constraints in disentangled latent space, which is\nimportant for meaningfully manipulating specific attributes for downstream\ntasks. To encourage both comprehensive C-Dis-RL and convexity simultaneously,\nwe propose a simple yet efficient method: Controllable Interpolation\nRegularization (CIR), which creates a positive loop where the disentanglement\nand convexity can help each other. Specifically, we conduct controlled\ninterpolation in latent space during training and 'reuse' the encoder to help\nform a 'perfect disentanglement' regularization. In that case, (a)\ndisentanglement loss implicitly enlarges the potential 'understandable'\ndistribution to encourage convexity; (b) convexity can in turn improve robust\nand precise disentanglement. CIR is a general module and we merge CIR with\nthree different algorithms: ELEGANT, I2I-Dis, and GZS-Net to show the\ncompatibility and effectiveness. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show\nimprovement in C-Dis-RL and latent convexity by CIR. This further improves\ndownstream tasks: controllable image synthesis, cross-modality image\ntranslation and zero-shot synthesis. More experiments demonstrate CIR can also\nimprove other downstream tasks, such as new attribute value mining, data\naugmentation, and eliminating bias for fairness.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation is a key computer vision task that has been actively\nresearched for decades. In recent years, supervised methods have reached\nunprecedented accuracy, however they require many pixel-level annotations for\nevery new class category which is very time-consuming and expensive.\nAdditionally, the ability of current semantic segmentation networks to handle a\nlarge number of categories is limited. That means that images containing rare\nclass categories are unlikely to be well segmented by current methods. In this\npaper we propose a novel approach for creating semantic segmentation masks for\nevery object, without the need for training segmentation networks or seeing any\nsegmentation masks. Our method takes as input the image-level labels of the\nclass categories present in the image; they can be obtained automatically or\nmanually. We utilize a vision-language embedding model (specifically CLIP) to\ncreate a rough segmentation map for each class, using model interpretability\nmethods. We refine the maps using a test-time augmentation technique. The\noutput of this stage provides pixel-level pseudo-labels, instead of the manual\npixel-level labels required by supervised methods. Given the pseudo-labels, we\nutilize single-image segmentation techniques to obtain high-quality output\nsegmentation masks. Our method is shown quantitatively and qualitatively to\noutperform methods that use a similar amount of supervision. Our results are\nparticularly remarkable for images containing rare categories.",

In this paper, we revisit the problem under a setting where the total\nnumber of items T is known in advance, also known as the closed online bin\npacking problem. Specifically, we study both the stochastic model and the\nrandom permutation model. We develop and analyze an adaptive algorithm that\nsolves an offline bin packing problem at geometric time intervals and uses the\noffline optimal solution to guide online packing decisions. Under both models,\nwe show that the algorithm achieves C\\sqrt{T} regret (in terms of the number of\nused bins) compared to the hindsight optimal solution, where C is a universal\nconstant (<= 13) that bears no dependence on the underlying distribution or the\nitem sizes. The result shows the lower bound barrier of \\Omega(\\sqrt{T \\log T})\nin Shor (1986) can be broken with solely the knowledge of the horizon T, but\nwithout a need of knowing the underlying distribution. As to the algorithm\nanalysis, we develop a new approach to analyzing the packing dynamic using the\nnotion of exchangeable random variables. The approach creates a symmetrization\nbetween the offline solution and the online solution, and it is used to analyze\nboth the algorithm performance and various benchmarks related to the bin\npacking problem. For the latter one, our analysis provides an alternative\n(probably simpler) treatment and tightens the analysis of the asymptotic\nbenchmark of the stochastic bin packing problem in Rhee and Talagrand\n(1989a,b).

    "abstract": "Text summarization methods have attracted much attention all the time. In\nrecent years, deep learning has been applied to text summarization, and it\nturned out to be pretty effective. However, most of the current text\nsummarization methods based on deep learning need large-scale datasets, which\nis difficult to achieve in practical applications. In this paper, an\nunsupervised extractive text summarization method based on multi-round\ncalculation is proposed. Based on the directed graph algorithm, we change the\ntraditional method of calculating the sentence ranking at one time to\nmulti-round calculation, and the summary sentences are dynamically optimized\nafter each round of calculation to better match the characteristics of the\ntext. In this paper, experiments are carried out on four data sets, each\nseparately containing Chinese, English, long and short texts. The experiment\nresults show that our method has better performance than both baseline methods\nand other unsupervised methods and is robust on different datasets.",

In NLP,\nsystematic features of LM generalization to individual examples are well\ncharacterized, but systematic aspects of LM adaptability to new tasks are not\nnearly as well understood. We present a large-scale empirical study of the\nfeatures and limits of LM adaptability using a new benchmark, TaskBench500,\nbuilt from 500 procedurally generated sequence modeling tasks. These tasks\ncombine core aspects of language processing, including lexical semantics,\nsequence processing, memorization, logical reasoning, and world knowledge.\nUsing TaskBench500, we evaluate three facets of adaptability, finding that: (1)\nadaptation procedures differ dramatically in their ability to memorize small\ndatasets; (2) within a subset of task types, adaptation procedures exhibit\ncompositional adaptability to complex tasks; and (3) failure to match training\nlabel distributions is explained by mismatches in the intrinsic difficulty of\npredicting individual labels. Our experiments show that adaptability to new\ntasks, like generalization to new examples, can be systematically described and\nunderstood, and we conclude with a discussion of additional aspects of\nadaptability that could be studied using the new benchmark.",

Geometric intersection\ngraph classes have been studied from both the theoretical and practical point\nof view. On the one hand, many hard problems can be efficiently solved or\napproximated when the input graph is restricted to a geometric intersection\nclass of graphs. On the other hand, these graphs appear naturally in many\napplications such as sensor networks, scheduling problems, and others.\nRecently, in the context of distributed certification and distributed\ninteractive proofs, the recognition of graph classes has started to be\nintensively studied. Different results related to the recognition of trees,\nbipartite graphs, bounded diameter graphs, triangle-free graphs, planar graphs,\nbounded genus graphs, $H$-minor free graphs, etc., have been obtained.\nThe goal of the present work is to design efficient distributed protocols for\nthe recognition of relevant geometric intersection graph classes, namely\npermutation graphs, trapezoid graphs, circle graphs, and polygon-circle graphs.\nMore precisely, for the two first classes, we give proof labeling schemes\nrecognizing them with logarithmic-sized certificates.

Building models are ubiquitous since they\nare needed at each stage of the life of buildings, i.e. for design,\nretrofitting, and control operations. Classical white-box models, based on\nphysical equations, are bound to follow the laws of physics but the specific\ndesign of their underlying structure might hinder their expressiveness and\nhence their accuracy. On the other hand, black-box models are better suited to\ncapture nonlinear building dynamics and thus can often achieve better accuracy,\nbut they require a lot of data and might not follow the laws of physics, a\nproblem that is particularly common for neural network (NN) models. To counter\nthis known generalization issue, physics-informed NNs have recently been\nintroduced, where researchers introduce prior knowledge in the structure of NNs\nto ground them in known underlying physical laws and avoid classical NN\ngeneralization issues.\nIn this work, we present a novel physics-informed NN architecture, dubbed\nPhysically Consistent NN (PCNN), which only requires past operational data and\nno engineering overhead, including prior knowledge in a linear module running\nin parallel to a classical NN. We formally prove that such networks are\nphysically consistent -- by design and even on unseen data -- with respect to\ndifferent control inputs and temperatures outside and in neighboring zones. We\ndemonstrate their performance on a case study, where the PCNN attains an\naccuracy up to $50\\%$ better than a classical physics-based\nresistance-capacitance model on $3$-day long prediction horizons.

The more commonly studied\naspect of this phenomenon corresponds to model-wise double descent where the\ntest error exhibits a second descent with increasing model complexity, beyond\nthe classical U-shaped error curve. In this work, we investigate the origins of\nthe less studied epoch-wise double descent in which the test error undergoes\ntwo non-monotonous transitions, or descents as the training time increases. By\nleveraging tools from statistical physics, we study a linear teacher-student\nsetup exhibiting epoch-wise double descent similar to that in deep neural\nnetworks. In this setting, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for the\nevolution of generalization error over training. We find that double descent\ncan be attributed to distinct features being learned at different scales: as\nfast-learning features overfit, slower-learning features start to fit,\nresulting in a second descent in test error. We validate our findings through\nnumerical experiments where our theory accurately predicts empirical findings\nand remains consistent with observations in deep neural networks.",

    "abstract": "The original \"Seven Motifs\" set forth a roadmap of essential methods for the\nfield of scientific computing, where a motif is an algorithmic method that\ncaptures a pattern of computation and data movement. We present the \"Nine\nMotifs of Simulation Intelligence\", a roadmap for the development and\nintegration of the essential algorithms necessary for a merger of scientific\ncomputing, scientific simulation, and artificial intelligence. We call this\nmerger simulation intelligence (SI), for short. We argue the motifs of\nsimulation intelligence are interconnected and interdependent, much like the\ncomponents within the layers of an operating system. Using this metaphor, we\nexplore the nature of each layer of the simulation intelligence operating\nsystem stack (SI-stack) and the motifs therein: (1) Multi-physics and\nmulti-scale modeling; (2) Surrogate modeling and emulation; (3)\nSimulation-based inference; (4) Causal modeling and inference; (5) Agent-based\nmodeling; (6) Probabilistic programming; (7) Differentiable programming; (8)\nOpen-ended optimization; (9) Machine programming. We believe coordinated\nefforts between motifs offers immense opportunity to accelerate scientific\ndiscovery, from solving inverse problems in synthetic biology and climate\nscience, to directing nuclear energy experiments and predicting emergent\nbehavior in socioeconomic settings. We elaborate on each layer of the SI-stack,\ndetailing the state-of-art methods, presenting examples to highlight challenges\nand opportunities, and advocating for specific ways to advance the motifs and\nthe synergies from their combinations. Advancing and integrating these\ntechnologies can enable a robust and efficient hypothesis-simulation-analysis\ntype of scientific method, which we introduce with several use-cases for\nhuman-machine teaming and automated science.",

    "abstract": "Phrase detection requires methods to identify if a phrase is relevant to an\nimage and then localize it if applicable. A key challenge in training more\ndiscriminative phrase detection models is sampling hard-negatives. This is\nbecause few phrases are annotated of the nearly infinite variations that may be\napplicable. To address this problem, we introduce PFP-Net, a phrase detector\nthat differentiates between phrases through two novel methods. First, we group\ntogether phrases of related objects into coarse groups of visually coherent\nconcepts (eg animals vs automobiles), and then train our PFP-Net to\ndiscriminate between them according to their concept membership. Second, for\nphrases containing fine grained mutually-exclusive tokens (eg colors), we force\nthe model into selecting only one applicable phrase for each region. We\nevaluate our approach on the Flickr30K Entities and RefCOCO+ datasets, where we\nimprove mAP over the state-of-the-art by 1-1.5 points over all phrases on this\nchallenging task. When considering only the phrases affected by our\nfine-grained reasoning module, we improve by 1-4 points on both datasets.",

    "abstract": "Scholars have focused on algorithms used during sentencing, bail, and parole,\nbut little work explores what we call carceral algorithms that are used during\nincarceration. This paper is focused on the Pennsylvania Additive\nClassification Tool (PACT) used to classify prisoners' custody levels while\nthey are incarcerated. Algorithms that are used during incarceration warrant\ndeeper attention by scholars because they have the power to enact the lived\nreality of the prisoner. The algorithm in this case determines the likelihood a\nperson would endure additional disciplinary actions, can complete required\nprogramming, and gain experiences that, among other things, are distilled into\nvariables feeding into the parole algorithm. Given such power, examining\nalgorithms used on people currently incarcerated offers a unique analytic view\nto think about the dialectic relationship between data and algorithms. Our\nexamination of the PACT is two-fold and complementary. First, our qualitative\noverview of the historical context surrounding PACT reveals that it is designed\nto prioritize incapacitation and control over rehabilitation. While it closely\ninforms prisoner rehabilitation plans and parole considerations, it is rooted\nin population management for prison securitization. Second, on analyzing data\nfor 146,793 incarcerated people in PA, along with associated metadata related\nto the PACT, we find it is replete with racial bias as well as errors,\nomissions, and inaccuracies.

    "abstract": "Neural field models are nonlinear integro-differential equations for the\nevolution of neuronal activity, and they are a prototypical large-scale,\ncoarse-grained neuronal model in continuum cortices. Neural fields are often\nsimulated heuristically and, in spite of their popularity in mathematical\nneuroscience, their numerical analysis is not yet fully established. We\nintroduce generic projection methods for neural fields, and derive a-priori\nerror bounds for these schemes. We extend an existing framework for stationary\nintegral equations to the time-dependent case, which is relevant for\nneuroscience applications. We find that the convergence rate of a projection\nscheme for a neural field is determined to a great extent by the convergence\nrate of the projection operator. This abstract analysis, which unifies the\ntreatment of collocation and Galerkin schemes, is carried out in operator form,\nwithout resorting to quadrature rules for the integral term, which are\nintroduced only at a later stage, and whose choice is enslaved by the choice of\nthe projector. Using an elementary timestepper as an example, we demonstrate\nthat the error in a time stepper has two separate contributions: one from the\nprojector, and one from the time discretisation. We give examples of concrete\nprojection methods: two collocation schemes (piecewise-linear and spectral\ncollocation) and two Galerkin schemes (finite elements and spectral Galerkin);\nfor each of them we derive error bounds from the general theory, introduce\nseveral discrete variants, provide implementation details, and present\nreproducible convergence tests.",

We address in this work a\ncontinual scene generation setup in which GANs are trained on a stream of\ndistinct domains; ideally, the learned models should eventually be able to\ngenerate new scenes in all seen domains. This setup reflects the real-life\nscenario where data are continuously acquired in different places at different\ntimes. In such a continual setup, we aim for learning with zero forgetting,\ni.e., with no degradation in synthesis quality over earlier domains due to\ncatastrophic forgetting. To this end, we introduce a novel framework that not\nonly (i) enables seamless knowledge transfer in continual training but also\n(ii) guarantees zero forgetting with a small overhead cost. While being more\nmemory efficient, thanks to continual learning, our model obtains better\nsynthesis quality as compared against the brute-force solution that trains one\nfull model for each domain.

We introduce a gradient-based optimization framework\nfor achieving acceleration, based on the recently introduced notion of\nfixed-time stability of dynamical systems. The method presents itself as a\ngeneralization of simple gradient-based methods suitably scaled to achieve\nconvergence to the optimizer in a fixed-time, independent of the\ninitialization. We achieve this by first leveraging a continuous-time framework\nfor designing fixed-time stable dynamical systems, and later providing a\nconsistent discretization strategy, such that the equivalent discrete-time\nalgorithm tracks the optimizer in a practically fixed number of iterations. We\nalso provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence behavior of the proposed\ngradient flows, and their robustness to additive disturbances for a range of\nfunctions obeying strong convexity, strict convexity, and possibly nonconvexity\nbut satisfying the Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz inequality. We also show that the\nregret bound on the convergence rate is constant by virtue of the fixed-time\nconvergence.

    "abstract": "The feasibility of making profitable trades on a single asset on stock\nexchanges based on patterns identification has long attracted researchers.\nReinforcement Learning (RL) and Natural Language Processing have gained\nnotoriety in these single-asset trading tasks, but only a few works have\nexplored their combination. Moreover, some issues are still not addressed, such\nas extracting market sentiment momentum through the explicit capture of\nsentiment features that reflect the market condition over time and assessing\nthe consistency and stability of RL results in different situations. Filling\nthis gap, we propose the Sentiment-Aware RL (SentARL) intelligent trading\nsystem that improves profit stability by leveraging market mood through an\nadaptive amount of past sentiment features drawn from textual news. We\nevaluated SentARL across twenty assets, two transaction costs, and five\ndifferent periods and initializations to show its consistent effectiveness\nagainst baselines. Subsequently, this thorough assessment allowed us to\nidentify the boundary between news coverage and market sentiment regarding the\ncorrelation of price-time series above which SentARL's effectiveness is\noutstanding.",

    "title": "View-Consistent Metal Segmentation in the Projection Domain for Metal  Artifact Reduction in CBCT -- An Investigation of Potential Improvement",
    "abstract": "The positive outcome of a trauma intervention depends on an intraoperative\nevaluation of inserted metallic implants. Due to occurring metal artifacts, the\nquality of this evaluation heavily depends on the performance of so-called\nMetal Artifact Reduction methods (MAR). The majority of these MAR methods\nrequire prior segmentation of the inserted metal objects. Therefore, typically\na rather simple thresholding-based segmentation method in the reconstructed 3D\nvolume is applied, despite some major disadvantages. With this publication, the\npotential of shifting the segmentation task to a learning-based,\nview-consistent 2D projection-based method on the downstream MAR's outcome is\ninvestigated. For segmenting the present metal, a rather simple learning-based\n2D projection-wise segmentation network that is trained using real data\nacquired during cadaver studies, is examined. To overcome the disadvantages\nthat come along with a 2D projection-wise segmentation, a Consistency Filter is\nproposed. The influence of the shifted segmentation domain is investigated by\ncomparing the results of the standard fsMAR with a modified fsMAR version using\nthe new segmentation masks. With a quantitative and qualitative evaluation on\nreal cadaver data, the investigated approach showed an increased MAR\nperformance and a high insensitivity against metal artifacts. For cases with\nmetal outside the reconstruction's FoV or cases with vanishing metal, a\nsignificant reduction in artifacts could be shown. Thus, increases of up to\nroughly 3 dB w.r.t. the mean PSNR metric over all slices and up to 9 dB for\nsingle slices were achieved. The shown results reveal a beneficial influence of\nthe shift to a 2D-based segmentation method on real data for downstream use\nwith a MAR method, like the fsMAR.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have demonstrated their ability to\nsegment 2D cardiac ultrasound images. However, despite recent successes\naccording to which the intra-observer variability on end-diastole and\nend-systole images has been reached, CNNs still struggle to leverage temporal\ninformation to provide accurate and temporally consistent segmentation maps\nacross the whole cycle. Such consistency is required to accurately describe the\ncardiac function, a necessary step in diagnosing many cardiovascular diseases.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework to learn the 2D+time long-axis cardiac\nshape such that the segmented sequences can benefit from temporal and\nanatomical consistency constraints. Our method is a post-processing that takes\nas input segmented echocardiographic sequences produced by any state-of-the-art\nmethod and processes it in two steps to (i) identify spatio-temporal\ninconsistencies according to the overall dynamics of the cardiac sequence and\n(ii) correct the inconsistencies. The identification and correction of cardiac\ninconsistencies relies on a constrained autoencoder trained to learn a\nphysiologically interpretable embedding of cardiac shapes, where we can both\ndetect and fix anomalies. We tested our framework on 98 full-cycle sequences\nfrom the CAMUS dataset, which will be rendered public alongside this paper. Our\ntemporal regularization method not only improves the accuracy of the\nsegmentation across the whole sequences, but also enforces temporal and\nanatomical consistency.",

While\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is increasingly used to guide targeted\nbiopsies for prostate cancer diagnosis, its utility remains limited due to high\nrates of false positives and false negatives as well as low inter-reader\nagreements. Machine learning methods to detect and localize cancer on prostate\nMRI can help standardize radiologist interpretations. However, existing machine\nlearning methods vary not only in model architecture, but also in the ground\ntruth labeling strategies used for model training. In this study, we compare\ndifferent labeling strategies, namely, pathology-confirmed radiologist labels,\npathologist labels on whole-mount histopathology images, and lesion-level and\npixel-level digital pathologist labels (previously validated deep learning\nalgorithm on histopathology images to predict pixel-level Gleason patterns) on\nwhole-mount histopathology images. We analyse the effects these labels have on\nthe performance of the trained machine learning models. Our experiments show\nthat (1) radiologist labels and models trained with them can miss cancers, or\nunderestimate cancer extent, (2) digital pathologist labels and models trained\nwith them have high concordance with pathologist labels, and (3) models trained\nwith digital pathologist labels achieve the best performance in prostate cancer\ndetection in two different cohorts with different disease distributions,\nirrespective of the model architecture used. Digital pathologist labels can\nreduce challenges associated with human annotations, including labor, time,\ninter- and intra-reader variability, and can help bridge the gap between\nprostate radiology and pathology by enabling the training of reliable machine\nlearning models to detect and localize prostate cancer on MRI.",

    "abstract": "Finding high-quality solutions to mixed-integer linear programming problems\n(MILPs) is of great importance for many practical applications. In this\nrespect, the refinement heuristic local branching (LB) has been proposed to\nproduce improving solutions and has been highly influential for the development\nof local search methods in MILP. The algorithm iteratively explores a sequence\nof solution neighborhoods defined by the so-called local branching constraint,\nnamely, a linear inequality limiting the distance from a reference solution.\nFor a LB algorithm, the choice of the neighborhood size is critical to\nperformance. Although it was initialized by a conservative value in the\noriginal LB scheme, our new observation is that the best size is strongly\ndependent on the particular MILP instance. In this work, we investigate the\nrelation between the size of the search neighborhood and the behavior of the\nunderlying LB algorithm, and we devise a leaning based framework for guiding\nthe neighborhood search of the LB heuristic. The framework consists of a\ntwo-phase strategy. For the first phase, a scaled regression model is trained\nto predict the size of the LB neighborhood at the first iteration through a\nregression task. In the second phase, we leverage reinforcement learning and\ndevise a reinforced neighborhood search strategy to dynamically adapt the size\nat the subsequent iterations. We computationally show that the neighborhood\nsize can indeed be learned, leading to improved performances and that the\noverall algorithm generalizes well both with respect to the instance size and,\nremarkably, across instances.",

We derive the worst-case attack for the GLRT defense, and show\nthat its asymptotic performance (as the dimension of the data increases)\napproaches that of the minimax defense. For non-asymptotic regimes, we show via\nsimulations that the GLRT defense is competitive with the minimax approach\nunder the worst-case attack, while yielding a better robustness-accuracy\ntradeoff under weaker attacks.

    "title": "Resource Theories as Quantale Modules",
    "abstract": "We aim to counter the tendency for specialization in science by advancing a\nlanguage that can facilitate the translation of ideas and methods between\ndisparate contexts. The focus is on questions of \"resource-theoretic nature\".\nIn a resource theory, one identifies resources and allowed manipulations that\ncan be used to transform them. Some of the main questions are: How to optimize\nresources? What are the trade-offs between them? Can a given resource be\nconverted to another one via the allowed manipulations?\nBecause of their ubiquity, methods used to answer them in one context can be\nused to tackle corresponding questions in new contexts. The translation occurs\nin two stages. Firstly, methods are generalized to the abstract language. Then,\none can determine whether potentially novel contexts can accommodate them.\nWe focus on the first stage, by introducing two variants of an abstract\nframework in which existing and yet unidentified resource theories can be\nrepresented. Using these, the task of generalizing concrete methods is tackled\nin chapter 4 by studying the ways in which meaningful measures of resources may\nbe constructed.\nOne construction expresses a notion of cost (or yield) of a resource. Among\nother applications, it may be used to extend measures from a subset of\nresources to a larger domain.\nAnother construction allows the translation of resource measures from one\nresource theory to another. Special cases include resource robustness and\nweight measures, as well as relative entropy based measures quantifying minimal\ndistinguishability from freely available resources.\nWe instantiate some of these ideas in a resource theory of distinguishability\nin chapter 5. It describes the utility of systems with probabilistic behavior\nfor the task of distinguishing between hypotheses, which said behavior may\ndepend on.",

The current paper shows that a\nrelated observation applies to the estimation of nonparametric mixing\ndistributions in discrete exponential family models, where under the GOT cost\nthe estimation accuracy of the nonparametric MLE can be accelerated to a\npolynomial rate. This is in sharp contrast to the classical sub-polynomial\nrates based on unsmoothed metrics, which cannot be improved from an\ninformation-theoretical perspective.

    "abstract": "Background and Objective: Artificial intelligence (AI) methods coupled with\nbiomedical analysis has a critical role during pandemics as it helps to release\nthe overwhelming pressure from healthcare systems and physicians. As the\nongoing COVID-19 crisis worsens in countries having dense populations and\ninadequate testing kits like Brazil and India, radiological imaging can act as\nan important diagnostic tool to accurately classify covid-19 patients and\nprescribe the necessary treatment in due time. With this motivation, we present\nour study based on deep learning architecture for detecting covid-19 infected\nlungs using chest X-rays. Dataset: We collected a total of 2470 images for\nthree different class labels, namely, healthy lungs, ordinary pneumonia, and\ncovid-19 infected pneumonia, out of which 470 X-ray images belong to the\ncovid-19 category. Methods: We first pre-process all the images using histogram\nequalization techniques and segment them using U-net architecture. VGG-16\nnetwork is then used for feature extraction from the pre-processed images which\nis further sampled by SMOTE oversampling technique to achieve a balanced\ndataset. Finally, the class-balanced features are classified using a support\nvector machine (SVM) classifier with 10-fold cross-validation and the accuracy\nis evaluated. Result and Conclusion: Our novel approach combining well-known\npre-processing techniques, feature extraction methods, and dataset balancing\nmethod, lead us to an outstanding rate of recognition of 98% for COVID-19\nimages over a dataset of 2470 X-ray images. Our model is therefore fit to be\nutilized in healthcare facilities for screening purposes.",

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation is a fundamental and critical step in many\nclinical approaches. Semi-supervised learning has been widely applied to\nmedical image segmentation tasks since it alleviates the heavy burden of\nacquiring expert-examined annotations and takes the advantage of unlabeled data\nwhich is much easier to acquire. Although consistency learning has been proven\nto be an effective approach by enforcing an invariance of predictions under\ndifferent distributions, existing approaches cannot make full use of\nregion-level shape constraint and boundary-level distance information from\nunlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-guided mutual\nconsistency learning framework to effectively exploit unlabeled data by\nintegrating intra-task consistency learning from up-to-date predictions for\nself-ensembling and cross-task consistency learning from task-level\nregularization to exploit geometric shape information. The framework is guided\nby the estimated segmentation uncertainty of models to select out relatively\ncertain predictions for consistency learning, so as to effectively exploit more\nreliable information from unlabeled data. We extensively validate our proposed\nmethod on two publicly available benchmark datasets: Left Atrium Segmentation\n(LA) dataset and Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) dataset. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method achieves performance gains by leveraging unlabeled\ndata and outperforms existing semi-supervised segmentation methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper study the reconstruction of High Dynamic Range (HDR) video from\nsnapshot-coded LDR video. Constructing an HDR video requires restoring the HDR\nvalues for each frame and maintaining the consistency between successive\nframes. HDR image acquisition from single image capture, also known as snapshot\nHDR imaging, can be achieved in several ways. For example, the reconfigurable\nsnapshot HDR camera is realized by introducing an optical element into the\noptical stack of the camera; by placing a coded mask at a small standoff\ndistance in front of the sensor. High-quality HDR image can be recovered from\nthe captured coded image using deep learning methods. This study utilizes\n3D-CNNs to perform a joint demosaicking, denoising, and HDR video\nreconstruction from coded LDR video. We enforce more temporally consistent HDR\nvideo reconstruction by introducing a temporal loss function that considers the\nshort-term and long-term consistency. The obtained results are promising and\ncould lead to affordable HDR video capture using conventional cameras.",

Moreover, the\nperformance of the systems may be weakened due to domain mismatch between\nclinic and real-world data. Therefore, we aimed to develop a compressed and\ndomain-robust pathological voice detection system. Domain adversarial training\nwas utilized to address domain mismatch by extracting domain-invariant\nfeatures. In addition, factorized convolutional neural networks were exploited\nto compress the feature extractor model. The results showed that only 4% of\ndegradation of unweighted average recall occurred in the target domain compared\nto the source domain, indicating that the domain mismatch was effectively\neliminated. Furthermore, our system reduced both usages of memory and\ncomputation by over 73.9%.

We furthermore\nsimulate the flow around a low pressure turbine stator using the pix2pixHD\narchitecture for a conditional DCGAN being conditioned on the position of a\nrotating wake in front of the stator. The settings of adversarial training and\nthe effects of using specific GAN architectures are explained.

    "abstract": "Automatic delineation of organ-at-risk (OAR) and gross-tumor-volume (GTV) is\nof great significance for radiotherapy planning. However, it is a challenging\ntask to learn powerful representations for accurate delineation under limited\npixel (voxel)-wise annotations. Contrastive learning at pixel-level can\nalleviate the dependency on annotations by learning dense representations from\nunlabeled data. Recent studies in this direction design various contrastive\nlosses on the feature maps, to yield discriminative features for each pixel in\nthe map. However, pixels in the same map inevitably share semantics to be\ncloser than they actually are, which may affect the discrimination of pixels in\nthe same map and lead to the unfair comparison to pixels in other maps. To\naddress these issues, we propose a separated region-level contrastive learning\nscheme, namely SepaReg, the core of which is to separate each image into\nregions and encode each region separately. Specifically, SepaReg comprises two\ncomponents: a structure-aware image separation (SIS) module and an intra- and\ninter-organ distillation (IID) module. The SIS is proposed to operate on the\nimage set to rebuild a region set under the guidance of structural information.\nThe inter-organ representation will be learned from this set via typical\ncontrastive losses cross regions. On the other hand, the IID is proposed to\ntackle the quantity imbalance in the region set as tiny organs may produce\nfewer regions, by exploiting intra-organ representations. We conducted\nextensive experiments to evaluate the proposed model on a public dataset and\ntwo private datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed model, consistently achieving better performance than\nstate-of-the-art approaches.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on learning effective entity matching models over\nmulti-source large-scale data. For real applications, we relax typical\nassumptions that data distributions/spaces, or entity identities are shared\nbetween sources, and propose a Relaxed Multi-source Large-scale Entity-matching\n(RMLE) problem. Challenges of the problem include 1) how to align large-scale\nentities between sources to share information and 2) how to mitigate negative\ntransfer from joint learning multi-source data. What's worse, one practical\nissue is the entanglement between both challenges. Specifically, incorrect\nalignments may increase negative transfer; while mitigating negative transfer\nfor one source may result in poorly learned representations for other sources\nand then decrease alignment accuracy. To handle the entangled challenges, we\npoint out that the key is to optimize information sharing first based on Pareto\nfront optimization, by showing that information sharing significantly\ninfluences the Pareto front which depicts lower bounds of negative transfer.\nConsequently, we proposed an Incentive Compatible Pareto Alignment (ICPA)\nmethod to first optimize cross-source alignments based on Pareto front\noptimization, then mitigate negative transfer constrained on the optimized\nalignments. This mechanism renders each source can learn based on its true\npreference without worrying about deteriorating representations of other\nsources. Specifically, the Pareto front optimization encourages minimizing\nlower bounds of negative transfer, which optimizes whether and which to align.\nComprehensive empirical evaluation results on four large-scale datasets are\nprovided to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of ICPA. Online A/B\ntest results at a search advertising platform also demonstrate the\neffectiveness of ICPA in production environments.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in computationally efficient non-myopic Bayesian optimization\n(BO) improve query efficiency over traditional myopic methods like expected\nimprovement while only modestly increasing computational cost. These advances\nhave been largely limited, however, to unconstrained optimization. For\nconstrained optimization, the few existing non-myopic BO methods require heavy\ncomputation. For instance, one existing non-myopic constrained BO method [Lam\nand Willcox, 2017] relies on computationally expensive unreliable brute-force\nderivative-free optimization of a Monte Carlo rollout acquisition function.\nMethods that use the reparameterization trick for more efficient\nderivative-based optimization of non-myopic acquisition functions in the\nunconstrained setting, like sample average approximation and infinitesimal\nperturbation analysis, do not extend: constraints introduce discontinuities in\nthe sampled acquisition function surface that hinder its optimization.\nMoreover, we argue here that being non-myopic is even more important in\nconstrained problems because fear of violating constraints pushes myopic\nmethods away from sampling the boundary between feasible and infeasible\nregions, slowing the discovery of optimal solutions with tight constraints. In\nthis paper, we propose a computationally efficient two-step lookahead\nconstrained Bayesian optimization acquisition function (2-OPT-C) supporting\nboth sequential and batch settings. To enable fast acquisition function\noptimization, we develop a novel likelihood-ratio-based unbiased estimator of\nthe gradient of the two-step optimal acquisition function that does not use the\nreparameterization trick. In numerical experiments, 2-OPT-C typically improves\nquery efficiency by 2x or more over previous methods, and in some cases by 10x\nor more.",

    "abstract": "Performance of the sensor-based camera identification (SCI) method heavily\nrelies on the denoising filter in estimating Photo-Response Non-Uniformity\n(PRNU). Given various attempts on enhancing the quality of the extracted PRNU,\nit still suffers from unsatisfactory performance in low-resolution images and\nhigh computational demand. Leveraging the similarity of PRNU estimation and\nimage denoising, we take advantage of the latest achievements of Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN)-based denoisers for PRNU extraction. In this paper, a\ncomparative evaluation of such CNN denoisers on SCI performance is carried out\non the public \"Dresden Image Database\". Our findings are two-fold. From one\naspect, both the PRNU extraction and image denoising separate noise from the\nimage content. Hence, SCI can benefit from the recent CNN denoisers if\ncarefully trained. From another aspect, the goals and the scenarios of PRNU\nextraction and image denoising are different since one optimizes the quality of\nnoise and the other optimizes the image quality. A carefully tailored training\nis needed when CNN denoisers are used for PRNU estimation. Alternative\nstrategies of training data preparation and loss function design are analyzed\ntheoretically and evaluated experimentally. We point out that feeding the CNNs\nwith image-PRNU pairs and training them with correlation-based loss function\nresult in the best PRNU estimation performance. To facilitate further studies\nof SCI, we also propose a minimum-loss camera fingerprint quantization scheme\nusing which we save the fingerprints as image files in PNG format.

Here we study the interplay\nbetween these two mechanisms to see whether they are independent, interfering\nor synergetic. Using evolutionary game theory, we show that punishing\nantisocial agents and a regular networked structure not only promote prosocial\nbehaviours among agents playing the trust game, but they also interplay with\neach other, leading to interference or synergy, depending on the game\nparameters. Synergy emerges on a wider range of parameters than interference\ndoes.

    "abstract": "Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provides asymptotically consistent estimates\nof intractable posterior expectations as the number of iterations tends to\ninfinity. However, in large data applications, MCMC can be computationally\nexpensive per iteration. This has catalyzed interest in sampling methods such\nas approximate MCMC, which trade off asymptotic consistency for improved\ncomputational speed. In this article, we propose estimators based on couplings\nof Markov chains to assess the quality of such asymptotically biased sampling\nmethods. The estimators give empirical upper bounds of the Wassertein distance\nbetween the limiting distribution of the asymptotically biased sampling method\nand the original target distribution of interest. We establish theoretical\nguarantees for our upper bounds and show that our estimators can remain\neffective in high dimensions. We apply our quality measures to stochastic\ngradient MCMC, variational Bayes, and Laplace approximations for tall data and\nto approximate MCMC for Bayesian logistic regression in 4500 dimensions and\nBayesian linear regression in 50000 dimensions.",

    "title": "Posterior Cramer-Rao Lower Bound based Adaptive State Estimation for  Option Price Forecasting",
    "abstract": "The use of Bayesian filtering has been widely used in mathematical finance,\nprimarily in Stochastic Volatility models. They help in estimating unobserved\nlatent variables from observed market data. This field saw huge developments in\nrecent years, because of the increased computational power and increased\nresearch in the model parameter estimation and implied volatility theory. In\nthis paper, we design a novel method to estimate underlying states (volatility\nand risk) from option prices using Bayesian filtering theory and Posterior\nCramer-Rao Lower Bound (PCRLB), further using it for option price prediction.\nSeveral Bayesian filters like Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Unscented Kalman\nFilter (UKF), Particle Filter (PF) are used for latent state estimation of\nBlack-Scholes model under a GARCH model dynamics. We employ an Average and Best\ncase switching strategy for adaptive state estimation of a non-linear,\ndiscrete-time state space model (SSM) like Black-Scholes, using PCRLB based\nperformance measure to judge the best filter at each time step [1]. Since\nestimating closed-form solution of PCRLB is non-trivial, we employ a particle\nfilter based approximation of PCRLB based on [2]. We test our proposed\nframework on option data from S$\\&$P 500, estimating the underlying state from\nthe real option price, and using it to estimate theoretical price of the option\nand forecasting future prices. Our proposed method performs much better than\nthe individual applied filter used for estimating the underlying state and\nsubstantially improve forecasting capabilities.",

Online FDRC rules allow\nto control the properties of a sequence of statistical tests. In the context of\nanomaly detection, the null hypothesis is that an observation is normal and the\nalternative is that it is anomalous. FDRC rules allow users to target a lower\nbound on precision in unsupervised settings. The methods proposed in this\narticle overcome short-comings of previous FDRC rules in the context of anomaly\ndetection, in particular ensuring that power remains high even when the\nalternative is exceedingly rare (typical in anomaly detection) and the test\nstatistics are serially dependent (typical in time series). We show the\nsoundness of these rules in both theory and experiments.",

    "abstract": "All 88 keys of a piano at two stages, right after production (stage 1) and\none year after playing (stage 2) are investigated using Music Information\nRetrieval (MIR) timbre extraction and Machine Learning (ML). In\n\\cite{Plath2019} it was found that listeners clearly distinguished both stages\nbut no clear correlation with acoustics, signal processing tools or\nverbalizations of perceived differences could be found. Using a Self-Organizing\nMap (SOM) training single as well as double feature sets it is found that\nspectral flux is able to perfectly cluster the two pianos. Sound Pressure Level\n(SPL), roughness, and fractal correlation dimension, as a measure for initial\ntransient chaoticity are furthermore able to order the keys with respect to\nhigh and low tones. Combining spectral flux with the three other features in\ndouble-feature training sets maintain stage clustering only for SPL and fractal\ndimension, showing sub-clusters for both stages. These sub-clusters point to a\nhomogenization of SPL for stage 2 with respect to stage 1 and a pronounced\nordering and sub-clustering of key regions with respect to initial transient\nchaoticity.",

Clock generators, e.g., metronomes, or\ndrum machines, might assist such synchronization, but these means, in general,\nwill also distort this natural, self-organized, inter-human synchronization\nprocess. In this work, the synchronization of musicians to an external rhythm\nis modeled using the Impulse Pattern Formulation (IPF), an analytical modeling\napproach for synergetic systems motivated by research on musical instruments.\nNonlinear coupling of system components is described as the interaction of\nindividually propagating and exponentially damped impulse trains. The derived\nmodel is systematically examined by analyzing its behavior when coupled to\nnumerical designed and carefully controlled rhythmical beat sequences. The\nresults are evaluated by comparison in the light of other publications on\ntapping. Finally, the IPF model can be applied to analyze the personal\nrhythmical signature of specific musicians or to replace drum machines and\nclick tracks with more musical and creative solutions.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer, is amongst the most lethal of all\ncancers. Expression of the O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) gene\nin glioblastoma tumor tissue is of clinical importance as it has a significant\neffect on the efficacy of Temozolomide, the primary chemotherapy treatment\nadministered to glioblastoma patients. Currently, MGMT methylation is\ndetermined through an invasive brain biopsy and subsequent genetic analysis of\nthe extracted tumor tissue. In this work, we present novel Bayesian classifiers\nthat make probabilistic predictions of MGMT methylation status based on\nradiomic features extracted from FLAIR-sequence magnetic resonance imagery\n(MRIs). We implement local radiomic techniques to produce radiomic activation\nmaps and analyze MRIs for the MGMT biomarker based on statistical features of\nraw voxel-intensities. We demonstrate the ability for simple Bayesian\nclassifiers to provide a boost in predictive performance when modelling local\nradiomic data rather than global features. The presented techniques provide a\nnon-invasive MRI-based approach to determining MGMT methylation status in\nglioblastoma patients.",
