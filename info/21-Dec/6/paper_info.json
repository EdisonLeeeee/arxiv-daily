    "abstract": "Testing is a significant aspect of software development. As systems become\ncomplex and their use becomes critical to the security and the function of\nsociety, the need for testing methodologies that ensure reliability and detect\nfaults as early as possible becomes critical. The most promising approach is\nthe model-based approach where a model is developed that defines how the system\nis expected to behave and how it is meant to react. The tests are derived from\nthe model and an analysis of the test results is conducted based on it. We will\ninvestigate the prospects of using the Behavioral Programming (BP) for a\nmodel-based testing (MBT) approach that we will develop. We will develop a\nnatural language for representing the requirements. The model will be fed to\nalgorithms that we will develop. This includes algorithms for the automatic\ncreation of minimal sets of test cases that cover all of the system's\nrequirements, analysing the results of the tests, and other tools that support\nthe testing process. The focus of our methodology will be to find faults caused\nby the interaction between different requirements in ways that are difficult\nfor the testers to detect. Specifically, we will focus our attention to\nconcurrency issues such as deadlocks and logical race condition. We will use a\nvariety of methods that are made possible by BP, such as non-deterministic\nexecution of scenarios and use of in-code model-checking for building test\nscenarios and for finding minimal coverage of the test scenarios for the system\nrequirements using Combinatorial Test Design (CTD) methodologies. We will\ndevelop a proof-of-concept tool kit which will allow us to demonstrate and\nevaluate the above mentioned capabilities. We will compare the performance of\nour tools with the performance of manual testers and of other model-based tools\nusing comparison criteria that we will define and develop.",

Despite developments in both areas, the limited amount of\navailable 3D vision-language data causes overfitting issues for 3D visual\ngrounding and 3D dense captioning methods. Also, how to discriminatively\ndescribe objects in complex 3D environments is not fully studied yet. To\naddress these challenges, we present D3Net, an end-to-end neural\nspeaker-listener architecture that can detect, describe and discriminate. Our\nD3Net unifies dense captioning and visual grounding in 3D in a self-critical\nmanner. This self-critical property of D3Net also introduces discriminability\nduring object caption generation and enables semi-supervised training on\nScanNet data with partially annotated descriptions. Our method outperforms SOTA\nmethods in both tasks on the ScanRefer dataset, surpassing the SOTA 3D dense\ncaptioning method by a significant margin (23.56% CiDEr@0.5IoU improvement).",

Very recently, the inexact nature of approximate\ncomponents, such as approximate multipliers have also been reported successful\nin defending adversarial attacks on DNNs models. Since the approximation errors\ntraverse through the DNN layers as masked or unmasked, this raises a key\nresearch question-can approximate computing always offer a defense against\nadversarial attacks in DNNs, i.e., are they universally defensive? Towards\nthis, we present an extensive adversarial robustness analysis of different\napproximate DNN accelerators (AxDNNs) using the state-of-the-art approximate\nmultipliers. In particular, we evaluate the impact of ten adversarial attacks\non different AxDNNs using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our results\ndemonstrate that adversarial attacks on AxDNNs can cause 53% accuracy loss\nwhereas the same attack may lead to almost no accuracy loss (as low as 0.06%)\nin the accurate DNN. Thus, approximate computing cannot be referred to as a\nuniversal defense strategy against adversarial attacks.",

We approach text-to-image generation by combining the\npower of the retrained CLIP representation with an off-the-shelf image\ngenerator (GANs), optimizing in the latent space of GAN to find images that\nachieve maximum CLIP score with the given input text. Compared to traditional\nmethods that train generative models from text to image starting from scratch,\nthe CLIP+GAN approach is training-free, zero shot and can be easily customized\nwith different generators.\nHowever, optimizing CLIP score in the GAN space casts a highly challenging\noptimization problem and off-the-shelf optimizers such as Adam fail to yield\nsatisfying results. In this work, we propose a FuseDream pipeline, which\nimproves the CLIP+GAN approach with three key techniques: 1) an AugCLIP score\nwhich robustifies the CLIP objective by introducing random augmentation on\nimage. 2) a novel initialization and over-parameterization strategy for\noptimization which allows us to efficiently navigate the non-convex landscape\nin GAN space. 3) a composed generation technique which, by leveraging a novel\nbi-level optimization formulation, can compose multiple images to extend the\nGAN space and overcome the data-bias.\nWhen promoted by different input text, FuseDream can generate high-quality\nimages with varying objects, backgrounds, artistic styles, even novel\ncounterfactual concepts that do not appear in the training data of the GAN we\nuse. Quantitatively, the images generated by FuseDream yield top-level\nInception score and FID score on MS COCO dataset, without additional\narchitecture design or training.

Messages are\ncritical for software maintenance and program comprehension. Unlike documenting\nfeature updates and bug fixes, little is known about how developers document\ntheir refactoring activities. Developers can perform multiple refactoring\noperations, including moving methods, extracting classes, for various reasons.\nYet, there is no systematic study that analyzes the extent to which the\ndocumentation of refactoring accurately describes the refactoring operations\nperformed at the source code level. Therefore, this paper challenges the\nability of refactoring documentation to adequately predict the refactoring\ntypes, performed at the commit level. Our analysis relies on the text mining of\ncommit messages to extract the corresponding features that better represent\neach class. The extraction of text patterns, specific to each refactoring\nallows the design of a model that verifies the consistency of these patterns\nwith their corresponding refactoring. Such verification process can be achieved\nvia automatically predicting the method-level type of refactoring being\napplied, namely Extract Method, Inline Method, Move Method, Pull-up Method,\nPush-down Method, and Rename Method. We compared various classifiers, and a\nbaseline keyword-based approach, in terms of their prediction performance,\nusing a dataset of 5,004 commits. Our main findings show that the complexity of\nrefactoring type prediction varies from one type to another. Rename method and\nExtract method were found to be the best documented refactoring activities,\nwhile Pull-up Method and Push-down Method were the hardest to be identified via\ntextual descriptions.

    "abstract": "Assessing the quality of natural language generation systems through human\nannotation is very expensive. Additionally, human annotation campaigns are\ntime-consuming and include non-reusable human labour. In practice, researchers\nrely on automatic metrics as a proxy of quality. In the last decade, many\nstring-based metrics (e.g., BLEU) have been introduced. However, such metrics\nusually rely on exact matches and thus, do not robustly handle synonyms. In\nthis paper, we introduce InfoLM a family of untrained metrics that can be\nviewed as a string-based metric that addresses the aforementioned flaws thanks\nto a pre-trained masked language model. This family of metrics also makes use\nof information measures allowing the adaptation of InfoLM to various evaluation\ncriteria. Using direct assessment, we demonstrate that InfoLM achieves\nstatistically significant improvement and over $10$ points of correlation gains\nin many configurations on both summarization and data2text generation.",

The\ncollection of data science stages from acquisition, to cleaning/curation, to\nmodeling, and so on are referred to as data science pipelines. To facilitate\nresearch and practice on data science pipelines, it is essential to understand\ntheir nature. What are the typical stages of a data science pipeline? How are\nthey connected? Do the pipelines differ in the theoretical representations and\nthat in the practice? Today we do not fully understand these architectural\ncharacteristics of data science pipelines. In this work, we present a\nthree-pronged comprehensive study to answer this for the state-of-the-art, data\nscience in-the-small, and data science in-the-large. Our study analyzes three\ndatasets: a collection of 71 proposals for data science pipelines and related\nconcepts in theory, a collection of over 105 implementations of curated data\nscience pipelines from Kaggle competitions to understand data science\nin-the-small, and a collection of 21 mature data science projects from GitHub\nto understand data science in-the-large.

    "abstract": "In the online (time-series) search problem, a player is presented with a\nsequence of prices which are revealed in an online manner. In the standard\ndefinition of the problem, for each revealed price, the player must decide\nirrevocably whether to accept or reject it, without knowledge of future prices\n(other than an upper and a lower bound on their extreme values), and the\nobjective is to minimize the competitive ratio, namely the worst-case ratio\nbetween the maximum price in the sequence and the one selected by the player.\nThe problem formulates several applications of decision-making in the face of\nuncertainty on the revealed samples.\nPrevious work on this problem has largely assumed extreme scenarios in which\neither the player has almost no information about the input, or the player is\nprovided with some powerful, and error-free advice. In this work, we study\nlearning-augmented algorithms, in which there is a potentially erroneous\nprediction concerning the input. Specifically, we consider two different\nsettings: the setting in which the prediction is related to the maximum price\nin the sequence, as well as the setting in which the prediction is obtained as\na response to a number of binary queries. For both settings, we provide tight,\nor near-tight upper and lower bounds on the worst-case performance of search\nalgorithms as a function of the prediction error. We also provide experimental\nresults on data obtained from stock exchange markets that confirm the\ntheoretical analysis, and explain how our techniques can be applicable to other\nlearning-augmented applications.",

In \\ulamf, resources are sharply separated into linear\nand unrestricted; failures are explicit and arise following this separation. We\nequip \\ulamf with a type system based on non-idempotent intersection types,\nwhich controls resources and fail-prone computation. The target language is an\nexisting session-typed $\\pi$-calculus, s$\\pi$, which results from a\nCurry-Howard correspondence between linear logic and session types for\nconcurrency.

    "abstract": "For cyber-physical systems, finding a set of test cases with the least cost\nby exploring multiple goals is a complex task. For example, Arrieta et al.\nreported that state-of-the-art optimizers struggle to find minimal test suites\nfor this task. To better manage this task, we propose DoLesS (Domination with\nLeast Squares Approximation) which uses a domination predicate to sort the\nspace of possible goals to a small number of representative examples.\nMulti-objective domination then divides these examples into a \"best\" set and\nthe remaining \"rest\" set. After that, DoLesS applies an inverted least squares\napproximation approach to learn a minimal set of tests that can distinguish\nbest from rest in the reduced example space. DoLesS has been tested on four\ncyber-physical models: a tank flow model; a model of electric car windows; a\nsafety feature of an AC engine; and a continuous PID controller combined with a\ndiscrete state machine. Comparing to the recent state-of-the-art paper\nattempted the same task, DoLesS performs as well or even better as\nstate-of-the-art, while running 80-360 times faster on average (seconds instead\nof hours). Hence, we recommend DoLesSas a fast method to find minimal test\nsuites for multi-goal cyber-physical systems.

    "abstract": "Recently, RobustBench (Croce et al. 2020) has become a widely recognized\nbenchmark for the adversarial robustness of image classification networks. In\nits most commonly reported sub-task, RobustBench evaluates and ranks the\nadversarial robustness of trained neural networks on CIFAR10 under AutoAttack\n(Croce and Hein 2020b) with l-inf perturbations limited to eps = 8/255. With\nleading scores of the currently best performing models of around 60% of the\nbaseline, it is fair to characterize this benchmark to be quite challenging.\nDespite its general acceptance in recent literature, we aim to foster\ndiscussion about the suitability of RobustBench as a key indicator for\nrobustness which could be generalized to practical applications. Our line of\nargumentation against this is two-fold and supported by excessive experiments\npresented in this paper: We argue that I) the alternation of data by AutoAttack\nwith l-inf, eps = 8/255 is unrealistically strong, resulting in close to\nperfect detection rates of adversarial samples even by simple detection\nalgorithms and human observers. We also show that other attack methods are much\nharder to detect while achieving similar success rates. II) That results on\nlow-resolution data sets like CIFAR10 do not generalize well to higher\nresolution images as gradient-based attacks appear to become even more\ndetectable with increasing resolutions.",

    "abstract": "A cognitive architecture aimed at cumulative learning must provide the\nnecessary information and control structures to allow agents to learn\nincrementally and autonomously from their experience. This involves managing an\nagent's goals as well as continuously relating sensory information to these in\nits perception-cognition information stack. The more varied the environment of\na learning agent is, the more general and flexible must be these mechanisms to\nhandle a wider variety of relevant patterns, tasks, and goal structures. While\nmany researchers agree that information at different levels of abstraction\nlikely differs in its makeup and structure and processing mechanisms, agreement\non the particulars of such differences is not generally shared in the research\ncommunity. A binary processing architecture (often referred to as System-1 and\nSystem-2) has been proposed as a model of cognitive processing for low- and\nhigh-level information, respectively. We posit that cognition is not binary in\nthis way and that knowledge at any level of abstraction involves what we refer\nto as neurosymbolic information, meaning that data at both high and low levels\nmust contain both symbolic and subsymbolic information. Further, we argue that\nthe main differentiating factor between the processing of high and low levels\nof data abstraction can be largely attributed to the nature of the involved\nattention mechanisms.

    "abstract": "In many applications of computer vision it is important to accurately\nestimate the trajectory of an object over time by fusing data from a number of\nsources, of which 2D and 3D imagery is only one. In this paper, we show how to\nuse a deep feature encoding in conjunction with generative densities over the\nfeatures in a factor-graph based, probabilistic tracking framework. We present\na likelihood model that combines a learned feature encoder with generative\ndensities over them, both trained in a supervised manner. We also experiment\nwith directly inferring probability through the use of image classification\nmodels that feed into the likelihood formulation. These models are used to\nimplement deep factors that are added to the factor graph to complement other\nfactors that represent domain-specific knowledge such as motion models and/or\nother prior information. Factors are then optimized together in a non-linear\nleast-squares tracking framework that takes the form of an Extended Kalman\nSmoother with a Gaussian prior. A key feature of our likelihood model is that\nit leverages the Lie group properties of the tracked target's pose to apply the\nfeature encoding on an image patch, extracted through a differentiable warp\nfunction inspired by spatial transformer networks. To illustrate the proposed\napproach we evaluate it on a challenging social insect behavior dataset, and\nshow that using deep features does outperform these earlier linear appearance\nmodels used in this setting.",

    "abstract": "Label noise detection has been widely studied in Machine Learning because of\nits importance in improving training data quality. Satisfactory noise detection\nhas been achieved by adopting ensembles of classifiers. In this approach, an\ninstance is assigned as mislabeled if a high proportion of members in the pool\nmisclassifies it. Previous authors have empirically evaluated this approach;\nnevertheless, they mostly assumed that label noise is generated completely at\nrandom in a dataset. This is a strong assumption since other types of label\nnoise are feasible in practice and can influence noise detection results. This\nwork investigates the performance of ensemble noise detection under two\ndifferent noise models: the Noisy at Random (NAR), in which the probability of\nlabel noise depends on the instance class, in comparison to the Noisy\nCompletely at Random model, in which the probability of label noise is entirely\nindependent. In this setting, we investigate the effect of class distribution\non noise detection performance since it changes the total noise level observed\nin a dataset under the NAR assumption. Further, an evaluation of the ensemble\nvote threshold is conducted to contrast with the most common approaches in the\nliterature. In many performed experiments, choosing a noise generation model\nover another can lead to different results when considering aspects such as\nclass imbalance and noise level ratio among different classes.",

Fokas, to solve initial-boundary-value problems for linear evolution\npartial differential equations with constant coefficients on the finite\ninterval $x \\in (0,L)$. The semidiscrete method is applied to various spatial\ndiscretizations of several first and second-order linear equations, producing\nthe exact solution for the semidiscrete problem, given appropriate initial and\nboundary data. From these solutions, we derive alternative series\nrepresentations that are better suited for numerical computations. In addition,\nwe show how the Unified Transform Method treats derivative boundary conditions\nand ghost points introduced by the choice of discretization stencil and we\npropose the notion of \"natural\" discretizations. We consider the continuum\nlimit of the semidiscrete solutions and compare with standard finite-difference\nschemes.",

    "abstract": "The notion of Attack Surface refers to the critical points on the boundary of\na software system which are accessible from outside or contain valuable content\nfor attackers. The ability to identify attack surface components of software\nsystem has a significant role in effectiveness of vulnerability analysis\napproaches. Most prior works focus on vulnerability techniques that use an\napproximation of attack surfaces and there has not been many attempt to create\na comprehensive list of attack surface components. Although limited number of\nstudies have focused on attack surface analysis, they defined attack surface\ncomponents based on project specific hypotheses to evaluate security risk of\nspecific types of software applications. In this study, we leverage a\nqualitative analysis approach to empirically identify an extensive list of\nattack surface components. To this end, we conduct a Grounded Theory (GT)\nanalysis on 1444 previously published vulnerability reports and weaknesses with\na team of three software developers and security experts. We extract\nvulnerability information from two publicly available repositories: 1) Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures, and 2) Common Weakness Enumeration. We ask three\nkey questions: where the attacks come from, what they target, and how they\nemerge, and to help answer these questions we define three core categories for\nattack surface components: Entry points, Targets, and Mechanisms. We extract\nattack surface concepts related to each category from collected vulnerability\ninformation using the GT analysis and provide a comprehensive categorization\nthat represents attack surface components of software systems from various\nperspectives. The comparison of the proposed attack surface model with the\nliterature shows in the best case previous works cover only 50% of the attack\nsurface components at network level and only 6.7% of the components at code\nlevel.",

    "abstract": "Distributed deep learning frameworks like federated learning (FL) and its\nvariants are enabling personalized experiences across a wide range of web\nclients and mobile/IoT devices. However, FL-based frameworks are constrained by\ncomputational resources at clients due to the exploding growth of model\nparameters (eg. billion parameter model). Split learning (SL), a recent\nframework, reduces client compute load by splitting the model training between\nclient and server. This flexibility is extremely useful for low-compute setups\nbut is often achieved at cost of increase in bandwidth consumption and may\nresult in sub-optimal convergence, especially when client data is\nheterogeneous. In this work, we introduce AdaSplit which enables efficiently\nscaling SL to low resource scenarios by reducing bandwidth consumption and\nimproving performance across heterogeneous clients. To capture and benchmark\nthis multi-dimensional nature of distributed deep learning, we also introduce\nC3-Score, a metric to evaluate performance under resource budgets. We validate\nthe effectiveness of AdaSplit under limited resources through extensive\nexperimental comparison with strong federated and split learning baselines. We\nalso present a sensitivity analysis of key design choices in AdaSplit which\nvalidates the ability of AdaSplit to provide adaptive trade-offs across\nvariable resource budgets.",

It can help identify the\ncomponents, within a legacy software application, according to the\napplication's architectural pattern. It is useful to identify architectural\ntechnical debt. We are interested in identifying layers within a layered\napplication since the layered pattern is one of the most used patterns to\nstructure large systems. Earlier component reconstruction work focusing on that\npattern relied on generic component identification criteria, such as cohesion\nand coupling. Recent work has identified architectural-pattern specific\ncriteria to identify components within that pattern. However, the\narchitectural-pattern specific criteria that the layered pattern embodies are\nloosely defined. In this paper, we present a first systematic literature review\n(SLR) of the literature aiming at inventorying such criteria for layers within\nlegacy applications and grouping them under four principles that embody the\nfundamental design principles under-lying the architectural pattern. We\nidentify six such criteria in the form of design rules. We also perform a\nsecond systematic literature review to synthesize the literature on software\narchitecture reconstruction in the light of these criteria. We report those\nprinciples, the rules they encompass, their representation, and their usage in\nsoftware architecture reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "PCM is a popular backing memory for DRAM main memory in tiered memory\nsystems. PCM has asymmetric access energy; writes dominate reads. MLC asymmetry\ncan vary by an order of magnitude. Many schemes have been developed to take\nadvantage of the asymmetric patterns of 0s and 1s in the data to reduce write\nenergy. Because the memory is non-volatile, data can be recovered via physical\nattack or across system reboot cycles. To protect information stored in PCM\nagainst these attacks requires encryption. Unfortunately, most encryption\nalgorithms scramble 0s and 1s in the data, effectively removing any patterns\nand negatively impacting schemes that leverage data bias and similarity to\nreduce write energy. In this paper, we introduce Virtual Coset Coding (VCC) as\na workload-independent approach that reduces costly symbol transitions for\nstoring encrypted data. VCC is based on two ideas. First, using coset encoding\nwith random coset candidates, it is possible to effectively reduce the\nfrequency of costly bit/symbol transitions when writing encrypted data. Second,\na small set of random substrings can be used to achieve the same encoding\nefficiency as a large number of random coset candidates, but at a much lower\nencoding/decoding cost. Additionally, we demonstrate how VCC can be leveraged\nfor energy reduction in combination with fault-mitigation and fault-tolerance\nto dramatically increase the lifetimes of endurance-limited NVMs, such as PCM.\nWe evaluate the design of VCC and demonstrate that it can be implemented\non-chip with only a nominal area overhead. VCC reduces dynamic energy by 22-28%\nwhile maintaining the same performance. Using our multi-objective optimization\napproach achieves at least a 36% improvement in lifetime over the\nstate-of-the-art and at least a 50% improvement in lifetime vs. an unencoded\nmemory, while maintaining its energy savings and system performance.",

    "abstract": "Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize novel classes by transferring\nsemantic knowledge from seen classes to unseen ones. Semantic knowledge is\nlearned from attribute descriptions shared between different classes, which act\nas strong priors for localizing object attributes that represent discriminative\nregion features, enabling significant visual-semantic interaction. Although\nsome attention-based models have attempted to learn such region features in a\nsingle image, the transferability and discriminative attribute localization of\nvisual features are typically neglected. In this paper, we propose an\nattribute-guided Transformer network, termed TransZero, to refine visual\nfeatures and learn attribute localization for discriminative visual embedding\nrepresentations in ZSL. Specifically, TransZero takes a feature augmentation\nencoder to alleviate the cross-dataset bias between ImageNet and ZSL\nbenchmarks, and improves the transferability of visual features by reducing the\nentangled relative geometry relationships among region features. To learn\nlocality-augmented visual features, TransZero employs a visual-semantic decoder\nto localize the image regions most relevant to each attribute in a given image,\nunder the guidance of semantic attribute information. Then, the\nlocality-augmented visual features and semantic vectors are used to conduct\neffective visual-semantic interaction in a visual-semantic embedding network.\nExtensive experiments show that TransZero achieves the new state of the art on\nthree ZSL benchmarks.

    "title": "Make A Long Image Short: Adaptive Token Length for Vision Transformers",
    "abstract": "The vision transformer splits each image into a sequence of tokens with fixed\nlength and processes the tokens in the same way as words in natural language\nprocessing. More tokens normally lead to better performance but considerably\nincreased computational cost. Motivated by the proverb \"A picture is worth a\nthousand words\" we aim to accelerate the ViT model by making a long image\nshort. To this end, we propose a novel approach to assign token length\nadaptively during inference. Specifically, we first train a ViT model, called\nResizable-ViT (ReViT), that can process any given input with diverse token\nlengths. Then, we retrieve the \"token-length label\" from ReViT and use it to\ntrain a lightweight Token-Length Assigner (TLA). The token-length labels are\nthe smallest number of tokens to split an image that the ReViT can make the\ncorrect prediction, and TLA is learned to allocate the optimal token length\nbased on these labels. The TLA enables the ReViT to process the image with the\nminimum sufficient number of tokens during inference. Thus, the inference speed\nis boosted by reducing the token numbers in the ViT model. Our approach is\ngeneral and compatible with modern vision transformer architectures and can\nsignificantly reduce computational expanse. We verified the effectiveness of\nour methods on multiple representative ViT models (DeiT, LV-ViT, and\nTimesFormer) across two tasks (image classification and action recognition).",

    "abstract": "Advanced manufacturing techniques have enabled the production of materials\nwith state-of-the-art properties. In many cases however, the development of\nphysics-based models of these techniques lags behind their use in the lab. This\nmeans that designing and running experiments proceeds largely via trial and\nerror. This is sub-optimal since experiments are cost-, time-, and\nlabor-intensive. In this work we propose a machine learning framework,\ndifferential property classification (DPC), which enables an experimenter to\nleverage machine learning's unparalleled pattern matching capability to pursue\ndata-driven experimental design. DPC takes two possible experiment parameter\nsets and outputs a prediction of which will produce a material with a more\ndesirable property specified by the operator. We demonstrate the success of DPC\non AA7075 tube manufacturing process and mechanical property data using shear\nassisted processing and extrusion (ShAPE), a solid phase processing technology.\nWe show that by focusing on the experimenter's need to choose between multiple\ncandidate experimental parameters, we can reframe the challenging regression\ntask of predicting material properties from processing parameters, into a\nclassification task on which machine learning models can achieve good\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce an inverse averaging finite element method (IAFEM)\nfor solving the size-modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck (SMPNP) equations.\nComparing with the classical Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations, the SMPNP\nequations add a nonlinear term to each of the Nernst-Planck (NP) fluxes to\ndescribe the steric repulsion which can treat multiple nonuniform particle\nsizes in simulations. Since the new terms include sums and gradients of ion\nconcentrations, the nonlinear coupling of SMPNP equations is much stronger than\nthat of PNP equations. By introducing a generalized Slotboom transform, each of\nthe size-modified NP equation is transformed into a self-adjoint equation with\nexponentially behaved coefficient, which has similar simple form to the\nstandard NP equation with the Slotboom transformation. This treatment enables\nemploying our recently developed inverse averaging technique to deal with the\nexponential coefficients of the reformulated formulations, featured with\nadvantages of numerical stability and flux conservation especially in strong\nnonlinear and convection-dominated cases. Comparing with previous stabilization\nmethods, the IAFEM proposed in this paper can still possess the numerical\nstability when dealing with convection-dominated problems. And it is more\nconcise and easier to be numerically implemented. Numerical experiments about a\nmodel problem with analytic solutions are presented to verify the accuracy and\norder of IAFEM for SMPNP equations. Studies about the size-effects of a sphere\nmodel and an ion channel system are presented to show that our IAFEM is more\neffective and robust than the traditional finite element method (FEM) when\nsolving SMPNP equations in simulations of biological systems.",

While for video domains, how to effectively\nmodel temporal context with the attention of object instances across frames\nremains an open problem. In this paper, we propose an online video instance\nsegmentation framework with a novel instance-aware temporal fusion method. We\nfirst leverages the representation, i.e., a latent code in the global context\n(instance code) and CNN feature maps to represent instance- and pixel-level\nfeatures. Based on this representation, we introduce a cropping-free temporal\nfusion approach to model the temporal consistency between video frames.\nSpecifically, we encode global instance-specific information in the instance\ncode and build up inter-frame contextual fusion with hybrid attentions between\nthe instance codes and CNN feature maps. Inter-frame consistency between the\ninstance codes are further enforced with order constraints. By leveraging the\nlearned hybrid temporal consistency, we are able to directly retrieve and\nmaintain instance identities across frames, eliminating the complicated\nframe-wise instance matching in prior methods. Extensive experiments have been\nconducted on popular VIS datasets, i.e. Youtube-VIS-19/21. Our model achieves\nthe best performance among all online VIS methods.

However, those approaches introduce\ninformation redundancy when fusing features and are inefficient without\nconsidering the complementarity of modalities. In this paper, we propose an\nefficient neural network to learn modality-fused representations with\nCB-Transformer (LMR-CBT) for multimodal emotion recognition from unaligned\nmultimodal sequences. Specifically, we first perform feature extraction for the\nthree modalities respectively to obtain the local structure of the sequences.\nThen, we design a novel transformer with cross-modal blocks (CB-Transformer)\nthat enables complementary learning of different modalities, mainly divided\ninto local temporal learning,cross-modal feature fusion and global\nself-attention representations. In addition, we splice the fused features with\nthe original features to classify the emotions of the sequences. Finally, we\nconduct word-aligned and unaligned experiments on three challenging datasets,\nIEMOCAP, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI.

To address this issue, we propose\na simple yet surprisingly powerful data augmentation and training scheme we\ncall Learning to Detect Every Thing (LDET). To avoid suppressing hidden\nobjects, background objects that are visible but unlabeled, we paste annotated\nobjects on a background image sampled from a small region of the original\nimage.

    "abstract": "Classical machine learners are designed only to tackle one task without\ncapability of adopting new emerging tasks or classes whereas such capacity is\nmore practical and human-like in the real world. To address this shortcoming,\ncontinual machine learners are elaborated to commendably learn a stream of\ntasks with domain and class shifts among different tasks. In this paper, we\npropose a general feature-propagation based contrastive continual learning\nmethod which is capable of handling multiple continual learning scenarios.\nSpecifically, we align the current and previous representation spaces by means\nof feature propagation and contrastive representation learning to bridge the\ndomain shifts among distinct tasks. To further mitigate the class-wise shifts\nof the feature representation, a supervised contrastive loss is exploited to\nmake the example embeddings of the same class closer than those of different\nclasses. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the outstanding\nperformance of the proposed method on six continual learning benchmarks\ncompared to a group of cutting-edge continual learning methods.",

In the first method, we define three structural\nfeatures in the feature space: feature angle, feature distance, and relational\nembedding. The second method aggregates the node-wise features of multi-hop\nneighbors in a GC. Both methods can be simultaneously used.

    "abstract": "Multi-label learning predicts a subset of labels from a given label set for\nan unseen instance while considering label correlations. A known challenge with\nmulti-label classification is the long-tailed distribution of labels. Many\nstudies focus on improving the overall predictions of the model and thus do not\nprioritise tail-end labels. Improving the tail-end label predictions in\nmulti-label classifications of medical text enables the potential to understand\npatients better and improve care. The knowledge gained by one or more\ninfrequent labels can impact the cause of medical decisions and treatment\nplans. This research presents variations of concatenated domain-specific\nlanguage models, including multi-BioMed-Transformers, to achieve two primary\ngoals. First, to improve F1 scores of infrequent labels across multi-label\nproblems, especially with long-tail labels; second, to handle long medical text\nand multi-sourced electronic health records (EHRs), a challenging task for\nstandard transformers designed to work on short input sequences. A vital\ncontribution of this research is new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results obtained\nusing TransformerXL for predicting medical codes. A variety of experiments are\nperformed on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III)\ndatabase. Results show that concatenated BioMed-Transformers outperform\nstandard transformers in terms of overall micro and macro F1 scores and\nindividual F1 scores of tail-end labels, while incurring lower training times\nthan existing transformer-based solutions for long input sequences.",

    "abstract": "Learning and generalizing from limited examples, i,e, few-shot learning, is\nof core importance to many real-world vision applications. A principal way of\nachieving few-shot learning is to realize an embedding where samples from\ndifferent classes are distinctive. Recent studies suggest that embedding via\nhyperbolic geometry enjoys low distortion for hierarchical and structured data,\nmaking it suitable for few-shot learning. In this paper, we propose to learn a\ncontext-aware hyperbolic metric to characterize the distance between a point\nand a set associated with a learned set to set distance. To this end, we\nformulate the metric as a weighted sum on the tangent bundle of the hyperbolic\nspace and develop a mechanism to obtain the weights adaptively and based on the\nconstellation of the points. This not only makes the metric local but also\ndependent on the task in hand, meaning that the metric will adapt depending on\nthe samples that it compares. We empirically show that such metric yields\nrobustness in the presence of outliers and achieves a tangible improvement over\nbaseline models. This includes the state-of-the-art results on five popular\nfew-shot classification benchmarks, namely mini-ImageNet, tiered-ImageNet,\nCaltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB), CIFAR-FS, and FC100.",

    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL)-based malware detectors are increasingly adopted for early\ndetection of malicious behavior in cybersecurity. However, their sensitivity to\nadversarial malware variants has raised immense security concerns. Generating\nsuch adversarial variants by the defender is crucial to improving the\nresistance of DL-based malware detectors against them. This necessity has given\nrise to an emerging stream of machine learning research, Adversarial Malware\nexample Generation (AMG), which aims to generate evasive adversarial malware\nvariants that preserve the malicious functionality of a given malware. Within\nAMG research, black-box method has gained more attention than white-box\nmethods. However, most black-box AMG methods require numerous interactions with\nthe malware detectors to generate adversarial malware examples. Given that most\nmalware detectors enforce a query limit, this could result in generating\nnon-realistic adversarial examples that are likely to be detected in practice\ndue to lack of stealth. In this study, we show that a novel DL-based causal\nlanguage model enables single-shot evasion (i.e., with only one query to\nmalware detector) by treating the content of the malware executable as a byte\nsequence and training a Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT). Our proposed\nmethod, MalGPT, significantly outperformed the leading benchmark methods on a\nreal-world malware dataset obtained from VirusTotal, achieving over 24.51\\%\nevasion rate.

In this paper, we aim\nto develop a protocol to automatically synthesize micro-expression training\ndata that 1) are on a large scale and 2) allow us to train recognition models\nwith strong accuracy on real-world test sets.

Micro-expression recognition\nmodels are trained on the generated micro-expression datasets and evaluated on\nreal-world test sets, where very competitive and stable performance is\nobtained.

As\nmultiple sensory already create a perception of the environment, an\ninvestigation into the advantages of ISAC compare to such modalities is\nrequired. Therefore, we introduce MaxRay, an ISAC framework allowing to\nsimulate communication, sensing, and additional sensory jointly. Emphasizing\nthe challenges for creating such sensing networks, we introduce the required\npropagation properties for sensing and how they are leveraged. To compare the\nperformance of the different sensing techniques, we analyze four commonly used\nmetrics used in different fields and evaluate their advantages and\ndisadvantages for sensing. We depict that a metric based on prominence is\nsuitable to cover most algorithms. Further we highlight the requirement of\nclutter removal algorithms, using two standard clutter removal techniques to\ndetect a target in a typical industrial scenario.

Recent work on\nprobing pre-trained language models uncovered a wide range of linguistic\nproperties encoded in their contextualized representations.

We propose a methodology for probing linguistic information\nfor logical inference in pre-trained language model representations. Our\nprobing datasets cover a list of linguistic phenomena required by major\nsymbolic inference systems. We find that (i) pre-trained language models do\nencode several types of linguistic information for inference, but there are\nalso some types of information that are weakly encoded, (ii) language models\ncan effectively learn missing linguistic information through fine-tuning.\nOverall, our findings provide insights into which aspects of linguistic\ninformation for logical inference do language models and their pre-training\nprocedures capture.

We propose a mandarin keyword spotting system\n(KWS) with several novel and effective improvements, including a big backbone\n(B) model, a keyword biasing (B) mechanism and the introduction of syllable\nmodeling units (S). By considering this, we term the total system BBS-KWS as an\nabbreviation. The BBS-KWS system consists of an end-to-end automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) module and a KWS module. The ASR module converts speech\nfeatures to text representations, which applies a big backbone network to the\nacoustic model and takes syllable modeling units into consideration as well. In\naddition, the keyword biasing mechanism is used to improve the recall rate of\nkeywords in the ASR inference stage. The KWS module applies multiple criteria\nto determine the absence or presence of the keywords, such as multi-stage\nmatching, fuzzy matching, and connectionist temporal classification (CTC)\nprefix score. To further improve our system, we conduct semi-supervised\nlearning on the CN-Celeb dataset for better generalization.

While producing images at arbitrary scales, NeRF\nstruggles with resolutions that go beyond observed images. Our key insight is\nthat NeRF has a local prior, which means predictions of a 3D point can be\npropagated in the nearby region and remain accurate.

Then, we show that NeRF-SR\ncan further boost the performance of super-sampling by a refinement network\nthat leverages the estimated depth at hand to hallucinate details from related\npatches on an HR reference image.

Furthermore, by exploiting known SAT orbiting patterns, eRACH\ndoes not require central coordination or additional communication across users,\nwhile training convergence is stabilized through the regular orbiting patterns.\nCompared to RACH, we show from various simulations that our proposed eRACH\nyields 54.6% higher average network throughput with around two times lower\naverage access delay while achieving 0.989 Jain's fairness index.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based methods for low-light image enhancement typically require\nenormous paired training data, which are impractical to capture in real-world\nscenarios. Recently, unsupervised approaches have been explored to eliminate\nthe reliance on paired training data. However, they perform erratically in\ndiverse real-world scenarios due to the absence of priors. To address this\nissue, we propose an unsupervised low-light image enhancement method based on\nan effective prior termed histogram equalization prior (HEP). Our work is\ninspired by the interesting observation that the feature maps of histogram\nequalization enhanced image and the ground truth are similar. Specifically, we\nformulate the HEP to provide abundant texture and luminance information.\nEmbedded into a Light Up Module (LUM), it helps to decompose the low-light\nimages into illumination and reflectance maps, and the reflectance maps can be\nregarded as restored images. However, the derivation based on Retinex theory\nreveals that the reflectance maps are contaminated by noise. We introduce a\nNoise Disentanglement Module (NDM) to disentangle the noise and content in the\nreflectance maps with the reliable aid of unpaired clean images. Guided by the\nhistogram equalization prior and noise disentanglement, our method can recover\nfiner details and is more capable to suppress noise in real-world low-light\nscenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs favorably\nagainst the state-of-the-art unsupervised low-light enhancement algorithms and\neven matches the state-of-the-art supervised algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Four-variable-independent-regression localization losses, such as\nSmooth-$\\ell_1$ Loss, are used by default in modern detectors. Nevertheless,\nthis kind of loss is oversimplified so that it is inconsistent with the final\nevaluation metric, intersection over union (IoU). Directly employing the\nstandard IoU is also not infeasible, since the constant-zero plateau in the\ncase of non-overlapping boxes and the non-zero gradient at the minimum may make\nit not trainable. Accordingly, we propose a systematic method to address these\nproblems. Firstly, we propose a new metric, the extended IoU (EIoU), which is\nwell-defined when two boxes are not overlapping and reduced to the standard IoU\nwhen overlapping. Secondly, we present the convexification technique (CT) to\nconstruct a loss on the basis of EIoU, which can guarantee the gradient at the\nminimum to be zero. Thirdly, we propose a steady optimization technique (SOT)\nto make the fractional EIoU loss approaching the minimum more steadily and\nsmoothly. Fourthly, to fully exploit the capability of the EIoU based loss, we\nintroduce an interrelated IoU-predicting head to further boost localization\naccuracy.

    "title": "Global Context with Discrete Diffusion in Vector Quantised Modelling for  Image Generation",
    "abstract": "The integration of Vector Quantised Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) with\nautoregressive models as generation part has yielded high-quality results on\nimage generation. However, the autoregressive models will strictly follow the\nprogressive scanning order during the sampling phase. This leads the existing\nVQ series models to hardly escape the trap of lacking global information.\nDenoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) in the continuous domain have\nshown a capability to capture the global context, while generating high-quality\nimages. In the discrete state space, some works have demonstrated the potential\nto perform text generation and low resolution image generation. We show that\nwith the help of a content-rich discrete visual codebook from VQ-VAE, the\ndiscrete diffusion model can also generate high fidelity images with global\ncontext, which compensates for the deficiency of the classical autoregressive\nmodel along pixel space. Meanwhile, the integration of the discrete VAE with\nthe diffusion model resolves the drawback of conventional autoregressive models\nbeing oversized, and the diffusion model which demands excessive time in the\nsampling process when generating images. It is found that the quality of the\ngenerated images is heavily dependent on the discrete visual codebook.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Vector Quantised Discrete\nDiffusion Model (VQ-DDM) is able to achieve comparable performance to top-tier\nmethods with low complexity. It also demonstrates outstanding advantages over\nother vectors quantised with autoregressive models in terms of image inpainting\ntasks without additional training.",

    "title": "A Survey: Deep Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification with Few  Labeled Samples",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of deep learning technology and improvement in\ncomputing capability, deep learning has been widely used in the field of\nhyperspectral image (HSI) classification. In general, deep learning models\noften contain many trainable parameters and require a massive number of labeled\nsamples to achieve optimal performance. However, in regard to HSI\nclassification, a large number of labeled samples is generally difficult to\nacquire due to the difficulty and time-consuming nature of manual labeling.\nTherefore, many research works focus on building a deep learning model for HSI\nclassification with few labeled samples. In this article, we concentrate on\nthis topic and provide a systematic review of the relevant literature.\nSpecifically, the contributions of this paper are twofold. First, the research\nprogress of related methods is categorized according to the learning paradigm,\nincluding transfer learning, active learning and few-shot learning. Second, a\nnumber of experiments with various state-of-the-art approaches has been carried\nout, and the results are summarized to reveal the potential research\ndirections. More importantly, it is notable that although there is a vast gap\nbetween deep learning models (that usually need sufficient labeled samples) and\nthe HSI scenario with few labeled samples, the issues of small-sample sets can\nbe well characterized by fusion of deep learning methods and related\ntechniques, such as transfer learning and a lightweight model. For\nreproducibility, the source codes of the methods assessed in the paper can be\nfound at https://github.com/ShuGuoJ/HSI-Classification.git.",

    "abstract": "Geometric feature learning for 3D meshes is central to computer graphics and\nhighly important for numerous vision applications. However, deep learning\ncurrently lags in hierarchical modeling of heterogeneous 3D meshes due to the\nlack of required operations and/or their efficient implementations. In this\npaper, we propose a series of modular operations for effective geometric deep\nlearning over heterogeneous 3D meshes. These operations include mesh\nconvolutions, (un)pooling and efficient mesh decimation. We provide open source\nimplementation of these operations, collectively termed \\textit{Picasso}. The\nmesh decimation module of Picasso is GPU-accelerated, which can process a batch\nof meshes on-the-fly for deep learning. Our (un)pooling operations compute\nfeatures for newly-created neurons across network layers of varying resolution.\nOur mesh convolutions include facet2vertex, vertex2facet, and facet2facet\nconvolutions that exploit vMF mixture and Barycentric interpolation to\nincorporate fuzzy modelling. Leveraging the modular operations of Picasso, we\ncontribute a novel hierarchical neural network, PicassoNet-II, to learn highly\ndiscriminative features from 3D meshes. PicassoNet-II accepts primitive\ngeometrics and fine textures of mesh facets as input features, while processing\nfull scene meshes. Our network achieves highly competitive performance for\nshape analysis and scene parsing on a variety of benchmarks.

It has been tackled by different\napproaches such as similarity retrieval, sequence-to-sequence modeling and\ngenerative adversarial networks, but their generated dance sequences are often\nshort of motion realism, diversity and music consistency. In this paper, we\npropose a Music-to-Dance with Optimal Transport Network (MDOT-Net) for learning\nto generate 3D dance choreographs from music. We introduce an optimal transport\ndistance for evaluating the authenticity of the generated dance distribution\nand a Gromov-Wasserstein distance to measure the correspondence between the\ndance distribution and the input music. This gives a well defined and\nnon-divergent training objective that mitigates the limitation of standard GAN\ntraining which is frequently plagued with instability and divergent generator\nloss issues.

    "abstract": "Recently simulation methods have been developed for optical tactile sensors\nto enable the Sim2Real learning, i.e., firstly training models in simulation\nbefore deploying them on the real robot. However, some artefacts in the real\nobjects are unpredictable, such as imperfections caused by fabrication\nprocesses, or scratches by the natural wear and tear, and thus cannot be\nrepresented in the simulation, resulting in a significant gap between the\nsimulated and real tactile images. To address this Sim2Real gap, we propose a\nnovel texture generation network that maps the simulated images into\nphotorealistic tactile images that resemble a real sensor contacting a real\nimperfect object. Each simulated tactile image is first divided into two types\nof regions: areas that are in contact with the object and areas that are not.\nThe former is applied with generated textures learned from real textures in the\nreal tactile images, whereas the latter maintains its appearance as when the\nsensor is not in contact with any object. This makes sure that the artefacts\nare only applied to the deformed regions of the sensor. Our extensive\nexperiments show that the proposed texture generation network can generate\nthese realistic artefacts on the deformed regions of the sensor, while avoiding\nleaking the textures into areas of no contact. Quantitative experiments further\nreveal that when using the adapted images generated by our proposed network for\na Sim2Real classification task, the drop in accuracy caused by the Sim2Real gap\nis reduced from 38.43% to merely 0.81%. As such, this work has the potential to\naccelerate the Sim2Real learning for robotic tasks requiring tactile sensing.",

    "abstract": "In fractured poroelastic media under high differential stress, the shearing\nof fractures and faults and the corresponding propagation of wing cracks can be\ninduced by fluid injection. Focusing on low-pressure stimulation with fluid\npressures below the minimum principal stress but above the threshold required\nto overcome the fracture's frictional resistance to slip, this paper presents a\nmathematical model and a numerical solution approach for coupling fluid flow\nwith fracture shearing and propagation. Numerical challenges are related to the\nstrong coupling between hydraulic and mechanical processes, the material\ndiscontinuity the fractures represent in the medium, the wide range of spatial\nscales involved, and the strong effect that fracture deformation and\npropagation have on the physical processes. The solution approach is based on a\nmultiscale strategy. In the macroscale model, flow in and poroelastic\ndeformation of the matrix are coupled with the flow in the fractures and\nfracture contact mechanics, allowing fractures to frictionally slide. Fracture\npropagation is handled at the microscale, where the maximum tangential stress\ncriterion triggers the propagation of fractures, and Paris' law governs the\nfracture growth processes. Simulations show how the shearing of a fracture due\nto fluid injection is linked to fracture propagation, including cases with\nhydraulically and mechanically interacting fractures.",

To help test the correctness of ASRS, we propose\ntechniques that automatically generate blackbox (agnostic to the DNN),\nuntargeted adversarial attacks that are portable across ASRs.

We evaluate portability and effectiveness\nof our techniques using three popular ASRs and three input audio datasets using\nthe metrics - WER of output text, Similarity to original audio and attack\nSuccess Rate on different ASRs.

While cameras, Lidars and other remote sensors\ncan assess a scene globally and instantly, tactile sensors can reduce their\nmeasurement uncertainties and gain information about the local physical\ninteractions between the in-contact objects and the robot, that are often not\naccessible via remote sensing. Tactile sensors can be grouped into two main\ncategories: electronic tactile skins and camera based optical tactile sensors.\nThe former are slim and can be fitted to different body parts, whereas the\nlatter assume a more prismatic shape and have much higher sensing resolutions,\noffering a good advantage for being used as robotic fingers or fingertips. One\nof such optical tactile sensors is our GelTip sensor that is shaped as a finger\nand can sense contacts on any location of its surface. As such, the GelTip\nsensor is able to detect contacts from all the directions, like a human finger.\nTo capture these contacts, it uses a camera installed at its base to track the\ndeformations of the opaque elastomer that covers its hollow, rigid and\ntransparent body. Thanks to this design, a gripper equipped with GelTip sensors\nis capable of simultaneously monitoring contacts happening inside and outside\nits grasp closure. Experiments carried out using this sensor demonstrate how\ncontacts can be localised, and more importantly, the advantages, and even\npossibly a necessity, of leveraging all-around touch sensing in dexterous\nmanipulation tasks in clutter where contacts may happen at any location of the\nfinger.

We discovered that when equipped with the same transformer, their\ntwo-stage counterparts can be more performant and memory-efficient, while\ntaking a fraction of the time to train. In this work, we propose the\nUnary-Pairwise Transformer, a two-stage detector that exploits unary and\npairwise representations for HOIs. We observe that the unary and pairwise parts\nof our transformer network specialise, with the former preferentially\nincreasing the scores of positive examples and the latter decreasing the scores\nof negative examples. We evaluate our method on the HICO-DET and V-COCO\ndatasets, and significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches. At\ninference time, our model with ResNet50 approaches real-time performance on a\nsingle GPU.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised person re-identification (Re-ID) attracts increasing attention\ndue to its potential to resolve the scalability problem of supervised Re-ID\nmodels. Most existing unsupervised methods adopt an iterative clustering\nmechanism, where the network was trained based on pseudo labels generated by\nunsupervised clustering. However, clustering errors are inevitable. To generate\nhigh-quality pseudo-labels and mitigate the impact of clustering errors, we\npropose a novel clustering relationship modeling framework for unsupervised\nperson Re-ID. Specifically, before clustering, the relation between unlabeled\nimages is explored based on a graph correlation learning (GCL) module and the\nrefined features are then used for clustering to generate high-quality\npseudo-labels.Thus, GCL adaptively mines the relationship between samples in a\nmini-batch to reduce the impact of abnormal clustering when training. To train\nthe network more effectively, we further propose a selective contrastive\nlearning (SCL) method with a selective memory bank update policy. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method shows much better results than most\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised methods on Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17\ndatasets. We will release the code for model reproduction.",

    "abstract": "For a long time, the point cloud completion task has been regarded as a pure\ngeneration task. After obtaining the global shape code through the encoder, a\ncomplete point cloud is generated using the shape priorly learnt by the\nnetworks. However, such models are undesirably biased towards prior average\nobjects and inherently limited to fit geometry details. In this paper, we\npropose a Graph-Guided Deformation Network, which respectively regards the\ninput data and intermediate generation as controlling and supporting points,\nand models the optimization guided by a graph convolutional network(GCN) for\nthe point cloud completion task. Our key insight is to simulate the least\nsquare Laplacian deformation process via mesh deformation methods, which brings\nadaptivity for modeling variation in geometry details. By this means, we also\nreduce the gap between the completion task and the mesh deformation algorithms.\nAs far as we know, we are the first to refine the point cloud completion task\nby mimicing traditional graphics algorithms with GCN-guided deformation. We\nhave conducted extensive experiments on both the simulated indoor dataset\nShapeNet, outdoor dataset KITTI, and our self-collected autonomous driving\ndataset Pandar40.

    "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) based on multi-modal approach has been\nrecently shown to improve the accuracy performance of HAR. However, restricted\ncomputational resources associated with wearable devices, i.e., smartwatch,\nfailed to directly support such advanced methods. To tackle this issue, this\nstudy introduces an end-to-end Vision-to-Sensor Knowledge Distillation (VSKD)\nframework. In this VSKD framework, only time-series data, i.e., accelerometer\ndata, is needed from wearable devices during the testing phase. Therefore, this\nframework will not only reduce the computational demands on edge devices, but\nalso produce a learning model that closely matches the performance of the\ncomputational expensive multi-modal approach. In order to retain the local\ntemporal relationship and facilitate visual deep learning models, we first\nconvert time-series data to two-dimensional images by applying the Gramian\nAngular Field ( GAF) based encoding method. We adopted ResNet18 and multi-scale\nTRN with BN-Inception as teacher and student network in this study,\nrespectively. A novel loss function, named Distance and Angle-wised Semantic\nKnowledge loss (DASK), is proposed to mitigate the modality variations between\nthe vision and the sensor domain. Extensive experimental results on UTD-MHAD,\nMMAct, and Berkeley-MHAD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and\ncompetitiveness of the proposed VSKD model which can deployed on wearable\nsensors.",

One way to handle\nthis problem is lifting the 2-dimensional time-frequency representation to a\n3-dimensional representation, called time-frequency-chirp rate (TFC)\nrepresentation, by adding one extra chirp rate parameter so that crossover\nfrequencies are disentangles in higher dimension. The chirplet transform is an\nalgorithm for this lifting idea. However, in practice we found that it has a\nstronger \"blurring\" effect in the chirp rate axis, which limits its application\nin real world data. Moreover, to our knowledge, we have limited mathematical\nunderstanding of the chirplet transform in the literature. Motivated by real\nworld data challenges, in this paper, we propose the synchrosqueezed chirplet\ntransform (SCT) that gives a concentrated TFC representation that the contrast\nis enhanced so that one can distinguish different modes even with crossover\ninstantaneous frequencies.

In these studies, acquisition of the VSC's PSS\nconditions is a necessary precondition for proper linearization and stability\nanalysis, and the efficiency of this process is particularly important for\nparametric studies. To this end, this work develops a computational method for\nautomating the LTP analyses of VSCs with an integrated PSS solver. The core of\nthe method lies in a unified frequency-domain iteration process that is\ndeveloped by applying the generalized averaging principle. Given this,\nmodeling, stability analysis, as well as the solution of PSS conditions can be\nunified in one process. The algorithmic implementation of the method in MATLAB\nis elaborated.

First, we quantify the overall engagement with images, finding\nthat one in 29 pageviews results in a click on at least one image, one order of\nmagnitude higher than interactions with other types of article content. Second,\nwe study what factors associate with image engagement and observe that clicks\non images occur more often in shorter articles and articles about visual arts\nor transports and biographies of less well-known people. Third, we look at\ninteractions with Wikipedia article previews and find that images help support\nreader information need when navigating through the site, especially for more\npopular pages.

    "abstract": "Decision trees are often preferred when implementing Machine Learning in\nembedded systems for their simplicity and scalability. Hoeffding Trees are a\ntype of Decision Trees that take advantage of the Hoeffding Bound to allow them\nto learn patterns in data without having to continuously store the data samples\nfor future reprocessing. This makes them especially suitable for deployment on\nembedded devices. In this work we highlight the features of an HLS\nimplementation of the Hoeffding Tree. The implementation parameters include the\nfeature size of the samples (D), the number of output classes (K), and the\nmaximum number of nodes to which the tree is allowed to grow (Nd). We target a\nXilinx MPSoC ZCU102, and evaluate: the design's resource requirements and clock\nfrequency for different numbers of classes and feature size, the execution time\non several synthetic datasets of varying sample sizes (N), number of output\nclasses and the execution time and accuracy for two datasets from UCI. For a\nproblem size of D3, K5, and N40000, a single decision tree operating at 103MHz\nis capable of 8.3x faster inference than the 1.2GHz ARM Cortex-A53 core.\nCompared to a reference implementation of the Hoeffding tree, we achieve\ncomparable classification accuracy for the UCI datasets.",

In this study, to overcome this difficulty, the automatic\nberthing system based on one of the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms,\nproximal policy optimization (PPO), is proposed because the RL algorithms can\nlearn an optimal control policy through trial-and-error by interacting with a\ngiven environment and does not require any pre-obtained training data, where\nthe control policy in the proposed PPO-based automatic berthing system controls\nrevolutions per second (RPS) and rudder angle of a ship.

To ensure the bottleneck structure of autoencoders when learning\nsequential data, we use a temporal VAE (TempVAE) that avoids an auto-regressive\nstructure for the observation variables. However, the low signal- to-noise\nratio of financial data in combination with the auto-pruning property of a VAE\ntypically makes the use of a VAE prone to posterior collapse.

Specifically, models of these\nprocesses can be discovered from event logs, i.e., sequences of events.\nHowever, the recorded events are often too fine-granular and result in\nunstructured models that are not meaningful for analysis. Log abstraction\ntherefore aims to group together events to obtain a higher-level representation\nof the event sequences. While such a transformation shall be driven by the\nanalysis goal, existing techniques force users to define how the abstraction is\ndone, rather than what the result shall be. In this paper, we propose GECCO, an\napproach for log abstraction that enables users to impose requirements on the\nresulting log in terms of constraints. GECCO then groups events so that the\nconstraints are satisfied and the distance to the original log is minimized.\nSince exhaustive log abstraction suffers from an exponential runtime\ncomplexity, GECCO also offers a heuristic approach guided by behavioral\ndependencies found in the log. We show that the abstraction quality of GECCO is\nsuperior to baseline solutions and demonstrate the relevance of considering\nconstraints during log abstraction in real-life settings.",

The idea of edge computing also makes intelligent services sink\nlocally. But in actual scenarios like dynamic edge computing networks (DECN),\ndue to fluctuations in available computing resources of intermediate servers\nand changes in bandwidth during data transmission, service reliability becomes\ndifficult to guarantee. Coupled with changes in the amount of data in a\nservice, the above three problems all make the existing reliability evaluation\nmethods no longer accurate. To study the effect of distributed service\ndeployment strategies under such a background, this paper proposes a\nreliability evaluation method (REMR) based on lower boundary rule under time\nconstraint to study the degree of the rationality of a service deployment plan\ncombined with DECN. In this scenario, time delay is the main concern which\nwould be affected by three quantitative factors: data packet storing and\nsending time, data transmission time and the calculation time of executing\nsub-tasks on the node devices, specially while the last two are in dynamic\nscenarios. In actual calculation, based on the idea of the minimal paths, the\nsolution set would to be found that can meet requirements in the current\ndeployment.

    "title": "A Structured Dictionary Perspective on Implicit Neural Representations",
    "abstract": "Propelled by new designs that permit to circumvent the spectral bias,\nimplicit neural representations (INRs) have recently emerged as a promising\nalternative to classical discretized representations of signals. Nevertheless,\ndespite their practical success, we still lack a proper theoretical\ncharacterization of how INRs represent signals. In this work, we aim to fill\nthis gap, and we propose a novel unified perspective to theoretically analyse\nINRs. Leveraging results from harmonic analysis and deep learning theory, we\nshow that most INR families are analogous to structured signal dictionaries\nwhose atoms are integer harmonics of the set of initial mapping frequencies.\nThis structure allows INRs to express signals with an exponentially increasing\nfrequency support using a number of parameters that only grows linearly with\ndepth. Afterwards, we explore the inductive bias of INRs exploiting recent\nresults about the empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK). Specifically, we show\nthat the eigenfunctions of the NTK can be seen as dictionary atoms whose inner\nproduct with the target signal determines the final performance of their\nreconstruction. In this regard, we reveal that meta-learning the initialization\nhas a reshaping effect of the NTK analogous to dictionary learning, building\ndictionary atoms as a combination of the examples seen during meta-training.\nOur results permit to design and tune novel INR architectures, but can also be\nof interest for the wider deep learning theory community.",

    "abstract": "The recent prosperity of learning-based image rain and noise removal is\nmainly due to the well-designed neural network architectures and large labeled\ndatasets. However, we find that current image rain and noise removal methods\nresult in low utilization of images. To alleviate the reliance on large labeled\ndatasets, we propose the task-driven image rain and noise removal (TRNR) based\non the introduced patch analysis strategy. The patch analysis strategy provides\nimage patches with various spatial and statistical properties for training and\nhas been verified to increase the utilization of images. Further, the patch\nanalysis strategy motivates us to consider learning image rain and noise\nremoval task-driven instead of data-driven. Therefore we introduce the\nN-frequency-K-shot learning task for TRNR. Each N-frequency-K-shot learning\ntask is based on a tiny dataset containing NK image patches sampled by the\npatch analysis strategy. TRNR enables neural networks to learn from abundant\nN-frequency-K-shot learning tasks other than from adequate data. To verify the\neffectiveness of TRNR, we build a light Multi-Scale Residual Network (MSResNet)\nwith about 0.9M parameters to learn image rain removal and use a simple ResNet\nwith about 1.2M parameters dubbed DNNet for blind gaussian noise removal with a\nfew images (for example, 20.0% train-set of Rain100H). Experimental results\ndemonstrate that TRNR enables MSResNet to learn better from fewer images. In\naddition, MSResNet and DNNet utilizing TRNR have obtained better performance\nthan most recent deep learning methods trained data-driven on large labeled\ndatasets. These experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness and\nsuperiority of the proposed TRNR. The codes of TRNR will be public soon.",

Without the thorough\nobject perception (i.e., bounding boxes, categories, and masks) of the image as\nprior knowledge, the style transformation of each object will be difficult to\ntrack in the image translation process. We propose panoptic-based object\nstyle-align generative adversarial networks (POSA-GANs) for image-to-image\ntranslation together with a compact panoptic segmentation dataset. The panoptic\nsegmentation model is utilized to extract panoptic-level perception (i.e.,\noverlap-removed foreground object instances and background semantic regions in\nthe image). This is utilized to guide the alignment between the object content\ncodes of the input domain image and object style codes sampled from the style\nspace of the target domain.

Specifically, MCCNet is based on the general\nencoder-decoder architecture, and contains a novel key component named\nMulti-Content Complementation Module (MCCM), which bridges the encoder and the\ndecoder. In MCCM, we consider multiple types of features that are critical to\nRSI-SOD, including foreground features, edge features, background features, and\nglobal image-level features, and exploit the content complementarity between\nthem to highlight salient regions over various scales in RSI features through\nthe attention mechanism. Besides, we comprehensively introduce pixel-level,\nmap-level and metric-aware losses in the training phase.

As the target is to embed\nlatent features in the discrete embedding space, developing quantization for\nuser-item representations with a few low-precision integers confronts the\nchallenge of high information loss, thus leading to unsatisfactory performance\nin Top-K recommendation.\nIn this work, we study the problem of representation learning for\nrecommendation with 1-bit quantization. We propose a model named Low-loss\nQuantized Graph Convolutional Network (L^2Q-GCN). Different from previous work\nthat plugs quantization as the final encoder of user-item embeddings, L^2Q-GCN\nlearns the quantized representations whilst capturing the structural\ninformation of user-item interaction graphs at different semantic levels. This\nachieves the substantial retention of intermediate interactive information,\nalleviating the feature smoothing issue for ranking caused by numerical\nquantization. To further improve the model performance, we also present an\nadvanced solution named L^2Q-GCN-anl with quantization approximation and\nannealing training strategy. We conduct extensive experiments on four\nbenchmarks over Top-K recommendation task.

    "abstract": "By leveraging data from a fully labeled source domain, unsupervised domain\nadaptation (UDA) improves classification performance on an unlabeled target\ndomain through explicit discrepancy minimization of data distribution or\nadversarial learning. As an enhancement, category alignment is involved during\nadaptation to reinforce target feature discrimination by utilizing model\nprediction. However, there remain unexplored problems about pseudo-label\ninaccuracy incurred by wrong category predictions on target domain, and\ndistribution deviation caused by overfitting on source domain. In this paper,\nwe propose a model-agnostic two-stage learning framework, which greatly reduces\nflawed model predictions using soft pseudo-label strategy and avoids\noverfitting on source domain with a curriculum learning strategy.\nTheoretically, it successfully decreases the combined risk in the upper bound\nof expected error on the target domain. At the first stage, we train a model\nwith distribution alignment-based UDA method to obtain soft semantic label on\ntarget domain with rather high confidence. To avoid overfitting on source\ndomain, at the second stage, we propose a curriculum learning strategy to\nadaptively control the weighting between losses from the two domains so that\nthe focus of the training stage is gradually shifted from source distribution\nto target distribution with prediction confidence boosted on the target domain.\nExtensive experiments on two well-known benchmark datasets validate the\nuniversal effectiveness of our proposed framework on promoting the performance\nof the top-ranked UDA algorithms and demonstrate its consistent superior\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "We live in the information age. Claude Shannon, as the father of the\ninformation age, gave us a theory of communications that quantified an \"amount\nof information,\" but, as he pointed out, \"no concept of information itself was\ndefined.\" Logical entropy provides that definition. Logical entropy is the\nnatural measure of the notion of information based on distinctions,\ndifferences, distinguishability, and diversity. It is the (normalized)\nquantitative measure of the distinctions of a partition on a set--just as the\nBoole-Laplace logical probability is the normalized quantitative measure of the\nelements of a subset of a set. And partitions and subsets are mathematically\ndual concepts--so the logic of partitions is dual in that sense to the usual\nBoolean logic of subsets, and hence the name \"logical entropy.\" The logical\nentropy of a partition has a simple interpretation as the probability that a\ndistinction or dit (elements in different blocks) is obtained in two\nindependent draws from the underlying set. The Shannon entropy is shown to also\nbe based on this notion of information-as-distinctions; it is the average\nminimum number of binary partitions (bits) that need to be joined to make all\nthe same distinctions of the given partition. Hence all the concepts of simple,\njoint, conditional, and mutual logical entropy can be transformed into the\ncorresponding concepts of Shannon entropy by a uniform non-linear dit-bit\ntransform. And finally logical entropy linearizes naturally to the\ncorresponding quantum concept. The quantum logical entropy of an observable\napplied to a state is the probability that two different eigenvalues are\nobtained in two independent projective measurements of that observable on that\nstate.\nKeywords: logical entropy, Shannon entropy, partitions, MaxEntropy, quantum\nlogical entropy, von Neumann entropy",

    "abstract": "Wireless radio channels are known to contain information about the\nsurrounding propagation environment, which can be extracted using established\nwireless sensing methods. Thus, today's ubiquitous wireless devices are\nattractive targets for passive eavesdroppers to launch reconnaissance attacks.\nIn particular, by overhearing standard communication signals, eavesdroppers\nobtain estimations of wireless channels which can give away sensitive\ninformation about indoor environments. For instance, by applying simple\nstatistical methods, adversaries can infer human motion from wireless channel\nobservations, allowing to remotely monitor premises of victims. In this work,\nbuilding on the advent of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), we propose\nIRShield as a novel countermeasure against adversarial wireless sensing.\nIRShield is designed as a plug-and-play privacy-preserving extension to\nexisting wireless networks. At the core of IRShield, we design an IRS\nconfiguration algorithm to obfuscate wireless channels. We validate the\neffectiveness with extensive experimental evaluations.

The quality of the reconstructed\nimages using phase-only CGHs is degraded because the amplitude of the\nreconstructed image is difficult to control. Iterative optimization methods\nsuch as the Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm are one option for improving image\nquality. They optimize CGHs in an iterative fashion to obtain a higher image\nquality. However, such iterative computation is time consuming, and the\nimprovement in image quality is often stagnant. Recently, deep learning-based\nhologram computation has been proposed. Deep neural networks directly infer\nCGHs from input image data. However, it is limited to reconstructing images\nthat are the same size as the hologram. In this study, we use deep learning to\noptimize phase-only CGHs generated using scaled diffraction computations and\nthe random phase-free method. By combining the random phase-free method with\nthe scaled diffraction computation, it is possible to handle a zoomable\nreconstructed image larger than the hologram.

However, due\nto the great variety of potential NVs, including NPs materials and their\nfunctionalization, in addition to the plethora of molecules that could\ntransport, this fields presents a great challenge in terms of resources to find\nNVs with the most optimal physicochemical properties such as particle size and\ndrug loading, where most of efforts rely on trial and error experimentation. In\nthis regard, Artificial intelligence (AI) and metaheuristic algorithms offer\nefficient of the state-of-the-art modelling and optimization, respectively.\nThis review focuses, through a systematic search, on the use of artificial\nintelligence and metaheuristic algorithms for nanoparticle synthesis in drug\ndelivery systems. The main findings are: neural networks are better at\nmodelling NVs properties than linear regression algorithms and response surface\nmethodology, there is a very limited number of studies comparing AI or\nmetaheuristic algorithm, and there is no information regarding the\nappropriateness of calculations of the sample size. Based on these findings,\nmultilayer perceptron artificial neural network and adaptive neuro fuzzy\ninference system were tested for their modelling performance with a NV dataset;\nfinding the latter the better algorithm. For metaheuristic algorithms,\nbenchmark functions were optimized with cuckoo search, firefly algorithm,\ngenetic algorithm and symbiotic organism search; finding cuckoo search and\nsymbiotic organism search with the best performance. Finally, methods to\nestimate appropriate sample size for AI algorithms are discussed.",

    "title": "User-click Modelling for Predicting Purchase Intent",
    "abstract": "This thesis contributes a structured inquiry into the open actuarial\nmathematics problem of modelling user behaviour using machine learning methods,\nin order to predict purchase intent of non-life insurance products. It is\nvaluable for a company to understand user interactions with their website as it\nprovides rich and individualized insight into consumer behaviour. Most of\nexisting research in user behaviour modelling aims to explain or predict clicks\non a search engine result page or to estimate click-through rate in sponsored\nsearch. These models are based on concepts about users' examination patterns of\na web page and the web page's representation of items. Investigating the\nproblem of modelling user behaviour to predict purchase intent on a business\nwebsite, we observe that a user's intention yields high dependency on how the\nuser navigates the website in terms of how many different web pages the user\nvisited, what kind of web pages the user interacted with, and how much time the\nuser spent on each web page. Inspired by these findings, we propose two\ndifferent ways of representing features of a user session leading to two models\nfor user click-based purchase prediction: one based on a Feed Forward Neural\nNetwork, and another based on a Recurrent Neural Network. We examine the\ndiscriminativeness of user-clicks for predicting purchase intent by comparing\nthe above two models with a model using demographic features of the user. Our\nexperimental results show that our click-based models significantly outperform\nthe demographic model, in terms of standard classification evaluation metrics,\nand that a model based on a sequential representation of user clicks yields\nslightly greater performance than a model based on feature engineering of\nclicks.",

    "abstract": "Broadcast/multicast communication systems are typically designed to optimize\nthe outage rate criterion, which neglects the performance of the fraction of\nclients with the worst channel conditions. Targeting ultra-reliable\ncommunication scenarios, this paper takes a complementary approach by\nintroducing the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) rate as the expected rate of a\nworst-case fraction of clients. To support differential quality-of-service\n(QoS) levels in this class of clients, layered division multiplexing (LDM) is\napplied, which enables decoding at different rates. Focusing on a practical\nscenario in which the transmitter does not know the fading distribution, layer\nallocation is optimized based on a dataset sampled during deployment. The\noptimality gap caused by the availability of limited data is bounded via a\ngeneralization analysis, and the sample complexity is shown to increase as the\ndesignated fraction of worst-case clients decreases. Considering this\ntheoretical result, meta-learning is introduced as a means to reduce sample\ncomplexity by leveraging data from previous deployments. Numerical experiments\ndemonstrate that LDM improves spectral efficiency even for small datasets;\nthat, for sufficiently large datasets, the proposed mirror-descent-based layer\noptimization scheme achieves a CVaR rate close to that achieved when the\ntransmitter knows the fading distribution; and that meta-learning can\nsignificantly reduce data requirements.",

    "title": "Practitioner-Centric Approach for Early Incident Detection Using  Crowdsourced Data for Emergency Services",
    "abstract": "Emergency response is highly dependent on the time of incident reporting.\nUnfortunately, the traditional approach to receiving incident reports (e.g.,\ncalling 911 in the USA) has time delays. Crowdsourcing platforms such as Waze\nprovide an opportunity for early identification of incidents. However,\ndetecting incidents from crowdsourced data streams is difficult due to the\nchallenges of noise and uncertainty associated with such data. Further, simply\noptimizing over detection accuracy can compromise spatial-temporal localization\nof the inference, thereby making such approaches infeasible for real-world\ndeployment. This paper presents a novel problem formulation and solution\napproach for practitioner-centered incident detection using crowdsourced data\nby using emergency response management as a case-study. The proposed approach\nCROME (Crowdsourced Multi-objective Event Detection) quantifies the\nrelationship between the performance metrics of incident classification (e.g.,\nF1 score) and the requirements of model practitioners (e.g., 1 km. radius for\nincident detection). First, we show how crowdsourced reports, ground-truth\nhistorical data, and other relevant determinants such as traffic and weather\ncan be used together in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for\nearly detection of emergency incidents. Then, we use a Pareto\noptimization-based approach to optimize the output of the CNN in tandem with\npractitioner-centric parameters to balance detection accuracy and\nspatial-temporal localization. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of\nthis approach using crowdsourced data from Waze and traffic accident reports\nfrom Nashville, TN, USA. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach\noutperforms existing approaches in incident detection while simultaneously\noptimizing the needs for real-world deployment and usability.",

    "abstract": "Longitudinal interaction studies with Socially Assistive Robots are crucial\nto ensure that the robot is relevant for long-term use and its perceptions are\nnot prone to the novelty effect. In this paper, we present a dynamic Bayesian\nnetwork (DBN) to capture the longitudinal interactions participants had with a\nteleoperated robot coach (RC) delivering mindfulness sessions. The DBN model is\nused to study complex, temporal interactions between the participants\nself-reported personality traits, weekly baseline wellbeing scores, session\nratings, and facial AUs elicited during the sessions in a 5-week longitudinal\nstudy. DBN modelling involves learning a graphical representation that\nfacilitates intuitive understanding of how multiple components contribute to\nthe longitudinal changes in session ratings corresponding to the perceptions of\nthe RC, and participants relaxation and calm levels. The learnt model captures\nthe following within and between sessions aspects of the longitudinal\ninteraction study: influence of the 5 personality dimensions on the facial AU\nstates and the session ratings, influence of facial AU states on the session\nratings, and the influences within the items of the session ratings. The DBN\nstructure is learnt using first 3 time points and the obtained model is used to\npredict the session ratings of the last 2 time points of the 5-week\nlongitudinal data. The predictions are quantified using subject-wise RMSE and\nR2 scores. We also demonstrate two applications of the model, namely,\nimputation of missing values in the dataset and estimation of longitudinal\nsession ratings of a new participant with a given personality profile. The\nobtained DBN model thus facilitates learning of conditional dependency\nstructure between variables in the longitudinal data and offers inferences and\nconceptual understanding which are not possible through other regression\nmethodologies.",

    "abstract": "Efficient optimization of topology and raster angle has shown unprecedented\nenhancements in the mechanical properties of 3D printed thermoplastic polymers.\nTopology optimization helps reduce the waste of raw material in the fabrication\nof 3D printed parts, thus decreasing production costs associated with\nmanufacturing lighter structures. Fiber orientation plays an important role in\nincreasing the stiffness of a structure. This paper develops and tests a new\nmethod for handling stress constraints in topology and fiber orientation\noptimization of 3D printed orthotropic structures. The stress constraints are\ncoupled with an objective function that maximizes stiffness. This is\naccomplished by using the modified solid isotropic material with penalization\nmethod with the method of moving asymptotes as the optimizer. Each element has\na fictitious density and an angle as the main design variables. To reduce the\nnumber of stress constraints and thus the computational cost, a new clustering\nstrategy is employed in which the highest stresses in the principal material\ncoordinates are grouped separately into two clusters using an adjusted\n$P$-norm. A detailed description of the formulation and sensitivity analysis is\ndiscussed. While we present an analysis of 2D structures in the numerical\nexamples section, the method can also be used for 3D structures, as the\nformulation is generic. Our results show that this method can produce efficient\nstructures suitable for 3D printing while avoiding stress concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Education has been said to have the potential\nfor building more personalised curricula, as well as democratising education\nworldwide and creating a Renaissance of new ways of teaching and learning.\nMillions of students are already starting to benefit from the use of these\ntechnologies, but millions more around the world are not. If this trend\ncontinues, the first delivery of AI in Education could be greater educational\ninequality, along with a global misallocation of educational resources\nmotivated by the current technological determinism narrative. In this paper, we\nfocus on speculating and posing questions around the future of AI in Education,\nwith the aim of starting the pressing conversation that would set the right\nfoundations for the new generation of education that is permeated by\ntechnology. This paper starts by synthesising how AI might change how we learn\nand teach, focusing specifically on the case of personalised learning\ncompanions, and then move to discuss some socio-technical features that will be\ncrucial for avoiding the perils of these AI systems worldwide (and perhaps\nensuring their success). This paper also discusses the potential of using AI\ntogether with free, participatory and democratic resources, such as Wikipedia,\nOpen Educational Resources and open-source tools. We also emphasise the need\nfor collectively designing human-centered, transparent, interactive and\ncollaborative AI-based algorithms that empower and give complete agency to\nstakeholders, as well as support new emerging pedagogies. Finally, we ask what\nwould it take for this educational revolution to provide egalitarian and\nempowering access to education, beyond any political, cultural, language,\ngeographical and learning ability barriers.",

The results show that as compared to the egoistic AV, the altruistic AV\nsignificantly avoids disrupting the following human driver's initial plan and\nleads the following human driver to achieve considerably smaller car-following\ngap distance and time headway. Moreover, we investigated the impacts of the\nsocially compatible control design with different altruism levels of the AV\nusing statistical assessments.

However, the high optical loss of many optical components\ncoupled with the low efficiency of laser sources result in high aggregate power\nrequirements for the thousands of optical transceivers used by these networks.\nAs optical interconnects stay always on even as traffic demands ebb and flow,\nmost of this power is wasted. We present LC/DC, a data center network system\narchitecture in which the operating system, the switch, and the optical\ncomponents are co-designed to achieve energy proportionality.\nLC/DC capitalizes on the path divergence of data center networks to turn on\nand off redundant paths according to traffic demand, while maintaining full\nconnectivity. Turning off redundant paths allows the optical transceivers and\ntheir electronic drivers to power down and save energy. Maintaining full\nconnectivity hides the laser turn-on delay. At the node layer, intercepting\nsend requests within the OS allows for the NIC's laser turn-on delay to be\nfully overlapped with TCP/IP packet processing, and thus egress links can\nremain powered off until needed with zero performance penalty.\nWe demonstrate the feasibility of LC/DC by i) implementing the necessary\nmodifications in the Linux kernel and device drivers, ii) implementing a\n10Gbit/s FPGA switch, and iii) performing physical experiments with optical\ndevices and circuit simulations. Our results on university data center traces\nand models of Facebook and Microsoft data center traffic show that LC/DC saves\non average 60% of the optical transceivers power (68% max) at the cost of 6%\nhigher packet delay.",

To achieve this, we start by synthesizing usable data\nthrough recovering the knowledge from a pre-trained deep neural network. Then\nwe use the synthesized data and their predicted soft-labels to guide neural\narchitecture search. We identify that the NAS task requires the synthesized\ndata (we target at image domain here) with enough semantics, diversity, and a\nminimal domain gap from the natural images. For semantics, we propose recursive\nlabel calibration to produce more informative outputs. For diversity, we\npropose a regional update strategy to generate more diverse and\nsemantically-enriched synthetic data. For minimal domain gap, we use input and\nfeature-level regularization to mimic the original data distribution in latent\nspace. We instantiate our proposed framework with three popular NAS algorithms:\nDARTS, ProxylessNAS and SPOS. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that the\narchitectures discovered by searching with our synthetic data achieve accuracy\nthat is comparable to, or even higher than, architectures discovered by\nsearching from the original ones, for the first time, deriving the conclusion\nthat NAS can be done effectively with no need of access to the original or\ncalled natural data if the synthesis method is well designed.

Legged systems are capable of\ntraversing more complex terrain than wheeled robots, but to fully exploit this\ncapability, we need the high-level path planner in the navigation system to be\naware of the walking capabilities of the low-level locomotion policy on varying\nterrains. We achieve this by using proprioceptive feedback to estimate the safe\noperating limits of the walking policy, and to sense unexpected obstacles and\nterrain properties like smoothness or softness of the ground that may be missed\nby vision. The navigation system uses onboard cameras to generate an occupancy\nmap and a corresponding cost map to reach the goal. The FMM (Fast Marching\nMethod) planner then generates a target path. The velocity command generator\ntakes this as input to generate the desired velocity for the locomotion policy\nusing as input additional constraints, from the safety advisor, of unexpected\nobstacles and terrain determined speed limits. We show superior performance\ncompared to wheeled robot (LoCoBot) baselines, and other baselines which have\ndisjoint high-level planning and low-level control.

Currently, the process of collecting high-magnification\ncryo-EM micrographs, data collection, requires human input and manual tuning of\nparameters, as expert operators must navigate low- and medium-magnification\nimages to find good high-magnification collection locations. Automating this is\nnon-trivial: the images suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio and are affected\nby a range of experimental parameters that can differ for each collection\nsession.

Under some regularity conditions, the observed response can be\nformulated as the response of a mean regression problem with both the\nconfounding variables and the treatment indicator as the independent variables.\nUsing such formulation, we investigate two methods for ATE estimation and\ninference based on the estimated mean regression function via DNN regression\nusing a specific network architecture. We show that both DNN estimates of ATE\nare consistent with dimension-free consistency rates under some assumptions on\nthe underlying true mean regression model. Our model assumptions accommodate\nthe potentially complicated dependence structure of the observed response on\nthe covariates, including latent factors and nonlinear interactions between the\ntreatment indicator and confounding variables. We also establish the asymptotic\nnormality of our estimators based on the idea of sample splitting, ensuring\nprecise inference and uncertainty quantification.

This\ntechnique has been used in numerous fields including materials science, shock\nphysics, inertial confinement fusion, and other national security applications.\nIn many of these applications, however, complications resulting from noise,\nscatter, complex beam dynamics, etc. prevent the reconstruction of density from\nbeing accurate enough to identify the underlying physics with sufficient\nconfidence. As such, density reconstruction from static/dynamic radiography has\ntypically been limited to identifying discontinuous features such as cracks and\nvoids in a number of these applications.\nIn this work, we propose a fundamentally new approach to reconstructing\ndensity from a temporal sequence of radiographic images. Using only the robust\nfeatures identifiable in radiographs, we combine them with the underlying\nhydrodynamic equations of motion using a machine learning approach, namely,\nconditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN), to determine the density\nfields from a dynamic sequence of radiographs. Next, we seek to further enhance\nthe hydrodynamic consistency of the ML-based density reconstruction through a\nprocess of parameter estimation and projection onto a hydrodynamic manifold. In\nthis context, we note that the distance from the hydrodynamic manifold given by\nthe training data to the test data in the parameter space considered both\nserves as a diagnostic of the robustness of the predictions and serves to\naugment the training database, with the expectation that the latter will\nfurther reduce future density reconstruction errors.

To deepen our understanding of sequential\ntraining, this study provides a theoretical analysis of generalization\nperformance in a solvable case of continual learning. We consider neural\nnetworks in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime that continually learn\ntarget functions from task to task, and investigate the generalization by using\nan established statistical mechanical analysis of kernel ridge-less regression.\nWe first show characteristic transitions from positive to negative transfer.\nMore similar targets above a specific critical value can achieve positive\nknowledge transfer for the subsequent task while catastrophic forgetting occurs\neven with very similar targets. Next, we investigate a variant of continual\nlearning where the model learns the same target function in multiple tasks.\nEven for the same target, the trained model shows some transfer and forgetting\ndepending on the sample size of each task. We can guarantee that the\ngeneralization error monotonically decreases from task to task for equal sample\nsizes while unbalanced sample sizes deteriorate the generalization.

    "abstract": "Demonstrating quantum advantage requires experimental implementation of a\ncomputational task that is hard to achieve using state-of-the-art classical\nsystems. One approach is to perform sampling from a probability distribution\nassociated with a class of highly entangled many-body wavefunctions. It has\nbeen suggested that this approach can be certified with the Linear\nCross-Entropy Benchmark (XEB). We critically examine this notion. First, in a\n\"benign\" setting where an honest implementation of noisy quantum circuits is\nassumed, we characterize the conditions under which the XEB approximates the\nfidelity. Second, in an \"adversarial\" setting where all possible classical\nalgorithms are considered for comparison, we show that achieving relatively\nhigh XEB values does not imply faithful simulation of quantum dynamics. We\npresent an efficient classical algorithm that, with 1 GPU within 2s, yields\nhigh XEB values, namely 2-12% of those obtained in experiments. By identifying\nand exploiting several vulnerabilities of the XEB, we achieve high XEB values\nwithout full simulation of quantum circuits. Remarkably, our algorithm features\nbetter scaling with the system size than noisy quantum devices for commonly\nstudied random circuit ensembles. To quantitatively explain the success of our\nalgorithm and the limitations of the XEB, we use a theoretical framework in\nwhich the average XEB and fidelity are mapped to statistical models. We\nillustrate the relation between the XEB and the fidelity for quantum circuits\nin various architectures, with different gate choices, and in the presence of\nnoise. Our results show that XEB's utility as a proxy for fidelity hinges on\nseveral conditions, which must be checked in the benign setting but cannot be\nassumed in the adversarial setting. Thus, the XEB alone has limited utility as\na benchmark for quantum advantage. We discuss ways to overcome these\nlimitations.",

    "abstract": "We present a fully automated method of integrating intraoral scan (IOS) and\ndental cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT) images into one image by\ncomplementing each image's weaknesses. Dental CBCT alone may not be able to\ndelineate precise details of the tooth surface due to limited image resolution\nand various CBCT artifacts, including metal-induced artifacts. IOS is very\naccurate for the scanning of narrow areas, but it produces cumulative stitching\nerrors during full-arch scanning. The proposed method is intended not only to\ncompensate the low-quality of CBCT-derived tooth surfaces with IOS, but also to\ncorrect the cumulative stitching errors of IOS across the entire dental arch.\nMoreover, the integration provide both gingival structure of IOS and tooth\nroots of CBCT in one image. The proposed fully automated method consists of\nfour parts; (i) individual tooth segmentation and identification module for IOS\ndata (TSIM-IOS); (ii) individual tooth segmentation and identification module\nfor CBCT data (TSIM-CBCT); (iii) global-to-local tooth registration between IOS\nand CBCT; and (iv) stitching error correction of full-arch IOS. The\nexperimental results show that the proposed method achieved landmark and\nsurface distance errors of 0.11mm and 0.30mm, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the patterns of human mobility between cities has various\napplications from transport engineering to spatial modeling of the spreading of\ncontagious diseases. We adopt a city-centric, data-driven perspective to\nquantify such patterns and introduce the mobility signature as a tool for\nunderstanding how a city (or a region) is embedded in the wider mobility\nnetwork. We demonstrate the potential of the mobility signature approach\nthrough two applications that build on mobile-phone-based data from Finland.\nFirst, we use mobility signatures to show that the well-known radiation model\nis more accurate for mobility flows associated with larger cities, while the\ntraditional gravity model appears a better fit for less populated areas.\nSecond, we illustrate how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic disrupted the mobility\npatterns in Finland in the spring of 2020. These two cases demonstrate the\nability of the mobility signatures to quickly capture features of mobility\nflows that are harder to extract using more traditional methods.",

This work uses convolutional neural networks for\ncase-level classification trained with elastic deformation of the vessel tree\nsegmentation masks to artificially augment training data. Using only masks as\nthe input to our model uniquely allows us to apply such deformations much more\naggressively than one could with conventional image volumes while retaining\nsample realism.\nThe neural network classifies the presence of an LVO and the affected\nhemisphere. In a 5-fold cross validated ablation study, we demonstrate that the\nuse of the suggested augmentation enables us to train robust models even from\nfew data sets. Training the EfficientNetB1 architecture on 100 data sets, the\nproposed augmentation scheme was able to raise the ROC AUC to 0.85 from a\nbaseline value of 0.57 using no augmentation. The best performance was achieved\nusing a 3D-DenseNet yielding an AUC of 0.88.

However, in many\napplications this minimization problem cannot be solved exactly, and instead, a\nnumerical method that computes an approximate minimum over a suitable subfamily\nof Borel functions has to be used. The quality of the result depends on the\nadequacy of the subfamily and the performance of the numerical method. In this\npaper, we derive an expected value representation of the minimal mean square\ndistance which in many applications can efficiently be approximated with a\nstandard Monte Carlo average. This enables us to provide guarantees for the\naccuracy of any numerical approximation of a given conditional expectation.

Alexandroff spaces yield a\ndirectional topological space: the topology is defined by a unique minimal\nbasis defined by an open set for each variable x, specified as the intersection\nof all open sets containing x. Alexandroff spaces induce a (reflexive,\ntransitive) preorder. Alexandroff spaces satisfying the Kolmogorov T0\nseparation criterion, where open sets distinguish variables, converts the\npreordering into a partial ordering. Our approach broadly is to construct a\ntopological representation of posets from data, and then use the poset\nrepresentation to build a conventional DAG causal model. We illustrate our\nframework by showing how it unifies disparate algorithms and case studies\nproposed previously. Topology plays two key roles in causal discovery. First,\ntopological separability constraints on datasets have been used in several\nprevious approaches to infer causal structure from observations and\ninterventions. Second, a diverse range ofgraphical models used to represent\ncausal structures can be represented in a unified way in terms of a topological\nrepresentation of the induced poset structure.

Modern imaging techniques such as chemical\nexchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI drive the hope to improve early\ndetection even further through the imaging of metabolites in the body. To image\nsmall structures in the joints of patients, typically one of the first regions\nwhere changes due to the disease occur, a high resolution for the CEST MR\nimaging is necessary. Currently, however, CEST MR suffers from an inherently\nlow resolution due to the underlying physical constraints of the acquisition.\nIn this work we compared established up-sampling techniques to neural\nnetwork-based super-resolution approaches.

Then, we proposed a convolutional neural network (CNN) based\ndeep-learning framework that can inversely determine the accurate cohesive\nparameters from DL-ISI fringe images. Plate-impact experiments on a polyurea\nsample with a mid-plane crack have been performed, and the generated DL-ISI\nfringe image has been inpainted by a Conditional Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (cGAN). For the first time, the dynamic cohesive parameters of\npolyurea have been successfully obtained by the pre-trained CNN architecture\nwith the computational dataset, which is consistent with the correlation method\nand the linear fracture mechanics estimation. Apparent dynamic toughening is\nfound in polyurea, where the cohesive strength is found to be nearly three\ntimes higher than the spall strength under the symmetric impact with the same\nimpact speed. These experimental results fill the gap in the current\nunderstanding of copolymer's cooperative-failure strength under extreme local\nloading conditions near the crack tip.

Here we compare the representations learned by\neight different convolutional neural networks, each with identical ResNet\narchitectures and trained on the same family of egocentric images, but embedded\nwithin different learning systems. Specifically, the representations are\ntrained to guide action in a compound reinforcement learning task; to predict\none or a combination of three task-related targets with supervision; or using\none of three different unsupervised objectives. Using representational\nsimilarity analysis, we find that the network trained with reinforcement\nlearning differs most from the other networks.

Further analysis suggests these representations may arise in\norder to guide long-term behavior and goal-seeking in the RL agent. Our results\nprovide insights into how the properties of neural representations are\ninfluenced by objective functions and can inform transfer learning approaches.",

    "title": "Efficient Universal Quantum Compilation: An Inverse-free Solovay-Kitaev  Algorithm",
    "abstract": "The Solovay-Kitaev algorithm is a fundamental result in quantum computation.\nIt gives an algorithm for efficiently compiling arbitrary unitaries using\nuniversal gate sets: any unitary can be approximated by short gates sequences,\nwhose length scales merely poly-logarithmically with accuracy. As a\nconsequence, the choice of gate set is typically unimportant in quantum\ncomputing. However, the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm requires the gate set to be\ninverse-closed. It has been a longstanding open question if efficient\nalgorithmic compilation is possible without this condition. In this work, we\nprovide the first inverse-free Solovay-Kitaev algorithm, which makes no\nassumption on the structure within a gate set beyond universality, answering\nthis problem in the affirmative, and providing an efficient compilation\nalgorithm in the absence of inverses for both $\\text{SU}(d)$ and $\\text{SL}(d,\n\\mathbb{C})$. The algorithm works by showing that approximate gate\nimplementations of the generalized Pauli group can self-correct their errors.",

    "title": "Graph Neural Networks for Charged Particle Tracking on FPGAs",
    "abstract": "The determination of charged particle trajectories in collisions at the CERN\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) is an important but challenging problem, especially\nin the high interaction density conditions expected during the future\nhigh-luminosity phase of the LHC (HL-LHC). Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a\ntype of geometric deep learning algorithm that has successfully been applied to\nthis task by embedding tracker data as a graph -- nodes represent hits, while\nedges represent possible track segments -- and classifying the edges as true or\nfake track segments. However, their study in hardware- or software-based\ntrigger applications has been limited due to their large computational cost. In\nthis paper, we introduce an automated translation workflow, integrated into a\nbroader tool called $\\texttt{hls4ml}$, for converting GNNs into firmware for\nfield-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). We use this translation tool to\nimplement GNNs for charged particle tracking, trained using the TrackML\nchallenge dataset, on FPGAs with designs targeting different graph sizes, task\ncomplexites, and latency/throughput requirements. This work could enable the\ninclusion of charged particle tracking GNNs at the trigger level for HL-LHC\nexperiments.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel method for identifying the mass composition of\nultra-high-energy cosmic rays using deep learning. The key idea of the method\nis to use a chain of two neural networks. The first network predicts the type\nof a primary particle for individual events, while the second infers the mass\ncomposition of an ensemble of events. We apply this method to the Monte-Carlo\ndata for the Telescope Array Surface Detectors readings, on which it yields an\nunprecedented low error of 7% for 4-component approximation. The statistical\nerror is shown to be inferior to the systematic one related to the choice of\nthe hadronic interaction model used for simulations.",

    "abstract": "We present a Newton-type method that converges fast from any initialization\nand for arbitrary convex objectives with Lipschitz Hessians. We achieve this by\nmerging the ideas of cubic regularization with a certain adaptive\nLevenberg--Marquardt penalty. In particular, we show that the iterates given by\n$x^{k+1}=x^k - \\bigl(\\nabla^2 f(x^k) + \\sqrt{H\\|\\nabla f(x^k)\\|}\n\\mathbf{I}\\bigr)^{-1}\\nabla f(x^k)$, where $H>0$ is a constant, converge\nglobally with a $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{k^2})$ rate. Our method is the first\nvariant of Newton's method that has both cheap iterations and provably fast\nglobal convergence. Moreover, we prove that locally our method converges\nsuperlinearly when the objective is strongly convex. To boost the method's\nperformance, we present a line search procedure that does not need\nhyperparameters and is provably efficient.",
