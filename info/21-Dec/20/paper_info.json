    "abstract": "Face image manipulation methods, despite having many beneficial applications\nin computer graphics, can also raise concerns by affecting an individual's\nprivacy or spreading disinformation. In this work, we propose a proactive\ndefense to prevent face manipulation from happening in the first place. To this\nend, we introduce a novel data-driven approach that produces image-specific\nperturbations which are embedded in the original images. The key idea is that\nthese protected images prevent face manipulation by causing the manipulation\nmodel to produce a predefined manipulation target (uniformly colored output\nimage in our case) instead of the actual manipulation. Compared to traditional\nadversarial attacks that optimize noise patterns for each image individually,\nour generalized model only needs a single forward pass, thus running orders of\nmagnitude faster and allowing for easy integration in image processing stacks,\neven on resource-constrained devices like smartphones. In addition, we propose\nto leverage a differentiable compression approximation, hence making generated\nperturbations robust to common image compression. We further show that a\ngenerated perturbation can simultaneously prevent against multiple manipulation\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "The lifelong learning paradigm in machine learning is an attractive\nalternative to the more prominent isolated learning scheme not only due to its\nresemblance to biological learning, but also its potential to reduce energy\nwaste by obviating excessive model re-training. A key challenge to this\nparadigm is the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting. With the increasing\npopularity and success of pre-trained models in machine learning, we pose the\nquestion: What role does pre-training play in lifelong learning, specifically\nwith respect to catastrophic forgetting? We investigate existing methods in the\ncontext of large, pre-trained models and evaluate their performance on a\nvariety of text and image classification tasks, including a large-scale study\nusing a novel dataset of 15 diverse NLP tasks. Across all settings, we observe\nthat generic pre-training implicitly alleviates the effects of catastrophic\nforgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially compared to randomly\ninitialized models. We then further investigate why pre-training alleviates\nforgetting in this setting. We study this phenomenon by analyzing the loss\nlandscape, finding that pre-trained weights appear to ease forgetting by\nleading to wider minima. Based on this insight, we propose jointly optimizing\nfor current task loss and loss basin sharpness in order to explicitly encourage\nwider basins during sequential fine-tuning. We show that this optimization\napproach leads to performance comparable to the state-of-the-art in\ntask-sequential continual learning across multiple settings, without retaining\na memory that scales in size with the number of tasks.",

However, many traditional simulation engines use a constraint-based\napproach instead of direct prediction. Here we present a framework for\nconstraint-based learned simulation, where a scalar constraint function is\nimplemented as a neural network, and future predictions are computed as the\nsolutions to optimization problems under these learned constraints. We\nimplement our method using a graph neural network as the constraint function\nand gradient descent as the constraint solver. The architecture can be trained\nby standard backpropagation. We test the model on a variety of challenging\nphysical domains, including simulated ropes, bouncing balls, colliding\nirregular shapes and splashing fluids. Our model achieves better or comparable\nperformance to top learned simulators. A key advantage of our model is the\nability to generalize to more solver iterations at test time to improve the\nsimulation accuracy. We also show how hand-designed constraints can be added at\ntest time to satisfy objectives which were not present in the training data,\nwhich is not possible with forward approaches.

To achieve this\ngoal, we introduce an oracle training paradigm, which forces the decomposition\nof the latent representation of LSTM and the Transformer and supervises with\nthe transitions of the Pushdown Automaton (PDA) of the corresponding CFL. With\nthe forced decomposition, we show that the performance upper bounds of LSTM and\nTransformer in learning CFL are close: both of them can simulate a stack and\nperform stack operation along with state transitions.

    "abstract": "We study the verification problem for closed-loop dynamical systems with\nneural-network controllers (NNCS). This problem is commonly reduced to\ncomputing the set of reachable states. When considering dynamical systems and\nneural networks in isolation, there exist precise approaches for that task\nbased on set representations respectively called Taylor models and zonotopes.\nHowever, the combination of these approaches to NNCS is non-trivial because,\nwhen converting between the set representations, dependency information gets\nlost in each control cycle and the accumulated approximation error quickly\nrenders the result useless. We present an algorithm to chain approaches based\non Taylor models and zonotopes, yielding a precise reachability algorithm for\nNNCS. Because the algorithm only acts at the interface of the isolated\napproaches, it is applicable to general dynamical systems and neural networks\nand can benefit from future advances in these areas. Our implementation\ndelivers state-of-the-art performance and is the first to successfully analyze\nall benchmark problems of an annual reachability competition for NNCS.",

    "abstract": "Few-shot classification tasks aim to classify images in query sets based on\nonly a few labeled examples in support sets. Most studies usually assume that\neach image in a task has a single and unique class association. Under these\nassumptions, these algorithms may not be able to identify the proper class\nassignment when there is no exact matching between support and query classes.\nFor example, given a few images of lions, bikes, and apples to classify a\ntiger. However, in a more general setting, we could consider the higher-level\nconcept of large carnivores to match the tiger to the lion for semantic\nclassification. Existing studies rarely considered this situation due to the\nincompatibility of label-based supervision with complex conception\nrelationships. In this work, we advanced the few-shot learning towards this\nmore challenging scenario, the semantic-based few-shot learning, and proposed a\nmethod to address the paradigm by capturing the inner semantic relationships\nusing interactive psychometric learning. We evaluate our method on the\nCIFAR-100 dataset. The results show the merits of our proposed method.",

In the design of 3D-TSV, several perceptual\nchallenges have been addressed when simultaneously visualizing three mutually\northogonal stress directions via lines. We present a novel algorithm for\ngenerating a space-filling and evenly spaced set of mutually orthogonal lines.\nThe algorithm further considers the locations of lines to obtain a more regular\npattern repetition, and enables the extraction of a Focus+Context\nrepresentation with user-selected levels of detail for individual stress\ndirections. To further reduce visual clutter, the system provides the combined\nvisualization of two selected principal directions via appropriately oriented\nribbons. The rendering uses depth cues to better convey the spatial\nrelationships between trajectories and improves ribbon rendering on steep\nangles. 3D-TSV is accessible to end users via a C++- and OpenGL-based rendering\nfrontend that is seamlessly connected to a MATLAB-based extraction backend.

To take advantage of forage resources and improve land\nproductivity, we require knowledge of pastureland growth patterns that is\nsimply unavailable at state of the art. In this paper, we propose to deploy a\nteam of robots to monitor the evolution of an unknown pastureland environment\nto fulfill the above goal. To monitor such an environment, which usually\nevolves slowly, we need to design a strategy for rapid assessment of the\nenvironment over large areas at a low cost. Thus, we propose an integrated\npipeline comprising of data synthesis, deep neural network training and\nprediction along with a multi-robot deployment algorithm that monitors\npasturelands intermittently. Specifically, using expert-informed agricultural\ndata coupled with novel data synthesis in ROS Gazebo, we first propose a new\nneural network architecture to learn the spatiotemporal dynamics of the\nenvironment. Such predictions help us to understand pastureland growth patterns\non large scales and make appropriate monitoring decisions for the future. Based\non our predictions, we then design an intermittent multi-robot deployment\npolicy for low-cost monitoring. Finally, we compare the proposed pipeline with\nother methods, from data synthesis to prediction and planning, to corroborate\nour pipeline's performance.",

    "abstract": "There have been two streams in the 3D detection from point clouds:\nsingle-stage methods and two-stage methods. While the former is more\ncomputationally efficient, the latter usually provides better detection\naccuracy. By carefully examining the two-stage approaches, we have found that\nif appropriately designed, the first stage can produce accurate box regression.\nIn this scenario, the second stage mainly rescores the boxes such that the\nboxes with better localization get selected. From this observation, we have\ndevised a single-stage anchor-free network that can fulfill these requirements.\nThis network, named AFDetV2, extends the previous work by incorporating a\nself-calibrated convolution block in the backbone, a keypoint auxiliary\nsupervision, and an IoU prediction branch in the multi-task head. As a result,\nthe detection accuracy is drastically boosted in the single-stage. To evaluate\nour approach, we have conducted extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset\nand the nuScenes Dataset. We have observed that our AFDetV2 achieves the\nstate-of-the-art results on these two datasets, superior to all the prior arts,\nincluding both the single-stage and the two-stage se3D detectors. AFDetV2 won\nthe 1st place in the Real-Time 3D Detection of the Waymo Open Dataset Challenge\n2021. In addition, a variant of our model AFDetV2-Base was entitled the \"Most\nEfficient Model\" by the Challenge Sponsor, showing a superior computational\nefficiency. To demonstrate the generality of this single-stage method, we have\nalso applied it to the first stage of the two-stage networks. Without\nexception, the results show that with the strengthened backbone and the\nrescoring approach, the second stage refinement is no longer needed.",

Motivated by recent advancements\nin robotic manipulation of deformable objects, this paper addresses these\nchallenges by constructing a method for automated stability testing of a\nslender elastic rod -- a canonical example of a deformable object -- using a\nrobotic system. We focus on rod configurations with helical centerlines since\nthe stability of a helical rod can be described using only three parameters,\nbut experimentally determining the stability requires manipulation of both the\nposition and orientation at one end of the rod, which is not possible using\ntraditional experimental methods that only actuate a limited number of degrees\nof freedom. Using a recent geometric characterization of stability for helical\nrods, we construct and implement a manipulation scheme to explore the space of\nstable helices, and we use a vision system to detect the onset of instabilities\nwithin this space. The experimental results obtained by our automated testing\nsystem show good agreement with numerical simulations of elastic rods in\nhelical configurations.

    "abstract": "Sparse coding with an $l_1$ penalty and a learned linear dictionary requires\nregularization of the dictionary to prevent a collapse in the $l_1$ norms of\nthe codes. Typically, this regularization entails bounding the Euclidean norms\nof the dictionary's elements. In this work, we propose a novel sparse coding\nprotocol which prevents a collapse in the codes without the need to regularize\nthe decoder. Our method regularizes the codes directly so that each latent code\ncomponent has variance greater than a fixed threshold over a set of sparse\nrepresentations for a given set of inputs. Furthermore, we explore ways to\neffectively train sparse coding systems with multi-layer decoders since they\ncan model more complex relationships than linear dictionaries. In our\nexperiments with MNIST and natural image patches, we show that decoders learned\nwith our approach have interpretable features both in the linear and\nmulti-layer case. Moreover, we show that sparse autoencoders with multi-layer\ndecoders trained using our variance regularization method produce higher\nquality reconstructions with sparser representations when compared to\nautoencoders with linear dictionaries.

    "abstract": "Existing neural networks for computer vision tasks are vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks: adding imperceptible perturbations to the input images can\nfool these methods to make a false prediction on an image that was correctly\npredicted without the perturbation. Various defense methods have proposed\nimage-to-image mapping methods, either including these perturbations in the\ntraining process or removing them in a preprocessing denoising step. In doing\nso, existing methods often ignore that the natural RGB images in today's\ndatasets are not captured but, in fact, recovered from RAW color filter array\ncaptures that are subject to various degradations in the capture. In this work,\nwe exploit this RAW data distribution as an empirical prior for adversarial\ndefense. Specifically, we proposed a model-agnostic adversarial defensive\nmethod, which maps the input RGB images to Bayer RAW space and back to output\nRGB using a learned camera image signal processing (ISP) pipeline to eliminate\npotential adversarial patterns. The proposed method acts as an off-the-shelf\npreprocessing module and, unlike model-specific adversarial training methods,\ndoes not require adversarial images to train. As a result, the method\ngeneralizes to unseen tasks without additional retraining. Experiments on\nlarge-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet, COCO) for different vision tasks (e.g.,\nclassification, semantic segmentation, object detection) validate that the\nmethod significantly outperforms existing methods across task domains.",

Today, transactions involving\ndigital documents are more likely to start as mobile phone photo uploads taken\nby non-professionals. As such, computer vision for document automation must now\naccount for documents captured in natural scene contexts. An additional\nchallenge is that task objectives for document processing can be highly\nuse-case specific, which makes publicly-available datasets limited in their\nutility, while manual data labeling is also costly and poorly translates\nbetween use cases.\nTo address these issues we created Sim2Real Docs - a framework for\nsynthesizing datasets and performing domain randomization of documents in\nnatural scenes. Sim2Real Docs enables programmatic 3D rendering of documents\nusing Blender, an open source tool for 3D modeling and ray-traced rendering. By\nusing rendering that simulates physical interactions of light, geometry,\ncamera, and background, we synthesize datasets of documents in a natural scene\ncontext. Each render is paired with use-case specific ground truth data\nspecifying latent characteristics of interest, producing unlimited fit-for-task\ntraining data. The role of machine learning models is then to solve the inverse\nproblem posed by the rendering pipeline.

In general, the\nBCI system requires a calibration procedure to tune the model every time the\nsystem is used. This problem is recognized as a major obstacle to BCI, and to\novercome it, approaches based on transfer learning (TL) have recently emerged.\nHowever, many BCI paradigms are limited in that they consist of a structure\nthat shows labels first and then measures \"imagery\", the negative effects of\nsource subjects containing data that do not contain control signals have been\nignored in many cases of the subject-to-subject TL process. The main purpose of\nthis paper is to propose a method of excluding subjects that are expected to\nhave a negative impact on subject-to-subject TL training, which generally uses\ndata from as many subjects as possible. In this paper, we proposed a BCI\nframework using only high-confidence subjects for TL training. In our\nframework, a deep neural network selects useful subjects for the TL process and\nexcludes noisy subjects, using a co-teaching algorithm based on the small-loss\ntrick. We experimented with leave-one-subject-out validation on two public\ndatasets (2020 international BCI competition track 4 and OpenBMI dataset). Our\nexperimental results showed that confidence-aware TL, which selects subjects\nwith small loss instances, improves the generalization performance of BCI.",

However, the end-to-end process for\napplying DL is not trivial. It requires grappling with problem formulation and\ncontext understanding, data engineering, model development, deployment,\ncontinuous monitoring and maintenance, and so on. Moreover, each of these steps\ntypically relies heavily on humans, in terms of both knowledge and\ninteractions, which impedes the further advancement and democratization of DL.\nConsequently, in response to these issues, a new field has emerged over the\nlast few years: automated deep learning (AutoDL). This endeavor seeks to\nminimize the need for human involvement and is best known for its achievements\nin neural architecture search (NAS), a topic that has been the focus of several\nsurveys. That stated, NAS is not the be-all and end-all of AutoDL. Accordingly,\nthis review adopts an overarching perspective, examining research efforts into\nautomation across the entirety of an archetypal DL workflow. In so doing, this\nwork also proposes a comprehensive set of ten criteria by which to assess\nexisting work in both individual publications and broader research areas. These\ncriteria are: novelty, solution quality, efficiency, stability,\ninterpretability, reproducibility, engineering quality, scalability,\ngeneralizability, and eco-friendliness. Thus, ultimately, this review provides\nan evaluative overview of AutoDL in the early 2020s, identifying where future\nopportunities for progress may exist.",

In this paper we\nanswer this question. In fact, we consider the generalized problem of finding\n$c$-disconnected matchings; such matchings are ones whose vertex sets induce\nsubgraphs with at least $c$ connected components. We show that, for every fixed\n$c \\geq 2$, this problem is NP-complete even if we restrict the input to\nbounded diameter bipartite graphs, while can be solved in polynomial time if $c\n= 1$. For the case when $c$ is part of the input, we show that the problem is\nNP-complete for chordal graphs, while being solvable in polynomial time for\ninterval graphs. Finally, we explore the parameterized complexity of the\nproblem. We present an FPT algorithm under the treewidth parameterization, and\nan XP algorithm for graphs with a polynomial number of minimal separators when\nparameterized by $c$. We complement these results by showing that, unless NP\n$\\subseteq$ coNP/poly, the related Induced Matching problem does not admit a\npolynomial kernel when parameterized by vertex cover and size of the matching\nnor when parameterized by vertex deletion distance to clique and size of the\nmatching. As for Connected Matching, we show how to obtain a maximum connected\nmatching in linear time given an arbitrary maximum matching in the input.",

However, existing\nalignment techniques often assume that the input KGs are complete and\nisomorphic, which is not true due to the real-world heterogeneity in the\ndomain, size, and sparsity. In this work, we address the problem of aligning\nincomplete KGs with representation learning. Our KG embedding framework\nexploits two feature channels: transitivity-based and proximity-based. The\nformer captures the consistency constraints between entities via translation\npaths, while the latter captures the neighbourhood structure of KGs via\nattention guided relation-aware graph neural network. The two feature channels\nare jointly learned to exchange important features between the input KGs while\nenforcing the output representations of the input KGs in the same embedding\nspace. Also, we develop a missing links detector that discovers and recovers\nthe missing links in the input KGs during the training process, which helps\nmitigate the incompleteness issue and thus improve the compatibility of the\nlearned representations. The embeddings then are fused to generate the\nalignment result, and the high-confidence matched node pairs are updated to the\npre-aligned supervision data to improve the embeddings gradually. Empirical\nresults show that our model is up to 15.2\\% more accurate than the SOTA and is\nrobust against different levels of incompleteness.

We introduce a new, more principled approach to\nadversarial training based on a closed form solution of an upper bound of the\nadversarial loss, which can be effectively trained with backpropagation. This\nbound is facilitated by state-of-the-art tools from robust optimization. We\nderive two new methods with our approach. The first method (Approximated Robust\nUpper Bound or aRUB) uses the first order approximation of the network as well\nas basic tools from linear robust optimization to obtain an approximate upper\nbound of the adversarial loss that can be easily implemented. The second method\n(Robust Upper Bound or RUB), computes an exact upper bound of the adversarial\nloss. Across a variety of tabular and vision data sets we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our more principled approach -- RUB is substantially more\nrobust than state-of-the-art methods for larger perturbations, while aRUB\nmatches the performance of state-of-the-art methods for small perturbations.\nAlso, both RUB and aRUB run faster than standard adversarial training (at the\nexpense of an increase in memory).

    "abstract": "Upgrading the existing analog instrumentation and control (IC) systems to\nstate-of-the-art digital IC (DIC) systems will greatly benefit existing\nlight-water reactors (LWRs). However, the issue of software common cause\nfailure (CCF) remains an obstacle in terms of qualification for digital\ntechnologies. Existing analyses of CCFs in I&C systems mainly focus on hardware\nfailures. With the application and upgrading of new DIC systems, design flaws\ncould cause software CCFs to become a potential threat to plant safety,\nconsidering that most redundancy designs use similar digital platforms or\nsoftware in their operating and application systems. With complex multi-layer\nredundancy designs to meet the single failure criterion, these IC safety\nsystems are of particular concern in U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)\nlicensing procedures. In Fiscal Year 2019, the Risk-Informed Systems Analysis\n(RISA) Pathway of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Light Water Reactor\nSustainability (LWRS) Program initiated a project to develop a risk assessment\nstrategy for delivering a strong technical basis to support effective,\nlicensable, and secure DIC technologies for digital upgrades and designs. An\nintegrated risk assessment for the DIC (IRADIC) process was proposed for this\nstrategy to identify potential key digital-induced failures, implement\nreliability analyses of related digital safety IC systems, and evaluate the\nunanalyzed sequences introduced by these failures (particularly software CCFs)\nat the plant level. This paper summarizes these RISA efforts in the risk\nanalysis of safety-related DIC systems at Idaho National Laboratory.",

Our experiments show that the proposed neural\nclassifiers are competitive and some achieve better performance than previous\nstate of the art traditional machine learning methods without the need for\nfeature engineering.

    "abstract": "In recent years, person detection and human pose estimation have made great\nstrides, helped by large-scale labeled datasets. However, these datasets had no\nguarantees or analysis of human activities, poses, or context diversity.\nAdditionally, privacy, legal, safety, and ethical concerns may limit the\nability to collect more human data. An emerging alternative to real-world data\nthat alleviates some of these issues is synthetic data. However, creation of\nsynthetic data generators is incredibly challenging and prevents researchers\nfrom exploring their usefulness. Therefore, we release a human-centric\nsynthetic data generator PeopleSansPeople which contains simulation-ready 3D\nhuman assets, a parameterized lighting and camera system, and generates 2D and\n3D bounding box, instance and semantic segmentation, and COCO pose labels.\nUsing PeopleSansPeople, we performed benchmark synthetic data training using a\nDetectron2 Keypoint R-CNN variant [1]. We found that pre-training a network\nusing synthetic data and fine-tuning on target real-world data (few-shot\ntransfer to limited subsets of COCO-person train [2]) resulted in a keypoint AP\nof $60.37 \\pm 0.48$ (COCO test-dev2017) outperforming models trained with the\nsame real data alone (keypoint AP of $55.80$) and pre-trained with ImageNet\n(keypoint AP of $57.50$).

    "abstract": "With the development of key technologies like environment perception, the\nautomation level of autonomous vehicles has been increasing. However, before\nreaching highly autonomous driving, manual driving still needs to participate\nin the driving process to ensure the safety of human-vehicle shared driving.\nThe existing human-vehicle cooperative driving focuses on auto engineering and\ndrivers' behaviors, with few research studies in the field of visual\nperception. Due to the bad performance in the complex road traffic conflict\nscenarios, cooperative visual perception needs to be studied further. In\naddition, the autonomous driving perception system cannot correctly understand\nthe characteristics of manual driving. Based on the background above, this\npaper directly proposes a human-vehicle cooperative visual perception method to\nenhance the visual perception ability of shared autonomous driving based on the\ntransfer learning method and the image fusion algorithm for the complex road\ntraffic scenarios. Based on transfer learning, the mAP of object detection\nreaches 75.52% and lays a solid foundation for visual fusion. And the fusion\nexperiment further reveals that human-vehicle cooperative visual perception\nreflects the riskiest zone and predicts the conflict object's trajectory more\nprecisely. This study pioneers a cooperative visual perception solution for\nshared autonomous driving and experiments in real-world complex traffic\nconflict scenarios, which can better support the following planning and\ncontrolling and improve the safety of autonomous vehicles.",

Specifically, we first replace the patchify stem (i.e., image\nsplitting and embedding) of the ViT model with a lightweight image encoder\nmodelled by a convolutional neural network. The compressed features generated\nby the image encoder are injected convolutional inductive bias and are fed to\nthe Transformer for image classification bypassing image reconstruction.\nMeanwhile, we propose a feature aggregation module to fuse the compressed\nfeatures with the selected intermediate features of the Transformer, and feed\nthe aggregated features to a deconvolutional neural network for image\nreconstruction. The aggregated features can obtain the long-term information\nfrom the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer and improve the\ncompression performance. The rate-distortion-accuracy optimization problem is\nfinally solved by a two-step training strategy.

    "abstract": "As a startup company in the autonomous driving space, we have undergone four\nyears of painful experiences dealing with a broad spectrum of regulatory\nrequirements. Compared to the software industry norm, which spends 13% of their\noverall budget on compliances, we were forced to spend 42% of our budget on\ncompliances. Our situation is not alone and, in a way, reflects the dilemma of\nthe artificial intelligence (AI) regulatory landscape. The root cause is the\nlack of AI expertise in the legislative and executive branches, leading to a\nlack of standardization for the industry to follow. In this article, we share\nour first-hand experiences and advocate for the establishment of an FDA-like\nagency to regulate AI properly.",

    "abstract": "The increasing adoption of facial processing systems in India is fraught with\nconcerns of privacy, transparency, accountability, and missing procedural\nsafeguards. At the same time, we also know very little about how these\ntechnologies perform on the diverse features, characteristics, and skin tones\nof India's 1.34 billion-plus population. In this paper, we test the face\ndetection and facial analysis functions of four commercial facial processing\ntools on a dataset of Indian faces. The tools display varying error rates in\nthe face detection and gender and age classification functions. The gender\nclassification error rate for Indian female faces is consistently higher\ncompared to that of males -- the highest female error rate being 14.68%. In\nsome cases, this error rate is much higher than that shown by previous studies\nfor females of other nationalities. Age classification errors are also high.\nDespite taking into account an acceptable error margin of plus or minus 10\nyears from a person's actual age, age prediction failures are in the range of\n14.3% to 42.2%. These findings point to the limited accuracy of facial\nprocessing tools, particularly for certain demographic groups, and the need for\nmore critical thinking before adopting such systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel collaborative generative modeling (CGM) framework\nthat incentivizes collaboration among self-interested parties to contribute\ndata to a pool for training a generative model (e.g., GAN), from which\nsynthetic data are drawn and distributed to the parties as rewards commensurate\nto their contributions. Distributing synthetic data as rewards (instead of\ntrained models or money) offers task- and model-agnostic benefits for\ndownstream learning tasks and is less likely to violate data privacy\nregulation. To realize the framework, we firstly propose a data valuation\nfunction using maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) that values data based on its\nquantity and quality in terms of its closeness to the true data distribution\nand provide theoretical results guiding the kernel choice in our MMD-based data\nvaluation function. Then, we formulate the reward scheme as a linear\noptimization problem that when solved, guarantees certain incentives such as\nfairness in the CGM framework. We devise a weighted sampling algorithm for\ngenerating synthetic data to be distributed to each party as reward such that\nthe value of its data and the synthetic data combined matches its assigned\nreward value by the reward scheme. We empirically show using simulated and\nreal-world datasets that the parties' synthetic data rewards are commensurate\nto their contributions.",

In this work, we jointly\noptimize the task partitioning and computational power allocation for\ncomputation offloading in a dynamic environment with multiple IoT devices and\nmultiple edge servers. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process\nwith constrained hybrid action space, which cannot be well handled by existing\ndeep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms.

One important yet unsolved issue for learning on point cloud is that\npoint clouds of the same object can have significant geometric variations if\ngenerated using different procedures or captured using different sensors. These\ninconsistencies induce domain gaps such that neural networks trained on one\ndomain may fail to generalize on others. A typical technique to reduce the\ndomain gap is to perform adversarial training so that point clouds in the\nfeature space can align. However, adversarial training is easy to fall into\ndegenerated local minima, resulting in negative adaptation gains. Here we\npropose a simple yet effective method for unsupervised domain adaptation on\npoint clouds by employing a self-supervised task of learning geometry-aware\nimplicits, which plays two critical roles in one shot. First, the geometric\ninformation in the point clouds is preserved through the implicit\nrepresentations for downstream tasks. More importantly, the domain-specific\nvariations can be effectively learned away in the implicit space. We also\npropose an adaptive strategy to compute unsigned distance fields for arbitrary\npoint clouds due to the lack of shape models in practice. When combined with a\ntask loss, the proposed outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain\nadaptation methods that rely on adversarial domain alignment and more\ncomplicated self-supervised tasks.

It is well acknowledged\nthat step asynchronism leads to objective inconsistency under non-i.i.d. data,\nwhich degrades the model accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a new\nalgorithm \\texttt{FedaGrac}, which calibrates the local direction to a\npredictive global orientation. Taking the advantage of estimated orientation,\nwe guarantee that the aggregated model does not excessively deviate from the\nexpected orientation while fully utilizing the local updates of faster nodes.\nWe theoretically prove that \\texttt{FedaGrac} holds an improved order of\nconvergence rate than the state-of-the-art approaches and eliminates the\nnegative effect of step asynchronism.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) opens up huge opportunities for better\nutilizing unlabeled data. It is essential for medical image analysis that is\ngenerally known for its lack of annotations. However, when we attempt to use as\nmany as possible unlabeled medical images in SSL, breaking the dimension\nbarrier (\\ie, making it possible to jointly use both 2D and 3D images) becomes\na must. In this paper, we propose a Universal Self-Supervised Transformer\n(USST) framework based on the student-teacher paradigm, aiming to leverage a\nhuge of unlabeled medical data with multiple dimensions to learn rich\nrepresentations. To achieve this, we design a Pyramid Transformer U-Net (PTU)\nas the backbone, which is composed of switchable patch embedding (SPE) layers\nand Transformer layers. The SPE layer switches to either 2D or 3D patch\nembedding depending on the input dimension. After that, the images are\nconverted to a sequence regardless of their original dimensions. The\nTransformer layer then models the long-term dependencies in a\nsequence-to-sequence manner, thus enabling USST to learn representations from\nboth 2D and 3D images. USST has two obvious merits compared to current\ndimension-specific SSL: (1) \\textbf{more effective} - can learn representations\nfrom more and diverse data; and (2) \\textbf{more versatile} - can be\ntransferred to various downstream tasks. The results show that USST provides\npromising results on six 2D/3D medical image classification and segmentation\ntasks, outperforming the supervised ImageNet pre-training and advanced SSL\ncounterparts substantially.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis is one of the most common mind-altering substances. It is used both\nmedicinally and recreationally and is enmeshed in a complex and changing legal\nlandscape. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some software developers may use\ncannabis to aid some programming tasks. At the same time, anti-drug policies\nand tests remain common in many software engineering environments, sometimes\nleading to hiring shortages for certain jobs. Despite these connections, little\nis actually known about the prevalence of, and motivation for, cannabis use\nwhile programming. In this paper, we report the results of the first\nlarge-scale survey of cannabis use by programmers. We report findings about 803\ndevelopers' (including 450 full-time programmers') cannabis usage prevalence,\nperceptions, and motivations. For example, we find that some programmers do\nregularly use cannabis while programming: 35% of our sample has tried\nprogramming while using cannabis, and 18% currently do so at least once a\nmonth. Furthermore, this cannabis usage is primarily motivated by a perceived\nenhancement to certain software development skills (such as brainstorming or\ngetting into a programming zone) rather than medicinal reasons (such as pain\nrelief). Finally, we find that cannabis use while programming occurs at similar\nrates for programming employees, managers, and students despite differences in\ncannabis perceptions and visibility. Our results have implications for\nprogramming job drug policies and motivate future research into cannabis use\nwhile programming.",

This\nis particularly important in Singapore, being one of the world's most densely\npopulated countries, which is why the Singaporean authorities are currently\nactively facilitating the deployment of AVs. As a consequence, however, the\nneed arises for a formal AV road approval procedure. To this end, a safety\nassessment framework is proposed, which combines aspects of the standardized\nfunctional safety design methodology with a traffic scenario-based approach.\nThe latter involves using driving data to extract AV-relevant traffic\nscenarios. The underlying approach is based on decomposition of scenarios into\nelementary events, subsequent scenario parametrization, and sampling of the\nestimated probability density functions of the scenario parameters to create\ntest scenarios. The resulting test scenarios are subsequently employed for\nvirtual testing in a simulation environment and physical testing on a proving\nground and in real life. As a result, the proposed assessment pipeline thus\nprovides statistically relevant and quantitative measures for the AV\nperformance in a relatively short time frame due to the simulation-based\napproach. Ultimately, the proposed methodology provides authorities with a\nformal road approval procedure for AVs. In particular, the proposed methodology\nwill support the Singaporean Land Transport Authority for road approval of AVs.",

However, it\nis possible that the target is inaccurately predicted due to the gradient\nshrinkage problem of the original loss function of the ENet, the negative log\nmarginal likelihood (NLL) loss. In this paper, the objective is to improve the\nprediction accuracy of the ENet while maintaining its efficient uncertainty\nestimation by resolving the gradient shrinkage problem. A multi-task learning\n(MTL) framework, referred to as MT-ENet, is proposed to accomplish this aim. In\nthe MTL, we define the Lipschitz modified mean squared error (MSE) loss\nfunction as another loss and add it to the existing NLL loss. The Lipschitz\nmodified MSE loss is designed to mitigate the gradient conflict with the NLL\nloss by dynamically adjusting its Lipschitz constant. By doing so, the\nLipschitz MSE loss does not disturb the uncertainty estimation of the NLL loss.\nThe MT-ENet enhances the predictive accuracy of the ENet without losing\nuncertainty estimation capability on the synthetic dataset and real-world\nbenchmarks, including drug-target affinity (DTA) regression.

    "abstract": "The min-entropy is a widely used metric to quantify the randomness of\ngenerated random numbers, which measures the difficulty of guessing the most\nlikely output. It is difficult to accurately estimate the min-entropy of a\nnon-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) source. Hence, NIST\nSpecial Publication (SP) 800-90B adopts ten different min-entropy estimators\nand then conservatively selects the minimum value among ten min-entropy\nestimates. Among these estimators, the longest repeated substring (LRS)\nestimator estimates the collision entropy instead of the min-entropy by\ncounting the number of repeated substrings. Since the collision entropy is an\nupper bound on the min-entropy, the LRS estimator inherently provides\n\\emph{overestimated} outputs. In this paper, we propose two techniques to\nestimate the min-entropy of a non-IID source accurately. The first technique\nresolves the overestimation problem by translating the collision entropy into\nthe min-entropy. Next, we generalize the LRS estimator by adopting the general\nR{\\'{e}}nyi entropy instead of the collision entropy (i.e., R{\\'{e}}nyi entropy\nof order two). We show that adopting a higher order can reduce the variance of\nmin-entropy estimates. By integrating these techniques, we propose a\ngeneralized LRS estimator that effectively resolves the overestimation problem\nand provides stable min-entropy estimates. Theoretical analysis and empirical\nresults support that the proposed generalized LRS estimator improves the\nestimation accuracy significantly, which makes it an appealing alternative to\nthe LRS estimator.",

Their main interests are a\nlarge capacity and a low price per gigabyte, which come at the cost of a much\nlarger file access time than on disks. With tapes, finding the right ordering\nof multiple file accesses is thus key to performance. Moving the reading head\nback and forth along a kilometer long tape has a non-negligible cost and\nunnecessary movements thus have to be avoided. However, the optimization of\ntape request ordering has then rarely been studied in the scheduling\nliterature, much less than I/O scheduling on disks. For instance, minimizing\nthe average service time for several read requests on a linear tape remains an\nopen question. Therefore, in this paper, we aim at improving the quality of\nservice experienced by users of tape storage systems, and not only the peak\nperformance of such systems. To this end, we propose a reasonable\npolynomial-time exact algorithm while this problem and simpler variants have\nbeen conjectured NP-hard. We also refine the proposed model by considering\nU-turn penalty costs accounting for inherent mechanical accelerations. Then, we\npropose a low-cost variant of our optimal algorithm by restricting the solution\nspace, yet still yielding an accurate suboptimal solution. Finally, we compare\nour algorithms to existing solutions from the literature on logs of the mass\nstorage management system of a major datacenter.

    "title": "Can Machine Learning Tools Support the Identification of Sustainable  Design Leads From Product Reviews? Opportunities and Challenges",
    "abstract": "The increasing number of product reviews posted online is a gold mine for\ndesigners to know better about the products they develop, by capturing the\nvoice of customers, and to improve these products accordingly. In the meantime,\nproduct design and development have an essential role in creating a more\nsustainable future. With the recent advance of artificial intelligence\ntechniques in the field of natural language processing, this research aims to\ndevelop an integrated machine learning solution to obtain sustainable design\ninsights from online product reviews automatically. In this paper, the\nopportunities and challenges offered by existing frameworks - including Python\nlibraries, packages, as well as state-of-the-art algorithms like BERT - are\ndiscussed, illustrated, and positioned along an ad hoc machine learning\nprocess. This contribution discusses the opportunities to reach and the\nchallenges to address for building a machine learning pipeline, in order to get\ninsights from product reviews to design more sustainable products, including\nthe five following stages, from the identification of sustainability-related\nreviews to the interpretation of sustainable design leads: data collection,\ndata formatting, model training, model evaluation, and model deployment.\nExamples of sustainable design insights that can be produced out of product\nreview mining and processing are given. Finally, promising lines for future\nresearch in the field are provided, including case studies putting in parallel\nstandard products with their sustainable alternatives, to compare the features\nvalued by customers and to generate in fine relevant sustainable design leads.",

By pushing server resources\nto the edge, mobile service providers can deliver their content and services\nwith enhanced performance, and mobile-network carriers can alleviate congestion\nin the core networks. Although edge computing has been attracting much\ninterest, most current research is application-specific, and analysis is\nlacking from a business perspective of edge cloud providers (ECPs) that provide\ngeneral-purpose edge cloud services to mobile service providers and users. In\nthis article, we present a vision of general-purpose edge computing realized by\nmultiple interconnected edge clouds, analyzing the business model from the\nviewpoint of ECPs and identifying the main issues to address to maximize\nbenefits for ECPs. Specifically, we formalize the long-term revenue of ECPs as\na function of server-resource allocation and public data-placement decisions\nsubject to the amount of physical resources and inter-cloud data-transportation\ncost constraints. To optimize the long-term objective, we propose an online\nframework that integrates the drift-plus-penalty and primal-dual methods.

In\norder to produce such contents to support a large applications (e.g.,\ne-commerce), the field of artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered persuasive\nvideo generation (AIPVG) has gained traction in recent years. This field is\ninterdisciplinary in nature, which makes it challenging for new researchers to\ngrasp. Currently, there is no comprehensive survey of AIPVG available. In this\npaper, we bridge this gap by reviewing key AI techniques that can be utilized\nto automatically generate persuasive videos. We offer a first-of-its-kind\ntaxonomy which divides AIPVG into three major steps: 1) visual material\nunderstanding, which extracts information from the visual materials (VMs)\nrelevant to the target of promotion; 2) visual storyline generation, which\nshortlists and arranges high-quality VMs into a sequence in order to compose a\nstoryline with persuasive power; and 3) post-production, which involves\nbackground music generation and still image animation to enhance viewing\nexperience. We also introduce the evaluation metrics and datasets commonly\nadopted in the field of AIPVG.

Understanding the actual interactivity and behaviour of those users is\nstill an open challenge and a key step to enable such a user-centric system.\nOur main goal is to enable user behavioural analysis in the case of 6\ndegree-of-freedom (DoF) systems by extending the applicability of existing\nbehavioural methodologies adopted for studying user behaviour in 3-DoF\nsettings. Specifically, we deeply analyse 6-DoF navigation patterns with\ncomparisons to the 3-DoF counterpart. Then, we define new metrics aimed at\nbetter modelling users similarities in a 6-DoF system. We validate and test our\nsolutions on real navigation paths of users while displaying dynamic volumetric\nmedia in 6-DoF Virtual Reality conditions. To show the flexibility and\ngenerality of our proposed metrics, we also test their performance on\nnavigation trajectories collected in a 6-DoF Augmented Reality settings. Our\nresults show that metrics that consider both user position and viewing\ndirection better perform in detecting user similarity while navigating in a\n6-DoF system. Having easy-to-use but robust metrics that underpin multiple\ntools and answer the question \"how do I detect if two users look at the same\ncontent?\" open the gate to new solutions for a user-centric system.",

    "abstract": "LoRa is a popular wireless technology that enables low-throughput (bytes)\nlong-range communication (km) at low energy consumption (mW). Its transmission,\nthough, is on one side prone to interference during long on-air times, and on\nthe other side subject to duty cycle restrictions. LoRaWAN defines a MAC and a\nvertical stack on top of LoRa. LoRaWAN circumvents the above limitations by\nimposing a centralized network architecture, which heavily reduces downlink\ncapacity and prevents peer-to-peer communication. This makes it unusable for\nmany deployments. The Deterministic and Synchronous Multichannel Extension\n(DSME) of IEEE 802.15.4e benefits of time-slotted communication and\npeer-to-peer communication and has the potential to overcome LoRaWAN\nlimitations. In this work, we implement DSME on top of LoRa in the open source\nIoT OS RIOT and open the field for first evaluation experiments on real\nhardware. Initial results indicate that DSME-LoRa not only enables reliable\npeer-to-peer communication for constrained IoT devices, but also scales with an\nincreasing number of nodes.",

    "abstract": "The distributed inference (DI) framework has gained traction as a technique\nfor real-time applications empowered by cutting-edge deep machine learning (ML)\non resource-constrained Internet of things (IoT) devices. In DI, computational\ntasks are offloaded from the IoT device to the edge server via lossy IoT\nnetworks. However, generally, there is a communication system-level trade-off\nbetween communication latency and reliability; thus, to provide accurate DI\nresults, a reliable and high-latency communication system is required to be\nadapted, which results in non-negligible end-to-end latency of the DI. This\nmotivated us to improve the trade-off between the communication latency and\naccuracy by efforts on ML techniques. Specifically, we have proposed a\ncommunication-oriented model tuning (COMtune), which aims to achieve highly\naccurate DI with low-latency but unreliable communication links. In COMtune,\nthe key idea is to fine-tune the ML model by emulating the effect of unreliable\ncommunication links through the application of the dropout technique. This\nenables the DI system to obtain robustness against unreliable communication\nlinks. Our ML experiments revealed that COMtune enables accurate predictions\nwith low latency and under lossy networks.",

Recent graph convolutional network\n(GCN) approaches have achieved great success for skeleton-based action\nrecognition since its grateful modeling ability of non-Euclidean data. GCN is\nable to utilize the short-range joint dependencies while lack to directly model\nthe distant joints relations that are vital to distinguishing various actions.\nThus, many GCN approaches try to employ hierarchical mechanism to aggregate\nwider-range neighborhood information. We propose a novel self-attention based\nskeleton-anchor proposal (SAP) module to comprehensively model the internal\nrelations of a human body for motion feature learning.

    "abstract": "By highlighting the regions of the input image that contribute the most to\nthe decision, saliency maps have become a popular method to make neural\nnetworks interpretable. In medical imaging, they are particularly well-suited\nto explain neural networks in the context of abnormality localization. However,\nfrom our experiments, they are less suited to classification problems where the\nfeatures that allow to distinguish between the different classes are spatially\ncorrelated, scattered and definitely non-trivial. In this paper we thus propose\na new paradigm for better interpretability. To this end we provide the user\nwith relevant and easily interpretable information so that he can form his own\nopinion. We use Disentangled Variational Auto-Encoders which latent\nrepresentation is divided into two components: the non-interpretable part and\nthe disentangled part. The latter accounts for the categorical variables\nexplicitly representing the different classes of interest. In addition to\nproviding the class of a given input sample, such a model offers the\npossibility to transform the sample from a given class to a sample of another\nclass, by modifying the value of the categorical variables in the latent\nrepresentation. This paves the way to easier interpretation of class\ndifferences. We illustrate the relevance of this approach in the context of\nautomatic sex determination from hip bones in forensic medicine.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel zero-shot multi-frame image restoration method for\nremoving unwanted obstruction elements (such as rains, snow, and moire\npatterns) that vary in successive frames. It has three stages: transformer\npre-training, zero-shot restoration, and hard patch refinement. Using the\npre-trained transformers, our model is able to tell the motion difference\nbetween the true image information and the obstructing elements. For zero-shot\nimage restoration, we design a novel model, termed SiamTrans, which is\nconstructed by Siamese transformers, encoders, and decoders. Each transformer\nhas a temporal attention layer and several self-attention layers, to capture\nboth temporal and spatial information of multiple frames. Only pre-trained\n(self-supervised) on the denoising task, SiamTrans is tested on three different\nlow-level vision tasks (deraining, demoireing, and desnowing). Compared with\nrelated methods, ours achieves the best performances, even outperforming those\nwith supervised learning.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the dynamics-aware adversarial attack problem\nin deep neural networks. Most existing adversarial attack algorithms are\ndesigned under a basic assumption -- the network architecture is fixed\nthroughout the attack process. However, this assumption does not hold for many\nrecently proposed networks, e.g. 3D sparse convolution network, which contains\ninput-dependent execution to improve computational efficiency. It results in a\nserious issue of lagged gradient, making the learned attack at the current step\nineffective due to the architecture changes afterward. To address this issue,\nwe propose a Leaded Gradient Method (LGM) and show the significant effects of\nthe lagged gradient. More specifically, we re-formulate the gradients to be\naware of the potential dynamic changes of network architectures, so that the\nlearned attack better \"leads\" the next step than the dynamics-unaware methods\nwhen network architecture changes dynamically. Extensive experiments on various\ndatasets show that our LGM achieves impressive performance on semantic\nsegmentation and classification. Compared with the dynamic-unaware methods, LGM\nachieves about 20% lower mIoU averagely on the ScanNet and S3DIS datasets. LGM\nalso outperforms the recent point cloud attacks.",

There are two senders with independent messages who transmit symbols\nacross an additive white Gaussian channel to a receiver, who in turn sends back\na symbol which is received by the two senders through two independent noisy\nGaussian channels. We consider the case when the feedback is active i.e. the\nreceiver actively encodes the feedback using a linear state process. We pose\nthis as a problem of linear sequential coding at the senders and the receiver\nto minimize the terminal mean square probability of error at the receiver. This\nis an instance of decentralized control with no common information at the\nsenders and the receiver. In this paper, we construct two linear controllers at\nthe sender and the receiver. Due to linearity of the policies and the\ncontrollers, all the random variables involved are jointly Gaussian. Moreover,\nthe corresponding covariance matrix at the receiver of the estimation process\nof the senders' messages is a deterministic process, which is a function of the\nparameters of the controllers and the strategies of the players, and is thus\nperfectly observed by the senders. Based on this observation, we use\ndeterministic dynamic programming to find the optimal policies and the optimal\nlinear controllers at both the senders and the receiver.

To verify the effectiveness of the\nproposed methodology, some theoretical and experimental analysis on\naccelerating the convergence and improving the performance is presented, and a\nseries of experiments are conducted based on various network models (such as\nAlexNet, VGGNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet and DenseNet), and various datasets (such as\nCIFAR10, CIFAR100, miniImageNet, PASCAL VOC and COCO) .

Most existing action\nrecognition models focus on learning overall visual cues of a scene but\ndisregard informative fine-grained features, which can be captured by learning\nhuman-object relationships and interactions. In this paper, we learn\nhuman-object relationships by exploiting the interaction of their local and\nglobal contexts. We hence propose the Global-Local Interaction Distillation\nNetwork (GLIDN), learning human and object interactions through space and time\nvia knowledge distillation for fine-grained scene understanding. GLIDN encodes\nhumans and objects into graph nodes and learns local and global relations via\ngraph attention network. The local context graphs learn the relation between\nhumans and objects at a frame level by capturing their co-occurrence at a\nspecific time step. The global relation graph is constructed based on the\nvideo-level of human and object interactions, identifying their long-term\nrelations throughout a video sequence. More importantly, we investigate how\nknowledge from these graphs can be distilled to their counterparts for\nimproving human-object interaction (HOI) recognition.

    "abstract": "We propose a new splitting method for strong numerical solution of the\nCox-Ingersoll-Ross model. For this method, applied over both deterministic and\nadaptive random meshes, we prove a uniform moment bound and strong error\nresults of order $1/4$ in $L_1$ and $L_2$ for the parameter regime\n$\\kappa\\theta>\\sigma^2$. Our scheme does not fall into the class analyzed in\nHefter & Herzwurm (2018) where convergence of maximum order $1/4$ of a novel\nclass of Milstein-based methods over the full range of parameter values is\nshown. Hence we present a separate convergence analysis before we extend the\nnew method to cover all parameter values by introducing a 'soft zero' region\n(where the deterministic flow determines the approximation) giving a hybrid\ntype method to deal with the reflecting boundary.\nFrom numerical simulations we observe a rate of order $1$ when\n$\\kappa\\theta>\\sigma^2$ rather than $1/4$. Asymptotically, for large noise, we\nobserve that the rates of convergence decrease similarly to those of other\nschemes but that the proposed method displays smaller error constants. Our\nresults also serve as supporting numerical evidence that the conjecture of\nHefter & Jentzen (2019) holds true for methods with non-uniform Wiener\nincrements.",

    "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a mental health disorder that causes mood swings that\nrange from depression to mania. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder is usually done\nbased on patient interviews, and reports obtained from the caregivers of the\npatients. Subsequently, the diagnosis depends on the experience of the expert,\nand it is possible to have confusions of the disorder with other mental\ndisorders. Automated processes in the diagnosis of bipolar disorder can help\nproviding quantitative indicators, and allow easier observations of the\npatients for longer periods. Furthermore, the need for remote treatment and\ndiagnosis became especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this\nthesis, we create a multimodal decision system based on recordings of the\npatient in acoustic, linguistic, and visual modalities. The system is trained\non the Bipolar Disorder corpus. Comprehensive analysis of unimodal and\nmultimodal systems, as well as various fusion techniques are performed. Besides\nprocessing entire patient sessions using unimodal features, a task-level\ninvestigation of the clips is studied. Using acoustic, linguistic, and visual\nfeatures in a multimodal fusion system, we achieved a 64.8% unweighted average\nrecall score, which improves the state-of-the-art performance achieved on this\ndataset.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on exploiting neural networks for the analysis and\nplanning stage in self-adaptive architectures. The studied motivating cases in\nthe paper involve existing (legacy) self-adaptive architectures and their\nadaptation logic, which has been specified by logical rules. We further assume\nthat there is a need to endow these systems with the ability to learn based on\nexamples of inputs and expected outputs. One simple option to address such a\nneed is to replace the reasoning based on logical rules with a neural network.\nHowever, this step brings several problems that often create at least a\ntemporary regress. The reason is the logical rules typically represent a large\nand tested body of domain knowledge, which may be lost if the logical rules are\nreplaced by a neural network. Further, the black-box nature of generic neural\nnetworks obfuscates how the systems work inside and consequently introduces\nmore uncertainty. In this paper, we present a method that makes it possible to\nendow an existing self-adaptive architectures with the ability to learn using\nneural networks, while preserving domain knowledge existing in the logical\nrules. We introduce a continuum between the existing rule-based system and a\nsystem based on a generic neural network. We show how to navigate in this\ncontinuum and create a neural network architecture that naturally embeds the\noriginal logical rules and how to gradually scale the learning potential of the\nnetwork, thus controlling the uncertainty inherent to all soft computing\nmodels. We showcase and evaluate the approach on representative excerpts from\ntwo larger real-life use cases.",

    "title": "Learning from Heterogeneous Data Based on Social Interactions over  Graphs",
    "abstract": "This work proposes a decentralized architecture, where individual agents aim\nat solving a classification problem while observing streaming features of\ndifferent dimensions and arising from possibly different distributions. In the\ncontext of social learning, several useful strategies have been developed,\nwhich solve decision making problems through local cooperation across\ndistributed agents and allow them to learn from streaming data. However,\ntraditional social learning strategies rely on the fundamental assumption that\neach agent has significant prior knowledge of the underlying distribution of\nthe observations. In this work we overcome this issue by introducing a machine\nlearning framework that exploits social interactions over a graph, leading to a\nfully data-driven solution to the distributed classification problem. In the\nproposed social machine learning (SML) strategy, two phases are present: in the\ntraining phase, classifiers are independently trained to generate a belief over\na set of hypotheses using a finite number of training samples; in the\nprediction phase, classifiers evaluate streaming unlabeled observations and\nshare their instantaneous beliefs with neighboring classifiers. We show that\nthe SML strategy enables the agents to learn consistently under this\nhighly-heterogeneous setting and allows the network to continue learning even\nduring the prediction phase when it is deciding on unlabeled samples. The\nprediction decisions are used to continually improve performance thereafter in\na manner that is markedly different from most existing static classification\nschemes where, following training, the decisions on unlabeled data are not\nre-used to improve future performance.",

    "abstract": "We consider an extension to the restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problem\nwith unknown arm dynamics, where an unknown exogenous global Markov process\ngoverns the rewards distribution of each arm. Under each global state, the\nrewards process of each arm evolves according to an unknown Markovian rule,\nwhich is non-identical among different arms. At each time, a player chooses an\narm out of $N$ arms to play, and receives a random reward from a finite set of\nreward states. The arms are restless, that is, their local state evolves\nregardless of the player's actions. Motivated by recent studies on related RMAB\nsettings, the regret is defined as the reward loss with respect to a player\nthat knows the dynamics of the problem, and plays at each time $t$ the arm that\nmaximizes the expected immediate value. The objective is to develop an\narm-selection policy that minimizes the regret. To that end, we develop the\nLearning under Exogenous Markov Process (LEMP) algorithm. We analyze LEMP\ntheoretically and establish a finite-sample bound on the regret. We show that\nLEMP achieves a logarithmic regret order with time. We further analyze LEMP\nnumerically and present simulation results that support the theoretical\nfindings and demonstrate that LEMP significantly outperforms alternative\nalgorithms.",

    "abstract": "Cognates are present in multiple variants of the same text across different\nlanguages (e.g., \"hund\" in German and \"hound\" in English language mean \"dog\").\nThey pose a challenge to various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications\nsuch as Machine Translation, Cross-lingual Sense Disambiguation, Computational\nPhylogenetics, and Information Retrieval. A possible solution to address this\nchallenge is to identify cognates across language pairs. In this paper, we\ndescribe the creation of two cognate datasets for twelve Indian languages,\nnamely Sanskrit, Hindi, Assamese, Oriya, Kannada, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu,\nPunjabi, Bengali, Marathi, and Malayalam. We digitize the cognate data from an\nIndian language cognate dictionary and utilize linked Indian language Wordnets\nto generate cognate sets. Additionally, we use the Wordnet data to create a\nFalse Friends' dataset for eleven language pairs. We also evaluate the efficacy\nof our dataset using previously available baseline cognate detection\napproaches. We also perform a manual evaluation with the help of lexicographers\nand release the curated gold-standard dataset with this paper.",

    "abstract": "The great success of deep learning is mainly due to the large-scale network\narchitecture and the high-quality training data. However, it is still\nchallenging to deploy recent deep models on portable devices with limited\nmemory and imaging ability. Some existing works have engaged to compress the\nmodel via knowledge distillation. Unfortunately, these methods cannot deal with\nimages with reduced image quality, such as the low-resolution (LR) images. To\nthis end, we make a pioneering effort to distill helpful knowledge from a heavy\nnetwork model learned from high-resolution (HR) images to a compact network\nmodel that will handle LR images, thus advancing the current knowledge\ndistillation technique with the novel pixel distillation. To achieve this goal,\nwe propose a Teacher-Assistant-Student (TAS) framework, which disentangles\nknowledge distillation into the model compression stage and the high resolution\nrepresentation transfer stage. By equipping a novel Feature Super Resolution\n(FSR) module, our approach can learn lightweight network model that can achieve\nsimilar accuracy as the heavy teacher model but with much fewer parameters,\nfaster inference speed, and lower-resolution inputs. Comprehensive experiments\non three widely-used benchmarks, \\ie, CUB-200-2011, PASCAL VOC 2007, and\nImageNetSub, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "We describe a model for polarization in multi-agent systems based on Esteban\nand Ray's standard measure of polarization from economics. Agents evolve by\nupdating their beliefs (opinions) based on an underlying influence graph, as in\nthe standard DeGroot model for social learning, but under a confirmation bias;\ni.e., a discounting of opinions of agents with dissimilar views. We show that\neven under this bias polarization eventually vanishes (converges to zero) if\nthe influence graph is strongly-connected. If the influence graph is a regular\nsymmetric circulation, we determine the unique belief value to which all agents\nconverge. Our more insightful result establishes that, under some natural\nassumptions, if polarization does not eventually vanish then either there is a\ndisconnected subgroup of agents, or some agent influences others more than she\nis influenced. We also prove that polarization does not necessarily vanish in\nweakly-connected graphs under confirmation bias. Furthermore, we show how our\nmodel relates to the classic DeGroot model for social learning. We illustrate\nour model with several simulations of a running example about polarization over\nvaccines and of other case studies. The theoretical results and simulations\nwill provide insight into the phenomenon of polarization.",

A key property of these maps is their orientation awareness. More\nspecifically, we demonstrate that unlike regular functional maps that link\nfunctional spaces of two manifolds, our complex functional maps establish a\nlink between oriented tangent bundles, thus permitting robust and efficient\ntransfer of tangent vector fields. By first endowing and then exploiting the\ntangent bundle of each shape with a complex structure, the resulting operations\nbecome naturally orientationaware, thus favoring orientation and angle\npreserving correspondence across shapes, without relying on descriptors or\nextra regularization. Finally, and perhaps more importantly, we demonstrate how\nthese objects enable several practical applications within the functional map\nframework.

In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing\npractical solutions and software pipelines for the design, training, testing,\nand experimental evaluation of DRL-based closed-loop control in the Open RAN.\nWe introduce ColO-RAN, the first publicly-available large-scale O-RAN testing\nframework with software-defined radios-in-the-loop. Building on the scale and\ncomputational capabilities of the Colosseum wireless network emulator, ColO-RAN\nenables ML research at scale using O-RAN components, programmable base\nstations, and a \"wireless data factory\". Specifically, we design and develop\nthree exemplary xApps for DRL-based control of RAN slicing, scheduling and\nonline model training, and evaluate their performance on a cellular network\nwith 7 softwarized base stations and 42 users. Finally, we showcase the\nportability of ColO-RAN to different platforms by deploying it on Arena, an\nindoor programmable testbed. Extensive results from our first-of-its-kind\nlarge-scale evaluation highlight the benefits and challenges of DRL-based\nadaptive control. They also provide insights on the development of wireless DRL\npipelines, from data analysis to the design of DRL agents, and on the tradeoffs\nassociated to training on a live RAN.

    "abstract": "Preserving the topology during a digitization process is a requirement of\nfirst importance. To this end, it is classical in Digital Geometry to assume\nthe shape borders to be par-regular. Par-regularity was proved to be equivalent\nto having positive reach or to belong to the class C 1,1 of curves with\nLipschitz derivative. Recently, we proposed to use a larger class that\nencompasses polygons with obtuse angles, the locally turn-bounded curves. The\naim of this technical report is to define the class of par-regular curves\ninside the class of locally turn-bounded curves using only the notion of turn,\nthat is of integral curvature. To be more precise, in a previous article, we\nhave already proved that par-regular curves are locally turn-bounded.\nIncidentally this proof lead us to show that the turn of par-regular curves is\na Lipschitz function of their length. We call the class of curves verifying\nthis latter property the curves with Lipschitz turn. In this technical report,\nwe prove the converse assertion : locally turn-bounded curves with Lipschitz\nturn are par-regular. The equivalence is stated in Theorem 3.1 and the converse\nassertion is proved in Lemma 3.2. In section 1, we recall the definition of\npar-regularity and equivalently of sets with positive reach. In section 2, we\npresent the notions of curves locally turn-bounded and of curves with Lipschitz\nturn.

With the\ngrowth of online text data, numerous summarization models have been proposed\nrecently. The Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) based neural summarization model\nis the most widely used in the summarization field due to its high performance.\nThis is because semantic information and structure information in the text is\nadequately considered when encoding. However, the existing extractive\nsummarization models pay little attention to and use the central topic\ninformation to assist the generation of summaries, which leads to models not\nensuring the generated summary under the primary topic. A lengthy document can\nspan several topics, and a single summary cannot do justice to all the topics.\nTherefore, the key to generating a high-quality summary is determining the\ncentral topic and building a summary based on it, especially for a long\ndocument. We propose a topic-aware encoding for document summarization to deal\nwith this issue. This model effectively combines syntactic-level and\ntopic-level information to build a comprehensive sentence representation.\nSpecifically, a neural topic model is added in the neural-based sentence-level\nrepresentation learning to adequately consider the central topic information\nfor capturing the critical content in the original document.

Most previous methods capture cross-modal interactions with a\ntransformer-based multimodal encoder, not fully addressing the misalignment\nbetween unimodal video and text features. Besides, learning fine-grained\nvisual-language alignment usually requires off-the-shelf object detectors to\nprovide object information, which is bottlenecked by the detector's limited\nvocabulary and expensive computation cost.\nWe propose Align and Prompt: an efficient and effective video-and-language\npre-training framework with better cross-modal alignment. First, we introduce a\nvideo-text contrastive (VTC) loss to align unimodal video-text features at the\ninstance level, which eases the modeling of cross-modal interactions. Then, we\npropose a new visually-grounded pre-training task, prompting entity modeling\n(PEM), which aims to learn fine-grained region-entity alignment. To achieve\nthis, we first introduce an entity prompter module, which is trained with VTC\nto produce the similarity between a video crop and text prompts instantiated\nwith entity names. The PEM task then asks the model to predict the entity\npseudo-labels (i.e~normalized similarity scores) for randomly-selected video\ncrops. The resulting pre-trained model achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nboth text-video retrieval and videoQA, outperforming prior work by a\nsubstantial margin.

In this work, we focus on image\nmodalities that are naturally aligned such that each pixel position represents\na similar relative position on the imaged object, as is common in medical\nimaging. We propose the pixel-wise aggregation of image-wise explanations as a\nsimple method to obtain label-wise and overall global explanations.

Previous sequence-to-sequence\nlanguage models trained with paired sentence-gloss data often fail to capture\nthe rich connections between the two distinct languages, leading to\nunsatisfactory transcriptions. We observe that despite different grammars,\nglosses effectively simplify sentences for the ease of deaf communication,\nwhile sharing a large portion of vocabulary with sentences. This has motivated\nus to implement glossification by executing a collection of editing actions,\ne.g. word addition, deletion, and copying, called editing programs, on their\nnatural spoken language counterparts. Specifically, we design a new neural\nagent that learns to synthesize and execute editing programs, conditioned on\nsentence contexts and partial editing results. The agent is trained to imitate\nminimal editing programs, while exploring more widely the program space via\npolicy gradients to optimize sequence-wise transcription quality.

We then demonstrated new covert channels by remotely\nobserving and modifying the system's global state via these protocol fields.\nUnlike earlier works, our research focuses on hosts that reside in firewalled\nnetworks (including source address validation -- SAV), which is a very common\nscenario nowadays. Our attacks are designed to be non-disruptive -- in the\nexfiltration scenario, this makes the attacks stealthier and thus extends their\nlongevity, and in case of host alias resolution and similar techniques -- this\nensures the techniques are ethical. We focused on ICMP, which is commonly\nserved by firewalls, and on UDP, which is forecasted to take a more prominent\nshare of the Internet traffic with the advent of HTTP/3 and QUIC, though we\nreport results for TCP as well.\nThe information leakage scenarios we discovered enable the construction of\npractical covert channels which directly pierce firewalls, or indirectly\nestablish communication via hosts in firewalled networks that also employ SAV.\nWe describe and test three novel attacks in this context: exfiltration via the\nfirewall itself, exfiltration via a DMZ host, and exfiltration via co-resident\ncontainers. These are three generic, new use cases for covert channels that\nwork around firewalling and enable devices that are not allowed direct\ncommunication with the Internet, to still exfiltrate data out of the network.\nIn other words, we exfiltrate data from isolated networks to the Internet.

However, real-world embodied learning, such as that\nperformed by humans and animals, is situated in a continual, non-episodic\nworld, whereas common benchmark tasks in RL are episodic, with the environment\nresetting between trials to provide the agent with multiple attempts. This\ndiscrepancy presents a major challenge when attempting to take RL algorithms\ndeveloped for episodic simulated environments and run them on real-world\nplatforms, such as robots. In this paper, we aim to address this discrepancy by\nlaying out a framework for Autonomous Reinforcement Learning (ARL):\nreinforcement learning where the agent not only learns through its own\nexperience, but also contends with lack of human supervision to reset between\ntrials. We introduce a simulated benchmark EARL around this framework,\ncontaining a set of diverse and challenging simulated tasks reflective of the\nhurdles introduced to learning when only a minimal reliance on extrinsic\nintervention can be assumed.

Current\nmethods of applying blue noise masks at each frame independently produce white\nnoise frequency spectra temporally. This white noise results in slower\nintegration convergence over time and unstable results when filtered\ntemporally. Unfortunately, achieving temporally stable blue noise distributions\nis non-trivial since 3D blue noise does not exhibit the desired 2D blue noise\nproperties, and alternative approaches degrade the spatial blue noise\nqualities.\nWe propose novel blue noise patterns that, when animated, produce values at a\npixel that are well distributed over time, converge rapidly for Monte Carlo\nintegration, and are more stable under TAA, while still retaining spatial blue\nnoise properties. To do so, we propose an extension to the well-known void and\ncluster algorithm that reformulates the underlying energy function to produce\nspatiotemporal blue noise masks.\nThese masks exhibit blue noise frequency spectra in both the spatial and\ntemporal domains, resulting in visually pleasing error patterns, rapid\nconvergence speeds, and increased stability when filtered temporally.

To seek effective oil spill\nsegmentation, we revisit the SAR imaging mechanism in order to attain the\nprobability distribution representation of oil spill SAR images, in which the\ncharacteristics of SAR images are properly modelled. We then exploit the\ndistribution representation to formulate the segmentation energy functional, by\nwhich oil spill characteristics are incorporated to guide oil spill\nsegmentation. Moreover, the oil spill segmentation model contains the oil spill\ncontour regularisation term and the updated level set regularisation term which\nenhance the representational power of the segmentation energy functional.\nBenefiting from the synchronisation of SAR image representation and oil spill\nsegmentation, our proposed method establishes an effective oil spill\nsegmentation framework. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our proposed segmentation framework for different types of marine oil spill\nSAR image segmentation.",

However, they require large labeled datasets for this, and\nobtaining them is a laborious task that requires clinical expertise.\nSemi/self-supervised learning-based approaches address this limitation by\nexploiting unlabeled data along with limited annotated data. Recent\nself-supervised learning methods use contrastive loss to learn good global\nlevel representations from unlabeled images and achieve high performance in\nclassification tasks on popular natural image datasets like ImageNet. In\npixel-level prediction tasks such as segmentation, it is crucial to also learn\ngood local level representations along with global representations to achieve\nbetter accuracy. However, the impact of the existing local contrastive\nloss-based methods remains limited for learning good local representations\nbecause similar and dissimilar local regions are defined based on random\naugmentations and spatial proximity; not based on the semantic label of local\nregions due to lack of large-scale expert annotations in the\nsemi/self-supervised setting. In this paper, we propose a local contrastive\nloss to learn good pixel level features useful for segmentation by exploiting\nsemantic label information obtained from pseudo-labels of unlabeled images\nalongside limited annotated images. In particular, we define the proposed loss\nto encourage similar representations for the pixels that have the same\npseudo-label/ label while being dissimilar to the representation of pixels with\ndifferent pseudo-label/label in the dataset. We perform pseudo-label based\nself-training and train the network by jointly optimizing the proposed\ncontrastive loss on both labeled and unlabeled sets and segmentation loss on\nonly the limited labeled set.

Nevertheless, it is challenging to characterize the mutual\ninformation accurately with small sample size or unknown distribution\nfunctions. In this article, we propose a privacy funnel based on mutual\ninformation neural estimator (MINE) to optimize the privacy utility trade-off\nby estimating mutual information. Instead of computing mutual information in\ntraditional way, we estimate it using an MINE, which obtains the estimated\nmutual information in a trained way, ensuring that the estimation results are\nas precise as possible. We employ estimated mutual information as a measure of\nprivacy and utility, and then form a problem to optimize data utility by\ntraining a neural network while the estimator's privacy discourse is less than\na threshold. The simulation results also demonstrated that the estimated mutual\ninformation from MINE works very well to approximate the mutual information\neven with a limited number of samples to quantify privacy leakage and data\nutility retention, as well as optimize the privacy utility trade-off.",

Previous adversarial attack works usually edit the whole\nquestion sentence, which has limited effect on testing the entity-based\nmulti-hop inference ability. In this paper, we propose a multi-hop reasoning\nchain based adversarial attack method. We formulate the multi-hop reasoning\nchains starting from the query entity to the answer entity in the constructed\ngraph, which allows us to align the question to each reasoning hop and thus\nattack any hop. We categorize the questions into different reasoning types and\nadversarially modify part of the question corresponding to the selected\nreasoning hop to generate the distracting sentence. We test our adversarial\nscheme on three QA models on HotpotQA dataset. The results demonstrate\nsignificant performance reduction on both answer and supporting facts\nprediction, verifying the effectiveness of our reasoning chain based attack\nmethod for multi-hop reasoning models and the vulnerability of them.

    "abstract": "Trustworthiness is typically regarded as a desirable feature of national\nidentification systems, but the variegated nature of the trustor communities\nassociated with such systems makes it difficult to see how a single system\ncould be equally trustworthy to all actual and potential trustors. This worry\nis accentuated by common theoretical accounts of trustworthiness. According to\nsuch accounts, trustworthiness is relativized to particular individuals and\nparticular areas of activity, such that one can be trustworthy with regard to\nsome individuals in respect of certain matters, but not trustworthy with regard\nto all trustors in respect of every matter. The present paper challenges this\nrelativistic approach to trustworthiness by outlining a new account of\ntrustworthiness, dubbed the expectation-oriented account. This account allows\nfor the possibility of an absolutist (or one-place) approach to\ntrustworthiness, and it is, we suggest, the one that best supports the effort\nto deliver trustworthy national identification systems. To be trustworthy, we\nsuggest, is to minimise the error associated with trustor expectations in\nsituations of social dependency (commonly referred to as trust situations). To\nbe trustworthy in an absolute sense is, we suggest, to assign equal value to\nall expectation-related errors in all trust situations. In addition to\noutlining the features of the expectation-oriented account, we describe some of\nthe implications of this account for the design, development, and management of\ntrustworthy national identification systems.",

    "title": "Neuromorphic Camera Denoising using Graph Neural Network-driven  Transformers",
    "abstract": "Neuromorphic vision is a bio-inspired technology that has triggered a\nparadigm shift in the computer-vision community and is serving as a key-enabler\nfor a multitude of applications. This technology has offered significant\nadvantages including reduced power consumption, reduced processing needs, and\ncommunication speed-ups. However, neuromorphic cameras suffer from significant\namounts of measurement noise. This noise deteriorates the performance of\nneuromorphic event-based perception and navigation algorithms. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel noise filtration algorithm to eliminate events which do not\nrepresent real log-intensity variations in the observed scene. We employ a\nGraph Neural Network (GNN)-driven transformer algorithm, called\nGNN-Transformer, to classify every active event pixel in the raw stream into\nreal-log intensity variation or noise. Within the GNN, a message-passing\nframework, called EventConv, is carried out to reflect the spatiotemporal\ncorrelation among the events, while preserving their asynchronous nature. We\nalso introduce the Known-object Ground-Truth Labeling (KoGTL) approach for\ngenerating approximate ground truth labels of event streams under various\nillumination conditions. KoGTL is used to generate labeled datasets, from\nexperiments recorded in challenging lighting conditions. These datasets are\nused to train and extensively test our proposed algorithm. When tested on\nunseen datasets, the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods by 12% in\nterms of filtration accuracy. Additional tests are also conducted on publicly\navailable datasets to demonstrate the generalization capabilities of the\nproposed algorithm in the presence of illumination variations and different\nmotion dynamics. Compared to existing solutions, qualitative results verified\nthe superior capability of the proposed algorithm to eliminate noise while\npreserving meaningful scene events.",

A common approach to this problem is to\nassign unlabeled data with pseudo-labels, which are then used as additional\nsupervision in training. Typically in recent work, the pseudo-labels are\nobtained by training a model on the labeled data, and then using confident\npredictions from the model to teach itself.

Accurate radiographic assessment\nof knee OA severity plays a critical role in chronic patient management.\nCurrent clinically-adopted knee OA grading systems are observer subjective and\nsuffer from inter-rater disagreements. In this work, we propose a\ncomputer-aided diagnosis approach to provide more accurate and consistent\nassessments of both composite and fine-grained OA grades simultaneously. A\nnovel semi-supervised learning method is presented to exploit the underlying\ncoherence in the composite and fine-grained OA grades by learning from\nunlabeled data. By representing the grade coherence using the log-probability\nof a pre-trained Gaussian Mixture Model, we formulate an incoherence loss to\nincorporate unlabeled data in training. The proposed method also describes a\nkeypoint-based pooling network, where deep image features are pooled from the\ndisease-targeted keypoints (extracted along the knee joint) to provide more\naligned and pathologically informative feature representations, for accurate OA\ngrade assessments. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on the\npublic Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) data, a multi-center ten-year\nobservational study on 4,796 subjects. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour method leads to significant improvements over previous strong whole\nimage-based deep classification network baselines (like ResNet-50).",

In order to generate entanglement for optical\ncommunication, the transmitter first prepares an entangled photon pair locally,\nand then transmits one of the photons to the receiver through an optical fiber\nor free space. Without feedback, the transmitter does not know whether the\nentangled photon has reached the receiver. The present work introduces a new\nmodel of unreliable entanglement assistance, whereby the communication system\noperates whether entanglement assistance is present or not. While the sender is\nignorant, the receiver knows whether the entanglement generation was\nsuccessful. In the case of a failure, the receiver decodes less information.

Quantum computing,\nas the most generic usage of quantum information, follows a hybrid architecture\nso far, namely, quantum algorithms are stored and controlled classically, and\nmainly the executions of them are quantum, leading to the so-called quantum\nprocessing units. Such a quantum-classical hybrid is constrained by its\nclassical ingredients, and cannot reveal the computational power of a fully\nquantum computer system as conceived from the beginning of the field. Recently,\nthe nature of quantum information has been further recognized, such as the\nno-programming and no-control theorems, and the unifying understandings of\nquantum algorithms and computing models. As a result, in this work we propose a\nmodel of universal quantum computer system, the quantum version of the von\nNeumann architecture. It uses ebits (i.e., Bell states) as elements of the\nquantum memory unit, and qubits as elements of the quantum control unit and\nprocessing unit. As a digital quantum system, its global configurations can be\nviewed as tensor-network states. Its universality is proved by the capability\nto execute quantum algorithms based on a program composition scheme via a\nuniversal quantum gate teleportation. It is also protected by the uncertainty\nprinciple, the fundamental law of quantum information, making it quantum-secure\ndistinct from the classical case. In particular, we introduce a few variants of\nquantum circuits, including the tailed, nested, and topological ones, to\ncharacterize the roles of quantum memory and control, which could also be of\nindependent interest in other contexts.

    "abstract": "Quantum candies (qandies) is a pedagogical simple model which describes many\nconcepts from quantum information processing (QIP) intuitively, without the\nneed to understand or make use of superpositions, and without the need of using\ncomplex algebra. One of the topics in quantum cryptography which gains research\nattention in recent years is quantum digital signatures (QDS), involving\nprotocols to securely sign classical bits using quantum methods. In this paper\nwe show how the \"qandy model\" can be used to describe three QDS protocols, in\norder to provide an important and potentially practical example of the power of\n\"superpositionless\" quantum information processing, for individuals without\nbackground knowledge in the field.",

    "abstract": "The objectives of this work are cross-modal text-audio and audio-text\nretrieval, in which the goal is to retrieve the audio content from a pool of\ncandidates that best matches a given written description and vice versa.\nText-audio retrieval enables users to search large databases through an\nintuitive interface: they simply issue free-form natural language descriptions\nof the sound they would like to hear. To study the tasks of text-audio and\naudio-text retrieval, which have received limited attention in the existing\nliterature, we introduce three challenging new benchmarks. We first construct\ntext-audio and audio-text retrieval benchmarks from the AudioCaps and Clotho\naudio captioning datasets. Additionally, we introduce the SoundDescs benchmark,\nwhich consists of paired audio and natural language descriptions for a diverse\ncollection of sounds that are complementary to those found in AudioCaps and\nClotho. We employ these three benchmarks to establish baselines for cross-modal\ntext-audio and audio-text retrieval, where we demonstrate the benefits of\npre-training on diverse audio tasks. We hope that our benchmarks will inspire\nfurther research into audio retrieval with free-form text queries. Code, audio\nfeatures for all datasets used, and the \\datasetName dataset will be made\npublicly available.",

The first\nchallenge is reducing the labelling effort (hence focusing on the data quality)\nwith the help of active learning, a feedback loop between the model inference\nand an oracle: as in insurance the unlabeled data is usually abundant, active\nlearning can become a significant asset in reducing the labelling cost. For\nthat purpose, this paper sketches out various classical active learning\nmethodologies before studying their empirical impact on both synthetic and real\ndatasets. Another key challenge in insurance is the fairness issue in model\ninferences. We will introduce and integrate a post-processing fairness for\nmulti-class tasks in this active learning framework to solve these two issues.\nFinally numerical experiments on unfair datasets highlight that the proposed\nsetup presents a good compromise between model precision and fairness.",

They constitute a powerful kernelized non-parametric method with\nwell-calibrated uncertainty estimates, however, off-the-shelf GP inference\nprocedures are limited to datasets with several thousand data points because of\ntheir cubic computational complexity. For this reason, many sparse GPs\ntechniques have been developed over the past years.

Thereby, the degree of correlation\nbetween the experts can vary between independent up to fully correlated\nexperts. The individual predictions of the experts are aggregated taking into\naccount their correlation resulting in consistent uncertainty estimates. Our\nmethod recovers independent Product of Experts, sparse GP and full GP in the\nlimiting cases. The presented framework can deal with a general kernel function\nand multiple variables, and has a time and space complexity which is linear in\nthe number of experts and data samples, which makes our approach highly\nscalable.

    "abstract": "Conventional video compression (VC) methods are based on motion compensated\ntransform coding, and the steps of motion estimation, mode and quantization\nparameter selection, and entropy coding are optimized individually due to the\ncombinatorial nature of the end-to-end optimization problem. Learned VC allows\nend-to-end rate-distortion (R-D) optimized training of nonlinear transform,\nmotion and entropy model simultaneously. Most works on learned VC consider\nend-to-end optimization of a sequential video codec based on R-D loss averaged\nover pairs of successive frames. It is well-known in conventional VC that\nhierarchical, bi-directional coding outperforms sequential compression because\nof its ability to use both past and future reference frames. This paper\nproposes a learned hierarchical bi-directional video codec (LHBDC) that\ncombines the benefits of hierarchical motion-compensated prediction and\nend-to-end optimization. Experimental results show that we achieve the best R-D\nresults that are reported for learned VC schemes to date in both PSNR and\nMS-SSIM. Compared to conventional video codecs, the R-D performance of our\nend-to-end optimized codec outperforms those of both x265 and SVT-HEVC encoders\n(\"veryslow\" preset) in PSNR and MS-SSIM as well as HM 16.23 reference software\nin MS-SSIM.

Even\nthough super-resolution microscopy methods have enabled visualization of\nsubcellular structures below the optical resolution limit, the spatial\nresolution is still far from enough for the structural reconstruction of\nbiomolecules in vivo (i.e. ~24 nm thickness of microtubule fiber). In this\nstudy, we proposed an A-net network and showed that the resolution of\ncytoskeleton images captured by a confocal microscope can be significantly\nimproved by combining the A-net deep learning network with the DWDC algorithm\nbased on degradation model. Utilizing the DWDC algorithm to construct new\ndatasets and taking advantage of A-net neural network's features (i.e.,\nconsiderably fewer layers), we successfully removed the noise and flocculent\nstructures, which originally interfere with the cellular structure in the raw\nimage, and improved the spatial resolution by 10 times using relatively small\ndataset.

    "abstract": "There are much recent interests in solving noncovnex min-max optimization\nproblems due to its broad applications in many areas including machine\nlearning, networked resource allocations, and distributed optimization.\nPerhaps, the most popular first-order method in solving min-max optimization is\nthe so-called simultaneous (or single-loop) gradient descent-ascent algorithm\ndue to its simplicity in implementation. However, theoretical guarantees on the\nconvergence of this algorithm is very sparse since it can diverge even in a\nsimple bilinear problem.\nIn this paper, our focus is to characterize the finite-time performance (or\nconvergence rates) of the continuous-time variant of simultaneous gradient\ndescent-ascent algorithm. In particular, we derive the rates of convergence of\nthis method under a number of different conditions on the underlying objective\nfunction, namely, two-sided Polyak-L ojasiewicz (PL), one-sided PL,\nnonconvex-strongly concave, and strongly convex-nonconcave conditions. Our\nconvergence results improve the ones in prior works under the same conditions\nof objective functions. The key idea in our analysis is to use the classic\nsingular perturbation theory and coupling Lyapunov functions to address the\ntime-scale difference and interactions between the gradient descent and ascent\ndynamics. Our results on the behavior of continuous-time algorithm may be used\nto enhance the convergence properties of its discrete-time counterpart.",

    "abstract": "Modern machine learning systems have been applied successfully to a variety\nof tasks in recent years but making such systems robust against adversarially\nchosen modifications of input instances seems to be a much harder problem. It\nis probably fair to say that no fully satisfying solution has been found up to\ndate and it is not clear if the standard formulation even allows for a\nprincipled solution. Hence, rather than following the classical path of bounded\nperturbations, we consider a model similar to the quantum PAC-learning model\nintroduced by Bshouty and Jackson [1995]. Our first key contribution shows that\nin this model we can reduce adversarial robustness to the conjunction of two\nclassical learning theory problems, namely (Problem 1) the problem of finding\ngenerative models and (Problem 2) the problem of devising classifiers that are\nrobust with respect to distributional shifts. Our second key contribution is\nthat the considered framework does not rely on specific (and hence also\nsomewhat arbitrary) threat models like $\\ell_p$ bounded perturbations. Instead,\nour reduction guarantees that in order to solve the adversarial robustness\nproblem in our model it suffices to consider a single distance notion, i.e. the\nHellinger distance. From the technical perspective our protocols are heavily\nbased on the recent advances on delegation of quantum computation, e.g. Mahadev\n[2018].\nAlthough the considered model is quantum and therefore not immediately\napplicable to ``real-world'' situations, one might hope that in the future\neither one can find a way to embed ``real-world'' problems into a quantum\nframework or that classical algorithms can be found that are capable of\nmimicking their powerful quantum counterparts.",

Yet, only few,\ntime-intensive automated image analysis pipelines have been validated for\nhigh-resolution (HiRes) settings. Efficient deep learning approaches, on the\nother hand, rarely support more than one fixed resolution (usually 1.0 mm).\nFurthermore, the lack of a standard submillimeter resolution as well as limited\navailability of diverse HiRes data with sufficient coverage of scanner, age,\ndiseases, or genetic variance poses additional, unsolved challenges for\ntraining HiRes networks. Incorporating resolution-independence into deep\nlearning-based segmentation, i.e., the ability to segment images at their\nnative resolution across a range of different voxel sizes, promises to overcome\nthese challenges, yet no such approach currently exists. We now fill this gap\nby introducing a Voxelsize Independent Neural Network (VINN) for\nresolution-independent segmentation tasks and present FastSurferVINN, which (i)\nestablishes and implements resolution-independence for deep learning as the\nfirst method simultaneously supporting 0.7-1.0 mm whole brain segmentation,\n(ii) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across resolutions, and\n(iii) mitigates the data imbalance problem present in HiRes datasets. Overall,\ninternal resolution-independence mutually benefits both HiRes and 1.0 mm MRI\nsegmentation. With our rigorously validated FastSurferVINN we distribute a\nrapid tool for morphometric neuroimage analysis.
