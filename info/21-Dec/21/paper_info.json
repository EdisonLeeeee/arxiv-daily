    "abstract": "We live in a data-centric world where we are heading to generate close to 200\nZettabytes of data by the year 2025. Our data processing requirements have also\nincreased as we push to build data processing frameworks that can process large\nvolumes of data in a short duration, a few milli- and even micro-seconds. In\nthe prevalent computer systems designs, data is stored passively in storage\ndevices which is brought in for processing and then the results are written\nout. As the volume of data explodes this constant data movement has led to a\n\"data movement wall\" which hinders further process and optimizations in data\nprocessing systems designs. One promising alternative to this architecture is\nto push computation to the data (instead of the other way around), and design a\ncomputational-storage device or CSD. The idea of CSD is not new and can trace\nits root to the pioneering work done in the 1970s and 1990s. More recently,\nwith the emergence of non-volatile memory (NVM) storage in the mainstream\ncomputing (e.g., NAND flash and Optane), the idea has again gained a lot of\ntraction with multiple academic and commercial prototypes being available now.\nIn this brief survey we present a systematic analysis of work done in the area\nof computation storage and present future directions.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential in digital pathology\napplications. The robustness of a diagnostic DL-based solution is essential for\nsafe clinical deployment. In this work we evaluate if adding uncertainty\nestimates for DL predictions in digital pathology could result in increased\nvalue for the clinical applications, by boosting the general predictive\nperformance or by detecting mispredictions. We compare the effectiveness of\nmodel-integrated methods (MC dropout and Deep ensembles) with a model-agnostic\napproach (Test time augmentation, TTA). Moreover, four uncertainty metrics are\ncompared. Our experiments focus on two domain shift scenarios: a shift to a\ndifferent medical center and to an underrepresented subtype of cancer. Our\nresults show that uncertainty estimates can add some reliability and reduce\nsensitivity to classification threshold selection. While advanced metrics and\ndeep ensembles perform best in our comparison, the added value over simpler\nmetrics and TTA is small. Importantly, the benefit of all evaluated uncertainty\nestimation methods is diminished by domain shift.",

    "abstract": "Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a sampling best-first method to search for\noptimal decisions. The MCTS's popularity is based on its extraordinary results\nin the challenging two-player based game Go, a game considered much harder than\nChess and that until very recently was considered infeasible for Artificial\nIntelligence methods. The success of MCTS depends heavily on how the tree is\nbuilt and the selection process plays a fundamental role in this. One\nparticular selection mechanism that has proved to be reliable is based on the\nUpper Confidence Bounds for Trees, commonly referred as UCT. The UCT attempts\nto nicely balance exploration and exploitation by considering the values stored\nin the statistical tree of the MCTS. However, some tuning of the MCTS UCT is\nnecessary for this to work well. In this work, we use Evolutionary Algorithms\n(EAs) to evolve mathematical expressions with the goal to substitute the UCT\nmathematical expression. We compare our proposed approach, called Evolution\nStrategy in MCTS (ES-MCTS) against five variants of the MCTS UCT, three\nvariants of the star-minimax family of algorithms as well as a random\ncontroller in the Game of Carcassonne. We also use a variant of our proposed\nEA-based controller, dubbed ES partially integrated in MCTS. We show how the\nES-MCTS controller, is able to outperform all these 10 intelligent controllers,\nincluding robust MCTS UCT controllers.",

The performance of a classification\nmodel is usually measured by Top-K Accuracy/Error (e.g., K=1 or 5). In this\npaper, we do not aim to propose new neural representation learning models as\nmost recent works do, but to show that it is easy to boost MCC performance with\na novel formulation through the lens of ranking. In particular, by viewing MCC\nas to rank classes for an instance, we first argue that ranking metrics, such\nas Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), can be more informative than\nexisting Top-K metrics. We further demonstrate that the dominant neural MCC\narchitecture can be formulated as a neural ranking framework with a specific\nset of design choices. Based on such generalization, we show that it is\nstraightforward and intuitive to leverage techniques from the rich information\nretrieval literature to improve the MCC performance out of the box.

First we derive, following the\ndiscrete de Rham (DDR) and Virtual Element (VEM) paradigms, pressure-robust\nmethods for the Stokes equations that support arbitrary orders and polyhedral\nmeshes. Unlike other methods presented in the literature, pressure-robustness\nis achieved here without resorting to an $\\boldsymbol{H}({\\rm div})$-conforming\nconstruction on a submesh, but rather projecting the volumetric force onto the\ndiscrete $\\boldsymbol{H}({\\bf curl})$ space. The cancellation of the pressure\nerror contribution stems from key commutation properties of the underlying DDR\nand VEM complexes. The pressure-robust error estimates in $h^{k+1}$ (with $h$\ndenoting the meshsize and $k\\ge 0$ the polynomial degree of the DDR or VEM\ncomplex) are proven theoretically and supported by a panel of three-dimensional\nnumerical tests. The second major contribution of the paper is an in-depth\nstudy of the relations between the DDR and VEM approaches. We show, in\nparticular, that a complex developed following one paradigm admits a\nreformulation in the other, and that couples of related DDR and VEM complexes\nsatisfy commuting diagram properties with the degrees of freedom maps.",

    "abstract": "We present a hierarchical framework aimed at decentralizing the distribution\nsystems market operations using localized peer-to-peer energy markets.\nHierarchically designed decision-making algorithm approaches the power systems\nmarket operations from a bottom-up perspective. The three layers of the\nhierarchical framework operate in orchestration to enable prosumers (the\ngrass-root actors) to maximize their revenues - hence, a prosumer-centric\nframework. The design of the framework incorporates existing smart grid\ntechnologies (Virtual Power Plants, Microgrids, Distributed Energy Resources)\nand redefine their functional objectives to align them with the\ndecentralization paradigm focused on empowering bottom-up grid operations\napproach. On one hand, the framework is enabling prosumers with simultaneous\naccess to the buy-sell choices that help them maximize their cost savings while\nensuring their consumption patterns and preferences are not being tradeoff as a\nresult of top-down operational decisions. On the other hand, it is designed to\noperate in harmony with the existing top-down grid operations mechanisms -\nthereby reducing the potential friction in its adaptation. This marriage of the\ntop-down and bottom-up operational approaches is facilitated through meticulous\norchestration of operational timescales. Framework's novel design also\nincorporates scalability and interoperability considerations, thereby tackling\nthe challenge of decentralization holistically.",

G2Miner uses pattern-aware, input-aware and\narchitecture-aware search strategies to achieve high efficiency on GPUs. To\nsimplify programming, it provides a code generator that automatically generates\npattern-aware CUDA code. G2Miner flexibly supports both breadth-first search\n(BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) to maximize memory utilization and generate\nsufficient parallelism for GPUs. For the scalability of G2Miner, we use a\ncustomized scheduling policy to balance work among multiple GPUs. Experiments\non a V100 GPU show that G2Miner achieves average speedups of 5.4x and 7.2x over\ntwo state-of-the-art single-GPU systems, Pangolin and PBE, respectively. In the\nmulti-GPU setting, G2Miner achieves linear speedups from 1 to 8 GPUs, for\nvarious patterns and data graphs.

    "abstract": "Cloud computing has become a major approach to enable reproducible\ncomputational experiments because of its support of on-demand hardware and\nsoftware resource provisioning.

The first is how to automate\nend-to-end execution of big data analytics in the cloud including virtual\ndistributed environment provisioning, network and security group setup, and big\ndata analytics pipeline description and execution. The second is an application\ndeveloped for one cloud, such as AWS or Azure, is difficult to reproduce in\nanother cloud, a.k.a. vendor lock-in problem. To tackle these problems, we\nleverage serverless computing and containerization techniques for automatic\nscalable big data application execution and reproducibility, and utilize the\nadapter design pattern to enable application portability and reproducibility\nacross different clouds. Based on the approach, we propose and develop an\nopen-source toolkit that supports 1) on-demand distributed hardware and\nsoftware environment provisioning, 2) automatic data and configuration storage\nfor each execution, 3) flexible client modes based on user preferences, 4)\nexecution history query, and 5) simple reproducibility of existing executions\nin the same environment or a different environment. We did extensive\nexperiments on both AWS and Azure using three big data analytics applications\nthat run on a virtual CPU/GPU cluster. Three main behaviors of our toolkit were\nbenchmarked: i) execution overhead ratio for reproducibility support, ii)\ndifferences of reproducing the same application on AWS and Azure in terms of\nexecution time, budgetary cost and cost-performance ratio, iii) differences\nbetween scale-out and scale-up approach for the same application on AWS and\nAzure.",

Existing communication\ntechnologies commonly implement responsive self-coordination mechanisms that\ncan be very slow in run-time situations. The sixth generation (6G) networks,\nbeing in their early stages of research and standardization activities, open\nnew opportunities to opt for a design-driven approach when developing\nself-coordination capabilities. This can be achieved through the use of hybrid\nweakly coupled SON designs. In this article, we review the history of SONs\nincluding the inherent self-coordination feature. We then delve into the\nconcept of hybrid SONs (H-SONs), and we summarize the challenges,\nopportunities, and future trends for H-SON development. We provide a\ncomprehensive collection of standardization activities and recommendations,\ndiscussing the key contributions and potential work to continue the evolution\nand push for a wide adoption of the H-SON paradigm. More importantly, we\npropose that H-SONs must be weakly coupled networks, i.e., the various feedback\nloops must be almost isolated from each other to improve the stability and to\navoid chaotic situations.

In this work, we study how ROI programmability can\nbe leveraged for tracking applications by anticipating where the ROI will be\nlocated in future frames and switching pixels off outside of this region. We\nrefer to this process of ROI prediction and corresponding sensor configuration\nas adaptive subsampling. Our adaptive subsampling algorithms comprise an object\ndetector and an ROI predictor (Kalman filter) which operate in conjunction to\noptimize the energy efficiency of the vision pipeline with the end task being\nobject tracking. To further facilitate the implementation of our adaptive\nalgorithms in real life, we select a candidate algorithm and map it onto an\nFPGA. Leveraging Xilinx Vitis AI tools, we designed and accelerated a YOLO\nobject detector-based adaptive subsampling algorithm. In order to further\nimprove the algorithm post-deployment, we evaluated several competing baselines\non the OTB100 and LaSOT datasets. We found that coupling the ECO tracker with\nthe Kalman filter has a competitive AUC score of 0.4568 and 0.3471 on the\nOTB100 and LaSOT datasets respectively. Further, the power efficiency of this\nalgorithm is on par with, and in a couple of instances superior to, the other\nbaselines. The ECO-based algorithm incurs a power consumption of approximately\n4 W averaged across both datasets while the YOLO-based approach requires power\nconsumption of approximately 6 W (as per our power consumption model).

While both methods rely on a HHO formulation of the viscous\nterm, the pressure-velocity coupling is fundamentally different, up to the\npoint that the two approaches can be considered antithetical. The first method\nis kinetic energy preserving, meaning that the skew-symmetric discretization of\nthe convective term is guaranteed not to alter the kinetic energy balance. The\napproximated velocity fields exactly satisfy the divergence free constraint and\ncontinuity of the normal component of the velocity is weakly enforced on the\nmesh skeleton, leading to H-div conformity. The second scheme relies on Godunov\nfluxes for pressure-velocity coupling: a Harten, Lax and van Leer (HLL)\napproximated Riemann Solver designed for cell centered formulations is adapted\nto hybrid face centered formulations. The resulting numerical scheme is robust\nup to the inviscid limit, meaning that it can be applied for seeking\napproximate solutions of the incompressible Euler equations. The schemes are\nnumerically validated performing steady and unsteady two dimensional test cases\nand evaluating the convergence rates on h-refined mesh sequences.

While many research works are being\nundertaken to enhance Deep Neural Networks (DNN) -- the centerpiece of DL\napplications -- practical deployment challenges of these applications in the\nCloud and Edge systems, and their impact on the usability of the applications\nhave not been sufficiently investigated. In particular, the impact of deploying\ndifferent virtualization platforms, offered by the Cloud and Edge, on the\nusability of DL applications (in terms of the End-to-End (E2E) inference time)\nhas remained an open question. Importantly, resource elasticity (by means of\nscale-up), CPU pinning, and processor type (CPU vs GPU) configurations have\nshown to be influential on the virtualization overhead. Accordingly, the goal\nof this research is to study the impact of these potentially decisive\ndeployment options on the E2E performance, thus, usability of the DL\napplications. To that end, we measure the impact of four popular execution\nplatforms (namely, bare-metal, virtual machine (VM), container, and container\nin VM) on the E2E inference time of four types of DL applications, upon\nchanging processor configuration (scale-up, CPU pinning) and processor types.\nThis study reveals a set of interesting and sometimes counter-intuitive\nfindings that can be used as best practices by Cloud solution architects to\nefficiently deploy DL applications in various systems.

    "abstract": "Face recognition networks generally demonstrate bias with respect to\nsensitive attributes like gender, skintone etc. For gender and skintone, we\nobserve that the regions of the face that a network attends to vary by the\ncategory of an attribute. This might contribute to bias. Building on this\nintuition, we propose a novel distillation-based approach called Distill and\nDe-bias (D&D) to enforce a network to attend to similar face regions,\nirrespective of the attribute category. In D&D, we train a teacher network on\nimages from one category of an attribute; e.g. light skintone. Then distilling\ninformation from the teacher, we train a student network on images of the\nremaining category; e.g., dark skintone. A feature-level distillation loss\nconstrains the student network to generate teacher-like representations. This\nallows the student network to attend to similar face regions for all attribute\ncategories and enables it to reduce bias. We also propose a second distillation\nstep on top of D&D, called D&D++. For the D&D++ network, we distill the\n`un-biasedness' of the D&D network into a new student network, the D&D++\nnetwork. We train the new network on all attribute categories; e.g., both light\nand dark skintones. This helps us train a network that is less biased for an\nattribute, while obtaining higher face verification performance than D&D. We\nshow that D&D++ outperforms existing baselines in reducing gender and skintone\nbias on the IJB-C dataset, while obtaining higher face verification performance\nthan existing adversarial de-biasing methods.

Specifically, the inconsistency in the\nhuman labeling of the incidents significantly affects the performance of\nsupervised learning models. To that end, we focus on a data-centric approach to\nimprove the accuracy and reduce the false alarm rate of traffic incident\ndetection on highways. We develop a weak supervised learning workflow to\ngenerate high-quality training labels for the incident data without the ground\ntruth labels, and we use those generated labels in the supervised learning\nsetup for final detection. This approach comprises three stages. First, we\nintroduce a data preprocessing and curation pipeline that processes traffic\nsensor data to generate high-quality training data through leveraging labeling\nfunctions, which can be domain knowledge-related or simple heuristic rules.\nSecond, we evaluate the training data generated by weak supervision using three\nsupervised learning models -- random forest, k-nearest neighbors, and a support\nvector machine ensemble -- and long short-term memory classifiers. The results\nshow that the accuracy of all of the models improves significantly after using\nthe training data generated by weak supervision. Third, we develop an online\nreal-time incident detection approach that leverages the model ensemble and the\nuncertainty quantification while detecting incidents.

    "abstract": "Domain generalization (DG) methods aim to develop models that generalize to\nsettings where the test distribution is different from the training data. In\nthis paper, we focus on the challenging problem of multi-source zero-shot DG,\nwhere labeled training data from multiple source domains is available but with\nno access to data from the target domain. Though this problem has become an\nimportant topic of research, surprisingly, the simple solution of pooling all\nsource data together and training a single classifier is highly competitive on\nstandard benchmarks. More importantly, even sophisticated approaches that\nexplicitly optimize for invariance across different domains do not necessarily\nprovide non-trivial gains over ERM. In this paper, for the first time, we study\nthe important link between pre-specified domain labels and the generalization\nperformance. Using a motivating case-study and a new variant of a\ndistributional robust optimization algorithm, GroupDRO++, we first demonstrate\nhow inferring custom domain groups can lead to consistent improvements over the\noriginal domain labels that come with the dataset. Subsequently, we introduce a\ngeneral approach for multi-domain generalization, MulDEns, that uses an\nERM-based deep ensembling backbone and performs implicit domain re-labeling\nthrough a meta-optimization algorithm. Using empirical studies on multiple\nstandard benchmarks, we show that MulDEns does not require tailoring the\naugmentation strategy or the training process specific to a dataset,\nconsistently outperforms ERM by significant margins, and produces\nstate-of-the-art generalization performance, even when compared to existing\nmethods that exploit the domain labels.",

By developing wave energy converters as the\nmain converter technology in this process, their power take-off (PTO) systems\nhave been investigated. Adjusting PTO parameters is a challenging optimization\nproblem because there is a complex and nonlinear relationship between these\nparameters and the absorbed power output. In this regard, this study aims to\noptimize the PTO system parameters of a point absorber wave energy converter in\nthe wave scenario in Perth, on Western Australian coasts. The converter is\nnumerically designed to oscillate against irregular and multi-dimensional waves\nand sensitivity analysis for PTO settings is performed. Then, to find the\noptimal PTO system parameters which lead to the highest power output, ten\noptimization algorithms are incorporated to solve the non-linear problem,\nIncluding Nelder-Mead search method, Active-set method, Sequential quadratic\nProgramming method (SQP), Multi-Verse Optimizer (MVO), and six modified\ncombination of Genetic, Surrogate and fminsearch algorithms. After a\nfeasibility landscape analysis, the optimization outcome is carried out and\ngives us the best answer in terms of PTO system settings.

    "abstract": "Machine learning researchers have long noted a trade-off between\ninterpretability and prediction performance. On the one hand, traditional\nmodels are often interpretable to humans but they cannot achieve high\nprediction performances. At the opposite end of the spectrum, deep models can\nachieve state-of-the-art performances in many tasks. However, deep models'\npredictions are known to be uninterpretable to humans. In this paper we present\na framework that shortens the gap between the two aforementioned groups of\nmethods. Given an artificial neural network (ANN), our method finds a Gaussian\nprocess (GP) whose predictions almost match those of the ANN. As GPs are highly\ninterpretable, we use the trained GP to explain the ANN's decisions. We use our\nmethod to explain ANNs' decisions on may datasets. The explanations provide\nintriguing insights about the ANNs' decisions. With the best of our knowledge,\nour inference formulation for GPs is the first one in which an ANN and a\nsimilarly behaving Gaussian process naturally appear. Furthermore, we examine\nsome of the known theoretical conditions under which an ANN is interpretable by\nGPs. Some of those theoretical conditions are too restrictive for modern\narchitectures. However, we hypothesize that only a subset of those theoretical\nconditions are sufficient. Finally, we implement our framework as a publicly\navailable tool called GPEX. Given any pytorch feed-forward module, GPEX allows\nusers to interpret any ANN subcomponent of the module effortlessly and without\nhaving to be involved in the inference algorithm.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables distribution of machine learning workloads\nfrom the cloud to resource-limited edge devices. Unfortunately, current deep\nnetworks remain not only too compute-heavy for inference and training on edge\ndevices, but also too large for communicating updates over\nbandwidth-constrained networks. In this paper, we develop, implement, and\nexperimentally validate a novel FL framework termed Federated Dynamic Sparse\nTraining (FedDST) by which complex neural networks can be deployed and trained\nwith substantially improved efficiency in both on-device computation and\nin-network communication. At the core of FedDST is a dynamic process that\nextracts and trains sparse sub-networks from the target full network. With this\nscheme, \"two birds are killed with one stone:\" instead of full models, each\nclient performs efficient training of its own sparse networks, and only sparse\nnetworks are transmitted between devices and the cloud. Furthermore, our\nresults reveal that the dynamic sparsity during FL training more flexibly\naccommodates local heterogeneity in FL agents than the fixed, shared sparse\nmasks. Moreover, dynamic sparsity naturally introduces an \"in-time\nself-ensembling effect\" into the training dynamics and improves the FL\nperformance even over dense training. In a realistic and challenging non i.i.d.\nFL setting, FedDST consistently outperforms competing algorithms in our\nexperiments: for instance, at any fixed upload data cap on non-iid CIFAR-10, it\ngains an impressive accuracy advantage of 10% over FedAvgM when given the same\nupload data cap; the accuracy gap remains 3% even when FedAvgM is given 2x the\nupload data cap, further demonstrating efficacy of FedDST.

But, due to the complexity of the problem, literature in this area\nfocuses on a limited subset of ingredients or dish types and simple\nconvolutional neural networks or traditional machine learning. Simultaneously,\nestimation of ingredient portions can help improve calorie estimation and meal\nre-production from a given image. In this paper, given a single cooking image,\na pipeline for calorie estimation and meal re-production for different servings\nof the meal is proposed. The pipeline contains two stages. In the first stage,\na set of ingredients associated with the meal in the given image are predicted.\nIn the second stage, given image features and ingredients, portions of the\ningredients and finally the total meal calorie are simultaneously estimated\nusing a deep transformer-based model. Portion estimation introduced in the\nmodel helps improve calorie estimation and is also beneficial for meal\nre-production in different serving sizes. To demonstrate the benefits of the\npipeline, the model can be used for meal kits generation. To evaluate the\npipeline, the large scale dataset Recipe1M is used. Prior to experiments, the\nRecipe1M dataset is parsed and explicitly annotated with portions of\ningredients. Experiments show that using ingredients and their portions\nsignificantly improves calorie estimation. Also, a visual interface is created\nin which a user can interact with the pipeline to reach accurate calorie\nestimations and generate a meal kit for cooking purposes.",

We achieve this by training a deep neural network to globally map data\nfrom the constitutive manifold onto a lower-dimensional Euclidean vector space.\nAs such, we establish the relation between the norm of the mapped Euclidean\nvector space and the metric of the manifold and lead to a more physically\nconsistent notion of distance for the material data. This treatment in return\nallows us to bypass the expensive combinatorial optimization, which may\nsignificantly speed up the model-free simulations when data are abundant and of\nhigh dimensions. Meanwhile, the learning of embedding also improves the\nrobustness of the algorithm when the data is sparse or distributed unevenly in\nthe parametric space.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous techniques in mobile and\nembedded systems for applications such as image/object recognition and\nclassification. The trend of executing multiple DNNs simultaneously exacerbate\nthe existing limitations of meeting stringent latency/accuracy requirements on\nresource constrained mobile devices. The prior art sheds light on exploring the\naccuracy-resource tradeoff by scaling the model sizes in accordance to resource\ndynamics. However, such model scaling approaches face to imminent challenges:\n(i) large space exploration of model sizes, and (ii) prohibitively long\ntraining time for different model combinations. In this paper, we present\nLegoDNN, a lightweight, block-grained scaling solution for running multi-DNN\nworkloads in mobile vision systems. LegoDNN guarantees short model training\ntimes by only extracting and training a small number of common blocks (e.g. 5\nin VGG and 8 in ResNet) in a DNN. At run-time, LegoDNN optimally combines the\ndescendant models of these blocks to maximize accuracy under specific resources\nand latency constraints, while reducing switching overhead via smart\nblock-level scaling of the DNN. We implement LegoDNN in TensorFlow Lite and\nextensively evaluate it against state-of-the-art techniques (FLOP scaling,\nknowledge distillation and model compression) using a set of 12 popular DNN\nmodels. Evaluation results show that LegoDNN provides 1,296x to 279,936x more\noptions in model sizes without increasing training time, thus achieving as much\nas 31.74% improvement in inference accuracy and 71.07% reduction in scaling\nenergy consumptions.",

Conversely, in theory, there is not necessarily\nsuch a functional regularizer whose first-order information matches the\nreplaced network module, which means the network output may not be covered by\nthe original regularization model. Moreover, up to now, there is also no theory\nto guarantee the global convergence and robustness (regularity) of unrolled\nnetworks under realistic assumptions. To bridge this gap, this paper propose to\npresent a safeguarded methodology on network unrolling. Specifically, focusing\non accelerated MRI, we unroll a zeroth-order algorithm, of which the network\nmodule represents the regularizer itself, so that the network output can be\nstill covered by the regularization model. Furthermore, inspired by the ideal\nof deep equilibrium models, before backpropagating, we carry out the unrolled\niterative network to converge to a fixed point to ensure the convergence. In\ncase the measurement data contains noise, we prove that the proposed network is\nrobust against noisy interference.

    "title": "Does Explainable Machine Learning Uncover the Black Box in Vision  Applications?",
    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) in general and deep learning (DL) in particular has\nbecome an extremely popular tool in several vision applications (like object\ndetection, super resolution, segmentation, object tracking etc.). Almost in\nparallel, the issue of explainability in ML (i.e. the ability to\nexplain/elaborate the way a trained ML model arrived at its decision) in vision\nhas also received fairly significant attention from various quarters. However,\nwe argue that the current philosophy behind explainable ML suffers from certain\nlimitations, and the resulting explanations may not meaningfully uncover black\nbox ML models. To elaborate our assertion, we first raise a few fundamental\nquestions which have not been adequately discussed in the corresponding\nliterature. We also provide perspectives on how explainablity in ML can benefit\nby relying on more rigorous principles in the related areas.",

    "abstract": "Subgraph recognition aims at discovering a compressed substructure of a graph\nthat is most informative to the graph property. It can be formulated by\noptimizing Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) with a mutual information\nestimator. However, GIB suffers from training instability since the mutual\ninformation of graph data is intrinsically difficult to estimate. This paper\nintroduces a noise injection method to compress the information in the\nsubgraphs, which leads to a novel Variational Graph Information Bottleneck\n(VGIB) framework. VGIB allows a tractable variational approximation to its\nobjective under mild assumptions. Therefore, VGIB enjoys more stable and\nefficient training process - we find that VGIB converges 10 times faster than\nGIB with improved performances in practice. Extensive experiments on graph\ninterpretation, explainability of Graph Neural Networks, and graph\nclassification show that VGIB finds better subgraphs than existing methods.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel framework for instance segmentation of 3D buildings from\nMulti-view Stereo (MVS) urban scenes. Unlike existing works focusing on\nsemantic segmentation of an urban scene, the emphasis of this work lies in\ndetecting and segmenting 3D building instances even if they are attached and\nembedded in a large and imprecise 3D surface model. Multi-view RGB images are\nfirst enhanced to RGBH images by adding a heightmap and are segmented to obtain\nall roof instances using a fine-tuned 2D instance segmentation neural network.\nRoof instance masks from different multi-view images are then clustered into\nglobal masks. Our mask clustering accounts for spatial occlusion and\noverlapping, which can eliminate segmentation ambiguities among multi-view\nimages. Based on these global masks, 3D roof instances are segmented out by\nmask back-projections and extended to the entire building instances through a\nMarkov random field (MRF) optimization. Quantitative evaluations and ablation\nstudies have shown the effectiveness of all major steps of the method. A\ndataset for the evaluation of instance segmentation of 3D building models is\nprovided as well. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first dataset for 3D\nurban buildings on the instance segmentation level.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to address the problem of anomaly discovery in semantic\nsegmentation. Our key observation is that semantic classification plays a\ncritical role in existing approaches, while the incorrectly classified pixels\nare easily regarded as anomalies. Such a phenomenon frequently appears and is\nrarely discussed, which significantly reduces the performance of anomaly\ndiscovery. To this end, we propose a novel Distillation Comparison Network\n(DiCNet). It comprises of a teacher branch which is a semantic segmentation\nnetwork that removed the semantic classification head, and a student branch\nthat is distilled from the teacher branch through a distribution distillation.\nWe show that the distillation guarantees the semantic features of the two\nbranches hold consistency in the known classes, while reflect inconsistency in\nthe unknown class. Therefore, we leverage the semantic feature discrepancy\nbetween the two branches to discover the anomalies. DiCNet abandons the\nsemantic classification head in the inference process, and hence significantly\nalleviates the issue caused by incorrect semantic classification. Extensive\nexperimental results on StreetHazards dataset and BDD-Anomaly dataset are\nconducted to verify the superior performance of DiCNet. In particular, DiCNet\nobtains a 6.3% improvement in AUPR and a 5.2% improvement in FPR95 on\nStreetHazards dataset, achieves a 4.2% improvement in AUPR and a 6.8%\nimprovement in FPR95 on BDD-Anomaly dataset.

    "abstract": "Real-time registration of partially overlapping point clouds has emerging\napplications in cooperative perception for autonomous vehicles and multi-agent\nSLAM. The relative translation between point clouds in these applications is\nhigher than in traditional SLAM and odometry applications, which challenges the\nidentification of correspondences and a successful registration. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel registration method for partially overlapping point clouds\nwhere correspondences are learned using an efficient point-wise feature\nencoder, and refined using a graph-based attention network. This attention\nnetwork exploits geometrical relationships between key points to improve the\nmatching in point clouds with low overlap. At inference time, the relative pose\ntransformation is obtained by robustly fitting the correspondences through\nsample consensus. The evaluation is performed on the KITTI dataset and a novel\nsynthetic dataset including low-overlapping point clouds with displacements of\nup to 30m. The proposed method achieves on-par performance with\nstate-of-the-art methods on the KITTI dataset, and outperforms existing methods\nfor low overlapping point clouds. Additionally, the proposed method achieves\nsignificantly faster inference times, as low as 410ms, between 5 and 35 times\nfaster than competing methods.

    "abstract": "We explain how to use Kolmogorov's Superposition Theorem (KST) to overcome\nthe curse of dimensionality in approximating multi-dimensional functions and\nlearning multi-dimensional data sets by using neural networks of two layers.\nThat is, there is a class of functions called $K$-Lipschitz continuous in the\nsense that the K-outer function $g$ of $f$ is Lipschitz continuous can be\napproximated by a ReLU network of two layers with $dn, n$ widths to have an\napproximation order $O(d^2/n)$. In addition, we show that polynomials of high\ndegree can be expressed by using neural networks with activation function\n$\\sigma_\\ell(t)=(t_+)^\\ell$ with $\\ell\\ge 2$ with multiple layers and\nappropriate widths. More layers of neural networks, the higher degree\npolynomials can be reproduced. Hence, the deep learning algorithm can well\napproximate multi-dimensional data when the number of layers increases with\nhigh degree activation function $\\sigma_\\ell$. Finally, we present a\nmathematical justification for image classification by using a deep learning\nalgorithm.",

    "abstract": "Amongst a variety of approaches aimed at making the learning procedure of\nneural networks more effective, the scientific community developed strategies\nto order the examples according to their estimated complexity, to distil\nknowledge from larger networks, or to exploit the principles behind adversarial\nmachine learning. A different idea has been recently proposed, named Friendly\nTraining, which consists in altering the input data by adding an automatically\nestimated perturbation, with the goal of facilitating the learning process of a\nneural classifier. The transformation progressively fades-out as long as\ntraining proceeds, until it completely vanishes. In this work we revisit and\nextend this idea, introducing a radically different and novel approach inspired\nby the effectiveness of neural generators in the context of Adversarial Machine\nLearning. We propose an auxiliary multi-layer network that is responsible of\naltering the input data to make them easier to be handled by the classifier at\nthe current stage of the training procedure. The auxiliary network is trained\njointly with the neural classifier, thus intrinsically increasing the 'depth'\nof the classifier, and it is expected to spot general regularities in the data\nalteration process. The effect of the auxiliary network is progressively\nreduced up to the end of training, when it is fully dropped and the classifier\nis deployed for applications. We refer to this approach as Neural Friendly\nTraining. An extended experimental procedure involving several datasets and\ndifferent neural architectures shows that Neural Friendly Training overcomes\nthe originally proposed Friendly Training technique, improving the\ngeneralization of the classifier, especially in the case of noisy data.",

One of the most basic versions of this problem was settled more\nthan 50 years ago by Levenshtein, or one substitution, with nearly optimal\nredundancy. However, this approach fails to extend to many simple and natural\nvariations of the binary single-edit error setting. In this work, we make\nprogress on the code design problem above in three such variations:\nWe construct linear-time encodable and decodable length-$n$ non-binary codes\ncorrecting a single edit error with nearly optimal redundancy $\\log\nn+O(\\log\\log n)$, providing an alternative simpler proof of a result by Cai,\nChee, Gabrys, Kiah, and Nguyen (IEEE Trans.

The latency, cost, and other challenges\nin cloud-based IoT data processing have driven the adoption of Edge and Fog\ncomputing models, where some data processing tasks are moved closer to data\nsources. Properly dealing with the flow of such data requires building data\npipelines, to control the complete life cycle of data streams from data\nacquisition at the data source, edge and fog processing, to Cloud side storage\nand analytics. Data analytics tasks need to be executed dynamically at\ndifferent distances from the data sources and often on very heterogeneous\nhardware devices. This can be streamlined by the use of a Serverless (or FaaS)\ncloud computing model, where tasks are defined as virtual functions, which can\nbe migrated from edge to cloud (and vice versa) and executed in an event-driven\nmanner on data streams. In this work, we investigate the benefits of building\nServerless data pipelines (SDP) for IoT data analytics and evaluate three\ndifferent approaches for designing SDPs: 1) Off-the-shelf data flow tool (DFT)\nbased, 2) Object storage service (OSS) based and 3) MQTT based.

    "abstract": "Recently, several approaches have explored the detection and classification\nof objects in videos to perform Zero-Shot Action Recognition with remarkable\nresults. In these methods, class-object relationships are used to associate\nvisual patterns with the semantic side information because these relationships\nalso tend to appear in texts. Therefore, word vector methods would reflect them\nin their latent representations. Inspired by these methods and by video\ncaptioning's ability to describe events not only with a set of objects but with\ncontextual information, we propose a method in which video captioning models,\ncalled observers, provide different and complementary descriptive sentences. We\ndemonstrate that representing videos with descriptive sentences instead of deep\nfeatures, in ZSAR, is viable and naturally alleviates the domain adaptation\nproblem, as we reached state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the UCF101\ndataset and competitive performance on HMDB51 without their training sets. We\nalso demonstrate that word vectors are unsuitable for building the semantic\nembedding space of our descriptions. Thus, we propose to represent the classes\nwith sentences extracted from documents acquired with search engines on the\nInternet, without any human evaluation on the quality of descriptions. Lastly,\nwe build a shared semantic space employing BERT-based embedders pre-trained in\nthe paraphrasing task on multiple text datasets. We show that this pre-training\nis essential for bridging the semantic gap. The projection onto this space is\nstraightforward for both types of information, visual and semantic, because\nthey are sentences, enabling the classification with nearest neighbour rule in\nthis shared space.

    "abstract": "A key-value cache is a key component of many services to provide low-latency\nand high-throughput data accesses to a huge amount of data. To improve the\nend-to-end performance of such services, a key-value cache must achieve a high\ncache hit ratio with high throughput. In this paper, we propose a new cache\nreplacement algorithm, multi-step LRU, which achieves high throughput by\nefficiently exploiting SIMD instructions without using per-item additional\nmemory (LRU metadata) to record information such as the last access timestamp.\nFor a small set of items that can fit within a vector register, SIMD-based LRU\nmanagement without LRU metadata is known (in-vector LRU). It remembers the\naccess history by reordering items in one vector using vector shuffle\ninstruction. In-vector LRU alone cannot be used for a caching system since it\ncan manage only few items. Set-associative cache is a straightforward way to\nbuild a large cache using in-vector LRU as a building block. However, a naive\nset-associative cache based on in-vector LRU has a poorer cache hit ratio than\nthe original LRU although it can achieve a high throughput. Our multi-step LRU\nenhances naive set-associative cache based on in-vector LRU for improving cache\naccuracy by taking both access frequency and access recency of items into\naccount while keeping the efficiency by SIMD instructions. Our results indicate\nthat multi-step LRU outperforms the original LRU and GCLOCK algorithms in terms\nof both execution speed and cache hit ratio. Multi-step LRU improves the cache\nhit ratios over the original LRU by implicitly taking access frequency of items\nas well as access recency into account. The cache hit ratios of multi-step LRU\nare similar to those of ARC, which achieves a higher a cache hit ratio in a\ntradeoff for using more LRU metadata.",

    "abstract": "In several machine learning tasks for graph structured data, the graphs under\nconsideration may be composed of a varying number of nodes. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to design pooling methods that aggregate the graph representations of\nvarying size to representations of fixed size which can be used in downstream\ntasks, such as graph classification. Existing graph pooling methods offer no\nguarantee with regards to the similarity of a graph representation and its\npooled version. In this work we address this limitation by proposing FlowPool,\na pooling method that optimally preserves the statistics of a graph\nrepresentation to its pooled counterpart by minimizing their Wasserstein\ndistance. This is achieved by performing a Wasserstein gradient flow with\nrespect to the pooled graph representation. We propose a versatile\nimplementation of our method which can take into account the geometry of the\nrepresentation space through any ground cost. This implementation relies on the\ncomputation of the gradient of the Wasserstein distance with recently proposed\nimplicit differentiation schemes. Our pooling method is amenable to automatic\ndifferentiation and can be integrated in end-to-end deep learning\narchitectures. Further, FlowPool is invariant to permutations and can therefore\nbe combined with permutation equivariant feature extraction layers in GNNs in\norder to obtain predictions that are independent of the ordering of the nodes.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method leads to an increase in\nperformance compared to existing pooling methods when evaluated in graph\nclassification tasks.",

After training on an\nextended version of the PhraseCut dataset, our system generates a binary\nsegmentation map for an image based on a free-text prompt or on an additional\nimage expressing the query. Different variants of the latter image-based\nprompts are analyzed in detail. This novel hybrid input allows for dynamic\nadaptation not only to the three segmentation tasks mentioned above, but to any\nbinary segmentation task where a text or image query can be formulated.\nFinally, we find our system to adapt well to generalized queries involving\naffordances or properties.

    "title": "Low-resource Learning with Knowledge Graphs: A Comprehensive Survey",
    "abstract": "Machine learning methods especially deep neural networks have achieved great\nsuccess but many of them often rely on a number of labeled samples for\ntraining. In real-world applications, we often need to address sample shortage\ndue to e.g., dynamic contexts with emerging prediction targets and costly\nsample annotation. Therefore, low-resource learning, which aims to learn robust\nprediction models with no enough resources (especially training samples), is\nnow being widely investigated. Among all the low-resource learning studies,\nmany prefer to utilize some auxiliary information in form of Knowledge Graph\n(KG), which is becoming more and more popular for knowledge representation, to\nreduce the reliance on labeled samples. In this survey, we very comprehensively\nreviewed over $90$ papers about KG-aware research for two major low-resource\nlearning settings -- zero-shot learning (ZSL) where new classes for prediction\nhave never appeared in training, and few-shot learning (FSL) where new classes\nfor prediction have only a small number of labeled samples that are available.\nWe first introduced the KGs used in ZSL and FSL studies as well as the existing\nand potential KG construction solutions, and then systematically categorized\nand summarized KG-aware ZSL and FSL methods, dividing them into different\nparadigms such as the mapping-based, the data augmentation, the\npropagation-based and the optimization-based. We next presented different\napplications, including both KG augmented prediction tasks in Computer Vision\nand Natural Language Processing but also tasks for KG completion, and some\ntypical evaluation resources for each task. We eventually discussed some\nchallenges and future directions on aspects such as new learning and reasoning\nparadigms, and the construction of high quality KGs.",

    "abstract": "To effectively use an abstract (PDDL) planning domain to achieve goals in an\nunknown environment, an agent must instantiate such a domain with the objects\nof the environment and their properties. If the agent has an egocentric and\npartial view of the environment, it needs to act, sense, and abstract the\nperceived data in the planning domain. Furthermore, the agent needs to compile\nthe plans computed by a symbolic planner into low level actions executable by\nits actuators. This paper proposes a framework that aims to accomplish the\naforementioned perspective and allows an agent to perform different tasks. For\nthis purpose, we integrate machine learning models to abstract the sensory\ndata, symbolic planning for goal achievement and path planning for navigation.\nWe evaluate the proposed method in accurate simulated environments, where the\nsensors are RGB-D on-board camera, GPS and compass.",

Although several efforts\nhave attempted to support CUDA on other than NVIDIA GPU devices, due to extra\nsteps in the translation, the support is always behind a few years from\nsupporting CUDA's latest features. The examples are DPC, Hipfy, where CUDA\nsource code have to be translated to their native supporting language and then\nthey are supported. In particular, the new CUDA programming model exposes the\nwarp concept in the programming language, which greatly changes the way the\nCUDA code should be mapped to CPU programs. In this paper, hierarchical\ncollapsing that \\emph{correctly} supports CUDA warp-level functions on CPUs is\nproposed. Based on hierarchical collapsing, a framework, COX, is developed that\nallows CUDA programs with the latest features to be executed efficiently on CPU\nplatforms. COX consists of a compiler IR transformation (new LLVM pass) and a\nruntime system to execute the transformed programs on CPU devices. COX can\nsupport the most recent CUDA features, and the application coverage is much\nhigher (90%) than for previous frameworks (68%) with comparable performance.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, Android is the most dominant operating system in the mobile\necosystem, with billions of people using its apps daily. As expected, this\ntrend did not go unnoticed by miscreants, and Android became the favorite\nplatform for discovering new victims through malicious apps. Moreover, these\napps have become so sophisticated that they can bypass anti-malware measures to\nprotect the users. Therefore, it is safe to admit that traditional anti-malware\ntechniques have become cumbersome, sparking the urge to develop an efficient\nway to detect Android malware.\nThis paper presents hybrid-Flacon, a hybrid pattern Android malware detection\nand categorization framework. It combines dynamic and static features of\nAndroid malware, which are from network traffic and code graph structure. In\nhybrid-Flacon, we treat network traffic as a dynamic feature and process it as\na 2D image sequence. Meanwhile, hybrid-Flacon handles each network flow in the\npacket as a 2D image and uses a bidirectional LSTM network to process those\n2D-image sequences to obtain vectors representing network packets. We use the\nprogram code graph for a static feature and introduce natural language\nprocessing (NLP) inspired techniques on function call graph (FCG). We design a\ngraph neural network-based approach to convert the whole graph structure of\nAndroid apps to vectors. Finally, We utilize those converted vectors, both\nnetwork and program code features, and concatenate them to detect and\ncategorize the malware. Our results reveal that hybrid-Flacon yields better\nresults as we get 97.16% accuracy on average for malware detection and 88.32%\naccuracy for malware categorization. Additionally, we release a dataset\nAndroNetMnist, which converts the network traffic to a 2D-image sequence and\nhelps to accomplish malware detection on a 2D-image sequence.",

Recently, various approaches have been introduced to detect\nAndroid malware, the majority of these are either based on the Manifest File\nfeatures or the structural information, such as control flow graph and API\ncalls. Among those methods, nearly all of them only consider the Java byte-code\nas the target to detect malicious behaviors. However, Recent research and our\nown statistics show that native payloads are commonly used in both benign and\nmalicious apps. Current state-of-the-art Android static analysis tools avoid\nhandling native method invocation. None of those tools have the capability to\ncapture the inter-language behaviors.\nIn this work, we explore an ensemble mechanism, which presents how the\ncombination of byte-code and native-code analysis of Android applications can\nbe efficiently used to cope with the advanced sophistication of Android\nmalware. We, therefore, present a multi-layer approach that utilizes deep\nlearning, natural language processing (NLP), as well as graph embedding\ntechniques to handle the threats of Android malware, both from the Java\nbyte-code and native code. After that, we design an ensemble algorithm to get\nthe final result of malware detection system. To be specific, the first layer\nof our detection approach operates on the byte-code of application and the\nnative code level, whereas the second layer focuses on the ensemble algorithm.\nLarge-scale experiments on 100,113 samples (35,113 malware and 65,000 benign)\nshow that only byte-code sub-system yields 99.8% accuracy and native-code\nsub-system yields an accuracy of 96.6%, whereas the Android-COCO method attains\nan accuracy of 99.86% which outperforms various related works.",

    "abstract": "Physical layer key generation (PKG) is a promising means to provide\non-the-fly shared secret keys by exploiting the intrinsic randomness of the\nradio channel. However, the performance of PKG is highly dependent on the\npropagation environments. Due to its feature of controlling the wireless\nenvironment, reconfigurable intelligent surface~(RIS) is appealing to be\napplied in PKG. In this paper, in contrast to the existing literature, we\ninvestigate both the constructive and destructive effects of RIS on the PKG\nscheme. For the constructive aspect, we have identified static and\nwave-blockage environments as two RIS-empowered-PKG applications in future\nwireless systems. In particular, our experimental results in a static\nenvironment showed that RIS can enhance the entropy of the secret key,\nachieving a key generation rate (KGR) of 97.39 bit/s with a bit disagreement\nrate (BDR) of 0.083. In multi-user systems where some remote users are in worse\nchannel conditions, the proposed RIS-assisted PKG algorithm improves the sum\nsecret key rate by more than 2 dB, compared to the literature. Furthermore, we\npoint out that RIS could be utilized by an attacker to perform new jamming and\nleakage attacks and give countermeasures, respectively.

    "abstract": "The performance of a distillation-based compressed network is governed by the\nquality of distillation. The reason for the suboptimal distillation of a large\nnetwork (teacher) to a smaller network (student) is largely attributed to the\ngap in the learning capacities of given teacher-student pair. While it is hard\nto distill all the knowledge of a teacher, the quality of distillation can be\ncontrolled to a large extent to achieve better performance. Our experiments\nshow that the quality of distillation is largely governed by the quality of\nteacher's response, which in turn is heavily affected by the presence of\nsimilarity information in its response. A well-trained large capacity teacher\nloses similarity information between classes in the process of learning\nfine-grained discriminative properties for classification. The absence of\nsimilarity information causes the distillation process to be reduced from one\nexample-many class learning to one example-one class learning, thereby\nthrottling the flow of diverse knowledge from the teacher. With the implicit\nassumption that only the instilled knowledge can be distilled, instead of\nfocusing only on the knowledge distilling process, we scrutinize the knowledge\ninculcation process. We argue that for a given teacher-student pair, the\nquality of distillation can be improved by finding the sweet spot between batch\nsize and number of epochs while training the teacher. We discuss the steps to\nfind this sweet spot for better distillation. We also propose the distillation\nhypothesis to differentiate the behavior of the distillation process between\nknowledge distillation and regularization effect.

    "abstract": "Software developers often look for solutions to their code-level problems by\nsubmitting questions to technical Q&A websites like Stack Overflow (SO). They\nusually include example code segments with questions to describe the\nprogramming issues. SO users prefer to reproduce the reported issues using the\ngiven code segments when they attempt to answer the questions. Unfortunately,\nsuch code segments could not always reproduce the issues due to several unmet\nchallenges (e.g., external library not found) that might prevent questions from\nreceiving prompt and appropriate solutions. A previous study produced a catalog\nof potential challenges that hinder the reproducibility of issues reported at\nSO questions. However, it is unknown how the practitioners (i.e., developers)\nperceive the challenge catalog. Understanding the developers' perspective is\ninevitable to introduce interactive tool support that promotes reproducibility.\nWe thus attempt to understand developers' perspectives by surveying 53 users of\nSO. In particular, we attempt to -- (1) see developers' viewpoints on the\nagreement to those challenges, (2) find the potential impact of those\nchallenges, (3) see how developers address them, and (4) determine and\nprioritize tool support needs. Survey results show that about 90% of\nparticipants agree to the already exposed challenges. However, they report some\nadditional challenges (e.g., error log missing) that might prevent\nreproducibility. According to the participants, too short code segment and\nabsence of required Class/Interface/Method from code segments severely prevent\nreproducibility, followed by missing important part of code. To promote\nreproducibility, participants strongly recommend introducing tool support that\ninteracts with question submitters with suggestions for improving the code\nsegments if the given code segments fail to reproduce the issues.",

    "abstract": "Human action recognition has drawn a lot of attention in the recent years due\nto the research and application significance. Most existing works on action\nrecognition focus on learning effective spatial-temporal features from videos,\nbut neglect the strong causal relationship among the precondition, action and\neffect. Such relationships are also crucial to the accuracy of action\nrecognition. In this paper, we propose to model the causal relationships based\non the precondition and effect to improve the performance of action\nrecognition. Specifically, a Cycle-Reasoning model is proposed to capture the\ncausal relationships for action recognition. To this end, we annotate\nprecondition and effect for a large-scale action dataset. Experimental results\nshow that the proposed Cycle-Reasoning model can effectively reason about the\nprecondition and effect and can enhance action recognition performance.",

    "abstract": "As emerging deep neural network (DNN) models continue to grow in size, using\nlarge GPU clusters to train DNNs is becoming an essential requirement to\nachieving acceptable training times. In this paper, we consider the case where\nfuture increases in cluster size will cause the global batch size that can be\nused to train models to reach a fundamental limit: beyond a certain point,\nlarger global batch sizes cause sample efficiency to degrade, increasing\noverall time to accuracy. As a result, to achieve further improvements in\ntraining performance, we must instead consider \"strong scaling\" strategies that\nhold the global batch size constant and allocate smaller batches to each GPU.\nUnfortunately, this makes it significantly more difficult to use cluster\nresources efficiently. We present DeepPool, a system that addresses this\nefficiency challenge through two key ideas. First, burst parallelism allocates\nlarge numbers of GPUs to foreground jobs in bursts to exploit the unevenness in\nparallelism across layers. Second, GPU multiplexing prioritizes throughput for\nforeground training jobs, while packing in background training jobs to reclaim\nunderutilized GPU resources, thereby improving cluster-wide utilization.\nTogether, these two ideas enable DeepPool to deliver a 2.2 - 2.4x improvement\nin total cluster throughput over standard data parallelism with a single task\nwhen the cluster scale is large.",

    "abstract": "So far, named entity recognition (NER) has been involved with three major\ntypes, including flat, overlapped (aka. nested), and discontinuous NER, which\nhave mostly been studied individually. Recently, a growing interest has been\nbuilt for unified NER, tackling the above three jobs concurrently with one\nsingle model. Current best-performing methods mainly include span-based and\nsequence-to-sequence models, where unfortunately the former merely focus on\nboundary identification and the latter may suffer from exposure bias. In this\nwork, we present a novel alternative by modeling the unified NER as word-word\nrelation classification, namely W^2NER. The architecture resolves the kernel\nbottleneck of unified NER by effectively modeling the neighboring relations\nbetween entity words with Next-Neighboring-Word (NNW) and Tail-Head-Word-*\n(THW-*) relations. Based on the W^2NER scheme we develop a neural framework, in\nwhich the unified NER is modeled as a 2D grid of word pairs. We then propose\nmulti-granularity 2D convolutions for better refining the grid representations.\nFinally, a co-predictor is used to sufficiently reason the word-word relations.\nWe perform extensive experiments on 14 widely-used benchmark datasets for flat,\noverlapped, and discontinuous NER (8 English and 6 Chinese datasets), where our\nmodel beats all the current top-performing baselines, pushing the\nstate-of-the-art performances of unified NER.",

In this paper, we present a\ndistributed robust switched model-based predictive control (DSwMPC) to control\nsuch systems that are subject to local state and input constraints. The\nproposed method guarantees stabilizing the origin of the whole closed-loop\nsystem and ensures the constraints satisfaction in the presence of an unknown\nswitching signal. In the distributed model-based predictive control (DMPC) used\nin this work, by considering the interactions among subsystems as an additive\ndisturbance, the effect of the switch is reflected on the dynamic equation,\nlocal, and consistency constraint sets of the nominal subsystems. In the\nDSwMPC, to compensate the effect of switching signal which creates a\ntime-varying network topology, a robust tube-based switched model-based\npredictive control (RSwMPC) with switched robust control invariant (switchRCI)\nset as the target set robust to unknown mode switching is used as local\ncontroller. The scheme performance is assessed using three typical examples. In\nthe first example, the switching times are unknown in prior, but the next\nneighborhood sets are assumed to be known in prior. In the second and third\ncases, both of them are supposed to be unknown in prior. The simulation results\nshow that the input and state constraints are satisfied by the proposed DSwMPC\nat all times.

    "abstract": "Dataset shift is common in credit scoring scenarios, and the inconsistency\nbetween the distribution of training data and the data that actually needs to\nbe predicted is likely to cause poor model performance. However, most of the\ncurrent studies do not take this into account, and they directly mix data from\ndifferent time periods when training the models. This brings about two\nproblems. Firstly, there is a risk of data leakage, i.e., using future data to\npredict the past. This can result in inflated results in offline validation,\nbut unsatisfactory results in practical applications. Secondly, the\nmacroeconomic environment and risk control strategies are likely to be\ndifferent in different time periods, and the behavior patterns of borrowers may\nalso change. The model trained with past data may not be applicable to the\nrecent stage. Therefore, we propose a method based on adversarial validation to\nalleviate the dataset shift problem in credit scoring scenarios. In this\nmethod, partial training set samples with the closest distribution to the\npredicted data are selected for cross-validation by adversarial validation to\nensure the generalization performance of the trained model on the predicted\nsamples. In addition, through a simple splicing method, samples in the training\ndata that are inconsistent with the test data distribution are also involved in\nthe training process of cross-validation, which makes full use of all the data\nand further improves the model performance. To verify the effectiveness of the\nproposed method, comparative experiments with several other data split methods\nare conducted with the data provided by Lending Club.

While recent years have witnessed many promising news\nrecommendation models, they mostly capture the user-news interactions on the\ndocument-level in a static manner. However, in real-world scenarios, the news\ncan be quite complex and diverse, blindly squeezing all the contents into an\nembedding vector can be less effective in extracting information compatible\nwith the personalized preference of the users.

By utilizing the statistical properties of the channel,\nstate-of-the-art covariance based methods have been demonstrated to achieve\nbetter activity detection performance than compressed sensing based methods.\nHowever, covariance based methods require to solve a high dimensional nonconvex\noptimization problem by updating the estimate of the activity status of each\ndevice sequentially.

By adopting an\nattention mechanism in the architecture design, the proposed method is able to\nextract the relevance between device pilots and received signal, is permutation\nequivariant with respect to devices, and is scale adaptable to different\nnumbers of devices.

    "abstract": "In facial landmark localization tasks, various occlusions heavily degrade the\nlocalization accuracy due to the partial observability of facial features. This\npaper proposes a structural relation network (SRN) for occlusion-robust\nlandmark localization. Unlike most existing methods that simply exploit the\nshape constraint, the proposed SRN aims to capture the structural relations\namong different facial components. These relations can be considered a more\npowerful shape constraint against occlusion. To achieve this, a hierarchical\nstructural relation module (HSRM) is designed to hierarchically reason the\nstructural relations that represent both long- and short-distance spatial\ndependencies. Compared with existing network architectures, HSRM can\nefficiently model the spatial relations by leveraging its geometry-aware\nnetwork architecture, which reduces the semantic ambiguity caused by occlusion.\nMoreover, the SRN augments the training data by synthesizing occluded faces. To\nfurther extend our SRN for occluded video data, we formulate the occluded face\nsynthesis as a Markov decision process (MDP). Specifically, it plans the\nmovement of the dynamic occlusion based on an accumulated reward associated\nwith the performance degradation of the pre-trained SRN. This procedure\naugments hard samples for robust facial landmark tracking. Extensive\nexperimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves outstanding\nperformance on occluded and masked faces. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/zhuccly/SRN.",

    "abstract": "Threat information sharing is considered as one of the proactive defensive\napproaches for enhancing the overall security of trusted partners. Trusted\npartner organizations can provide access to past and current cybersecurity\nthreats for reducing the risk of a potential cyberattack - the requirements for\nthreat information sharing range from simplistic sharing of documents to threat\nintelligence sharing. Therefore, the storage and sharing of highly sensitive\nthreat information raises considerable concerns regarding constructing a\nsecure, trusted threat information exchange infrastructure. Establishing a\ntrusted ecosystem for threat sharing will promote the validity, security,\nanonymity, scalability, latency efficiency, and traceability of the stored\ninformation that protects it from unauthorized disclosure. This paper proposes\na system that ensures the security principles mentioned above by utilizing a\ndistributed ledger technology that provides secure decentralized operations\nthrough smart contracts and provides a privacy-preserving ecosystem for threat\ninformation storage and sharing regarding the MITRE ATT\\&CK framework.",

    "abstract": "We give new polynomial lower bounds for a number of dynamic measure problems\nin computational geometry. These lower bounds hold in the the Word-RAM model,\nconditioned on the hardness of either the 3SUM problem or the Online\nMatrix-Vector Mutliplication problem [Henzinger et al., STOC 2015]. In\nparticular we get lower bounds in the incremental and fully-dynamic settings\nfor counting maximal or extremal points in R^3, different variants of Klee's\nMeasure Problem, problems related to finding the largest empty disk in a set of\npoints, and querying the size of the i'th convex layer in a planar set of\npoints. While many conditional lower bounds for dynamic data structures have\nbeen proven since the seminal work of Patrascu [STOC 2010], few of them relate\nto computational geometry problems. This is the first paper focusing on this\ntopic. The problems we consider can all be solved in O(n log n) time in the\nstatic case and their dynamic versions have mostly been approached from the\nperspective of improving known upper bounds. One exception to this is Klee's\nmeasure problem in R^2, for which Chan [CGTA 2010] gave an unconditional\n{\\Omega}(\\sqrt{n}) lower bound on the worst-case update time. By a similar\napproach, we show that this also holds for an important special case of Klee's\nmeasure problem in R^3 known as the Hypervolume Indicator problem.",

    "abstract": "Benefiting from the development of generative adversarial networks (GAN),\nfacial manipulation has achieved significant progress in both academia and\nindustry recently. It inspires an increasing number of entertainment\napplications but also incurs severe threats to individual privacy and even\npolitical security meanwhile. To mitigate such risks, many countermeasures have\nbeen proposed. However, the great majority methods are designed in a passive\nmanner, which is to detect whether the facial images or videos are tampered\nafter their wide propagation. These detection-based methods have a fatal\nlimitation, that is, they only work for ex-post forensics but can not prevent\nthe engendering of malicious behavior. To address the limitation, in this\npaper, we propose a novel framework of initiative defense to degrade the\nperformance of facial manipulation models controlled by malicious users. The\nbasic idea is to actively inject imperceptible venom into target facial data\nbefore manipulation. To this end, we first imitate the target manipulation\nmodel with a surrogate model, and then devise a poison perturbation generator\nto obtain the desired venom. An alternating training strategy are further\nleveraged to train both the surrogate model and the perturbation generator. Two\ntypical facial manipulation tasks: face attribute editing and face reenactment,\nare considered in our initiative defense framework. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework in different\nsettings. Finally, we hope this work can shed some light on initiative\ncountermeasures against more adversarial scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Fuzzing is one of the most popular and widely used techniques to find\nvulnerabilities in any application. Fuzzers are fast enough, but they still\nspend a good portion of time to restart a crashed application and then fuzz it\nfrom the beginning. Fuzzing an application from a point deeper in the execution\nis also important. To do this, a user needs to take a snapshot of the program\nwhile fuzzing it on top of an emulator, virtual machine, or by utilizing a\nspecial kernel module to enable checkpointing. Even with this ability, it can\nbe difficult to attach a fuzzer after restoring a checkpoint. As a result, most\nfuzzers leverage a form of fork-server design.\nWe propose a novel testing architecture that allows users to attach a fuzzer\nafter the program has started running. We do this by natively checkpointing the\ntarget application at a point of interest, and attaching the fuzzer after\nrestoring the checkpoint. A fork-server may even be engaged at the point of\nrestoration. This not only improves the throughput of the fuzzing campaign by\nminimizing startup time, but opens up a new way to fuzz applications. With this\narchitecture, a user can take a series of checkpoints at points of interest,\nand run parallel tests to reduce the overall state-complexity of an individual\ntest. Checkpoints allow us to begin fuzzing from a deeper point in the\nexecution path, omitting prior execution from the required coverage path. This\nand other checkpointing techniques are described in the paper to help improve\nfuzzing.",

In recent years, approaches in this respect based on machine learning\nhave been reported with promising performance.

Its convenience led to an exponentially increasing amount\nof financial data, which is however hard to use for the prediction of future\nprices, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the non-stationarity of\nfinancial time series. Simpler classification tasks -- where the goal is to\npredict the directions of future price movement -- via supervised learning\nalgorithms, need sufficiently reliable labels to generalise well. Labelling\nfinancial data is however less well defined than other domains: did the price\ngo up because of noise or because of signal? The existing labelling methods\nhave limited countermeasures against noise and limited effects in improving\nlearning algorithms. This work takes inspiration from image classification in\ntrading and success in self-supervised learning. We investigate the idea of\napplying computer vision techniques to financial time-series to reduce the\nnoise exposure and hence generate correct labels. We look at the label\ngeneration as the pretext task of a self-supervised learning approach and\ncompare the naive (and noisy) labels, commonly used in the literature, with the\nlabels generated by a denoising autoencoder for the same downstream\nclassification task. Our results show that our denoised labels improve the\nperformances of the downstream learning algorithm, for both small and large\ndatasets. We further show that the signals we obtain can be used to effectively\ntrade with binary strategies.

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are able to\ngreatly reduce computational costs and memory footprints, facilitating model\ndeployment on resource-constrained devices. However, in comparison to their\nfull-precision counterparts, BNNs suffer from severe accuracy degradation.\nResearch aiming to reduce this accuracy gap has thus far largely focused on\nspecific network architectures with few or no 1x1 convolutional layers, for\nwhich standard binarization methods do not work well. Because 1x1 convolutions\nare common in the design of modern architectures (e.g. GoogleNet, ResNet,\nDenseNet), it is crucial to develop a method to binarize them effectively for\nBNNs to be more widely adopted. In this work, we propose an \"Elastic-Link\" (EL)\nmodule to enrich information flow within a BNN by adaptively adding real-valued\ninput features to the subsequent convolutional output features. The proposed EL\nmodule is easily implemented and can be used in conjunction with other methods\nfor BNNs. We demonstrate that adding EL to BNNs produces a significant\nimprovement on the challenging large-scale ImageNet dataset. For example, we\nraise the top-1 accuracy of binarized ResNet26 from 57.9% to 64.0%. EL also\naids convergence in the training of binarized MobileNet, for which a top-1\naccuracy of 56.4% is achieved. Finally, with the integration of ReActNet, it\nyields a new state-of-the-art result of 71.9% top-1 accuracy.",

    "abstract": "One of the significant problems of streaming data classification is the\noccurrence of concept drift, consisting of the change of probabilistic\ncharacteristics of the classification task. This phenomenon destabilizes the\nperformance of the classification model and seriously degrades its quality.

One of the\nsignificant problems in implementing such a solution is the access to data\nlabels.

    "abstract": "Clustering is widely used in text analysis, natural language processing,\nimage segmentation, and other data mining fields. As a promising clustering\nalgorithm, the evidential c-means (ECM) can provide a deeper insight on the\ndata by allowing an object to belong to several subsets of classes, which\nextends those of hard, fuzzy, and possibilistic clustering. However, as it\nneeds to estimate much more parameters than the other classical partition-based\nalgorithms, it only works well when the available data is sufficient and of\ngood quality. In order to overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes a\ntransfer evidential c-means (TECM) algorithm, by introducing the strategy of\ntransfer learning. The objective function of TECM is obtained by introducing\nbarycenters in the source domain on the basis of the objective function of ECM,\nand the iterative optimization strategy is used to solve the objective\nfunction. In addition, the TECM can adapt to situation where the number of\nclusters in the source domain and the target domain is different. The proposed\nalgorithm has been validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Traditionally this is done by modeling it as pair-wise\ninteraction at a particular time in a dynamic network. However, real-world\ninteractions are seldom pair-wise; they can involve more than two nodes. In\nliterature, these types of group interactions are modeled by\nhyperedges/hyperlinks. The existing works for hyperedge modeling focused only\non static networks, and they cannot model the temporal evolution of nodes as\nthey interact with other nodes. Also, they cannot answer temporal queries like\nwhich type of interaction will occur next and when the interaction will occur.\nTo address these limitations, in this paper, we develop a temporal point\nprocess model for hyperlink prediction. Our proposed model uses dynamic\nrepresentation techniques for nodes to model the evolution and uses this\nrepresentation in a neural point process framework to make inferences. We\nevaluate our models on five real-world interaction data and show that our\ndynamic model has significant performance gain over the static model.

This paper aims at extracting the local\nroad network topology, directly in the bird's-eye-view (BEV), all in a complex\nurban setting. The only input consists of a single onboard, forward looking\ncamera image. We represent the road topology using a set of directed lane\ncurves and their interactions, which are captured using their intersection\npoints. To better capture topology, we introduce the concept of \\emph{minimal\ncycles} and their covers. A minimal cycle is the smallest cycle formed by the\ndirected curve segments (between two intersections). The cover is a set of\ncurves whose segments are involved in forming a minimal cycle. We first show\nthat the covers suffice to uniquely represent the road topology. The covers are\nthen used to supervise deep neural networks, along with the lane curve\nsupervision. These learn to predict the road topology from a single input\nimage. The results on the NuScenes and Argoverse benchmarks are significantly\nbetter than those obtained with baselines.

Proactive approaches are needed to predict package\nvulnerability to high-risk supply chain attacks.\nThe goal of this work is to help software developers and security specialists\nidentify weak links in a software supply chain by empirically studying npm\npackage metadata.\nIn this paper, we analyzed the metadata of 1.63 million JavaScript npm\npackages. We propose six signals of a security weakness in a software supply\nchain, such as the presence of install scripts, maintainer accounts associated\nwith an expired email domain, and inactive packages with inactive maintainers.\nOur analysis identified 11 malicious packages from the install scripts signal.\nWe also found 2,818 maintainer email addresses associated with expired domains,\nallowing an attacker to hijack 8,494 packages by taking over the npm accounts.\nWe obtained feedback on our weak link signals through a survey responded to\nby 470 npm package developers.

    "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs),\nrecent works on face-based age estimation employ these networks as the\nbackbone. However, state-of-the-art CNN-based methods treat each facial region\nequally, thus entirely ignoring the importance of some facial patches that may\ncontain rich age-specific information. In this paper, we propose a face-based\nage estimation framework, called Attention-based Dynamic Patch Fusion (ADPF).\nIn ADPF, two separate CNNs are implemented, namely the AttentionNet and the\nFusionNet. The AttentionNet dynamically locates and ranks age-specific patches\nby employing a novel Ranking-guided Multi-Head Hybrid Attention (RMHHA)\nmechanism. The FusionNet uses the discovered patches along with the facial\nimage to predict the age of the subject. Since the proposed RMHHA mechanism\nranks the discovered patches based on their importance, the length of the\nlearning path of each patch in the FusionNet is proportional to the amount of\ninformation it carries (the longer, the more important). ADPF also introduces a\nnovel diversity loss to guide the training of the AttentionNet and reduce the\noverlap among patches so that the diverse and important patches are discovered.\nThrough extensive experiments, we show that our proposed framework outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on several age estimation benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "With AI systems becoming more powerful and pervasive, there is increasing\ndebate about keeping their actions aligned with the broader goals and needs of\nhumanity. This multi-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder debate must resolve\nmany issues, here we examine three of them. The first issue is to clarify what\ndemands stakeholders might usefully make on the designers of AI systems, useful\nbecause the technology exists to implement them. We make this technical topic\nmore accessible by using the framing of cognitive architectures. The second\nissue is to move beyond an analytical framing that treats useful intelligence\nas being reward maximization only. To support this move, we define several AI\ncognitive architectures that combine reward maximization with other technical\nelements designed to improve alignment. The third issue is how stakeholders\nshould calibrate their interactions with modern machine learning researchers.\nWe consider how current fashions in machine learning create a narrative pull\nthat participants in technical and policy discussions should be aware of, so\nthat they can compensate for it. We identify several technically tractable but\ncurrently unfashionable options for improving AI alignment.",

While it admits a\nsimple 2-approximation in polynomial time in general metrics, the Euclidean\nversion is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of 1.93, even in the plane,\nif one insists the dependence on $k$ in the running time be polynomial. Without\nthis restriction, a classic algorithm yields a $2^{O((k\\log\nk)/{\\epsilon})}dn$-time $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation for Euclidean $k$-center,\nwhere $d$ is the dimension.\nWe give a faster algorithm for small dimensions: roughly speaking an\n$O^*(2^{O((1/\\epsilon)^{O(d)} \\cdot k^{1-1/d} \\cdot \\log k)})$-time\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation. In particular, the running time is roughly\n$O^*(2^{O((1/\\epsilon)^{O(1)}\\sqrt{k}\\log k)})$ in the plane. We complement our\nalgorithmic result with a matching hardness lower bound.\nWe also consider a well-studied generalization of $k$-center, called\nNon-uniform $k$-center (NUkC), where we allow different radii clusters. NUkC is\nNP-hard to approximate within any factor, even in the Euclidean case.

Therefore, we propose an end-to-end method that\nsimultaneously detects 2D keypoints from an image and lifts them to 3D. The\nproposed method learns both 2D detection and 3D lifting only from 2D keypoints\nannotations. In this regard, a novel method that explicitly disentangles the\npose and 3D shape by means of augmentation-based cyclic self-supervision is\nproposed, for the first time. In addition of being end-to-end in image to 3D\nlearning, our method also handles objects from multiple categories using a\nsingle neural network. We use a Transformer-based architecture to detect the\nkeypoints, as well as to summarize the visual context of the image. This visual\ncontext information is then used while lifting the keypoints to 3D, so as to\nallow the context-based reasoning for better performance. While lifting, our\nmethod learns a small set of basis shapes and their sparse non-negative\ncoefficients to represent the 3D shape in canonical frame.

The Nash welfare of an allocation is\nthe weighted geometric mean of agents' utilities, and the allocation with\nmaximum Nash welfare is known to satisfy several desirable fairness and\nefficiency properties. However, computing such an MNW allocation is APX-hard\n(hard to approximate) in general, even when agents have additive valuation\nfunctions. Hence, we aim to identify tractable classes which either admit a\npolynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) or an exact polynomial-time\nalgorithm.\nTo this end, we design a PTAS for finding an MNW allocation for the case of\nasymmetric agents with identical, additive valuations, thus generalizing a\nsimilar result for symmetric agents. Our techniques can also be adapted to give\na PTAS for the problem of computing the optimal $p$-mean welfare. We also show\nthat an MNW allocation can be computed exactly in polynomial time for identical\nagents with $k$-ary valuations when $k$ is a constant, where every agent has at\nmost $k$ different values for the goods.\nNext, we consider the special case where every agent finds at most two goods\nvaluable, and show that this class admits an efficient algorithm, even for\ngeneral monotone valuations. In contrast, we show that when agents can value\nthree or more goods, maximizing Nash welfare is APX-hard, even when agents are\nsymmetric and have additive valuations.\nFinally, we show that for constantly many asymmetric agents with additive\nvaluations, the MNW problem admits a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme\n(FPTAS).",

    "title": "Symbolic Specialization of Rewriting Logic Theories with Presto",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces Presto, a symbolic partial evaluator for Maude's\nrewriting logic theories that can improve system analysis and verification. In\nPresto, the automated optimization of a conditional rewrite theory R (whose\nrules define the concurrent transitions of a system) is achieved by partially\nevaluating, with respect to the rules of R, an underlying, companion equational\nlogic theory E that specifies the algebraic structure of the system states of\nR. This can be particularly useful for specializing an overly general\nequational theory E whose operators may obey complex combinations of\nassociativity, commutativity, and/or identity axioms, when being plugged into a\nhost rewrite theory R as happens, for instance, in protocol analysis, where\nsophisticated equational theories for cryptography are used. Presto implements\ndifferent unfolding operators that are based on folding variant narrowing (the\nsymbolic engine of Maude's equational theories). When combined with an\nappropriate abstraction algorithm, they allow the specialization to be adapted\nto the theory termination behavior and bring significant improvement while\nensuring strong correctness and termination of the specialization. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of Presto in several examples of protocol\nanalysis where it achieves a significant speed-up. Actually, the transformation\nprovided by Presto may cut down an infinite folding variant narrowing space to\na finite one, and moreover, some of the costly algebraic axioms and rule\nconditions may be eliminated as well. As far as we know, this is the first\npartial evaluator for Maude that respects the semantics of functional, logic,\nconcurrent, and object-oriented computations.

First, we learn to encode articulated human\nmotions on a dense UV manifold of the human body surface. To handle complicated\nmotions (e.g., self-occlusions), we then leverage the encoded information on\nthe UV manifold to construct a 3D volumetric representation based on a dynamic\npose-conditioned neural radiance field. While this allows us to represent 3D\ngeometry with changing topology, volumetric rendering is computationally heavy.\nHence we employ only a rough volumetric representation using a pose-conditioned\ndownsampled neural radiance field (PD-NeRF), which we can render efficiently at\nlow resolutions. In addition, we learn 2D textural features that are fused with\nrendered volumetric features in image space. The key advantage of our approach\nis that we can then convert the fused features into a high resolution,\nhigh-quality avatar by a fast GAN-based textural renderer. We demonstrate that\nhybrid rendering enables HVTR to handle complicated motions, render\nhigh-quality avatars under user-controlled poses/shapes and even loose\nclothing, and most importantly, be fast at inference time.

In addition, we characterize novel\ncoverage probability expressions for THz network in the presence of molecular\nabsorption noise and highlight its significant impact on the users'\nperformance. Specifically, we derive a novel closed-form expression for the\nLaplace Transform of the cumulative molecular noise and interference observed\nby a mobile user in a hybrid RF-THz network. Furthermore, we provide a novel\napproximation to derive the conditional distance distributions of a typical\nuser in a hybrid RF-THz network. Finally, using the overall HO probability and\ncoverage probability expressions, the mobility-aware probability of coverage\nhas been derived in a hybrid RF-THz network. Our mathematical results validate\nthe correctness of the derived expressions using Monte-Carlo simulations. The\nresults offer insights into the adverse impact of users' mobility and molecular\nnoise in THz transmissions on the probability of coverage of mobile users. Our\nresults demonstrate that a small increase in the intensity of terahertz\nbase-stations (TBSs) (about 5 times) can increase the HO probability much more\ncompared to the case when the intensity of RF BSs (RBSs) is increased by 100\ntimes. Furthermore, we note that high molecular absorption can be beneficial\n(in terms of minimizing interference and molecular noise) for specific\ndeployment intensity of TBSs and the benefits can outweigh the drawbacks of\nsignal degradation due to molecular absorption.",

The primary operations of the 3D\nSIFT code are implemented on a graphics processing unit (GPU), including\nconvolution, sub-sampling, and 4D peak detection from scale-space pyramids. The\nperformance improvements are quantified in keypoint detection and\nimage-to-image matching experiments, using 3D MRI human brain volumes of\ndifferent people. Computationally efficient 3D keypoint descriptors are\nproposed based on the Binary Robust Independent Elementary Feature (BRIEF)\ncode, including a novel descriptor we call Ranked Robust Independent Elementary\nFeatures (RRIEF), and compared to the original 3D SIFT-Rank\nmethod\\citep{toews2013efficient}. The GPU implementation affords a speedup of\napproximately 7X beyond an optimised CPU implementation, where computation time\nis reduced from 1.4 seconds to 0.2 seconds for 3D volumes of size (145, 174,\n145) voxels with approximately 3000 keypoints. Notable speedups include the\nconvolution operation (20X), 4D peak detection (3X), sub-sampling (3X), and\ndifference-of-Gaussian pyramid construction (2X). Efficient descriptors offer a\nspeedup of 2X and a memory savings of 6X compared to standard SIFT-Rank\ndescriptors, at a cost of reduced numbers of keypoint correspondences,\nrevealing a trade-off between computational efficiency and algorithmic\nperformance. The speedups gained by our implementation will allow for a more\nefficient analysis on larger data sets.

Understanding consumers'\nopinions toward different aspects can help evaluate business performance in\ndetail and strategize business operations effectively. Specifically, we aim to\nanswer interventional questions such as What will the restaurant popularity be\nif the quality w.r.t. its aspect Service is increased by 10%? The defining\nchallenge of causal inference with observational data is the presence of\n\"confounder\", which might not be observed or measured, e.g., consumers'\npreference to food type, rendering the estimated effects biased and\nhigh-variance. To address this challenge, we have recourse to the multi-modal\nproxies such as the consumer profile information and interactions between\nconsumers and businesses.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider two coupled problems for distributed multi-robot\nsystems (MRSs) coordinating with limited field of view (FOV) sensors: adaptive\ntuning of interaction gains and rejection of sensor attacks. First, a typical\nshortcoming of distributed control frameworks (e.g., potential fields) is that\nthe overall system behavior is highly sensitive to the gain assigned to\nrelative interactions. Second, MRSs with limited FOV sensors can be more\nsusceptible to sensor attacks aimed at their FOVs, and therefore must be\nresilient to such attacks. Based on these shortcomings, we propose a\ncomprehensive solution that combines efforts in adaptive gain tuning and attack\nresilience to the problem of topology control for MRSs with limited FOVs.\nSpecifically, we first derive an adaptive gain tuning scheme based on\nsatisfying nominal pairwise interactions, which yields a dynamic balancing of\ninteraction strengths in a robot's neighborhood. We then model additive sensor\nand actuator attacks (or faults) and derive H infinity control protocols by\nemploying a static output-feedback technique, guaranteeing bounded L2 gains of\nthe error induced by the attack (fault) signals.

Specifically,\nwe conduct a data-driven study of the timing, power, and memory performance of\nkernels for localization and mapping, path planning, task allocation, depth\nestimation, and optical flow, across three embedded computing platforms. We\nprofile and analyze these kernels to provide insight into scheduling and\ndynamic resource management for computation-aware autonomous robots. Notably,\nour results show that there is a correlation of kernel performance with a\nrobot's operational environment, justifying the notion of computation-aware\nrobots and why our work is a crucial step towards this goal.",

    "abstract": "At present, the existing gait recognition systems are focusing on developing\nmethods to extract robust gait feature from silhouette images and they indeed\nachieved great success. However, gait can be sensitive to appearance features\nsuch as clothing and carried items. Compared with appearance-based method,\nmodel-based gait recognition is promising due to the robustness against these\nvariations. In recent years, with the development of human pose estimation, the\ndifficulty of model-based gait recognition methods has been mitigated. In this\npaper, to resist the increase of subjects and views variation, local features\nare built and a siamese network is proposed to maximize the distance of samples\nfrom the same subject. We leverage recent advances in action recognition to\nembed human pose sequence to a vector and introduce Spatial-Temporal Graph\nConvolution Blocks (STGCB) which has been commonly used in action recognition\nfor gait recognition. Experiments on the very large population dataset named\nOUMVLP-Pose and the popular dataset, CASIA-B, show that our method archives\nsome state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances in model-based gait recognition.

    "abstract": "Most modern face completion approaches adopt an autoencoder or its variants\nto restore missing regions in face images. Encoders are often utilized to learn\npowerful representations that play an important role in meeting the challenges\nof sophisticated learning tasks. Specifically, various kinds of masks are often\npresented in face images in the wild, forming complex patterns, especially in\nthis hard period of COVID-19. It's difficult for encoders to capture such\npowerful representations under this complex situation. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a self-supervised Siamese inference network to improve\nthe generalization and robustness of encoders. It can encode contextual\nsemantics from full-resolution images and obtain more discriminative\nrepresentations. To deal with geometric variations of face images, a dense\ncorrespondence field is integrated into the network. We further propose a\nmulti-scale decoder with a novel dual attention fusion module (DAF), which can\ncombine the restored and known regions in an adaptive manner. This multi-scale\narchitecture is beneficial for the decoder to utilize discriminative\nrepresentations learned from encoders into images. Extensive experiments\nclearly demonstrate that the proposed approach not only achieves more appealing\nresults compared with state-of-the-art methods but also improves the\nperformance of masked face recognition dramatically.",

    "abstract": "Federated edge learning (FEEL) has attracted much attention as a\nprivacy-preserving paradigm to effectively incorporate the distributed data at\nthe network edge for training deep learning models. Nevertheless, the limited\ncoverage of a single edge server results in an insufficient number of\nparticipated client nodes, which may impair the learning performance. In this\npaper, we investigate a novel framework of FEEL, namely semi-decentralized\nfederated edge learning (SD-FEEL), where multiple edge servers are employed to\ncollectively coordinate a large number of client nodes. By exploiting the\nlow-latency communication among edge servers for efficient model sharing,\nSD-FEEL can incorporate more training data, while enjoying much lower latency\ncompared with conventional federated learning. We detail the training algorithm\nfor SD-FEEL with three main steps, including local model update, intra-cluster,\nand inter-cluster model aggregations. The convergence of this algorithm is\nproved on non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, which\nalso helps to reveal the effects of key parameters on the training efficiency\nand provides practical design guidelines. Meanwhile, the heterogeneity of edge\ndevices may cause the straggler effect and deteriorate the convergence speed of\nSD-FEEL. To resolve this issue, we propose an asynchronous training algorithm\nwith a staleness-aware aggregation scheme for SD-FEEL, of which, the\nconvergence performance is also analyzed. The simulation results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms for SD-FEEL and\ncorroborate our analysis.",

    "abstract": "False claims that have been previously fact-checked can still spread on\nsocial media. To mitigate their continual spread, detecting previously\nfact-checked claims is indispensable. Given a claim, existing works focus on\nproviding evidence for detection by reranking candidate fact-checking articles\n(FC-articles) retrieved by BM25. However, these performances may be limited\nbecause they ignore the following characteristics of FC-articles: (1) claims\nare often quoted to describe the checked events, providing lexical information\nbesides semantics; (2) sentence templates to introduce or debunk claims are\ncommon across articles, providing pattern information. Models that ignore the\ntwo aspects only leverage semantic relevance and may be misled by sentences\nthat describe similar but irrelevant events. In this paper, we propose a novel\nreranker, MTM (Memory-enhanced Transformers for Matching) to rank FC-articles\nusing key sentences selected with event (lexical and semantic) and pattern\ninformation. For event information, we propose a ROUGE-guided Transformer which\nis finetuned with regression of ROUGE. For pattern information, we generate\npattern vectors for matching with sentences. By fusing event and pattern\ninformation, we select key sentences to represent an article and then predict\nif the article fact-checks the given claim using the claim, key sentences, and\npatterns. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that MTM outperforms\nexisting methods. Human evaluation proves that MTM can capture key sentences\nfor explanations.

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce a method and present an improved neural work to\nperform product re-identification, which is an essential core function of a\nfully automated product defect detection system. Our method is based on feature\ndistance. It is the combination of feature extraction neural networks, such as\nVGG16, AlexNet, with an image search engine - Vearch. The dataset that we used\nto develop product re-identification systems is a water-bottle dataset that\nconsists of 400 images of 18 types of water bottles. This is a small dataset,\nwhich was the biggest challenge of our work. However, the combination of neural\nnetworks with Vearch shows potential to tackle the product re-identification\nproblems. Especially, our new neural network - AlphaAlexNet that a neural\nnetwork was improved based on AlexNet could improve the production\nidentification accuracy by four percent. This indicates that an ideal\nproduction identification accuracy could be achieved when efficient feature\nextraction methods could be introduced and redesigned for image feature\nextractions of nearly identical products. In order to solve the biggest\nchallenges caused by the small size of the dataset and the difficult nature of\nidentifying productions that have little differences from each other. In our\nfuture work, we propose a new roadmap to tackle nearly-identical production\nidentifications: to introduce or develop new algorithms that need very few\nimages to train themselves.",

Therefore, organizations rely on Cyber Situational\nAwareness (CSA) to support them in better understanding the threats and\nassociated impacts of cyber events. Due to the heterogeneity and complexity of\ncyber security data, often with multidimensional attributes, sophisticated\nvisualization techniques are often needed to achieve CSA. However, there have\nbeen no attempts to systematically review and analyze scientific literature on\nCSA visualizations until now.

Furthermore, we analyze the\nlevel of CSA supported by the visualizations, maturity of the visualizations,\nchallenges, and practices related to CSA visualizations to prepare a full\nanalysis of the current state of CSA in the organizational context. Our results\nreveal certain gaps in CSA visualizations. For instance, the most focus is on\noperational-level staff and there is a clear lack of visualizations targeting\nother types of stakeholders such as managers, higher-level decision makers, and\nnon-expert users. Most papers focus on threat information visualization and\nthere is a lack of papers that visualize impact information, response plans,\nand information shared within teams.

Our analysis helps characterize the nature of this\nproblem, identify correlated factors, and determine the impacts of\ninconsistency on downstream tasks. Our findings observe that SV severity often\nlacks consideration or is underestimated during initial reporting, and such SVs\nconsequently receive lower prioritization. We identify six potential attributes\nthat are correlated to this misjudgment, and show that inconsistency in\nseverity reporting schemes can severely degrade the performance of downstream\nseverity prediction by up to 77%. Our findings help raise awareness of SV\nseverity data inconsistencies and draw attention to this data quality problem.\nThese insights can help developers better consider SV severity data sources,\nand improve the reliability of consequent SV prioritization.

    "abstract": "Security issue reports are the primary means of informing development teams\nof security risks in projects, but little is known about current practices. We\naim to understand the characteristics of these reports in open-source projects\nand uncover opportunities to improve developer practices. We analysed 3,493\nsecurity issue reports in 182 different projects on GitHub and manually studied\n333 reports, and their discussions and pull requests. We found that, the number\nof security issue reports has increased over time, they are resolved faster,\nand they are reported in earlier development stages compared to past years.\nNevertheless, a tiny group of developers are involved frequently, security\nissues progress slowly, and a great number of them has been pending for a long\ntime. We realized that only a small subset of security issue reports include\nreproducibility data, a potential fix is rarely suggested, and there is no hint\nregarding how a reporter spotted an issue. We noted that the resolution time of\nan issue is significantly shorter when the first reaction to a security report\nis fast and when a reference to a known vulnerability exists.",

Recent work concentrates on utilizing the timing\nprocessing ability of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to achieve smooth and\nreliable results in short-term prediction. However, as evidenced by previous\nwork, RNNs suffer from errors accumulation, leading to unreliable results. In\nthis paper, we propose a simple feed-forward deep neural network for motion\nprediction, which takes into account temporal smoothness and spatial\ndependencies between human body joints. We design a Multi-scale Spatio-temporal\ngraph convolutional networks (GCNs) to implicitly establish the Spatio-temporal\ndependence in the process of human movement, where different scales fused\ndynamically during training. The entire model is suitable for all actions and\nfollows a framework of encoder-decoder. The encoder consists of temporal GCNs\nto capture motion features between frames and semi-autonomous learned spatial\nGCNs to extract spatial structure among joint trajectories. The decoder uses\ntemporal convolution networks (TCNs) to maintain its extensive ability.\nExtensive experiments show that our approach outperforms SOTA methods on the\ndatasets of Human3.6M and CMU Mocap while only requiring much lesser\nparameters.

Existing local-to-global learning algorithms first\nconstruct the skeleton of a DAG (directed acyclic graph) by learning the MB\n(Markov blanket) or PC (parents and children) of each variable in a data set,\nthen orient edges in the skeleton. However, existing MB or PC learning methods\nare often computationally expensive especially with a large-sized BN, resulting\nin inefficient local-to-global learning algorithms. To tackle the problem, in\nthis paper, we develop an efficient local-to-global learning approach using\nfeature selection.

The F2SL approach first employs the MRMR\napproach to learn a DAG skeleton, then orients edges in the skeleton.

Based on the optimization, a novel multi-agent communication\nmodule, called CommGIB, is proposed, which effectively compresses the structure\ninformation and node information in the communication graph to deal with\nbandwidth-constrained settings.

Given two positive integers $w$ and $k$, it selects the\nlexicographically smallest length-$k$ substring in every fragment of $w$\nconsecutive length-$k$ substrings (in every sliding window of length $w + k -\n1$). Minimizers samples are approximately uniform, locally consistent, and\ncomputable in linear time. Two main disadvantages of minimizers sampling\nmechanisms are: first, they do not have good guarantees on the expected size of\ntheir samples for every combination of $w$ and $k$; and, second, indexes that\nare constructed over their samples do not have good worst-case guarantees for\non-line pattern searches.\nWe introduce bidirectional string anchors (bd-anchors), a new string sampling\nmechanism. Given a positive integer $\\ell$, our mechanism selects the\nlexicographically smallest rotation in every length-$\\ell$ fragment (in every\nsliding window of length $\\ell$). We show that bd-anchors samples are also\napproximately uniform, locally consistent, and computable in linear time. In\naddition, our experiments using several datasets demonstrate that the\nbd-anchors sample sizes decrease proportionally to $\\ell$; and that these sizes\nare competitive to or smaller than the minimizers sample sizes using the\nanalogous sampling parameters. We provide theoretical justification for these\nresults by analyzing the expected size of bd-anchors samples. As a negative\nresult, we show that computing a total order $\\leq$ on the input alphabet,\nwhich minimizes the bd-anchors sample size, is NP-hard. We also show that by\nusing any bd-anchors sample, we can construct, in near-linear time, an index\nwhich requires linear (extra) space in the size of the sample and answers\non-line pattern searches in near-optimal time.",

While L2O has been applied to various problems, a crucial yet\nchallenging class of problems -- robust combinatorial optimization in the form\nof minimax optimization -- have largely remained under-explored. In addition to\nthe exponentially large decision space, a key challenge for robust\ncombinatorial optimization lies in the inner optimization problem, which is\ntypically non-convex and entangled with outer optimization. In this paper, we\nstudy robust combinatorial optimization and propose a novel learning-based\noptimizer, called LRCO (Learning for Robust Combinatorial Optimization), which\nquickly outputs a robust solution in the presence of uncertain context.

The crack\nclassification, segmentation performance, and effect were tested on the\nSDNET2018 and CFD public data sets. In the aspect of patch sample\nclassification, the fine-tuned TL models can be equivalent to or even slightly\nbetter than the ED models in accuracy, and the predicting time is faster; In\nthe aspect of accurate crack location, both ED and GAN algorithms can achieve\npixel-level segmentation and is expected to be detected in real time on low\ncomputing power platform. Furthermore, a weakly supervised learning framework\nof combined TL-SSGAN and its performance enhancement measures are proposed,\nwhich can maintain comparable crack identification performance with that of the\nsupervised learning, while greatly reducing the number of labeled samples\nrequired.",

We\nmeasure the timeliness of the information stored at the receiver via the Age of\nInformation (AoI), the time elapsed since the freshest sample stored at the\nreceiver is generated. The goal is to design a sampling strategy that minimizes\nthe total cost of the expected time average AoI and sampling cost in the\nabsence of transmission delay statistics. We reformulate the total cost\nminimization problem as the optimization of a renewal-reward process, and\npropose an online sampling strategy based on the Robbins-Monro algorithm. We\nshow that, when the transmission delay is bounded, the expected time average\ntotal cost obtained by the proposed online algorithm converges to the minimum\ncost when $K$ goes to infinity, and the optimality gap decays with rate\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\ln K/K\\right)$, where $K$ is the number of samples we have\ntaken.

    "abstract": "A fluid queuing network constitutes one of the simplest models in which to\nstudy flow dynamics over a network. In this model we have a single source-sink\npair and each link has a per-time-unit capacity and a transit time. A dynamic\nequilibrium (or equilibrium flow over time) is a flow pattern over time such\nthat no flow particle has incentives to unilaterally change its path. Although\nthe model has been around for almost fifty years, only recently results\nregarding existence and characterization of equilibria have been obtained. In\nparticular the long term behavior remains poorly understood. Our main result in\nthis paper is to show that, under a natural (and obviously necessary) condition\non the queuing capacity, a dynamic equilibrium reaches a steady state (after\nwhich queue lengths remain constant) in finite time. Previously, it was not\neven known that queue lengths would remain bounded. The proof is based on the\nanalysis of a rather non-obvious potential function that turns out to be\nmonotone along the evolution of the equilibrium. Furthermore, we show that the\nsteady state is characterized as an optimal solution of a certain linear\nprogram. When this program has a unique solution, which occurs generically, the\nlong term behavior is completely predictable. On the contrary, if the linear\nprogram has multiple solutions the steady state is more difficult to identify\nas it depends on the whole temporal evolution of the equilibrium.",

To deal with the numerous instances of very small scales,\ndifferent from the common solution that divides the high-resolution input image\ninto quite a number of chips with low foreground ratios to perform detection on\nthem each, the Unified Foreground Packing (UFP) module is designed, where the\nsub-regions given by a coarse detector are initially merged through clustering\nto suppress background and the resulting ones are subsequently packed into a\nmosaic for a single inference, thus significantly reducing overall time cost.\nFurthermore, to address the more serious confusion between inter-class\nsimilarities and intra-class variations of instances, which deteriorates\ndetection performance but is rarely discussed, the Multi-Proxy Detection\nNetwork (MP-Det) is presented to model object distributions in a fine-grained\nmanner by employing multiple proxy learning, and the proxies are enforced to be\ndiverse by minimizing a Bag-of-Instance-Words (BoIW) guided optimal transport\nloss. By such means, UFPMP-Det largely promotes both the detection accuracy and\nefficiency.

However, previous\nworks usually address one of two aspects: i) how to extract accurate rationales\nfor explainability while being beneficial to prediction; ii) how to make the\npredictive model robust to different types of adversarial attacks. Intuitively,\na model that produces helpful explanations should be more robust against\nadversarial attacks, because we cannot trust the model that outputs\nexplanations but changes its prediction under small perturbations. To this end,\nwe propose a joint classification and rationale extraction model named AT-BMC.\nIt includes two key mechanisms: mixed Adversarial Training (AT) is designed to\nuse various perturbations in discrete and embedding space to improve the\nmodel's robustness, and Boundary Match Constraint (BMC) helps to locate\nrationales more precisely with the guidance of boundary information.\nPerformances on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed AT-BMC\noutperforms baselines on both classification and rationale extraction by a\nlarge margin. Robustness analysis shows that the proposed AT-BMC decreases the\nattack success rate effectively by up to 69%. The empirical results indicate\nthat there are connections between robust models and better explanations.",

Most\noften in the literature, a simple control structure is chosen, and the control\ngains are tuned empirically based on ground testings. However, due to the large\ndimensions of the balloon and the flight chain, experimental set-ups only\ninvolve the pointing system and the platform, whereas flight experience shows\nthat the pointing performance is essentially limited by the rejection of the\nnatural pendulum-like oscillations of the fully deployed system. This\nobservation justifies the need for a model that predicts such flight conditions\nthat cannot be replicated in laboratory, and for an adequate methodology\naddressing the line-of-sight controller design. In particular, it is necessary\nto ensure robust stability and performance to the parametric uncertainties\ninherent to balloon-borne systems, such as complex balloon's properties or\nrelease of ballast throughout the flight, especially since experimental\nvalidation is limited. In this paper, a dynamical model of the complete system\nis proposed, based on a multibody approach and accounting for parametric\nuncertainties with Linear Fractional Transformations. The comparison with\nflight data shows that the frequency content of the platform's motion is\naccurately predicted.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a safe reinforcement learning algorithm for generation\nbidding decisions and unit maintenance scheduling in a competitive electricity\nmarket environment. In this problem, each unit aims to find a bidding strategy\nthat maximizes its revenue while concurrently retaining its reliability by\nscheduling preventive maintenance. The maintenance scheduling provides some\nsafety constraints which should be satisfied at all times. Satisfying the\ncritical safety and reliability constraints while the generation units have an\nincomplete information of each others' bidding strategy is a challenging\nproblem. Bi-level optimization and reinforcement learning are state of the art\napproaches for solving this type of problems. However, neither bi-level\noptimization nor reinforcement learning can handle the challenges of incomplete\ninformation and critical safety constraints. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose the safe deep deterministic policy gradient reinforcement learning\nalgorithm which is based on a combination of reinforcement learning and a\npredicted safety filter. The case study demonstrates that the proposed approach\ncan achieve a higher profit compared to other state of the art methods while\nconcurrently satisfying the system safety constraints.",

    "abstract": "Native code is now commonplace within Android app packages where it co-exists\nand interacts with Dex bytecode through the Java Native Interface to deliver\nrich app functionalities. Yet, state-of-the-art static analysis approaches have\nmostly overlooked the presence of such native code, which, however, may\nimplement some key sensitive, or even malicious, parts of the app behavior.\nThis limitation of the state of the art is a severe threat to validity in a\nlarge range of static analyses that do not have a complete view of the\nexecutable code in apps. To address this issue, we propose a new advance in the\nambitious research direction of building a unified model of all code in Android\napps. The JuCify approach presented in this paper is a significant step towards\nsuch a model, where we extract and merge call graphs of native code and\nbytecode to make the final model readily-usable by a common Android analysis\nframework: in our implementation, JuCify builds on the Soot internal\nintermediate representation. We performed empirical investigations to highlight\nhow, without the unified model, a significant amount of Java methods called\nfrom the native code are \"unreachable\" in apps' call-graphs, both in goodware\nand malware. Using JuCify, we were able to enable static analyzers to reveal\ncases where malware relied on native code to hide invocation of payment library\ncode or of other sensitive code in the Android framework. Additionally,\nJuCify's model enables state-of-the-art tools to achieve better precision and\nrecall in detecting data leaks through native code. Finally, we show that by\nusing JuCify we can find sensitive data leaks that pass through native code.",

    "abstract": "Batch normalization (BN) is widely used in modern deep neural networks, which\nhas been shown to represent the domain-related knowledge, and thus is\nineffective for cross-domain tasks like unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA).\nExisting BN variant methods aggregate source and target domain knowledge in the\nsame channel in normalization module. However, the misalignment between the\nfeatures of corresponding channels across domains often leads to a sub-optimal\ntransferability. In this paper, we exploit the cross-domain relation and\npropose a novel normalization method, Reciprocal Normalization (RN).\nSpecifically, RN first presents a Reciprocal Compensation (RC) module to\nacquire the compensatory for each channel in both domains based on the\ncross-domain channel-wise correlation. Then RN develops a Reciprocal\nAggregation (RA) module to adaptively aggregate the feature with its\ncross-domain compensatory components. As an alternative to BN, RN is more\nsuitable for UDA problems and can be easily integrated into popular domain\nadaptation methods. Experiments show that the proposed RN outperforms existing\nnormalization counterparts by a large margin and helps state-of-the-art\nadaptation approaches achieve better results.

To overcome all of these disadvantages, we proposed a new deep\nconvolution network architecture with three contributions: (1) using smaller\nconvolution neural networks (CNNs) to compress the model in our improved\nsalient object features compression and reinforcement extraction module\n(ISFCREM) to reduce parameters of the model.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of learning association between face and voice, which is\ngaining interest in the computer vision community lately. Prior works adopt\npairwise or triplet loss formulations to learn an embedding space amenable for\nassociated matching and verification tasks. Albeit showing some progress, such\nloss formulations are, however, restrictive due to dependency on\ndistance-dependent margin parameter, poor run-time training complexity, and\nreliance on carefully crafted negative mining procedures. In this work, we\nhypothesize that enriched feature representation coupled with an effective yet\nefficient supervision is necessary in realizing a discriminative joint\nembedding space for improved face-voice association. To this end, we propose a\nlight-weight, plug-and-play mechanism that exploits the complementary cues in\nboth modalities to form enriched fused embeddings and clusters them based on\ntheir identity labels via orthogonality constraints. We coin our proposed\nmechanism as fusion and orthogonal projection (FOP) and instantiate in a\ntwo-stream pipeline.

The sample efficiency of model-based approaches relies\non whether the model can well approximate the environment. However, learning an\naccurate model is challenging, especially in complex and noisy environments. To\ntackle this problem, we propose the conservative model-based actor-critic\n(CMBAC), a novel approach that achieves high sample efficiency without the\nstrong reliance on accurate learned models. Specifically, CMBAC learns multiple\nestimates of the Q-value function from a set of inaccurate models and uses the\naverage of the bottom-k estimates -- a conservative estimate -- to optimize the\npolicy. An appealing feature of CMBAC is that the conservative estimates\neffectively encourage the agent to avoid unreliable \"promising actions\" --\nwhose values are high in only a small fraction of the models. Experiments\ndemonstrate that CMBAC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in\nterms of sample efficiency on several challenging tasks, and the proposed\nmethod is more robust than previous methods in noisy environments.",

The only requirement for PFNs to work is the ability\nto sample from a prior distribution over supervised learning tasks (or\nfunctions). Our method restates the objective of posterior approximation as a\nsupervised classification problem with a set-valued input: it repeatedly draws\na task (or function) from the prior, draws a set of data points and their\nlabels from it, masks one of the labels and learns to make probabilistic\npredictions for it based on the set-valued input of the rest of the data\npoints. Presented with a set of samples from a new supervised learning task as\ninput, PFNs make probabilistic predictions for arbitrary other data points in a\nsingle forward propagation, having learned to approximate Bayesian inference.\nWe demonstrate that PFNs can near-perfectly mimic Gaussian processes and also\nenable efficient Bayesian inference for intractable problems, with over\n200-fold speedups in multiple setups compared to current methods.

Our core contribution is an axiomatic vocabulary for\nformally defining LCMs, derived from the established axiomatic vocabulary used\nto formalize processor memory consistency models. Using this vocabulary, we\nformalize microarchitectural leakage-focusing on leakage through hardware\nmemory systems-so that it can be automatically detected in programs. To\nillustrate the efficacy of LCMs, we present two case studies.

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning algorithms can perform poorly in real-world tasks\ndue to the discrepancy between source and target environments. This discrepancy\nis commonly viewed as the disturbance in transition dynamics. Many existing\nalgorithms learn robust policies by modeling the disturbance and applying it to\nsource environments during training, which usually requires prior knowledge\nabout the disturbance and control of simulators. However, these algorithms can\nfail in scenarios where the disturbance from target environments is unknown or\nis intractable to model in simulators. To tackle this problem, we propose a\nnovel model-free actor-critic algorithm -- namely, state-conservative policy\noptimization (SCPO) -- to learn robust policies without modeling the\ndisturbance in advance. Specifically, SCPO reduces the disturbance in\ntransition dynamics to that in state space and then approximates it by a simple\ngradient-based regularizer. The appealing features of SCPO include that it is\nsimple to implement and does not require additional knowledge about the\ndisturbance or specially designed simulators. Experiments in several robot\ncontrol tasks demonstrate that SCPO learns robust policies against the\ndisturbance in transition dynamics.",

However, for extreme-edge applications with high uncertainty,\naccess to reduced amounts of data, and where explainable decisions are\nrequired, neural networks may not provide an acceptable form of intelligence.\nBayesian reasoning can solve these concerns, but it is computationally\nexpensive and, unlike neural networks, does not translate naturally to\nmemristor-based architectures. In this work, we introduce, demonstrate\nexperimentally on a fully fabricated hybrid CMOS-memristor system, and analyze\na Bayesian machine designed for highly-energy efficient Bayesian reasoning. The\narchitecture of the machine is obtained by writing Bayes' law in a way making\nits implementation natural by the principles of distributed memory and\nstochastic computing, allowing the circuit to function using solely local\nmemory and minimal data movement. Measurements on a fabricated small-scale\nBayesian machine featuring 2,048 memristors and 30,080 transistors show the\nviability of this approach and the possibility of overcoming the challenges\nassociated with its design: the inherent imperfections of memristors, as well\nas the need to distribute very locally higher-than-nominal supply voltages. The\ndesign of a scaled-up version of the machine shows its outstanding energy\nefficiency on a real-life gesture recognition task: a gesture can be recognized\nusing 5,000 times less energy than using a microcontroller unit. The Bayesian\nmachine also features several desirable features, e.g., instant on/off\noperation, compatibility with low supply voltages, and resilience to\nsingle-event upsets.

    "abstract": "Large-scale graph data in the real-world are often dynamic rather than\nstatic. The data are changing with new nodes, edges, and even classes appearing\nover time, such as in citation networks and research-and-development\ncollaboration networks. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as the\nstandard method for numerous tasks on graph-structured data. In this work, we\nemploy a two-step procedure to explore how GNNs can be incrementally adapted to\nnew unseen graph data. First, we analyze the verge between transductive and\ninductive learning on standard benchmark datasets. After inductive pretraining,\nwe add unlabeled data to the graph and show that the models are stable. Then,\nwe explore the case of continually adding more and more labeled data, while\nconsidering cases, where not all past instances are annotated with class\nlabels. Furthermore, we introduce new classes while the graph evolves and\nexplore methods that automatically detect instances from previously unseen\nclasses. In order to deal with evolving graphs in a principled way, we propose\na lifelong learning framework for graph data along with an evaluation protocol.\nIn this framework, we evaluate representative GNN architectures. We observe\nthat implicit knowledge within model parameters becomes more important when\nexplicit knowledge, i.e., data from past tasks, is limited. We find that in\nopen-world node classification, the data from surprisingly few past tasks are\nsufficient to reach the performance reached by remembering data from all past\ntasks. In the challenging task of unseen class detection, we find that using a\nweighted cross-entropy loss is important for stability.",

Existing\nde-bias learning frameworks try to capture specific dataset bias by bias\nannotations, they fail to handle complicated OOD scenarios. Others implicitly\nidentify the dataset bias by the special design on the low capability biased\nmodel or the loss, but they degrade when the training and testing data are from\nthe same distribution. In this paper, we propose a General Greedy De-bias\nlearning framework (GGD), which greedily trains the biased models and the base\nmodel like gradient descent in functional space. It encourages the base model\nto focus on examples that are hard to solve with biased models, thus remaining\nrobust against spurious correlations in the test stage.

Moreover, latent confounders can lead to false positive\nedges. Relatively few methods have been proposed to address these issues. In\nthis work, we present the hybrid mFGS-BS (majority rule and Fast Greedy\nequivalence Search with Bayesian Scoring) algorithm for structure learning from\ndiscrete data that involves an observational data set and one or more\ninterventional data sets. The algorithm assumes causal insufficiency in the\npresence of latent variables and produces a Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG).\nStructure learning relies on a hybrid approach and a novel Bayesian scoring\nparadigm that calculates the posterior probability of each directed edge being\nadded to the learnt graph.

In swarm robotics applications, where a group of robots need to\ncoordinate in order to achieve their common goals, robot-centric localization\nwill not suffice as each member of the swarm has its own frame of reference.\nOne way to deal with this problem is to create, maintain and share a common map\n(global coordinate system), among the members of the swarm. This paper presents\nan approach to global localization for a group of robots in unknown, GPS and\nlandmark free environments that extends the localization scheme of the LadyBug\nalgorithm. The main idea relies on members of the swarm stay still and act as\nbeacons, emitting electromagnetic signals.

    "abstract": "Suicidal ideation detection from social media is an evolving research with\ngreat challenges. Many of the people who have the tendency to suicide share\ntheir thoughts and opinions through social media platforms. As part of many\nresearches it is observed that the publicly available posts from social media\ncontain valuable criteria to effectively detect individuals with suicidal\nthoughts. The most difficult part to prevent suicide is to detect and\nunderstand the complex risk factors and warning signs that may lead to suicide.\nThis can be achieved by identifying the sudden changes in a user behavior\nautomatically. Natural language processing techniques can be used to collect\nbehavioral and textual features from social media interactions and these\nfeatures can be passed to a specially designed framework to detect anomalies in\nhuman interactions that are indicators of suicidal intentions. We can achieve\nfast detection of suicidal ideation using deep learning and/or machine learning\nbased classification approaches. For such a purpose, we can employ the\ncombination of LSTM and CNN models to detect such emotions from posts of the\nusers. In order to improve the accuracy, some approaches like using more data\nfor training, using attention model to improve the efficiency of existing\nmodels etc. could be done. This paper proposes a LSTM-Attention-CNN combined\nmodel to analyze social media submissions to detect any underlying suicidal\nintentions. During evaluations, the proposed model demonstrated an accuracy of\n90.3 percent and an F1-score of 92.6 percent, which is greater than the\nbaseline models.",

As the services provided by e-commerce\nplatforms become diverse, it is necessary to dynamically adapt the patterns of\ndescriptions generated. The selling point of products is an important type of\nproduct description for which the length should be as short as possible while\nstill conveying key information. In addition, this kind of product description\nshould be eye-catching to the readers. Currently, product selling points are\nnormally written by human experts. Thus, the creation and maintenance of these\ncontents incur high costs. These costs can be significantly reduced if product\nselling points can be automatically generated by machines. In this paper, we\nreport our experience developing and deploying the Intelligent Online Selling\nPoint Extraction (IOSPE) system to serve the recommendation system in the\nJD.com e-commerce platform. Since July 2020, IOSPE has become a core service\nfor 62 key categories of products (covering more than 4 million products). So\nfar, it has generated more than 0.1 billion selling points, thereby\nsignificantly scaling up the selling point creation operation and saving human\nlabour. These IOSPE generated selling points have increased the click-through\nrate (CTR) by 1.89\\% and the average duration the customers spent on the\nproducts by more than 2.03\\% compared to the previous practice, which are\nsignificant improvements for such a large-scale e-commerce platform.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of 5G technology that presents enhanced communication\nreliability and ultra low latency, there is renewed interest in employing cloud\ncomputing to perform high performance but computationally expensive control\nschemes like nonlinear model predictive control (MPC). Such a cloud-based\ncontrol scheme, however, requires data sharing between the plant (agent) and\nthe cloud, which raises privacy concerns. This is because privacy-sensitive\ninformation such as system states and control inputs has to be sent to the\ncloud and thus can be leaked to attackers for various malicious activities. In\nthis paper, we develop a simple yet effective privacy-preserved nonlinear MPC\nframework via affine masking. Specifically, we consider external eavesdroppers\nor honest-but-curious cloud servers that wiretap the communication channel and\nintend to infer the local plant's information including state information,\nsystem dynamics, and control inputs. An affine transformation-based\nprivacy-preservation mechanism is designed to mask the true states and control\nsignals while reformulating the original MPC problem into a different but\nequivalent form. We show that the proposed privacy scheme does not affect the\nMPC performance and it preserves the privacy of the local plant such that the\neavesdropper is unable to find a unique value or even estimate a rough range of\nthe private state and input signals. The proposed method is further extended to\nachieve privacy preservation in cloud-based output-feedback MPC. Simulations\nare performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed approaches.",

In earlier work [4], we described a previous version that\nincrementally injected labels to guide Bounded Model Checking (BMC) and\nEvolutionary Fuzzing engines to produce test cases for code coverage and bug\nfinding. This paper introduces a new version of FuSeBMC that utilizes both\nengines to produce smart seeds.

Then, FuSeBMC runs its engines with more extended\ntime limits using the smart seeds created in the previous round. FuSeBMC\nmanages this process in two main ways using its Tracer subsystem. Firstly, it\nuses shared memory to record the labels covered by each test case. Secondly, it\nevaluates test cases, and those of high impact are turned into seeds for\nsubsequent test fuzzing.

    "abstract": "The increased memory demands of workloads is putting high pressure on Last\nLevel Caches (LLCs). Unfortunately, there is limited opportunity to increase\nthe capacity of LLCs due to the area and power requirements of the underlying\nSRAM technology. Interestingly, emerging Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) technologies\npromise a feasible alternative to SRAM for LLCs due to their higher area\ndensity. However, NVMs have substantially higher read and write latencies,\nwhich offset their area density benefit. Although researchers have proposed\nmethods to tolerate NVM's increased write latency, little emphasis has been\nplaced on reducing the critical NVM read latency.\nTo address this problem, this paper proposes Cloak. Cloak exploits data reuse\nin the LLC at the page level, to hide NVM read latency. Specifically, on\ncertain L1 TLB misses to a page, Cloak transfers LLC-resident data belonging to\nthe page from the LLC NVM array to a set of small SRAM Page Buffers that will\nservice subsequent requests to this page. Further, to enable the\nhigh-bandwidth, low-latency transfer of lines of a page to the page buffers,\nCloak uses an LLC layout that accelerates the discovery of LLC-resident cache\nlines from the page. We evaluate Cloak with full-system simulations of a 4-core\nprocessor across 14 workloads. We find that, on average, Cloak outperforms an\nSRAM LLC by 23.8% and an NVM-only LLC by 8.9% -- in both cases, with negligible\nadditional area. Further, Cloak's ED^2 is 39.9% and 17.5% lower, respectively,\nthan these designs.",

    "title": "REFORM: Reputation Based Fair and Temporal Reward Framework for  Crowdsourcing",
    "abstract": "Crowdsourcing is an effective method to collect data by employing distributed\nhuman population. Researchers introduce appropriate reward mechanisms to\nincentivize agents to report accurately. In particular, this paper focuses on\nPeer-Based Mechanisms (PBMs). We observe that with PBMs, crowdsourcing systems\nmay not be fair, i.e., agents may not receive the deserved rewards despite\ninvesting efforts and reporting truthfully. Unfair rewards for the agents may\ndiscourage participation. This paper aims to build a general framework that\nassures fairness for PBMs in temporal settings, i.e., settings that prefer\nearly reports. Towards this, we introduce two general notions of fairness for\nPBMs, namely gamma-fairness and qualitative fairness. To satisfy these notions,\nour framework provides trustworthy agents with additional chances of pairing.\nWe introduce Temporal Reputation Model (TERM) to quantify agents'\ntrustworthiness across tasks. With TERM as the key constituent, we present our\niterative framework, REFORM, that can adopt the reward scheme of any existing\nPBM. We demonstrate REFORM's significance by deploying the framework with\nRPTSC's reward scheme. Specifically, we prove that REFORM with RPTSC\nconsiderably improves fairness; while incentivizing truthful and early reports.\nWe conduct synthetic simulations and show that our framework provides improved\nfairness over RPTSC.",

    "abstract": "We consider Bayesian inverse problems wherein the unknown state is assumed to\nbe a function with discontinuous structure a priori. A class of prior\ndistributions based on the output of neural networks with heavy-tailed weights\nis introduced, motivated by existing results concerning the infinite-width\nlimit of such networks. We show theoretically that samples from such priors\nhave desirable discontinuous-like properties even when the network width is\nfinite, making them appropriate for edge-preserving inversion. Numerically we\nconsider deconvolution problems defined on one- and two-dimensional spatial\ndomains to illustrate the effectiveness of these priors; MAP estimation,\ndimension-robust MCMC sampling and ensemble-based approximations are utilized\nto probe the posterior distribution. The accuracy of point estimates is shown\nto exceed those obtained from non-heavy tailed priors, and uncertainty\nestimates are shown to provide more useful qualitative information.",

NES optimizes the parameters of a probability\ndistribution based on the estimated natural gradient, and one of the key\nparameters affecting the performance is the learning rate. We argue that from\nthe viewpoint of the natural gradient method, the learning rate should be\ndetermined according to the estimation accuracy of the natural gradient. To do\nso, we propose a new learning rate adaptation mechanism for NES. The proposed\nmechanism makes it possible to set a high learning rate for problems that are\nrelatively easy to optimize, which results in speeding up the search. On the\nother hand, in problems that are difficult to optimize (e.g., multimodal\nfunctions), the proposed mechanism makes it possible to set a conservative\nlearning rate when the estimation accuracy of the natural gradient seems to be\nlow, which results in the robust and stable search. The experimental\nevaluations on unimodal and multimodal functions demonstrate that the proposed\nmechanism works properly depending on a search situation and is effective over\nthe existing method, i.e., using the fixed learning rate.",

The setting is made rigorous by means of the theory of Radon measures\nand of suitable function spaces modeled on $BV$. We prove the lower\nsemicontinuity of the functionals at stake and existence of minimizers for the\ncorresponding variational problems.

We establish existence of optima for the scheme and we\nfinally substantiate its feasibility by numerical examples in image denoising.\nThe cases that we treat are Huber versions of the first and second order total\nvariation with both the Huber and the regularization parameter being spatially\ndependent. Notably the spatially dependent version of second order total\nvariation produces high quality reconstructions when compared to\nregularizations of similar type, and the introduction of the spatially\ndependent Huber parameter leads to a further enhancement of the image details.",

To\ntackle this problem, we propose a novel domain-adaptive degradation network for\nface super-resolution in the wild. This degradation network predicts a flow\nfield along with an intermediate low resolution image. Then, the degraded\ncounterpart is generated by warping the intermediate image. With the preference\nof capturing motion blur, such a model performs better at preserving identity\nconsistency between the original images and the degraded. We further present\nthe self-conditioned block for super-resolution network. This block takes the\ninput image as a condition term to effectively utilize facial structure\ninformation, eliminating the reliance on explicit priors, e.g. facial landmarks\nor boundary.

The one-dimensional reactive transport is\nmodeled at the fine-grained Darcy scale by the actual number of molecules\ninvolved in reactions which undergo advective and diffusive movements described\nby global random walk (GRW) simulations. The CGST averages verify identities\nsimilar to a local scale balance equation which allow us to derive expressions\nfor the flow velocity and the intrinsic diffusion coefficient in terms of\naveraged microscopic quantities. The latter are further used to verify the\nCGST-GRW numerical approach. The upscaling approach is applied to\nbiodegradation processes in saturated aquifers and variably saturated soils and\nthe CGST averages are compared to classical volume averages. One finds that if\nthe process is characterized by slow variations in time, as in homogeneous\nsystems or in case of observations of reactive transport in heterogeneous\naquifers made at large times or far away from the contaminant source, the\ndifferences between the two averages are negligible. Instead, the differences\nare significant if the averages are computed close to the source at early\ntimes, in case of aquifer simulations, and can be extremely large in\nsimulations of biodegradation in soils. In the latter case, the volume average\nis totaly inappropriate as model for experimental measurements, leading, for\ninstance to overestimations by 100% of the CGST average.",

    "abstract": "Learning dynamical systems properties from data provides important insights\nthat help us understand such systems and mitigate undesired outcomes. In this\nwork, we propose a framework for learning spatio-temporal (ST) properties as\nformal logic specifications from data. We introduce SVM-STL, an extension of\nSignal Signal Temporal Logic (STL), capable of specifying spatial and temporal\nproperties of a wide range of dynamical systems that exhibit time-varying\nspatial patterns. Our framework utilizes machine learning techniques to learn\nSVM-STL specifications from system executions given by sequences of spatial\npatterns. We present methods to deal with both labeled and unlabeled data. In\naddition, given system requirements in the form of SVM-STL specifications, we\nprovide an approach for parameter synthesis to find parameters that maximize\nthe satisfaction of such specifications. Our learning framework and parameter\nsynthesis approach are showcased in an example of a reaction-diffusion system.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been an increasing interest in building question\nanswering (QA) models that reason across multiple modalities, such as text and\nimages. However, QA using images is often limited to just picking the answer\nfrom a pre-defined set of options. In addition, images in the real world,\nespecially in news, have objects that are co-referential to the text, with\ncomplementary information from both modalities. In this paper, we present a new\nQA evaluation benchmark with 1,384 questions over news articles that require\ncross-media grounding of objects in images onto text. Specifically, the task\ninvolves multi-hop questions that require reasoning over image-caption pairs to\nidentify the grounded visual object being referred to and then predicting a\nspan from the news body text to answer the question. In addition, we introduce\na novel multimedia data augmentation framework, based on cross-media knowledge\nextraction and synthetic question-answer generation, to automatically augment\ndata that can provide weak supervision for this task. We evaluate both\npipeline-based and end-to-end pretraining-based multimedia QA models on our\nbenchmark, and show that they achieve promising performance, while considerably\nlagging behind human performance hence leaving large room for future work on\nthis challenging new task.",

The\naverage complexity is close to that of successive cancellation (SC) decoding\nfor practical frame error rates (FERs) when applied to polar and Reed-Muller\n(RM) codes with block lengths up to 128. By modifying the algorithm to limit\nthe worst-case complexity, one obtains near-ML performance for longer RM codes\nand their subcodes.

SCOS decoding is further extended by forcing it\nto look for candidates satisfying a threshold, thereby outperforming basic SCOS\ndecoding under complexity constraints.

This paper aims to present an\napproach for the automatic generation of semi-structured representations of\nradiology reports. The approach consists of matching sentences from radiology\nreports to manually created semi-structured representations, followed by\nlearning a sequence-to-sequence neural model that maps matched sentences to\ntheir semi-structured representations. We evaluated the proposed approach on\nthe OpenI corpus of manually annotated chest x-ray radiology reports.

    "abstract": "Making generative models 3D-aware bridges the 2D image space and the 3D\nphysical world yet remains challenging. Recent attempts equip a Generative\nAdversarial Network (GAN) with a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which maps 3D\ncoordinates to pixel values, as a 3D prior. However, the implicit function in\nNeRF has a very local receptive field, making the generator hard to become\naware of the global structure. Meanwhile, NeRF is built on volume rendering\nwhich can be too costly to produce high-resolution results, increasing the\noptimization difficulty. To alleviate these two problems, we propose a novel\nframework, termed as VolumeGAN, for high-fidelity 3D-aware image synthesis,\nthrough explicitly learning a structural representation and a textural\nrepresentation. We first learn a feature volume to represent the underlying\nstructure, which is then converted to a feature field using a NeRF-like model.\nThe feature field is further accumulated into a 2D feature map as the textural\nrepresentation, followed by a neural renderer for appearance synthesis. Such a\ndesign enables independent control of the shape and the appearance.

    "abstract": "Despite the tantalizing success in a broad of vision tasks, transformers have\nnot yet demonstrated on-par ability as ConvNets in high-resolution image\ngenerative modeling. In this paper, we seek to explore using pure transformers\nto build a generative adversarial network for high-resolution image synthesis.\nTo this end, we believe that local attention is crucial to strike the balance\nbetween computational efficiency and modeling capacity. Hence, the proposed\ngenerator adopts Swin transformer in a style-based architecture. To achieve a\nlarger receptive field, we propose double attention which simultaneously\nleverages the context of the local and the shifted windows, leading to improved\ngeneration quality. Moreover, we show that offering the knowledge of the\nabsolute position that has been lost in window-based transformers greatly\nbenefits the generation quality. The proposed StyleSwin is scalable to high\nresolutions, with both the coarse geometry and fine structures benefit from the\nstrong expressivity of transformers. However, blocking artifacts occur during\nhigh-resolution synthesis because performing the local attention in a\nblock-wise manner may break the spatial coherency. To solve this, we\nempirically investigate various solutions, among which we find that employing a\nwavelet discriminator to examine the spectral discrepancy effectively\nsuppresses the artifacts. Extensive experiments show the superiority over prior\ntransformer-based GANs, especially on high resolutions, e.g., 1024x1024. The\nStyleSwin, without complex training strategies, excels over StyleGAN on\nCelebA-HQ 1024, and achieves on-par performance on FFHQ-1024, proving the\npromise of using transformers for high-resolution image generation.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of designing consistent sequential one- and two-sample\ntests in a nonparametric setting. Guided by the principle of \\emph{testing by\nbetting}, we reframe the task of constructing sequential tests into that of\nselecting payoff functions that maximize the wealth of a fictitious bettor,\nbetting against the null in a repeated game. The resulting sequential test\nrejects the null when the bettor's wealth process exceeds an appropriate\nthreshold. We propose a general strategy for selecting payoff functions as\npredictable estimates of the \\emph{witness function} associated with the\nvariational representation of some statistical distance measures, such as\nintegral probability metrics~(IPMs) and $\\varphi$-divergences. Overall, this\napproach ensures that (i) the wealth process is a non-negative martingale under\nthe null, thus allowing tight control over the type-I error, and (ii) it grows\nto infinity almost surely under the alternative, thus implying consistency. We\naccomplish this by designing composite e-processes that remain bounded in\nexpectation under the null, but grow to infinity under the alternative. We\ninstantiate the general test for some common distance metrics to obtain\nsequential versions of Kolmogorov-Smirnov~(KS) test, $\\chi^2$-test and\nkernel-MMD test, and empirically demonstrate their ability to adapt to the\nunknown hardness of the problem. The sequential testing framework constructed\nin this paper is versatile, and we end with a discussion on applying these\nideas to two related problems: testing for higher-order stochastic dominance,\nand testing for symmetry.",

At first, a deep learning algorithm was\ndeveloped using 984 B-scans (from 130 eyes) in order to identify: major\nneural/connective tissues, and ODD regions. The performance of our algorithm\nwas assessed using the Dice coefficient (DC). In a 2nd step, a classification\nalgorithm (random forest) was designed using 150 OCT volumes to perform 3-class\nclassifications (1: ODD, 2: papilledema, 3: healthy) strictly from their drusen\nand prelamina swelling scores (derived from the segmentations). To assess\nperformance, we reported the area under the receiver operating characteristic\ncurves (AUCs) for each class.\nOur segmentation algorithm was able to isolate neural and connective tissues,\nand ODD regions whenever present. This was confirmed by an average DC of\n0.93$\\pm$0.03 on the test set, corresponding to good performance.\nClassification was achieved with high AUCs, i.e. 0.99$\\pm$0.01 for the\ndetection of ODD, 0.99 $\\pm$ 0.01 for the detection of papilledema, and\n0.98$\\pm$0.02 for the detection of healthy ONHs.\nOur AI approach accurately discriminated ODD from papilledema, using a single\nOCT scan.

In this manuscript, we explore\nfederated learning in a multi-domain, multi-task setting wherein different\nparticipating nodes may contain datasets sourced from different domains and are\ntrained to solve different tasks. We evaluated cross-domain federated learning\nfor the tasks of object detection and segmentation across two different\nexperimental settings: multi-modal and multi-organ. The result from our\nexperiments on cross-domain federated learning framework were very encouraging\nwith an overlap similarity of 0.79 for organ localization and 0.65 for lesion\nsegmentation.

One-way functions imply the\nexistence of pseudorandom states, but Kretschmer (TQC'20) recently constructed\nan oracle relative to which there are no one-way functions but pseudorandom\nstates still exist. Motivated by this, we study the intriguing possibility of\nbasing interesting cryptographic tasks on pseudorandom states.\nWe construct, assuming the existence of pseudorandom state generators that\nmap a $\\lambda$-bit seed to a $\\omega(\\log\\lambda)$-qubit state, (a)\nstatistically binding and computationally hiding commitments and (b) pseudo\none-time encryption schemes. A consequence of (a) is that pseudorandom states\nare sufficient to construct maliciously secure multiparty computation protocols\nin the dishonest majority setting.\nOur constructions are derived via a new notion called pseudorandom\nfunction-like states (PRFS), a generalization of pseudorandom states that\nparallels the classical notion of pseudorandom functions. Beyond the above two\napplications, we believe our notion can effectively replace pseudorandom\nfunctions in many other cryptographic applications.",

    "abstract": "Blind image super-resolution(SR) is a long-standing task in CV that aims to\nrestore low-resolution images suffering from unknown and complex distortions.\nRecent work has largely focused on adopting more complicated degradation models\nto emulate real-world degradations. The resulting models have made\nbreakthroughs in perceptual loss and yield perceptually convincing results.\nHowever, the limitation brought by current generative adversarial network\nstructures is still significant: treating pixels equally leads to the ignorance\nof the image's structural features, and results in performance drawbacks such\nas twisted lines and background over-sharpening or blurring. In this paper, we\npresent A-ESRGAN, a GAN model for blind SR tasks featuring an attention U-Net\nbased, multi-scale discriminator that can be seamlessly integrated with other\ngenerators. To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce attention\nU-Net structure as the discriminator of GAN to solve blind SR problems.

Through\ncomparison experiments with prior works, our model presents state-of-the-art\nlevel performance on the non-reference natural image quality evaluator metric.\nAnd our ablation studies have shown that with our discriminator, the RRDB based\ngenerator can leverage the structural features of an image in multiple scales,\nand consequently yields more perceptually realistic high-resolution images\ncompared to prior works.",

    "abstract": "Sequencing technologies are prone to errors, making error correction (EC)\nnecessary for downstream applications. EC tools need to be manually configured\nfor optimal performance. We find that the optimal parameters (e.g., k-mer size)\nare both tool- and dataset-dependent. Moreover, evaluating the performance\n(i.e., Alignment-rate or Gain) of a given tool usually relies on a reference\ngenome, but quality reference genomes are not always available. We introduce\nLerna for the automated configuration of k-mer-based EC tools. Lerna first\ncreates a language model (LM) of the uncorrected genomic reads; then,\ncalculates the perplexity metric to evaluate the corrected reads for different\nparameter choices. Next, it finds the one that produces the highest alignment\nrate without using a reference genome. The fundamental intuition of our\napproach is that the perplexity metric is inversely correlated with the quality\nof the assembly after error correction. Results: First, we show that the best\nk-mer value can vary for different datasets, even for the same EC tool. Second,\nwe show the gains of our LM using its component attention-based transformers.\nWe show the model's estimation of the perplexity metric before and after error\ncorrection. The lower the perplexity after correction, the better the k-mer\nsize. We also show that the alignment rate and assembly quality computed for\nthe corrected reads are strongly negatively correlated with the perplexity,\nenabling the automated selection of k-mer values for better error correction,\nand hence, improved assembly quality. Additionally, we show that our\nattention-based models have significant runtime improvement for the entire\npipeline -- 18X faster than previous works, due to parallelizing the attention\nmechanism and the use of JIT compilation for GPU inferencing.",

    "abstract": "With the AI of Things (AIoT) development, a huge amount of visual data, e.g.,\nimages and videos, are produced in our daily work and life. These visual data\nare not only used for human viewing or understanding but also for machine\nanalysis or decision-making, e.g., intelligent surveillance, automated\nvehicles, and many other smart city applications. To this end, a new image\ncodec paradigm for both human and machine uses is proposed in this work.\nFirstly, the high-level instance segmentation map and the low-level signal\nfeatures are extracted with neural networks. Then, the instance segmentation\nmap is further represented as a profile with the proposed 16-bit gray-scale\nrepresentation. After that, both 16-bit gray-scale profile and signal features\nare encoded with a lossless codec. Meanwhile, an image predictor is designed\nand trained to achieve the general-quality image reconstruction with the 16-bit\ngray-scale profile and signal features. Finally, the residual map between the\noriginal image and the predicted one is compressed with a lossy codec, used for\nhigh-quality image reconstruction. With such designs, on the one hand, we can\nachieve scalable image compression to meet the requirements of different human\nconsumption; on the other hand, we can directly achieve several machine vision\ntasks at the decoder side with the decoded 16-bit gray-scale profile, e.g.,\nobject classification, detection, and segmentation. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed codec achieves comparable results as most learning-based\ncodecs and outperforms the traditional codecs (e.g., BPG and JPEG2000) in terms\nof PSNR and MS-SSIM for image reconstruction. At the same time, it outperforms\nthe existing codecs in terms of the mAP for object detection and segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) models have provided the state-of-the-art performance in a\nwide variety of medical imaging benchmarking challenges, including the Brain\nTumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenges. However, the task of focal pathology\nmulti-compartment segmentation (e.g., tumor and lesion sub-regions) is\nparticularly challenging, and potential errors hinder the translation of DL\nmodels into clinical workflows. Quantifying the reliability of DL model\npredictions in the form of uncertainties, could enable clinical review of the\nmost uncertain regions, thereby building trust and paving the way towards\nclinical translation. Recently, a number of uncertainty estimation methods have\nbeen introduced for DL medical image segmentation tasks. Developing metrics to\nevaluate and compare the performance of uncertainty measures will assist the\nend-user in making more informed decisions. In this study, we explore and\nevaluate a metric developed during the BraTS 2019-2020 task on uncertainty\nquantification (QU-BraTS), and designed to assess and rank uncertainty\nestimates for brain tumor multi-compartment segmentation. This metric (1)\nrewards uncertainty estimates that produce high confidence in correct\nassertions, and those that assign low confidence levels at incorrect\nassertions, and (2) penalizes uncertainty measures that lead to a higher\npercentages of under-confident correct assertions. We further benchmark the\nsegmentation uncertainties generated by 14 independent participating teams of\nQU-BraTS 2020, all of which also participated in the main BraTS segmentation\ntask. Overall, our findings confirm the importance and complementary value that\nuncertainty estimates provide to segmentation algorithms, and hence highlight\nthe need for uncertainty quantification in medical image analyses.

We expected it to enhance\nthe efficiency of interpreting CXRs and reduce the possibilities of delayed\ndiagnosis of lung cancer.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected CXRs from NCKUH database and VBD, an\nopen-source medical image dataset, as our training and validation data. A\nnumber of CXRs from the Ministry of Health and Welfare(MOHW) database served as\nour test data. We built a segmentation model to identify lung areas from CXRs,\nand sliced them into 16 patches. Physicians labeled the CXRs by clicking the\npatches. These labeled patches were then used to train and fine-tune a deep\nneural network(DNN) model, classifying the patches as positive or negative.\nFinally, we test the DNN model with the lung patches of CXRs from MOHW.\nRESULTS: Our segmentation model identified the lung regions well from the\nwhole CXR. The Intersection over Union(IoU) between the ground truth and the\nsegmentation result was 0.9228. In addition, our DNN model achieved a\nsensitivity of 0.81, specificity of 0.82, and AUROC of 0.869 in 98 of 125\ncases.

From an initial random\npopulation of eagles in a given search space, the best eagle is selected and\nundergoes a local food search using the interior point method as its means of\nexploitation. The population is then divided into three subpopulations, and\neach subpopulation is assigned an operator which aids in the exploration. Once\nthe respective operators are applied, the new eagles with improved function\nvalues replace the older ones. The best eagle of the population is then updated\nand conducts a local food search again. These steps are done iteratively, and\nthe food searched by the final best eagle is the optimal solution of the search\nspace. PEOA is tested on 20 optimization test functions with different\nmodality, separability, and dimension properties. The performance of PEOA is\ncompared to 11 other optimization algorithms. To further validate the\neffectiveness of PEOA, it is also applied to image reconstruction in electrical\nimpedance tomography and parameter identification in a neutral delay\ndifferential equation model. Numerical results show that PEOA can obtain\naccurate solutions to various functions and problems.

Considering that the ground-truth intermediate medical slices are\nalways absent in clinical practice, we introduce the incremental cross-view\nmutual distillation strategy to accomplish this task in the self-supervised\nlearning manner.

Under this circumstance, the models learned\nfrom different views can distill valuable knowledge to guide the learning\nprocesses of each other. We can repeat this process to make the models\nsynthesize intermediate slice data with increasing inter-slice resolution.

Existing open corpora could not meet requirements\nfor high-fidelity singing voice synthesis because of the scale and quality\nweaknesses. Previous vocoders have difficulty in multi-singer modeling, and a\ndistinct degradation emerges when conducting unseen singer singing voice\ngeneration. To accelerate singing voice researches in the community, we release\na large-scale, multi-singer Chinese singing voice dataset OpenSinger. To tackle\nthe difficulty in unseen singer modeling, we propose Multi-Singer, a fast\nmulti-singer vocoder with generative adversarial networks. Specifically, 1)\nMulti-Singer uses a multi-band generator to speed up both training and\ninference procedure. 2) to capture and rebuild singer identity from the\nacoustic feature (i.e., mel-spectrogram), Multi-Singer adopts a singer\nconditional discriminator and conditional adversarial training objective. 3) to\nsupervise the reconstruction of singer identity in the spectrum envelopes in\nfrequency domain, we propose an auxiliary singer perceptual loss. The joint\ntraining approach effectively works in GANs for multi-singer voices modeling.\nExperimental results verify the effectiveness of OpenSinger and show that\nMulti-Singer improves unseen singer singing voices modeling in both speed and\nquality over previous methods.

    "abstract": "Due to the irregular shapes,various sizes and indistinguishable boundaries\nbetween the normal and infected tissues, it is still a challenging task to\naccurately segment the infected lesions of COVID-19 on CT images. In this\npaper, a novel segmentation scheme is proposed for the infections of COVID-19\nby enhancing supervised information and fusing multi-scale feature maps of\ndifferent levels based on the encoder-decoder architecture. To this end, a deep\ncollaborative supervision (Co-supervision) scheme is proposed to guide the\nnetwork learning the features of edges and semantics. More specifically, an\nEdge Supervised Module (ESM) is firstly designed to highlight low-level\nboundary features by incorporating the edge supervised information into the\ninitial stage of down-sampling. Meanwhile, an Auxiliary Semantic Supervised\nModule (ASSM) is proposed to strengthen high-level semantic information by\nintegrating mask supervised information into the later stage. Then an Attention\nFusion Module (AFM) is developed to fuse multiple scale feature maps of\ndifferent levels by using an attention mechanism to reduce the semantic gaps\nbetween high-level and low-level feature maps. Finally, the effectiveness of\nthe proposed scheme is demonstrated on four various COVID-19 CT datasets. The\nresults show that the proposed three modules are all promising. Based on the\nbaseline (ResUnet), using ESM, ASSM, or AFM alone can respectively increase\nDice metric by 1.12\\%, 1.95\\%,1.63\\% in our dataset, while the integration by\nincorporating three models together can rise 3.97\\%.

    "abstract": "In recent decades, technological advances have made it possible to collect\nlarge data sets. In this context, the model-based clustering is a very popular,\nflexible and interpretable methodology for data exploration in a well-defined\nstatistical framework. One of the ironies of the increase of large datasets is\nthat missing values are more frequent. However, traditional ways (as discarding\nobservations with missing values or imputation methods) are not designed for\nthe clustering purpose. In addition, they rarely apply to the general case,\nthough frequent in practice, of Missing Not At Random (MNAR) values, i.e. when\nthe missingness depends on the unobserved data values and possibly on the\nobserved data values. The goal of this paper is to propose a novel approach by\nembedding MNAR data directly within model-based clustering algorithms. We\nintroduce a selection model for the joint distribution of data and missing-data\nindicator. It corresponds to a mixture model for the data distribution and a\ngeneral MNAR model for the missing-data mechanism, which may depend on the\nunderlying classes (unknown) and/or the values of the missing variables\nthemselves. A large set of meaningful MNAR sub-models is derived and the\nidentifiability of the parameters is studied for each of the sub-models, which\nis usually a key issue for any MNAR proposals. The EM and Stochastic EM\nalgorithms are considered for estimation. Finally, we perform empirical\nevaluations for the proposed submodels on synthetic data and we illustrate the\nrelevance of our method on a medical register, the TraumaBase (R) dataset.",

    "abstract": "We introduce version 3 of NetKet, the machine learning toolbox for many-body\nquantum physics. NetKet is built around neural-network quantum states and\nprovides efficient algorithms for their evaluation and optimization. This new\nversion is built on top of JAX, a differentiable programming and accelerated\nlinear algebra framework for the Python programming language. The most\nsignificant new feature is the possibility to define arbitrary neural network\nans\\\"atze in pure Python code using the concise notation of machine-learning\nframeworks, which allows for just-in-time compilation as well as the implicit\ngeneration of gradients thanks to automatic differentiation. NetKet 3 also\ncomes with support for GPU and TPU accelerators, advanced support for discrete\nsymmetry groups, chunking to scale up to thousands of degrees of freedom,\ndrivers for quantum dynamics applications, and improved modularity, allowing\nusers to use only parts of the toolbox as a foundation for their own code.",

    "title": "Efficient Floating Point Arithmetic for Quantum Computers",
    "abstract": "One of the major promises of quantum computing is the realization of SIMD\n(single instruction - multiple data) operations using the phenomenon of\nsuperposition. Since the dimension of the state space grows exponentially with\nthe number of qubits, we can easily reach situations where we pay less than a\nsingle quantum gate per data point for data-processing instructions which would\nbe rather expensive in classical computing. Formulating such instructions in\nterms of quantum gates, however, still remains a challenging task. Laying out\nthe foundational functions for more advanced data-processing is therefore a\nsubject of paramount importance for advancing the realm of quantum computing.\nIn this paper, we introduce the formalism of encoding so called-semi-boolean\npolynomials. As it turns out, arithmetic $\\mathbb{Z}/2^n\\mathbb{Z}$ ring\noperations can be formulated as semi-boolean polynomial evaluations, which\nallows convenient generation of unsigned integer arithmetic quantum circuits.\nFor arithmetic evaluations, the resulting algorithm has been known as\nFourier-arithmetic. We extend this type of algorithm with additional features,\nsuch as ancilla-free in-place multiplication and integer coefficient polynomial\nevaluation. Furthermore, we introduce a tailor-made method for encoding signed\nintegers succeeded by an encoding for arbitrary floating-point numbers. This\nrepresentation of floating-point numbers and their processing can be applied to\nany quantum algorithm that performs unsigned modular integer arithmetic. We\ndiscuss some further performance enhancements of the semi boolean polynomial\nencoder and finally supply a complexity estimation. The application of our\nmethods to a 32-bit unsigned integer multiplication demonstrated a 90\\% circuit\ndepth reduction compared to carry-ripple approaches.",

    "title": "Implicit Neural Representation Learning for Hyperspectral Image  Super-Resolution",
    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) super-resolution without additional auxiliary image\nremains a constant challenge due to its high-dimensional spectral patterns,\nwhere learning an effective spatial and spectral representation is a\nfundamental issue. Recently, Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are making\nstrides as a novel and effective representation, especially in the\nreconstruction task. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel HSI\nreconstruction model based on INR which represents HSI by a continuous function\nmapping a spatial coordinate to its corresponding spectral radiance values. In\nparticular, as a specific implementation of INR, the parameters of parametric\nmodel are predicted by a hypernetwork that operates on feature extraction using\nconvolution network. It makes the continuous functions map the spatial\ncoordinates to pixel values in a content-aware manner. Moreover, periodic\nspatial encoding are deeply integrated with the reconstruction procedure, which\nmakes our model capable of recovering more high frequency details. To verify\nthe efficacy of our model, we conduct experiments on three HSI datasets (CAVE,\nNUS, and NTIRE2018). Experimental results show that the proposed model can\nachieve competitive reconstruction performance in comparison with the\nstate-of-the-art methods. In addition, we provide an ablation study on the\neffect of individual components of our model. We hope this paper could server\nas a potent reference for future research.",

    "abstract": "Polyadic (one-to-many) social interaction happens when one sender addresses\nmultiple receivers simultaneously. Currently available relational event models\n(REM) are not well suited to the analysis of polyadic interaction networks\nbecause they specify event rates for sets of receivers as functions of dyadic\ncovariates associated with the sender and one receiver at a time. Relational\nhyperevent models (RHEM) alleviate this problem by specifying event rates as\nfunctions of hyperedge covariates associated with the sender and the entire set\nof receivers. In this article we demonstrate the potential benefits of RHEMs\nfor the analysis of polyadic social interaction. We define and implement\npractically relevant effects that are not available for REMs but may be\nincorporated in empirical specifications of RHEM. In a reanalysis of the\ncanonical Enron email data, we illustrate how RHEMs effectively (i) reveal\nevidence of polyadic dependencies in empirical data, (ii) improve the fit over\ncomparable dyadic specifications of REMs, and (iii) better identify the set of\nrecipients actually receiving the same email message from sets of potential\nrecipients who could have received the same email message, but did not.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of 3D medical images is a challenging task due to the\nhigh variability of the shape and pattern of objects (such as organs or\ntumors). Given the recent success of deep learning in medical image\nsegmentation, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been introduced to find\nhigh-performance 3D segmentation network architectures. However, because of the\nmassive computational requirements of 3D data and the discrete optimization\nnature of architecture search, previous NAS methods require a long search time\nor necessary continuous relaxation, and commonly lead to sub-optimal network\narchitectures. While one-shot NAS can potentially address these disadvantages,\nits application in the segmentation domain has not been well studied in the\nexpansive multi-scale multi-path search space. To enable one-shot NAS for\nmedical image segmentation, our method, named HyperSegNAS, introduces a\nHyperNet to assist super-net training by incorporating architecture topology\ninformation. Such a HyperNet can be removed once the super-net is trained and\nintroduces no overhead during architecture search. We show that HyperSegNAS\nyields better performing and more intuitive architectures compared to the\nprevious state-of-the-art (SOTA) segmentation networks; furthermore, it can\nquickly and accurately find good architecture candidates under different\ncomputing constraints. Our method is evaluated on public datasets from the\nMedical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, and achieves SOTA performances.",

First, we provide\nalgebraic tools for studying classes of languages known as super-AFLs, which\ngeneralise e.g. the context-free or the indexed languages. When $\\mathcal{C}$\nis a super-AFL closed under reversal, we prove that the semigroup (monoid) free\nproduct of two semigroups (resp. monoids) with word problem in $\\mathcal{C}$\nalso has word problem in $\\mathcal{C}$. This recovers and generalises a recent\nresult by Brough, Cain & Pfeiffer that the class of context-free semigroups\n(monoids) is closed under taking free products. As a group-theoretic corollary,\nwe deduce that the word problem of the (group) free product of two groups with\nword problem in $\\mathcal{C}$ is also in $\\mathcal{C}$. As a particular case,\nwe find that the free product of two groups with indexed word problem has\nindexed word problem.",

    "abstract": "All physical laws are described as relationships between state variables that\ngive a complete and non-redundant description of the relevant system dynamics.\nHowever, despite the prevalence of computing power and AI, the process of\nidentifying the hidden state variables themselves has resisted automation. Most\ndata-driven methods for modeling physical phenomena still assume that observed\ndata streams already correspond to relevant state variables. A key challenge is\nto identify the possible sets of state variables from scratch, given only\nhigh-dimensional observational data. Here we propose a new principle for\ndetermining how many state variables an observed system is likely to have, and\nwhat these variables might be, directly from video streams. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this approach using video recordings of a variety of physical\ndynamical systems, ranging from elastic double pendulums to fire flames.\nWithout any prior knowledge of the underlying physics, our algorithm discovers\nthe intrinsic dimension of the observed dynamics and identifies candidate sets\nof state variables.
