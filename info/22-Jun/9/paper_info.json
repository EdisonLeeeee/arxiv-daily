As an anthropomorphic research area, it includes Brain Principles\nProgramming (BPP) -- the formalization of universal mechanisms (principles) of\nthe brain work with information, which are implemented at all levels of the\norganization of nervous tissue. This monograph contains a formalization of\nthese principles in terms of category theory. However, this formalization is\nnot enough to develop algorithms for working with information. In this paper,\nfor the description and modeling of BPP, it is proposed to apply mathematical\nmodels and algorithms developed earlier, which modeling cognitive functions and\nbase on well-known physiological, psychological and other natural science\ntheories. The paper uses mathematical models and algorithms of the following\ntheories: P.K.Anokhin Theory of Functional Brain Systems, Eleanor Rosch\nprototypical categorization theory, Bob Rehder theory of causal models and\n\"natural\" classification. As a result, a formalization of BPP is obtained and\ncomputer experiments demonstrating the operation of algorithms are presented.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus our attention on private Empirical Risk Minimization\n(ERM), which is one of the most commonly used data analysis method. We take the\nfirst step towards solving the above problem by theoretically exploring the\neffect of epsilon (the parameter of differential privacy that determines the\nstrength of privacy guarantee) on utility of the learning model. We trace the\nchange of utility with modification of epsilon and reveal an established\nrelationship between epsilon and utility. We then formalize this relationship\nand propose a practical approach for estimating the utility under an arbitrary\nvalue of epsilon. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results\ndemonstrate high estimation accuracy and broad applicability of our approach in\npractical applications. As providing algorithms with strong utility guarantees\nthat also give privacy when possible becomes more and more accepted, our\napproach would have high practical value and may be likely to be adopted by\ncompanies and organizations that would like to preserve privacy but are\nunwilling to compromise on utility.",

    "abstract": "Explaining is a human knowledge transfer process regarding a phenomenon\nbetween an explainer and an explainee. Each word used to explain this\nphenomenon must be carefully selected by the explainer in accordance with the\ncurrent explainee phenomenon-related knowledge level and the phenomenon itself\nin order to have a high understanding from the explainee of the phenomenon.\nNowadays, deep models, especially graph neural networks, have a major place in\ndaily life even in critical applications. In such context, those models need to\nhave a human high interpretability also referred as being explainable, in order\nto improve usage trustability of them in sensitive cases. Explaining is also a\nhuman dependent task and methods that explain deep model behavior must include\nthese social-related concerns for providing profitable and quality\nexplanations. Current explaining methods often occlude such social aspect for\nproviding their explanations and only focus on the signal aspect of the\nquestion. In this contribution we propose a reliable social-aware explaining\nmethod suited for graph neural network that includes this social feature as a\nmodular concept generator and by both leveraging signal and graph domain aspect\nthanks to an eigencentrality concept ordering approach.

    "abstract": "Currently, the federated graph neural network (GNN) has attracted a lot of\nattention due to its wide applications in reality without violating the privacy\nregulations. Among all the privacy-preserving technologies, the differential\nprivacy (DP) is the most promising one due to its effectiveness and light\ncomputational overhead. However, the DP-based federated GNN has not been well\ninvestigated, especially in the sub-graph-level setting, such as the scenario\nof recommendation system. The biggest challenge is how to guarantee the privacy\nand solve the non independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data in\nfederated GNN simultaneously. In this paper, we propose DP-FedRec, a DP-based\nfederated GNN to fill the gap. Private Set Intersection (PSI) is leveraged to\nextend the local graph for each client, and thus solve the non-IID problem.\nMost importantly, DP is applied not only on the weights but also on the edges\nof the intersection graph from PSI to fully protect the privacy of clients. The\nevaluation demonstrates DP-FedRec achieves better performance with the graph\nextension and DP only introduces little computations overhead.",

A method for incorporating the\nproposed cyber-metric into operational decisions is also proposed by\nformulating a cyber-constrained AC optimal power flow (C-ACOPF) that considers\nthe status of all the CPES layers.

In this paper, we propose a\nselfsupervised approach for natural movie reconstruction.

These enable\nincreasing the applicable training data by several orders of magnitude,\nintroducing natural video priors to the decoding network, as well as temporal\ncoherence. Our approach signifcantly outperforms competing methods, since those\ntrain only on the limited supervised data. We further introduce a new and\nsimple temporal prior of natural videos, which when folded into our fMRI\ndecoder further allows us to reconstruct videos at a higher framerate (HFR) of\nup to x8 of the original fMRI sample rate.",

However, a concept of\ngeneration of compounds with specific properties and simultaneous modeling of\ntheir efficacy against cancer cell lines has not been comprehensively explored.\nTo address this need, we present VADEERS, a Variational Autoencoder-based Drug\nEfficacy Estimation Recommender System. The generation of compounds is\nperformed by a novel variational autoencoder with a semi-supervised Gaussian\nMixture Model (GMM) prior. The prior defines a clustering in the latent space,\nwhere the clusters are associated with specific drug properties. In addition,\nVADEERS is equipped with a cell line autoencoder and a sensitivity prediction\nnetwork. The model combines data for SMILES string representations of\nanti-cancer drugs, their inhibition profiles against a panel of protein\nkinases, cell lines biological features and measurements of the sensitivity of\nthe cell lines to the drugs. The evaluated variants of VADEERS achieve a high\nr=0.87 Pearson correlation between true and predicted drug sensitivity\nestimates. We train the GMM prior in such a way that the clusters in the latent\nspace correspond to a pre-computed clustering of the drugs by their inhibitory\nprofiles. We show that the learned latent representations and new generated\ndata points accurately reflect the given clustering. In summary, VADEERS offers\na comprehensive model of drugs and cell lines properties and relationships\nbetween them, as well as a guided generation of novel compounds.",

    "abstract": "Relatively little is known about mobile phone use in a Supply Chain\nManagement (SCM) context, especially in the Bangladeshi Ready-Made Garment\n(RMG) industry. RMG is a very important industry for the Bangladeshi economy\nbut is criticized for long product supply times due to poor SCM. RMG requires\nobtaining real-time information and enhanced dynamic control, through utilizing\ninformation sharing and connecting stakeholders in garment manufacturing.\nHowever, a lack of IT support in the Bangladeshi RMG sector, the high price of\ncomputers and the low level of adoption of the computer-based internet are\nobstacles to providing sophisticated computer-aided SCM. Alternatively, the\nexplosive adoption of mobile phones and continuous improvement of this\ntechnology is an opportunity to provide mobile-based SCM for the RMG sector.\nThis research presents a mobile phone-based SCM framework for the Bangladeshi\nRMG sector. The proposed framework shows that mobile phone-based SCM can\npositively impact communication, information exchange, information retrieval\nand flow, coordination and management, which represent the main processes of\neffective SCM. However, to capitalize on these benefits, it is also important\nto discover the critical success factors and barriers to mobile SCM systems.",

Moreover, it is crucial to robustly ensure safety\nwithout inducing unnecessary conservativeness that degrades performance. In\nthis work we present a constructive approach for safety-critical control\nsynthesis via Control Barrier Functions (CBF). By filtering a hand-designed\ncontroller via a CBF, we are able to attain performant behavior while providing\nrigorous guarantees of safety. In the face of disturbances, robust safety and\nperformance are simultaneously achieved through the notion of Input-to-State\nSafety (ISSf).

To establish the\ncapability of the proposed approach, we consider the practical setting of\nsafety-critical design via CBFs for a connected automated vehicle (CAV) in the\nform of a class-8 truck without a trailer. Through experimentation we see the\nimpact of unmodeled disturbances in the truck's actuation system on the safety\nguarantees provided by CBFs. We characterize these disturbances and using ISSf,\nproduce a robust controller that achieves safety without conceding performance.\nWe evaluate our design both in simulation, and for the first time on an\nautomotive system, experimentally.",

    "abstract": "A mobile robot's precise location information is critical for navigation and\ntask processing, especially for a multi-robot system (MRS) to collaborate and\ncollect valuable data from the field. However, a robot in situations where it\ndoes not have access to GPS signals, such as in an environmentally controlled,\nindoor, or underground environment, finds it difficult to locate using its\nsensor alone. As a result, robots sharing their local information to improve\ntheir localization estimates benefit the entire MRS team. There have been\nseveral attempts to model-based multi-robot localization using Radio Signal\nStrength Indicator (RSSI) as a source to calculate bearing information. We also\nutilize the RSSI for wireless networks generated through the communication of\nmultiple robots in a system and aim to localize agents with high accuracy and\nefficiency in a dynamic environment for shared information fusion to refine the\nlocalization estimation. This estimator structure reduces one source of\nmeasurement correlation while appropriately incorporating others. This paper\nproposes a decentralized Multi-robot Synergistic Localization System (MRSL) for\na dense and dynamic environment. Robots update their position estimation\nwhenever new information receives from their neighbors. When the system senses\nthe presence of other robots in the region, it exchanges position estimates and\nmerges the received data to improve its localization accuracy. Our approach\nuses Bayesian rule-based integration, which has shown to be computationally\nefficient and applicable to asynchronous robotics communication. We have\nperformed extensive simulation experiments with a varying number of robots to\nanalyze the algorithm.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks for image classification are well-known to be vulnerable\nto adversarial attacks. One such attack that has garnered recent attention is\nthe adversarial backdoor attack, which has demonstrated the capability to\nperform targeted misclassification of specific examples. In particular,\nbackdoor attacks attempt to force a model to learn spurious relations between\nbackdoor trigger patterns and false labels. In response to this threat,\nnumerous defensive measures have been proposed; however, defenses against\nbackdoor attacks focus on backdoor pattern detection, which may be unreliable\nagainst novel or unexpected types of backdoor pattern designs. We introduce a\nnovel re-contextualization of the adversarial setting, where the presence of an\nadversary implicitly admits the existence of multiple database contributors.\nThen, under the mild assumption of contributor awareness, it becomes possible\nto exploit this knowledge to defend against backdoor attacks by destroying the\nfalse label associations. We propose a contributor-aware universal defensive\nframework for learning in the presence of multiple, potentially adversarial\ndata sources that utilizes semi-supervised ensembles and learning from crowds\nto filter the false labels produced by adversarial triggers. Importantly, this\ndefensive strategy is agnostic to backdoor pattern design, as it functions\nwithout needing -- or even attempting -- to perform either adversary\nidentification or backdoor pattern detection during either training or\ninference. Our empirical studies demonstrate the robustness of the proposed\nframework against adversarial backdoor attacks from multiple simultaneous\nadversaries.",

Furthermore, we extend and\nanalyze our approach to bidirectional communication compression and partial\ndevice participation setups to cater to the practical considerations of\napplications in federated learning. For all our methods, we derive fast\ncondition-number-independent local linear and/or superlinear convergence rates.\nFinally, with extensive numerical evaluations on convex optimization problems,\nwe illustrate that our designed schemes achieve state-of-the-art communication\ncomplexity compared to several key baselines using second-order information.",

Existing\nself-supervised learning methods typically assume the graph is homophilous\nwhere linked nodes often belong to the same class or have similar features.\nHowever, such assumptions of homophily do not always hold true in real-world\ngraphs. We address this problem by developing a decoupled self-supervised\nlearning (DSSL) framework for graph neural networks. DSSL imitates a generative\nprocess of nodes and links from latent variable modeling of the semantic\nstructure, which decouples different underlying semantics between different\nneighborhoods into the self-supervised node learning process. Our DSSL\nframework is agnostic to the encoders and does not need prefabricated\naugmentations, thus is flexible to different graphs. To effectively optimize\nthe framework with latent variables, we derive the evidence lower-bound of the\nself-supervised objective and develop a scalable training algorithm with\nvariational inference. We provide a theoretical analysis to justify that DSSL\nenjoys better downstream performance.

However, their adoption in practice remains restricted due to (i)\nnon-scalability on accelerated deep learning hardware, (ii) vanishing gradients\ndue to the closure of hyperbolic space, and (iii) information loss due to\nfrequent mapping between local tangent space and fully hyperbolic space. To\ntackle these issues, we propose the approximation of hyperbolic operators using\nTaylor series expansions, which allows us to reformulate the computationally\nexpensive tangent and cosine hyperbolic functions into their polynomial\nequivariants which are more efficient. This allows us to retain the benefits of\npreserving the hierarchical anatomy of the hyperbolic space, while maintaining\nthe scalability over current accelerated deep learning infrastructure. The\npolynomial formulation also enables us to utilize the advancements in Euclidean\nnetworks such as gradient clipping and ReLU activation to avoid vanishing\ngradients and remove errors due to frequent switching between tangent space and\nhyperbolic space. Our empirical evaluation on standard benchmarks in the domain\nof graph analysis and computer vision shows that our polynomial formulation is\nas scalable as Euclidean architectures, both in terms of memory and time\ncomplexity, while providing results as effective as hyperbolic models.\nMoreover, our formulation also shows a considerable improvement over its\nbaselines due to our solution to vanishing gradients and information loss.",

However, studies have shown critical\nissues of ML discrimination and unfairness, which hinder their adoption on\nhigh-stake applications. Recent research on fair classifiers has drawn\nsignificant attention to develop effective algorithms to achieve fairness and\ngood classification performance. Despite the great success of these\nfairness-aware machine learning models, most of the existing models require\nsensitive attributes to preprocess the data, regularize the model learning or\npostprocess the prediction to have fair predictions. However, sensitive\nattributes are often incomplete or even unavailable due to privacy, legal or\nregulation restrictions. Though we lack the sensitive attribute for training a\nfair model in the target domain, there might exist a similar domain that has\nsensitive attributes. Thus, it is important to exploit auxiliary information\nfrom the similar domain to help improve fair classification in the target\ndomain. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of exploring domain\nadaptation for fair classification.

To this end, we first draw two\nobservations: (1) The guideline of devising pre-training tasks is imitating the\nrepresentation of the target task.

Afterwards, following the\nguideline, we propose several strategies to further improve this baseline,\nwhich mainly include target guided semi-dense depth estimation, keypoint-aware\n2D object detection, and class-level loss adjustment. Combining all the\ndeveloped techniques, the obtained pre-training framework produces pre-trained\nbackbones that improve M3OD performance significantly on both the KITTI-3D and\nnuScenes benchmarks.

This application necessitates efficient inquiry of relevant\ndisease symptoms in order to make accurate diagnosis recommendations. This can\nbe formulated as a problem of sequential feature (symptom) selection and\nclassification for which reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been\nproposed as a natural solution. They perform well when the feature space is\nsmall, that is, the number of symptoms and diagnosable disease categories is\nlimited, but they frequently fail in assignments with a large number of\nfeatures. To address this challenge, we propose a Multi-Model-Fused\nActor-Critic (MMF-AC) RL framework that consists of a generative actor network\nand a diagnostic critic network. The actor incorporates a Variational\nAutoEncoder (VAE) to model the uncertainty induced by partial observations of\nfeatures, thereby facilitating in making appropriate inquiries. In the critic\nnetwork, a supervised diagnosis model for disease predictions is involved to\nprecisely estimate the state-value function. Furthermore, inspired by the\nmedical concept of differential diagnosis, we combine the generative and\ndiagnosis models to create a novel reward shaping mechanism to address the\nsparse reward problem in large search spaces. We conduct extensive experiments\non both synthetic and real-world datasets for empirical evaluations. The\nresults demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\nterms of diagnostic accuracy and interaction efficiency while also being more\neffectively scalable to large search spaces.

The goal of this paper is to\nstandardize the inconsistent experimental settings and propose a consistent\nmodel parameter selection criterion for debiasing. Based on such unified\nexperimental settings and model parameter selection criterion, we build a\nbenchmark named DebiasBench which includes five datasets and seven debiasing\nmethods. We carefully conduct extensive experiments in various aspects and show\nthat different state-of-the-art methods work best in different datasets,\nrespectively. Even, the vanilla method, the method with no debiasing module,\nalso shows competitive results in datasets with low bias severity. We publicly\nrelease the implementation of existing debiasing methods in DebiasBench to\nencourage future researchers in debiasing to conduct fair comparisons and\nfurther push the state-of-the-art performances.",

In this work, we\npresent UniAD that accomplishes anomaly detection for multiple classes with a\nunified framework. Under such a challenging setting, popular reconstruction\nnetworks may fall into an \"identical shortcut\", where both normal and anomalous\nsamples can be well recovered, and hence fail to spot outliers. To tackle this\nobstacle, we make three improvements. First, we revisit the formulations of\nfully-connected layer, convolutional layer, as well as attention layer, and\nconfirm the important role of query embedding (i.e., within attention layer) in\npreventing the network from learning the shortcut. We therefore come up with a\nlayer-wise query decoder to help model the multi-class distribution. Second, we\nemploy a neighbor masked attention module to further avoid the information leak\nfrom the input feature to the reconstructed output feature. Third, we propose a\nfeature jittering strategy that urges the model to recover the correct message\neven with noisy inputs. We evaluate our algorithm on MVTec-AD and CIFAR-10\ndatasets, where we surpass the state-of-the-art alternatives by a sufficiently\nlarge margin.

    "abstract": "A recent goal in the theory of deep learning is to identify how neural\nnetworks can escape the \"lazy training,\" or Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime,\nwhere the network is coupled with its first order Taylor expansion at\ninitialization. While the NTK is minimax optimal for learning dense polynomials\n(Ghorbani et al, 2021), it cannot learn features, and hence has poor sample\ncomplexity for learning many classes of functions including sparse polynomials.\nRecent works have thus aimed to identify settings where gradient based\nalgorithms provably generalize better than the NTK. One such example is the\n\"QuadNTK\" approach of Bai and Lee (2020), which analyzes the second-order term\nin the Taylor expansion. Bai and Lee (2020) show that the second-order term can\nlearn sparse polynomials efficiently; however, it sacrifices the ability to\nlearn general dense polynomials.\nIn this paper, we analyze how gradient descent on a two-layer neural network\ncan escape the NTK regime by utilizing a spectral characterization of the NTK\n(Montanari and Zhong, 2020) and building on the QuadNTK approach. We first\nexpand upon the spectral analysis to identify \"good\" directions in parameter\nspace in which we can move without harming generalization. Next, we show that a\nwide two-layer neural network can jointly use the NTK and QuadNTK to fit target\nfunctions consisting of a dense low-degree term and a sparse high-degree term\n-- something neither the NTK nor the QuadNTK can do on their own. Finally, we\nconstruct a regularizer which encourages our parameter vector to move in the\n\"good\" directions, and show that gradient descent on the regularized loss will\nconverge to a global minimizer, which also has low test error. This yields an\nend to end convergence and generalization guarantee with provable sample\ncomplexity improvement over both the NTK and QuadNTK on their own.",

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning-based image denoising methods have achieved promising\nperformance on test data with the same distribution as training set, where\nvarious denoising models based on synthetic or collected real-world training\ndata have been learned. However, when handling real-world noisy images, the\ndenoising performance is still limited. In this paper, we propose a simple yet\neffective Bayesian deep ensemble (BDE) method for real-world image denoising,\nwhere several representative deep denoisers pre-trained with various training\ndata settings can be fused to improve robustness. The foundation of BDE is that\nreal-world image noises are highly signal-dependent, and heterogeneous noises\nin a real-world noisy image can be separately handled by different denoisers.\nIn particular, we take well-trained CBDNet, NBNet, HINet, Uformer and GMSNet\ninto denoiser pool, and a U-Net is adopted to predict pixel-wise weighting maps\nto fuse these denoisers. Instead of solely learning pixel-wise weighting maps,\nBayesian deep learning strategy is introduced to predict weighting uncertainty\nas well as weighting map, by which prediction variance can be modeled for\nimproving robustness on real-world noisy images. Extensive experiments have\nshown that real-world noises can be better removed by fusing existing denoisers\ninstead of training a big denoiser with expensive cost. On DND dataset, our BDE\nachieves +0.28~dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art denoising method.\nMoreover, we note that our BDE denoiser based on different Gaussian noise\nlevels outperforms state-of-the-art CBDNet when applying to real-world noisy\nimages. Furthermore, our BDE can be extended to other image restoration tasks,\nand achieves +0.30dB, +0.18dB and +0.12dB PSNR gains on benchmark datasets for\nimage deblurring, image deraining and single image super-resolution,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "Even though auto-encoders (AEs) have the desirable property of learning\ncompact representations without labels and have been widely applied to\nout-of-distribution (OoD) detection, they are generally still poorly understood\nand are used incorrectly in detecting outliers where the normal and abnormal\ndistributions are strongly overlapping. In general, the learned manifold is\nassumed to contain key information that is only important for describing\nsamples within the training distribution, and that the reconstruction of\noutliers leads to high residual errors. However, recent work suggests that AEs\nare likely to be even better at reconstructing some types of OoD samples. In\nthis work, we challenge this assumption and investigate what auto-encoders\nactually learn when they are posed to solve two different tasks. First, we\npropose two metrics based on the Fr\\'echet inception distance (FID) and\nconfidence scores of a trained classifier to assess whether AEs can learn the\ntraining distribution and reliably recognize samples from other domains.\nSecond, we investigate whether AEs are able to synthesize normal images from\nsamples with abnormal regions, on a more challenging lung pathology detection\ntask. We have found that state-of-the-art (SOTA) AEs are either unable to\nconstrain the latent manifold and allow reconstruction of abnormal patterns, or\nthey are failing to accurately restore the inputs from their latent\ndistribution, resulting in blurred or misaligned reconstructions.

To overcome the difficulty arose from dealing with the\nexponential-sized ground set of rules, the subproblem of searching a rule is\ncasted as another subset selection task that asks for a subset of features. We\nshow it is possible to write the induced objective function for the subproblem\nas a difference of two submodular (DS) functions to make it approximately\nsolvable by DS optimization algorithms. Overall, the proposed approach is\nsimple, scalable, and likely to be benefited from further research on\nsubmodular optimization. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method.",

However, with the emergence of deep models pre-trained from\ndifferent resources, model hubs consisting of diverse models with various\narchitectures, pre-trained datasets and learning paradigms are available.\nDirectly applying single-model transfer learning methods to each model wastes\nthe abundant knowledge of the model hub and suffers from high computational\ncost. In this paper, we propose a Hub-Pathway framework to enable knowledge\ntransfer from a model hub. The framework generates data-dependent pathway\nweights, based on which we assign the pathway routes at the input level to\ndecide which pre-trained models are activated and passed through, and then set\nthe pathway aggregation at the output level to aggregate the knowledge from\ndifferent models to make predictions.

We utilize a noisy pathway generator and design an\nexploration loss to further explore different pathways throughout the model\nhub.

Many regularization methods have been\nproven to be effective with the combination of adversarial training.\nNevertheless, such regularization methods are implemented in the time domain.\nSince adversarial vulnerability can be regarded as a high-frequency phenomenon,\nit is essential to regulate the adversarially-trained neural network models in\nthe frequency domain. Faced with these challenges, we make a theoretical\nanalysis on the regularization property of wavelets which can enhance\nadversarial training. We propose a wavelet regularization method based on the\nHaar wavelet decomposition which is named Wavelet Average Pooling.

    "abstract": "A motif intuitively is a short time series that repeats itself approximately\nthe same within a larger time series. Such motifs often represent concealed\nstructures, such as heart beats in an ECG recording, or sleep spindles in EEG\nsleep data. Motif discovery (MD) is the task of finding such motifs in a given\ninput series. As there are varying definitions of what exactly a motif is, a\nnumber of algorithms exist. As central parameters they all take the length l of\nthe motif and the maximal distance r between the motif's occurrences. In\npractice, however, suitable values for r are very hard to determine upfront,\nand the found motifs show a high variability. Setting the wrong input value\nwill result in a motif that is not distinguishable from noise. Accordingly,\nfinding an interesting motif with these methods requires extensive\ntrial-and-error. We present a different approach to the MD problem. We define\nk-Motiflets as the set of exactly k occurrences of a motif of length l, whose\nmaximum pairwise distance is minimal. This turns the MD problem upside-down:\nOur central parameter is not the distance threshold r, but the desired size k\nof a motif set, which we show is considerably more intuitive and easier to set.\nBased on this definition, we present exact and approximate algorithms for\nfinding k-Motiflets and analyze their complexity. To further ease the use of\nour method, we describe extensions to automatically determine the\nright/suitable values for its input parameters. Thus, for the first time,\nextracting meaningful motif sets without any a-priori knowledge becomes\nfeasible. By evaluating real-world use cases and comparison to 4\nstate-of-the-art MD algorithms, we show that our proposed algorithm is (a)\nquantitatively superior, finding larger motif sets at higher similarity, (b)\nqualitatively better, leading to clearer and easier to interpret motifs, and\n(c) has the lowest runtime.",

Balancing waiting times of patients\nto be first seen by a physician with the overall length of stay over all acuity\nlevels is crucial to maintain an acceptable level of operational performance\nfor all patients. To address those requirements when assigning idle resources\nto patients, several methods have been proposed in the past, including the\nAccumulated Priority Queuing (APQ) method. The APQ method linearly assigns\npriority scores to patients with respect to their time in the system and acuity\nlevel. Hence, selection decisions are based on a simple system representation\nthat is used as an input for a selection function. This paper investigates the\npotential of an Machine Learning (ML) based patient selection method. It\nassumes that for a large set of training data, including a multitude of\ndifferent system states, (near) optimal assignments can be computed by a\n(heuristic) optimizer, with respect to a chosen performance metric, and aims to\nimitate such optimal behavior when applied to new situations. Thereby, it\nincorporates a comprehensive state representation of the system and a complex\nnon-linear selection function. The motivation for the proposed approach is that\nhigh quality selection decisions may depend on a variety of factors describing\nthe current state of the ED, not limited to waiting times, which can be\ncaptured and utilized by the ML model.

However, due to the large number of antennas, the conventional channel\nestimation and hybrid beamforming algorithms generally require high\ncomputational complexity and signaling overhead. In this work, we propose an\nend-to-end deep-unfolding neural network (NN) joint channel estimation and\nhybrid beamforming (JCEHB) algorithm to maximize the system sum rate in\ntime-division duplex (TDD) massive MIMO. Specifically, the recursive\nleast-squares (RLS) algorithm and stochastic successive convex approximation\n(SSCA) algorithm are unfolded for channel estimation and hybrid beamforming,\nrespectively. In order to reduce the signaling overhead, we consider a\nmixed-timescale hybrid beamforming scheme, where the analog beamforming\nmatrices are optimized based on the channel state information (CSI) statistics\noffline, while the digital beamforming matrices are designed at each time slot\nbased on the estimated low-dimensional equivalent CSI matrices.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are an essential tool to relieve the information overload\nchallenge and play an important role in people's daily lives. Since\nrecommendations involve allocations of social resources (e.g., job\nrecommendation), an important issue is whether recommendations are fair. Unfair\nrecommendations are not only unethical but also harm the long-term interests of\nthe recommender system itself. As a result, fairness issues in recommender\nsystems have recently attracted increasing attention. However, due to multiple\ncomplex resource allocation processes and various fairness definitions, the\nresearch on fairness in recommendation is scattered. To fill this gap, we\nreview over 60 papers published in top conferences/journals, including TOIS,\nSIGIR, and WWW. First, we summarize fairness definitions in the recommendation\nand provide several views to classify fairness issues. Then, we review\nrecommendation datasets and measurements in fairness studies and provide an\nelaborate taxonomy of fairness methods in the recommendation. Finally, we\nconclude this survey by outlining some promising future directions.",

    "abstract": "Accurate camera pose estimation is a fundamental requirement for numerous\napplications, such as autonomous driving, mobile robotics, and augmented\nreality. In this work, we address the problem of estimating the global 6 DoF\ncamera pose from a single RGB image in a given environment. Previous works\nconsider every part of the image valuable for localization. However, many image\nregions such as the sky, occlusions, and repetitive non-distinguishable\npatterns cannot be utilized for localization. In addition to adding unnecessary\ncomputation efforts, extracting and matching features from such regions produce\nmany wrong matches which in turn degrades the localization accuracy and\nefficiency. Our work addresses this particular issue and shows by exploiting an\ninteresting concept of sparse 3D models that we can exploit discriminatory\nenvironment parts and avoid useless image regions for the sake of a single\nimage localization. Interestingly, through avoiding selecting keypoints from\nnon-reliable image regions such as trees, bushes, cars, pedestrians, and\nocclusions, our work acts naturally as an outlier filter. This makes our system\nhighly efficient in that minimal set of correspondences is needed and highly\naccurate as the number of outliers is low. Our work exceeds state-ofthe-art\nmethods on outdoor Cambridge Landmarks dataset. With only relying on single\nimage at inference, it outweighs in terms of accuracy methods that exploit pose\npriors and/or reference 3D models while being much faster. By choosing as\nlittle as 100 correspondences, it surpasses similar methods that localize from\nthousands of correspondences, while being more efficient. In particular, it\nachieves, compared to these methods, an improvement of localization by 33% on\nOldHospital scene. Furthermore, It outstands direct pose regressors even those\nthat learn from sequence of images",

    "abstract": "Many deep reinforcement learning algorithms rely on simple forms of\nexploration, such as the additive action-noise often used in continuous control\ndomains. Typically, the scaling factor of this action noise is chosen as a\nhyper-parameter and kept constant during training. In this paper, we analyze\nhow the learned policy is impacted by the noise type, scale, and reducing of\nthe scaling factor over time. We consider the two most prominent types of\naction-noise: Gaussian and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, and perform a vast\nexperimental campaign by systematically varying the noise type and scale\nparameter, and by measuring variables of interest like the expected return of\nthe policy and the state space coverage during exploration. For the latter, we\npropose a novel state-space coverage measure\n$\\operatorname{X}_{\\mathcal{U}\\text{rel}}$ that is more robust to boundary\nartifacts than previously proposed measures. Larger noise scales generally\nincrease state space coverage. However, we found that increasing the space\ncoverage using a larger noise scale is often not beneficial. On the contrary,\nreducing the noise-scale over the training process reduces the variance and\ngenerally improves the learning performance. We conclude that the best\nnoise-type and scale are environment dependent, and based on our observations,\nderive heuristic rules for guiding the choice of the action noise as a starting\npoint for further optimization.",

Previous methods\neither depend on 3D ConvNets or incorporate additional 2D ConvNets as encoders\nto extract mixed spatial-temporal features.

To tackle these\nlimitations, we propose a Language-Bridged Duplex Transfer (LBDT) module which\nutilizes language as an intermediary bridge to accomplish explicit and adaptive\nspatial-temporal interaction earlier in the encoding phase. Concretely,\ncross-modal attention is performed among the temporal encoder, referring words\nand the spatial encoder to aggregate and transfer language-relevant motion and\nappearance information. In addition, we also propose a Bilateral Channel\nActivation (BCA) module in the decoding phase for further denoising and\nhighlighting the spatial-temporal consistent features via channel-wise\nactivation.

Obtaining the optimal number of users simultaneously\nserved on one resource block (RB) by the $L$ RUs regarding the sum spectral\nefficiency (SE) is not a simple challenge though, as many of the system\nparameters are intertwined.

    "abstract": "For unsupervised pretraining, mask-reconstruction pretraining (MRP)\napproaches randomly mask input patches and then reconstruct pixels or semantic\nfeatures of these masked patches via an auto-encoder. Then for a downstream\ntask, supervised fine-tuning the pretrained encoder remarkably surpasses the\nconventional supervised learning (SL) trained from scratch. However, it is\nstill unclear 1) how MRP performs semantic learning in the pretraining phase\nand 2) why it helps in downstream tasks. To solve these problems, we\ntheoretically show that on an auto-encoder of a two/one-layered convolution\nencoder/decoder, MRP can capture all discriminative semantics in the\npretraining dataset, and accordingly show its provable improvement over SL on\nthe classification downstream task. Specifically, we assume that pretraining\ndataset contains multi-view samples of ratio $1-\\mu$ and single-view samples of\nratio $\\mu$, where multi/single-view samples has multiple/single discriminative\nsemantics. Then for pretraining, we prove that 1) the convolution kernels of\nthe MRP encoder captures all discriminative semantics in the pretraining data;\nand 2) a convolution kernel captures at most one semantic. Accordingly, in the\ndownstream supervised fine-tuning, most semantics would be captured and\ndifferent semantics would not be fused together. This helps the downstream\nfine-tuned network to easily establish the relation between kernels and\nsemantic class labels. In this way, the fine-tuned encoder in MRP provably\nachieves zero test error with high probability for both multi-view and\nsingle-view test data. In contrast, as proved by~[3], conventional SL can only\nobtain a test accuracy between around $0.5\\mu$ for single-view test data. These\nresults together explain the benefits of MRP in downstream tasks. Experimental\nresults testify to multi-view data assumptions and our theoretical\nimplications.",

This paper proposes\nan efficient reversible data hiding scheme via a double-peak two-layer\nembedding (DTLE) strategy with prediction error expansion. The higher six-bit\nplanes of the image are assigned as the HSB plane, and double prediction error\npeaks are applied in either embedding layer. This makes fuller use of the\nredundancy space of images compared with the one error peak strategy. Moreover,\nwe carry out the median-edge detector pre-processing for complex images to\nreduce the size of the auxiliary information.

In addition, we prove that the regret upper\nbound $\\mathcal O(T^{1-\\tau}\\ln T)$, where $\\tau\\in (0.5,1)$ is a constant\ndepending on the algorithm gains.",

    "title": "Perceptual Quality Assessment for Fine-Grained Compressed Images",
    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of image storage and\ntransmission systems, in which image compression plays an important role.\nGenerally speaking, image compression algorithms are developed to ensure good\nvisual quality at limited bit rates. However, due to the different compression\noptimization methods, the compressed images may have different levels of\nquality, which needs to be evaluated quantificationally. Nowadays, the\nmainstream full-reference (FR) metrics are effective to predict the quality of\ncompressed images at coarse-grained levels (the bit rates differences of\ncompressed images are obvious), however, they may perform poorly for\nfine-grained compressed images whose bit rates differences are quite subtle.\nTherefore, to better improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) and provide useful\nguidance for compression algorithms, we propose a full-reference image quality\nassessment (FR-IQA) method for compressed images of fine-grained levels.\nSpecifically, the reference images and compressed images are first converted to\n$YCbCr$ color space. The gradient features are extracted from regions that are\nsensitive to compression artifacts. Then we employ the Log-Gabor transformation\nto further analyze the texture difference. Finally, the obtained features are\nfused into a quality score. The proposed method is validated on the\nfine-grained compression image quality assessment (FGIQA) database, which is\nespecially constructed for assessing the quality of compressed images with\nclose bit rates. The experimental results show that our metric outperforms\nmainstream FR-IQA metrics on the FGIQA database. We also test our method on\nother commonly used compression IQA databases and the results show that our\nmethod obtains competitive performance on the coarse-grained compression IQA\ndatabases as well.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive ability to\ngenerate code for various programming tasks. In many instances, LLMs can\ngenerate a correct program for a task when given numerous trials. Consequently,\na recent trend is to do large scale sampling of programs using a model and then\nfiltering/ranking the programs based on the program execution on a small number\nof known unit tests to select one candidate solution. However, these approaches\nassume that the unit tests are given and assume the ability to safely execute\nthe generated programs (which can do arbitrary dangerous operations such as\nfile manipulations). Both of the above assumptions are impractical in\nreal-world software development. In this paper, we propose fault-aware neural\ncode rankers that can predict the correctness of a sampled program without\nexecuting it. The fault-aware rankers are trained to predict different kinds of\nexecution information such as predicting the exact compile/runtime error type\n(e.g., an IndexError or a TypeError). We show that our fault-aware rankers can\nsignificantly increase the pass@1 accuracy of various code generation models\n(including Codex, GPT-Neo, GPT-J) on APPS, HumanEval and MBPP datasets.",

Anomaly detection is a\nmethod that is capable of detecting unseen abnormal data while only being\ntrained on normal (unannotated) data. Several algorithms based on generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) exist to perform this task, yet certain limitations\nare in place because of the instability of GANs. This paper proposes a new\nmethod by combining an existing method, GANomaly, with progressively growing\nGANs. The latter is known to be more stable, considering its ability to\ngenerate high-resolution images. The method is tested using Fashion MNIST,\nMedical Out-of-Distribution Analysis Challenge (MOOD), and in-house brain MRI;\nusing patches of sizes 16x16 and 32x32. Progressive GANomaly outperforms a\none-class SVM or regular GANomaly on Fashion MNIST. Artificial anomalies are\ncreated in MOOD images with varying intensities and diameters. Progressive\nGANomaly detected the most anomalies with varying intensity and size.\nAdditionally, the intermittent reconstructions are proven to be better from\nprogressive GANomaly.

We study the problem of reconfiguring one\nnon-crossing spanning tree of $P$ to another using a sequence of flips where\neach flip removes one edge and adds one new edge so that the result is again a\nnon-crossing spanning tree of $P$. There is a known upper bound of $2n-4$ flips\n[Avis and Fukuda, 1996] and a lower bound of $1.5n - 5$ flips. We give a\nreconfiguration algorithm that uses at most $2n-3$ flips but reduces that to\n$1.5n-2$ flips when one tree is a path and either: the points are in convex\nposition; or the path is monotone in some direction. For points in convex\nposition, we prove an upper bound of $2d - \\Omega(\\log d)$ where $d$ is half\nthe size of the symmetric difference between the trees. We also examine whether\nthe happy edges (those common to the initial and final trees) need to flip, and\nwe find exact minimum flip distances for small point sets using exhaustive\nsearch.",

Unlike general clinical discussions,\npsychotherapy's core components (viz. symptoms) are hard to distinguish, thus\nbecoming a complex problem to summarize later. A structured counseling\nconversation may contain discussions about symptoms, history of mental health\nissues, or the discovery of the patient's behavior. It may also contain\ndiscussion filler words irrelevant to a clinical summary. We refer to these\nelements of structured psychotherapy as counseling components. In this paper,\nthe aim is mental health counseling summarization to build upon domain\nknowledge and to help clinicians quickly glean meaning. We create a new dataset\nafter annotating 12.9K utterances of counseling components and reference\nsummaries for each dialogue. Further, we propose ConSum, a novel\ncounseling-component guided summarization model. ConSum undergoes three\nindependent modules.

Our comparative study shows that we improve on\nperformance and generate cohesive, semantic, and coherent summaries. We\ncomprehensively analyze the generated summaries to investigate the capturing of\npsychotherapy elements. Human and clinical evaluations on the summary show that\nConSum generates quality summary. Further, mental health experts validate the\nclinical acceptability of the ConSum.

Contrastive learning\n(CL) in the context of UDA can help to better separate classes in feature\nspace. However, in image segmentation, the large memory footprint due to the\ncomputation of the pixel-wise contrastive loss makes it prohibitive to use.\nFurthermore, labeled target data is not easily available in medical imaging,\nand obtaining new samples is not economical. As a result, in this work, we\ntackle a more challenging UDA task when there are only a few (fewshot) or a\nsingle (oneshot) image available from the target domain. We apply a style\ntransfer module to mitigate the scarcity of target samples. Then, to align the\nsource and target features and tackle the memory issue of the traditional\ncontrastive loss, we propose the centroid-based contrastive learning (CCL) and\na centroid norm regularizer (CNR) to optimize the contrastive pairs in both\ndirection and magnitude. In addition, we propose multi-partition centroid\ncontrastive learning (MPCCL) to further reduce the variance in the target\nfeatures.

    "title": "To remove or not remove Mobile Apps? A data-driven predictive model  approach",
    "abstract": "Mobile app stores are the key distributors of mobile applications. They\nregularly apply vetting processes to the deployed apps. Yet, some of these\nvetting processes might be inadequate or applied late. The late removal of\napplications might have unpleasant consequences for developers and users alike.\nThus, in this work we propose a data-driven predictive approach that determines\nwhether the respective app will be removed or accepted. It also indicates the\nfeatures' relevance that help the stakeholders in the interpretation. In turn,\nour approach can support developers in improving their apps and users in\ndownloading the ones that are less likely to be removed. We focus on the Google\nApp store and we compile a new data set of 870,515 applications, 56% of which\nhave actually been removed from the market. Our proposed approach is a\nbootstrap aggregating of multiple XGBoost machine learning classifiers. We\npropose two models: user-centered using 47 features, and developer-centered\nusing 37 features, the ones only available before deployment. We achieve the\nfollowing Areas Under the ROC Curves (AUCs) on the test set: user-centered =\n0.792, developer-centered = 0.762.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate shape-assembling power of a tile-based model of\nself-assembly called the Signal-Passing Tile Assembly Model (STAM). In this\nmodel, the glues that bind tiles together can be turned on and off by the\nbinding actions of other glues via \"signals\". Specifically, the problem we\ninvestigate is \"shape replication\" wherein, given a set of input assemblies of\narbitrary shape, a system must construct an arbitrary number of assemblies with\nthe same shapes and, with the exception of size-bounded junk assemblies that\nresult from the process, no others. We provide the first fully universal shape\nreplication result, namely a single tile set capable of performing shape\nreplication on arbitrary sets of any 3-dimensional shapes without requiring any\nscaling or pre-encoded information in the input assemblies. Our result requires\nthe input assemblies to be composed of signal-passing tiles whose glues can be\ndeactivated to allow deconstruction of those assemblies, which we also prove is\nnecessary by showing that there are shapes whose geometry cannot be replicated\nwithout deconstruction. Additionally, we modularize our construction to create\nsystems capable of creating binary encodings of arbitrary shapes, and building\narbitrary shapes from their encodings. Because the STAM is capable of universal\ncomputation, this then allows for arbitrary programs to be run within an STAM\nsystem, using the shape encodings as input, so that any computable\ntransformation can be performed on the shapes.",

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are envisioned to play a key role\nin future wireless communications, enabling programmable radio propagation\nenvironments. They are usually considered as almost passive planar structures\nthat operate as adjustable reflectors, giving rise to a multitude of\nimplementation challenges, including the inherent difficulty in estimating the\nunderlying wireless channels. In this paper, we focus on the recently conceived\nconcept of Hybrid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (HRISs), which do not\nsolely reflect the impinging waveform in a controllable fashion, but are also\ncapable of sensing and processing an adjustable portion of it. We first present\nimplementation details for this metasurface architecture and propose a\nconvenient mathematical model for characterizing its dual operation. As an\nindicative application of HRISs in wireless communications, we formulate the\nindividual channel estimation problem for the uplink of a multi-user\nHRIS-empowered communication system. Considering first a noise-free setting, we\ntheoretically quantify the advantage of HRISs in notably reducing the amount of\npilots needed for channel estimation, as compared to the case of purely\nreflective RISs. We then present closed-form expressions for the MSE\nperformance in estimating the individual channels at the HRISs and the base\nstation for the noisy model. Based on these derivations, we propose an\nautomatic differentiation-based first-order optimization approach to\nefficiently determine the HRIS phase and power splitting configurations for\nminimizing the weighted sum-MSE performance. Our numerical evaluations\ndemonstrate that HRISs do not only enable the estimation of the individual\nchannels in HRIS-empowered communication systems, but also improve the ability\nto recover the cascaded channel, as compared to existing methods using passive\nand reflective RISs.",

One\nof the classic problems for WFAs is probability distribution estimation over\nsequences of discrete symbols. Although WFAs have been extended to deal with\ncontinuous input data, namely continuous WFAs (CWFAs), it is still unclear how\nto approximate density functions over sequences of continuous random variables\nusing WFA-based models, due to the limitation on the expressiveness of the\nmodel as well as the tractability of approximating density functions via CWFAs.\nIn this paper, we propose a nonlinear extension to the CWFA model to first\nimprove its expressiveness, we refer to it as the nonlinear continuous WFAs\n(NCWFAs). Then we leverage the so-called RNADE method, which is a well-known\ndensity estimator based on neural networks, and propose the RNADE-NCWFA model.\nThe RNADE-NCWFA model computes a density function by design. We show that this\nmodel is strictly more expressive than the Gaussian HMM model, which CWFA\ncannot approximate. Empirically, we conduct a synthetic experiment using\nGaussian HMM generated data.

CL is a very active recent research topic\nconcerned with machine learning under non-stationary data distributions.\nAlthough this naturally applies to RL, the use of dedicated CL methods is still\nuncommon. This may be due to the fact that CL methods often assume a\ndecomposition of CL problems into disjoint sub-tasks of stationary\ndistribution, that the onset of these sub-tasks is known, and that sub-tasks\nare non-contradictory. In this study, we perform an empirical comparison of\nselected CL methods in a RL problem where a physically simulated robot must\nfollow a racetrack by vision. In order to make CL methods applicable, we\nrestrict the RL setting and introduce non-conflicting subtasks of known onset,\nwhich are however not disjoint and whose distribution, from the learner's point\nof view, is still non-stationary.

    "title": "Construction of a spike-based memory using neural-like logic gates based  on Spiking Neural Networks on SpiNNaker",
    "abstract": "Neuromorphic engineering concentrates the efforts of a large number of\nresearchers due to its great potential as a field of research, in a search for\nthe exploitation of the advantages of the biological nervous system and the\nbrain as a whole for the design of more efficient and real-time capable\napplications. For the development of applications as close to biology as\npossible, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are used, considered\nbiologically-plausible and that form the third generation of Artificial Neural\nNetworks (ANNs). Since some SNN-based applications may need to store data in\norder to use it later, something that is present both in digital circuits and,\nin some form, in biology, a spiking memory is needed. This work presents a\nspiking implementation of a memory, which is one of the most important\ncomponents in the computer architecture, and which could be essential in the\ndesign of a fully spiking computer. In the process of designing this spiking\nmemory, different intermediate components were also implemented and tested. The\ntests were carried out on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic platform and allow to\nvalidate the approach used for the construction of the presented blocks. In\naddition, this work studies in depth how to build spiking blocks using this\napproach and includes a comparison between it and those used in other similar\nworks focused on the design of spiking components, which include both spiking\nlogic gates and spiking memory. All implemented blocks and developed tests are\navailable in a public repository.",

    "abstract": "Behavior prediction models have proliferated in recent years, especially in\nthe popular real-world robotics application of autonomous driving, where\nrepresenting the distribution over possible futures of moving agents is\nessential for safe and comfortable motion planning. In these models, the choice\nof coordinate frames to represent inputs and outputs has crucial trade offs\nwhich broadly fall into one of two categories. Agent-centric models transform\ninputs and perform inference in agent-centric coordinates. These models are\nintrinsically invariant to translation and rotation between scene elements, are\nbest-performing on public leaderboards, but scale quadratically with the number\nof agents and scene elements. Scene-centric models use a fixed coordinate\nsystem to process all agents. This gives them the advantage of sharing\nrepresentations among all agents, offering efficient amortized inference\ncomputation which scales linearly with the number of agents. However, these\nmodels have to learn invariance to translation and rotation between scene\nelements, and typically underperform agent-centric models. In this work, we\ndevelop knowledge distillation techniques between probabilistic motion\nforecasting models, and apply these techniques to close the gap in performance\nbetween agent-centric and scene-centric models. This improves scene-centric\nmodel performance by 13.2% on the public Argoverse benchmark, 7.8% on Waymo\nOpen Dataset and up to 9.4% on a large In-House dataset. These improved\nscene-centric models rank highly in public leaderboards and are up to 15 times\nmore efficient than their agent-centric teacher counterparts in busy scenes.",

As such, the computational efficiency is substantially improved.\nFurthermore, this establishes the first nonlinear control system that\nstabilizes the coupled longitudinal and lateral dynamics of flapping wing\naerial vehicle without relying on averaging or linearization.

In addition, a weighted\nstacked strategy is proposed to replace the conventional feature fusion method.\nThe weights of the features are determined based on their levels.

To reduce the severity of the problem, in this paper, we\nintroduce a novel task, hate speech normalization, that aims to weaken the\nintensity of hatred exhibited by an online post. The intention of hate speech\nnormalization is not to support hate but instead to provide the users with a\nstepping stone towards non-hate while giving online platforms more time to\nmonitor any improvement in the user's behavior.\nTo this end, we manually curated a parallel corpus - hate texts and their\nnormalized counterparts (a normalized text is less hateful and more benign). We\nintroduce NACL, a simple yet efficient hate speech normalization model that\noperates in three stages - first, it measures the hate intensity of the\noriginal sample; second, it identifies the hate span(s) within it; and finally,\nit reduces hate intensity by paraphrasing the hate spans. We perform extensive\nexperiments to measure the efficacy of NACL via three-way evaluation\n(intrinsic, extrinsic, and human-study). We observe that NACL outperforms six\nbaselines - NACL yields a score of 0.1365 RMSE for the intensity prediction,\n0.622 F1-score in the span identification, and 82.27 BLEU and 80.05 perplexity\nfor the normalized text generation. We further show the generalizability of\nNACL across other platforms (Reddit, Facebook, Gab). An interactive prototype\nof NACL was put together for the user study.

    "abstract": "Most of the trace-checking tools only yield a Boolean verdict.

Existing approaches that complement trace-checking tools with\ndiagnostic capabilities either produce low-level explanations that are hardly\ncomprehensible by engineers or do not support complex signal-based temporal\nproperties. In this paper, we propose TD-SB-TemPsy, a trace-diagnostic approach\nfor properties expressed using SB-TemPsy-DSL. Given a property and a trace that\nviolates the property, TD-SB-TemPsy determines the root cause of the property\nviolation. TD-SB-TemPsy relies on the concepts of violation cause, which\ncharacterizes one of the behaviors of the system that may lead to a property\nviolation, and diagnoses, which are associated with violation causes and\nprovide additional information to help engineers understand the violation\ncause. As part of TD-SB-TemPsy, we propose a language-agnostic methodology to\ndefine violation causes and diagnoses.

    "title": "CO^3: Cooperative Unsupervised 3D Representation Learning for Autonomous  Driving",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised contrastive learning for indoor-scene point clouds has achieved\ngreat successes. However, unsupervised learning point clouds in outdoor scenes\nremains challenging because previous methods need to reconstruct the whole\nscene and capture partial views for the contrastive objective. This is\ninfeasible in outdoor scenes with moving objects, obstacles, and sensors. In\nthis paper, we propose CO^3, namely Cooperative Contrastive Learning and\nContextual Shape Prediction, to learn 3D representation for outdoor-scene point\nclouds in an unsupervised manner. CO^3 has several merits compared to existing\nmethods. (1) It utilizes LiDAR point clouds from vehicle-side and\ninfrastructure-side to build views that differ enough but meanwhile maintain\ncommon semantic information for contrastive learning, which are more\nappropriate than views built by previous methods. (2) Alongside the contrastive\nobjective, shape context prediction is proposed as pre-training goal and brings\nmore task-relevant information for unsupervised 3D point cloud representation\nlearning, which are beneficial when transferring the learned representation to\ndownstream detection tasks. (3) As compared to previous methods, representation\nlearned by CO^3 is able to be transferred to different outdoor scene dataset\ncollected by different type of LiDAR sensors. (4) CO^3 improves current\nstate-of-the-art methods on both Once and KITTI datasets by up to 2.58 mAP.\nCodes and models will be released. We believe CO^3 will facilitate\nunderstanding LiDAR point clouds in outdoor scene.",

    "title": "Accelerating Score-based Generative Models for High-Resolution Image  Synthesis",
    "abstract": "Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a promising\nclass of generative models. The key idea is to produce high-quality images by\nrecurrently adding Gaussian noises and gradients to a Gaussian sample until\nconverging to the target distribution, a.k.a. the diffusion sampling. To ensure\nstability of convergence in sampling and generation quality, however, this\nsequential sampling process has to take a small step size and many sampling\niterations (e.g., 2000). Several acceleration methods have been proposed with\nfocus on low-resolution generation. In this work, we consider the acceleration\nof high-resolution generation with SGMs, a more challenging yet more important\nproblem. We prove theoretically that this slow convergence drawback is\nprimarily due to the ignorance of the target distribution. Further, we\nintroduce a novel Target Distribution Aware Sampling (TDAS) method by\nleveraging the structural priors in space and frequency domains. Extensive\nexperiments on CIFAR-10, CelebA, LSUN, and FFHQ datasets validate that TDAS can\nconsistently accelerate state-of-the-art SGMs, particularly on more challenging\nhigh resolution (1024x1024) image generation tasks by up to 18.4x, whilst\nlargely maintaining the synthesis quality. With fewer sampling iterations, TDAS\ncan still generate good quality images. In contrast, the existing methods\ndegrade drastically or even fails completely",

    "abstract": "In recent years, machine learning (ML) has come to rely more heavily on\ncrowdworkers, both for building bigger datasets and for addressing research\nquestions requiring human interaction or judgment. Owing to the diverse tasks\nperformed by crowdworkers, and the myriad ways the resulting datasets are used,\nit can be difficult to determine when these individuals are best thought of as\nworkers, versus as human subjects. These difficulties are compounded by\nconflicting policies, with some institutions and researchers treating all ML\ncrowdwork as human subjects research, and other institutions holding that ML\ncrowdworkers rarely constitute human subjects. Additionally, few ML papers\ninvolving crowdwork mention IRB oversight, raising the prospect that many might\nnot be in compliance with ethical and regulatory requirements. In this paper,\nwe focus on research in natural language processing to investigate the\nappropriate designation of crowdsourcing studies and the unique challenges that\nML research poses for research oversight. Crucially, under the U.S. Common\nRule, these judgments hinge on determinations of \"aboutness\", both whom (or\nwhat) the collected data is about and whom (or what) the analysis is about. We\nhighlight two challenges posed by ML: (1) the same set of workers can serve\nmultiple roles and provide many sorts of information; and (2) compared to the\nlife sciences and social sciences, ML research tends to embrace a dynamic\nworkflow, where research questions are seldom stated ex ante and data sharing\nopens the door for future studies to ask questions about different targets from\nthe original study. In particular, our analysis exposes a potential loophole in\nthe Common Rule, where researchers can elude research ethics oversight by\nsplitting data collection and analysis into distinct studies. We offer several\npolicy recommendations to address these concerns.",

Critically, this formulation allows extracting rich 3D\nrepresentation from 2D images without any depth supervision, and with the\nbuilt-in geometry structure consistent w.r.t. BEV.

    "abstract": "In this work, we compare the performance of the Quantum Approximate\nOptimization Algorithm (QAOA) with state-of-the-art classical solvers such as\nGurobi and MQLib to solve the combinatorial optimization problem MaxCut on\n3-regular graphs. The goal is to identify under which conditions QAOA can\nachieve \"quantum advantage\" over classical algorithms, in terms of both\nsolution quality and time to solution. One might be able to achieve quantum\nadvantage on hundreds of qubits and moderate depth $p$ by sampling the QAOA\nstate at a frequency of order 10 kHz. We observe, however, that classical\nheuristic solvers are capable of producing high-quality approximate solutions\nin $\\textit{linear}$ time complexity. In order to match this quality for\n$\\textit{large}$ graph sizes $N$, a quantum device must support depth $p>11$.\nOtherwise, we demonstrate that the number of required samples grows\nexponentially with $N$, hindering the scalability of QAOA with $p\\leq11$. These\nresults put challenging bounds on achieving quantum advantage for QAOA MaxCut\non 3-regular graphs. Other problems, such as different graphs, weighted MaxCut,\nmaximum independent set, and 3-SAT, may be better suited for achieving quantum\nadvantage on near-term quantum devices.",

Sufficient\nconditions for ISS are constructed by using the method of Lyapunov functionals.\nIt is shown that, when the continuous dynamics are ISS but the discrete\ndynamics governing the delay-dependent impulses are not, the impulsive system\nas a whole is ISS provided the destabilizing impulses do not occur too\nfrequently. On the contrary, when the discrete dynamics are ISS but the\ncontinuous dynamics are not, the delayed impulses must occur frequently enough\nto overcome the destabilizing effects of the continuous dynamics so that the\nISS can be achieved for the impulsive system.

    "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) is of great importance in clinical practice due to\nits powerful ability to provide patients' anatomical information without any\ninvasive inspection, but its potential radiation risk is raising people's\nconcerns. Deep learning-based methods are considered promising in CT\nreconstruction, but these network models are usually trained with the measured\ndata obtained from specific scanning protocol and need to centralizedly collect\nlarge amounts of data, which will lead to serious data domain shift, and\nprivacy concerns. To relieve these problems, in this paper, we propose a\nhypernetwork-based federated learning method for personalized CT imaging,\ndubbed as HyperFed. The basic assumption of HyperFed is that the optimization\nproblem for each institution can be divided into two parts: the local data\nadaption problem and the global CT imaging problem, which are implemented by an\ninstitution-specific hypernetwork and a global-sharing imaging network,\nrespectively. The purpose of global-sharing imaging network is to learn stable\nand effective common features from different institutions. The\ninstitution-specific hypernetwork is carefully designed to obtain\nhyperparameters to condition the global-sharing imaging network for\npersonalized local CT reconstruction. Experiments show that HyperFed achieves\ncompetitive performance in CT reconstruction compared with several other\nstate-of-the-art methods. It is believed as a promising direction to improve CT\nimaging quality and achieve personalized demands of different institutions or\nscanners without privacy data sharing.

In this paper, we mainly considered gradient\ndescent of linear regression under DA using noisy copies of datasets, in which\nnoise is injected into inputs. We analyzed the situation where random noisy\ncopies are newly generated and used at each epoch; i.e., the case of using\non-line noisy copies. Therefore, it is viewed as an analysis on a method using\nnoise injection into training process by DA manner; i.e., on-line version of\nDA. We derived the averaged behavior of training process under three situations\nwhich are the full-batch training under the sum of squared errors, the\nfull-batch and mini-batch training under the mean squared error. We showed\nthat, in all cases, training for DA with on-line copies is approximately\nequivalent to a ridge regression training whose regularization parameter\ncorresponds to the variance of injected noise. On the other hand, we showed\nthat the learning rate is multiplied by the number of noisy copies plus one in\nfull-batch under the sum of squared errors and the mini-batch under the mean\nsquared error; i.e., DA with on-line copies yields apparent acceleration of\ntraining. The apparent acceleration and regularization effect come from the\noriginal part and noise in a copy data respectively. These results are\nconfirmed in a numerical experiment. In the numerical experiment, we found that\nour result can be approximately applied to usual off-line DA in\nunder-parameterization scenario and can not in over-parametrization scenario.\nMoreover, we experimentally investigated the training process of neural\nnetworks under DA with off-line noisy copies and found that our analysis on\nlinear regression is possible to be applied to neural networks.",

In the current\nsituation, the disease course classification is significant for medical\npersonnel to decide the treatment. Most previous deep-learning-based methods\nextract features observed from the lung window. However, it has been proved\nthat some appearances related to diagnosis can be observed better from the\nmediastinal window rather than the lung window, e.g., the pulmonary\nconsolidation happens more in severe symptoms. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Dual Window RCNN Network (DWRNet), which mainly learns the distinctive\nfeatures from the successive mediastinal window. Regarding the features\nextracted from the lung window, we introduce the Lung Window Attention Block\n(LWA Block) to pay additional attention to them for enhancing the\nmediastinal-window features. Moreover, instead of picking up specific slices\nfrom the whole CT slices, we use a Recurrent CNN and analyze successive slices\nas videos. Experimental results show that the fused and representative features\nimprove the predictions of disease course by reaching the accuracy of 90.57%,\nagainst the baseline with an accuracy of 84.86%.

    "abstract": "Myocardial motion and deformation are rich descriptors that characterize\ncardiac function. Image registration, as the most commonly used technique for\nmyocardial motion tracking, is an ill-posed inverse problem which often\nrequires prior assumptions on the solution space. In contrast to most existing\napproaches which impose explicit generic regularization such as smoothness, in\nthis work we propose a novel method that can implicitly learn an\napplication-specific biomechanics-informed prior and embed it into a neural\nnetwork-parameterized transformation model. Particularly, the proposed method\nleverages a variational autoencoder-based generative model to learn a manifold\nfor biomechanically plausible deformations. The motion tracking then can be\nperformed via traversing the learnt manifold to search for the optimal\ntransformations while considering the sequence information. The proposed method\nis validated on three public cardiac cine MRI datasets with comprehensive\nevaluations. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform\nother approaches, yielding higher motion tracking accuracy with reasonable\nvolume preservation and better generalizability to varying data distributions.\nIt also enables better estimates of myocardial strains, which indicates the\npotential of the method in characterizing spatiotemporal signatures for\nunderstanding cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Exponential generalization bounds with near-tight rates have recently been\nestablished for uniformly stable learning algorithms. The notion of uniform\nstability, however, is stringent in the sense that it is invariant to the\ndata-generating distribution. Under the weaker and distribution dependent\nnotions of stability such as hypothesis stability and $L_2$-stability, the\nliterature suggests that only polynomial generalization bounds are possible in\ngeneral cases. The present paper addresses this long standing tension between\nthese two regimes of results and makes progress towards relaxing it inside a\nclassic framework of confidence-boosting. To this end, we first establish an\nin-expectation first moment generalization error bound for potentially\nrandomized learning algorithms with $L_2$-stability, based on which we then\nshow that a properly designed subbagging process leads to near-tight\nexponential generalization bounds over the randomness of both data and\nalgorithm. We further substantialize these generic results to stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD) to derive improved high-probability generalization\nbounds for convex or non-convex optimization problems with natural time\ndecaying learning rates, which have not been possible to prove with the\nexisting hypothesis stability or uniform stability based results.",

    "abstract": "Chest X-ray (CXR) is the most typical radiological exam for diagnosis of\nvarious diseases. Due to the expensive and time-consuming annotations,\ndetecting anomalies in CXRs in an unsupervised fashion is very promising.\nHowever, almost all of the existing methods consider anomaly detection as a\nOne-Class Classification (OCC) problem. They model the distribution of only\nknown normal images during training and identify the samples not conforming to\nnormal profile as anomalies in the testing phase. A large number of unlabeled\nimages containing anomalies are thus ignored in the training phase, although\nthey are easy to obtain in clinical practice. In this paper, we propose a novel\nstrategy, Dual-distribution Discrepancy for Anomaly Detection (DDAD), utilizing\nboth known normal images and unlabeled images. The proposed method consists of\ntwo modules, denoted as A and B. During training, module A takes both known\nnormal and unlabeled images as inputs, capturing anomalous features from\nunlabeled images in some way, while module B models the distribution of only\nknown normal images. Subsequently, the inter-discrepancy between modules A and\nB, and intra-discrepancy inside module B are designed as anomaly scores to\nindicate anomalies. Experiments on three CXR datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed DDAD achieves consistent, significant gains and outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Semantic noise refers to the\nmisleading between the intended semantic symbols and received ones, thus cause\nthe failure of tasks. In this paper, we first propose a framework for the\nrobust end-to-end semantic communication systems to combat the semantic noise.\nIn particular, we analyze sample-dependent and sample-independent semantic\nnoise. To combat the semantic noise, the adversarial training with weight\nperturbation is developed to incorporate the samples with semantic noise in the\ntraining dataset. Then, we propose to mask a portion of the input, where the\nsemantic noise appears frequently, and design the masked vector\nquantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) with the noise-related masking\nstrategy. We use a discrete codebook shared by the transmitter and the receiver\nfor encoded feature representation. To further improve the system robustness,\nwe develop a feature importance module (FIM) to suppress the noise-related and\ntask-unrelated features. Thus, the transmitter simply needs to transmit the\nindices of these important task-related features in the codebook. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed method can be applied in many downstream tasks\nand significantly improve the robustness against semantic noise with remarkable\nreduction on the transmission overhead.",

    "abstract": "Lagrangian trajectory or particle dispersion models as well as\nsemi-Lagrangian advection schemes require meteorological data such as wind,\ntemperature and geopotential at the exact spatio-temporal locations of the\nparticles that move independently from a regular grid. Traditionally, this\nhigh-resolution data has been obtained by interpolating the meteorological\nparameters from the gridded data of a meteorological model or reanalysis, e.g.\nusing linear interpolation in space and time. However, interpolation errors are\na large source of error for these models. Reducing them requires meteorological\ninput fields with high space and time resolution, which may not always be\navailable and can cause severe data storage and transfer problems. Here, we\ninterpret this problem as a single image superresolution task. We interpret\nmeteorological fields available at their native resolution as low-resolution\nimages and train deep neural networks to up-scale them to higher resolution,\nthereby providing more accurate data for Lagrangian models. We train various\nversions of the state-of-the-art Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for\nSuperresolution on low-resolution ERA5 reanalysis data with the goal to\nup-scale these data to arbitrary spatial resolution. We show that the resulting\nup-scaled wind fields have root-mean-squared errors half the size of the winds\nobtained with linear spatial interpolation at acceptable computational\ninference costs. In a test setup using the Lagrangian particle dispersion model\nFLEXPART and reduced-resolution wind fields, we demonstrate that absolute\nhorizontal transport deviations of calculated trajectories from \"ground-truth\"\ntrajectories calculated with undegraded 0.5{\\deg} winds are reduced by at least\n49.5% (21.8%) after 48 hours relative to trajectories using linear\ninterpolation of the wind data when training on 2{\\deg} to 1{\\deg} (4{\\deg} to\n2{\\deg}) resolution data.",

    "title": "High-dimensional limit theorems for SGD: Effective dynamics and critical  scaling",
    "abstract": "We study the scaling limits of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with\nconstant step-size in the high-dimensional regime. We prove limit theorems for\nthe trajectories of summary statistics (i.e., finite-dimensional functions) of\nSGD as the dimension goes to infinity. Our approach allows one to choose the\nsummary statistics that are tracked, the initialization, and the step-size. It\nyields both ballistic (ODE) and diffusive (SDE) limits, with the limit\ndepending dramatically on the former choices. Interestingly, we find a critical\nscaling regime for the step-size below which the effective ballistic dynamics\nmatches gradient flow for the population loss, but at which, a new correction\nterm appears which changes the phase diagram. About the fixed points of this\neffective dynamics, the corresponding diffusive limits can be quite complex and\neven degenerate. We demonstrate our approach on popular examples including\nestimation for spiked matrix and tensor models and classification via two-layer\nnetworks for binary and XOR-type Gaussian mixture models. These examples\nexhibit surprising phenomena including multimodal timescales to convergence as\nwell as convergence to sub-optimal solutions with probability bounded away from\nzero from random (e.g., Gaussian) initializations.",
