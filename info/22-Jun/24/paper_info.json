    "abstract": "We present an improved library for the ranking problem called RPLIB. RPLIB\nincludes the following data and features. (1) Real and artificial datasets of\nboth pairwise data (i.e., information about the ranking of pairs of items) and\nfeature data (i.e., a vector of features about each item to be ranked). These\ndatasets range in size (e.g., from small $n=10$ item datasets to large datasets\nwith hundred of items), application (e.g., from sports to economic data), and\nsource (e.g. real versus artificially generated to have particular structures).\n(2) RPLIB contains code for the most common ranking algorithms such as the\nlinear ordering optimization method and the Massey method. (3) RPLIB also has\nthe ability for users to contribute their own data, code, and algorithms. Each\nRPLIB dataset has an associated .JSON model card of additional information such\nas the number and set of optimal rankings, the optimal objective value, and\ncorresponding figures.",

    "title": "Latent Policies for Adversarial Imitation Learning",
    "abstract": "This paper considers learning robot locomotion and manipulation tasks from\nexpert demonstrations. Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) trains\na discriminator that distinguishes expert from agent transitions, and in turn\nuse a reward defined by the discriminator output to optimize a policy generator\nfor the agent. This generative adversarial training approach is very powerful\nbut depends on a delicate balance between the discriminator and the generator\ntraining. In high-dimensional problems, the discriminator training may easily\noverfit or exploit associations with task-irrelevant features for transition\nclassification. A key insight of this work is that performing imitation\nlearning in a suitable latent task space makes the training process stable,\neven in challenging high-dimensional problems. We use an action encoder-decoder\nmodel to obtain a low-dimensional latent action space and train a LAtent Policy\nusing Adversarial imitation Learning (LAPAL). The encoder-decoder model can be\ntrained offline from state-action pairs to obtain a task-agnostic latent action\nrepresentation or online, simultaneously with the discriminator and generator\ntraining, to obtain a task-aware latent action representation. We demonstrate\nthat LAPAL training is stable, with near-monotonic performance improvement, and\nachieves expert performance in most locomotion and manipulation tasks, while a\nGAIL baseline converges slower and does not achieve expert performance in\nhigh-dimensional environments.",

    "abstract": "To capture inherent geometric features of many community detection problems,\nwe propose to use a new random graph model of communities that we call a\n\\emph{Geometric Block Model}. The geometric block model builds on the\n\\emph{random geometric graphs} (Gilbert, 1961), one of the basic models of\nrandom graphs for spatial networks, in the same way that the well-studied\nstochastic block model builds on the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{en}yi random graphs. It is\nalso a natural extension of random community models inspired by the recent\ntheoretical and practical advancements in community detection. To analyze the\ngeometric block model, we first provide new connectivity results for\n\\emph{random annulus graphs} which are generalizations of random geometric\ngraphs. The connectivity properties of geometric graphs have been studied since\ntheir introduction, and analyzing them has been difficult due to correlated\nedge formation.\nWe then use the connectivity results of random annulus graphs to provide\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for efficient recovery of communities for\nthe geometric block model. We show that a simple triangle-counting algorithm to\ndetect communities in the geometric block model is near-optimal. For this we\nconsider two regimes of graph density.\nIn the regime where the average degree of the graph grows logarithmically\nwith number of vertices, we show that our algorithm performs extremely well,\nboth theoretically and practically. In contrast, the triangle-counting\nalgorithm is far from being optimum for the stochastic block model in the\nlogarithmic degree regime. We also look at the regime where the average degree\nof the graph grows linearly with the number of vertices $n$, and hence to store\nthe graph one needs $\\Theta(n^2)$ memory. We show that our algorithm needs to\nstore only $O(n \\log n)$ edges in this regime to recover the latent\ncommunities.",

A hybrid approach was developed to\naccount for these concerns by leveraging existing techniques: a modified beta\nfactor model allows single components to be placed within multiple CCCGs, while\na second technique provides software-specific model parameters for each CCCG.\nThis hybrid approach provides a means to overcome the limitations of\nconventional methods while offering support for design decisions under the\nlimited data scenario.",

    "abstract": "We continue the study of $\\delta$-dispersion, a continuous facility location\nproblem on a graph where all edges have unit length and where the facilities\nmay also be positioned in the interior of the edges. The goal is to position as\nmany facilities as possible subject to the condition that every two facilities\nhave distance at least $\\delta$ from each other. Our main technical\ncontribution is an efficient procedure to `round-up' distance $\\delta$. It\ntransforms a $\\delta$-dispersed set $S$ into a $\\delta^\\star$-dispersed set\n$S^\\star$ of same size where distance $\\delta^\\star$ is a slightly larger\nrational $\\tfrac{a}{b}$ with a numerator $a$ upper bounded by the longest\n(not-induced) path in the input graph. Based on this rounding procedure and\nconnections to the distance-$d$ independent set problem we derive a number of\nalgorithmic results. When parameterized by treewidth, the problem is in XP.\nWhen parameterized by treedepth the problem is FPT and has a matching lower\nbound on its time complexity under ETH. Moreover, we can also settle the\nparameterized complexity with the solution size as parameter using our rounding\ntechnique: $\\delta$-\\dispersion is FPT for every $\\delta \\leq 2$ and W[1]-hard\nfor every $\\delta > 2$. Further, we show that $\\delta$-dispersion is\nNP-complete for every fixed irrational distance $\\delta$, which was left open\nin a previous work.",

    "abstract": "Employing skin-like tactile sensors on robots enhances both the safety and\nusability of collaborative robots by adding the capability to detect human\ncontact. Unfortunately, simple binary tactile sensors alone cannot determine\nthe context of the human contact -- whether it is a deliberate interaction or\nan unintended collision that requires safety manoeuvres. Many published methods\nclassify discrete interactions using more advanced tactile sensors or by\nanalysing joint torques. Instead, we propose to augment the intention\nrecognition capabilities of simple binary tactile sensors by adding a\nrobot-mounted camera for human posture analysis. Different interaction\ncharacteristics, including touch location, human pose, and gaze direction, are\nused to train a supervised machine learning algorithm to classify whether a\ntouch is intentional or not with 92% accuracy. We demonstrate that multimodal\nintention recognition is significantly more accurate than monomodal analysis\nwith the collaborative robot Baxter. Furthermore, our method can also\ncontinuously monitor interactions that fluidly change between intentional or\nunintentional by gauging the user's attention through gaze. If a user stops\npaying attention mid-task, the proposed intention and attention recognition\nalgorithm can activate safety features to prevent unsafe interactions. In\naddition, the proposed method is robot and touch sensor layout agnostic and is\ncomplementary with other methods.",

While these two tasks are complementary, few works have\nbeen able to explore them in parallel to advance indoor geometric perception,\nand those that have done so either relied on synthetic data, or used small\nscale datasets, as few options are available that include both layout\nannotations and dense depth maps in real scenes. This is partly due to the\nnecessity of manual annotations for room layouts. In this work, we move beyond\nthis limitation and generate a 360 geometric vision (360V) dataset that\nincludes multiple modalities, multi-view stereo data and automatically\ngenerated weak layout cues. We also explore an explicit coupling between the\ntwo tasks to integrate them into a singleshot trained model.

These smooth dynamics are interrupted at\nbifurcations, where solutions change qualitatively. Sub-optimal test channels\nmay collide or exchange optimality there, for example. There is typically a\nplethora of sub-optimal solutions, which stems from restrictions of the\nreproduction alphabet.\nWe devise a family of algorithms that exploits the underlying dynamics to\ntrack a given test channel along the rate-distortion curve. To that end, we\nexpress implicit derivatives at the roots of a non-linear operator by higher\nderivative tensors.

Many modern observability platforms support dimensional models of\ntelemetry signals where the measurements are accompanied by additional\ndimensions used to identify either the resources described by the telemetry or\nthe business-specific attributes of the activities (e.g., a customer\nidentifier). However, most of these platforms lack any semantic understanding\nof the data, by not capturing any metadata about telemetry, from simple aspects\nsuch as units of measure or data types (treating all dimensions as strings) to\nmore complex concepts such as purpose policies. This limits the ability of the\nplatforms to provide a rich user experience, especially when dealing with\ndifferent telemetry assets, for example, linking an anomaly in a time series\nwith the corresponding subset of logs or traces, which requires semantic\nunderstanding of the dimensions in the respective data sets.\nIn this paper, we describe a schema-first approach to application telemetry\nthat is being implemented at Meta. It allows the observability platforms to\ncapture metadata about telemetry from the start and enables a wide range of\nfunctionalities, including compile-time input validation, multi-signal\ncorrelations and cross-filtering, and even privacy rules enforcement.

While process execution is about actuation, i.e. actively\ntriggering actions and awaiting their completion, accompanying IoT sensors\nmonitor humans and the environment. These sensors produce large amounts of\nprocedural, discrete, and continuous data streams, that hold the key to\nunderstanding the quality of process subjects (e.g. produced parts), outcome\n(e.g. quantity and quality), and error causes.

Due to the low-latency\nrequirements, the URLLC messages are transmitted over fewer channel uses\ncompared to the eMBB messages. To improve the reliability of the URLLC\ntransmissions, we propose a coding scheme with finite blocklength codewords\nthat exploits dirty-paper coding (DPC) to precancel the interference from eMBB\ntransmissions. Rigorous bounds are derived for the error probabilities of eMBB\nand URLLC transmissions achieved by our scheme. Numerical results illustrate\nthat they are lower than for standard time-sharing.",

    "abstract": "Learning control from pixels is difficult for reinforcement learning (RL)\nagents because representation learning and policy learning are intertwined.\nPrevious approaches remedy this issue with auxiliary representation learning\ntasks, but they either do not consider the temporal aspect of the problem or\nonly consider single-step transitions. Instead, we propose Hierarchical\n$k$-Step Latent (HKSL), an auxiliary task that learns representations via a\nhierarchy of forward models that operate at varying magnitudes of step skipping\nwhile also learning to communicate between levels in the hierarchy. We evaluate\nHKSL in a suite of 30 robotic control tasks and find that HKSL either reaches\nhigher episodic returns or converges to maximum performance more quickly than\nseveral current baselines. Also, we find that levels in HKSL's hierarchy can\nlearn to specialize in long- or short-term consequences of agent actions,\nthereby providing the downstream control policy with more informative\nrepresentations. Finally, we determine that communication channels between\nhierarchy levels organize information based on both sides of the communication\nprocess, which improves sample efficiency.",

    "abstract": "It has been a long-standing dream to design artificial agents that explore\ntheir environment efficiently via intrinsic motivation, similar to how children\nperform curious free play. Despite recent advances in intrinsically motivated\nreinforcement learning (RL), sample-efficient exploration in object\nmanipulation scenarios remains a significant challenge as most of the relevant\ninformation lies in the sparse agent-object and object-object interactions. In\nthis paper, we propose to use structured world models to incorporate relational\ninductive biases in the control loop to achieve sample-efficient and\ninteraction-rich exploration in compositional multi-object environments. By\nplanning for future novelty inside structured world models, our method\ngenerates free-play behavior that starts to interact with objects early on and\ndevelops more complex behavior over time. Instead of using models only to\ncompute intrinsic rewards, as commonly done, our method showcases that the\nself-reinforcing cycle between good models and good exploration also opens up\nanother avenue: zero-shot generalization to downstream tasks via model-based\nplanning. After the entirely intrinsic task-agnostic exploration phase, our\nmethod solves challenging downstream tasks such as stacking, flipping, pick &\nplace, and throwing that generalizes to unseen numbers and arrangements of\nobjects without any additional training.",

First,\nwe provide a comprehensive discussion of the DER inadequacy concept and the\nchallenges it poses. Then, a decentralized and coordinated control framework is\nproposed to regulate the output of inverter based generations and reallocate\nlimited DER capacity for Vf regulation. The control framework is composed of a\npower regulator and a Vf regulator, which generate the supplementary signals\nfor the primary controller. The power regulator regulates the output of grid\nforming inverters according to the realtime capacity constraints of DERs, while\nthe Vf regulator improves the Vf deviation by leveraging the load sensitivity\nto Vf. Next, the static feasibility and dynamic stability of the proposed\nmethod are rigorously proven through mathematical formulation and eigenvalue\nanalysis. Finally, a MATLAB Simulink simulation demonstrates the\nfunctionalities of the control framework. A few goals are fulfilled within the\ndecentralized and coordinated framework, such as making the best use of limited\nDER capacity, enhancing the DC side stability of inverter based generations,\nimproving power sharing results, and reducing involuntary load shedding.",

    "abstract": "With the ever growing involvement of data-driven AI-based decision making\ntechnologies in our daily social lives, the fairness of these systems is\nbecoming a crucial phenomenon. However, an important and often challenging\naspect in utilizing such systems is to distinguish validity for the range of\ntheir application especially under distribution shifts, i.e., when a model is\ndeployed on data with different distribution than the training set. In this\npaper, we present a case study on the newly released American Census datasets,\na reconstruction of the popular Adult dataset, to illustrate the importance of\ncontext for fairness and show how remarkably can spatial distribution shifts\naffect predictive- and fairness-related performance of a model. The problem\npersists for fairness-aware learning models with the effects of\ncontext-specific fairness interventions differing across the states and\ndifferent population groups. Our study suggests that robustness to distribution\nshifts is necessary before deploying a model to another context.",

The classical\nartificial intelligence algorithms require centralized data collection and\nprocessing which are challenging in realistic intelligent IoT applications due\nto growing data privacy concerns and distributed datasets. Federated Learning\n(FL) has emerged as a distributed privacy-preserving learning framework that\nenables IoT devices to train global model through sharing model parameters.\nHowever, inefficiency due to frequent parameters transmissions significantly\nreduce FL performance.

This framework allows one to\ntransform any regression model into a calibrated probabilistic model. The\nmodular design of MCC allows us to make simple adjustments to existing\nalgorithms that enable well-behaved distribution predictions. We also provide\nfinite-sample calibration guarantees for MCC algorithms.

    "abstract": "This paper presents exploratory work on whether and to what extent biases\nagainst queer and trans people are encoded in large language models (LLMs) such\nas BERT. We also propose a method for reducing these biases in downstream\ntasks: finetuning the models on data written by and/or about queer people. To\nmeasure anti-queer bias, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, WinoQueer,\nmodeled after other bias-detection benchmarks but addressing homophobic and\ntransphobic biases. We found that BERT shows significant homophobic bias, but\nthis bias can be mostly mitigated by finetuning BERT on a natural language\ncorpus written by members of the LGBTQ+ community.",

    "abstract": "In most of the literature on federated learning (FL), neural networks are\ninitialized with random weights. In this paper, we present an empirical study\non the effect of pre-training on FL. Specifically, we aim to investigate if\npre-training can alleviate the drastic accuracy drop when clients'\ndecentralized data are non-IID. We focus on FedAvg, the fundamental and most\nwidely used FL algorithm. We found that pre-training does largely close the gap\nbetween FedAvg and centralized learning under non-IID data, but this does not\ncome from alleviating the well-known model drifting problem in FedAvg's local\ntraining. Instead, how pre-training helps FedAvg is by making FedAvg's global\naggregation more stable. When pre-training using real data is not feasible for\nFL, we propose a novel approach to pre-train with synthetic data. On various\nimage datasets (including one for segmentation), our approach with synthetic\npre-training leads to a notable gain, essentially a critical step toward\nscaling up federated learning for real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, high-volume and privacy-sensitive data are generated by mobile\ndevices, which are better to be preserved on devices and queried on demand.\nHowever, data analysts still lack a uniform way to harness such distributed\non-device data. In this paper, we propose a data querying system, Deck, that\nenables flexible device-centric federated analytics. The key idea of Deck is to\nbypass the app developers but allow the data analysts to directly submit their\nanalytics code to run on devices, through a centralized query coordinator\nservice. Deck provides a list of standard APIs to data analysts and handles\nmost of the device-specific tasks underneath. Deck further incorporates two key\ntechniques: (i) a hybrid permission checking mechanism and mandatory\ncross-device aggregation to ensure data privacy; (ii) a zero-knowledge\nstatistical model that judiciously trades off query delay and query resource\nexpenditure on devices. We fully implement Deck and plug it into 20 popular\nAndroid apps. An in-the-wild deployment on 1,642 volunteers shows that Deck\nsignificantly reduces the query delay by up to 30x compared to baselines. Our\nmicrobenchmarks also demonstrate that the standalone overhead of Deck is\nnegligible.",

While prior approaches have achieved\nsubstantial progress through devising advanced action detectors, they still\nsuffer from these co-occurring ingredients which often dominate the actual\naction content in videos. In this paper, we explore two orthogonal but\ncomplementary aspects of a video snippet, i.e., the action features and the\nco-occurrence features. Especially, we develop a novel auxiliary task by\ndecoupling these two types of features within a video snippet and recombining\nthem to generate a new feature representation with more salient action\ninformation for accurate action localization. We term our method RefactorNet,\nwhich first explicitly factorizes the action content and regularizes its\nco-occurrence features, and then synthesizes a new action-dominated video\nrepresentation.

    "abstract": "Incremental Structure from Motion (ISfM) has been widely used for UAV image\norientation. Its efficiency, however, decreases dramatically due to the\nsequential constraint. Although the divide-and-conquer strategy has been\nutilized for efficiency improvement, cluster merging becomes difficult or\ndepends on seriously designed overlap structures. This paper proposes an\nalgorithm to extract the global model for cluster merging and designs a\nparallel SfM solution to achieve efficient and accurate UAV image orientation.\nFirst, based on vocabulary tree retrieval, match pairs are selected to\nconstruct an undirected weighted match graph, whose edge weights are calculated\nby considering both the number and distribution of feature matches. Second, an\nalgorithm, termed weighted connected dominating set (WCDS), is designed to\nachieve the simplification of the match graph and build the global model, which\nincorporates the edge weight in the graph node selection and enables the\nsuccessful reconstruction of the global model. Third, the match graph is\nsimultaneously divided into compact and non-overlapped clusters. After the\nparallel reconstruction, cluster merging is conducted with the aid of common 3D\npoints between the global and cluster models. Finally, by using three UAV\ndatasets that are captured by classical oblique and recent optimized views\nphotogrammetry, the validation of the proposed solution is verified through\ncomprehensive analysis and comparison. The experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed parallel SfM can achieve 17.4 times efficiency improvement\nand comparative orientation accuracy. In absolute BA, the geo-referencing\naccuracy is approximately 2.0 and 3.0 times the GSD (Ground Sampling Distance)\nvalue in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. For parallel\nSfM, the proposed solution is a more reliable alternative.",

Leader-election oracles are known to be\ninstrumental in designing efficient consensus protocols, and one can expect\nthat secret leader election may help in developing long-lived blockchain\nsystems that are secure with respect to the adaptive adversary. In this paper,\nwe introduce secret leader sortition (SLS) that we believe to perfectly match\nprogress and security expectations of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains. An SLS\nprotocol produces an unpredictable permutation of system members that can be\nfed to an accompanying blockchain protocol in order to ensure deterministic\nfinality.

An interesting novelty of our protocol is\na cryptographic hash function evaluation under ThFHE and, somewhat\nsurprisingly, we show that all ThFHE stimuli required for our protocol can be\nefficiently and proactively constructed in a parallelizable fashion. In\ncontrast to existing secret leader election protocols, our SLS solution is\npurely asynchronous and it fairly leverages the stake distribution among the\nsystem members: the probability distribution for each position in the\npermutation is proportional to the stakes of remaining candidates.

A challenge is that most existing causal effects cannot\nbe estimated from data without a known causal graph. In this paper, we define\nan explanatory causal effect based on a hypothetical ideal experiment. The\ndefinition brings several benefits to model agnostic explanations. First,\nexplanations are transparent and have causal meanings. Second, the explanatory\ncausal effect estimation can be data driven. Third, the causal effects provide\nboth a local explanation for a specific prediction and a global explanation\nshowing the overall importance of a feature in a predictive model. We further\npropose a method using individual and combined variables based on explanatory\ncausal effects for explanations. We show the definition and the method work\nwith experiments on some real-world data sets.",

    "abstract": "Space exploration has witnessed revolutionary changes upon landing of the\nPerseverance Rover on the Martian surface and demonstrating the first flight\nbeyond Earth by the Mars helicopter, Ingenuity. During their mission on Mars,\nPerseverance Rover and Ingenuity collaboratively explore the Martian surface,\nwhere Ingenuity scouts terrain information for rover's safe traversability.\nHence, determining the relative poses between both the platforms is of\nparamount importance for the success of this mission. Driven by this necessity,\nthis work proposes a robust relative localization system based on a fusion of\nneuromorphic vision-based measurements (NVBMs) and inertial measurements. The\nemergence of neuromorphic vision triggered a paradigm shift in the computer\nvision community, due to its unique working principle delineated with\nasynchronous events triggered by variations of light intensities occurring in\nthe scene. This implies that observations cannot be acquired in static scenes\ndue to illumination invariance. To circumvent this limitation, high frequency\nactive landmarks are inserted in the scene to guarantee consistent event\nfiring. These landmarks are adopted as salient features to facilitate relative\nlocalization. A novel event-based landmark identification algorithm using\nGaussian Mixture Models (GMM) is developed for matching the landmarks\ncorrespondences formulating our NVBMs. The NVBMs are fused with inertial\nmeasurements in proposed state estimators, landmark tracking Kalman filter\n(LTKF) and translation decoupled Kalman filter (TDKF) for landmark tracking and\nrelative localization, respectively. The proposed system was tested in a\nvariety of experiments and has outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in\naccuracy and range.",

    "abstract": "The recently proposed Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) paradigm has\naroused wide interest in the area of recommendation systems (RS) owing to its\nsimplicity and effectiveness. Typically, the existing literature of CML depends\nlargely on the \\textit{negative sampling} strategy to alleviate the\ntime-consuming burden of pairwise computation. However, in this work, by taking\na theoretical analysis, we find that negative sampling would lead to a biased\nestimation of the generalization error. Specifically, we show that the\nsampling-based CML would introduce a bias term in the generalization bound,\nwhich is quantified by the per-user \\textit{Total Variance} (TV) between the\ndistribution induced by negative sampling and the ground truth distribution.\nThis suggests that optimizing the sampling-based CML loss function does not\nensure a small generalization error even with sufficiently large training data.\nMoreover, we show that the bias term will vanish without the negative sampling\nstrategy. Motivated by this, we propose an efficient alternative without\nnegative sampling for CML named \\textit{Sampling-Free Collaborative Metric\nLearning} (SFCML), to get rid of the sampling bias in a practical sense.\nFinally, comprehensive experiments over seven benchmark datasets speak to the\nsuperiority of the proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "User-based KNN recommender systems (UserKNN) utilize the rating data of a\ntarget user's k nearest neighbors in the recommendation process. This, however,\nincreases the privacy risk of the neighbors since their rating data might be\nexposed to other users or malicious parties. To reduce this risk, existing work\napplies differential privacy by adding randomness to the neighbors' ratings,\nwhich reduces the accuracy of UserKNN. In this work, we introduce ReuseKNN, a\nnovel privacy-aware recommender system. The main idea is to identify small but\nhighly reusable neighborhoods so that (i) only a minimal set of users requires\nprotection with differential privacy, and (ii) most users do not need to be\nprotected with differential privacy, since they are only rarely exploited as\nneighbors. In our experiments on five diverse datasets, we make two key\nobservations: Firstly, ReuseKNN requires significantly smaller neighborhoods,\nand thus, fewer neighbors need to be protected with differential privacy\ncompared to traditional UserKNN. Secondly, despite the small neighborhoods,\nReuseKNN outperforms UserKNN and a fully differentially private approach in\nterms of accuracy. Overall, ReuseKNN's recommendation process leads to\nsignificantly less privacy risk for users than in the case of UserKNN",

They are the\nnon-convex energy functional, variational inequality due to fracture\nirreversibility, the need for extremely fine meshes to resolve the fracture. In\nthis manuscript, the focus is on the numerical treatment of variational\ninequality. In this context, the popular history-variable approach suffers from\nvariationally inconsistency and non-quantifiable nature of the error\nintroduced. A better alternative, the penalisation approach, has the potential\nto render the stiffness matrix ill-conditioned. In order to circumvent both\naforementioned issues, a micromorphic approach towards phase-field fracture\nmodelling is proposed in this manuscript. Within this approach, a micromorphic\nextension of the energy functional is carried out. This transforms the\nphase-field into a local variable, while introducing a micromorphic variable\nthat regularises the fracture problem. This reduction the regularity\nrequirements for the phase-field enables an easier implementation of the\nfracture irreversibility constraint through simple 'max' operation, with system\nlevel precision.

This makes the demand for reliable cyber risk assessment tools\ncontinuously increasing, especially concerning quantitative tools based on\nstatistical approaches. Probabilistic cyber risk assessment methods, however,\nfollow the general paradigm of probabilistic risk assessment, which requires\nthe magnitude and the likelihood of incidents as inputs. Unfortunately, for\ncyber incidents, the likelihood of occurrence is hard to estimate based on\nhistorical and publicly available data; so, expert evaluations are commonly\nused, which however leave space to subjectivity. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel probabilistic model, called MAGIC (Method for AssessinG cyber Incidents\noCcurrence), to compute the likelihood of occurrence of a cyber incident, based\non the evaluation of the cyber posture of the target organization. This allows\nderiving tailor-made inputs for probabilistic risk assessment methods, like\nHTMA (How To Measure Anything in cybersecurity risk), FAIR (Factor Analysis of\nInformation Risk) and others, thus considerably reducing the margin of\nsubjectivity in the assessment of cyber risk.

    "title": "Learning Towards the Largest Margins",
    "abstract": "One of the main challenges for feature representation in deep learning-based\nclassification is the design of appropriate loss functions that exhibit strong\ndiscriminative power. The classical softmax loss does not explicitly encourage\ndiscriminative learning of features. A popular direction of research is to\nincorporate margins in well-established losses in order to enforce extra\nintra-class compactness and inter-class separability, which, however, were\ndeveloped through heuristic means, as opposed to rigorous mathematical\nprinciples. In this work, we attempt to address this limitation by formulating\nthe principled optimization objective as learning towards the largest margins.\nSpecifically, we firstly define the class margin as the measure of inter-class\nseparability, and the sample margin as the measure of intra-class compactness.\nAccordingly, to encourage discriminative representation of features, the loss\nfunction should promote the largest possible margins for both classes and\nsamples. Furthermore, we derive a generalized margin softmax loss to draw\ngeneral conclusions for the existing margin-based losses. Not only does this\nprincipled framework offer new perspectives to understand and interpret\nexisting margin-based losses, but it also provides new insights that can guide\nthe design of new tools, including sample margin regularization and largest\nmargin softmax loss for the class-balanced case, and zero-centroid\nregularization for the class-imbalanced case. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our strategy on a variety of tasks, including visual\nclassification, imbalanced classification, person re-identification, and face\nverification.",

    "abstract": "Proximal humerus impacted fractures are of clinical concern in the elderly\npopulation. Prediction of such fractures by CT-based finite element methods\nencounters several major obstacles such as heterogeneous mechanical properties\nand fracture due to compressive strains. We herein propose to investigate a\nvariation of the phase field method (PFM) embedded into the finite cell method\n(FCM) to simulate impacted humeral fractures in fresh frozen human humeri. The\nforce-strain response, failure loads and the fracture path are compared to\nexperimental observations for validation purposes. The PFM (by means of the\nregularization parameter $l_0$) is first calibrated by one experiment and\nthereafter used for the prediction of the mechanical response of two other\nhuman fresh frozen humeri. All humeri are fractured at the surgical neck and\nstrains are monitored by Digital Image Correlation (DIC). Experimental strains\nin the elastic regime are reproduced with good agreement ($R^2 = 0.726$),\nsimilarly to the validated finite element method [9]. The failure pattern and\nfracture evolution at the surgical neck predicted by the PFM mimic extremely\nwell the experimental observations for all three humeri. The maximum relative\nerror in the computed failure loads is $3.8\\%$.

We propose a simple,\neffective way of disentangling representations without any need to train\nadversarial discriminators, and apply our approach to Restricted Boltzmann\nMachines (RBM), one of the simplest representation-based generative models.

The effectiveness of the approach is\nillustrated on the MNIST dataset, the two-dimensional Ising model, and taxonomy\nof protein families.

Research shows that emotional intelligence (EI) should be used\nalongside agility and cognitive intelligence during RC handling. Objective: We\nwanted to study the role of EI in-depth during RC handling. Method: We\nconducted a socio-technical grounded theory study with eighteen software\npractitioners from Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Sri Lanka. Findings:\nWe found causal condition (software practitioners handling RCs), intervening\ncondition (mode of work), causes (being aware of own emotions, being aware of\nothers' emotions), direct consequences (regulating own emotions, managing\nrelationships), extended consequences (sustaining productivity, setting and\nsustaining team goals), and contingencies: strategies (open and regular\ncommunication, tracking commitments and issues, and ten other strategies) of\nusing EI during RC handling. We also found the covariances where strategies\nco-vary with the causes and direct consequences, and ease/ difficulty in\nexecuting strategies co-vary with the intervening condition. Conclusion: Open\nand regular communication is key to EI during RC handling. To the best of our\nknowledge, the framework we present in this paper is the first theoretical\nframework on EI in Software Engineering research.

In a recent work, we established NP-hardness of\napproximating the average size of an independent set utilizing hardness of the\ncorresponding optimization problem and the related phase transition behavior.\nHere, we instead consider settings where the underlying optimization problem is\neasily solvable. Our main contribution is to classify the complexity of\napproximating a wide class of observables via a generic reduction from\napproximate counting to the problem of estimating local observables. The key\nidea is to use the observables to interpolate the counting problem.\nUsing this new approach, we are able to study observables on bipartite graphs\nwhere the underlying optimization problem is easy but the counting problem is\nbelieved to be hard. The most-well studied class of graphs that was excluded\nfrom previous hardness results were bipartite graphs. We establish hardness for\nestimating the average size of the independent set in bipartite graphs of\nmaximum degree 6; more generally, we show tight hardness results for general\nvertex-edge observables for antiferromagnetic 2-spin systems on bipartite\ngraphs.

    "abstract": "This report presents the methods of the winning entry of the RxR-Habitat\nCompetition in CVPR 2022. The competition addresses the problem of\nVision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE), which\nrequires an agent to follow step-by-step natural language instructions to reach\na target. We present a modular plan-and-control approach for the task. Our\nmodel consists of three modules: the candidate waypoints predictor (CWP), the\nhistory enhanced planner and the tryout controller. In each decision loop, CWP\nfirst predicts a set of candidate waypoints based on depth observations from\nmultiple views. It can reduce the complexity of the action space and facilitate\nplanning. Then, a history-enhanced planner is adopted to select one of the\ncandidate waypoints as the subgoal. The planner additionally encodes historical\nmemory to track the navigation progress, which is especially effective for\nlong-horizon navigation. Finally, we propose a non-parametric heuristic\ncontroller named tryout to execute low-level actions to reach the planned\nsubgoal. It is based on the trial-and-error mechanism which can help the agent\nto avoid obstacles and escape from getting stuck. All three modules work\nhierarchically until the agent stops. We further take several recent advances\nof Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to improve the performance such as\npretraining based on large-scale synthetic in-domain dataset, environment-level\ndata augmentation and snapshot model ensemble. Our model won the RxR-Habitat\nCompetition 2022, with 48% and 90% relative improvements over existing methods\non NDTW and SR metrics respectively.",

To analyze the health consumer-generated content\n(HCGC) from the OHCs, identifying the colloquial medical expressions used by\nlaypeople is a critical challenge. The open-access and collaborative consumer\nhealth vocabulary (OAC CHV) is the controlled vocabulary for addressing such a\nchallenge. Nevertheless, OAC CHV is only available in English, limiting the\napplicability to other languages. This research aims to propose a cross-lingual\nautomatic term recognition framework for extending the English OAC CHV into a\ncross-lingual one. Our framework requires an English HCGC corpus and a\nnon-English (i.e., Chinese in this study) HCGC corpus as inputs. Two\nmonolingual word vector spaces are determined using skip-gram algorithm so that\neach space encodes common word associations from laypeople within a language.\nBased on isometry assumption, the framework align two monolingual spaces into a\nbilingual word vector space, where we employ cosine similarity as a metric for\nidentifying semantically similar words across languages. In the experiments,\nour framework demonstrates that it can effectively retrieve similar medical\nterms, including colloquial expressions, across languages and further\nfacilitate compilation of cross-lingual CHV.",

    "abstract": "For soft robots to work effectively in human-centered environments, they need\nto be able to estimate their state and external interactions based on\n(proprioceptive) sensors. Estimating disturbances allows a soft robot to\nperform desirable force control. Even in the case of rigid manipulators, force\nestimation at the end-effector is seen as a non-trivial problem. And indeed,\nother current approaches to address this challenge have shortcomings that\nprevent their general application. They are often based on simplified soft\ndynamic models, such as the ones relying on a piece-wise constant curvature\n(PCC) approximation or matched rigid-body models that do not represent enough\ndetails of the problem. Thus, the applications needed for complex human-robot\ninteraction can not be built. Finite element methods (FEM) allow for\npredictions of soft robot dynamics in a more generic fashion. Here, using the\nsoft robot modeling capabilities of the framework SOFA, we build a detailed FEM\nmodel of a multi-segment soft continuum robotic arm composed of compliant\ndeformable materials and fiber-reinforced pressurized actuation chambers with a\nmodel for sensors that provide orientation output. This model is used to\nestablish a state observer for the manipulator. Model parameters were\ncalibrated to match imperfections of the manual fabrication process using\nphysical experiments. We then solve a quadratic programming inverse dynamics\nproblem to compute the components of external force that explain the pose\nerror. Our experiments show an average force estimation error of around 1.2%.\nAs the methods proposed are generic, these results are encouraging for the task\nof building soft robots exhibiting complex, reactive, sensor-based behavior\nthat can be deployed in human-centered environments.",

    "abstract": "Formants are the spectral maxima that result from acoustic resonances of the\nhuman vocal tract, and their accurate estimation is among the most fundamental\nspeech processing problems. Recent work has been shown that those frequencies\ncan accurately be estimated using deep learning techniques. However, when\npresented with a speech from a different domain than that in which they have\nbeen trained on, these methods exhibit a decline in performance, limiting their\nusage as generic tools.\nThe contribution of this paper is to propose a new network architecture that\nperforms well on a variety of different speaker and speech domains. Our\nproposed model is composed of a shared encoder that gets as input a spectrogram\nand outputs a domain-invariant representation. Then, multiple decoders further\nprocess this representation, each responsible for predicting a different\nformant while considering the lower formant predictions. An advantage of our\nmodel is that it is based on heatmaps that generate a probability distribution\nover formant predictions. Results suggest that our proposed model better\nrepresents the signal over various domains and leads to better formant\nfrequency tracking and estimation.",

    "abstract": "The structure of the graph defined by the interactions in a Boolean network\ncan determine properties of the asymptotic dynamics. For instance, considering\nthe asynchronous dynamics, the absence of positive cycles guarantees the\nexistence of a unique attractor, and the absence of negative cycles ensures\nthat all attractors are fixed points. In presence of multiple attractors, one\nmight be interested in properties that ensure that attractors are sufficiently\n\"isolated\", that is, they can be found in separate subspaces or even trap\nspaces, subspaces that are closed with respect to the dynamics. Here we\nintroduce notions of separability for attractors and identify corresponding\nnecessary conditions on the interaction graph. In particular, we show that if\nthe interaction graph has at most one positive cycle, or at most one negative\ncycle, or if no positive cycle intersects a negative cycle, then the attractors\ncan be separated by subspaces. If the interaction graph has no path from a\nnegative to a positive cycle, then the attractors can be separated by trap\nspaces. Furthermore, we study networks with interaction graphs admitting two\nvertices that intersect all cycles, and show that if their attractors cannot be\nseparated by subspaces, then their interaction graph must contain a copy of the\ncomplete signed digraph on two vertices, deprived of a negative loop. We thus\nestablish a connection between a dynamical property and a complex network\nmotif. The topic is far from exhausted and we conclude by stating some open\nquestions.",

    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks have proven to be a powerful tool for\nlearning complex and high-dimensional data distributions, but issues such as\nmode collapse have been shown to make it difficult to train them. This is an\neven harder problem when the data is decentralized over several clients in a\nfederated learning setup, as problems such as client drift and non-iid data\nmake it hard for federated averaging to converge.\nIn this work, we study the task of how to learn a data distribution when\ntraining data is heterogeneously decentralized over clients and cannot be\nshared. Our goal is to sample from this distribution centrally, while the data\nnever leaves the clients. We show using standard benchmark image datasets that\nexisting approaches fail in this setting, experiencing so-called client drift\nwhen the local number of epochs becomes to large. We thus propose a novel\napproach we call EFFGAN: Ensembles of fine-tuned federated GANs. Being an\nensemble of local expert generators, EFFGAN is able to learn the data\ndistribution over all clients and mitigate client drift. It is able to train\nwith a large number of local epochs, making it more communication efficient\nthan previous works.",

    "abstract": "Reductions in natural frequency are often used as a damage indicator for\nstructural health monitoring (SHM) purposes. However, fluctuations in\noperational and environmental conditions, changes in boundary conditions, and\nslight differences among nominally-identical structures can also affect\nstiffness, producing frequency changes that mimic or mask damage. This\nvariability has limited the practical implementation and generalisation of SHM\ntechnologies. The aim of this work is to investigate the effects of normal\nvariation, and to identify methods that account for the resulting uncertainty.\nThis work considers vibration data collected from a set of four healthy\nfull-scale composite helicopter blades. The blades were nominally-identical but\ndistinct, and slight differences in material properties and geometry among the\nblades caused significant variability in the frequency response functions,\nwhich presented as four separate trajectories across the input space. In this\npaper, an overlapping mixture of Gaussian processes (OMGP), was used to\ngenerate labels and quantify the uncertainty of normal-condition frequency\nresponse data from the helicopter blades. Using a population-based approach,\nthe OMGP model provided a generic representation, called a form, to\ncharacterise the normal condition of the blades. Additional simulated data were\nthen compared against the form and evaluated for damage using a\nmarginal-likelihood novelty index.",

    "abstract": "Inferring tie strengths in social networks is an essential task in social\nnetwork analysis. Common approaches classify the ties as weak and strong ties\nbased on the strong triadic closure (STC). The STC states that if for three\nnodes, $A$, $B$, and $C$, there are strong ties between $A$ and $B$, as well as\n$A$ and $C$, there has to be a (weak or strong) tie between $B$ and $C$. So\nfar, most works discuss the STC in static networks. However, modern large-scale\nsocial networks are usually highly dynamic, providing user contacts and\ncommunications as streams of edge updates. Temporal networks capture these\ndynamics. To apply the STC to temporal networks, we first generalize the STC\nand introduce a weighted version such that empirical a priori knowledge given\nin the form of edge weights is respected by the STC. The weighted STC is hard\nto compute, and our main contribution is an efficient 2-approximative streaming\nalgorithm for the weighted STC in temporal networks. As a technical\ncontribution, we introduce a fully dynamic 2-approximation for the minimum\nweight vertex cover problem, which is a crucial component of our streaming\nalgorithm. Our evaluation shows that the weighted STC leads to solutions that\ncapture the a priori knowledge given by the edge weights better than the\nnon-weighted STC. Moreover, we show that our streaming algorithm efficiently\napproximates the weighted STC in large-scale social networks.",

Considering the growing concern of data\nprivacy, federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted to train STLF models\nfor utility companies (UCs) in recent research. Inspiringly, in wholesale\nmarkets, as it is not realistic for power plants (PPs) to access UCs' data\ndirectly, FL is definitely a feasible solution of obtaining an accurate STLF\nmodel for PPs. However, due to FL's distributed nature and intense competition\namong UCs, defects increasingly occur and lead to poor performance of the STLF\nmodel, indicating that simply adopting FL is not enough. In this paper, we\npropose a DRL-assisted FL approach, DEfect-AwaRe federated soft actor-critic\n(DearFSAC), to robustly train an accurate STLF model for PPs to forecast\nprecise short-term utility electricity demand. Firstly. we design a STLF model\nbased on long short-term memory (LSTM) using just historical load data and time\ndata. Furthermore, considering the uncertainty of defects occurrence, a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is adopted to assist FL by alleviating\nmodel degradation caused by defects. In addition, for faster convergence of FL\ntraining, an auto-encoder is designed for both dimension reduction and quality\nevaluation of uploaded models. In the simulations, we validate our approach on\nreal data of Helsinki's UCs in 2019. The results show that DearFSAC outperforms\nall the other approaches no matter if defects occur or not.",

Recently, they have\nbeen used for the task of anomaly detection in the visual domain. By optimising\nfor the reconstruction error using anomaly-free examples, the common belief is\nthat a trained network will have difficulties to reconstruct anomalous parts\nduring the test phase. This is usually done by controlling the capacity of the\nnetwork by either reducing the size of the bottleneck layer or enforcing\nsparsity constraints on its activations. However, neither of these techniques\ndoes explicitly penalise reconstruction of anomalous signals often resulting in\na poor detection.

    "abstract": "The Longest Common Subsequence Problem (LCS) deals with finding the longest\nsubsequence among a given set of strings. The LCS problem is an NP-hard problem\nwhich makes it a target for lots of effort to find a better solution with\nheuristics methods. The baseline for most famous heuristics functions is a\ntabular random, probabilistic approach. This approach approximates the length\nof the LCS in each iteration. The combination of beam search and tabular\nprobabilistic-based heuristics has led to a large number of proposals and\nachievements in algorithms for solving the LCS problem. In this work, we\nintroduce a closed-form equation of the probabilistic table calculation for the\nfirst time. Moreover, we present other corresponding forms of the closed-form\nequation and prove all of them. The closed-form equation opens new ways for\nanalysis and further approximations. Using the theorems and beam search, we\npropose an analytic method for estimating the length of the LCS of the\nremaining subsequence. Furthermore, we present another heuristic function based\non the Coefficient of Variation. The results show that our proposed methods\noutperform the state-of-the-art methods on the LCS problem.",

    "abstract": "Federated recommender system (FRS), which enables many local devices to train\na shared model jointly without transmitting local raw data, has become a\nprevalent recommendation paradigm with privacy-preserving advantages. However,\nprevious work on FRS performs similarity search via inner product in continuous\nembedding space, which causes an efficiency bottleneck when the scale of items\nis extremely large. We argue that such a scheme in federated settings ignores\nthe limited capacities in resource-constrained user devices (i.e., storage\nspace, computational overhead, and communication bandwidth), and makes it\nharder to be deployed in large-scale recommender systems. Besides, it has been\nshown that the transmission of local gradients in real-valued form between\nserver and clients may leak users' private information. To this end, we propose\na lightweight federated recommendation framework with privacy-preserving matrix\nfactorization, LightFR, that is able to generate high-quality binary codes by\nexploiting learning to hash techniques under federated settings, and thus\nenjoys both fast online inference and economic memory consumption. Moreover, we\ndevise an efficient federated discrete optimization algorithm to\ncollaboratively train model parameters between the server and clients, which\ncan effectively prevent real-valued gradient attacks from malicious parties.\nThrough extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, we show that our\nLightFR model outperforms several state-of-the-art FRS methods in terms of\nrecommendation accuracy, inference efficiency and data privacy.",

    "abstract": "Recently, animal pose estimation is attracting increasing interest from the\nacademia (e.g., wildlife and conservation biology) focusing on animal behavior\nunderstanding. However, currently animal pose estimation suffers from small\ndatasets and large data variances, making it difficult to obtain robust\nperformance. To tackle this problem, we propose that the rich knowledge about\nrelations between pose-related semantics learned by language models can be\nutilized to improve the animal pose estimation. Therefore, in this study, we\nintroduce a novel PromptPose framework to effectively apply language models for\nbetter understanding the animal poses based on prompt training. In PromptPose,\nwe propose that adapting the language knowledge to the visual animal poses is\nkey to achieve effective animal pose estimation. To this end, we first\nintroduce textual prompts to build connections between textual semantic\ndescriptions and supporting animal keypoint features. Moreover, we further\ndevise a pixel-level contrastive loss to build dense connections between\ntextual descriptions and local image features, as well as a semantic-level\ncontrastive loss to bridge the gap between global contrasts in language-image\ncross-modal pre-training and local contrasts in dense prediction. In practice,\nthe PromptPose has shown great benefits for improving animal pose estimation.\nBy conducting extensive experiments, we show that our PromptPose achieves\nsuperior performance under both supervised and few-shot settings, outperforming\nrepresentative methods by a large margin.

Despite the recent advances in 3D virtual try-on\nsolutions, such approaches still remain limited to a very narrow - if not only\na handful - selection of articles, and often for only one size of those fashion\nitems. Other state-of-the-art approaches that aim to support customers find\nwhat fits them online mostly require a high level of customer engagement and\nprivacy-sensitive data (such as height, weight, age, gender, belly shape,\netc.), or alternatively need images of customers' bodies in tight clothing.\nThey also often lack the ability to produce fit and shape aware visual guidance\nat scale, coming up short by simply advising which size to order that would\nbest match a customer's physical body attributes, without providing any\ninformation on how the garment may fit and look. Contributing towards taking a\nleap forward and surpassing the limitations of current approaches, we present\nFitGAN, a generative adversarial model that explicitly accounts for garments'\nentangled size and fit characteristics of online fashion at scale. Conditioned\non the fit and shape of the articles, our model learns disentangled item\nrepresentations and generates realistic images reflecting the true fit and\nshape properties of fashion articles.

The resulting hardware implementations are\nquantized, configurable, spatial dataflow architectures tailored for speed and\nefficiency and introduce new generic optimizations and common workflows\ndeveloped as a part of this work. The full workflow is presented from\nquantization-aware training to FPGA implementation. The solutions are deployed\non system-on-chip (Pynq-Z2) and pure FPGA (Arty A7-100T) platforms. The\nresulting submissions achieve latencies as low as 20 $\\mu$s and energy\nconsumption as low as 30 $\\mu$J per inference. We demonstrate how emerging ML\nbenchmarks on heterogeneous hardware platforms can catalyze collaboration and\nthe development of new techniques and more accessible tools.",

    "abstract": "Copy detection patterns (CDP) are an attractive technology that allows\nmanufacturers to defend their products against counterfeiting. The main\nassumption behind the protection mechanism of CDP is that these codes printed\nwith the smallest symbol size (1x1) on an industrial printer cannot be copied\nor cloned with sufficient accuracy due to data processing inequality. However,\nprevious works have shown that Machine Learning (ML) based attacks can produce\nhigh-quality fakes, resulting in decreased accuracy of authentication based on\ntraditional feature-based authentication systems. While Deep Learning (DL) can\nbe used as a part of the authentication system, to the best of our knowledge,\nnone of the previous works has studied the performance of a DL-based\nauthentication system against ML-based attacks on CDP with 1x1 symbol size.

    "abstract": "Pretraining on noisy, internet-scale datasets has been heavily studied as a\ntechnique for training models with broad, general capabilities for text,\nimages, and other modalities. However, for many sequential decision domains\nsuch as robotics, video games, and computer use, publicly available data does\nnot contain the labels required to train behavioral priors in the same way. We\nextend the internet-scale pretraining paradigm to sequential decision domains\nthrough semi-supervised imitation learning wherein agents learn to act by\nwatching online unlabeled videos. Specifically, we show that with a small\namount of labeled data we can train an inverse dynamics model accurate enough\nto label a huge unlabeled source of online data -- here, online videos of\npeople playing Minecraft -- from which we can then train a general behavioral\nprior. Despite using the native human interface (mouse and keyboard at 20Hz),\nwe show that this behavioral prior has nontrivial zero-shot capabilities and\nthat it can be fine-tuned, with both imitation learning and reinforcement\nlearning, to hard-exploration tasks that are impossible to learn from scratch\nvia reinforcement learning.

    "abstract": "Data diversity and volume are crucial to the success of training deep\nlearning models, while in the medical imaging field, the difficulty and cost of\ndata collection and annotation are especially huge. Specifically in robotic\nsurgery, data scarcity and imbalance have heavily affected the model accuracy\nand limited the design and deployment of deep learning-based surgical\napplications such as surgical instrument segmentation. Considering this, in\nthis paper, we rethink the surgical instrument segmentation task and propose a\none-to-many data generation solution that gets rid of the complicated and\nexpensive process of data collection and annotation from robotic surgery. In\nour method, we only utilize a single surgical background tissue image and a few\nopen-source instrument images as the seed images and apply multiple\naugmentations and blending techniques to synthesize amounts of image\nvariations. In addition, we also introduce the chained augmentation mixing\nduring training to further enhance the data diversities. The proposed approach\nis evaluated on the real datasets of the EndoVis-2018 and EndoVis-2017 surgical\nscene segmentation. Our empirical analysis suggests that without the high cost\nof data collection and annotation, we can achieve decent surgical instrument\nsegmentation performance. Moreover, we also observe that our method can deal\nwith novel instrument prediction in the deployment domain. We hope our\ninspiring results would encourage researchers to emphasize data-centric methods\nto overcome demanding deep learning limitations besides data shortage, such as\nclass imbalance, domain adaptation, and incremental learning.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the 6D pose for unseen objects is in great demand for many\nreal-world applications. However, current state-of-the-art pose estimation\nmethods can only handle objects that are previously trained. In this paper, we\npropose a new task that enables and facilitates algorithms to estimate the 6D\npose estimation of novel objects during testing. We collect a dataset with both\nreal and synthetic images and up to 48 unseen objects in the test set. In the\nmean while, we propose a new metric named Infimum ADD (IADD) which is an\ninvariant measurement for objects with different types of pose ambiguity. A\ntwo-stage baseline solution for this task is also provided. By training an\nend-to-end 3D correspondences network, our method finds corresponding points\nbetween an unseen object and a partial view RGBD image accurately and\nefficiently. It then calculates the 6D pose from the correspondences using an\nalgorithm robust to object symmetry. Extensive experiments show that our method\noutperforms several intuitive baselines and thus verify its effectiveness. All\nthe data, code and models will be made publicly available.

To\nimprove the classification accuracy, most computer-aided diagnosis algorithms\nrecognize colorectal polyps by adopting Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI). However, the\nNBI usually suffers from missing utilization in real clinic scenarios since the\nacquisition of this specific image requires manual switching of the light mode\nwhen polyps have been detected by using White-Light (WL) images. To avoid the\nabove situation, we propose a novel method to directly achieve accurate\nwhite-light colonoscopy image classification by conducting structured\ncross-modal representation consistency. In practice, a pair of multi-modal\nimages, i.e. NBI and WL, are fed into a shared Transformer to extract\nhierarchical feature representations. Then a novel designed Spatial Attention\nModule (SAM) is adopted to calculate the similarities between the class token\nand patch tokens %from multi-levels for a specific modality image. By aligning\nthe class tokens and spatial attention maps of paired NBI and WL images at\ndifferent levels, the Transformer achieves the ability to keep both global and\nlocal representation consistency for the above two modalities. Extensive\nexperimental results illustrate the proposed method outperforms the recent\nstudies with a margin, realizing multi-modal prediction with a single\nTransformer while greatly improving the classification accuracy when only with\nWL images.",

We can improve on the approximation factor or the dependence on\n$n$ by sacrificing the dependence on $k$.\nOn the other hand, we show the problem of computing tree-partition-width\nexactly is XALP-complete, which implies that it is $W[t]$-hard for all $t$. We\ndeduce XALP-completeness of the problem of computing the domino treewidth.\nFinally, we adapt some known results on the parameter tree-partition-width and\nthe topological minor relation, and use them to compare tree-partition-width to\ntree-cut width.",

    "abstract": "Legal literature on machine learning (ML) tends to focus on harms, and as a\nresult tends to reason about individual model outcomes and summary error rates.\nThis focus on model-level outcomes and errors has masked important aspects of\nML that are rooted in its inherent non-determinism. We show that the effects of\nnon-determinism, and consequently its implications for the law, instead become\nclearer from the perspective of reasoning about ML outputs as probability\ndistributions over possible outcomes. This distributional viewpoint accounts\nfor non-determinism by emphasizing the possible outcomes of ML. Importantly,\nthis type of reasoning is not exclusive with current legal reasoning; it\ncomplements (and in fact can strengthen) analyses concerning individual,\nconcrete outcomes for specific automated decisions. By clarifying the important\nrole of non-determinism, we demonstrate that ML code falls outside of the\ncyberlaw frame of treating \"code as law,\" as this frame assumes that code is\ndeterministic. We conclude with a brief discussion of what work ML can do to\nconstrain the potentially harm-inducing effects of non-determinism, and we\nclarify where the law must do work to bridge the gap between its current\nindividual-outcome focus and the distributional approach that we recommend.",

In this paper, we consider the problem of learning optimal\ndecision trees, a combinatorial optimization problem that is challenging to\nsolve at scale. A common approach in the literature is to use greedy\nheuristics, which may not be optimal. Recently there has been significant\ninterest in learning optimal decision trees using various approaches (e.g.,\nbased on integer programming, dynamic programming) -- to achieve computational\nscalability, most of these approaches focus on classification tasks with binary\nfeatures. In this paper, we present a new discrete optimization method based on\nbranch-and-bound (BnB) to obtain optimal decision trees. Different from\nexisting customized approaches, we consider both regression and classification\ntasks with continuous features. The basic idea underlying our approach is to\nsplit the search space based on the quantiles of the feature distribution --\nleading to upper and lower bounds for the underlying optimization problem along\nthe BnB iterations.

    "abstract": "Blockchain technologies are facing a scalability challenge, which must be\novercome to guarantee a wider adoption of the technology. This scalability\nissue is mostly caused by the use of consensus algorithms to guarantee the\ntotal order of the chain of blocks (and of the operations within each block).\nHowever, total order is often overkilling, since important advanced\napplications of smart-contracts do not require a total order of all the\noperations. Hence, if a more relaxed partial order (instead of a total order)\nis allowed under certain safety conditions, a much higher scalability can be\nachieved. In this paper, we propose a distributed concurrent data type, called\nSetchain, that allows implementing this partial order and increases\nsignificantly blockchain scalability. A Setchain implements a grow-only set\nobject whose elements are not totally ordered, unlike conventional blockchain\noperations. When convenient, the Setchain allows forcing a synchronization\nbarrier that assigns permanently an epoch number to a subset of the latest\nelements added. With the Setchain, operations in the same epoch are not\nordered, while operations in different epochs are. We present different\nByzantine-tolerant implementations of Setchain, prove their correctness and\nreport on an empirical evaluation of a direct implementation. Our results show\nthat Setchain is orders of magnitude faster than consensus-based ledgers to\nimplement grow-only sets with epoch synchronization. Since the Setchain\nbarriers can be synchronized with block consolidation, Setchain objects can be\nused as a sidechain to implement many smart contract solutions with much faster\noperations than on basic blockchains.",

The main challenge is to incrementally learn while avoiding catastrophic\nforgetting, namely the problem of forgetting previously acquired knowledge\nwhile learning from new data. A popular solution in these scenario is to use a\nsmall memory to retain old data and rehearse them over time. Unfortunately, due\nto the limited memory size, the quality of the memory will deteriorate over\ntime. In this paper we propose OLCGM, a novel replay-based continual learning\nstrategy that uses knowledge condensation techniques to continuously compress\nthe memory and achieve a better use of its limited size. The sample\ncondensation step compresses old samples, instead of removing them like other\nreplay strategies. As a result, the experiments show that, whenever the memory\nbudget is limited compared to the complexity of the data, OLCGM improves the\nfinal accuracy compared to state-of-the-art replay strategies.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have a high capacity to completely memorize noisy\nlabels given sufficient training time, and its memorization, unfortunately,\nleads to performance degradation. Recently, virtual adversarial training (VAT)\nattracts attention as it could further improve the generalization of DNNs in\nsemi-supervised learning. The driving force behind VAT is to prevent the models\nfrom overfitting data points by enforcing consistency between the inputs and\nthe perturbed inputs. This strategy could be helpful in learning from noisy\nlabels if it prevents neural models from learning noisy samples while\nencouraging the models to generalize clean samples. In this paper, we propose\ncontext-based virtual adversarial training (ConVAT) to prevent a text\nclassifier from overfitting to noisy labels. Unlike the previous works, the\nproposed method performs the adversarial training at the context level rather\nthan the inputs. It makes the classifier not only learn its label but also its\ncontextual neighbors, which alleviates the learning from noisy labels by\npreserving contextual semantics on each data point. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on four text classification datasets with two types of label\nnoises. Comprehensive experimental results clearly show that the proposed\nmethod works quite well even with extremely noisy settings.",

To deal with this problem, we propose a\nlifelong learning-inspired approach, which allows for fake news detection in\nmultiple languages and the mutual transfer of knowledge acquired in each of\nthem. Both classical feature extractors, such as Term frequency-inverse\ndocument frequency or Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and integrated deep NLP\n(Natural Language Processing) BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers) models paired with MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) classifier, were\nemployed. The results of experiments conducted on two datasets dedicated to the\nfake news classification task (in English and Spanish, respectively), supported\nby statistical analysis, confirmed that utilization of additional languages\ncould improve performance for traditional methods. Also, in some cases\nsupplementing the deep learning method with classical ones can positively\nimpact obtained results. The ability of models to generalize the knowledge\nacquired between the analyzed languages was also observed.",

A natural follow-up\nquestion is, \"how do we choose the right algorithm for a new dataset and\nperformance metric?\" In this work, we start by giving the first large-scale\nstudy of recommender system approaches by comparing 18 algorithms and 100 sets\nof hyperparameters across 85 datasets and 315 metrics. We find that the best\nalgorithms and hyperparameters are highly dependent on the dataset and\nperformance metric, however, there are also strong correlations between the\nperformance of each algorithm and various meta-features of the datasets.\nMotivated by these findings, we create RecZilla, a meta-learning approach to\nrecommender systems that uses a model to predict the best algorithm and\nhyperparameters for new, unseen datasets. By using far more meta-training data\nthan prior work, RecZilla is able to substantially reduce the level of human\ninvolvement when faced with a new recommender system application.

    "abstract": "We study the constrained reinforcement learning problem, in which an agent\naims to maximize the expected cumulative reward subject to a constraint on the\nexpected total value of a utility function. In contrast to existing model-based\napproaches or model-free methods accompanied with a `simulator', we aim to\ndevelop the first model-free, simulator-free algorithm that achieves a\nsublinear regret and a sublinear constraint violation even in large-scale\nsystems. To this end, we consider the episodic constrained Markov decision\nprocesses with linear function approximation, where the transition dynamics and\nthe reward function can be represented as a linear function of some known\nfeature mapping. We show that $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{d^3H^3T})$ regret and\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{d^3H^3T})$ constraint violation bounds can be\nachieved, where $d$ is the dimension of the feature mapping, $H$ is the length\nof the episode, and $T$ is the total number of steps. Our bounds are attained\nwithout explicitly estimating the unknown transition model or requiring a\nsimulator, and they depend on the state space only through the dimension of the\nfeature mapping. Hence our bounds hold even when the number of states goes to\ninfinity. Our main results are achieved via novel adaptations of the standard\nLSVI-UCB algorithms. In particular, we first introduce primal-dual optimization\ninto the LSVI-UCB algorithm to balance between regret and constraint violation.\nMore importantly, we replace the standard greedy selection with respect to the\nstate-action function in LSVI-UCB with a soft-max policy. This turns out to be\nkey in establishing uniform concentration for the constrained case via its\napproximation-smoothness trade-off. We also show that one can achieve an even\nzero constraint violation while still maintaining the same order with respect\nto $T$.",

    "abstract": "State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a\ndeep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs,\nCNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4\nmodel, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range\ndependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While\nthis has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long\ndependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be\ndifficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS\nshowed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still\npreserve the performance of the original model when using a specific\ninitialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to\nsystematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal\nstate space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all\nSSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is\ncritical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing\nthat the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same\nkernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically\ndescribe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs,\nand perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\nOur final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation\nrequires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all\nsettings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical\ntime-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Humans are remarkably flexible in understanding viewpoint changes due to\nvisual cortex supporting the perception of 3D structure. In contrast, most of\nthe computer vision models that learn visual representation from a pool of 2D\nimages often fail to generalize over novel camera viewpoints. Recently, the\nvision architectures have shifted towards convolution-free architectures,\nvisual Transformers, which operate on tokens derived from image patches.\nHowever, neither these Transformers nor 2D convolutional networks perform\nexplicit operations to learn viewpoint-agnostic representation for visual\nunderstanding. To this end, we propose a 3D Token Representation Layer (3DTRL)\nthat estimates the 3D positional information of the visual tokens and leverages\nit for learning viewpoint-agnostic representations. The key elements of 3DTRL\ninclude a pseudo-depth estimator and a learned camera matrix to impose\ngeometric transformations on the tokens. These enable 3DTRL to recover the 3D\npositional information of the tokens from 2D patches. In practice, 3DTRL is\neasily plugged-in into a Transformer.

At the same time, it is known from the neuroscience literature that\nhuman visual system (HVS) is tailored to process asynchronous brightness\nchanges rather than synchronous RGB images, in order to build and continuously\nupdate mental 3D representations of the surroundings for navigation and\nsurvival. Visual sensors that were inspired by HVS principles are event\ncameras. Thus, events are sparse and asynchronous per-pixel brightness (or\ncolour channel) change signals.

Our\nmodels achieve high visual accuracy of the rendered novel views of challenging\nscenes in the RGB space, even though they are trained with substantially fewer\ndata (i.e., event streams from a single event camera moving around the object)\nand more efficiently (due to the inherent sparsity of event streams) than the\nexisting NeRF models trained with RGB images.

    "abstract": "Natural data observed in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is often constrained to an\n$m$-dimensional manifold $\\mathcal{M}$, where $m < n$. Current generative\nmodels represent this manifold by mapping an $m$-dimensional latent variable\nthrough a neural network $f_\\theta: \\mathbb{R}^m \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$. Such\nprocedures, which we call pushforward models, incur a straightforward\nlimitation: manifolds cannot in general be represented with a single\nparameterization, meaning that attempts to do so will incur either\ncomputational instability or the inability to learn probability densities\nwithin the manifold. To remedy this problem, we propose to model $\\mathcal{M}$\nas a neural implicit manifold: the set of zeros of a neural network. To learn\nthe data distribution within $\\mathcal{M}$, we introduce constrained\nenergy-based models, which use a constrained variant of Langevin dynamics to\ntrain and sample within the learned manifold. The resulting model can be\nmanipulated with an arithmetic of manifolds which allows practitioners to take\nunions and intersections of model manifolds. In experiments on synthetic and\nnatural data, we show that constrained EBMs can learn manifold-supported\ndistributions with complex topologies more accurately than pushforward models.",

    "abstract": "Low dimensional and computationally less expensive Reduced-Order Models\n(ROMs) have been widely used to capture the dominant behaviors of\nhigh-dimensional systems. A ROM can be obtained, using the well-known Proper\nOrthogonal Decomposition (POD), by projecting the full-order model to a\nsubspace spanned by modal basis modes which are learned from experimental,\nsimulated or observational data, i.e., training data. However, the optimal\nbasis can change with the parameter settings. When a ROM, constructed using the\nPOD basis obtained from training data, is applied to new parameter settings,\nthe model often lacks robustness against the change of parameters in design,\ncontrol, and other real-time operation problems. This paper proposes to use\nregression trees on Grassmann Manifold to learn the mapping between parameters\nand POD bases that span the low-dimensional subspaces onto which full-order\nmodels are projected. Motivated by the fact that a subspace spanned by a POD\nbasis can be viewed as a point in the Grassmann manifold, we propose to grow a\ntree by repeatedly splitting the tree node to maximize the Riemannian distance\nbetween the two subspaces spanned by the predicted POD bases on the left and\nright daughter nodes. Five numerical examples are presented to comprehensively\ndemonstrate the performance of the proposed method, and compare the proposed\ntree-based method to the existing interpolation method for POD basis and the\nuse of global POD basis. The results show that the proposed tree-based method\nis capable of establishing the mapping between parameters and POD bases, and\nthus adapt ROMs for new parameters.",

This paper proves the convergence of the bi-stochastically\nnormalized graph Laplacian to manifold (weighted-)Laplacian with rates when $n$\ndata points are i.i.d. sampled from a general $d$-dimensional manifold embedded\nin a possibly high-dimensional space. Under certain joint limit of $n \\to\n\\infty$ and kernel bandwidth $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the point-wise convergence rate\nof the graph Laplacian operator (under 2-norm) is proved to be $ O(\nn^{-1/(d/2+3)})$ at finite large $n$ up to log factors, achieved at the scaling\nof $\\epsilon \\sim n^{-1/(d/2+3)} $. When the manifold data are corrupted by\noutlier noise, we theoretically prove the graph Laplacian point-wise\nconsistency which matches the rate for clean manifold data up to an additional\nerror term proportional to the boundedness of mutual inner-products of the\nnoise vectors.

These\nrepresentations, in a lower-dimensional space, extract and compress information\nfrom individual curves. The existing representation learning approaches in\nfunctional data analysis usually use linear mapping in parallel to those from\nmultivariate analysis, e.g., functional principal component analysis (FPCA).\nHowever, functions, as infinite-dimensional objects, sometimes have nonlinear\nstructures that cannot be uncovered by linear mapping. Linear methods will be\nmore overwhelmed given multivariate functional data. For that matter, this\npaper proposes a functional nonlinear learning (FunNoL) method to sufficiently\nrepresent multivariate functional data in a lower-dimensional feature space.\nFurthermore, we merge a classification model for enriching the ability of\nrepresentations in predicting curve labels. Hence, representations from FunNoL\ncan be used for both curve reconstruction and classification. Additionally, we\nhave endowed the proposed model with the ability to address the missing\nobservation problem as well as to further denoise observations. The resulting\nrepresentations are robust to observations that are locally disturbed by\nuncontrollable random noises. We apply the proposed FunNoL method to several\nreal data sets and show that FunNoL can achieve better classifications than\nFPCA, especially in the multivariate functional data setting.

It is highly desirable to assist\nclinicians in optimizing the NPC radiotherapy regimen to reduce\nradiotherapy-induced temporal lobe injury (RTLI) according to the probability\nof REP onset. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first exploration of\npredicting radiotherapy-induced REP by jointly exploiting image and non-image\ndata in NPC radiotherapy regimen. We cast REP prediction as a survival analysis\ntask and evaluate the predictive accuracy in terms of the concordance index\n(CI). We design a deep multimodal survival network (MSN) with two feature\nextractors to learn discriminative features from multimodal data. One feature\nextractor imposes feature selection on non-image data, and the other learns\nvisual features from images. Because the priorly balanced CI (BCI) loss\nfunction directly maximizing the CI is sensitive to uneven sampling per batch.\nHence, we propose a novel weighted CI (WCI) loss function to leverage all REP\nsamples effectively by assigning their different weights with a dual average\noperation. We further introduce a temperature hyper-parameter for our WCI to\nsharpen the risk difference of sample pairs to help model convergence. We\nextensively evaluate our WCI on a private dataset to demonstrate its\nfavourability against its counterparts. The experimental results also show\nmultimodal data of NPC radiotherapy can bring more gains for REP risk\nprediction.",

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning-based generative models have been introduced to\ngenerate singing voices. One approach is to predict the parametric vocoder\nfeatures consisting of explicit speech parameters. This approach has the\nadvantage that the meaning of each feature is explicitly distinguished. Another\napproach is to predict mel-spectrograms for a neural vocoder. However,\nparametric vocoders have limitations of voice quality and the mel-spectrogram\nfeatures are difficult to model because the timbre and pitch information are\nentangled. In this study, we propose a singing voice synthesis model with\nmulti-task learning to use both approaches -- acoustic features for a\nparametric vocoder and mel-spectrograms for a neural vocoder. By using the\nparametric vocoder features as auxiliary features, the proposed model can\nefficiently disentangle and control the timbre and pitch components of the\nmel-spectrogram. Moreover, a generative adversarial network framework is\napplied to improve the quality of singing voices in a multi-singer model.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed model can generate more\nnatural singing voices than the single-task models, while performing better\nthan the conventional parametric vocoder-based model.",

We started with the\n(linearised) well-posedness analysis by [1], where far-field boundary\nconditions were proposed but extended their analysis to include wall\nboundaries. Specifically, high-order Summation-by-parts (SBP) finite-difference\noperators were employed to construct a scheme for the Shallow Water Equations.\nSubsequently, a stable SBP scheme with Simultaneous Approximation Terms that\nimposes both far-field and wall boundaries was developed. Finally, we extended\nthe schemes and their stability proofs to non-cartesian domains. To demonstrate\nthe strength of the schemes, computations for problems with exact solutions\nwere performed and a theoretical design-order with second-, third- and fourth\n(2,3,4) convergence rates obtained. Finally, we apply the 4th-order scheme to\nsteady river channel, canal (or flood control channel simulations), and\ndam-break problems. The results show that the imposition of the boundary\nconditions are stable, and that they cause no visible reflections at the\nboundaries.

Advances in Numerical weather\nprediction (NWP) have been measured by the improvement of forecasts for various\nphysical fields such as temperature and pressure; however, large biases exist\nin precipitation prediction. We augment the output of the well-known NWP model\nCFSv2 with deep learning to create a hybrid model that improves short-range\nglobal precipitation at 1-, 2-, and 3-day lead times. To hybridise, we address\nthe sphericity of the global data by using modified DLWP-CS architecture which\ntransforms all the fields to cubed-sphere projection. Dynamical model\nprecipitation and surface temperature outputs are fed into a modified DLWP-CS\n(UNET) to forecast ground truth precipitation. While CFSv2's average bias is +5\nto +7 mm/day over land, the multivariate deep learning model decreases it to\nwithin -1 to +1 mm/day. Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Hurricane Ivan in 2004,\nChina floods in 2010, India floods in 2005, and Myanmar storm Nargis in 2008\nare used to confirm the substantial enhancement in the skill for the hybrid\ndynamical-deep learning model. CFSv2 typically shows a moderate to large bias\nin the spatial pattern and overestimates the precipitation at short-range time\nscales. The proposed deep learning augmented NWP model can address these biases\nand vastly improve the spatial pattern and magnitude of predicted\nprecipitation. Deep learning enhanced CFSv2 reduces mean bias by 8x over\nimportant land regions for 1 day lead compared to CFSv2.

As input tokens, the model takes a discretised\nencoding of speech from a vector quantised (VQ) neural network with 512 codes.\nThe goal is then to map these 512 VQ codes to 50 phone-like units (topics) in\norder to more closely resemble true phones. In contrast to the base LDA, which\nonly considers how VQ codes co-occur within utterances (documents), the Markov\nchain LDA additionally captures how consecutive codes follow one another. This\nextension leads to an increase in cluster quality and phone segmentation\nresults compared to the base LDA.

In\nneuroscience, it is unclear whether the brain could adopt a similar strategy to\ncorrectly modify its synapses. Recent models have attempted to bridge this gap\nwhile being consistent with a range of experimental observations. However,\nthese models are either unable to effectively backpropagate error signals\nacross multiple layers or require a multi-phase learning process, neither of\nwhich are reminiscent of learning in the brain. Here, we introduce a new model,\nbursting cortico-cortical networks (BurstCCN), which solves these issues by\nintegrating known properties of cortical networks namely bursting activity,\nshort-term plasticity (STP) and dendrite-targeting interneurons. BurstCCN\nrelies on burst multiplexing via connection-type-specific STP to propagate\nbackprop-like error signals within deep cortical networks. These error signals\nare encoded at distal dendrites and induce burst-dependent plasticity as a\nresult of excitatory-inhibitory topdown inputs. First, we demonstrate that our\nmodel can effectively backpropagate errors through multiple layers using a\nsingle-phase learning process. Next, we show both empirically and analytically\nthat learning in our model approximates backprop-derived gradients. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that our model is capable of learning complex image classification\ntasks (MNIST and CIFAR-10). Overall, our results suggest that cortical features\nacross sub-cellular, cellular, microcircuit and systems levels jointly underlie\nsingle-phase efficient deep learning in the brain.",

    "abstract": "We explore the use of machine learning techniques to remove the response of\nlarge volume $\\gamma$-ray detectors from experimental spectra. Segmented\n$\\gamma$-ray total absorption spectrometers (TAS) allow for the simultaneous\nmeasurement of individual $\\gamma$-ray energy (E$_\\gamma$) and total excitation\nenergy (E$_x$). Analysis of TAS detector data is complicated by the fact that\nthe E$_x$ and E$_\\gamma$ quantities are correlated, and therefore, techniques\nthat simply unfold using E$_x$ and E$_\\gamma$ response functions independently\nare not as accurate. In this work, we investigate the use of conditional\ngenerative adversarial networks (cGANs) to simultaneously unfold $E_{x}$ and\n$E_{\\gamma}$ data in TAS detectors. Specifically, we employ a Pix2Pix cGAN, a\ngenerative modeling technique based on recent advances in deep learning, to\ntreat $(E_x, E_{\\gamma})$ matrix unfolding as an image-to-image translation\nproblem. We present results for simulated and experimental matrices of\nsingle-$\\gamma$ and double-$\\gamma$ decay cascades.

    "abstract": "Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) is a set of distribution-free and model\nagnostic algorithms devised to predict with a user-defined confidence with\ncoverage guarantee. Instead of having \\textit{point predictions}, i.e., a real\nnumber in the case of regression or a single class in multi class\nclassification, models calibrated using ICP output an interval or a set of\nclasses, respectively. ICP takes special importance in high-risk settings where\nwe want the real output to belong to the prediction set with high probability.\nAs an example, a classification model might output that given a magnetic\nresonance image a patient has no latent diseases to report. However, this model\noutput was based on the most likely class, the second most likely class might\ntell that the patient has a 15\\% chance of brain tumor or other severe disease\nand therefore further exams should be conducted. Using ICP is therefore way\nmore informative and we believe that should be the standard way of producing\nforecasts. This paper is a hands-on introduction, this means that we will\nprovide examples as we introduce the theory.",

    "abstract": "A variety of optimization problems takes the form of a minimum norm\noptimization. In this paper, we study the change of optimal values between two\nincrementally constructed least norm optimization problems, with new\nmeasurements included in the second one. We prove an exact equation to\ncalculate the change of optimal values in the linear least norm optimization\nproblem. With the result in this paper, the change of the optimal values can be\npre-calculated as a metric to guide online decision makings, without solving\nthe second optimization problem as long the solution and covariance of the\nfirst optimization problem are available. The result can be extended to linear\nleast distance optimization problems, and nonlinear least distance optimization\nwith (nonlinear) equality constraints through linearizations. This derivation\nin this paper provides a theoretically sound explanation to the empirical\nobservations shown in RA-L 2018 bai et al. As an additional contribution, we\npropose another optimization problem, i.e. aligning two trajectories at given\nposes, to further demonstrate how to use the metric. The accuracy of the metric\nis validated with numerical examples, which is quite satisfactory in general\n(see the experiments in RA-L 2018 bai et al.} as well), unless in some\nextremely adverse scenarios. Last but not least, calculating the optimal value\nby the proposed metric is at least one magnitude faster than solving the\ncorresponding optimization problems directly.",

    "abstract": "Heavy Ball (HB) nowadays is one of the most popular momentum methods in\nnon-convex optimization. It has been widely observed that incorporating the\nHeavy Ball dynamic in gradient-based methods accelerates the training process\nof modern machine learning models. However, the progress on establishing its\ntheoretical foundation of acceleration is apparently far behind its empirical\nsuccess. Existing provable acceleration results are of the quadratic or\nclose-to-quadratic functions, as the current techniques of showing HB's\nacceleration are limited to the case when the Hessian is fixed. In this work,\nwe develop some new techniques that help show acceleration beyond quadratics,\nwhich is achieved by analyzing how the change of the Hessian at two consecutive\ntime points affects the convergence speed. Based on our technical results, a\nclass of Polyak-\\L{}ojasiewicz (PL) optimization problems for which provable\nacceleration can be achieved via HB is identified. Moreover, our analysis\ndemonstrates a benefit of adaptively setting the momentum parameter.",

    "abstract": "Sustained high levels of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) can have\ndisastrous long-term health consequences. An essential component of clinical\ninterventions for T2DM is monitoring dietary intake to keep plasma glucose\nlevels within an acceptable range. Yet, current techniques to monitor food\nintake are time intensive and error prone. To address this issue, we are\ndeveloping techniques to automatically monitor food intake and the composition\nof those foods using continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). This article presents\nthe results of a clinical study in which participants consumed nine\nstandardized meals with known macronutrients amounts (carbohydrate, protein,\nand fat) while wearing a CGM. We built a multitask neural network to estimate\nthe macronutrient composition from the CGM signal, and compared it against a\nbaseline linear regression. The best prediction result comes from our proposed\nneural network, trained with subject-dependent data, as measured by root mean\nsquared relative error and correlation coefficient. These findings suggest that\nit is possible to estimate macronutrient composition from CGM signals, opening\nthe possibility to develop automatic techniques to track food intake.",
