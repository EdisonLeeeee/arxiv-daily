    "abstract": "Multidimensional population balance models (PBMs) describe chemical and\nbiological processes having a distribution over two or more intrinsic\nproperties (such as size and age, or two independent spatial variables). The\nincorporation of additional intrinsic variables into a PBM improves its\ndescriptive capability and can be necessary to capture specific features of\ninterest. As most PBMs of interest cannot be solved analytically,\ncomputationally expensive high-order finite difference or finite volume methods\nare frequently used to obtain an accurate numerical solution. We propose a\nfinite difference scheme based on operator splitting and solving each\nsub-problem at the limit of numerical stability that achieves a discretization\nerror that is zero for certain classes of PBMs and low enough to be acceptable\nfor other classes. In conjunction to employing specially constructed meshes and\nvariable transformations, the scheme exploits the commutative property of the\ndifferential operators present in many classes of PBMs. The scheme has very low\ncomputational cost -- potentially as low as just memory reallocation. Multiple\ncase studies demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme.",

    "abstract": "We study problems arising in real-time auction markets, common in e-commerce\nand computational advertising, where bidders face the problem of calculating\noptimal bids. We focus upon a contract management problem where a demand\naggregator is subject to multiple contractual obligations requiring them to\nacquire items of heterogeneous types at a specified rate, which they will seek\nto fulfill at minimum cost. Our main results show that, through a\ntransformation of variables, this problem can be formulated as a convex\noptimization problem, for both first and second price auctions. Convexity\nresults in efficient algorithms for solving instances of this problem, and the\nresulting duality theory admits rich structure and interpretations.\nAdditionally, we show that the transformation of variables used to formulate\nthis problem as a convex program can also be used to guarantee the convexity of\noptimal bidding problems studied by other authors (who did not leverage\nconvexity). Finally, we show how the expected cost of bidding in second price\nauctions is formally identical to certain transaction costs when submitting\nmarket orders in limit order book markets. This fact is used to analyze a\nMarkowitz portfolio problem which accounts for these transaction costs,\nestablishing an interesting connection between finance and optimal bidding.",

    "abstract": "Objective: We developed a hybrid volume surface integral equation (VSIE)\nmethod based on domain decomposition to perform fast and accurate magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) simulations that include both remote and local\nconductive elements. Methods: We separated the conductive surfaces present in\nMRI setups into two domains and optimized electromagnetic (EM) modeling for\neach case. Specifically, interactions between the body and EM waves originating\nfrom local radiofrequency (RF) coils were modeled with the precorrected fast\nFourier transform, whereas the interactions with remote conductive surfaces (RF\nshield, scanner bore) were modeled with a novel cross tensor train-based\nalgorithm. We compared the hybrid- VSIE with other VSIE methods for realistic\nMRI simulation setups. Results: The hybrid-VSIE was the only practical method\nfor simulation using 1 mm voxel isotropic resolution (VIR). For 2 mm VIR, our\nmethod could be solved at least 23 times faster and required 760 times lower\nmemory than traditional VSIE methods. Conclusion: The hybrid-VSIE demonstrated\na marked improvement in terms of convergence times of the numerical EM\nsimulation compared to traditional approaches in multiple realistic MRI\nscenarios.

In recent years, significant\nprogress has been made in solving challenging problems across various aspects\nof computational molecular optimizations, emphasizing high validity, diversity,\nand, most recently, synthesizability. Despite this progress, many papers report\nresults on trivial or self-designed tasks, bringing additional challenges to\ndirectly assessing the performance of new methods. Moreover, the sample\nefficiency of the optimization--the number of molecules evaluated by the\noracle--is rarely discussed, despite being an essential consideration for\nrealistic discovery applications.\nTo fill this gap, we have created an open-source benchmark for practical\nmolecular optimization, PMO, to facilitate the transparent and reproducible\nevaluation of algorithmic advances in molecular optimization. This paper\nthoroughly investigates the performance of 25 molecular design algorithms on 23\ntasks with a particular focus on sample efficiency. Our results show that most\n\"state-of-the-art\" methods fail to outperform their predecessors under a\nlimited oracle budget allowing 10K queries and that no existing algorithm can\nefficiently solve certain molecular optimization problems in this setting. We\nanalyze the influence of the optimization algorithm choices, molecular assembly\nstrategies, and oracle landscapes on the optimization performance to inform\nfuture algorithm development and benchmarking.

    "abstract": "Manufacturing companies typically use sophisticated production planning\nsystems optimizing production steps, often delivering near-optimal solutions.\nAs a downside for delivering a near-optimal schedule, planning systems have\nhigh computational demands resulting in hours of computation. Under normal\ncircumstances this is not issue if there is enough buffer time before\nimplementation of the schedule (e.g. at night for the next day). However, in\ncase of unexpected disruptions such as delayed part deliveries or defectively\nmanufactured goods, the planned schedule may become invalid and swift\nreplanning becomes necessary. Such immediate replanning is unsuited for\nexisting optimal planners due to the computational requirements. This paper\nproposes a novel solution that can effectively and efficiently perform\nreplanning in case of different types of disruptions using an existing plan.\nThe approach is based on the idea to adhere to the existing schedule as much as\npossible, adapting it based on limited local changes. For that purpose an\nagent-based scheduling mechanism has been devised, in which agents represent\nmaterials and production sites and use local optimization techniques and\nnegotiations to generate an adapted (sufficient, but non-optimal) schedule. The\napproach has been evaluated using real production data from Huawei, showing\nthat efficient schedules are produced in short time. The system has been\nimplemented as proof of concept and is currently reimplemented and transferred\nto a production system based on the Jadex agent platform.",

    "abstract": "A large fraction of data generated via human activities such as online\npurchases, health records, spatial mobility etc. can be represented as a\nsequence of events over a continuous-time. Learning deep learning models over\nthese continuous-time event sequences is a non-trivial task as it involves\nmodeling the ever-increasing event timestamps, inter-event time gaps, event\ntypes, and the influences between different events within and across different\nsequences. In recent years neural enhancements to marked temporal point\nprocesses (MTPP) have emerged as a powerful framework to model the underlying\ngenerative mechanism of asynchronous events localized in continuous time.\nHowever, most existing models and inference methods in the MTPP framework\nconsider only the complete observation scenario i.e. the event sequence being\nmodeled is completely observed with no missing events -- an ideal setting that\nis rarely applicable in real-world applications. A recent line of work which\nconsiders missing events while training MTPP utilizes supervised learning\ntechniques that require additional knowledge of missing or observed label for\neach event in a sequence, which further restricts its practicability as in\nseveral scenarios the details of missing events is not known apriori. In this\nwork, we provide a novel unsupervised model and inference method for learning\nMTPP in presence of event sequences with missing events. Specifically, we first\nmodel the generative processes of observed events and missing events using two\nMTPP, where the missing events are represented as latent random variables.\nThen, we devise an unsupervised training method that jointly learns both the\nMTPP by means of variational inference. Such a formulation can effectively\nimpute the missing data among the observed events and can identify the optimal\nposition of missing events in a sequence.",

Previous\nwork usually embeds KGs into a single geometric space such as Euclidean space\n(zero curved), hyperbolic space (negatively curved) or hyperspherical space\n(positively curved) to maintain their specific geometric structures (e.g.,\nchain, hierarchy and ring structures). However, the topological structure of\nKGs appears to be complicated, since it may contain multiple types of geometric\nstructures simultaneously. Therefore, embedding KGs in a single space, no\nmatter the Euclidean space, hyperbolic space or hyperspheric space, cannot\ncapture the complex structures of KGs accurately. To overcome this challenge,\nwe propose Geometry Interaction knowledge graph Embeddings (GIE), which learns\nspatial structures interactively between the Euclidean, hyperbolic and\nhyperspherical spaces.

Deep neural networks played a key role in spectral\nanalysis. However, the inference of deeper models is performed in a static\nmanner, and cannot be adjusted according to the device. Not all samples need to\nallocate all computation to reach confident prediction, which hinders\nmaximizing the overall performance. To address the above issues, we propose a\nSpectral data Classification framework with Adaptive Inference. Specifically,\nto allocate different computations for different samples while better\nexploiting the collaboration among different devices, we leverage Early-exit\narchitecture, place intermediate classifiers at different depths of the\narchitecture, and the model outputs the results when the prediction confidence\nreaches a preset threshold. We propose a training paradigm of self-distillation\nlearning, the deepest classifier performs soft supervision on the shallow ones\nto maximize their performance and training speed. At the same time, to mitigate\nthe vulnerability of performance to the location and number settings of\nintermediate classifiers in the Early-exit paradigm, we propose a\nPosition-Adaptive residual network. It can adjust the number of layers in each\nblock at different curve positions, so it can focus on important positions of\nthe curve (e.g.: Raman peak), and accurately allocate the appropriate\ncomputational budget based on task performance and computing resources.

Like any other Intelligent Electronic Device (IED), PMUs are prone to\nvarious types of cyberattacks. However, one form of attack is unique to the\nPMU, the GPS-spoofing attack, where the time and /or the one second pulse that\nenables time synchronization are modified and the measurements are computed\nusing the modified time reference. This article exploits the vulnerability of\nPMUs in their GPS time synchronization signal. At first, the paper proposes an\nundetectable attack scheme which is able to bypass Bad Data Detection (BDD)\nalgorithms used with PMU data. The attack is applied by solving a convex\noptimization criterion at regular time interval, so that after a specific time\nperiod the attack vector incurs a significant change in the angle information\ndelivered by the PMU. Secondly, the impact of phase angle shift on the power\nflow calculation between two adjacent nodes of the transmission line is\nanalyzed with numerical experiment using IEEE 39 bus system. Moreover, the\nundetectibilities of the proposed attack scheme against conventional $\\chi^2$,\nWeighted Least Squares (WLS) and Kalman Filtering test on the estimation\nresiduals are investigated. Finally, the power flow results with the proposed\nattack are compared with the results using a random GPS-spoofing attack. It can\nbe observed that using the proposed method enables the attacker with more\ncontrol over the impact against power grid than it is for the random attack.\nFurthermore, the proposed attack model has demonstrated a very small\nprobability of detection against each of the common detection methods.

    "abstract": "Hardware-based Malware Detectors (HMDs) have shown promise in detecting\nmalicious workloads. However, the current HMDs focus solely on the CPU core of\na System-on-Chip (SoC) and, therefore, do not exploit the full potential of the\nhardware telemetry. In this paper, we propose XMD, an HMD that operates on an\nexpansive set of telemetry channels extracted from the different subsystems of\nSoC. Key innovations in XMD are guided by analytical theorems that leverage the\nconcept of manifold hypothesis. XMD exploits the thread-level profiling power\nof the CPU-core telemetry, and the global profiling power of non-core telemetry\nchannels, to achieve significantly better detection performance and concept\ndrift robustness than currently used Hardware Performance Counter (HPC) based\ndetectors. We train and evaluate XMD using hardware telemetries collected from\n904 benign applications and 1205 malware samples. XMD improves over currently\nused HPC-based detectors by 32.91% for the in-distribution test data and by\n67.57% for the concept drift test data. XMD achieves the best detection\nperformance of 86.54% with a false positive rate of 2.9%, compared to the\ndetection rate of 80%, offered by the best performing software-based\nAnti-Virus(AV) on VirusTotal, on the same set of malware samples.",

Towards the goal of constructing\na conversational agent that can complete user tasks and support information\nseeking, it is important to build a system that handles both TOD and QA with\naccess to various external knowledge. In this work, we propose a new task,\nOpen-Book TOD (OB-TOD), which combines TOD with QA task and expand external\nknowledge sources to include both explicit knowledge sources (e.g., the Web)\nand implicit knowledge sources (e.g., pre-trained language models).

We propose a unified model\nOPERA (Open-book End-to-end Task-oriented Dialog) which can appropriately\naccess explicit and implicit external knowledge to tackle the defined task.\nExperimental results demonstrate OPERA's superior performance compared to\nclosed-book baselines and illustrate the value of both knowledge types.",

    "abstract": "The control of nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics has been a significant\nfield of research for many years. This paper presents a novel data-driven\noptimal adaptive control structure with less control effort and faster\nadaptation than standard adaptive control counterparts. The proposed control\nstructure utilizes the system's recorded data to increase the speed of\nadaptation and performance dramatically. In this study, we employ a conditional\ngenerative adversarial net (CGAN) as a novel central pattern generator to\nreproduce the steady-state harmonic pattern of the control signals matching the\nsystem's uncertainties over a wide range. We can also use the CGAN architecture\nas a fault detector. The CGAN provides a low-dimensional latent space of\nuncertainties. It enables rapid and convenient adaptation when there are many\nparametric uncertainties, especially for large-scale systems. Then, we\nintroduce a novel meta-reinforcement learning framework to adapt the latent\nspace of CGAN to the system's uncertainties as an optimal direct adaptive\ncontroller without any system identifier. Another part of the control structure\nis a regulator that achieves semi-global asymptotic tracking using the Lyapunov\nstability analysis.

While\nevent cameras can measure subtle brightness changes in high frame rates, the\nmeasurements in low lighting or extreme motion suffer from significant domain\ndiscrepancy with complex noise. As a result, the performance of event-based\nvision tasks does not transfer to challenging environments, where the event\ncameras are expected to thrive over normal cameras. We find that the multi-view\nconsistency of NeRF provides a powerful self-supervision signal for eliminating\nthe spurious measurements and extracting the consistent underlying structure\ndespite highly noisy input. Instead of posed images of the original NeRF, the\ninput to Ev-NeRF is the event measurements accompanied by the movements of the\nsensors. Using the loss function that reflects the measurement model of the\nsensor, Ev-NeRF creates an integrated neural volume that summarizes the\nunstructured and sparse data points captured for about 2-4 seconds. The\ngenerated neural volume can also produce intensity images from novel views with\nreasonable depth estimates, which can serve as a high-quality input to various\nvision-based tasks.

    "abstract": "Camera traps are a strategy for monitoring wildlife that collects a large\nnumber of pictures. The number of images collected from each species usually\nfollows a long-tail distribution, i.e., a few classes have a large number of\ninstances while a lot of species have just a small percentage. Although in most\ncases these rare species are the classes of interest to ecologists, they are\noften neglected when using deep learning models because these models require a\nlarge number of images for the training. In this work, we systematically\nevaluate recently proposed techniques - namely, square-root re-sampling,\nclass-balanced focal loss, and balanced group softmax - to address the\nlong-tail visual recognition of animal species in camera trap images. To\nachieve a more general conclusion, we evaluated the selected methods on four\nfamilies of computer vision models (ResNet, MobileNetV3, EfficientNetV2, and\nSwin Transformer) and four camera trap datasets with different characteristics.\nInitially, we prepared a robust baseline with the most recent training tricks\nand then we applied the methods for improving long-tail recognition. Our\nexperiments show that the Swin transformer can reach high performance for rare\nclasses without applying any additional method for handling imbalance, with an\noverall accuracy of 88.76% for WCS dataset and 94.97% for Snapshot Serengeti,\nconsidering a location-based train/test split. In general, the square-root\nsampling was the method that most improved the performance for minority classes\nby around 10%, but at the cost of reducing the majority classes accuracy at\nleast 4%. These results motivated us to propose a simple and effective approach\nusing an ensemble combining square-root sampling and the baseline.

Variational optical flow techniques based on a coarse-to-fine scheme\ninterpolate sparse matches and locally optimize an energy model conditioned on\ncolour, gradient and smoothness, making them sensitive to noise in the sparse\nmatches, deformations, and arbitrarily large displacements. This paper\naddresses this problem and presents HybridFlow, a variational motion estimation\nframework for large displacements and deformations. A multi-scale hybrid\nmatching approach is performed on the image pairs. Coarse-scale clusters formed\nby classifying pixels according to their feature descriptors are matched using\nthe clusters' context descriptors. We apply a multi-scale graph matching on the\nfiner-scale superpixels contained within each matched pair of coarse-scale\nclusters. Small clusters that cannot be further subdivided are matched using\nlocalized feature matching. Together, these initial matches form the flow,\nwhich is propagated by an edge-preserving interpolation and variational\nrefinement. Our approach does not require training and is robust to substantial\ndisplacements and rigid and non-rigid transformations due to motion in the\nscene, making it ideal for large-scale imagery such as Wide-Area Motion Imagery\n(WAMI). More notably, HybridFlow works on directed graphs of arbitrary topology\nrepresenting perceptual groups, which improves motion estimation in the\npresence of significant deformations.

It is therefore desirable that the\nevaluation metric for the perception system captures the safety-criticality of\nobjects. Unfortunately, existing perception evaluation metrics tend to make\nstrong assumptions about the objects and ignore the dynamic interactions\nbetween agents, and thus do not accurately capture the safety risks in reality.\nTo address these shortcomings, we introduce an interaction-dynamics-aware\nobstacle detection evaluation metric by accounting for closed-loop dynamic\ninteractions between an ego vehicle and obstacles in the scene. By borrowing\nexisting theory from optimal control theory, namely Hamilton-Jacobi\nreachability, we present a computationally tractable method for constructing a\n``safety zone'': a region in state space that defines where safety-critical\nobstacles lie for the purpose of defining safety metrics. Our proposed safety\nzone is mathematically complete, and can be easily computed to reflect a\nvariety of safety requirements.

The introduced solution consists of\ntwo parts: a filter and a controller. Firstly, an adaptive NN-based stochastic\nfilter is proposed that estimates attitude components and dynamics using\nmeasurements supplied by onboard sensors directly. The filter design accounts\nfor measurement uncertainties inherent to the attitude dynamics, namely unknown\nbias and noise corrupting angular velocity measurements. The closed loop\nsignals of the proposed NN-based stochastic filter have been shown to be\nsemi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Secondly, a novel control\nlaw on $SO(3)$ coupled with the proposed estimator is presented. The control\nlaw addresses unknown disturbances. In addition, the closed loop signals of the\nproposed filter-based controller have been shown to be SGUUB. The proposed\napproach offers robust tracking performance by supplying the required control\nsignal given data extracted from low-cost inertial measurement units. While the\nfilter-based controller is presented in continuous form, the discrete\nimplementation is also presented. Additionally, the unit-quaternion form of the\nproposed approach is given. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed\nfilter-based controller is demonstrated using its discrete form and considering\nlow sampling rate, high initialization error, high-level of measurement\nuncertainties, and unknown disturbances.

    "abstract": "Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a preclinical stage of Alzheimer's\ndisease (AD) which occurs even before mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\nProgressive SCD will convert to MCI with the potential of further evolving to\nAD. Therefore, early identification of progressive SCD with neuroimaging\ntechniques (e.g., structural MRI) is of great clinical value for early\nintervention of AD. However, existing MRI-based machine/deep learning methods\nusually suffer the small-sample-size problem which poses a great challenge to\nrelated neuroimaging analysis. The central question we aim to tackle in this\npaper is how to leverage related domains (e.g., AD/NC) to assist the\nprogression prediction of SCD. Meanwhile, we are concerned about which brain\nareas are more closely linked to the identification of progressive SCD. To this\nend, we propose an attention-guided autoencoder model for efficient\ncross-domain adaptation which facilitates the knowledge transfer from AD to\nSCD. The proposed model is composed of four key components: 1) a feature\nencoding module for learning shared subspace representations of different\ndomains, 2) an attention module for automatically locating discriminative brain\nregions of interest defined in brain atlases, 3) a decoding module for\nreconstructing the original input, 4) a classification module for\nidentification of brain diseases. Through joint training of these four modules,\ndomain invariant features can be learned. Meanwhile, the brain disease related\nregions can be highlighted by the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on\nthe publicly available ADNI dataset and a private CLAS dataset have\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed model is\nstraightforward to train and test with only 5-10 seconds on CPUs and is\nsuitable for medical tasks with small datasets.",

In this\npaper we focus on one particular aspect of reliability, namely that an\nexplainer should give similar explanations for similar data inputs. We\nformalize this notion by introducing and defining explainer astuteness,\nanalogous to astuteness of classifiers. Our formalism is inspired by the\nconcept of probabilistic Lipschitzness, which captures the probability of local\nsmoothness of a function. For a variety of explainers (e.g., SHAP, RISE,\nCXPlain), we provide lower bound guarantees on the astuteness of these\nexplainers given the Lipschitzness of the prediction function.

Convolutional neural networks are highly\ncapable tools for extracting spatial information and very suitable for event\nrecognition applications in DAS.

    "abstract": "The performance properties of byte-addressable persistent memory (PMEM) have\nthe potential to significantly improve system performance over a wide spectrum\nof applications. But persistent memory brings considerable new challenges to\nthe programmer: only 8-byte write atomicity, out of order flush and\navailability limited by node failure. It's possible to work with the atomicity\nand ordering constraints of PMEM directly by carefully sequencing the order of\nstore operations and inserting explicit flush and fence operations at each\nordering point. But this is tedious and error-prone: too many flush operations\ndefeat the performance benefits of PMEM, and even with generous use, it is\ndifficult to prove that a given program is crash-consistent. Logging is a great\nabstraction to deal with these issues but prior work on PMEM logging has not\nsuccessfully hidden the idiosyncrasies of PMEM. Moreover, shortcomings in the\nlog interface and design have prevented attainment of full PMEM performance. We\nbelieve that a log design that hides the idiosyncrasies from programmers while\ndelivering full performance is key to success. In this paper, we present the\ndesign and implementation of Arcadia, a generic replicated log on PMEM to\naddress these problems. Arcadia handles atomicity, integrity, and replication\nof log records to reduce programmer burden. Our design has several novel\naspects including concurrent log writes with in-order commit, atomicity and\nintegrity primitives for local and remote PMEM writes, and a frequency-based\nlog force policy for providing low overhead persistence with guaranteed bounded\nloss of uncommitted records. Our evaluation shows that Arcadia outperforms\nstate-of-the-art PMEM logs, such as PMDK's libpmemlog, FLEX, and Query Fresh by\nseveral times while providing stronger log record durability guarantees.

We consider an active shape\nmodel, where -- for an object category -- we are given a library of potential\nCAD models describing objects in that category, and we adopt a standard\nformulation where pose and shape are estimated from 2D or 3D keypoints via\nnon-convex optimization. Our first contribution is to develop PACE3D* and\nPACE2D*, the first certifiably optimal solvers for pose and shape estimation\nusing 3D and 2D keypoints, respectively. Both solvers rely on the design of\ntight (i.e., exact) semidefinite relaxations. Our second contribution is to\ndevelop outlier-robust versions of both solvers, named PACE3D# and PACE2D#.\nTowards this goal, we propose ROBIN, a general graph-theoretic framework to\nprune outliers, which uses compatibility hypergraphs to model measurements'\ncompatibility. We show that in category-level perception problems these\nhypergraphs can be built from winding orders of the keypoints (in 2D) or their\nconvex hulls (in 3D), and many outliers can be pruned via maximum hyperclique\ncomputation. The last contribution is an extensive experimental evaluation.\nBesides providing an ablation study on simulated datasets and on the PASCAL\ndataset, we combine our solver with a deep keypoint detector, and show that\nPACE3D# improves over the state of the art in vehicle pose estimation in the\nApolloScape datasets, and its runtime is compatible with practical\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Active inference is a state-of-the-art framework for modelling the brain that\nexplains a wide range of mechanisms such as habit formation, dopaminergic\ndischarge and curiosity. Recently, two versions of branching time active\ninference (BTAI) based on Monte-Carlo tree search have been developed to handle\nthe exponential (space and time) complexity class that occurs when computing\nthe prior over all possible policies up to the time horizon. However, those two\nversions of BTAI still suffer from an exponential complexity class w.r.t the\nnumber of observed and latent variables being modelled. In the present paper,\nwe resolve this limitation by first allowing the modelling of several\nobservations, each of them having its own likelihood mapping. Similarly, we\nallow each latent state to have its own transition mapping. The inference\nalgorithm then exploits the factorisation of the likelihood and transition\nmappings to accelerate the computation of the posterior. Those two\noptimisations were tested on the dSprites environment in which the metadata of\nthe dSprites dataset was used as input to the model instead of the dSprites\nimages. On this task, $BTAI_{VMP}$ (Champion et al., 2022b,a) was able to solve\n96.9\\% of the task in 5.1 seconds, and $BTAI_{BF}$ (Champion et al., 2021a) was\nable to solve 98.6\\% of the task in 17.5 seconds. Our new approach\n($BTAI_{3MF}$) outperformed both of its predecessors by solving the task\ncompletly (100\\%) in only 2.559 seconds. Finally, $BTAI_{3MF}$ has been\nimplemented in a flexible and easy to use (python) package, and we developed a\ngraphical user interface to enable the inspection of the model's beliefs,\nplanning process and behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Hyperpolarized (HP) $^{13}$C-Pyruvate MR imaging provides unique information\nabout metabolic alterations indicative of the aggressiveness of certain cancer\ntypes. The information content of the HP-MRI data is fundamentally limited by\nthe physics and chemistry of specific processes that take place at an atomic\nscale during a well-defined chemical reaction. The HP signal (magnetization of\npyruvate and lactate) is a fixed resource that is established at the polarizer\nand naturally decays over time, and cannot be renewed after injection. The\nsignal is further reduced with every radio-frequency excitation by the MR pulse\nsequence. Therefore, optimal experimental design (OED) for data acquisition is\nfundamentally important. A key parameter of interest recovered from HP-MRI\nmeasurements is the apparent pyruvate-to-lactate exchange rate, $k_{PL}$, for\nmeasuring tumor metabolism. This manuscript presents an\ninformation-theory-based OED approach that minimizes the uncertainty in the\nrate parameter, $k_{PL}$, recovered from the HP-MRI measurements.\nResults suggest that the mutual information-based optimal data acquisition\nstrategy is likely to improve the precision of the measurements. For the\nparticular MRI data examined here, pyruvate and lactate flip angles of 35 and\n28 degrees, respectively, were the best choice in terms of accuracy and\nprecision of the parameter recovery. Moreover, the recovery of rate parameter\n$k_{PL}$ from the data generated from the high-fidelity model highlights the\ninfluence of diffusion and strength of vascular source on the recovered rate\nparameter. Since the existing pharmacokinetic models for HP-MRI do not account\nfor spatial variation, the optimized design parameters may not be fully optimal\nin a more general 3D setting.",

By conducting experiments over various\nNMT datasets, we find that hallucination is often accompanied by the deficient\nencoder, especially embeddings, and vulnerable cross-attentions, while,\ninterestingly, cross-attention mitigates some errors caused by the encoder.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised methods have significantly closed the gap with end-to-end\nsupervised learning for image classification. In the case of human action\nvideos, however, where both appearance and motion are significant factors of\nvariation, this gap remains significant. One of the key reasons for this is\nthat sampling pairs of similar video clips, a required step for many\nself-supervised contrastive learning methods, is currently done conservatively\nto avoid false positives. A typical assumption is that similar clips only occur\ntemporally close within a single video, leading to insufficient examples of\nmotion similarity. To mitigate this, we propose SLIC, a clustering-based\nself-supervised contrastive learning method for human action videos. Our key\ncontribution is that we improve upon the traditional intra-video positive\nsampling by using iterative clustering to group similar video instances. This\nenables our method to leverage pseudo-labels from the cluster assignments to\nsample harder positives and negatives. SLIC outperforms state-of-the-art video\nretrieval baselines by +15.4% on top-1 recall on UCF101 and by +5.7% when\ndirectly transferred to HMDB51. With end-to-end finetuning for action\nclassification, SLIC achieves 83.2% top-1 accuracy (+0.8%) on UCF101 and 54.5%\non HMDB51 (+1.6%).

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms suffer severe performance\ndegradation when the interaction data is scarce, which limits their real-world\napplication. Recently, visual representation learning has been shown to be\neffective and promising for boosting sample efficiency in RL. These methods\nusually rely on contrastive learning and data augmentation to train a\ntransition model for state prediction, which is different from how the model is\nused in RL--performing value-based planning. Accordingly, the learned model may\nnot be able to align well with the environment and generate consistent value\npredictions, especially when the state transition is not deterministic. To\naddress this issue, we propose a novel method, called value-consistent\nrepresentation learning (VCR), to learn representations that are directly\nrelated to decision-making. More specifically, VCR trains a model to predict\nthe future state (also referred to as the ''imagined state'') based on the\ncurrent one and a sequence of actions. Instead of aligning this imagined state\nwith a real state returned by the environment, VCR applies a $Q$-value head on\nboth states and obtains two distributions of action values. Then a distance is\ncomputed and minimized to force the imagined state to produce a similar action\nvalue prediction as that by the real state. We develop two implementations of\nthe above idea for the discrete and continuous action spaces respectively. We\nconduct experiments on Atari 100K and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks to\nvalidate their effectiveness for improving sample efficiency.

The\nrandomized Kaczmarz method (RK) and similar stochastic iterative methods have\nreceived considerable recent attention due to their efficient implementation\nand memory footprint. These methods can tolerate streaming data, accessing only\npart of the data at a time, and can also approximate the least squares solution\neven if the system is affected by noise. However, when data is instead affected\nby large (possibly adversarial) corruptions, these methods fail to converge, as\ncorrupted data points draw iterates far from the true solution. A recently\nproposed solution to this is the QuantileRK method, which avoids harmful\ncorrupted data by exploring the space carefully as the method iterates. The\nexploration component requires the computation of quantiles of large samples\nfrom the system and is computationally much heavier than the subsequent\niteration update.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach that better uses the information\nobtained during exploration by incorporating an averaged version of the block\nKaczmarz method. This significantly speeds up convergence, while still allowing\nfor a constant fraction of the equations to be arbitrarily corrupted. We\nprovide theoretical convergence guarantees as well as experimental supporting\nevidence. We also demonstrate that the classical projection-based block\nKaczmarz method cannot be robust to sparse adversarial corruptions, but rather\nthe blocking has to be carried out by averaging one-dimensional projections.",

However, these models\ncontain enormous amounts of parameters, which restrict their deployment to\nreal-world applications. To reduce the model size, researchers prune these\nmodels based on the weights' importance scores. However, such scores are\nusually estimated on mini-batches during training, which incurs large\nvariability/uncertainty due to mini-batch sampling and complicated training\ndynamics. As a result, some crucial weights could be pruned by commonly used\npruning methods because of such uncertainty, which makes training unstable and\nhurts generalization.

    "abstract": "We describe our approach for the generative emotional vocal burst task (ExVo\nGenerate) of the ICML Expressive Vocalizations Competition. We train a\nconditional StyleGAN2 architecture on mel-spectrograms of preprocessed versions\nof the audio samples. The mel-spectrograms generated by the model are then\ninverted back to the audio domain. As a result, our generated samples\nsubstantially improve upon the baseline provided by the competition from a\nqualitative and quantitative perspective for all emotions. More precisely, even\nfor our worst-performing emotion (awe), we obtain an FAD of 1.76 compared to\nthe baseline of 4.81 (as a reference, the FAD between the train/validation sets\nfor awe is 0.776).",

    "abstract": "Face recognition has achieved considerable progress in recent years thanks to\nthe development of deep neural networks, but it has recently been discovered\nthat deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples. This means\nthat face recognition models or systems based on deep neural networks are also\nsusceptible to adversarial examples. However, the existing methods of attacking\nface recognition models or systems with adversarial examples can effectively\ncomplete white-box attacks but not black-box impersonation attacks, physical\nattacks, or convenient attacks, particularly on commercial face recognition\nsystems. In this paper, we propose a new method to attack face recognition\nmodels or systems called RSTAM, which enables an effective black-box\nimpersonation attack using an adversarial mask printed by a mobile and compact\nprinter. First, RSTAM enhances the transferability of the adversarial masks\nthrough our proposed random similarity transformation strategy. Furthermore, we\npropose a random meta-optimization strategy for ensembling several pre-trained\nface models to generate more general adversarial masks. Finally, we conduct\nexperiments on the CelebA-HQ, LFW, Makeup Transfer (MT), and CASIA-FaceV5\ndatasets. The performance of the attacks is also evaluated on state-of-the-art\ncommercial face recognition systems: Face++, Baidu, Aliyun, Tencent, and\nMicrosoft. Extensive experiments show that RSTAM can effectively perform\nblack-box impersonation attacks on face recognition models or systems.",

    "title": "Asymmetric Transfer Hashing with Adaptive Bipartite Graph Learning",
    "abstract": "Thanks to the efficient retrieval speed and low storage consumption, learning\nto hash has been widely used in visual retrieval tasks. However, existing\nhashing methods assume that the query and retrieval samples lie in homogeneous\nfeature space within the same domain. As a result, they cannot be directly\napplied to heterogeneous cross-domain retrieval. In this paper, we propose a\nGeneralized Image Transfer Retrieval (GITR) problem, which encounters two\ncrucial bottlenecks: 1) the query and retrieval samples may come from different\ndomains, leading to an inevitable {domain distribution gap}; 2) the features of\nthe two domains may be heterogeneous or misaligned, bringing up an additional\n{feature gap}. To address the GITR problem, we propose an Asymmetric Transfer\nHashing (ATH) framework with its unsupervised/semi-supervised/supervised\nrealizations. Specifically, ATH characterizes the domain distribution gap by\nthe discrepancy between two asymmetric hash functions, and minimizes the\nfeature gap with the help of a novel adaptive bipartite graph constructed on\ncross-domain data. By jointly optimizing asymmetric hash functions and the\nbipartite graph, not only can knowledge transfer be achieved but information\nloss caused by feature alignment can also be avoided. Meanwhile, to alleviate\nnegative transfer, the intrinsic geometrical structure of single-domain data is\npreserved by involving a domain affinity graph. Extensive experiments on both\nsingle-domain and cross-domain benchmarks under different GITR subtasks\nindicate the superiority of our ATH method in comparison with the\nstate-of-the-art hashing methods.",

    "abstract": "Deformable image registration is a crucial step in medical image analysis for\nfinding a non-linear spatial transformation between a pair of fixed and moving\nimages. Deep registration methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\nhave been widely used as they can perform image registration in a fast and\nend-to-end manner. However, these methods usually have limited performance for\nimage pairs with large deformations. Recently, iterative deep registration\nmethods have been used to alleviate this limitation, where the transformations\nare iteratively learned in a coarse-to-fine manner. However, iterative methods\ninevitably prolong the registration runtime, and tend to learn separate image\nfeatures for each iteration, which hinders the features from being leveraged to\nfacilitate the registration at later iterations. In this study, we propose a\nNon-Iterative Coarse-to-finE registration Network (NICE-Net) for deformable\nimage registration. In the NICE-Net, we propose: (i) a Single-pass Deep\nCumulative Learning (SDCL) decoder that can cumulatively learn coarse-to-fine\ntransformations within a single pass (iteration) of the network, and (ii) a\nSelectively-propagated Feature Learning (SFL) encoder that can learn common\nimage features for the whole coarse-to-fine registration process and\nselectively propagate the features as needed. Extensive experiments on six\npublic datasets of 3D brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) show that our\nproposed NICE-Net can outperform state-of-the-art iterative deep registration\nmethods while only requiring similar runtime to non-iterative methods.",

In this approach, data-label querying\nis guided according to the expected value of perfect information for incipient\ndata points. For SHM applications, the value of information is evaluated with\nrespect to a maintenance decision process, and the data-label querying\ncorresponds to the inspection of a structure to determine its health state.\nSampling bias is a known issue within active-learning paradigms; this occurs\nwhen an active learning process over- or undersamples specific regions of a\nfeature-space, thereby resulting in a training set that is not representative\nof the underlying distribution. This bias ultimately degrades decision-making\nperformance, and as a consequence, results in unnecessary costs incurred. The\ncurrent paper outlines a risk-based approach to active learning that utilises a\nsemi-supervised Gaussian mixture model.

In this context, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), by\nembedding the knowledge of the differential model that governs the physical\nphenomenon in the learning process, can effectively address the inverse and\nforward problem of data-driven learning and solving the corresponding epidemic\nproblem. In many circumstances, however, the spatial propagation of an\ninfectious disease is characterized by movements of individuals at different\nscales governed by multiscale PDEs. This reflects the heterogeneity of a region\nor territory in relation to the dynamics within cities and in neighboring\nzones. In presence of multiple scales, a direct application of PINNs generally\nleads to poor results due to the multiscale nature of the differential model in\nthe loss function of the neural network. To allow the neural network to operate\nuniformly with respect to the small scales, it is desirable that the neural\nnetwork satisfies an Asymptotic-Preservation (AP) property in the learning\nprocess. To this end, we consider a new class of AP Neural Networks (APNNs) for\nmultiscale hyperbolic transport models of epidemic spread that, thanks to an\nappropriate AP formulation of the loss function, is capable to work uniformly\nat the different scales of the system. A series of numerical tests for\ndifferent epidemic scenarios confirms the validity of the proposed approach,\nhighlighting the importance of the AP property in the neural network when\ndealing with multiscale problems especially in presence of sparse and partially\nobserved systems.",

Variables are absent\nduring inference because of long-term data loss (eg. sensor failures) or high\n-> low-resource domain shift between train / test. To the best of our\nknowledge, robustness of MTSF models in presence of such failures, has not been\nstudied in the literature. Through extensive evaluation, we first show that the\nperformance of state of the art methods degrade significantly in the VSF\nsetting.

To address these issues, we construct a new\npoint cloud upsampling pipeline called BIMS-PU that integrates the feature\npyramid architecture with a bi-directional up and downsampling path.\nSpecifically, we decompose the up/downsampling procedure into several\nup/downsampling sub-steps by breaking the target sampling factor into smaller\nfactors. The multi-scale features are naturally produced in a parallel manner\nand aggregated using a fast feature fusion method. Supervision signal is\nsimultaneously applied to all upsampled point clouds of different scales.\nMoreover, we formulate a residual block to ease the training of our model.\nExtensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on different datasets show\nthat our method achieves superior results to state-of-the-art approaches.

    "abstract": "In this work we propose an algorithm for trace recovery from stochastically\nknown logs, a setting that is becoming more common with the increasing number\nof sensors and predictive models that generate uncertain data. The suggested\napproach calculates the conformance between a process model and a\nstochastically known trace and recovers the best alignment within this\nstochastic trace as the true trace. The paper offers an analysis of the impact\nof various cost models on trace recovery accuracy and makes use of a product\nmulti-graph to compare alternative trace recovery options. The average accuracy\nof our approach, evaluated using two publicly available datasets, is\nimpressive, with an average recovery accuracy score of 90-97%, significantly\nimproving a common heuristic that chooses the most likely value for each\nuncertain activity. We believe that the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm\nin recovering correct traces from stochastically known logs may be a powerful\naid for developing credible decision-making tools in uncertain settings.",

The resolution of input images can be\nreduced, however, with significant loss of critical information. Based on the\noutlined issues, we introduce a novel research problem of training CNN models\nfor very large images, and present 'UltraMNIST dataset', a simple yet\nrepresentative benchmark dataset for this task.

The accumulation of large amounts of data in many\ndomains, such as healthcare and e-commerce, has led to increased interest in\ndeveloping data-driven algorithms for estimating heterogeneous effects from\nobservational and experimental data. However, these methods often make strong\nassumptions about the observed features and ignore the underlying causal model\nstructure, which can lead to biased HTE estimation. At the same time,\naccounting for the causal structure of real-world data is rarely trivial since\nthe causal mechanisms that gave rise to the data are typically unknown. To\naddress this problem, we develop a feature selection method that considers each\nfeature's value for HTE estimation and learns the relevant parts of the causal\nstructure from data. We provide strong empirical evidence that our method\nimproves existing data-driven HTE estimation methods under arbitrary underlying\ncausal structures.

Our framework consists of a cascade of two\nnetworks, one responsible for identifying anatomical abnormalities and the\nsecond responsible for pathological observations. The critical component in our\nframework is an anatomy-guided attention module that aids the downstream\nobservation network in focusing on the relevant anatomical regions generated by\nthe anatomy network. We use Positive Unlabeled (PU) learning to account for the\nfact that lack of mention does not necessarily mean a negative label. Our\nquantitative and qualitative results on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate the\neffectiveness of AGXNet in disease and anatomical abnormality localization.\nExperiments on the NIH Chest X-ray dataset show that the learned feature\nrepresentations are transferable and can achieve the state-of-the-art\nperformances in disease classification and competitive disease localization\nresults.

    "abstract": "Data collected by IoT devices are often private and have a large diversity\nacross users. Therefore, learning requires pre-training a model with available\nrepresentative data samples, deploying the pre-trained model on IoT devices,\nand adapting the deployed model on the device with local data. Such an\non-device adaption for deep learning empowered applications demands data and\nmemory efficiency. However, existing gradient-based meta learning schemes fail\nto support memory-efficient adaptation. To this end, we propose p-Meta, a new\nmeta learning method that enforces structure-wise partial parameter updates\nwhile ensuring fast generalization to unseen tasks. Evaluations on few-shot\nimage classification and reinforcement learning tasks show that p-Meta not only\nimproves the accuracy but also substantially reduces the peak dynamic memory by\na factor of 2.5 on average compared to state-of-the-art few-shot adaptation\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "The rising growth of deep neural networks (DNNs) and datasets in size\nmotivates the need for efficient solutions for simultaneous model selection and\ntraining. Many methods for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) of iterative\nlearners including DNNs attempt to solve this problem by querying and learning\na response surface while searching for the optimum of that surface. However,\nmany of these methods make myopic queries, do not consider prior knowledge\nabout the response structure, and/or perform biased cost-aware search, all of\nwhich exacerbate identifying the best-performing model when a total cost budget\nis specified. This paper proposes a novel approach referred to as Budget-Aware\nPlanning for Iterative Learners (BAPI) to solve HPO problems under a\nconstrained cost budget. BAPI is an efficient non-myopic Bayesian optimization\nsolution that accounts for the budget and leverages the prior knowledge about\nthe objective function and cost function to select better configurations and to\ntake more informed decisions during the evaluation (training). Experiments on\ndiverse HPO benchmarks for iterative learners show that BAPI performs better\nthan state-of-the-art baselines in most of the cases.",

    "abstract": "Beyond achieving high performance across many vision tasks, multimodal models\nare expected to be robust to single-source faults due to the availability of\nredundant information between modalities. In this paper, we investigate the\nrobustness of multimodal neural networks against worst-case (i.e., adversarial)\nperturbations on a single modality. We first show that standard multimodal\nfusion models are vulnerable to single-source adversaries: an attack on any\nsingle modality can overcome the correct information from multiple unperturbed\nmodalities and cause the model to fail. This surprising vulnerability holds\nacross diverse multimodal tasks and necessitates a solution. Motivated by this\nfinding, we propose an adversarially robust fusion strategy that trains the\nmodel to compare information coming from all the input sources, detect\ninconsistencies in the perturbed modality compared to the other modalities, and\nonly allow information from the unperturbed modalities to pass through. Our\napproach significantly improves on state-of-the-art methods in single-source\nrobustness, achieving gains of 7.8-25.2% on action recognition, 19.7-48.2% on\nobject detection, and 1.6-6.7% on sentiment analysis, without degrading\nperformance on unperturbed (i.e., clean) data.",

    "abstract": "Many real-world applications can be formulated as multi-agent cooperation\nproblems, such as network packet routing and coordination of autonomous\nvehicles. The emergence of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides a\npromising approach for multi-agent cooperation through the interaction of the\nagents and environments. However, traditional DRL solutions suffer from the\nhigh dimensions of multiple agents with continuous action space during policy\nsearch. Besides, the dynamicity of agents' policies makes the training\nnon-stationary. To tackle the issues, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement\nlearning approach with high-level decision-making and low-level individual\ncontrol for efficient policy search. In particular, the cooperation of multiple\nagents can be learned in high-level discrete action space efficiently. At the\nsame time, the low-level individual control can be reduced to single-agent\nreinforcement learning. In addition to hierarchical reinforcement learning, we\npropose an opponent modeling network to model other agents' policies during the\nlearning process. In contrast to end-to-end DRL approaches, our approach\nreduces the learning complexity by decomposing the overall task into sub-tasks\nin a hierarchical way. To evaluate the efficiency of our approach, we conduct a\nreal-world case study in the cooperative lane change scenario. Both simulation\nand real-world experiments show the superiority of our approach in the\ncollision rate and convergence speed.",

To tackle the\nchallenge of planning and controlling contact-rich behaviors in such settings,\nthis work uses Hybrid Force-Velocity Controllers (HFVCs) as the skill\nrepresentation and plans skill sequences with learned preconditions. While\nHFVCs naturally enable robust and compliant contact-rich behaviors, solvers\nthat synthesize them have traditionally relied on precise object models and\nclosed-loop feedback on object pose, which are difficult to obtain in\nconstrained environments due to occlusions. We first relax HFVCs' need for\nprecise models and feedback with our HFVC synthesis framework, then learn a\npoint-cloud-based precondition function to classify where HFVC executions will\nstill be successful despite modeling inaccuracies. Finally, we use the learned\nprecondition in a search-based task planner to complete contact-rich\nmanipulation tasks in a shelf domain. Our method achieves a task success rate\nof $73.2\\%$, outperforming the $51.5\\%$ achieved by a baseline without the\nlearned precondition.

Contrary to their (a)synchronous\ninterpretations, the Most Permissive (MP) interpretation guarantees capturing\nall the trajectories of any quantitative system compatible with the BN, without\nadditional parameters. Notably, the MP mode has the ability to capture\ntransitions related to the heterogeneity of time scales and concentration\nscales in the abstracted quantitative system and which are not captured by\nasynchronous modes. So far, the analysis of MPBNs has focused on Boolean\ndynamical properties, such as the existence of particular trajectories or\nattractors. This paper addresses the sampling of trajectories from MPBNs in\norder to quantify the propensities of attractors reachable from a given initial\nBN configuration. The computation of MP transitions from a configuration is\nperformed by iteratively discovering possible state changes. The number of\niterations is referred to as the permissive depth, where the first depth\ncorresponds to the asynchronous transitions. This permissive depth reflects the\npotential concentration and time scales heterogeneity along the abstracted\nquantitative process. The simulation of MPBNs is illustrated on several models\nfrom the literature, on which the depth parametrization can help to assess the\nrobustness of predictions on attractor propensities changes triggered by model\nperturbations.",

Fall detection can be performed using wearable devices or ambient\nsensors; these methods may struggle with user compliance issues or false\nalarms. Video cameras provide a passive alternative; however, regular RGB\ncameras are impacted by changing lighting conditions and privacy concerns. From\na machine learning perspective, developing an effective fall detection system\nis challenging because of the rarity and variability of falls. Many existing\nfall detection datasets lack important real-world considerations, such as\nvaried lighting, continuous activities of daily living (ADLs), and camera\nplacement.

    "title": "Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with  Outstanding Ballots",
    "abstract": "Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice\nvoting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to\nrank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one\ncandidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to\nincrease elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback\nof RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be\ntallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly\nlarge portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes\nare not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be\npublished, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.\nIn this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible\nwinners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data\nfrom the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques\nallow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and\nin some case identify the winner as soon as election night despite a number of\nyet-unaccounted absentee ballots, providing more transparency in the electoral\nprocess.",

    "abstract": "Given trajectories with gaps, we investigate methods to tighten spatial\nbounds on areas (e.g., nodes in a spatial network) where possible rendezvous\nactivity could have occurred. The problem is important for reducing the onerous\namount of manual effort to post-process possible rendezvous areas using\nsatellite imagery and has many societal applications to improve public safety,\nsecurity, and health. The problem of rendezvous detection is challenging due to\nthe difficulty of interpreting missing data within a trajectory gap and the\nvery high cost of detecting gaps in such a large volume of location data. Most\nrecent literature presents formal models, namely space-time prism, to track an\nobject's rendezvous patterns within trajectory gaps on a spatial network.\nHowever, the bounds derived from the space-time prism are rather loose,\nresulting in unnecessarily extensive post-processing manual effort. To address\nthese limitations, we propose a Time Slicing-based Gap-Aware Rendezvous\nDetection (TGARD) algorithm to tighten the spatial bounds in spatial networks.\nWe propose a Dual Convergence TGARD (DC-TGARD) algorithm to improve\ncomputational efficiency using a bi-directional pruning approach. Theoretical\nresults show the proposed spatial bounds on the area of possible rendezvous are\ntighter than that from related work (space-time prism). Experimental results on\nsynthetic and real-world spatial networks (e.g., road networks) show that the\nproposed DC-TGARD is more scalable than the TGARD algorithm.",

In\nthis paper, we explored three main accent modelling methods combined with two\ndifferent classifiers based on 105 speaker recordings retrieved from five urban\nvarieties in Northern England.

    "title": "Efficiently Leveraging Multi-level User Intent for Session-based  Recommendation via Atten-Mixer Network",
    "abstract": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the user next action based\non short and dynamic sessions. Recently, there has been an increasing interest\nin utilizing various elaborately designed graph neural networks (GNNs) to\ncapture the pair-wise relationships among items, seemingly suggesting the\ndesign of more complicated models is the panacea for improving the empirical\nperformance. However, these models achieve relatively marginal improvements\nwith exponential growth in model complexity. In this paper, we dissect the\nclassical GNN-based SBR models and empirically find that some sophisticated GNN\npropagations are redundant, given the readout module plays a significant role\nin GNN-based models. Based on this observation, we intuitively propose to\nremove the GNN propagation part, while the readout module will take on more\nresponsibility in the model reasoning process. To this end, we propose the\nMulti-Level Attention Mixture Network (Atten-Mixer), which leverages both\nconcept-view and instance-view readouts to achieve multi-level reasoning over\nitem transitions. As simply enumerating all possible high-level concepts is\ninfeasible for large real-world recommender systems, we further incorporate\nSBR-related inductive biases, i.e., local invariance and inherent priority to\nprune the search space. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of our proposal.",

    "abstract": "Real-world applications require a robot operating in the physical world with\nawareness of potential risks besides accomplishing the task. A large part of\nrisky behaviors arises from interacting with objects in ignorance of\naffordance. To prevent the agent from making unsafe decisions, we propose to\ntrain a robotic agent by reinforcement learning to execute tasks with an\nawareness of physical properties such as mass and friction in an indoor\nenvironment. We achieve this through a novel physics-inspired reward function\nthat encourages the agent to learn a policy discerning different masses and\nfriction coefficients. We introduce two novel and challenging indoor\nrearrangement tasks -- the variable friction pushing task and the variable mass\npushing task -- that allow evaluation of the learned policies in trading off\nperformance and physics-inspired risk. Our results demonstrate that by\nequipping with the proposed reward, the agent is able to learn policies\nchoosing the pushing targets or goal-reaching trajectories with minimum\nphysical cost, which can be further utilized as a precaution to constrain the\nagent's behavior in a safety-critic environment.",

    "abstract": "With the improvement of AI chips (e.g., GPU, TPU, and NPU) and the fast\ndevelopment of internet of things (IoTs), some powerful deep neural networks\n(DNNs) are usually composed of millions or even hundreds of millions of\nparameters, which may not be suitable to be directly deployed on low\ncomputation and low capacity units (e.g., edge devices). Recently, knowledge\ndistillation (KD) has been recognized as one of the effective method of model\ncompression to decrease the model parameters. The main concept of KD is to\nextract useful information from the feature maps of a large model (i.e.,\nteacher model) as a reference to successfully train a small model (i.e.,\nstudent model) which model size is much smaller than the teacher one. Although\nmany KD-based methods have been proposed to utilize the information from the\nfeature maps of intermediate layers in teacher model, however, most of them did\nnot consider the similarity of feature maps between teacher model and student\nmodel, which may let student model learn useless information. Inspired by\nattention mechanism, we propose a novel KD method called representative teacher\nkey (RTK) that not only consider the similarity of feature maps but also filter\nout the useless information to improve the performance of the target student\nmodel. In the experiments, we validate our proposed method with several\nbackbone networks (e.g., ResNet and WideResNet) and datasets (e.g., CIFAR10,\nCIFAR100, SVHN, and CINIC10). The results show that our proposed RTK can\neffectively improve the classification accuracy of the state-of-the-art\nattention-based KD method.",

    "abstract": "Recent research in Internet of things has been widely applied for industrial\npractices, fostering the exponential growth of data and connected devices.\nHenceforth, data-driven AI models would be accessed by different parties\nthrough certain data-sharing policies. However, most of the current training\nprocedures rely on the centralized data-collection strategy and a single\ncomputational server. However, such a centralized scheme may lead to many\nissues. Customer data stored in a centralized database may be tampered with so\nthe provenance and authenticity of data cannot be justified. Once the\naforementioned security concerns occur, the credibility of the trained AI\nmodels would be questionable and even unfavorable outcomes might be produced at\nthe test stage. Lately, blockchain and AI, the two core technologies in\nIndustry 4.0 and Web 3.0, have been explored to facilitate the decentralized AI\ntraining strategy. To serve on this very purpose, we propose a new system\narchitecture called APPFLChain, namely an integrated architecture of a\nHyperledger Fabric-based blockchain and a federated-learning paradigm. Our\nproposed new system allows different parties to jointly train AI models and\ntheir customers or stakeholders are connected by a consortium blockchain-based\nnetwork. Our new system can maintain a high degree of security and privacy as\nusers do not need to share sensitive personal information to the server. For\nnumerical evaluation, we simulate a real-world scenario to illustrate the whole\noperational process of APPFLChain.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a training method having multiple cyclic training for\nachieving enhanced performance in low-bit quantized convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs). Quantization is a popular method for obtaining lightweight\nCNNs, where the initialization with a pretrained model is widely used to\novercome degraded performance in low-resolution quantization. However, large\nquantization errors between real values and their low-bit quantized ones cause\ndifficulties in achieving acceptable performance for complex networks and large\ndatasets. The proposed training method softly delivers the knowledge of\npretrained models to low-bit quantized models in multiple quantization steps.\nIn each quantization step, the trained weights of a model are used to\ninitialize the weights of the next model with the quantization bit depth\nreduced by one. With small change of the quantization bit depth, the\nperformance gap can be bridged, thus providing better weight initialization. In\ncyclic training, after training a low-bit quantized model, its trained weights\nare used in the initialization of its accurate model to be trained. By using\nbetter training ability of the accurate model in an iterative manner, the\nproposed method can produce enhanced trained weights for the low-bit quantized\nmodel in each cycle. Notably, the training method can advance Top-1 and Top-5\naccuracies of the binarized ResNet-18 on the ImageNet dataset by 5.80% and\n6.85%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The increasing reliance on ML models in high-stakes tasks has raised a major\nconcern on fairness violations. Although there has been a surge of work that\nimproves algorithmic fairness, most of them are under the assumption of an\nidentical training and test distribution. In many real-world applications,\nhowever, such an assumption is often violated as previously trained fair models\nare often deployed in a different environment, and the fairness of such models\nhas been observed to collapse. In this paper, we study how to transfer model\nfairness under distribution shifts, a widespread issue in practice. We conduct\na fine-grained analysis of how the fair model is affected under different types\nof distribution shifts and find that domain shifts are more challenging than\nsubpopulation shifts. Inspired by the success of self-training in transferring\naccuracy under domain shifts, we derive a sufficient condition for transferring\ngroup fairness. Guided by it, we propose a practical algorithm with a fair\nconsistency regularization as the key component. A synthetic dataset benchmark,\nwhich covers all types of distribution shifts, is deployed for experimental\nverification of the theoretical findings. Experiments on synthetic and real\ndatasets including image and tabular data demonstrate that our approach\neffectively transfers fairness and accuracy under various distribution shifts.",

The current mainstream\napproach adopts multi-instance learning to predict Gleason grades. However,\nsome methods only considering the slide-level label ignore the limited\npixel-level labels containing rich local information. Furthermore, the method\nof additionally considering the pixel-level labels ignores the inaccuracy of\npixel-level labels.

The impact of inaccurate\ninstance-level labels is further reduced by introducing an efficient random\nmasking strategy in the mixed supervision training process.

    "abstract": "With more energy networks being interconnected to form integrated energy\nsystems (IESs), the optimal energy flow (OEF) problem has drawn increasing\nattention. Extant studies on OEF models mostly utilize the finite difference\nmethod (FDM) to deal with partial-differential-equation (PDE) constraints\nrelated to the dynamics in natural gas networks (NGNs) and district heating\nnetworks (DHNs). However, this time-domain approach suffers from a heavy\ncomputational burden with regard to achieving high finite-difference accuracy.\nIn this paper, a novel efficient OEF model is studied. First, by extending the\ncircuit modeling of electric power networks to NGNs and DHNs, an energy circuit\nmethod (ECM) that algebraizes the PDE models of NGNs and DHNs in the frequency\ndomain is introduced. Then, an ECM-based OEF model is formulated, which\ncontains fewer variables and constraints compared with an FDM-based OEF model\nand thereby yields better solving efficiency. Finally, variable space\nprojection is employed to remove implicit variables, by which another\nconstraint generation algorithm is enabled to remove redundant constraints.\nThese two techniques further compact the OEF model and bring about a second\nimprovement in solving efficiency. Numerical tests on large-scale IESs indicate\nthat the final OEF model reduces variables and constraints by more than 95% and\nimproves the solving efficiency by more than 10 times.

Great efforts have been made for automatic fake news detection on a\nsingle domain (e.g., politics).

Based on our analysis, we pose two challenges in\nmulti-domain fake news detection: 1) domain shift, caused by the discrepancy\namong domains in terms of words, emotions, styles, etc. 2) domain labeling\nincompleteness, stemming from the real-world categorization that only outputs\none single domain label, regardless of topic diversity of a news piece.

Existing studies mainly focus on designing more powerful encoders\n(e.g., graph neural network) to learn better representations. However, few\nefforts have been devoted to investigating the desired properties of\nrepresentations in CF, which is important to understand the rationale of\nexisting CF methods and design new learning objectives.

However,\nas pointed out by Mnich and van Bevern [Computers \\& Operations Research,\n2018], the parameterized complexity for the number $m$ of machines as a\nparameter remained open. We resolve this by showing that Interval Scheduling on\nUnrelated Machines is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the number $m$ of\nmachines. To this end, we prove W[1]-hardness with respect to $m$ of the\nspecial case where we have parallel machines with eligible machine sets for\njobs. This answers Open Problem 8 of Mnich and van Bevern's list of 15 open\nproblems in the parameterized complexity of scheduling [Computers \\& Operations\nResearch, 2018].\nFurthermore, we resolve the computational complexity status of the unweighted\nversion of Interval Scheduling on Unrelated Machines by proving that it is\nNP-complete. This answers an open question by Sung and Vlach [Journal of\nScheduling, 2005].",

    "abstract": "The streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) models are more popular and\nsuitable for voice-based applications. However, non-streaming models provide\nbetter performance as they look at the entire audio context. To leverage the\nbenefits of the non-streaming model in streaming applications like voice\nsearch, it is commonly used in second pass re-scoring mode. The candidate\nhypothesis generated using steaming models is re-scored using a non-streaming\nmodel. In this work, we evaluate the non-streaming attention-based end-to-end\nASR models on the Flipkart voice search task in both standalone and re-scoring\nmodes. These models are based on Listen-Attend-Spell (LAS) encoder-decoder\narchitecture. We experiment with different encoder variations based on LSTM,\nTransformer, and Conformer. We compare the latency requirements of these models\nalong with their performance. Overall we show that the Transformer model offers\nacceptable WER with the lowest latency requirements. We report a relative WER\nimprovement of around 16% with the second pass LAS re-scoring with latency\noverhead under 5ms. We also highlight the importance of CNN front-end with\nTransformer architecture to achieve comparable word error rates (WER).\nMoreover, we observe that in the second pass re-scoring mode all the encoders\nprovide similar benefits whereas the difference in performance is prominent in\nstandalone text generation mode.",

    "abstract": "Coded distributed computing (CDC) is a new technique proposed with the\npurpose of decreasing the intense data exchange required for parallelizing\ndistributed computing systems. Under the famous MapReduce paradigm, this coded\napproach has been shown to decrease this communication overhead by a factor\nthat is linearly proportional to the overall computation load during the\nmapping phase. Nevertheless, it is widely accepted that this overhead remains a\nmain bottleneck in distributed computing. To address this, we take a new\napproach and we explore a new system model which, for the same aforementioned\noverall computation load of the mapping phase, manages to provide astounding\nreductions of the communication overhead and, perhaps counterintuitively, a\nsubstantial increase of the computational parallelization. In particular, we\npropose multi-access distributed computing (MADC) as a novel generalization of\nthe original CDC model, where now mappers and reducers are distinct computing\nnodes that are connected through a multi-access network topology. Focusing on\nthe MADC setting with combinatorial topology, which implies $\\Lambda$ mappers\nand $K$ reducers such that there is a unique reducer connected to any $\\alpha$\nmappers, we propose a novel coded scheme and a novel information-theoretic\nconverse, which jointly identify the optimal inter-reducer communication load\nto within a constant gap of $1.5$. Additionally, a modified coded scheme and\nconverse identify the optimal max-link communication load across all existing\nlinks to within a gap of $4$. The unparalleled coding gains reported here\nshould not be simply credited to having access to more mapped data, but rather\nto the powerful role of topology in effectively aligning mapping outputs.

To address these issues, we propose a novel\nlength-flexible lightweight cancelable fingerprint template for\nprivacy-preserving authentication systems in various resource-constrained IoT\napplications.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of estimating link flows in a road network\nby combining limited traffic volume and vehicle trajectory data. While traffic\nvolume data from loop detectors have been the common data source for link flow\nestimation, the detectors only cover a subset of links. Vehicle trajectory data\ncollected from vehicle tracking sensors are also incorporated these days.\nHowever, trajectory data are often sparse in that the observed trajectories\nonly represent a small subset of the whole population, where the exact sampling\nrate is unknown and may vary over space and time. This study proposes a novel\ngenerative modelling framework, where we formulate the link-to-link movements\nof a vehicle as a sequential decision-making problem using the Markov Decision\nProcess framework and train an agent to make sequential decisions to generate\nrealistic synthetic vehicle trajectories. We use Reinforcement Learning\n(RL)-based methods to find the best behaviour of the agent, based on which\nsynthetic population vehicle trajectories can be generated to estimate link\nflows across the whole network. To ensure the generated population vehicle\ntrajectories are consistent with the observed traffic volume and trajectory\ndata, two methods based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Constrained\nReinforcement Learning are proposed. The proposed generative modelling\nframework solved by either of these RL-based methods is validated by solving\nthe link flow estimation problem in a real road network. Additionally, we\nperform comprehensive experiments to compare the performance with two existing\nmethods.

To date, there has been\nno empirical study of data augmentation on Alzheimer's disease (AD) datasets\nfor NLP and speech processing. In this work, we investigate data augmentation\ntechniques for the task of AD detection and perform an empirical evaluation of\nthe different approaches on two kinds of models for both the text and audio\ndomains. We use a transformer-based model for both domains, and SVM and Random\nForest models for the text and audio domains, respectively. We generate\nadditional samples using traditional as well as deep learning based methods and\nshow that data augmentation improves performance for both the text- and\naudio-based models and that such results are comparable to state-of-the-art\nresults on the popular ADReSS set, with carefully crafted architectures and\nfeatures.",

Most latent fingerprint enhancement methods try to\nrestore corrupted gray ridges/valleys. In this paper, we propose a new method\nthat formulates the latent fingerprint enhancement as a constrained fingerprint\ngeneration problem within a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework. We\nname the proposed network as FingerGAN. It can enforce its generated\nfingerprint (i.e, enhanced latent fingerprint) indistinguishable from the\ncorresponding ground-truth instance in terms of the fingerprint skeleton map\nweighted by minutia locations and the orientation field regularized by the\nFOMFE model. Because minutia is the primary feature for fingerprint recognition\nand minutia can be retrieved directly from the fingerprint skeleton map, we\noffer a holistic framework which can perform latent fingerprint enhancement in\nthe context of directly optimizing minutia information. This will help improve\nlatent fingerprint identification performance significantly. Experimental\nresults on two public latent fingerprint databases demonstrate that our method\noutperforms the state of the arts significantly.

Constrained by strict requirements on online\ninference efficiency, it is often difficult to deploy useful but\ncomputationally intensive modules such as long-term behaviors modeling. Most\nrecent works attempt to mitigate the online calculation issue of long\nhistorical behaviors by adopting two-stage methods to balance online efficiency\nand effectiveness. However, the information gaps caused by two-stage modeling\nmay result in a diminished performance gain. In this work, we propose a novel\nframework called PCM to address this challenge in the view of system\ndeployment.

Moreover, our framework has been\ndeployed into a large-scale real-world E-commerce system serving the main\ninterface of hundreds of millions of active users, by deploying long sequential\nuser behavior model in PCM.

This makes it a challenge\nfor FL to alleviate the single point of failure and dishonest clients. These\nimpending challenges in the design philosophy of FL call for blockchain-based\nfederated learning (BFL) due to the benefits of coupling FL and blockchain\n(e.g., democracy, incentive, and immutability). However, one problem in vanilla\nBFL is that its capabilities do not follow adopters' needs in a dynamic\nfashion. Besides, vanilla BFL relies on unverifiable clients' self-reported\ncontributions like data size because checking clients' raw data is not allowed\nin FL for privacy concerns. We design and evaluate a novel BFL framework, and\nresolve the identified challenges in vanilla BFL with greater flexibility and\nincentive mechanism called FAIR-BFL. In contrast to existing works, FAIR-BFL\noffers unprecedented flexibility via the modular design, allowing adopters to\nadjust its capabilities following business demands in a dynamic fashion.

Existing methods have demonstrated the PDE\nidentification from finite observations but failed to maintain satisfying\nperformance against noisy data, partly owing to suboptimal estimated\nderivatives and found PDE coefficients. We address the issues by introducing a\nnoise-aware physics-informed machine learning (nPIML) framework to discover the\ngoverning PDE from data following arbitrary distributions. Our proposals are\ntwofold. First, we propose a couple of neural networks, namely solver and\npreselector, which yield an interpretable neural representation of the hidden\nphysical constraint. After they are jointly trained, the solver network\napproximates potential candidates, e.g., partial derivatives, which are then\nfed to the sparse regression algorithm that initially unveils the most likely\nparsimonious PDE, decided according to the information criterion. Second, we\npropose the denoising physics-informed neural networks (dPINNs), based on\nDiscrete Fourier Transform (DFT), to deliver a set of the optimal finetuned PDE\ncoefficients respecting the noise-reduced variables. The denoising PINNs'\nstructures are compartmentalized into forefront projection networks and a PINN,\nby which the formerly learned solver initializes. Our extensive experiments on\nfive canonical PDEs affirm that the proposed framework presents a robust and\ninterpretable approach for PDE discovery, applicable to a wide range of\nsystems, possibly complicated by noise.",

    "abstract": "In many societal and industrial interactions, participants generally prefer\ntheir pure self-interest at the expense of the global welfare. Known as social\ndilemmas, this category of non-cooperative games offers situations where\nmultiple actors should all cooperate to achieve the best outcome but greed and\nfear lead to a worst self-interested issue. Recently, the emergence of Deep\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has generated revived interest in social dilemmas\nwith the introduction of Sequential Social Dilemma (SSD). Cooperative agents\nmixing RL policies and Tit-for-tat (TFT) strategies have successfully addressed\nsome non-optimal Nash equilibrium issues. However, this kind of paradigm\nrequires symmetrical and direct cooperation between actors, conditions that are\nnot met when mutual cooperation become asymmetric and is possible only with at\nleast a third actor in a circular way. To tackle this issue, this paper extends\nSSD with Circular Sequential Social Dilemma (CSSD), a new kind of Markov games\nthat better generalizes the diversity of cooperation between agents. Secondly,\nto address such circular and asymmetric cooperation, we propose a candidate\nsolution based on RL policies and a graph-based TFT. We conducted some\nexperiments on a simple multi-player grid world which offers adaptable\ncooperation structures.

We expand on our ongoing work to\noperationalize this definition and demonstrate how detecting disinformation\nmust extend beyond assessing the credibility of a specific publisher, user, or\nstory.",

    "abstract": "Learning unbiased node representations under class-imbalanced graph data is\nchallenging due to interactions between adjacent nodes. Existing studies have\nin common that they compensate the minor class nodes `as a group' according to\ntheir overall quantity (ignoring node connections in graph), which inevitably\nincrease the false positive cases for major nodes. We hypothesize that the\nincrease in these false positive cases is highly affected by the label\ndistribution around each node and confirm it experimentally. In addition, in\norder to handle this issue, we propose Topology-Aware Margin (TAM) to reflect\nlocal topology on the learning objective. Our method compares the connectivity\npattern of each node with the class-averaged counter-part and adaptively\nadjusts the margin accordingly based on that. Our method consistently exhibits\nsuperiority over the baselines on various node classification benchmark\ndatasets with representative GNN architectures.",

    "abstract": "Current methods for video activity localisation over time assume implicitly\nthat activity temporal boundaries labelled for model training are determined\nand precise. However, in unscripted natural videos, different activities mostly\ntransit smoothly, so that it is intrinsically ambiguous to determine in\nlabelling precisely when an activity starts and ends over time. Such\nuncertainties in temporal labelling are currently ignored in model training,\nresulting in learning mis-matched video-text correlation with poor\ngeneralisation in test. In this work, we solve this problem by introducing\nElastic Moment Bounding (EMB) to accommodate flexible and adaptive activity\ntemporal boundaries towards modelling universally interpretable video-text\ncorrelation with tolerance to underlying temporal uncertainties in pre-fixed\nannotations. Specifically, we construct elastic boundaries adaptively by mining\nand discovering frame-wise temporal endpoints that can maximise the alignment\nbetween video segments and query sentences. To enable both more robust matching\n(segment content attention) and more accurate localisation (segment elastic\nboundaries), we optimise the selection of frame-wise endpoints subject to\nsegment-wise contents by a novel Guided Attention mechanism. Extensive\nexperiments on three video activity localisation benchmarks demonstrate\ncompellingly the EMB's advantages over existing methods without modelling\nuncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformer (ViT) has shown its advantages over the convolutional\nneural network (CNN) with its ability to capture global long-range dependencies\nfor visual representation learning. Besides ViT, contrastive learning is\nanother popular research topic recently. While previous contrastive learning\nworks are mostly based on CNNs, some latest studies have attempted to jointly\nmodel the ViT and the contrastive learning for enhanced self-supervised\nlearning. Despite the considerable progress, these combinations of ViT and\ncontrastive learning mostly focus on the instance-level contrastiveness, which\noften overlook the contrastiveness of the global clustering structures and also\nlack the ability to directly learn the clustering result (e.g., for images). In\nview of this, this paper presents an end-to-end deep image clustering approach\ntermed Vision Transformer for Contrastive Clustering (VTCC), which for the\nfirst time, to the best of our knowledge, unifies the Transformer and the\ncontrastive learning for the image clustering task. Specifically, with two\nrandom augmentations performed on each image in a mini-batch, we utilize a ViT\nencoder with two weight-sharing views as the backbone to learn the\nrepresentations for the augmented samples. To remedy the potential instability\nof the ViT, we incorporate a convolutional stem, which uses multiple stacked\nsmall convolutions instead of a big convolution in the patch projection layer,\nto split each augmented sample into a sequence of patches. With representations\nlearned via the backbone, an instance projector and a cluster projector are\nfurther utilized for the instance-level contrastive learning and the global\nclustering structure learning, respectively. Extensive experiments on eight\nimage datasets demonstrate the stability (during the training-from-scratch) and\nthe superiority (in clustering performance) of VTCC over the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "In the past couple of decades, significant research efforts are devoted to\nthe prediction of software bugs (i.e., defects). These works leverage a diverse\nset of metrics, tools, and techniques to predict which classes, methods, lines,\nor commits are buggy. However, most existing work in this domain treats all\nbugs the same, which is not the case in practice. The more severe the bugs the\nhigher their consequences. Therefore, it is important for a defect prediction\nmethod to estimate the severity of the identified bugs, so that the higher\nseverity ones get immediate attention. In this paper, we provide a quantitative\nand qualitative study on two popular datasets (Defects4J and Bugs.jar), using\n10 common source code metrics, and also two popular static analysis tools\n(SpotBugs and Infer) for analyzing their capability in predicting defects and\ntheir severity. We studied 3,358 buggy methods with different severity labels\nfrom 19 Java open-source projects. Results show that although code metrics are\npowerful in predicting the buggy code (Lines of the Code, Maintainable Index,\nFanOut, and Effort metrics are the best), they cannot estimate the severity\nlevel of the bugs. In addition, we observed that static analysis tools have\nweak performance in both predicting bugs (F1 score range of 3.1%-7.1%) and\ntheir severity label (F1 score under 2%). We also manually studied the\ncharacteristics of the severe bugs to identify possible reasons behind the weak\nperformance of code metrics and static analysis tools in estimating the\nseverity. Also, our categorization shows that Security bugs have high severity\nin most cases while Edge/Boundary faults have low severity. Finally, we show\nthat code metrics and static analysis methods can be complementary in terms of\nestimating bug severity.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, several algorithms for system identification with neural\nstate-space models have been introduced.

Different sequences are then processed simultaneously within\na minibatch, taking advantage of modern parallel hardware for deep learning. An\nissue arising in these methods is the need to assign an initial state for each\nof the sub-sequences, which is required to run simulations and thus to evaluate\nthe fitting loss. In this paper, we provide insights for calibration of neural\nstate-space training algorithms based on extensive experimentation and analyses\nperformed on two recognized system identification benchmarks. Particular focus\nis given to the choice and the role of the initial state estimation.

We then\nprovide a systematic overview of the existing approaches to the challenges in\ncross-silo FL by focusing on their connections and differences to cross-device\nFL. Finally, we discuss future directions and open issues that merit research\nefforts from the community.",

Although such global optimality certificates have been well\nestablished for 3D pose-graph optimization, the details have yet to be worked\nout for the 3D landmark-based SLAM problem, in which estimated states include\nboth robot poses and map landmarks. In this paper, we address this gap by using\ngraph-theoretic approach to cast the subproblems of landmark-based SLAM into a\nform that yields a sufficient condition for global optimality. Efficient\nmethods of computing the optimality certificates for these subproblems exist,\nbut first require the construction of a large data matrix.

While numerous attack and defense\ntechniques have been developed, this work investigates the robustness issue\nfrom a new angle: can we design a self-healing neural network that can\nautomatically detect and fix the vulnerability issue by itself? A typical\nself-healing mechanism is the immune system of a human body. This\nbiology-inspired idea has been used in many engineering designs but is rarely\ninvestigated in deep learning. This paper considers the post-training\nself-healing of a neural network, and proposes a closed-loop control\nformulation to automatically detect and fix the errors caused by various\nattacks or perturbations. We provide a margin-based analysis to explain how\nthis formulation can improve the robustness of a classifier. To speed up the\ninference of the proposed self-healing network, we solve the control problem\nvia improving the Pontryagin Maximum Principle-based solver. Lastly, we present\nan error estimation of the proposed framework for neural networks with\nnonlinear activation functions. We validate the performance on several network\narchitectures against various perturbations. Since the self-healing method does\nnot need a-priori information about data perturbations/attacks, it can handle a\nbroad class of unforeseen perturbations.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, billions of user passwords have been exposed to the\ndangerous threat of offline password cracking attacks. An offline attacker who\nhas stolen the cryptographic hash of a user's password can check as many\npassword guesses as s/he likes limited only by the resources that s/he is\nwilling to invest to crack the password. Pepper and key-stretching are two\ntechniques that have been proposed to deter an offline attacker by increasing\nguessing costs. Pepper ensures that the cost of rejecting an incorrect password\nguess is higher than the (expected) cost of verifying a correct password guess.\nThis is useful because most of the offline attacker's guesses will be\nincorrect. Unfortunately, as we observe the traditional peppering defense seems\nto be incompatible with modern memory hard key-stretching algorithms such as\nArgon2 or Scrypt. We introduce an alternative to pepper which we call\nCost-Asymmetric Memory Hard Password Authentication which benefits from the\nsame cost-asymmetry as the classical peppering defense i.e., the cost of\nrejecting an incorrect password guess is larger than the expected cost to\nauthenticate a correct password guess. When configured properly we prove that\nour mechanism can only reduce the percentage of user passwords that are cracked\nby a rational offline attacker whose goal is to maximize (expected) profit\ni.e., the total value of cracked passwords minus the total guessing costs. We\nevaluate the effectiveness of our mechanism on empirical password datasets\nagainst a rational offline attacker. Our empirical analysis shows that our\nmechanism can reduce significantly the percentage of user passwords that are\ncracked by a rational attacker by up to 10%.",

To mitigate such instances, several models have been\ndeveloped to detect hate and offensive speech. Since detecting hate and\noffensive speech in social media platforms could incorrectly exclude\nindividuals from social media platforms, which can reduce trust, there is a\nneed to create explainable and interpretable models. Thus, we build an\nexplainable and interpretable high performance model based on the XGBoost\nalgorithm, trained on Twitter data. For unbalanced Twitter data, XGboost\noutperformed the LSTM, AutoGluon, and ULMFiT models on hate speech detection\nwith an F1 score of 0.75 compared to 0.38 and 0.37, and 0.38 respectively. When\nwe down-sampled the data to three separate classes of approximately 5000\ntweets, XGBoost performed better than LSTM, AutoGluon, and ULMFiT; with F1\nscores for hate speech detection of 0.79 vs 0.69, 0.77, and 0.66 respectively.\nXGBoost also performed better than LSTM, AutoGluon, and ULMFiT in the\ndown-sampled version for offensive speech detection with F1 score of 0.83 vs\n0.88, 0.82, and 0.79 respectively.

    "abstract": "Recently, several dense retrieval (DR) models have demonstrated competitive\nperformance to term-based retrieval that are ubiquitous in search systems. In\ncontrast to term-based matching, DR projects queries and documents into a dense\nvector space and retrieves results via (approximate) nearest neighbor search.\nDeploying a new system, such as DR, inevitably involves tradeoffs in aspects of\nits performance. Established retrieval systems running at scale are usually\nwell understood in terms of effectiveness and costs, such as query latency,\nindexing throughput, or storage requirements. In this work, we propose a\nframework with a set of criteria that go beyond simple effectiveness measures\nto thoroughly compare two retrieval systems with the explicit goal of assessing\nthe readiness of one system to replace the other. This includes careful\ntradeoff considerations between effectiveness and various cost factors.\nFurthermore, we describe guardrail criteria, since even a system that is better\non average may have systematic failures on a minority of queries. The\nguardrails check for failures on certain query characteristics and novel\nfailure types that are only possible in dense retrieval systems. We demonstrate\nour decision framework on a Web ranking scenario. In that scenario,\nstate-of-the-art DR models have surprisingly strong results, not only on\naverage performance but passing an extensive set of guardrail tests, showing\nrobustness on different query characteristics, lexical matching,\ngeneralization, and number of regressions. It is impossible to predict whether\nDR will become ubiquitous in the future, but one way this is possible is\nthrough repeated applications of decision processes such as the one presented\nhere.",

    "abstract": "We consider stochastic convex optimization for heavy-tailed data with the\nguarantee of being differentially private (DP). Prior work on this problem is\nrestricted to the gradient descent (GD) method, which is inefficient for\nlarge-scale problems. In this paper, we resolve this issue and derive the first\nhigh-probability bounds for private stochastic method with clipping. For\ngeneral convex problems, we derive excess population risks\n$\\Tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{d^{1/7}\\sqrt{\\ln\\frac{(n \\epsilon)^2}{\\beta\nd}}}{(n\\epsilon)^{2/7}}\\right)$ and\n$\\Tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{d^{1/7}\\ln\\frac{(n\\epsilon)^2}{\\beta\nd}}{(n\\epsilon)^{2/7}}\\right)$ under bounded or unbounded domain assumption,\nrespectively (here $n$ is the sample size, $d$ is the dimension of the data,\n$\\beta$ is the confidence level and $\\epsilon$ is the private level). Then, we\nextend our analysis to the strongly convex case and non-smooth case (which\nworks for generalized smooth objectives with H$\\ddot{\\text{o}}$lder-continuous\ngradients).

    "abstract": "In Urban Air Mobility (UAM) networks, takeoff and landing sites, called\nvertiports, are likely to experience intermittent closures due to, e.g.,\nadverse weather. To ensure safety, all in-flight Urban Air Vehicles (UAVs) in a\nUAM network must therefore have alternative landing sites with sufficient\nlanding capacity in the event of a vertiport closure. In this paper, we study\nthe problem of safety verification of UAM schedules in the face of vertiport\nclosures. We first provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a given UAM\nschedule to be safe in the sense that, if a vertiport closure occurs, then all\nUAVs will be able to safely land at a backup landing site. Next, we convert\nthese conditions to an efficient algorithm for verifying safety of a UAM\nschedule via a linear program by using properties of totally unimodular\nmatrices. Our algorithm allows for uncertain travel time between UAM vertiports\nand scales quadratically with the number of scheduled UAVs. We demonstrate our\nalgorithm on a UAM network with up to 1,000 UAVs.",

    "abstract": "In most of practical scenarios, the announcement system must deliver speech\nmessages in a noisy environment, in which the background noise cannot be\ncancelled out. The local noise reduces speech intelligibility and increases\nlistening effort of the listener, hence hamper the effectiveness of\nannouncement system. There has been reported that voices of professional\nannouncers are clearer and more comprehensive than that of non-expert speakers\nin noisy environment. This finding suggests that the speech intelligibility\nmight be related to the speaking style of professional announcer, which can be\nadapted using voice conversion method. Motivated by this idea, this paper\nproposes a speech intelligibility enhancement in noisy environment by applying\nvoice conversion method on non-professional voice. We discovered that the\nprofessional announcers and non-professional speakers are clusterized into\ndifferent clusters on the speaker embedding plane. This implies that the speech\nintelligibility can be controlled as an independent feature of speaker\nindividuality. To examine the advantage of converted voice in noisy\nenvironment, we experimented using test words masked in pink noise at different\nSNR levels. The results of objective and subjective evaluations confirm that\nthe speech intelligibility of converted voice is higher than that of original\nvoice in low SNR conditions.",

To exploit this effect, the model\nprediction-based methods have been widely adopted, which aim to exploit the\noutputs of DNNs in the early stage of learning to correct noisy labels.\nHowever, we observe that the model will make mistakes during label prediction,\nresulting in unsatisfactory performance. By contrast, the produced features in\nthe early stage of learning show better robustness. Inspired by this\nobservation, in this paper, we propose a novel feature embedding-based method\nfor deep learning with label noise, termed LabEl NoiseDilution (LEND). To be\nspecific, we first compute a similarity matrix based on current embedded\nfeatures to capture the local structure of training data. Then, the noisy\nsupervision signals carried by mislabeled data are overwhelmed by nearby\ncorrectly labeled ones (\\textit{i.e.}, label noise dilution), of which the\neffectiveness is guaranteed by the inherent robustness of feature embedding.\nFinally, the training data with diluted labels are further used to train a\nrobust classifier.

An immediate consequence is the\nsimplification of the algorithm for extracting substrings of an\nRLSLP-compressed string.

    "title": "Multi-Scale Spatial Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for  Skeleton-Based Action Recognition",
    "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks have been widely used for skeleton-based action\nrecognition due to their excellent modeling ability of non-Euclidean data. As\nthe graph convolution is a local operation, it can only utilize the short-range\njoint dependencies and short-term trajectory but fails to directly model the\ndistant joints relations and long-range temporal information that are vital to\ndistinguishing various actions. To solve this problem, we present a multi-scale\nspatial graph convolution (MS-GC) module and a multi-scale temporal graph\nconvolution (MT-GC) module to enrich the receptive field of the model in\nspatial and temporal dimensions. Concretely, the MS-GC and MT-GC modules\ndecompose the corresponding local graph convolution into a set of sub-graph\nconvolution, forming a hierarchical residual architecture. Without introducing\nadditional parameters, the features will be processed with a series of\nsub-graph convolutions, and each node could complete multiple spatial and\ntemporal aggregations with its neighborhoods. The final equivalent receptive\nfield is accordingly enlarged, which is capable of capturing both short- and\nlong-range dependencies in spatial and temporal domains. By coupling these two\nmodules as a basic block, we further propose a multi-scale spatial temporal\ngraph convolutional network (MST-GCN), which stacks multiple blocks to learn\neffective motion representations for action recognition. The proposed MST-GCN\nachieves remarkable performance on three challenging benchmark datasets, NTU\nRGB+D, NTU-120 RGB+D and Kinetics-Skeleton, for skeleton-based action\nrecognition.",

    "abstract": "With recent advances in machine learning, researchers are now able to solve\ntraditional problems with new solutions. In the area of digital watermarking,\ndeep-learning-based watermarking technique is being extensively studied. Most\nexisting approaches adopt a similar encoder-driven scheme which we name END\n(Encoder-NoiseLayer-Decoder) architecture. In this paper, we revamp the\narchitecture and creatively design a decoder-driven watermarking network dubbed\nDe-END which greatly outperforms the existing END-based methods. The motivation\nfor designing De-END originated from the potential drawback we discovered in\nEND architecture: The encoder may embed redundant features that are not\nnecessary for decoding, limiting the performance of the whole network. We\nconducted a detailed analysis and found that such limitations are caused by\nunsatisfactory coupling between the encoder and decoder in END. De-END\naddresses such drawbacks by adopting a Decoder-Encoder-Noiselayer-Decoder\narchitecture. In De-END, the host image is firstly processed by the decoder to\ngenerate a latent feature map instead of being directly fed into the encoder.\nThis latent feature map is concatenated to the original watermark message and\nthen processed by the encoder. This change in design is crucial as it makes the\nfeature of encoder and decoder directly shared thus the encoder and decoder are\nbetter coupled. We conducted extensive experiments and the results show that\nthis framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) END-based deep\nlearning watermarking both in visual quality and robustness. On the premise of\nthe same decoder structure, the visual quality (measured by PSNR) of De-END\nimproves by 1.6dB (45.16dB to 46.84dB), and extraction accuracy after JPEG\ncompression (QF=50) distortion outperforms more than 4% (94.9% to 99.1%).",

In this paper, we study two algorithms for this purpose, i.e., DP-SGD and\nDP-NSGD, which first clip or normalize \\textit{per-sample} gradients to bound\nthe sensitivity and then add noise to obfuscate the exact information. We\nanalyze the convergence behavior of these two algorithms in the non-convex\noptimization setting with two common assumptions and achieve a rate\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{d\\log(1/\\delta)}{N^2\\epsilon^2}}\\right)$ of\nthe gradient norm for a $d$-dimensional model, $N$ samples and\n$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP, which improves over previous bounds under much weaker\nassumptions.

Our proof deliberately handles the per-sample gradient\nclipping and normalization that are specified for the private setting.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate that these two algorithms achieve similar best\naccuracy while DP-NSGD is comparatively easier to tune than DP-SGD and hence\nmay help further save the privacy budget when accounting the tuning effort.",

    "abstract": "Outsourcing anomaly detection to third-parties can allow data owners to\novercome resource constraints (e.g., in lightweight IoT devices), facilitate\ncollaborative analysis (e.g., under distributed or multi-party scenarios), and\nbenefit from lower costs and specialized expertise (e.g., of Managed Security\nService Providers). Despite such benefits, a data owner may feel reluctant to\noutsource anomaly detection without sufficient privacy protection. To that end,\nmost existing privacy solutions would face a novel challenge, i.e., preserving\nprivacy usually requires the difference between data entries to be eliminated\nor reduced, whereas anomaly detection critically depends on that difference.\nSuch a conflict is recently resolved under a local analysis setting with\ntrusted analysts (where no outsourcing is involved) through moving the focus of\ndifferential privacy (DP) guarantee from \"all\" to only \"benign\" entries. In\nthis paper, we observe that such an approach is not directly applicable to the\noutsourcing setting, because data owners do not know which entries are \"benign\"\nprior to outsourcing, and hence cannot selectively apply DP on data entries.\nTherefore, we propose a novel iterative solution for the data owner to\ngradually \"disentangle\" the anomalous entries from the benign ones such that\nthe third-party analyst can produce accurate anomaly results with sufficient DP\nguarantee.

An approach to overcome this roadblock is to\nanonymize the event log so that no individual represented in the original log\ncan be singled out based on the anonymized one. Differential privacy is an\nanonymization approach that provides this guarantee. A differentially private\nevent log anonymization technique seeks to produce an anonymized log that is as\nsimilar as possible to the original one (high utility) while providing a\nrequired privacy guarantee. Existing event log anonymization techniques operate\nby injecting noise into the traces in the log (e.g., duplicating, perturbing,\nor filtering out some traces). Recent work on differential privacy has shown\nthat a better privacy-utility tradeoff can be achieved by applying subsampling\nprior to noise injection. In other words, subsampling amplifies privacy. This\npaper proposes an event log anonymization approach called Libra that exploits\nthis observation. Libra extracts multiple samples of traces from a log,\nindependently injects noise, retains statistically relevant traces from each\nsample, and composes the samples to produce a differentially private log. An\nempirical evaluation shows that the proposed approach leads to a considerably\nhigher utility for equivalent privacy guarantees relative to existing\nbaselines.",

    "abstract": "The popularity of Electric Vehicles (EVs) has been rising across the globe in\nrecent years. Smart grids will be the backbone for EV charging and enable\nefficient consumption of electricity by the EVs. With the demand for EVs,\nassociated cyber threats are also increasing. Users expose their personal\ninformation while charging their EVs, leading to privacy threats. This paper\nproposes a user-empowered, privacy-aware authenticated key exchange protocol\nfor EV charging in smart grid. The proposed protocol is based on the concept of\nDecentralized Identifier (DID) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). The use of\nDIDs empowers users by helping them to have complete control over their\nidentities. The charging station and the user verify that the other party is\nlegitimate before proceeding with the charging services using VC. Key recovery\nis another issue we address in this paper. A method to recover lost keys is\nincorporated into the proposed protocol. We present formal security proof and\ninformal analysis to show that protocol's robustness against several attacks.\nWe also provide a detailed performance analysis to show that the proposed\nprotocol is efficient.",

A peripheral nervous\nsystem appears as a diffusively connected system of mathematical models of\nneuron models, and the system's period becomes shorter than the periods of each\nneural circuit. The stimuli in the conduction path that will address the myelin\nsheath that has lost its function are received by the axons and are conveyed\nexternally to the target organ, aiming to solve the problem of decreased nerve\nconduction. In the NEURON simulation environment, one can create a neuron model\nand define biophysical events that take place within the system for study. In\nthis environment, signal transmission between cells and dendrites is obtained\ngraphically. The simulated potassium and sodium conductance are replicated\nadequately, and the electronic action potentials are quite comparable to those\nmeasured experimentally. In this work, we propose an analog and digital coupled\nneuron model comprising individual excitatory and inhibitory neural circuit\nblocks for a low-cost and energy-efficient system. Compared to digital design,\nour analog design performs in lower frequency but gives a 32.3\\% decreased\nenergy efficiency. Thus, the resulting coupled analog hardware neuron model can\nbe a proposed model for the simulation of reduced nerve conduction.

We consider a general adversarial\ndecision making framework that encompasses (structured) bandit problems with\nadversarial rewards and reinforcement learning problems with adversarial\ndynamics. Our main result is to show -- via new upper and lower bounds -- that\nthe Decision-Estimation Coefficient, a complexity measure introduced by Foster\net al. in the stochastic counterpart to our setting, is necessary and\nsufficient to obtain low regret for adversarial decision making. However,\ncompared to the stochastic setting, one must apply the Decision-Estimation\nCoefficient to the convex hull of the class of models (or, hypotheses) under\nconsideration. This establishes that the price of accommodating adversarial\nrewards or dynamics is governed by the behavior of the model class under\nconvexification, and recovers a number of existing results -- both positive and\nnegative.

The objective of the system is to generate\ninteractively controllable sound models given (a) a range of sounds the model\nshould be able to synthesize, and (b) a specification of the parametric\ncontrols for navigating that space of sounds. The range of sounds is defined by\na dataset provided by the designer, while the means of navigation is defined by\na combination of data labels and the selection of a sub-manifold from the\nlatent space learned by the GAN. Our proposed system takes advantage of the\nrich latent space of a GAN that consists of sounds that fill out the spaces\n''between\" real data-like sounds. This augmented data from the GAN is then used\nto train an RNN for its ability to respond immediately and continuously to\nparameter changes and to generate audio over unlimited periods of time.\nFurthermore, we develop a self-organizing map technique for ``smoothing\" the\nlatent space of GAN that results in perceptually smooth interpolation between\naudio timbres. We validate this process through user studies. The system\ncontributes advances to the state of the art for generative sound model design\nthat include system configuration and components for improving interpolation\nand the expansion of audio modeling capabilities beyond musical pitch and\npercussive instrument sounds into the more complex space of audio textures.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Miller et al. showed that a model's in-distribution (ID) accuracy\nhas a strong linear correlation with its out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy on\nseveral OOD benchmarks -- a phenomenon they dubbed ''accuracy-on-the-line''.\nWhile a useful tool for model selection (i.e., the model most likely to perform\nthe best OOD is the one with highest ID accuracy), this fact does not help\nestimate the actual OOD performance of models without access to a labeled OOD\nvalidation set. In this paper, we show a similar but surprising phenomenon also\nholds for the agreement between pairs of neural network classifiers: whenever\naccuracy-on-the-line holds, we observe that the OOD agreement between the\npredictions of any two pairs of neural networks (with potentially different\narchitectures) also observes a strong linear correlation with their ID\nagreement. Furthermore, we observe that the slope and bias of OOD vs ID\nagreement closely matches that of OOD vs ID accuracy. This phenomenon, which we\ncall agreement-on-the-line, has important practical applications: without any\nlabeled data, we can predict the OOD accuracy of classifiers}, since OOD\nagreement can be estimated with just unlabeled data. Our prediction algorithm\noutperforms previous methods both in shifts where agreement-on-the-line holds\nand, surprisingly, when accuracy is not on the line. This phenomenon also\nprovides new insights into deep neural networks: unlike accuracy-on-the-line,\nagreement-on-the-line appears to only hold for neural network classifiers.",

In this work, we move toward the answer with one\nmore step by connecting zero stability and model performance. Specifically, we\nfound that if a discrete solver of an ordinary differential equation is zero\nstable, the CNN corresponding to that solver performs well. We first give the\ninterpretation of zero stability in the context of deep learning and then\ninvestigate the performance of existing first- and second-order CNNs under\ndifferent zero-stable circumstances. Based on the preliminary observation, we\nprovide a higher-order discretization to construct CNNs and then propose a\nzero-stable network (ZeroSNet). To guarantee zero stability of the ZeroSNet, we\nfirst deduce a structure that meets consistency conditions and then give a zero\nstable region of a training-free parameter. By analyzing the roots of a\ncharacteristic equation, we theoretically obtain the optimal coefficients of\nfeature maps. Empirically, we present our results from three aspects: We\nprovide extensive empirical evidence of different depth on different datasets\nto show that the moduli of the characteristic equation's roots are the keys for\nthe performance of CNNs that require historical features; Our experiments show\nthat ZeroSNet outperforms existing CNNs which is based on high-order\ndiscretization; ZeroSNets show better robustness against noises on the input.\nThe source code is available at \\url{https://github.com/LongJin-lab/ZeroSNet}.",

We formalize these dynamics in what we call an\nexposure game, a model of incentives induced by algorithms including modern\nfactorization and (deep) two-tower architectures. We prove that seemingly\ninnocuous algorithmic choices -- e.g., non-negative vs. unconstrained\nfactorization -- significantly affect the existence and character of (Nash)\nequilibria in exposure games.

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are capable of finding the solution\nfor a given boundary value problem. We employ several ideas from the finite\nelement method (FEM) to enhance the performance of existing PINNs in\nengineering problems. The main contribution of the current work is to promote\nusing the spatial gradient of the primary variable as an output from separated\nneural networks. Later on, the strong form which has a higher order of\nderivatives is applied to the spatial gradients of the primary variable as the\nphysical constraint. In addition, the so-called energy form of the problem is\napplied to the primary variable as an additional constraint for training. The\nproposed approach only required up to first-order derivatives to construct the\nphysical loss functions. We discuss why this point is beneficial through\nvarious comparisons between different models. The mixed formulation-based PINNs\nand FE methods share some similarities. While the former minimizes the PDE and\nits energy form at given collocation points utilizing a complex nonlinear\ninterpolation through a neural network, the latter does the same at element\nnodes with the help of shape functions. We focus on heterogeneous solids to\nshow the capability of deep learning for predicting the solution in a complex\nenvironment under different boundary conditions. The performance of the\nproposed PINN model is checked against the solution from FEM on two prototype\nproblems: elasticity and the Poisson equation (steady-state diffusion problem).\nWe concluded that by properly designing the network architecture in PINN, the\ndeep learning model has the potential to solve the unknowns in a heterogeneous\ndomain without any available initial data from other sources.

In this paper, we investigate how\nattackers could mislead trust prediction via manipulating signed graphs while\nremaining secret.

The attacks are formulated as\nhard bi-level optimization problems, for which we propose several efficient\napproximation solutions. The resulting basic attacks would severely change the\nstructural semantics (in particular, both local and global balance properties)\nof a signed graph, which makes the attacks prone to be detected by the powerful\nattack detectors we designed. To address this issue, we further refine the\nbasic attacks by integrating some conflicting metrics as penalty terms into the\nobjective function. The refined attacks become secrecy-aware: they can\nsuccessfully evade attack detectors with high probability while sacrificing\nlittle attack performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate\nthat the basic attacks can severely disrupt trust prediction, the basic attacks\ncould be easily detected, and the refined attacks can preserve attack\nperformance while evading detection.

Through a carefully contrived payoff function\nmisreported to the learning leader, the follower may induce an outcome that\nbenefits him more, compared to the ones when he truthfully behaves.\nWe study the follower's optimal manipulation via such strategic behaviors in\nextensive-form games. Followers' different attitudes are taken into account. An\noptimistic follower maximizes his true utility among all game outcomes that can\nbe induced by some payoff function. A pessimistic follower only considers\nmisreporting payoff functions that induce a unique game outcome. For all the\nsettings considered in this paper, we characterize all the possible game\noutcomes that can be induced successfully. We show that it is polynomial-time\ntractable for the follower to find the optimal way of misreporting his private\npayoff information. Our work completely resolves this follower's optimal\nmanipulation problem on an extensive-form game tree.",

Specifically, we address the issue of accurately\npredicting the probability of a future connection between two robots equipped\nwith range-based measurement devices. Due to the limited range of the equipped\nsensors, edges in the network connection topology will be created or destroyed\nas the robots move with respect to one another.

An adaptive power series expansion\n(or APSE) algorithm is developed based on current estimates and control\ncandidates. Such an algorithm applies the power series expansion formula of the\nquadratic positive form in a normal distribution. Finite-term approximation is\nmade to realize the computational tractability. Further analyses are presented\nto show that the truncation error in the finite-term approximation can be\ntheoretically reduced to a desired threshold by adaptively choosing the\nsummation degree of the power series. Several sufficient conditions are\nrigorously derived as the selection principles.

    "abstract": "Supervised learning can be viewed as distilling relevant information from\ninput data into feature representations. This process becomes difficult when\nsupervision is noisy as the distilled information might not be relevant. In\nfact, recent research shows that networks can easily overfit all labels\nincluding those that are corrupted, and hence can hardly generalize to clean\ndatasets. In this paper, we focus on the problem of learning with noisy labels\nand introduce compression inductive bias to network architectures to alleviate\nthis over-fitting problem. More precisely, we revisit one classical\nregularization named Dropout and its variant Nested Dropout. Dropout can serve\nas a compression constraint for its feature dropping mechanism, while Nested\nDropout further learns ordered feature representations w.r.t. feature\nimportance. Moreover, the trained models with compression regularization are\nfurther combined with Co-teaching for performance boost.\nTheoretically, we conduct bias-variance decomposition of the objective\nfunction under compression regularization. We analyze it for both single model\nand Co-teaching. This decomposition provides three insights: (i) it shows that\nover-fitting is indeed an issue for learning with noisy labels; (ii) through an\ninformation bottleneck formulation, it explains why the proposed feature\ncompression helps in combating label noise; (iii) it gives explanations on the\nperformance boost brought by incorporating compression regularization into\nCo-teaching. Experiments show that our simple approach can have comparable or\neven better performance than the state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks with\nreal-world label noise including Clothing1M and ANIMAL-10N.

VSNs are mobile social\nnetworks that aim to create social links among travellers on the roads. Besides\nmatching interests between two users, social trust is essential to successfully\nestablish and nurture a social relationship. However, the unique\ncharacteristics of VSNs pose many challenges such as uncertainty, subjectivity\nand intransitivity to indirect social trust modelling. Furthermore, the current\ntrust models in the literature inadequately address trust propagation in VSNs.\nWe propose a novel indirect social trust model for VSNs using evolving graph\ntheory and the Paillier cryptosystem. We consider the VSN as a highly dynamic\nsocial evolving graph where social ties among vehicles hold a trustworthiness\nfactor that evolves over time. This factor is estimated based on the\nbehaviours, opinions, distances, and communication metrics of the parties\ninvolved. Employing the homomorphic property of the Paillier cryptosystem, the\nproposed model targets the subjectivity problem when combining multiple\nopinions to establish an indirect trusted relationship.

    "abstract": "With the growth in popularity of cloud computing, object storage systems\n(e.g., Amazon S3, OpenStack Swift, Ceph) have gained momentum for their\nrelatively low per-GB costs and high availability. However, as increasingly\nmore sensitive data is being accrued, the need to natively integrate privacy\ncontrols into the storage is growing in relevance. Today, due to the poor\nobject storage interface, privacy controls are enforced by data curators with\nfull access to data in the clear. This motivates the need for a new approach to\ndata privacy that can provide strong assurance and control to data owners. To\nfulfill this need, this paper presents EGEON, a novel software-defined data\nprotection framework for object storage. EGEON enables users to declaratively\nset privacy policies on how their data can be shared. In the privacy policies,\nthe users can build complex data protection services through the composition of\ndata transformations, which are invoked inline by EGEON upon a read request. As\na result, data owners can trivially display multiple views from the same data\npiece, and modify these views by only updating the policies. And all without\nrestructuring the internals of the underlying object storage system. The EGEON\nprototype has been built atop OpenStack Swift. Evaluation results shows promise\nin developing data protection services with little overhead directly into the\nobject store. Further, depending on the amount of data filtered out in the\ntransformed views, end-to-end latency can be low due to the savings in network\ncommunication.",

    "abstract": "Since spectrum below 6 GHz bands does not suffice to meet the high bandwidth\nrequirements of 5G use cases, 5G networks expand their operation to mmWave\nbands with multi-GHz of available spectrum. However, operation at mmWave bands\nraises two challenges: high penetration loss and susceptibility to objects\nblocking the line-of-sight. As a remedy, transmitters point their antennas to\ntheir receivers using beamforming to contain the signal in the direction of the\nintended receiver. To avoid loss of connectivity due to blockers or other\nfactors such as rain, users can be connected to multiple base stations (BS).\nWhile these two features, beamforming and multi-connectivity, can mitigate the\nchallenges of mmWave bands, it is not trivial to find the optimal user\nassociation which can maintain the minimum rate requirements of the users. In\nthis paper, we first formulate a throughput-maximizing user association scheme\nconsidering beamforming and multi-connectivity, and investigate the behavior of\nthe optimal scheme to devise a simple, yet efficient heuristic that does not\nrequire global network information. Our proposal, dubbed beam-align, which only\nuses local information at a BS, performs close to the optimal in terms of\nper-user capacity and user satisfaction levels and has only polynomial\ncomplexity. Our numerical analysis shows that beam-align outperforms the\nfrequently-used association schemes based on SNR. To investigate the\nperformance of beam-align also under various challenging settings, we consider\nthree scenarios: presence of blockers, different levels of rain intensity, and\npresence of clustered users. From simulations, we observe that beam-align is\nrobust against different conditions, as it maintains a stable performance under\nthe studied scenarios.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, specific evaluation metrics for time series anomaly\ndetection algorithms have been developed to handle the limitations of the\nclassical precision and recall. However, such metrics are heuristically built\nas an aggregate of multiple desirable aspects, introduce parameters and wipe\nout the interpretability of the output. In this article, we first highlight the\nlimitations of the classical precision/recall, as well as the main issues of\nthe recent event-based metrics -- for instance, we show that an adversary\nalgorithm can reach high precision and recall on almost any dataset under weak\nassumption. To cope with the above problems, we propose a theoretically\ngrounded, robust, parameter-free and interpretable extension to\nprecision/recall metrics, based on the concept of ``affiliation'' between the\nground truth and the prediction sets. Our metrics leverage measures of duration\nbetween ground truth and predictions, and have thus an intuitive\ninterpretation. By further comparison against random sampling, we obtain a\nnormalized precision/recall, quantifying how much a given set of results is\nbetter than a random baseline prediction. By construction, our approach keeps\nthe evaluation local regarding ground truth events, enabling fine-grained\nvisualization and interpretation of algorithmic results. We compare our\nproposal against various public time series anomaly detection datasets,\nalgorithms and metrics. We further derive theoretical properties of the\naffiliation metrics that give explicit expectations about their behavior and\nensure robustness against adversary strategies.",

    "abstract": "There is a rapid increase in the cooperative learning paradigm in online\nlearning settings, i.e., federated learning (FL). Unlike most FL settings,\nthere are many situations where the agents are competitive. Each agent would\nlike to learn from others, but the part of the information it shares for others\nto learn from could be sensitive; thus, it desires its privacy. This work\ninvestigates a group of agents working concurrently to solve similar\ncombinatorial bandit problems while maintaining quality constraints. Can these\nagents collectively learn while keeping their sensitive information\nconfidential by employing differential privacy? We observe that communicating\ncan reduce the regret. However, differential privacy techniques for protecting\nsensitive information makes the data noisy and may deteriorate than help to\nimprove regret. Hence, we note that it is essential to decide when to\ncommunicate and what shared data to learn to strike a functional balance\nbetween regret and privacy. For such a federated combinatorial MAB setting, we\npropose a Privacy-preserving Federated Combinatorial Bandit algorithm, P-FCB.\nWe illustrate the efficacy of P-FCB through simulations.

It is essential to report the changes of each\nreplication to understand the evolution of the experimental validity across a\nfamily of studies. Unfortunately, the lack of proposals undermines these\nobjectives.\nObjective. The main goal of our work is to provide researchers in CS, and in\nother areas of research, with a systematic, tool-supported approach for the\nreporting of changes in the replications of their empirical studies.\nMethod: Applying DSR, we have developed and validated a composite artifact\nconsisting of (i) a metamodel of the relevant concepts of replications and\ntheir changes; (ii) templates and linguistic patterns for reporting those\nconcepts; and (iii) a proof-of-concept model-based software tool that supports\nthe proposed approach. For its validation, we have carried out a multiple case\nstudy including 9 families of empirical studies from CS and Agrobiology. The 9\nfamilies encompass 23 replication studies and 92 replication changes, for which\nwe have analyzed the suitability of our proposal.\nResults: The multiple case study revealed some initial limitations of our\napproach related to threats to experimental validity or context variables.\nAfter several improvement iterations, all the 92 replication changes could be\nproperly specified, including also their qualitatively estimated effects on\nexperimental validity across the family of experiments and its corresponding\nvisualization.\nConclusions: Our proposal for the specification of replication changes seems\nto fit the needs not only of replications in CS, but also in other research\nareas.

Second, through the example of\nembryo development imaging dataset, we detail the construction and\nvisualization of a STC based on a user-driven projection of the spatial and\ntemporal information. This projection yields a 3D STC visualization, which can\nalso encode additional numerical and categorical data. Additionally, we propose\na set of tools allowing the user to filter and manipulate the 3D STC which\nbenefits from the visualization, exploration and interaction possibilities\noffered by VR. Finally, we evaluated the proposed visualization method in the\ncontext of the visualization of spatio-temporal biological data. Several\nbiology experts accompanied the application design to provide insight on how\nthe STC visualization could be used to explore such data. We report a user\nstudy (n=12) using non-expert users performing a set of exploration and query\ntasks to evaluate the system.",

    "title": "Few-Shot Stance Detection via Target-Aware Prompt Distillation",
    "abstract": "Stance detection aims to identify whether the author of a text is in favor\nof, against, or neutral to a given target. The main challenge of this task\ncomes two-fold: few-shot learning resulting from the varying targets and the\nlack of contextual information of the targets. Existing works mainly focus on\nsolving the second issue by designing attention-based models or introducing\nnoisy external knowledge, while the first issue remains under-explored. In this\npaper, inspired by the potential capability of pre-trained language models\n(PLMs) serving as knowledge bases and few-shot learners, we propose to\nintroduce prompt-based fine-tuning for stance detection. PLMs can provide\nessential contextual information for the targets and enable few-shot learning\nvia prompts. Considering the crucial role of the target in stance detection\ntask, we design target-aware prompts and propose a novel verbalizer. Instead of\nmapping each label to a concrete word, our verbalizer maps each label to a\nvector and picks the label that best captures the correlation between the\nstance and the target. Moreover, to alleviate the possible defect of dealing\nwith varying targets with a single hand-crafted prompt, we propose to distill\nthe information learned from multiple prompts. Experimental results show the\nsuperior performance of our proposed model in both full-data and few-shot\nscenarios.",

With such an influence on the game, referees have no room for a\nmistake. It is also a very rare event, which happens 1-2 times per 100 pass\nattempts. With technology improving and many IoT wearables being put on the\nathletes to collect valuable data, there is a solid ground for applying machine\nlearning (ML) techniques to improve every aspect of the game. The work\npresented here is the first attempt in predicting DPI using player tracking GPS\ndata. The data we used was collected by NFL's Next Gen Stats throughout the\n2018 regular season. We present ML models for highly imbalanced time-series\nbinary classification: LSTM, GRU, ANN, and Multivariate LSTM-FCN. Results\nshowed that using GPS tracking data to predict DPI has limited success. The\nbest performing models had high recall with low precision which resulted in the\nclassification of many false positive examples. Looking closely at the data\nconfirmed that there is just not enough information to determine whether a foul\nwas committed.

    "abstract": "Many granular products have the shape of surface of revolution (SR), typical\nexamples include round pharmaceutical tablets, shelled capsules and M\\&M\ncandies. Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations are often applied to speed\nup the study of optimized design parameters along with experiments in the\nparticle processing. For this purpose, a novel Surface of Revolution Discrete\nElement Method (SR-DEM) to simulate granular system with SR particles (i.e.\nsolids of revolution) is developed for this shape family. As surface of\nrevolution is generated by rotating a plane curve around an axis of rotation\nthat lies on the same plane, the shape of any cross section through the axis of\nrotation remains unchanged because of azimuthal symmetry. Taking advantage of\nthis unique geometry feature, the contact detection and overlap distance\nevaluation between SR particles can be handled in 2D space for accurate and\nefficient DEM simulations.\nIn this paper, a node-to-cross-section contact algorithm is proposed to\ncompute the contact force between a pair of SR particles, whereby surface nodes\nare seeded on the master particle, and cross-section of the slave particle\nthrough the axis of rotation is converted into a signed distance field (SDF).\nSigned distance value of a master node in the slave's cross-section SDF can be\nused in the contact resolution. The developed SR-DEM code is validated by\nmultiple cases, including particle-wall, particle-particle collisions, static\npacking of bi-convex tablets and M\\&M candies in a cylindrical container, and\ndynamic angle of repose of these two type of particles in a rotating drum. The\nnumerical results illustrate that the proposed framework is accurate and\nefficient for the DEM simulation of SR particles.",

    "abstract": "Depression is one of the most common mental disorders, which imposes heavy\nnegative impacts on one's daily life. Diagnosing depression based on the\ninterview is usually in the form of questions and answers. In this process, the\naudio signals and their text transcripts of a subject are correlated to\ndepression cues and easily recorded. Therefore, it is feasible to build an\nAutomatic Depression Detection (ADD) model based on the data of these\nmodalities in practice. However, there are two major challenges that should be\naddressed for constructing an effective ADD model. The first challenge is the\norganization of the textual and audio data, which can be of various contents\nand lengths for different subjects. The second challenge is the lack of\ntraining samples due to the privacy concern. Targeting to these two challenges,\nwe propose the TOpic ATtentive transformer-based ADD model, abbreviated as\nTOAT. To address the first challenge, in the TOAT model, topic is taken as the\nbasic unit of the textual and audio data according to the question-answer form\nin a typical interviewing process. Based on that, a topic attention module is\ndesigned to learn the importance of of each topic, which helps the model better\nretrieve the depressed samples. To solve the issue of data scarcity, we\nintroduce large pre-trained models, and the fine-tuning strategy is adopted\nbased on the small-scale ADD training data. We also design a two-branch\narchitecture with a late-fusion strategy for building the TOAT model, in which\nthe textual and audio data are encoded independently. We evaluate our model on\nthe multimodal DAIC-WOZ dataset specifically designed for the ADD task.\nExperimental results show the superiority of our method.

This knowledge can be used to complement and confirm\nother spatio-temporal descriptions of events, highlighting previously unseen or\nundervalued aspects.

The analyses are based on assumptions that the\nexpected or empirical average loss function is Lipschitz smooth (i.e., its\ngradient is Lipschitz continuous) and the learning rates depend on the\nLipschitz constant of the Lipschitz continuous gradient. Meanwhile, numerical\nevaluations of Adam and its variants have clarified that using small constant\nlearning rates without depending on the Lipschitz constant and hyperparameters\n($\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$) close to one is advantageous for training deep neural\nnetworks. Since computing the Lipschitz constant is NP-hard, the Lipschitz\nsmoothness condition would be unrealistic. This paper provides theoretical\nanalyses of Adam without assuming the Lipschitz smoothness condition in order\nto bridge the gap between theory and practice. The main contribution is to show\ntheoretical evidence that Adam using small learning rates and hyperparameters\nclose to one performs well, whereas the previous theoretical results were all\nfor hyperparameters close to zero.

Finally, we fuse these two vector\nrepresentations via the fusion layer and generate the code comment through the\ndecoder. To show the competitiveness of our proposed method, we construct a\nhigh-quality corpus by combining the corpus shared in the previous NL2Bash\nstudy and the corpus shared in the NLC2CMD competition. This corpus contains\n10,592 Bash codes and corresponding comments. Then we selected ten baselines\nfrom previous studies on automatic code comment generation, which cover\ninformation retrieval methods, deep learning methods, and hybrid methods.",

Multi-Objective Bayesian\nOptimisation (MOBO) is a very efficient tool for tackling expensive black-box\nproblems. However, most MOBO algorithms are designed as purely sequential\nstrategies, and existing batch approaches are prohibitively expensive for all\nbut the smallest of batch sizes.

Our extensive\nexperimental validation demonstrates that HIPPO is at least as efficient as\nexisting alternatives whilst incurring an order of magnitude lower\ncomputational overhead and scaling easily to batch sizes considerably higher\nthan currently supported in the literature. Additionally, we demonstrate the\napplication of HIPPO to a challenging heat exchanger design problem, stressing\nthe real-world utility of our highly parallelisable approach to MOBO.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning recently proved efficient in learning differential equations\nand dynamical systems from data. However, the data is commonly assumed to\noriginate from a single never-changing system. In contrast, when modeling\nreal-world dynamical processes, the data distribution often shifts due to\nchanges in the underlying system dynamics. Continual learning of these\nprocesses aims to rapidly adapt to abrupt system changes without forgetting\nprevious dynamical regimes. This work proposes an approach to continual\nlearning based on reservoir computing, a state-of-the-art method for training\nrecurrent neural networks on complex spatiotemporal dynamical systems.\nReservoir computing fixes the recurrent network weights - hence these cannot be\nforgotten - and only updates linear projection heads to the output. We propose\nto train multiple competitive prediction heads concurrently. Inspired by\nneuroscience's predictive coding, only the most predictive heads activate,\nlaterally inhibiting and thus protecting the inactive heads from forgetting\ninduced by interfering parameter updates. We show that this multi-head\nreservoir minimizes interference and catastrophic forgetting on several\ndynamical systems, including the Van-der-Pol oscillator, the chaotic Lorenz\nattractor, and the high-dimensional Lorenz-96 weather model. Our results\nsuggest that reservoir computing is a promising candidate framework for the\ncontinual learning of dynamical systems.

Combined with the advancement of\nArtificial Intelligence and simulation, such groups can be simulated, and\nsafety-critical models can be learned controlling the cars within. This study\napplies reinforcement learning to the problem of multi-agent car parking, where\ngroups of cars aim to efficiently park themselves, while remaining safe and\nrational. Utilising robust tools and machine learning frameworks, we design and\nimplement a flexible car parking environment in the form of a Markov decision\nprocess with independent learners, exploiting multi-agent communication. We\nimplement a suite of tools to perform experiments at scale, obtaining models\nparking up to 7 cars with over a 98.1% success rate, significantly beating\nexisting single-agent models. We also obtain several results relating to\ncompetitive and collaborative behaviours exhibited by the cars in our\nenvironment, with varying densities and levels of communication. Notably, we\ndiscover a form of collaboration that cannot arise without competition, and a\n'leaky' form of collaboration whereby agents collaborate without sufficient\nstate.

It is unsure whether out-of-distribution detection models reliant\non deep neural networks are suitable for detecting domain shifts in medical\nimaging. Gaussian Processes can reliably separate in-distribution data points\nfrom out-of-distribution data points via their mathematical construction.\nHence, we propose a parameter efficient Bayesian layer for hierarchical\nconvolutional Gaussian Processes that incorporates Gaussian Processes operating\nin Wasserstein-2 space to reliably propagate uncertainty. This directly\nreplaces convolving Gaussian Processes with a distance-preserving affine\noperator on distributions. Our experiments on brain tissue-segmentation show\nthat the resulting architecture approaches the performance of well-established\ndeterministic segmentation algorithms (U-Net), which has not been achieved with\nprevious hierarchical Gaussian Processes. Moreover, by applying the same\nsegmentation model to out-of-distribution data (i.e., images with pathology\nsuch as brain tumors), we show that our uncertainty estimates result in\nout-of-distribution detection that outperforms the capabilities of previous\nBayesian networks and reconstruction-based approaches that learn normative\ndistributions.

    "abstract": "The self-alignment process can provide an accurate initial attitude of SINS.\nThe conventional two-procedure method usually includes coarse and fine\nalignment processes. Coarse alignment is usually based on the OBA\n(optimization-based alignment) method, batch estimates the constant initial\nattitude at the beginning of self-alignment. OBA converges rapidly, however,\nthe accuracy is low because the method doesn't consider IMU's bias errors. The\nfine alignment applies a recursive Bayesian filter which makes the system error\nestimation of the IMU more accurate, but at the same time, the attitude error\nconverges slowly with a large heading misalignment angle. Researchers have\nproposed the unified self-alignment to achieve self-alignment in one procedure,\nbut when the misalignment angle is large, the existing methods based on\nrecursive Bayesian filter are still slow to converge. In this paper, a unified\nmethod based on batch estimator FGO (factor graph optimization) is raised. To\nthe best as the author known, this is the first batch method capable of\nestimating all the systematic errors of IMU and the constant initial attitude\nsimultaneously, with fast convergence and high accuracy.

Firstly, the AI system needs to follow guidelines or well-defined\nprocesses set by experts; the data alone will not be adequate.

Likewise, a\nnutritionist's knowledge and steps would need to be used for an AI system that\nguides a diabetic patient in developing a food plan. Second, the BlackBox\nnature typical of many current AI systems will not work; the user of an AI\nsystem will need to be able to give user-understandable explanations,\nexplanations constructed using concepts that humans can understand and are\nfamiliar with. This is the key to eliciting confidence and trust in the AI\nsystem.

    "abstract": "This report examines what I see as the core argument for concern about\nexistential risk from misaligned artificial intelligence. I proceed in two\nstages. First, I lay out a backdrop picture that informs such concern. On this\npicture, intelligent agency is an extremely powerful force, and creating agents\nmuch more intelligent than us is playing with fire -- especially given that if\ntheir objectives are problematic, such agents would plausibly have instrumental\nincentives to seek power over humans. Second, I formulate and evaluate a more\nspecific six-premise argument that creating agents of this kind will lead to\nexistential catastrophe by 2070. On this argument, by 2070: (1) it will become\npossible and financially feasible to build relevantly powerful and agentic AI\nsystems; (2) there will be strong incentives to do so; (3) it will be much\nharder to build aligned (and relevantly powerful/agentic) AI systems than to\nbuild misaligned (and relevantly powerful/agentic) AI systems that are still\nsuperficially attractive to deploy; (4) some such misaligned systems will seek\npower over humans in high-impact ways; (5) this problem will scale to the full\ndisempowerment of humanity; and (6) such disempowerment will constitute an\nexistential catastrophe. I assign rough subjective credences to the premises in\nthis argument, and I end up with an overall estimate of ~5% that an existential\ncatastrophe of this kind will occur by 2070.

    "abstract": "With the rise of attacks on online accounts in the past years, more and more\nservices offer two-factor authentication for their users. Having factors out of\ntwo of the three categories something you know, something you have and\nsomething you are should ensure that an attacker cannot compromise two of them\nat once. Thus, an adversary should not be able to maliciously interact with\none's account. However, this is only true if one considers a weak adversary. In\nparticular, since most current solutions only authenticate a session and not\nindividual transactions, they are noneffective if one's device is infected with\nmalware. For online banking, the banking industry has long since identified the\nneed for authenticating transactions. However, specifications of such\nauthentication schemes are not public and implementation details vary wildly\nfrom bank to bank with most still being unable to protect against malware. In\nthis work, we present a generic approach to tackle the problem of malicious\naccount takeovers, even in the presence of malware. To this end, we define a\nnew paradigm to improve two-factor authentication that involves the concepts of\none-out-of-two security and transaction authentication. Web authentication\nschemes following this paradigm can protect security-critical transactions\nagainst manipulation, even if one of the factors is completely compromised.\nAnalyzing existing authentication schemes, we find that they do not realize\none-out-of-two security. We give a blueprint of how to design secure web\nauthentication schemes in general. Based on this blueprint we propose FIDO2\nWith Two Displays (FIDO2D), a new web authentication scheme based on the FIDO2\nstandard and prove its security using Tamarin. We hope that our work inspires a\nnew wave of more secure web authentication schemes, which protect\nsecurity-critical transactions even against attacks with malware.",

However, co-optimizing leads to different challenges:\nHow do you optimize a controller for a body that often changes its number of\ninputs and outputs?

In this article, we study the effects of centralized\nand decentralized controllers on modular robot performance and morphologies.\nThis is done by implementing one centralized and two decentralized continuous\ntime recurrent neural network controllers, as well as a sine wave controller\nfor a baseline. We found that a decentralized approach that was more\nindependent of morphology size performed significantly better than the other\napproaches. It also worked well in a larger variety of morphology sizes. In\naddition, we highlighted the difficulties of implementing centralized control\nfor a changing morphology, and saw that our centralized controller struggled\nmore with early convergence than the other approaches. Our findings indicate\nthat duplicated decentralized networks are beneficial when evolving both the\nmorphology and control of modular robots. Overall, if these findings translate\nto other robot systems, our results and issues encountered can help future\nresearchers make a choice of control method when co-optimizing morphology and\ncontrol.",

In describing system behavior, actions and states\nare two of the most commonly used concepts. In this paper, we focus on the\nnotion of action. It generally held that the meaning of the concept of action\nis not that easy to grasp. According to some researchers, many existing systems\ndo involve the notion of action, but in an obscure way. In Unified Modeling\nLanguage (UML), an action is a single atomic step within an activity, i.e., it\nis not further decomposed within the activity. Activity represents a behavior\nthat is composed of actions. This paper contributes to the establishment of a\nbroader interdisciplinary understanding of the notion of action in conceptual\nmodeling based on a model called the thinging machine (TM). The TM uses only\nfive primitive actions: create, process, release, transfer, and receive. The\ngoal of such a venture is to improve the process of developing conceptual\nmodels by refining basic concepts such as action and event. To demonstrate how\nTM modeling represents actions, UML activity and Business Process Model and\nNotation (BPMN) diagrams are re-modeled in terms of the five TM actions. The\nresults reveal the viability of the TM s five actions in modeling and relate\nthem to other important notions such as activity, event, and behavior.",

This\nusually skimmed-over trick is actually critical for SSL methods to display\ncompetitive performances. For example, on ImageNet classification, more than 30\npoints of percentage can be gained that way. This is a little vexing, as one\nwould hope that the network layer at which invariance is explicitly enforced by\nthe SSL criterion during training (the last layer) should be the one to use for\nbest generalization performance downstream. But it seems not to be, and this\nstudy sheds some light on why. This trick, which we name Guillotine\nRegularization (GR), is in fact a generically applicable form of regularization\nthat has also been used to improve generalization performance in transfer\nlearning scenarios. In this work, through theory and experiments, we formalize\nGR and identify the underlying reasons behind its success in SSL methods. Our\nstudy shows that the use of this trick is essential to SSL performance for two\nmain reasons: (i) improper data-augmentations to define the positive pairs used\nduring training, and/or (ii) suboptimal selection of the hyper-parameters of\nthe SSL loss.",

    "abstract": "Arbitrary-shaped scene text detection is a challenging task due to the\nvariety of text changes in font, size, color, and orientation. Most existing\nregression based methods resort to regress the masks or contour points of text\nregions to model the text instances. However, regressing the complete masks\nrequires high training complexity, and contour points are not sufficient to\ncapture the details of highly curved texts. To tackle the above limitations, we\npropose a novel light-weight anchor-free text detection framework called\nTextDCT, which adopts the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to encode the text\nmasks as compact vectors. Further, considering the imbalanced number of\ntraining samples among pyramid layers, we only employ a single-level head for\ntop-down prediction. To model the multi-scale texts in a single-level head, we\nintroduce a novel positive sampling strategy by treating the shrunk text region\nas positive samples, and design a feature awareness module (FAM) for\nspatial-awareness and scale-awareness by fusing rich contextual information and\nfocusing on more significant features. Moreover, we propose a segmented\nnon-maximum suppression (S-NMS) method that can filter low-quality mask\nregressions. Extensive experiments are conducted on four challenging datasets,\nwhich demonstrate our TextDCT obtains competitive performance on both accuracy\nand efficiency. Specifically, TextDCT achieves F-measure of 85.1 at 17.2 frames\nper second (FPS) and F-measure of 84.9 at 15.1 FPS for CTW1500 and Total-Text\ndatasets, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The task of remote sensing image scene classification (RSISC), which aims at\nclassifying remote sensing images into groups of semantic categories based on\ntheir contents, has taken the important role in a wide range of applications\nsuch as urban planning, natural hazards detection, environment\nmonitoring,vegetation mapping, or geospatial object detection. During the past\nyears, research community focusing on RSISC task has shown significant effort\nto publish diverse datasets as well as propose different approaches to deal\nwith the RSISC challenges. Recently, almost proposed RSISC systems base on deep\nlearning models which prove powerful and outperform traditional approaches\nusing image processing and machine learning. In this paper, we also leverage\nthe power of deep learning technology, evaluate a variety of deep neural\nnetwork architectures, indicate main factors affecting the performance of a\nRSISC system. Given the comprehensive analysis, we propose a deep learning\nbased framework for RSISC, which makes use of the transfer learning technique\nand multihead attention scheme. The proposed deep learning framework is\nevaluated on the benchmark NWPU-RESISC45 dataset and achieves the best\nclassification accuracy of 94.7% which shows competitive to the\nstate-of-the-art systems and potential for real-life applications.",

    "abstract": "Gait-based person identification from videos captured at surveillance sites\nusing Computer Vision-based techniques is quite challenging since these walking\nsequences are usually corrupted with occlusion, and a complete cycle of gait is\nnot always available. In this work, we propose an effective neural\nnetwork-based model to reconstruct the occluded frames in an input sequence\nbefore carrying out gait recognition. Specifically, we employ LSTM networks to\npredict an embedding for each occluded frame both from the forward and the\nbackward directions, and next fuse the predictions from the two LSTMs by\nemploying a network of residual blocks and convolutional layers. While the\nLSTMs are trained to minimize the mean-squared loss, the fusion network is\ntrained to optimize the pixel-wise cross-entropy loss between the ground-truth\nand the reconstructed samples. Evaluation of our approach has been done using\nsynthetically occluded sequences generated from the OU-ISIR LP and CASIA-B data\nand real-occluded sequences present in the TUM-IITKGP data. The effectiveness\nof the proposed reconstruction model has been verified through the Dice score\nand gait-based recognition accuracy using some popular gait recognition\nmethods. Comparative study with existing occlusion handling methods in gait\nrecognition highlights the superiority of our proposed occlusion reconstruction\napproach over the others.",

    "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that deep neural networks outperform traditional\nmachine learning. However, deep networks lack generalisability, that is, they\nwill not perform as good as in a new (testing) set drawn from a different\ndistribution due to the domain shift. In order to tackle this known issue,\nseveral transfer learning approaches have been proposed, where the knowledge of\na trained model is transferred into another to improve performance with\ndifferent data. However, most of these approaches require additional training\nsteps, or they suffer from catastrophic forgetting that occurs when a trained\nmodel has overwritten previously learnt knowledge. We address both problems\nwith a novel transfer learning approach that uses network aggregation. We train\ndataset-specific networks together with an aggregation network in a unified\nframework. The loss function includes two main components: a task-specific loss\n(such as cross-entropy) and an aggregation loss. The proposed aggregation loss\nallows our model to learn how trained deep network parameters can be aggregated\nwith an aggregation operator. We demonstrate that the proposed approach learns\nmodel aggregation at test time without any further training step, reducing the\nburden of transfer learning to a simple arithmetical operation. The proposed\napproach achieves comparable performance w.r.t. the baseline. Besides, if the\naggregation operator has an inverse, we will show that our model also\ninherently allows for selective forgetting, i.e., the aggregated model can\nforget one of the datasets it was trained on, retaining information on the\nothers.",

Methods for assessing classifier\nrobustness are therefore essential. In this work, we address the challenge of\nevaluating corruption robustness in a way that allows comparability and\ninterpretability on a given dataset. We propose a test data augmentation method\nthat uses a robustness distance $\\epsilon$ derived from the datasets minimal\nclass separation distance. The resulting MSCR (mean statistical corruption\nrobustness) metric allows a dataset-specific comparison of different\nclassifiers with respect to their corruption robustness. The MSCR value is\ninterpretable, as it represents the classifiers avoidable loss of accuracy due\nto statistical corruptions. On 2D and image data, we show that the metric\nreflects different levels of classifier robustness. Furthermore, we observe\nunexpected optima in classifiers robust accuracy through training and testing\nclassifiers with different levels of noise. While researchers have frequently\nreported on a significant tradeoff on accuracy when training robust models, we\nstrengthen the view that a tradeoff between accuracy and corruption robustness\nis not inherent.

To guide the model toward better explanations, techniques in\nexplanation supervision - which add supervision signals on the model\nexplanation - have started to show promising effects on improving both the\ngeneralizability as and intrinsic interpretability of Deep Neural Networks.\nHowever, the research on supervising explanations, especially in vision-based\napplications represented through saliency maps, is in its early stage due to\nseveral inherent challenges: 1) inaccuracy of the human explanation annotation\nboundary, 2) incompleteness of the human explanation annotation region, and 3)\ninconsistency of the data distribution between human annotation and model\nexplanation maps. To address the challenges, we propose a generic RES framework\nfor guiding visual explanation by developing a novel objective that handles\ninaccurate boundary, incomplete region, and inconsistent distribution of human\nannotations, with a theoretical justification on model generalizability.\nExtensive experiments on two real-world image datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed framework on enhancing both the reasonability of\nthe explanation and the performance of the backbone DNNs model.",

    "abstract": "Gait plan is a procedure that is typically applied on the ground robots,\ne.g., quadrupedal robots; the tilt-rotor, a novel type of quadrotor with eight\ninputs, is not one of them. While controlling the tilt-rotor relying on\nfeedback linearization, the tilting angles (inputs) are expected to change\nover-intensively, which may not be expected in the application. To help\nsuppress the intensive change in the tilting angles, a gait plan procedure is\nintroduced to the tilt-rotor before feedback linearization. The tilting angles\nare specified with time in advance by users rather than given by the control\nrule. However, based on this scenario, the decoupling matrix in feedback\nlinearization can be singular for some attitudes, combinations of roll angle\nand pitch angle. It hinders the further application of the feedback\nlinearization. With this concern, Two Color Map Theorem is established to\nmaximize the acceptable attitude region, where the combinations of roll and\npitch will give an invertible decoupling matrix. That theorem, however,\nover-restricts the choice of the tilting angles, which can rule out some\nfeasible robust gaits. This paper gives the generalized Two Color Map Theorem;\nall the robust gaits can be found based on this generalized theorem.

In AUV navigation, Doppler\nvelocity log (DVL) is mainly used to aid the INS, while for UAVs, it is common\nto use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) receivers. The fusion between\nthe aiding sensor and the INS requires a definition of step size parameter in\nthe estimation process. It is responsible for the solution frequency update\nand, eventually, its accuracy. The choice of the step size poses a tradeoff\nbetween computational load and navigation performance. Generally, the aiding\nsensors update frequency is considered much slower compared to the INS\noperating frequency (hundreds Hertz). Such high rate is unnecessary for most\nplatforms, specifically for low dynamics AUVs. In this work, a supervised\nmachine learning based adaptive tuning scheme to select the proper INS step\nsize is proposed. To that end, a velocity error bound is defined, allowing the\nINS/DVL or the INS/GNSS to act in a sub-optimal working conditions, and yet\nminimize the computational load. Results from simulations and field experiment\nshow the benefits of using the proposed approach. In addition, the proposed\nframework can be applied to any other fusion scenarios between any type of\nsensors or platforms.",

    "abstract": "Given the democratic nature of open source development, code review and issue\ndiscussions may be uncivil. Incivility, defined as features of discussion that\nconvey an unnecessarily disrespectful tone, can have negative consequences to\nopen source communities. To prevent or minimize these negative consequences,\nopen source platforms have included mechanisms for removing uncivil language\nfrom the discussions. However, such approaches require manual inspection, which\ncan be overwhelming given the large number of discussions. To help open source\ncommunities deal with this problem, in this paper, we aim to compare six\nclassical machine learning models with BERT to detect incivility in open source\ncode review and issue discussions. Furthermore, we assess if adding contextual\ninformation improves the models' performance and how well the models perform in\na cross-platform setting. We found that BERT performs better than classical\nmachine learning models, with a best F1-score of 0.95. Furthermore, classical\nmachine learning models tend to underperform to detect non-technical and civil\ndiscussions. Our results show that adding the contextual information to BERT\ndid not improve its performance and that none of the analyzed classifiers had\nan outstanding performance in a cross-platform setting.

However, the insightful connections between them have\nrarely been studied. In this study, a generalized probabilistic monitoring\nmodel (GPMM) is developed with both random and sequential data. Since GPMM can\nbe reduced to various probabilistic linear models under specific restrictions,\nit is adopted to analyze the connections between different monitoring methods.\nUsing expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, the parameters of GPMM are\nestimated for both random and sequential cases. Based on the obtained model\nparameters, statistics are designed for monitoring different aspects of the\nprocess system. Besides, the distributions of these statistics are rigorously\nderived and proved, so that the control limits can be calculated accordingly.\nAfter that, contribution analysis methods are presented for identifying faulty\nvariables once the process anomalies are detected. Finally, the equivalence\nbetween monitoring models based on classical multivariate methods and their\ncorresponding probabilistic graphic models is further investigated. The\nconclusions of this study are verified using a numerical example and the\nTennessee Eastman (TE) process.

We consider biologically plausible supervised-\nand reinforcement-learning rules and ask whether changes in network activity\nduring learning can be used to determine which learning rule is being used.\nSupervised learning requires a credit-assignment model estimating the mapping\nfrom neural activity to behavior, and, in a biological organism, this model\nwill inevitably be an imperfect approximation of the ideal mapping, leading to\na bias in the direction of the weight updates relative to the true gradient.\nReinforcement learning, on the other hand, requires no credit-assignment model\nand tends to make weight updates following the true gradient direction.

In most cases, we are only given imperfect simulators with\nsimplified dynamics, which inevitably lead to severe sim-to-real gaps in RL\npolicy learning. The recently emerged field of offline RL provides another\npossibility to learn policies directly from pre-collected historical data.\nHowever, to achieve reasonable performance, existing offline RL algorithms need\nimpractically large offline data with sufficient state-action space coverage\nfor training. This brings up a new question: is it possible to combine learning\nfrom limited real data in offline RL and unrestricted exploration through\nimperfect simulators in online RL to address the drawbacks of both approaches?\nIn this study, we propose the Dynamics-Aware Hybrid Offline-and-Online\nReinforcement Learning (H2O) framework to provide an affirmative answer to this\nquestion. H2O introduces a dynamics-aware policy evaluation scheme, which\nadaptively penalizes the Q function learning on simulated state-action pairs\nwith large dynamics gaps, while also simultaneously allowing learning from a\nfixed real-world dataset. Through extensive simulation and real-world tasks, as\nwell as theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the superior performance of H2O\nagainst other cross-domain online and offline RL algorithms.

    "abstract": "Brain graph representation learning serves as the fundamental technique for\nbrain diseases diagnosis. Great efforts from both the academic and industrial\ncommunities have been devoted to brain graph representation learning in recent\nyears. The isomorphic neural network (IsoNN) introduced recently can\nautomatically learn the existence of sub-graph patterns in brain graphs, which\nis also the state-of-the-art brain graph representation learning method by this\ncontext so far. However, IsoNN fails to capture the orientations of sub-graph\npatterns, which may render the learned representations to be useless for many\ncases. In this paper, we propose a new Iso-CapsNet (Isomorphic Capsule Net)\nmodel by introducing the graph isomorphic capsules for effective brain graph\nrepresentation learning. Based on the capsule dynamic routing, besides the\nsubgraph pattern existence confidence scores, Iso-CapsNet can also learn other\nsub-graph rich properties, including position, size and orientation, for\ncalculating the class-wise digit capsules. We have compared Iso-CapsNet with\nboth classic and state-of-the-art brain graph representation approaches with\nextensive experiments on four brain graph benchmark datasets. The experimental\nresults also demonstrate the effectiveness of Iso-CapsNet, which can\nout-perform the baseline methods with significant improvements.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic events are sounds with well-defined spectro-temporal characteristics\nwhich can be associated with the physical objects generating them. Acoustic\nscenes are collections of such acoustic events in no specific temporal order.\nGiven this natural linkage between events and scenes, a common belief is that\nthe ability to classify events must help in the classification of scenes. This\nhas led to several efforts attempting to do well on Acoustic Event Tagging\n(AET) and Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) using a multi-task network.\nHowever, in these efforts, improvement in one task does not guarantee an\nimprovement in the other, suggesting a tension between ASC and AET. It is\nunclear if improvements in AET translates to improvements in ASC. We explore\nthis conundrum through an extensive empirical study and show that under certain\nconditions, using AET as an auxiliary task in the multi-task network\nconsistently improves ASC performance. Additionally, ASC performance further\nimproves with the AET data-set size and is not sensitive to the choice of\nevents or the number of events in the AET data-set. We conclude that this\nimprovement in ASC performance comes from the regularization effect of using\nAET and not from the network's improved ability to discern between acoustic\nevents.",

In fully observable environments, most\nreward functions have an optimal policy which seeks power by keeping options\nopen and staying alive. However, the real world is neither fully observable,\nnor will agents be perfectly optimal. We consider a range of models of AI\ndecision-making, from optimal, to random, to choices informed by learning and\ninteracting with an environment. We discover that many decision-making\nfunctions are retargetable, and that retargetability is sufficient to cause\npower-seeking tendencies. Our functional criterion is simple and broad. We show\nthat a range of qualitatively dissimilar decision-making procedures incentivize\nagents to seek power. We demonstrate the flexibility of our results by\nreasoning about learned policy incentives in Montezuma's Revenge.

    "abstract": "We generalize the monotone local search approach of Fomin, Gaspers,\nLokshtanov and Saurabh [J.ACM 2019], by establishing a connection between\nparameterized approximation and exponential-time approximation algorithms for\nmonotone subset minimization problems. In a monotone subset minimization\nproblem the input implicitly describes a non-empty set family over a universe\nof size $n$ which is closed under taking supersets. The task is to find a\nminimum cardinality set in this family. Broadly speaking, we use approximate\nmonotone local search to show that a parameterized $\\alpha$-approximation\nalgorithm that runs in $c^k \\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time, where $k$ is the solution\nsize, can be used to derive an $\\alpha$-approximation randomized algorithm that\nruns in $d^n \\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time, where $d$ is the unique value in $d \\in\n(1,1+\\frac{c-1}{\\alpha})$ such that\n$\\mathcal{D}(\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\|\\frac{d-1}{c-1})=\\frac{\\ln c}{\\alpha}$ and\n$\\mathcal{D}(a \\|b)$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This running time\nmatches that of Fomin et al. for $\\alpha=1$, and is strictly better when\n$\\alpha >1$, for any $c > 1$. Furthermore, we also show that this result can be\nderandomized at the expense of a sub-exponential multiplicative factor in the\nrunning time.\nWe demonstrate the potential of approximate monotone local search by deriving\nnew and faster exponential approximation algorithms for Vertex Cover,\n$3$-Hitting Set, Directed Feedback Vertex Set, Directed Subset Feedback Vertex\nSet, Directed Odd Cycle Transversal and Undirected Multicut. For instance, we\nget a $1.1$-approximation algorithm for Vertex Cover with running time $1.114^n\n\\cdot n^{O(1)}$, improving upon the previously best known $1.1$-approximation\nrunning in time $1.127^n \\cdot n^{O(1)}$ by Bourgeois et al.

    "abstract": "Digital recommender systems such as Spotify and Netflix affect not only\nconsumer behavior but also producer incentives: producers seek to supply\ncontent that will be recommended by the system. But what content will be\nproduced? In this paper, we investigate the supply-side equilibria in content\nrecommender systems. We model users and content as $D$-dimensional vectors, and\nrecommend the content that has the highest dot product with each user. The main\nfeatures of our model are that the producer decision space is high-dimensional\nand the user base is heterogeneous. This gives rise to new qualitative\nphenomena at equilibrium: First, the formation of genres, where producers\nspecialize to compete for subsets of users. Using a duality argument, we derive\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for this specialization to occur. Second,\nwe show that producers can achieve positive profit at equilibrium, which is\ntypically impossible under perfect competition. We derive sufficient conditions\nfor this to occur, and show it is closely connected to specialization of\ncontent. In both results, the interplay between the geometry of the users and\nthe structure of producer costs influences the structure of the supply-side\nequilibria.

We initiate the study of a quantum analogue of NPSPACE, denoted\nStreaming-QCMASPACE (SQCMASPACE), where an exponentially long classical proof\nis streamed to a poly-space quantum verifier. Besides two main results, we also\nshow that a quantum analogue of Savitch's theorem is unlikely to hold, as\nSQCMASPACE=NEXP. For completeness, we introduce Streaming-QMASPACE (SQMASPACE)\nwith an exponentially long streamed quantum proof, and show SQMASPACE=QMA_EXP\n(quantum analogue of NEXP). Our first main result shows, in contrast to the\nclassical setting, the solution space of a quantum constraint satisfaction\nproblem (i.e. a local Hamiltonian) is always connected when exponentially long\nproofs are permitted. For this, we show how to simulate any Lipschitz\ncontinuous path on the unit hypersphere via a sequence of local unitary gates,\nat the expense of blowing up the circuit size. This shows quantum\nerror-correcting codes can be unable to detect one codeword erroneously\nevolving to another if the evolution happens sufficiently slowly, and answers\nan open question of [Gharibian, Sikora, ICALP 2015] regarding the Ground State\nConnectivity problem.

    "title": "Data-driven reduced order models using invariant foliations, manifolds  and autoencoders",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the question: how to identify a reduced order model from\ndata. There are three ways to relate data to a model: invariant foliations,\ninvariant manifolds and autoencoders. Invariant manifolds cannot be fitted to\ndata unless a hardware in a loop system is used. Autoencoders only identify the\nportion of the phase space where the data is, which is not necessarily an\ninvariant manifold. Therefore for off-line data the only option is an invariant\nfoliation. We note that Koopman eigenfunctions also define invariant\nfoliations, but they are limited by the assumption of linearity and resulting\nsingularites. Finding an invariant foliation requires approximating\nhigh-dimensional functions. We propose two solutions. If an accurate reduced\norder model is sought, a sparse polynomial approximation is used, with\npolynomial coefficients that are sparse hierarchical tensors. If an invariant\nmanifold is sought, as a leaf of a foliation, the required high-dimensional\nfunction can be approximated by a low-dimensional polynomial. The two methods\ncan be combined to find an accurate reduced order model and an invariant\nmanifold. We also analyse the reduced order model in case of a focus type\nequilibrium, typical in mechanical systems. We note that the nonlinear\ncoordinate system defined by the invariant foliation and the invariant manifold\ndistorts instantaneous frequencies and damping ratios, which we correct.\nThrough examples we illustrate the calculation of invariant foliations and\nmanifolds, and at the same time show that Koopman eigenfunctions and\nautoencoders fail to capture accurate reduced order models under the same\nconditions.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural models have shown remarkable performance in image recognition\ntasks, whenever large datasets of labeled images are available. The largest\ndatasets in radiology are available for screening mammography. Recent reports,\nincluding in high impact journals, document performance of deep models at or\nabove that of trained radiologists. What is not yet known is whether\nperformance of these trained models is robust and replicates across datasets.\nHere we evaluate performance of five published state-of-the-art models on four\npublicly available mammography datasets. The limited size of public datasets\nprecludes retraining the model and so we are limited to evaluate those models\nthat have been made available with pre-trained parameters. Where test data was\navailable, we replicated published results. However, the trained models\nperformed poorly on out-of-sample data, except when based on all four standard\nviews of a mammographic exam. We conclude that future progress will depend on a\nconcerted effort to make more diverse and larger mammography datasets publicly\navailable. Meanwhile, results that are not accompanied by a release of trained\nmodels for independent validation should be judged cautiously.",

    "abstract": "Creating large datasets of medical radiology images from several sources can\nbe challenging because of the differences in the acquisition and storage\nstandards. One possible way of controlling and/or assessing the image selection\nprocess is through medical image clustering. This, however, requires an\nefficient method for learning latent image representations. In this paper, we\ntackle the problem of fully-unsupervised clustering of medical images using\npixel data only. We test the performance of several contemporary approaches,\nbuilt on top of a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) - convolutional deep embedded\nclustering (CDEC) and convolutional improved deep embedded clustering (CIDEC) -\nand three approaches based on preset feature extraction - histogram of oriented\ngradients (HOG), local binary pattern (LBP) and principal component analysis\n(PCA). CDEC and CIDEC are end-to-end clustering solutions, involving\nsimultaneous learning of latent representations and clustering assignments,\nwhereas the remaining approaches rely on k-means clustering from fixed\nembeddings. We train the models on 30,000 images, and test them using a\nseparate test set consisting of 8,000 images. We sampled the data from the PACS\nrepository archive of the Clinical Hospital Centre Rijeka. For evaluation, we\nuse silhouette score, homogeneity score and normalised mutual information (NMI)\non two target parameters, closely associated with commonly occurring DICOM tags\n- Modality and anatomical region (adjusted BodyPartExamined tag).

Compared to the conventional speech representation MFCC, all SSL\npre-trained speech representations captured more AF information, and achieved\nbetter phoneme recognition performance within and across languages, with HuBert\nperforming best. The frame-level AF probing task is a good predictor of phoneme\nrecognition performance, showing the importance of capturing AF information in\nthe speech representations.

Through the Fetoscopic Placental\nVessel Segmentation and Registration (FetReg2021) challenge, which was\norganized as part of the MICCAI2021 Endoscopic Vision challenge, we released\nthe first largescale multicentre TTTS dataset for the development of\ngeneralized and robust semantic segmentation and video mosaicking algorithms.\nFor this challenge, we released a dataset of 2060 images, pixel-annotated for\nvessels, tool, fetus and background classes, from 18 in-vivo TTTS fetoscopy\nprocedures and 18 short video clips. Seven teams participated in this challenge\nand their model performance was assessed on an unseen test dataset of 658\npixel-annotated images from 6 fetoscopic procedures and 6 short clips.

    "abstract": "Decision makers often want to identify the individuals for whom some\nintervention or treatment will be most effective in order to decide who to\ntreat. In such cases, decision makers would ideally like to rank potential\nrecipients of the treatment according to their individual causal effects.\nHowever, the historical data available to estimate the causal effects could be\nconfounded, and as a result, accurately estimating the effects could be\nimpossible. We propose a new and less restrictive assumption about historical\ndata, called the ranking preservation assumption (RPA), under which the ranking\nof the individual effects can be consistently estimated even if the effects\nthemselves cannot be accurately estimated. Importantly, we find that\nconfounding can be helpful for the estimation of the causal-effect ranking when\nthe confounding bias is larger for individuals with larger causal effects, and\nthat even when this is not the case, any detrimental impact of confounding can\nbe corrected with larger training data when the RPA is met. We then\nanalytically show that the RPA can be met in a variety of scenarios, including\ncommon business applications such as online advertising and customer retention.\nWe support this finding with an empirical example in the context of online\nadvertising. The example also shows how to evaluate the decision making of a\nconfounded model in practice. The main takeaway is that what might\ntraditionally be considered \"good\" data for causal estimation (i.e.,\nunconfounded data) may not be necessary to make good causal decisions, so\ntreatment assignment methods may work better than we give them credit for in\nthe presence of confounding.",

However, only the beginning of life has been\nconsidered and effects such as damage accumulation have been neglected. Here, a\nmulti-physics phase field fatigue model has been developed to study crack\npropagation in battery electrode particles undergoing hundreds of cycles. In\naddition, we couple our electrochemo-mechanical formulation with X-ray CT\nimaging to simulate fatigue cracking of realistic particle microstructures.\nUsing this modelling framework, non-linear crack propagation behaviour is\npredicted, leading to the observation of an exponential increase in cracked\narea with cycle number. Three stages of crack growth (slow, accelerating and\nunstable) are observed, with phenomena such as crack initialisation at concave\nregions and crack coalescence having a significant contribution to the\nresulting fatigue crack growth rates. The critical values of C-rate, particle\nsize and initial crack length are determined, and found to be lower than those\nreported in the literature using static fracture models.

Predicting\nall DDIs is a challenging and critical problem. Most existing computational\nmodels integrate drug-centric information from different sources and leverage\nthem as features in machine learning classifiers to predict DDIs.

This paper proposes a novel Hypergraph\nNeural Network (HyGNN) model based on only the SMILES string of drugs,\navailable for any drug, for the DDI prediction problem. To capture the drug\nsimilarities, we create a hypergraph from drugs' chemical substructures\nextracted from the SMILES strings.

    "abstract": "Spoken language understanding (SLU) treats automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nand natural language understanding (NLU) as a unified task and usually suffers\nfrom data scarcity. We exploit an ASR and NLU joint training method based on\nmeta auxiliary learning to improve the performance of low-resource SLU task by\nonly taking advantage of abundant manual transcriptions of speech data. One\nobvious advantage of such method is that it provides a flexible framework to\nimplement a low-resource SLU training task without requiring access to any\nfurther semantic annotations. In particular, a NLU model is taken as label\ngeneration network to predict intent and slot tags from texts; a multi-task\nnetwork trains ASR task and SLU task synchronously from speech; and the\npredictions of label generation network are delivered to the multi-task network\nas semantic targets. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated\nwith experiments on the public CATSLU dataset, which produces more suitable ASR\nhypotheses for the downstream NLU task.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new approach, the calibrated nonparametric scan statistic\n(CNSS), for more accurate detection of anomalous patterns in large-scale,\nreal-world graphs. Scan statistics identify connected subgraphs that are\ninteresting or unexpected through maximization of a likelihood ratio statistic;\nin particular, nonparametric scan statistics (NPSSs) identify subgraphs with a\nhigher than expected proportion of individually significant nodes. However, we\nshow that recently proposed NPSS methods are miscalibrated, failing to account\nfor the maximization of the statistic over the multiplicity of subgraphs. This\nresults in both reduced detection power for subtle signals, and low precision\nof the detected subgraph even for stronger signals. Thus we develop a new\nstatistical approach to recalibrate NPSSs, correctly adjusting for multiple\nhypothesis testing and taking the underlying graph structure into account.\nWhile the recalibration, based on randomization testing, is computationally\nexpensive, we propose both an efficient (approximate) algorithm and new,\nclosed-form lower bounds (on the expected maximum proportion of significant\nnodes for subgraphs of a given size, under the null hypothesis of no anomalous\npatterns). These advances, along with the integration of recent core-tree\ndecomposition methods, enable CNSS to scale to large real-world graphs, with\nsubstantial improvement in the accuracy of detected subgraphs. Extensive\nexperiments on both semi-synthetic and real-world datasets are demonstrated to\nvalidate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, in comparison with\nstate-of-the-art counterparts.",

The decisions of DMs can be nudged or manipulated when\ntheir risk preferences are influenced by factors like the perception of losses\nand the availability of information about the uncertainties. In this work, we\npropose a Stackelberg risk preference design (STRIPE) problem to capture a\ndesigner's incentive to influence DMs' risk preferences. STRIPE consists of two\nlevels. In the lower-level, individual DMs in a population, known as the\nfollowers, respond to uncertainties according to their risk preference types\nthat specify their risk measures. In the upper-level, the leader influences the\ndistribution of the types to induce targeted decisions and steers the\nfollower's preferences to it. Our analysis centers around the solution concept\nof approximate Stackelberg equilibrium that yields suboptimal behaviors of the\nplayers. We show the existence of the approximate Stackelberg equilibrium. The\nprimitive risk perception gap, defined as the Wasserstein distance between the\noriginal and the target type distributions, is important in estimating the\noptimal design cost. We connect the leader's optimality tolerance on the cost\nwith her ambiguity tolerance on the follower's approximate solutions leveraging\nLipschitzian properties of the lower-level solution mapping. To obtain the\nStackelberg equilibrium, we reformulate STRIPE into a single-level optimization\nproblem using the spectral representations of law-invariant coherent risk\nmeasures.

In this paper, we expand this methodology and propose\nconstrained shortest-path models for challenging discrete variants of bilevel\nand robust optimization, where traditional methods (e.g., dualize-and-combine)\nare not applicable compared to their continuous counterparts. Specifically, we\npropose a framework that models problems as decision diagrams and introduces\nside constraints either as linear inequalities in the underlying polyhedral\nrepresentation, or as state variables in shortest-path calculations. We show\nthat the first case generalizes a common class of combinatorial bilevel\nproblems where the follower's decisions are separable with respect to the\nleader's decisions. In this setting, the side constraints are indicator\nfunctions associated with arc flows, and we leverage polyhedral structure to\nderive an alternative single-level reformulation of the bilevel problem. The\ncase where side constraints are incorporated as node states, in turn,\ngeneralizes classical robust optimization. For this scenario, we leverage\nnetwork structure to derive an iterative augmenting state-space strategy akin\nto an L-shaped method.

We hypothesize that deep learning\napplied to a structural neuroimaging dataset could detect disease-related\nalteration and improve classification and diagnostic accuracy. We tested this\nhypothesis using a single, widely available, and conventional T1-weighted MRI\nscan, from which we extracted the 3D whole-brain structure using standard\npost-processing methods. A deep learning model was then developed, optimized,\nand evaluated on three open datasets with T1-weighted MRI scans of patients\nwith schizophrenia. Our proposed model outperformed the benchmark model, which\nwas also trained with structural MR images using a 3D CNN architecture. Our\nmodel is capable of almost perfectly (area under the ROC curve = 0.987)\ndistinguishing schizophrenia patients from healthy controls on unseen\nstructural MRI scans. Regional analysis localized subcortical regions and\nventricles as the most predictive brain regions. Subcortical structures serve a\npivotal role in cognitive, affective, and social functions in humans, and\nstructural abnormalities of these regions have been associated with\nschizophrenia. Our finding corroborates that schizophrenia is associated with\nwidespread alterations in subcortical brain structure and the subcortical\nstructural information provides prominent features in diagnostic\nclassification.

A dedicated boundary value solver, however, is often not directly\navailable. The most natural alternative is a nudging solver, where the problem\nis repeatedly solved forward and backward in time and the respective boundary\nconditions are restored whenever one of the temporal end points is visited. In\nthis paper, we show quasi-convergence of this scheme in the sense that the\ntermination residual of the nudging iteration is as small as the asymptotic\nerror of the method itself, i.e., under appropriate assumptions exponentially\nsmall. This confirms that optimal balance in its nudging formulation is an\neffective algorithm. Further, it shows that the boundary value problem\nformulation of optimal balance is well posed up at most a residual error as\nsmall as the asymptotic error of the method itself. The key step in our proof\nis a careful two-component Gronwall inequality.",

    "abstract": "Segmentation has emerged as a fundamental field of computer vision and\nnatural language processing, which assigns a label to every pixel/feature to\nextract regions of interest from an image/text. To evaluate the performance of\nsegmentation, the Dice and IoU metrics are used to measure the degree of\noverlap between the ground truth and the predicted segmentation. In this paper,\nwe establish a theoretical foundation of segmentation with respect to the\nDice/IoU metrics, including the Bayes rule and Dice/IoU-calibration, analogous\nto classification-calibration or Fisher consistency in classification. We prove\nthat the existing thresholding-based framework with most operating losses are\nnot consistent with respect to the Dice/IoU metrics, and thus may lead to a\nsuboptimal solution. To address this pitfall, we propose a novel consistent\nranking-based framework, namely RankDice/RankIoU, inspired by plug-in rules of\nthe Bayes segmentation rule. Three numerical algorithms with GPU parallel\nexecution are developed to implement the proposed framework in large-scale and\nhigh-dimensional segmentation. We study statistical properties of the proposed\nframework. We show it is Dice-/IoU-calibrated, and its excess risk bounds and\nthe rate of convergence are also provided. The numerical effectiveness of\nRankDice/mRankDice is demonstrated in various simulated examples and\nFine-annotated CityScapes and Pascal VOC datasets with state-of-the-art deep\nlearning architectures.",

In most real-world scenarios, however, linear regression problems\nare often ill-posed or the underlying model suffers from overfitting, leading\nto erroneous or trivial solutions. This is often dealt with by adding extra\nconstraints, known as regularization. In this paper, we use the frameworks of\nblock-encoding and quantum singular value transformation to design new quantum\nalgorithms for quantum least squares with general $\\ell_2$-regularization.\nThese include regularized versions of quantum ordinary least squares, quantum\nweighted least squares, and quantum generalized least squares. Our quantum\nalgorithms substantially improve upon prior results on quantum ridge regression\n(the regularization term is proportional to the $\\ell_2$-norm of the least\nsquares solution), which is a particular case of our result.\nTo this end, we assume approximate block-encodings of the underlying matrices\nas input and use robust QSVT algorithms for various linear algebra operations.\nIn particular, we develop a variable-time quantum algorithm for matrix\ninversion using QSVT, where we use quantum eigenvalue discrimination as a\nsubroutine instead of gapped phase estimation. This ensures that fewer\nadditional qubits are required for this procedure than prior results. Owing to\nthe generality of the block-encoding framework, our algorithms can be\nimplemented on a variety of input models and can also be seen as improved and\ngeneralized versions of the standard (non-regularized) quantum least squares\nalgorithms of Chakraborty et al.

It considers two applications\nof such models in MR images: (a) detection of spinal metastases and the related\nconditions of vertebral fractures and metastatic cord compression, (b)\nradiological grading of common degenerative changes in intervertebral discs.\nOur contributions are as follows: (i) We propose a Spinal Context Transformer\n(SCT), a deep-learning architecture suited for the analysis of repeated\nanatomical structures in medical imaging such as vertebral bodies (VBs). Unlike\nprevious related methods, SCT considers all VBs as viewed in all available\nimage modalities together, making predictions for each based on context from\nthe rest of the spinal column and all available imaging modalities. (ii) We\napply the architecture to a novel and important task: detecting spinal\nmetastases and the related conditions of cord compression and vertebral\nfractures/collapse from multi-series spinal MR scans. This is done using\nannotations extracted from free-text radiological reports as opposed to bespoke\nannotation. However, the resulting model shows strong agreement with\nvertebral-level bespoke radiologist annotations on the test set.

    "abstract": "Temporal volume images with 3D+t (4D) information are often used in medical\nimaging to statistically analyze temporal dynamics or capture disease\nprogression. Although deep-learning-based generative models for natural images\nhave been extensively studied, approaches for temporal medical image generation\nsuch as 4D cardiac volume data are limited. In this work, we present a novel\ndeep learning model that generates intermediate temporal volumes between source\nand target volumes. Specifically, we propose a diffusion deformable model (DDM)\nby adapting the denoising diffusion probabilistic model that has recently been\nwidely investigated for realistic image generation. Our proposed DDM is\ncomposed of the diffusion and the deformation modules so that DDM can learn\nspatial deformation information between the source and target volumes and\nprovide a latent code for generating intermediate frames along a geodesic path.\nOnce our model is trained, the latent code estimated from the diffusion module\nis simply interpolated and fed into the deformation module, which enables DDM\nto generate temporal frames along the continuous trajectory while preserving\nthe topology of the source image. We demonstrate the proposed method with the\n4D cardiac MR image generation between the diastolic and systolic phases for\neach subject. Compared to the existing deformation methods, our DDM achieves\nhigh performance on temporal volume generation.",

    "abstract": "The key advantage of using multiple microphones for speech enhancement is\nthat spatial filtering can be used to complement the tempo-spectral processing.\nIn a traditional setting, linear spatial filtering (beamforming) and\nsingle-channel post-filtering are commonly performed separately. In contrast,\nthere is a trend towards employing deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn a joint\nspatial and tempo-spectral non-linear filter, which means that the restriction\nof a linear processing model and that of a separate processing of spatial and\ntempo-spectral information can potentially be overcome. However, the internal\nmechanisms that lead to good performance of such data-driven filters for\nmulti-channel speech enhancement are not well understood. Therefore, in this\nwork, we analyse the properties of a non-linear spatial filter realized by a\nDNN as well as its interdependency with temporal and spectral processing by\ncarefully controlling the information sources (spatial, spectral, and temporal)\navailable to the network. We confirm the superiority of a non-linear spatial\nprocessing model, which outperforms an oracle linear spatial filter in a\nchallenging speaker extraction scenario for a low number of microphones by 0.24\nPOLQA score. Our analyses reveal that in particular spectral information should\nbe processed jointly with spatial information as this increases the spatial\nselectivity of the filter. Our systematic evaluation then leads to a simple\nnetwork architecture, that outperforms state-of-the-art network architectures\non a speaker extraction task by 0.22 POLQA score and by 0.32 POLQA score on the\nCHiME3 data.",

However, existing\nmethods rely on supervised learning, imposing an additional burden to doctors\nfor collecting disease data or annotating spatial labels for network training,\nconsequently hindering their implementation. We propose a method based on a\ndeep neural network for computer-aided diagnosis called virtual multi-view\nprojection and reconstruction for unsupervised anomaly detection. Presumably,\nthis is the first method that only requires data from healthy patients for\ntraining to identify three-dimensional (3D) regions containing any anomalies.\nThe method has three key components. Unlike existing computer-aided diagnosis\ntools that use conventional CT slices as the network input, our method 1)\nimproves the recognition of 3D lung structures by virtually projecting an\nextracted 3D lung region to obtain two-dimensional (2D) images from diverse\nviews to serve as network inputs, 2) accommodates the input diversity gain for\naccurate anomaly detection, and 3) achieves 3D anomaly/disease localization\nthrough a novel 3D map restoration method using multiple 2D anomaly maps.

The developed bi-attention mechanism can match\nfunctional information to structural information efficiently and maximize the\ncapability of extracting complementary information from rs-fMRI and DTI.

To address such a problem of data and label scarcity, generative\nmodels have been developed to augment the training datasets.

However, studies have found that\nthese pre-labeling based methods can induce hallucinating artifacts, which\nmight mislead the downstream clinical tasks, while manual adjustment could be\nonerous and subjective.

    "abstract": "Neural vocoders based on the generative adversarial neural network (GAN) have\nbeen widely used due to their fast inference speed and lightweight networks\nwhile generating high-quality speech waveforms. Since the perceptually\nimportant speech components are primarily concentrated in the low-frequency\nband, most of the GAN-based neural vocoders perform multi-scale analysis that\nevaluates downsampled speech waveforms. This multi-scale analysis helps the\ngenerator improve speech intelligibility. However, in preliminary experiments,\nwe observed that the multi-scale analysis which focuses on the low-frequency\nband causes unintended artifacts, e.g., aliasing and imaging artifacts, and\nthese artifacts degrade the synthesized speech waveform quality. Therefore, in\nthis paper, we investigate the relationship between these artifacts and\nGAN-based neural vocoders and propose a GAN-based neural vocoder, called\nAvocodo, that allows the synthesis of high-fidelity speech with reduced\nartifacts. We introduce two kinds of discriminators to evaluate waveforms in\nvarious perspectives: a collaborative multi-band discriminator and a sub-band\ndiscriminator. We also utilize a pseudo quadrature mirror filter bank to obtain\ndownsampled multi-band waveforms while avoiding aliasing.

    "abstract": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is a cutting-edge volumetric\nimaging technique that allows for three-dimensional imaging of mesoscopic\nsamples with decoupled illumination and detection paths. Although the selective\nexcitation scheme of such a microscope provides intrinsic optical sectioning\nthat minimizes out-of-focus fluorescence background and sample photodamage, it\nis prone to light absorption and scattering effects, which results in uneven\nillumination and striping artifacts in the images adversely. To tackle this\nissue, in this paper, we propose a blind stripe artifact removal algorithm in\nLSFM, called DeStripe, which combines a self-supervised spatio-spectral graph\nneural network with unfolded Hessian prior. Specifically, inspired by the\ndesirable properties of Fourier transform in condensing striping information\ninto isolated values in the frequency domain, DeStripe firstly localizes the\npotentially corrupted Fourier coefficients by exploiting the structural\ndifference between unidirectional stripe artifacts and more isotropic\nforeground images. Affected Fourier coefficients can then be fed into a graph\nneural network for recovery, with a Hessian regularization unrolled to further\nensure structures in the standard image space are well preserved. Since in\nrealistic, stripe-free LSFM barely exists with a standard image acquisition\nprotocol, DeStripe is equipped with a Self2Self denoising loss term, enabling\nartifact elimination without access to stripe-free ground truth images.\nCompetitive experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of DeStripe in\nrecovering corrupted biomarkers in LSFM with both synthetic and real stripe\nartifacts.",

    "abstract": "We introduce an atlas of algebro-geometric objects associated with image\nformation in pinhole cameras. The nodes of the atlas are algebraic varieties or\ntheir vanishing ideals related to each other by projection or elimination and\nrestriction or specialization respectively. This atlas offers a unifying\nframework for the study of problems in 3D computer vision. We initiate the\nstudy of the atlas by completely characterizing a part of the atlas stemming\nfrom the triangulation problem. We conclude with several open problems and\ngeneralizations of the atlas.",

    "title": "Thermodynamics of Interpretation",
    "abstract": "Over the past few years, different types of data-driven Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) techniques have been widely adopted in various domains of\nscience for generating predictive black-box models. However, because of their\nblack-box nature, it is crucial to establish trust in these models before\naccepting them as accurate. One way of achieving this goal is through the\nimplementation of a post-hoc interpretation scheme that can put forward the\nreasons behind a black-box model prediction. In this work, we propose a\nclassical thermodynamics inspired approach for this purpose: Thermodynamically\nExplainable Representations of AI and other black-box Paradigms (TERP). TERP\nworks by constructing a linear, local surrogate model that approximates the\nbehaviour of the black-box model within a small neighborhood around the\ninstance being explained. By employing a simple forward feature selection Monte\nCarlo algorithm, TERP assigns an interpretability free energy score to all the\npossible surrogate models in order to choose an optimal interpretation.\nAdditionally, we validate TERP as a generally applicable method by successfully\ninterpreting four different classes of black-box models trained on datasets\ncoming from relevant domains, including classifying images, predicting heart\ndisease and classifying biomolecular conformations.",
