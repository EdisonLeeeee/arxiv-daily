    "abstract": "A large number of people suffer from life-threatening cardiac abnormalities,\nand electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is beneficial to determining whether an\nindividual is at risk of such abnormalities. Automatic ECG classification\nmethods, especially the deep learning based ones, have been proposed to detect\ncardiac abnormalities using ECG records, showing good potential to improve\nclinical diagnosis and help early prevention of cardiovascular diseases.\nHowever, the predictions of the known neural networks still do not\nsatisfactorily meet the needs of clinicians, and this phenomenon suggests that\nsome information used in clinical diagnosis may not be well captured and\nutilized by these methods. In this paper, we introduce some rules into\nconvolutional neural networks, which help present clinical knowledge to deep\nlearning based ECG analysis, in order to improve automated ECG diagnosis\nperformance. Specifically, we propose a Handcrafted-Rule-enhanced Neural\nNetwork (called HRNN) for ECG classification with standard 12-lead ECG input,\nwhich consists of a rule inference module and a deep learning module.\nExperiments on two large-scale public ECG datasets show that our new approach\nconsiderably outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Further, our\nproposed approach not only can improve the diagnosis performance, but also can\nassist in detecting mislabelled ECG samples.

    "abstract": "Route choice modeling, i.e., the process of estimating the likely path that\nindividuals follow during their journeys, is a fundamental task in\ntransportation planning and demand forecasting. Classical methods generally\nadopt the discrete choice model (DCM) framework with linear utility functions\nand high-level route characteristics. While several recent studies have started\nto explore the applicability of deep learning for travel choice modeling, they\nare all path-based with relatively simple model architectures and cannot take\nadvantage of detailed link-level features. Existing link-based models, while\ntheoretically promising, are generally not as scalable or flexible enough to\naccount for the destination characteristics. To address these issues, this\nstudy proposes a general deep inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework\nfor link-based route choice modeling, which is capable of incorporating\nhigh-dimensional features and capturing complex relationships. Specifically, we\nadapt an adversarial IRL model to the route choice problem for efficient\nestimation of destination-dependent reward and policy functions. Experiment\nresults based on taxi GPS data from Shanghai, China validate the improved\nperformance of the proposed model over conventional DCMs and other imitation\nlearning baselines, even for destinations unseen in the training data. We also\ndemonstrate the model interpretability using explainable AI techniques. The\nproposed methodology provides a new direction for future development of route\nchoice models.

Research indicates that there is a tradeoff between their\nmodel performance and explainability. Machine learning models with higher\nperformance are often based on more complex algorithms and therefore lack\nexplainability and vice versa. However, there is little to no empirical\nevidence of this tradeoff from an end user perspective. We aim to provide\nempirical evidence by conducting two user experiments. Using two distinct\ndatasets, we first measure the tradeoff for five common classes of machine\nlearning algorithms. Second, we address the problem of end user perceptions of\nexplainable artificial intelligence augmentations aimed at increasing the\nunderstanding of the decision logic of high-performing complex models. Our\nresults diverge from the widespread assumption of a tradeoff curve and indicate\nthat the tradeoff between model performance and explainability is much less\ngradual in the end user's perception. This is a stark contrast to assumed\ninherent model interpretability. Further, we found the tradeoff to be\nsituational for example due to data complexity.

    "title": "To What Extent Cognitive-Driven Development Improves Code Readability?",
    "abstract": "Cognitive-Driven Development (CDD) is a coding design technique that aims to\nreduce the cognitive effort that developers place in understanding a given code\nunit (e.g., a class). By following CDD design practices, it is expected that\nthe coding units to be smaller, and, thus, easier to maintain and evolve.\nHowever, it is so far unknown whether these smaller code units coded using CDD\nstandards are, indeed, easier to understand. In this work we aim to assess to\nwhat CDD improves code readability. To achieve this goal, we conducted a\ntwo-phase study. We start by inviting professional software developers to vote\n(and justify their rationale) on the most readable pair of code snippets (from\na set of 10 pairs); one of the pairs was coded using CDD practices. We received\n133 answers. In the second phase, we applied the state-of-the art readability\nmodel on the 10-pairs of CDD-guided refactorings.\nWe observed some conflicting results. On the one hand, developers perceived\nthat seven (out of 10) CDD-guided refactorings were more readable than their\ncounterparts; for two other CDD-guided refactorings, developers were undecided,\nwhile only in one of the CDD-guided refactorings, developers preferred the\noriginal code snippet. On the other hand, we noticed that only one CDD-guided\nrefactorings have better performance readability, assessed by state-of-the-art\nreadability models. Our results provide initial evidence that CDD could be an\ninteresting approach for software design.",

    "abstract": "We introduce ART, a new corpus-level autoencoding approach for training dense\nretrieval models that does not require any labeled training data. Dense\nretrieval is a central challenge for open-domain tasks, such as Open QA, where\nstate-of-the-art methods typically require large supervised datasets with\ncustom hard-negative mining and denoising of positive examples. ART, in\ncontrast, only requires access to unpaired inputs and outputs (e.g. questions\nand potential answer documents). It uses a new document-retrieval autoencoding\nscheme, where (1) an input question is used to retrieve a set of evidence\ndocuments, and (2) the documents are then used to compute the probability of\nreconstructing the original question. Training for retrieval based on question\nreconstruction enables effective unsupervised learning of both document and\nquestion encoders, which can be later incorporated into complete Open QA\nsystems without any further finetuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nART obtains state-of-the-art results on multiple QA retrieval benchmarks with\nonly generic initialization from a pre-trained language model, removing the\nneed for labeled data and task-specific losses.",

Together with an angle distance loss, we present a\nradial beam-based image canonicalization model, short BIC. Our model allows for\nmaximal continuous angle regression and canonicalizes arbitrary center-rotated\ninput images.

Critical factors hinder the performance improvement of\ncross-domain lane detection that conventional methods only focus on pixel-wise\nloss while ignoring shape and position priors of lanes. To address the issue,\nwe propose the Multi-level Domain Adaptation (MLDA) framework, a new\nperspective to handle cross-domain lane detection at three complementary\nsemantic levels of pixel, instance and category. Specifically, at pixel level,\nwe propose to apply cross-class confidence constraints in self-training to\ntackle the imbalanced confidence distribution of lane and background. At\ninstance level, we go beyond pixels to treat segmented lanes as instances and\nfacilitate discriminative features in target domain with triplet learning,\nwhich effectively rebuilds the semantic context of lanes and contributes to\nalleviating the feature confusion. At category level, we propose an adaptive\ninter-domain embedding module to utilize the position prior of lanes during\nadaptation. In two challenging datasets, ie TuSimple and CULane, our approach\nimproves lane detection performance by a large margin with gains of 8.8% on\naccuracy and 7.4% on F1-score respectively, compared with state-of-the-art\ndomain adaptation algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases remain among the top contributors to human illness and\ndeath worldwide, among which many diseases produce epidemic waves of infection.\nThe unavailability of specific drugs and ready-to-use vaccines to prevent most\nof these epidemics makes the situation worse. These force public health\nofficials, health care providers, and policymakers to rely on early warning\nsystems generated by reliable and accurate forecasts of epidemics. Accurate\nforecasts of epidemics can assist stakeholders in tailoring countermeasures,\nsuch as vaccination campaigns, staff scheduling, and resource allocation, to\nthe situation at hand, which could translate to reductions in the impact of a\ndisease. Unfortunately, most of these past epidemics (e.g., dengue, malaria,\nhepatitis, influenza, and most recent, Covid-19) exhibit nonlinear and\nnon-stationary characteristics due to their spreading fluctuations based on\nseasonal-dependent variability and the nature of these epidemics. We analyze a\nwide variety of epidemic time series datasets using a maximal overlap discrete\nwavelet transform (MODWT) based autoregressive neural network and call it\nEWNet. MODWT techniques effectively characterize non-stationary behavior and\nseasonal dependencies in the epidemic time series and improve the forecasting\nscheme of the autoregressive neural network in the proposed ensemble wavelet\nnetwork framework. From a nonlinear time series viewpoint, we explore the\nasymptotic stationarity of the proposed EWNet model to show the asymptotic\nbehavior of the associated Markov Chain. We also theoretically investigate the\neffect of learning stability and the choice of hidden neurons in the proposed\nEWNet model.

    "abstract": "ML models deployed in production often have to face unknown domain changes,\nfundamentally different from their training settings. Performance prediction\nmodels carry out the crucial task of measuring the impact of these changes on\nmodel performance. We study the generalization capabilities of various\nperformance prediction models to new domains by learning on generated synthetic\nperturbations. Empirical validation on a benchmark of ten tabular datasets\nshows that models based upon state-of-the-art shift detection metrics are not\nexpressive enough to generalize to unseen domains, while Error Predictors bring\na consistent improvement in performance prediction under shift. We additionally\npropose a natural and effortless uncertainty estimation of the predicted\naccuracy that ensures reliable use of performance predictors.

    "abstract": "We present Transformation Invariance and Covariance Contrast (TiCo) for\nself-supervised visual representation learning. Similar to other recent\nself-supervised learning methods, our method is based on maximizing the\nagreement among embeddings of different distorted versions of the same image,\nwhich pushes the encoder to produce transformation invariant representations.\nTo avoid the trivial solution where the encoder generates constant vectors, we\nregularize the covariance matrix of the embeddings from different images by\npenalizing low rank solutions. By jointly minimizing the transformation\ninvariance loss and covariance contrast loss, we get an encoder that is able to\nproduce useful representations for downstream tasks. We analyze our method and\nshow that it can be viewed as a variant of MoCo with an implicit memory bank of\nunlimited size at no extra memory cost. This makes our method perform better\nthan alternative methods when using small batch sizes. TiCo can also be seen as\na modification of Barlow Twins. By connecting the contrastive and\nredundancy-reduction methods together, TiCo gives us new insights into how\njoint embedding methods work.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen the rapid deployment of low-cost CubeSats in low-Earth\norbit, primarily for research, education, and Earth observation. The vast\nmajority of these CubeSats experience significant latency (several hours) from\nthe time an image is captured to the time it is available on the ground. This\nis primarily due to the limited availability of dedicated satellite ground\nstations that tend to be bulky to deploy and expensive to rent. This paper\nexplores using LoRa radios in the ISM band for low-latency downlink\ncommunication from CubeSats, primarily due to the availability of extensive\nground LoRa infrastructure and minimal interference to terrestrial\ncommunication. However, the limited bandwidth of LoRa precludes rich satellite\nEarth images to be sent - instead, the CubeSats can at best send short messages\n(a few hundred bytes).\nThis paper details our experience in communicating with a LoRa-enabled\nCubeSat launched by our team. We present Vista, a communication system that\nmakes software modifications to LoRa encoding onboard a CubeSat and decoding on\ncommercial LoRa ground stations to allow for satellite imagery to be\ncommunicated, as well as wide-ranging machine learning inference on these\nimages. This is achieved through a LoRa-channel-aware image encoding that is\ninformed by the structure of satellite images, the tasks performed on it, as\nwell as the Doppler variation of satellite signals. A detailed evaluation of\nVista through trace-driven emulation with traces from the LoRa-CubeSat launch\n(in 2021) shows 4.56 dB improvement in LoRa image PSNR and 1.38x improvement in\nland-use classification over those images.",

However, the infinite-dimensionality and\nnon-linearity associated with soft robots challenge modeling and closed-loop\ncontrol of soft grippers to perform grasping tasks.

Most data-driven methods rely on\nintensive model learning in simulation or offline, and as such it may be hard\nto generalize across different settings not explicitly trained upon and in\nphysical robot testing where online control is required. In this paper, we\npropose an online modeling and control algorithm that utilizes Koopman operator\ntheory to update an estimated model of the underlying dynamics at each time\nstep in real-time.

    "abstract": "In meta reinforcement learning (meta RL), an agent learns from a set of\ntraining tasks how to quickly solve a new task, drawn from the same task\ndistribution. The optimal meta RL policy, a.k.a. the Bayes-optimal behavior, is\nwell defined, and guarantees optimal reward in expectation, taken with respect\nto the task distribution. The question we explore in this work is how many\ntraining tasks are required to guarantee approximately optimal behavior with\nhigh probability. Recent work provided the first such PAC analysis for a\nmodel-free setting, where a history-dependent policy was learned from the\ntraining tasks. In this work, we propose a different approach: directly learn\nthe task distribution, using density estimation techniques, and then train a\npolicy on the learned task distribution. We show that our approach leads to\nbounds that depend on the dimension of the task distribution. In particular, in\nsettings where the task distribution lies in a low-dimensional manifold, we\nextend our analysis to use dimensionality reduction techniques and account for\nsuch structure, obtaining significantly better bounds than previous work, which\nstrictly depend on the number of states and actions. The key of our approach is\nthe regularization implied by the kernel density estimation method.

Most of the currently\nbest performing splicing detectors leverage high-frequency artifacts. However,\nafter an image underwent strong compression, most of the high frequency\nartifacts are not available anymore. In this work, we explore an alternative\napproach to splicing detection, which is potentially better suited for images\nin-the-wild, subject to strong compression and downsampling. Our proposal is to\nmodel the color formation of an image. The color formation largely depends on\nvariations at the scale of scene objects, and is hence much less dependent on\nhigh-frequency artifacts. We learn a deep metric space that is on one hand\nsensitive to illumination color and camera white-point estimation, but on the\nother hand insensitive to variations in object color. Large distances in the\nembedding space indicate that two image regions either stem from different\nscenes or different cameras. In our evaluation, we show that the proposed\nembedding space outperforms the state of the art on images that have been\nsubject to strong compression and downsampling. We confirm in two further\nexperiments the dual nature of the metric space, namely to both characterize\nthe acquisition camera and the scene illuminant color.

We focus on two types of such signals in English texts: factual\ngender information, which is a grammatical or semantic property, and gender\nbias, which is the correlation between a word and specific gender. We can\ndisentangle the model's embeddings and identify components encoding both types\nof information with probing. We aim to diminish the stereotypical bias in the\nrepresentations while preserving the factual gender signal. Our filtering\nmethod shows that it is possible to decrease the bias of gender-neutral\nprofession names without significant deterioration of language modeling\ncapabilities. The findings can be applied to language generation to mitigate\nreliance on stereotypes while preserving gender agreement in coreferences.",

    "title": "Derivate Informed Neural Operator: An Efficient Framework for  High-Dimensional Parametric Derivative Learning",
    "abstract": "Neural operators have gained significant attention recently due to their\nability to approximate high-dimensional parametric maps between function\nspaces. At present, only parametric function approximation has been addressed\nin the neural operator literature. In this work we investigate incorporating\nparametric derivative information in neural operator training; this information\ncan improve function approximations, additionally it can be used to improve the\napproximation of the derivative with respect to the parameter, which is often\nthe key to scalable solution of high-dimensional outer-loop problems (e.g.\nBayesian inverse problems). Parametric Jacobian information is formally\nintractable to incorporate due to its high-dimensionality, to address this\nconcern we propose strategies based on reduced SVD, randomized sketching and\nthe use of reduced basis surrogates. All of these strategies only require only\n$O(r)$ Jacobian actions to construct sample Jacobian data, and allow us to\nreduce the linear algebra and memory costs associated with the Jacobian\ntraining from the product of the input and output dimensions down to $O(r^2)$,\nwhere $r$ is the dimensionality associated with the dimension reduction\ntechnique.\nNumerical results for parametric PDE problems demonstrate that the addition\nof derivative information to the training problem can significantly improve the\nparametric map approximation, particularly given few data. When Jacobian\nactions are inexpensive compared to the parametric map, this information can be\neconomically substituted for parametric map data. Additionally we show that\nJacobian error approximations improve significantly with the introduction of\nJacobian training data. This result opens the door to the use of derivative\ninformed neural operators (DINOs) in outer-loop algorithms where they can\namortize the additional training data cost via repeated evaluations.",

We show theoretically that this heuristic induces trajectories that mimic\ntransitions from diverse low-fidelity (exploration) to high-fidelity\n(exploitation) samples. Further, we introduce mechanisms to control the rate at\nwhich a trajectory transitions from exploration to exploitation, and use it to\ngeneralize outside the offline data at test-time.

    "title": "Global Planning for Contact-Rich Manipulation via Local Smoothing of  Quasi-dynamic Contact Models",
    "abstract": "The empirical success of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the setting of\ncontact-rich manipulation leaves much to be understood from a model-based\nperspective, where the key difficulties are often attributed to (i) the\nexplosion of contact modes, (ii) stiff, non-smooth contact dynamics and the\nresulting exploding / discontinuous gradients, and (iii) the non-convexity of\nthe planning problem. The stochastic nature of RL addresses (i) and (ii) by\neffectively sampling and averaging the contact modes. On the other hand,\nmodel-based methods have tackled the same challenges by smoothing contact\ndynamics analytically. Our first contribution is to establish the theoretical\nequivalence of the two methods for simple systems, and provide qualitative and\nempirical equivalence on a number of complex examples. In order to further\nalleviate (ii), our second contribution is a convex, differentiable and\nquasi-dynamic formulation of contact dynamics, which is amenable to both\nsmoothing schemes, and has proven through experiments to be highly effective\nfor contact-rich planning. Our final contribution resolves (iii), where we show\nthat classical sampling-based motion planning algorithms can be effective in\nglobal planning when contact modes are abstracted via smoothing. Applying our\nmethod on a collection of challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks, we\ndemonstrate that efficient model-based motion planning can achieve results\ncomparable to RL with dramatically less computation.

    "title": "Scaling Autoregressive Models for Content-Rich Text-to-Image Generation",
    "abstract": "We present the Pathways Autoregressive Text-to-Image (Parti) model, which\ngenerates high-fidelity photorealistic images and supports content-rich\nsynthesis involving complex compositions and world knowledge. Parti treats\ntext-to-image generation as a sequence-to-sequence modeling problem, akin to\nmachine translation, with sequences of image tokens as the target outputs\nrather than text tokens in another language. This strategy can naturally tap\ninto the rich body of prior work on large language models, which have seen\ncontinued advances in capabilities and performance through scaling data and\nmodel sizes. Our approach is simple: First, Parti uses a Transformer-based\nimage tokenizer, ViT-VQGAN, to encode images as sequences of discrete tokens.\nSecond, we achieve consistent quality improvements by scaling the\nencoder-decoder Transformer model up to 20B parameters, with a new\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot FID score of 7.23 and finetuned FID score of 3.22 on\nMS-COCO. Our detailed analysis on Localized Narratives as well as PartiPrompts\n(P2), a new holistic benchmark of over 1600 English prompts, demonstrate the\neffectiveness of Parti across a wide variety of categories and difficulty\naspects. We also explore and highlight limitations of our models in order to\ndefine and exemplify key areas of focus for further improvements.

    "abstract": "Distributed, small-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are being installed\nat a rapidly increasing rate. This can cause major impacts on distribution\nnetworks and energy markets. As a result, there is a significant need for\nimproved forecasting of the power generation of these systems at different time\nresolutions and horizons. However, the performance of forecasting models\ndepends on the resolution and horizon. Forecast combinations (ensembles), that\ncombine the forecasts of multiple models into a single forecast may be robust\nin such cases. Therefore, in this paper, we provide comparisons and insights\ninto the performance of five state-of-the-art forecast models and existing\nforecast combinations at multiple resolutions and horizons. We propose a\nforecast combination approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that\nwill enable a forecaster to produce accurate forecasts for the task at hand by\nweighting the forecasts produced by individual models. Furthermore, we compare\nthe performance of the proposed combination approach with existing forecast\ncombination approaches. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using a\nreal-world residential PV power data set measured at 25 houses located in three\nlocations in the United States. The results across four different resolutions\nand four different horizons show that the PSO-based forecast combination\napproach outperforms the use of any individual forecast model and other\nforecast combination counterparts, with an average Mean Absolute Scaled Error\nreduction by 3.81% compared to the best performing individual model. Our\napproach enables a solar forecaster to produce accurate forecasts for their\napplication regardless of the forecast resolution or horizon.",

    "title": "Sensor Observability Index: Evaluating Sensor Alignment for Task-Space  Observability in Robotic Manipulators",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a preliminary definition and analysis of the novel\nconcepts of sensor observability, sensor manipulability, and their respective\nindices. The goal is to analyse and evaluate the performance of distributed\ndirectional or axial-based sensors to observe specific axes in task space as a\nfunction of joint configuration in serial robot manipulators. For example,\njoint torque sensors are often used in serial robot manipulators and assumed to\nbe perfectly capable of estimating end effector forces, but certain joint\nconfigurations may cause one or more task-space axes to be unobservable as a\nresult of how the joint torque sensors are aligned. The proposed sensor\nobservability provides a method to analyse the quality of the current robot\nconfiguration to observe the task space. Sensor manipulability, on the other\nhand, measures the robot's ability to increase or decrease that observational\nquality, analogous to end effector positional manoeuvrability as measured by\nthe traditional kinematic manipulability. Parallels are drawn between sensor\nobservability and the traditional kinematic Jacobian for the particular case of\njoint torque sensors in serial robot manipulators. Although similar information\ncan be retrieved from kinematic analysis of the Jacobian transpose in serial\nmanipulators, sensor observability is shown to be more generalizable in terms\nof analysing non-joint-mounted sensors and other sensor types. In addition,\nnull-space analysis of the Jacobian transpose is susceptible to false\nobservability singularities. Simulations and experiments using the robot Baxter\ndemonstrate the importance of maintaining proper sensor observability in\nphysical interactions.",

    "abstract": "Cancer subtyping is crucial for understanding the nature of tumors and\nproviding suitable therapy. However, existing labelling methods are medically\ncontroversial, and have driven the process of subtyping away from teaching\nsignals. Moreover, cancer genetic expression profiles are high-dimensional,\nscarce, and have complicated dependence, thereby posing a serious challenge to\nexisting subtyping models for outputting sensible clustering. In this study, we\npropose a novel clustering method for exploiting genetic expression profiles\nand distinguishing subtypes in an unsupervised manner. The proposed method\nadaptively learns categorical correspondence from latent representations of\nexpression profiles to the subtypes output by the model. By maximizing the\nproblem -- agnostic mutual information between input expression profiles and\noutput subtypes, our method can automatically decide a suitable number of\nsubtypes. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method can\nrefine existing controversial labels, and, by further medical analysis, this\nrefinement is proven to have a high correlation with cancer survival rates.",

Jointist consists of the instrument\nrecognition module that conditions the other modules: the transcription module\nthat outputs instrument-specific piano rolls, and the source separation module\nthat utilizes instrument information and transcription results.\nThe instrument conditioning is designed for an explicit multi-instrument\nfunctionality while the connection between the transcription and source\nseparation modules is for better transcription performance. Our challenging\nproblem formulation makes the model highly useful in the real world given that\nmodern popular music typically consists of multiple instruments. However, its\nnovelty necessitates a new perspective on how to evaluate such a model. During\nthe experiment, we assess the model from various aspects, providing a new\nevaluation perspective for multi-instrument transcription.

To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a black-box adversarial\nattack scheme based on semantic segmentation and model inversion (SSMI). We\nfirst locate the position of the target object using semantic segmentation\ntechniques. Next, we design a neighborhood background pixel replacement to\nreplace the target region pixels with background pixels to ensure that the\npixel modifications are not easily detected by human vision. Finally, we\nreconstruct a machine-recognizable example and use the mask matrix to select\npixels in the reconstructed example to modify the benign image to generate an\nadversarial example. Detailed experimental results show that SSMI can generate\nefficient adversarial examples to evade human-eye perception and make objects\nof interest disappear. And more importantly, SSMI outperforms existing same\nkinds of attacks. The maximum increase in new and disappearing labels is 16%,\nand the maximum decrease in mAP metrics for object detection is 36%.",

    "title": "iTiger: An Automatic Issue Title Generation Tool",
    "abstract": "In both commercial and open-source software, bug reports or issues are used\nto track bugs or feature requests. However, the quality of issues can differ a\nlot. Prior research has found that bug reports with good quality tend to gain\nmore attention than the ones with poor quality. As an essential component of an\nissue, title quality is an important aspect of issue quality. Moreover, issues\nare usually presented in a list view, where only the issue title and some\nmetadata are present. In this case, a concise and accurate title is crucial for\nreaders to grasp the general concept of the issue and facilitate the issue\ntriaging. Previous work formulated the issue title generation task as a\none-sentence summarization task. A sequence-to-sequence model was employed to\nsolve this task. However, it requires a large amount of domain-specific\ntraining data to attain good performance in issue title generation. Recently,\npre-trained models, which learned knowledge from large-scale general corpora,\nhave shown much success in software engineering tasks.\nIn this work, we make the first attempt to fine-tune BART, which has been\npre-trained using English corpora, to generate issue titles. We implemented the\nfine-tuned BART as a web tool named iTiger, which can suggest an issue title\nbased on the issue description. iTiger is fine-tuned on 267,094 GitHub issues.\nWe compared iTiger with the state-of-the-art method, i.e., iTAPE, on 33,438\nissues. The automatic evaluation shows that iTiger outperforms iTAPE by 29.7%,\n50.8%, and 34.1%, in terms of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L F1-scores. The manual\nevaluation also demonstrates the titles generated by BART are preferred by\nevaluators over the titles generated by iTAPE in 72.7% of cases. Besides, the\nevaluators deem our tool as useful and easy-to-use. They are also interested to\nuse our tool in the future.",

Two\nmetrics are suggested respectively for measuring absolute and relative\nsloppiness of the parameter vector at a prescribed value.

In this work, we\ncalibrate this tradeoff in a quantitative manner through a multi-criterion\noptimization-based framework, which we cast as a constrained program: the\nobjective for a device is its local objective, which it seeks to minimize while\nsatisfying nonlinear constraints that quantify the proximity between the local\nand the global model. By considering the Lagrangian relaxation of this problem,\nwe develop an algorithm that allows each node to minimize its local component\nof Lagrangian through queries to a first-order gradient oracle. Then, the\nserver executes Lagrange multiplier ascent steps followed by a Lagrange\nmultiplier-weighted averaging step. We call this instantiation of the\nprimal-dual method Federated Learning Beyond Consensus ($\\texttt{FedBC}$).\nTheoretically, we establish that $\\texttt{FedBC}$ converges to a first-order\nstationary point at rates that matches the state of the art, up to an\nadditional error term that depends on the tolerance parameter that arises due\nto the proximity constraints. Overall, the analysis is a novel characterization\nof primal-dual methods applied to non-convex saddle point problems with\nnonlinear constraints.

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs), originally inspired by biological neural\nnetworks (BNNs), have achieved remarkable successes in many tasks such as\nvisual representation learning. However, whether there exists semantic\ncorrelations/connections between the visual representations in ANNs and those\nin BNNs remains largely unexplored due to both the lack of an effective tool to\nlink and couple two different domains, and the lack of a general and effective\nframework of representing the visual semantics in BNNs such as human functional\nbrain networks (FBNs). To answer this question, we propose a novel\ncomputational framework, Synchronized Activations (Sync-ACT), to couple the\nvisual representation spaces and semantics between ANNs and BNNs in human brain\nbased on naturalistic functional magnetic resonance imaging (nfMRI) data. With\nthis approach, we are able to semantically annotate the neurons in ANNs with\nbiologically meaningful description derived from human brain imaging for the\nfirst time. We evaluated the Sync-ACT framework on two publicly available\nmovie-watching nfMRI datasets. The experiments demonstrate a) the significant\ncorrelation and similarity of the semantics between the visual representations\nin FBNs and those in a variety of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) models;\nb) the close relationship between CNN's visual representation similarity to\nBNNs and its performance in image classification tasks.

    "abstract": "Modeling the recovery of interdependent critical infrastructure is a key\ncomponent of quantifying and optimizing societal resilience to disruptive\nevents. However, simulating the recovery of large-scale interdependent systems\nunder random disruptive events is computationally expensive. Therefore, we\npropose the application of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) in this paper to\naccelerate the recovery modeling of interdependent systems. DeepONets are ML\narchitectures which identify mathematical operators from data. The form of\ngoverning equations DeepONets identify and the governing equation of\ninterdependent systems recovery model are similar. Therefore, we hypothesize\nthat DeepONets can efficiently model the interdependent systems recovery with\nlittle training data. We applied DeepONets to a simple case of four\ninterdependent systems with sixteen states. DeepONets, overall, performed\nsatisfactorily in predicting the recovery of these interdependent systems for\nout of training sample data when compared to reference results.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in the industrial inspection of textured surfaces-in the form\nof visual inspection-have made such inspections possible for efficient,\nflexible manufacturing systems. We propose an unsupervised feature memory\nrearrangement network (FMR-Net) to accurately detect various textural defects\nsimultaneously. Consistent with mainstream methods, we adopt the idea of\nbackground reconstruction; however, we innovatively utilize artificial\nsynthetic defects to enable the model to recognize anomalies, while traditional\nwisdom relies only on defect-free samples. First, we employ an encoding module\nto obtain multiscale features of the textured surface. Subsequently, a\ncontrastive-learning-based memory feature module (CMFM) is proposed to obtain\ndiscriminative representations and construct a normal feature memory bank in\nthe latent space, which can be employed as a substitute for defects and fast\nanomaly scores at the patch level. Next, a novel global feature rearrangement\nmodule (GFRM) is proposed to further suppress the reconstruction of residual\ndefects. Finally, a decoding module utilizes the restored features to\nreconstruct the normal texture background. In addition, to improve inspection\nperformance, a two-phase training strategy is utilized for accurate defect\nrestoration refinement, and we exploit a multimodal inspection method to\nachieve noise-robust defect localization. We verify our method through\nextensive experiments and test its practical deployment in collaborative\nedge--cloud intelligent manufacturing scenarios by means of a multilevel\ndetection method, demonstrating that FMR-Net exhibits state-of-the-art\ninspection accuracy and shows great potential for use in edge-computing-enabled\nsmart industries.",

In this\nstudy, we show that existing graph-based Sybil detection methods can be\ninterpreted in a unified framework of low-pass filtering.

Our\nanalysis reveals that the detection performance of each method depends on how\nwell low-pass filtering can extract low frequency components and remove noisy\nhigh frequency components. Furthermore, on the basis of the analysis, we\npropose a novel Sybil detection method called SybilHeat.

In current recommendation systems, data\npoint insertions, deletions, and queries are streamed into the system in an\nonline fashion as users and items change dynamically.

To tackle the challenge, we propose an incremental proximity\ngraph maintenance (IPGM) algorithm for online ANN. IPGM supports both vertex\ndeletion and insertion on proximity graphs.

    "abstract": "Neural networks are prone to be biased towards spurious correlations between\nclasses and latent attributes exhibited in a major portion of training data,\nwhich ruins their generalization capability. This paper proposes a new method\nfor training debiased classifiers with no spurious attribute label. The key\nidea of the method is to employ a committee of classifiers as an auxiliary\nmodule that identifies bias-conflicting data, i.e., data without spurious\ncorrelations, and assigns large weights to them when training the main\nclassifier. The committee is learned as a bootstrapped ensemble so that a\nmajority of its classifiers are biased as well as being diverse, and\nintentionally fail to predict classes of bias-conflicting data accordingly. The\nconsensus within the committee on prediction difficulty thus provides a\nreliable cue for identifying and weighting bias-conflicting data. Moreover, the\ncommittee is also trained with knowledge transferred from the main classifier\nso that it gradually becomes debiased along with the main classifier and\nemphasizes more difficult data as training progresses. On five real-world\ndatasets, our method outperforms existing methods using no spurious attribute\nlabel like ours and even surpasses those relying on bias labels occasionally.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has entered the mobile era where an enormous number of\nML models are deployed on edge devices. However, running common ML models on\nedge devices continuously may generate excessive heat from the computation,\nforcing the device to \"slow down\" to prevent overheating, a phenomenon called\nthermal throttling. This paper studies the impact of thermal throttling on\nmobile phones: when it occurs, the CPU clock frequency is reduced, and the\nmodel inference latency may increase dramatically. This unpleasant inconsistent\nbehavior has a substantial negative effect on user experience, but it has been\noverlooked for a long time. To counter thermal throttling, we propose to\nutilize dynamic networks with shared weights and dynamically shift between\nlarge and small ML models seamlessly according to their thermal profile, i.e.,\nshifting to a small model when the system is about to throttle. With the\nproposed dynamic shifting, the application runs consistently without\nexperiencing CPU clock frequency degradation and latency increase. In addition,\nwe also study the resulting accuracy when dynamic shifting is deployed and show\nthat our approach provides a reasonable trade-off between model latency and\nmodel accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Whole slide image (WSI) classification is a fundamental task for the\ndiagnosis and treatment of diseases; but, curation of accurate labels is\ntime-consuming and limits the application of fully-supervised methods. To\naddress this, multiple instance learning (MIL) is a popular method that poses\nclassification as a weakly supervised learning task with slide-level labels\nonly. While current MIL methods apply variants of the attention mechanism to\nre-weight instance features with stronger models, scant attention is paid to\nthe properties of the data distribution. In this work, we propose to\nre-calibrate the distribution of a WSI bag (instances) by using the statistics\nof the max-instance (critical) feature. We assume that in binary MIL, positive\nbags have larger feature magnitudes than negatives, thus we can enforce the\nmodel to maximize the discrepancy between bags with a metric feature loss that\nmodels positive bags as out-of-distribution. To achieve this, unlike existing\nMIL methods that use single-batch training modes, we propose balanced-batch\nsampling to effectively use the feature loss i.e., (+/-) bags simultaneously.\nFurther, we employ a position encoding module (PEM) to model\nspatial/morphological information, and perform pooling by multi-head\nself-attention (PSMA) with a Transformer encoder. Experimental results on\nexisting benchmark datasets show our approach is effective and improves over\nstate-of-the-art MIL methods.",

The aim of this study was to explore and evaluate the usefulness of\nsuch classifications to users in the context of exploring an emerging research\narea. I conducted four interviews with managers of a project aimed to support\nresearch and application of artificial intelligence at the Swedish medical\nuniversity Karolinska Institutet.

The interviews showed that the aim of the project was to\nimprove competence, enhance communication between researchers and develop\nsupport structures.

In this paper we propose a simple variation of this\nclassical approach where, to more effectively recover precision, we decouple\nthe two phases: in particular, before starting the descending phase, we replace\nthe domain $\\mathbb{A}$ with a more precise abstract domain $\\mathbb{D}$.

However, these benefits rely on the\nefficient detection strategy at the receiver and come at the expense of the\nextra bandwidth consumed by the cyclic prefix (CP). We use the iterative\northogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm in this paper as the\nprototype of the detector because of its remarkable potential for interference\nsuppression. However, OAMP is computationally expensive for the matrix\ninversion per iteration. We replace the matrix inversion with the conjugate\ngradient (CG) method to reduce the complexity of OAMP. We further unfold the\nCG-based OAMP algorithm into a network and tune the critical parameters through\ndeep learning (DL) to enhance detection performance. Simulation results and\ncomplexity analysis show that the proposed scheme has significant gain over\nother iterative detection methods and exhibits comparable performance to the\nstate-of-the-art DL-based detector at a reduced computational cost.\nFurthermore, we design a highly efficient CP-free MIMO-OFDM receiver\narchitecture to remove the CP overhead. This architecture first eliminates the\nintersymbol interference by buffering the previously recovered data and then\ndetects the signal using the proposed detector. Numerical experiments\ndemonstrate that the designed receiver offers a higher spectral efficiency than\ntraditional receivers.

Unlike traditional methods that require two\nsteps for shadow detection and then shadow removal, the SpA-Former unifies\nthese steps into one, which is a one-stage network capable of directly learning\nthe mapping function between shadows and no shadows, it does not require a\nseparate shadow detection. Thus, SpA-former is adaptable to real image\nde-shadowing for shadows projected on different semantic regions. SpA-Former\nconsists of transformer layer and a series of joint Fourier transform residual\nblocks and two-wheel joint spatial attention. The network in this paper is able\nto handle the task while achieving a very fast processing efficiency.\nOur code is relased on https://github.com/\nzhangbaijin/Spatial-Transformer-shadow-removal",

    "abstract": "The recent advances in transfer learning techniques and pre-training of large\ncontextualized encoders foster innovation in real-life applications, including\ndialog assistants. Practical needs of intent recognition require effective data\nusage and the ability to constantly update supported intents, adopting new\nones, and abandoning outdated ones. In particular, the generalized zero-shot\nparadigm, in which the model is trained on the seen intents and tested on both\nseen and unseen intents, is taking on new importance. In this paper, we explore\nthe generalized zero-shot setup for intent recognition. Following best\npractices for zero-shot text classification, we treat the task with a sentence\npair modeling approach. We outperform previous state-of-the-art f1-measure by\nup to 16\\% for unseen intents, using intent labels and user utterances and\nwithout accessing external sources (such as knowledge bases). Further\nenhancement includes lexicalization of intent labels, which improves\nperformance by up to 7\\%. By using task transferring from other sentence pair\ntasks, such as Natural Language Inference, we gain additional improvements.",

Here, these concepts are extended to\nthe realm of iterative methods by formally defining locally conservative and\nflux consistent iterations. These concepts are of both theoretical and\npractical importance: Based on recent work by the authors, it is shown that\npseudo-time iterations using explicit Runge-Kutta methods are locally\nconservative but not necessarily flux consistent. An extension of the\nLax-Wendroff theorem is presented, revealing convergence towards weak solutions\nof a temporally retarded system of conservation laws. Each equation is modified\nin the same way, namely by a particular scalar factor multiplying the spatial\nflux terms. A technique for enforcing flux consistency, and thereby recovering\nconvergence, is presented. Further, local conservation is established for all\nKrylov subspace methods, with and without restarts, and for Newton's method\nunder certain assumptions on the discretization. Thus it is shown that\nNewton-Krylov methods are locally conservative, although not necessarily flux\nconsistent. Numerical experiments with the 2D compressible Euler equations\ncorroborate the theoretical results. Further numerical investigations of the\nimpact of flux consistency on Newton-Krylov methods indicate that its effect is\ncase dependent, and diminishes as the number of iterations grow.",

The content similarity and sentimental tendency of\nnetwork community users are taken as node attributes, and on this basis, an\nundirected weighted network is constructed for community detection. This paper\nconducts experiments with actual data and analyzes the experimental results. It\nis found that the modularity of the community detection results is high and the\neffect is good.",

But a large amount\nof repetitive and mechanical work occupies most of the time of human agents, so\nthe cost of equipment and labor for enterprises is increasing accordingly. At\nthe same time, with the development of artificial intelligence technology in\nthe past few decades, it has become quite common for companies to use new\ntechnologies such as Big Data and artificial intelligence to empower outbound\ncall businesses. The intelligent outbound robot is a typical application of the\nartificial intelligence technology in the field of outbound call businesses. It\nis mainly used to communicate with customers in order to accomplish a certain\ntarget. It has the characteristics of low cost, high reuse, and easy\ncompliance, which has attracted more attention from the industry.\nAt present, there are two kinds of intelligent outbound robots in the\nindustry but both of them still leave large room for improvement. One kind of\nthem is based on a finite state machine relying on the configuration of jump\nconditions and corresponding nodes based on manual experience. This kind of\nintelligent outbound robot is also called a flow-based robot. For example, the\nschematic diagram of the working model of a flow-based robot for debt\ncollection is shown in Fig.\\ref{fig:label}.

    "abstract": "We address the problem of coding for multiple-access channels (MACs) with the\nassistance of non-signaling correlations between parties. It is well-known that\nnon-signaling assistance does not change the capacity of point-to-point\nchannels. However, it was recently observed that one can construct MACs from\ntwo-player non-local games while relating the winning probability of the game\nto the capacity of the MAC. By considering games for which entanglement (a\nspecial kind of non-signaling correlation) increases the winning probability\n(e.g., the Magic Square game), this shows that for some specific kinds of\nchannels, entanglement between the senders can increase the capacity.\nHere, we show that the increase in capacity from non-signaling assistance\ngoes beyond such special channels and applies even to a simple deterministic\nMAC: the binary adder channel. In particular, we show that, with non-signaling\nassistance, a sum-rate of $\\frac{\\log_2(72)}{4} \\simeq 1.5425$ can be reached\nwith zero error, beating the maximum classical sum-rate capacity of\n$\\frac{3}{2}$. Furthermore, we show that this capacity increase persists if a\nsmall amount of noise is added to the channel.\nIn order to achieve this, we show that efficient linear programs can be\nformulated to compute the success probability of the best non-signaling\nassisted code for a finite number of copies of a multiple-access channel. In\nparticular, this can be used to give lower bounds on the zero-error\nnon-signaling assisted capacity of multiple-access channels.",

It has been observed that the reduction of the search\nspace size granted by ad-hoc crossover and mutation operators does not usually\ntranslate to a substantial improvement of the GA performances. There is still\nno clear explanation of this phenomenon, although it is suspected that a\nbalanced representation might yield a more irregular fitness landscape, where\nit could be more difficult for GA to converge to a global optimum. In this\npaper, we investigate this issue by adding a local search step to a GA with\nbalanced operators, and use it to evolve highly nonlinear balanced Boolean\nfunctions. In particular, we organize our experiments around two research\nquestions, namely if local search (1) improves the convergence speed of GA, and\n(2) decreases the population diversity. Surprisingly, while our results answer\naffirmatively the first question, they also show that adding local search\nactually \\emph{increases} the diversity among the individuals in the\npopulation.

During the training phase,\nmost of the existing multi-task learning models concentrate entirely on the\ntarget task data and ignore the non-target task data contained in the target\ntasks. To address this issue, Universum data, that do not correspond to any\nclass of a classification problem, may be used as prior knowledge in the\ntraining model. This study looks at the challenge of multi-task learning using\nUniversum data to employ non-target task data, which leads to better\nperformance. It proposes a multi-task twin support vector machine with\nUniversum data (UMTSVM) and provides two approaches to its solution. The first\napproach takes into account the dual formulation of UMTSVM and tries to solve a\nquadratic programming problem. The second approach formulates a least-squares\nversion of UMTSVM and refers to it as LS-UMTSVM to further increase the\ngeneralization performance. The solution of the two primal problems in\nLS-UMTSVM is simplified to solving just two systems of linear equations,\nresulting in an incredibly simple and quick approach.

In this paper, an\nauthentication model for identity documents based on forgery detection of\nguilloche patterns is proposed. The proposed approach is made up of two steps:\nfeature extraction and similarity measure between a pair of feature vectors of\nidentity documents. The feature extraction step involves learning the\nsimilarity between a pair of identity documents via a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) architecture and ends by extracting highly discriminative\nfeatures between them. While, the similarity measure step is applied to decide\nif a given identity document is authentic or forged. In this work, these two\nsteps are combined together to achieve two objectives: (i) extracted features\nshould have good anticollision (discriminative) capabilities to distinguish\nbetween a pair of identity documents belonging to different classes, (ii)\nchecking out the conformity of the guilloche pattern of a given identity\ndocument and its similarity to the guilloche pattern of an authentic version of\nthe same country. Experiments are conducted in order to analyze and identify\nthe most proper parameters to achieve higher authentication performance. The\nexperimental results are performed on the MIDV-2020 dataset. The results show\nthe ability of the proposed approach to extract the relevant characteristics of\nthe processed pair of identity documents in order to model the guilloche\npatterns, and thus distinguish them correctly.

We perform\nspectral analysis of the solutions and conclude that gradient flow graph\nconvolutional models can induce a dynamics dominated by the graph high\nfrequencies which is desirable for heterophilic datasets. We also describe\nstructural constraints on common GNN architectures allowing to interpret them\nas gradient flows. We perform thorough ablation studies corroborating our\ntheoretical analysis and show competitive performance of simple and lightweight\nmodels on real-world homophilic and heterophilic datasets.",

    "abstract": "Social aspects in software development teams are of particular importance for\na successful project closure. To analyze sentiments in software projects, there\nare several tools and approaches available. These tools analyze text-based\ncommunication based on the used words to predict whether they appear to be\npositive, negative, or neutral for the receiver of the message. In the research\nproject ComContA, we investigate so-called sentiment analysis striving to\nanalyze the content of text-based communication in development teams with\nregard to the statement's polarity. That is, we analyze whether the\ncommunication appears to be adequate (i.e., positive or neutral) or negative.\nIn a workshop paper, we presented a tool called SEnti-Analyzer that allows to\napply sentiment analysis to verbal communication in meetings of software\nprojects. In this technical report, we present the extended functionalities of\nthe SEnti-Analyzer by also allowing the analysis of text-based communication,\nwe improve the prediction of the tool by including established sentiment\nanalysis tools, and we evaluate the tool with respect to its accuracy. We\nevaluate the tool by comparing the prediction of the SEnti-Analyzer to\npre-labeled established data sets used for sentiment analysis in software\nengineering and to perceptions of computer scientists. Our results indicate\nthat in almost all cases at least two of the three votes coincide, but in only\nabout half of the cases all three votes coincide. Our results raise the\nquestion of the \"ultimate truth\" of sentiment analysis outcomes: What do we\nwant to predict with sentiment analysis tools? The pre-defined labels of\nestablished data sets? The perception of computer scientists? Or the perception\nof single computer scientists which appears to be the most meaningful\nobjective?",

During CLIP training, the InfoNCE objective aims to align positive\nimage-text pairs and separate negative ones. In this paper, we show a\nrepresentation grouping effect during this process: the InfoNCE objective\nindirectly groups semantically similar representations together via randomly\nemerged within-modal anchors. We introduce Prototypical Contrastive Language\nImage Pretraining (ProtoCLIP) to enhance such grouping by boosting its\nefficiency and increasing its robustness against modality gap. Specifically,\nProtoCLIP sets up prototype-level discrimination between image and text spaces,\nwhich efficiently transfers higher-level structural knowledge. We further\npropose Prototypical Back Translation (PBT) to decouple representation grouping\nfrom representation alignment, resulting in effective learning of meaningful\nrepresentations under large modality gap. PBT also enables us to introduce\nadditional external teachers with richer prior knowledge. ProtoCLIP is trained\nwith an online episodic training strategy, which makes it can be scaled up to\nunlimited amounts of data. Combining the above novel designs, we train our\nProtoCLIP on Conceptual Captions and achieved an +5.81% ImageNet linear probing\nimprovement and an +2.01% ImageNet zero-shot classification improvement.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks implement a sequence of layer-by-layer operations that\nare each relatively easy to understand, but the resulting overall computation\nis generally difficult to understand. We develop a simple idea for interpreting\nthe layer-by-layer construction of useful representations: the role of each\nlayer is to reformat information to reduce the \"distance\" to the target\noutputs. We formalize this intuitive idea of \"distance\" by leveraging recent\nwork on metric representational similarity, and show how it leads to a rich\nspace of geometric concepts. With this framework, the layer-wise computation\nimplemented by a deep neural network can be viewed as a path in a\nhigh-dimensional representation space. We develop tools to characterize the\ngeometry of these in terms of distances, angles, and geodesics. We then ask\nthree sets of questions of residual networks trained on CIFAR-10: (1) how\nstraight are paths, and how does each layer contribute towards the target? (2)\nhow do these properties emerge over training? and (3) how similar are the paths\ntaken by wider versus deeper networks? We conclude by sketching additional ways\nthat this kind of representational geometry can be used to understand and\ninterpret network training, or to prescriptively improve network architectures\nto suit a task.",

In this work, we propose Auto-Encoding Adversarial Imitation\nLearning (AEAIL), a robust and scalable AIL framework.

    "abstract": "Weakly-supervised action localization aims to localize and classify action\ninstances in the given videos temporally with only video-level categorical\nlabels. Thus, the crucial issue of existing weakly-supervised action\nlocalization methods is the limited supervision from the weak annotations for\nprecise predictions. In this work, we propose a hierarchical mining strategy\nunder video-level and snippet-level manners, i.e., hierarchical supervision and\nhierarchical consistency mining, to maximize the usage of the given annotations\nand prediction-wise consistency. To this end, a Hierarchical Mining Network\n(HiM-Net) is proposed. Concretely, it mines hierarchical supervision for\nclassification in two grains: one is the video-level existence for ground truth\ncategories captured by multiple instance learning; the other is the\nsnippet-level inexistence for each negative-labeled category from the\nperspective of complementary labels, which is optimized by our proposed\ncomplementary label learning. As for hierarchical consistency, HiM-Net explores\nvideo-level co-action feature similarity and snippet-level\nforeground-background opposition, for discriminative representation learning\nand consistent foreground-background separation. Specifically, prediction\nvariance is viewed as uncertainty to select the pairs with high consensus for\nproposed foreground-background collaborative learning. Comprehensive\nexperimental results show that HiM-Net outperforms existing methods on THUMOS14\nand ActivityNet1.3 datasets with large margins by hierarchically mining the\nsupervision and consistency.

    "abstract": "Object-centric process mining is a new paradigm with more realistic\nassumptions about underlying data by considering several case notions, e.g., an\norder handling process can be analyzed based on order, item, package, and route\ncase notions. Including many case notions can result in a very complex model.\nTo cope with such complexity, this paper introduces a new approach to cluster\nsimilar case notions based on Markov Directly-Follow Multigraph, which is an\nextended version of the well-known Directly-Follow Graph supported by many\nindustrial and academic process mining tools. This graph is used to calculate a\nsimilarity matrix for discovering clusters of similar case notions based on a\nthreshold. A threshold tuning algorithm is also defined to identify sets of\ndifferent clusters that can be discovered based on different levels of\nsimilarity. Thus, the cluster discovery will not rely on merely analysts'\nassumptions. The approach is implemented and released as a part of a python\nlibrary, called processmining, and it is evaluated through a Purchase to Pay\n(P2P) object-centric event log file. Some discovered clusters are evaluated by\ndiscovering Directly Follow-Multigraph by flattening the log based on the\nclusters.

In this paper, we propose a generic partial attention mechanism,\nwhich adopts the previous priority values (i.e., the number of\nadditionally-covered code units) to avoid considering all candidate test cases.\nIncorporating the mechanism with the additional-greedy strategy, we implement a\nnovel coverage-based TCP technique based on partition ordering (OCP). OCP first\ngroups the candidate test cases into different partitions and updates the\npartitions on the descending order. We conduct a comprehensive experiment on 19\nversions of Java programs and 30 versions of C programs to compare the\neffectiveness and efficiency of OCP with six state-of-the-art TCP techniques:\ntotal-greedy, additional-greedy, lexicographical-greedy, unify-greedy,\nart-based, and search-based.

    "abstract": "We present KeyCLD, a framework to learn Lagrangian dynamics from images.\nLearned keypoints represent semantic landmarks in images and can directly\nrepresent state dynamics. Interpreting this state as Cartesian coordinates\ncoupled with explicit holonomic constraints, allows expressing the dynamics\nwith a constrained Lagrangian. Our method explicitly models kinetic and\npotential energy, thus allowing energy based control. We are the first to\ndemonstrate learning of Lagrangian dynamics from images on the dm_control\npendulum, cartpole and acrobot environments. This is a step forward towards\nlearning Lagrangian dynamics from real-world images, since previous work in\nliterature was only applied to minimalistic images with monochromatic shapes on\nempty backgrounds.

    "abstract": "The increasing reach and functionality of voice assistants has allowed them\nto become a general-purpose platform for tasks like playing music, accessing\ninformation, and controlling smart home devices. In order to maintain the\nquality of third-party skills and to protect children and other members of the\npublic from inappropriate or malicious skills, platform providers have\ndeveloped content policies and certification procedures that skills must\nundergo prior to public release. Unfortunately, research suggests that these\nmeasures have been ineffective at curating voice assistant platforms, with\ndocumented instances of skills with significant security and privacy problems.\nThis provocation paper outlines how the underlying architectures of these\nplatforms had turned skill certification into a seemingly intractable problem,\nas well as how current certification methods fall short of their full\npotential. We present a roadmap for improving the state of skill certification\non contemporary voice assistant platforms, including research directions and\nactions that need to be taken by platform vendors. Promoting this change in\ndomestic voice assistants is especially important, as developers of commercial\nand industrial assistants or other similar contexts increasingly look to these\ndevices for norms and conventions.",

    "abstract": "Visual question answering (VQA) in surgery is largely unexplored. Expert\nsurgeons are scarce and are often overloaded with clinical and academic\nworkloads. This overload often limits their time answering questionnaires from\npatients, medical students or junior residents related to surgical procedures.\nAt times, students and junior residents also refrain from asking too many\nquestions during classes to reduce disruption. While computer-aided simulators\nand recording of past surgical procedures have been made available for them to\nobserve and improve their skills, they still hugely rely on medical experts to\nanswer their questions. Having a Surgical-VQA system as a reliable 'second\nopinion' could act as a backup and ease the load on the medical experts in\nanswering these questions. The lack of annotated medical data and the presence\nof domain-specific terms has limited the exploration of VQA for surgical\nprocedures. In this work, we design a Surgical-VQA task that answers\nquestionnaires on surgical procedures based on the surgical scene. Extending\nthe MICCAI endoscopic vision challenge 2018 dataset and workflow recognition\ndataset further, we introduce two Surgical-VQA datasets with classification and\nsentence-based answers. To perform Surgical-VQA, we employ vision-text\ntransformers models. We further introduce a residual MLP-based VisualBert\nencoder model that enforces interaction between visual and text tokens,\nimproving performance in classification-based answering. Furthermore, we study\nthe influence of the number of input image patches and temporal visual features\non the model performance in both classification and sentence-based answering.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been widely used\nin many practical applications, where each agent makes a decision based on its\nown observation. Most mainstream methods treat each local observation as an\nentirety when modeling the decentralized local utility functions. However, they\nignore the fact that local observation information can be further divided into\nseveral entities, and only part of the entities is helpful to model inference.\nMoreover, the importance of different entities may change over time. To improve\nthe performance of decentralized policies, the attention mechanism is used to\ncapture features of local information. Nevertheless, existing attention models\nrely on dense fully connected graphs and cannot better perceive important\nstates. To this end, we propose a sparse state based MARL (S2RL) framework,\nwhich utilizes a sparse attention mechanism to discard irrelevant information\nin local observations. The local utility functions are estimated through the\nself-attention and sparse attention mechanisms separately, then are combined\ninto a standard joint value function and auxiliary joint value function in the\ncentral critic. We design the S2RL framework as a plug-and-play module, making\nit general enough to be applied to various methods. Extensive experiments on\nStarCraft II show that S2RL can significantly improve the performance of many\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Reducing sensor requirements while keeping optimal control performance is\ncrucial to many industrial control applications to achieve robust, low-cost,\nand computation-efficient controllers. However, existing feature selection\nsolutions for the typical machine learning domain can hardly be applied in the\ndomain of control with changing dynamics. In this paper, a novel framework,\nnamely the Dual-world embedded Attentive Feature Selection (D-AFS), can\nefficiently select the most relevant sensors for the system under dynamic\ncontrol. Rather than the one world used in most Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(DRL) algorithms, D-AFS has both the real world and its virtual peer with\ntwisted features. By analyzing the DRL's response in two worlds, D-AFS can\nquantitatively identify respective features' importance towards control. A\nwell-known active flow control problem, cylinder drag reduction, is used for\nevaluation. Results show that D-AFS successfully finds an optimized five-probes\nlayout with 18.7\\% drag reduction than the state-of-the-art solution with 151\nprobes and 49.2\\% reduction than five-probes layout by human experts. We also\napply this solution to four OpenAI classical control cases. In all cases, D-AFS\nachieves the same or better sensor configurations than originally provided\nsolutions.

It also requires thinking through the normative question of what\nbeneficial use of AI in society looks like, which is equally challenging.\nThough different groups may agree on high-level principles that uses of AI\nshould respect (e.g., privacy, fairness, and autonomy), challenges arise when\nputting these principles into practice. For example, it is straightforward to\nsay that AI systems must protect individual privacy, but there is presumably\nsome amount or type of privacy that most people would be willing to give up to\ndevelop life-saving medical treatments.

Specifically, the proposed relational graph\nrepresentation consists of two key sub-graphs: aggregation graph and affine\ngraph. The former one considers ViT tokens as nodes and describes their spatial\ninteraction, while the latter one regards network channels as nodes and\nreflects the information communication between channels. Using this unified\nrelational graph representation, we found that: a) a sweet spot of the\naggregation graph leads to ViTs with significantly improved predictive\nperformance; b) the graph measures of clustering coefficient and average path\nlength are two effective indicators of model prediction performance, especially\nwhen applying on the datasets with small samples; c) our findings are\nconsistent across various ViT architectures and multiple datasets; d) the\nproposed relational graph representation of ViT has high similarity with real\nBNNs derived from brain science data. Overall, our work provides a novel\nunified and biologically-plausible paradigm for more interpretable and\neffective representation of ViT ANNs.",

    "abstract": "Many of the key enabling technologies of the fifth-generation (5G), such as\nnetwork slicing, spectrum sharing, and federated learning, rely on a\ncentralized authority. This may lead to pitfalls in terms of security or single\npoint of failure. Distributed ledger technology, specifically blockchain, is\ncurrently employed by different applications related to the Internet of Things\n(IoT) and 5G to address the drawbacks of centralized systems. For this reason,\nmobile blockchain networks (MBNs) have recently attracted a great deal of\nattention. To add a transaction to the blockchain in MBNs, mobile or IoT users\nmust perform various tasks like encryption, decryption, and mining. These tasks\nrequire energy and processing power, which impose limitations on mobile and IoT\nusers' performance because they are usually battery powered and have a low\nprocessing power. One possible solution is to perform the tasks virtually on\ncommodity servers provided by mobile edge computing (MEC) or cloud computing.\nTo do so, all tasks needed to add a transaction to the blockchain can be\ntreated as virtual blockchain functions that can be executed on commodity\nservers. We introduce a blockchain virtualization framework called blockchain\nfunction virtualization (BFV), through which all blockchain functions can be\nperformed virtually by MEC or cloud computing. Furthermore, we describe\napplications of the BFV framework and resource allocation challenges brought by\nthe BFV framework in mobile networks. In addition, to illustrate the advantages\nof BFV, we define an optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the energy\nconsumption cost and maximize miners' rewards. Finally, simulation results show\nthe performance of the proposed framework in terms of total energy consumption,\ntransaction confirmation rate, and miners' average profit.",

    "abstract": "With accurate and timely traffic forecasting, the impacted traffic conditions\ncan be predicted in advance to guide agencies and residents to respond to\nchanges in traffic patterns appropriately. However, existing works on traffic\nforecasting mainly relied on historical traffic patterns confining to\nshort-term prediction, under 1 hour, for instance. To better manage future\nroadway capacity and accommodate social and human impacts, it is crucial to\npropose a flexible and comprehensive framework to predict physical-aware\nlong-term traffic conditions for public users and transportation agencies. In\nthis paper, the gap of robust long-term traffic forecasting was bridged by\ntaking social media features into consideration. A correlation study and a\nlinear regression model were first implemented to evaluate the significance of\nthe correlation between two time-series data, traffic intensity and Twitter\ndata intensity. Two time-series data were then fed into our proposed\nsocial-aware framework, Traffic-Twitter Transformer, which integrated Nature\nLanguage representations into time-series records for long-term traffic\nprediction. Experimental results in the Great Seattle Area showed that our\nproposed model outperformed baseline models in all evaluation matrices. This\nNLP-joined social-aware framework can become a valuable implement of\nnetwork-wide traffic prediction and management for traffic agencies.",

Recent gait recognition\nmethods focus on learning the pattern of human movement or appearance during\nwalking, and construct the corresponding spatio-temporal representations.\nHowever, different individuals have their own laws of movement patterns, simple\nspatial-temporal features are difficult to describe changes in motion of human\nparts, especially when confounding variables such as clothing and carrying are\nincluded, thus distinguishability of features is reduced. In this paper, we\npropose the Motion Excitation Module (MEM) to guide spatio-temporal features to\nfocus on human parts with large dynamic changes, MEM learns the difference\ninformation between frames and intervals, so as to obtain the representation of\ntemporal motion changes, it is worth mentioning that MEM can adapt to frame\nsequences with uncertain length, and it does not add any additional parameters.\nFurthermore, we present the Fine Feature Extractor (FFE), which independently\nlearns the spatio-temporal representations of human body according to different\nhorizontal parts of individuals.

Moreover, the\ncomplexity of this trade-off is compounded in the heterogeneous graph case due\nto the disparate heterophily relationships between nodes of different types.

The corresponding minimizer is fully\ndifferentiable with respect to the energy function parameters, such that\nbilevel optimization can be applied to effectively learn a functional form\nwhose minimum provides optimal node representations for subsequent\nclassification tasks.

Consequently, many studies were\nconducted to find out how developers could be supported during code\ncomprehension and which code characteristics contribute to better\ncomprehension. Today, such experiments are more common than ever. While this is\ngreat for advancing the field, the number of publications makes it difficult to\nkeep an overview. Additionally, designing rigorous experiments with human\nparticipants is a challenging task, and the multitude of design decisions and\noptions can make it difficult for researchers to select a suitable design.\nWe therefore conducted a systematic mapping study of 95 source code\ncomprehension experiments published between 1979 and 2019. By systematically\nstructuring the design characteristics of code comprehension studies, we\nprovide a basis for subsequent discussion of the huge diversity of design\noptions in the face of a lack of basic research on their consequences and\ncomparability. We describe what topics have been studied, as well as how these\nstudies have been designed, conducted, and reported. Frequently chosen design\noptions and deficiencies are pointed out.

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles use a variety of sensors and machine-learned models to\npredict the behavior of surrounding road users. Most of the machine-learned\nmodels in the literature focus on quantitative error metrics like the root mean\nsquare error (RMSE) to learn and report their models' capabilities. This focus\non quantitative error metrics tends to ignore the more important behavioral\naspect of the models, raising the question of whether these models really\npredict human-like behavior. Thus, we propose to analyze the output of\nmachine-learned models much like we would analyze human data in conventional\nbehavioral research. We introduce quantitative metrics to demonstrate presence\nof three different behavioral phenomena in a naturalistic highway driving\ndataset: 1) The kinematics-dependence of who passes a merging point first 2)\nLane change by an on-highway vehicle to accommodate an on-ramp vehicle 3) Lane\nchanges by vehicles on the highway to avoid lead vehicle conflicts. Then, we\nanalyze the behavior of three machine-learned models using the same metrics.\nEven though the models' RMSE value differed, all the models captured the\nkinematic-dependent merging behavior but struggled at varying degrees to\ncapture the more nuanced courtesy lane change and highway lane change behavior.\nAdditionally, the collision aversion analysis during lane changes showed that\nthe models struggled to capture the physical aspect of human driving: leaving\nadequate gap between the vehicles. Thus, our analysis highlighted the\ninadequacy of simple quantitative metrics and the need to take a broader\nbehavioral perspective when analyzing machine-learned models of human driving\npredictions.",

    "abstract": "A temporal graph is an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ along with a function that\nassigns a time-label to each edge in $E$. A path in $G$ with non-decreasing\ntime-labels is called temporal path and the distance from $u$ to $v$ is the\nminimum length (i.e., the number of edges) of a temporal path from $u$ to $v$.\nA temporal $\\alpha$-spanner of $G$ is a (temporal) subgraph $H$ that preserves\nthe distances between any pair of vertices in $V$, up to a multiplicative\nstretch factor of $\\alpha$. The size of $H$ is the number of its edges.\nIn this work we study the size-stretch trade-offs of temporal spanners. We\nshow that temporal cliques always admit a temporal $(2k-1)-$spanner with\n$\\tilde{O}(kn^{1+\\frac{1}{k}})$ edges, where $k>1$ is an integer parameter of\nchoice. Choosing $k=\\lfloor\\log n\\rfloor$, we obtain a temporal $O(\\log\nn)$-spanner with $\\tilde{O}(n)$ edges that has almost the same size (up to\nlogarithmic factors) as the temporal spanner in [Casteigts et al., JCSS 2021]\nwhich only preserves temporal connectivity.\nWe then consider general temporal graphs. Since $\\Omega(n^2)$ edges might be\nneeded by any connectivity-preserving temporal subgraph [Axiotis et al.,\nICALP'16], we focus on approximating distances from a single source. We show\nthat $\\tilde{O}(n/\\log(1+\\varepsilon))$ edges suffice to obtain a stretch of\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$, for any small $\\varepsilon>0$. This result is essentially\ntight since there are temporal graphs for which any temporal subgraph\npreserving exact distances from a single-source must use $\\Omega(n^2)$ edges.\nWe extend our analysis to prove an upper bound of $\\tilde{O}(n^2/\\beta)$ on the\nsize of any temporal $\\beta$-additive spanner, which is tight up to\npolylogarithmic factors.\nFinally, we investigate how the lifetime of $G$, i.e., the number of its\ndistinct time-labels, affects the trade-off between the size and the stretch of\na temporal spanner.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary game theory has been a successful tool to combine classical game\ntheory with learning-dynamical descriptions in multiagent systems. Provided\nsome symmetric structures of interacting players, many studies have been\nfocused on using a simplified heuristic payoff table as input to analyse the\ndynamics of interactions. Nevertheless, even for the state-of-the-art method,\nthere are two limits. First, there is inaccuracy when analysing the simplified\npayoff table. Second, no existing work is able to deal with 2-population\nmultiplayer asymmetric games. In this paper, we fill the gap between heuristic\npayoff table and dynamic analysis without any inaccuracy. In addition, we\npropose a general framework for $m$ versus $n$ 2-population multiplayer\nasymmetric games. Then, we compare our method with the state-of-the-art in some\nclassic games. Finally, to illustrate our method, we perform empirical\ngame-theoretical analysis on Wolfpack as well as StarCraft II, both of which\ninvolve complex multiagent interactions.",

    "abstract": "We consider the fundamental problem of allocating a set of indivisible goods\namong strategic agents with additive valuation functions. It is well known\nthat, in the absence of monetary transfers, Pareto efficient and truthful rules\nare dictatorial, while there is no deterministic truthful mechanism that\nallocates all items and achieves envy-freeness up to one item (EF1), even for\nthe case of two agents. In this paper, we investigate the interplay of fairness\nand efficiency under a relaxation of truthfulness called non-obvious\nmanipulability (NOM), recently proposed by Troyan and Morrill. We show that\nthis relaxation allows us to bypass the aforementioned negative results in a\nvery strong sense. Specifically, we prove that there are deterministic and EF1\nalgorithms that are not obviously manipulable, and the algorithm that maximizes\nutilitarian social welfare (the sum of agents' utilities), which is Pareto\nefficient but not dictatorial, is not obviously manipulable for $n \\geq 3$\nagents (but obviously manipulable for $n=2$ agents). At the same time,\nmaximizing the egalitarian social welfare (the minimum of agents' utilities) or\nthe Nash social welfare (the product of agents' utilities) is obviously\nmanipulable for any number of agents and items. Our main result is an\napproximation preserving black-box reduction from the problem of designing EF1\nand NOM mechanisms to the problem of designing EF1 algorithms. En route, we\nprove an interesting structural result about EF1 allocations, as well as new\n\"best-of-both-worlds\" results (for the problem without incentives), that might\nbe of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we try to decipher the internal connection of NLP technology\ndevelopment in the past decades, searching for essence, which rewards us with a\n(potential) new learning paradigm for NLP tasks, dubbed as reStructured\nPre-training (RST). In such a paradigm, the role of data will be re-emphasized,\nand model pre-training and fine-tuning of downstream tasks are viewed as a\nprocess of data storing and accessing. Based on that, we operationalize the\nsimple principle that a good storage mechanism should not only have the ability\nto cache a large amount of data but also consider the ease of access. We\nachieve this by pre-training models over restructured data that consist of a\nvariety of valuable information instead of raw data after overcoming several\nengineering challenges. Experimentally, RST models not only surpass strong\ncompetitors (e.g., T0) on 52/55 popular datasets from a variety of NLP tasks,\nbut also achieve superior performance in National College Entrance Examination\n- English (Gaokao-English),the most authoritative examination in China.\nSpecifically, the proposed system Qin achieves 40 points higher than the\naverage scores made by students and 15 points higher than GPT3 with 1/16\nparameters. In particular, Qin gets a high score of 138.5 (the full mark is\n150) in the 2018 English exam (national paper III). We have released the Gaokao\nBenchmark with an online submission platform.\nIn addition, we test our model in the 2022 College Entrance Examination\nEnglish that happened a few days ago (2022.06.08), and it gets a total score of\n134 (v.s.

Therefore, prioritization and focus become critical, to spend their\nlimited time on the highest risk vulnerabilities. In doing this, it is\nimportant for these organizations not only to understand the technical\ndescriptions of the vulnerabilities, but also to gain insights into attackers'\nperspectives. In this work, we use machine learning and natural language\nprocessing techniques, as well as several publicly available data sets to\nprovide an explainable mapping of vulnerabilities to attack techniques and\nthreat actors. This work provides new security intelligence, by predicting\nwhich attack techniques are most likely to be used to exploit a given\nvulnerability and which threat actors are most likely to conduct the\nexploitation. Lack of labeled data and different vocabularies make mapping\nvulnerabilities to attack techniques at scale a challenging problem that cannot\nbe addressed easily using supervised or unsupervised (similarity search)\nlearning techniques. To solve this problem, we first map the vulnerabilities to\na standard set of common weaknesses, and then common weaknesses to the attack\ntechniques. This approach yields a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.95, an\naccuracy comparable with those reported for state-of-the-art systems.

    "abstract": "It is common in computer vision to be confronted with domain shift: images\nwhich have the same class but different acquisition conditions. In domain\nadaptation (DA), one wants to classify unlabeled target images using source\nlabeled images. Unfortunately, deep neural networks trained on a source\ntraining set perform poorly on target images which do not belong to the\ntraining domain. One strategy to improve these performances is to align the\nsource and target image distributions in an embedded space using optimal\ntransport (OT). However OT can cause negative transfer, i.e. aligning samples\nwith different labels, which leads to overfitting especially in the presence of\nlabel shift between domains. In this work, we mitigate negative alignment by\nexplaining it as a noisy label assignment to target images. We then mitigate\nits effect by appropriate regularization.

Starting from a deep\nprobabilistic generative model with attention, we measure the interaction\nbetween latent variables and realizations of syntactic roles and show that it\nis possible to obtain, without supervision, representations of sentences where\ndifferent syntactic roles correspond to clearly identified different latent\nvariables.

To\naddress this decision problem, we propose a new medical decision model based on\nhistorical data to help clinicians recommend the best reference option for\nreal-time treatment. Our model combines offline reinforcement learning with\ndeep reinforcement learning to address the problem that traditional\nreinforcement learning in healthcare cannot interact with the environment,\nenabling our model to make decisions in a continuous state-action space. We\ndemonstrate that, on average, the treatments recommended by the model are more\nvaluable and reliable than those recommended by clinicians. In a large\nvalidation dataset, we found that patients whose actual doses from clinicians\nmatched the AI's decisions had the lowest mortality rates. Our model provides\npersonalized, clinically interpretable treatment decisions for sepsis that can\nimprove patient care.",

    "abstract": "Many past works aim to improve visual reasoning in models by supervising\nfeature importance (estimated by model explanation techniques) with human\nannotations such as highlights of important image regions. However, recent work\nhas shown that performance gains from feature importance (FI) supervision for\nVisual Question Answering (VQA) tasks persist even with random supervision,\nsuggesting that these methods do not meaningfully align model FI with human FI.\nIn this paper, we show that model FI supervision can meaningfully improve VQA\nmodel accuracy as well as performance on several Right-for-the-Right-Reason\n(RRR) metrics by optimizing for four key model objectives: (1) accurate\npredictions given limited but sufficient information (Sufficiency); (2)\nmax-entropy predictions given no important information (Uncertainty); (3)\ninvariance of predictions to changes in unimportant features (Invariance); and\n(4) alignment between model FI explanations and human FI explanations\n(Plausibility). Our best performing method, Visual Feature Importance\nSupervision (VisFIS), outperforms strong baselines on benchmark VQA datasets in\nterms of both in-distribution and out-of-distribution accuracy. While past work\nsuggests that the mechanism for improved accuracy is through improved\nexplanation plausibility, we show that this relationship depends crucially on\nexplanation faithfulness (whether explanations truly represent the model's\ninternal reasoning). Predictions are more accurate when explanations are\nplausible and faithful, and not when they are plausible but not faithful.\nLastly, we show that, surprisingly, RRR metrics are not predictive of\nout-of-distribution model accuracy when controlling for a model's\nin-distribution accuracy, which calls into question the value of these metrics\nfor evaluating model reasoning.

    "abstract": "We consider an object pose estimation and model fitting problem, where -\ngiven a partial point cloud of an object - the goal is to estimate the object\npose by fitting a CAD model to the sensor data. We solve this problem by\ncombining (i) a semantic keypoint-based pose estimation model, (ii) a novel\nself-supervised training approach, and (iii) a certification procedure, that\nnot only verifies whether the output produced by the model is correct or not,\nbut also flags uniqueness of the produced solution. The semantic keypoint\ndetector model is initially trained in simulation and does not perform well on\nreal-data due to the domain gap. Our self-supervised training procedure uses a\ncorrector and a certification module to improve the detector. The corrector\nmodule corrects the detected keypoints to compensate for the domain gap, and is\nimplemented as a declarative layer, for which we develop a simple\ndifferentiation rule. The certification module declares whether the corrected\noutput produced by the model is certifiable (i.e. correct) or not. At each\niteration, the approach optimizes over the loss induced only by the certifiable\ninput-output pairs. As training progresses, we see that the fraction of outputs\nthat are certifiable increases, eventually reaching near $100\\%$ in many cases.\nWe also introduce the notion of strong certifiability wherein the model can\ndetermine if the predicted object model fit is unique or not. The detected\nsemantic keypoints help us implement this in the forward pass. We conduct\nextensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the corrector, the\ncertification, and the proposed self-supervised training using the ShapeNet and\nYCB datasets, and show the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to\nfully supervised baselines while not requiring pose or keypoint supervision on\nreal data.",

    "abstract": "Utterance rewriting aims to recover coreferences and omitted information from\nthe latest turn of a multi-turn dialogue. Recently, methods that tag rather\nthan linearly generate sequences have proven stronger in both in- and\nout-of-domain rewriting settings. This is due to a tagger's smaller search\nspace as it can only copy tokens from the dialogue context. However, these\nmethods may suffer from low coverage when phrases that must be added to a\nsource utterance cannot be covered by a single context span. This can occur in\nlanguages like English that introduce tokens such as prepositions into the\nrewrite for grammaticality. We propose a hierarchical context tagger (HCT) that\nmitigates this issue by predicting slotted rules (e.g., \"besides _\") whose\nslots are later filled with context spans. HCT (i) tags the source string with\ntoken-level edit actions and slotted rules and (ii) fills in the resulting rule\nslots with spans from the dialogue context. This rule tagging allows HCT to add\nout-of-context tokens and multiple spans at once; we further cluster the rules\nto truncate the long tail of the rule distribution. Experiments on several\nbenchmarks show that HCT can outperform state-of-the-art rewriting systems by\n~2 BLEU points.",

The navigation path represents a per-robot\nsequence of views stored in the ledger.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework for glass surface detection by\nincorporating RGB-D information, with two novel modules: (1) a cross-modal\ncontext mining (CCM) module to adaptively learn individual and mutual context\nfeatures from RGB and depth information, and (2) a depth-missing aware\nattention (DAA) module to explicitly exploit spatial locations where missing\ndepths occur to help detect the presence of glass surfaces. In addition, we\npropose a large-scale RGB-D glass surface detection dataset, called\n\\textit{RGB-D GSD}, for RGB-D glass surface detection. Our dataset comprises\n3,009 real-world RGB-D glass surface images with precise annotations. Extensive\nexperimental results show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "While behavior learning has made impressive progress in recent times, it lags\nbehind computer vision and natural language processing due to its inability to\nleverage large, human-generated datasets. Human behaviors have wide variance,\nmultiple modes, and human demonstrations typically do not come with reward\nlabels. These properties limit the applicability of current methods in Offline\nRL and Behavioral Cloning to learn from large, pre-collected datasets. In this\nwork, we present Behavior Transformer (BeT), a new technique to model unlabeled\ndemonstration data with multiple modes. BeT retrofits standard transformer\narchitectures with action discretization coupled with a multi-task action\ncorrection inspired by offset prediction in object detection. This allows us to\nleverage the multi-modal modeling ability of modern transformers to predict\nmulti-modal continuous actions. We experimentally evaluate BeT on a variety of\nrobotic manipulation and self-driving behavior datasets. We show that BeT\nsignificantly improves over prior state-of-the-art work on solving demonstrated\ntasks while capturing the major modes present in the pre-collected datasets.\nFinally, through an extensive ablation study, we analyze the importance of\nevery crucial component in BeT.

In this\npaper, we demonstrate that a learned discrete codebook prior in a small proxy\nspace largely reduces the uncertainty and ambiguity of restoration mapping by\ncasting blind face restoration as a code prediction task, while providing rich\nvisual atoms for generating high-quality faces. Under this paradigm, we propose\na Transformer-based prediction network, named CodeFormer, to model global\ncomposition and context of the low-quality faces for code prediction, enabling\nthe discovery of natural faces that closely approximate the target faces even\nwhen the inputs are severely degraded. To enhance the adaptiveness for\ndifferent degradation, we also propose a controllable feature transformation\nmodule that allows a flexible trade-off between fidelity and quality. Thanks to\nthe expressive codebook prior and global modeling, CodeFormer outperforms state\nof the arts in both quality and fidelity, showing superior robustness to\ndegradation.

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning-based image compression has made signifcant\nprogresses, and has achieved better ratedistortion (R-D) performance than the\nlatest traditional method, H.266/VVC, in both subjective metric and the more\nchallenging objective metric. However, a major problem is that many leading\nlearned schemes cannot maintain a good trade-off between performance and\ncomplexity. In this paper, we propose an effcient and effective image coding\nframework, which achieves similar R-D performance with lower complexity than\nthe state of the art. First, we develop an improved multi-scale residual block\n(MSRB) that can expand the receptive feld and is easier to obtain global\ninformation. It can further capture and reduce the spatial correlation of the\nlatent representations. Second, a more advanced importance map network is\nintroduced to adaptively allocate bits to different regions of the image.\nThird, we apply a 2D post-quantization flter (PQF) to reduce the quantization\nerror, motivated by the Sample Adaptive Offset (SAO) flter in video coding.\nMoreover, We fnd that the complexity of encoder and decoder have different\neffects on image compression performance. Based on this observation, we design\nan asymmetric paradigm, in which the encoder employs three stages of MSRBs to\nimprove the learning capacity, whereas the decoder only needs one stage of MSRB\nto yield satisfactory reconstruction, thereby reducing the decoding complexity\nwithout sacrifcing performance. Experimental results show that compared to the\nstate-of-the-art method, the encoding and decoding time of the proposed method\nare about 17 times faster, and the R-D performance is only reduced by less than\n1% on both Kodak and Tecnick datasets, which is still better than\nH.266/VVC(4:4:4) and other recent learning-based methods.

    "abstract": "Objective: Electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) are two\nnon-invasive bio-signals, which are widely used in human machine interface\n(HMI) technologies (EEG-HMI and EMG-HMI paradigm) for the rehabilitation of\nphysically disabled people. Successful decoding of EEG and EMG signals into\nrespective control command is a pivotal step in the rehabilitation process.\nRecently, several Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based architectures are\nproposed that directly map the raw time-series signal into decision space and\nthe process of meaningful features extraction and classification are performed\nsimultaneously. However, these networks are tailored to the learn the expected\ncharacteristics of the given bio-signal and are limited to single paradigm. In\nthis work, we addressed the question that can we build a single architecture\nwhich is able to learn distinct features from different HMI paradigms and still\nsuccessfully classify them. Approach: In this work, we introduce a single\nhybrid model called ConTraNet, which is based on CNN and Transformer\narchitectures that is equally useful for EEG-HMI and EMG-HMI paradigms.\nConTraNet uses CNN block to introduce inductive bias in the model and learn\nlocal dependencies, whereas the Transformer block uses the self-attention\nmechanism to learn the long-range dependencies in the signal, which are crucial\nfor the classification of EEG and EMG signals. Main results: We evaluated and\ncompared the ConTraNet with state-of-the-art methods on three publicly\navailable datasets which belong to EEG-HMI and EMG-HMI paradigms. ConTraNet\noutperformed its counterparts in all the different category tasks (2-class,\n3-class, 4-class, and 10-class decoding tasks). Significance: The results\nsuggest that ConTraNet is robust to learn distinct features from different HMI\nparadigms and generalizes well as compared to the current state of the art\nalgorithms.",

Grid data from\nphasor measurement units or smart meters can be collected either passively in\nthe traditional way, or actively, upon actuating grid resources and measuring\nthe feeder's voltage response. Analytical claims on feeder identifiability and\ndetectability are reviewed under disparate meter placement scenarios.

    "abstract": "Although RF fingerprinting is one of the most commonly used techniques for\nlocalization, deploying it in a ubiquitous manner requires addressing the\nchallenge of supporting a large number of heterogeneous devices and their\nvariations. We present QHFP, a device-independent quantum fingerprint matching\nalgorithm that addresses two of the issues for realizing worldwide ubiquitous\nlarge-scale location tracking systems: storage space and running time as well\nas devices heterogeneity. In particular, we present a quantum algorithm with a\ncomplexity that is exponentially better than the classical techniques, both in\nspace and running time. QHFP also has provisions for handling the inherent\nlocalization error due to building the large-scale fingerprint using\nheterogeneous devices. We give the details of the entire system starting from\nextracting device-independent features from the raw RSS, mapping the classical\nfeature vectors to their quantum counterparts, and showing a quantum cosine\nsimilarity algorithm for fingerprint matching.\nWe have implemented our quantum algorithm and deployed it in a real testbed\nusing the IBM Quantum machine simulator. Results confirm the ability of QHFP to\nobtain the correct estimated location with an exponential improvement in space\nand running time compared to the traditional classical counterparts. In\naddition, the proposed device-independent features lead to more than 20% better\naccuracy in median error. This highlights the promise of our algorithm for\nfuture ubiquitous large-scale worldwide device-independent fingerprinting\nlocalization systems.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To compare artificial intelligence (AI) as a second reader in\ndetecting lung nodules on chest X-rays (CXR) versus radiologists of two\nbinational institutions, and to evaluate AI performance when using two\ndifferent modes: automated versus assisted (additional remote radiologist\nreview).\nMethods: The CXR public database (n = 247) of the Japanese Society of\nRadiological Technology with various types and sizes of lung nodules was\nanalyzed. Eight radiologists evaluated the CXR images with regard to the\npresence of lung nodules and nodule conspicuity. After radiologist review, the\nAI software processed and flagged the CXR with the highest probability of\nmissed nodules. The calculated accuracy metrics were the area under the curve\n(AUC), sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, false negative case number (FN), and\nthe effect of different AI modes (automated/assisted) on the accuracy of nodule\ndetection.\nResults: For radiologists, the average AUC value was 0.77 $\\pm$ 0.07, while\nthe average FN was 52.63 $\\pm$ 17.53 (all studies) and 32 $\\pm$ 11.59 (studies\ncontaining a nodule of malignant etiology = 32% rate of missed malignant\nnodules). Both AI modes -- automated and assisted -- produced an average\nincrease in sensitivity (by 14% and 12%) and of F1-score (5% and 6%) and a\ndecrease in specificity (by 10% and 3%, respectively).\nConclusions: Both AI modes flagged the pulmonary nodules missed by\nradiologists in a significant number of cases. AI as a second reader has a high\npotential to improve diagnostic accuracy and radiology workflow. AI might\ndetect certain pulmonary nodules earlier than radiologists, with a potentially\nsignificant impact on patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Speech enhancement has seen great improvement in recent years using\nend-to-end neural networks. However, most models are agnostic to the spoken\nphonetic content. Recently, several studies suggested phonetic-aware speech\nenhancement, mostly using perceptual supervision. Yet, injecting phonetic\nfeatures during model optimization can take additional forms (e.g., model\nconditioning). In this paper, we conduct a systematic comparison between\ndifferent methods of incorporating phonetic information in a speech enhancement\nmodel. By conducting a series of controlled experiments, we observe the\ninfluence of different phonetic content models as well as various\nfeature-injection techniques on enhancement performance, considering both\ncausal and non-causal models. Specifically, we evaluate three settings for\ninjecting phonetic information, namely: i) feature conditioning; ii) perceptual\nsupervision; and iii) regularization. Phonetic features are obtained using an\nintermediate layer of either a supervised pre-trained Automatic Speech\nRecognition (ASR) model or by using a pre-trained Self-Supervised Learning\n(SSL) model. We further observe the effect of choosing different embedding\nlayers on performance, considering both manual and learned configurations.\nResults suggest that using a SSL model as phonetic features outperforms the ASR\none in most cases. Interestingly, the conditioning setting performs best among\nthe evaluated configurations.",

    "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Turbulence Modeling in Large Eddy  Simulations",
    "abstract": "Over the last years, supervised learning (SL) has established itself as the\nstate-of-the-art for data-driven turbulence modeling. In the SL paradigm,\nmodels are trained based on a dataset, which is typically computed a priori\nfrom a high-fidelity solution by applying the respective filter function, which\nseparates the resolved and the unresolved flow scales. For implicitly filtered\nlarge eddy simulation (LES), this approach is infeasible, since here, the\nemployed discretization itself acts as an implicit filter function. As a\nconsequence, the exact filter form is generally not known and thus, the\ncorresponding closure terms cannot be computed even if the full solution is\navailable. The reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can be used to avoid this\ninconsistency by training not on a previously obtained training dataset, but\ninstead by interacting directly with the dynamical LES environment itself. This\nallows to incorporate the potentially complex implicit LES filter into the\ntraining process by design. In this work, we apply a reinforcement learning\nframework to find an optimal eddy-viscosity for implicitly filtered large eddy\nsimulations of forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence. For this, we formulate\nthe task of turbulence modeling as an RL task with a policy network based on\nconvolutional neural networks that adapts the eddy-viscosity in LES dynamically\nin space and time based on the local flow state only. We demonstrate that the\ntrained models can provide long-term stable simulations and that they\noutperform established analytical models in terms of accuracy. In addition, the\nmodels generalize well to other resolutions and discretizations. We thus\ndemonstrate that RL can provide a framework for consistent, accurate and stable\nturbulence modeling especially for implicitly filtered LES.",

    "title": "CNN-based fully automatic wrist cartilage volume quantification in MR  Image",
    "abstract": "Detection of cartilage loss is crucial for the diagnosis of osteo- and\nrheumatoid arthritis. A large number of automatic segmentation tools have been\nreported so far for cartilage assessment in magnetic resonance images of large\njoints. As compared to knee or hip, wrist cartilage has a more complex\nstructure so that automatic tools developed for large joints are not expected\nto be operational for wrist cartilage segmentation. In that respect, a fully\nautomatic wrist cartilage segmentation method would be of high clinical\ninterest. We assessed the performance of four optimized variants of the U-Net\narchitecture with truncation of its depth and addition of attention layers\n(U-Net_AL). The corresponding results were compared to those from a patch-based\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) we previously designed. The segmentation\nquality was assessed on the basis of a comparative analysis with manual\nsegmentation using several morphological (2D DSC, 3D DSC, precision) and a\nvolumetric metrics. The four networks outperformed the patch-based CNN in terms\nof segmentation homogeneity and quality. The median 3D DSC value computed with\nthe U-Net_AL (0.817) was significantly larger than the corresponding DSC values\ncomputed with the other networks. In addition, the U-Net_AL CNN provided the\nlowest mean volume error (17%) and the highest Pearson correlation coefficient\n(0.765) with respect to the ground truth. Of interest, the reproducibility\ncomputed from using U-Net_AL was larger than the reproducibility of the manual\nsegmentation. U-net convolutional neural network with additional attention\nlayers provides the best wrist cartilage segmentation performance. In order to\nbe used in clinical conditions, the trained network can be fine-tuned on a\ndataset representing a group of specific patients. The error of cartilage\nvolume measurement should be assessed independently using a non-MRI method.",

Polyhedral Lyapunov functions provide an\nalternative to commonly used polynomial Lyapunov functions. Our approach first\ncharacterizes intrinsic properties of a polyhedral Lyapunov function including\nits \"eccentricity\" and \"robustness\" to perturbations. We then derive an\nalgorithm that either computes a polyhedral Lyapunov function proving that the\nsystem is stable, or concludes that no polyhedral Lyapunov function exists\nwhose eccentricity and robustness parameters satisfy some user-provided limits.\nSignificantly, our approach places no a priori bounds on the number of linear\npieces that make up the desired polyhedral Lyapunov function.\nThe algorithm alternates between a learning step and a verification step,\nalways maintaining a finite set of witness states. The learning step solves a\nlinear program to compute a candidate Lyapunov function compatible with a\nfinite set of witness states. In the verification step, our approach verifies\nwhether the candidate Lyapunov function is a valid Lyapunov function for the\nsystem. If verification fails, we obtain a new witness. We prove a theoretical\nbound on the maximum number of iterations needed by our algorithm. We\ndemonstrate the applicability of the algorithm on numerical examples.",

    "abstract": "We consider frugal splitting operators for finite sum monotone inclusion\nproblems, i.e., splitting operators that use exactly one direct or resolvent\nevaluation of each operator of the sum. A novel representation of these\noperators in terms of what we call a generalized primal-dual resolvent is\npresented. This representation reveals a number of new results regarding\nlifting numbers, existence of solution maps, and parallelizability of the\nforward/backward evaluations. We show that the minimal lifting is $n-1-f$ where\n$n$ is the number of monotone operators and $f$ is the number of direct\nevaluations in the splitting. Furthermore, we show that this lifting number is\nonly achievable as long as the first and last evaluation are resolvent\nevaluations. In the case of frugal resolvent splitting operators, these results\nrecovers the results of Ryu and Malitsky--Tam. The representation also enables\na unified convergence analysis and we present a generally applicable theorem\nfor the convergence and Fej\\'er monotonicity of fixed point iterations of\nfrugal splitting operators with cocoercive direct evaluations. We conclude by\nconstructing a new convergent and parallelizable frugal splitting operator with\nminimal lifting.",

    "abstract": "Employing deep neural networks (DNNs) to directly learn filters for\nmulti-channel speech enhancement has potentially two key advantages over a\ntraditional approach combining a linear spatial filter with an independent\ntempo-spectral post-filter: 1) non-linear spatial filtering allows to overcome\npotential restrictions originating from a linear processing model and 2) joint\nprocessing of spatial and tempo-spectral information allows to exploit\ninterdependencies between different sources of information. A variety of\nDNN-based non-linear filters have been proposed recently, for which good\nenhancement performance is reported. However, little is known about the\ninternal mechanisms which turns network architecture design into a game of\nchance. Therefore, in this paper, we perform experiments to better understand\nthe internal processing of spatial, spectral and temporal information by\nDNN-based non-linear filters. On the one hand, our experiments in a difficult\nspeech extraction scenario confirm the importance of non-linear spatial\nfiltering, which outperforms an oracle linear spatial filter by 0.24 POLQA\nscore. On the other hand, we demonstrate that joint processing results in a\nlarge performance gap of 0.4 POLQA score between network architectures\nexploiting spectral versus temporal information besides spatial information.",

    "abstract": "As customer demands become increasingly diverse, the colors and styles of\nvehicles offered by automotive companies have also grown substantially. It\nposes great challenges to design and management of automotive manufacturing\nsystem, among which is the proper sequencing of vehicles in everyday operation\nof the paint shop. With typically hundreds of vehicles in one shift, the paint\nshop sequencing problem is intractable in classical computing. In this paper,\nwe propose to solve a general paint shop sequencing problem using\nstate-of-the-art quantum computing algorithms. Most existing works are solely\nfocused on reducing color changeover costs, i.e., costs incurred by different\ncolors between consecutive vehicles. This work reveals that different\nsequencing of vehicles also significantly affects the quality performance of\nthe painting process. We use a machine learning model pretrained on historical\ndata to predict the probability of painting defect. The problem is formulated\nas a combinational optimization problem with two cost components, i.e., color\nchangeover cost and repair cost. The problem is further converted to a quantum\noptimization problem and solved with Quantum Approximation Optimization\nAlgorithm (QAOA). As a matter of fact, current quantum computers are still\nlimited in accuracy and scalability. However, with a simplified case study, we\ndemonstrate how the classic sequencing problem in paint shop can be formulated\nand solved using quantum computing and demonstrate the potential of quantum\ncomputing in solving real problems in manufacturing systems.",

Whereas SDL quickly\noverfit the training data, DRL learned in a progressive manner that generalised\nto the separate testing set.\nConclusion : DRL can learn to classify ASD versus NT in a data efficient\nmanner, doing so for a small training set.

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a brain condition characterized by diverse\nsigns and symptoms that appear in early childhood. ASD is also associated with\ncommunication deficits and repetitive behavior in affected individuals. Various\nASD detection methods have been developed, including neuroimaging modalities\nand psychological tests. Among these methods, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nimaging modalities are of paramount importance to physicians. Clinicians rely\non MRI modalities to diagnose ASD accurately. The MRI modalities are\nnon-invasive methods that include functional (fMRI) and structural (sMRI)\nneuroimaging methods. However, the process of diagnosing ASD with fMRI and sMRI\nfor specialists is often laborious and time-consuming; therefore, several\ncomputer-aided design systems (CADS) based on artificial intelligence (AI) have\nbeen developed to assist the specialist physicians. Conventional machine\nlearning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are the most popular schemes of AI used\nfor diagnosing ASD. This study aims to review the automated detection of ASD\nusing AI. We review several CADS that have been developed using ML techniques\nfor the automated diagnosis of ASD using MRI modalities. There has been very\nlimited work on the use of DL techniques to develop automated diagnostic models\nfor ASD. A summary of the studies developed using DL is provided in the\nappendix. Then, the challenges encountered during the automated diagnosis of\nASD using MRI and AI techniques are described in detail. Additionally, a\ngraphical comparison of studies using ML and DL to diagnose ASD automatically\nis discussed. We conclude by suggesting future approaches to detecting ASDs\nusing AI techniques and MRI neuroimaging.",
