    "abstract": "Attempting to fully exploit the rich information of topological structure and\nnode features for attributed graph, we introduce self-supervised learning\nmechanism to graph representation learning and propose a novel Self-supervised\nConsensus Representation Learning (SCRL) framework. In contrast to most\nexisting works that only explore one graph, our proposed SCRL method treats\ngraph from two perspectives: topology graph and feature graph. We argue that\ntheir embeddings should share some common information, which could serve as a\nsupervisory signal. Specifically, we construct the feature graph of node\nfeatures via k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Then graph convolutional network\n(GCN) encoders extract features from two graphs respectively. Self-supervised\nloss is designed to maximize the agreement of the embeddings of the same node\nin the topology graph and the feature graph. Extensive experiments on real\ncitation networks and social networks demonstrate the superiority of our\nproposed SCRL over the state-of-the-art methods on semi-supervised node\nclassification task. Meanwhile, compared with its main competitors, SCRL is\nrather efficient.",

Therefore, this survey\nprovides a categorization of how recent interpretability methods communicate\nexplanations and discusses the methods in depth. Furthermore, the survey\nfocuses on post-hoc methods, which provide explanations after a model is\nlearned and generally model-agnostic.

Two RL methods are tested: a roll-out\nQ-learning, which may be considered as MPC with terminal cost being a\nQ-function approximation, and a so-called stacked Q-learning, which in turn is\nlike MPC with the running cost substituted for a Q-function approximation. The\nexperimental foundation is a mobile robot with a differential drive (Robotis\nTurtlebot3). Experimental results showed that both RL methods beat the baseline\nin terms of the accumulated cost, whereas the stacked variant performed best.\nProvided the series of previous works on stacked Q-learning, this particular\nstudy supports the idea that MPC with a running cost adaptation inspired by\nQ-learning possesses potential of performance boost while retaining the nice\nproperties of MPC.",

Using the Facebook Blood\nDonation tool, we conduct the first large-scale algorithmic matching of blood\ndonors with donation opportunities. While measuring actual donation rates\nremains a challenge, we measure donor action (e.g., making a donation\nappointment) as a proxy for actual donation. We develop automated policies for\nmatching patients and donors, based on an online matching model. We provide\ntheoretical guarantees for these policies, both regarding the number of\nexpected donations and the equitable treatment of blood recipients. In\nsimulations, a simple matching strategy increases the number of donations by\n5-10%; a pilot experiment with real donors shows a 5% relative increase in\ndonor action rate (from 3.7% to 3.9%). When scaled to the global Blood Donation\ntool user base, this corresponds to an increase of around one hundred thousand\nusers taking action toward donation. Further, observing donor action on a\nsocial network can shed light onto donor behavior and response to incentives.\nOur initial findings align with several observations made in the medical and\nsocial science literature regarding donor behavior.",

    "abstract": "Perceiving obstacles and avoiding collisions is fundamental to the safe\noperation of a robot system, particularly when the robot must operate in highly\ndynamic human environments. Proximity detection using on-robot sensors can be\nused to avoid or mitigate impending collisions. However, existing proximity\nsensing methods are orientation and placement dependent, resulting in blind\nspots even with large numbers of sensors. In this paper, we introduce the\nphenomenon of the Leaky Surface Wave (LSW), a novel sensing modality, and\npresent AuraSense, a proximity detection system using the LSW. AuraSense is the\nfirst system to realize no-dead-spot proximity sensing for robot arms. It\nrequires only a single pair of piezoelectric transducers, and can easily be\napplied to off-the-shelf robots with minimal modifications. We further\nintroduce a set of signal processing techniques and a lightweight neural\nnetwork to address the unique challenges in using the LSW for proximity\nsensing. Finally, we demonstrate a prototype system consisting of a single\npiezoelectric element pair on a robot manipulator, which validates our design.\nWe conducted several micro benchmark experiments and performed more than 2000\non-robot proximity detection trials with various potential robot arm materials,\ncolliding objects, approach patterns, and robot movement patterns.

However, studies have shown the potential of pruning as\na form of regularization, which reduces overfitting and improves\ngeneralization. We demonstrate that this family of strategies provides\nadditional benefits beyond computational performance and generalization. Our\nanalyses reveal that pruning structures (filters and/or layers) from\nconvolutional networks increase not only generalization but also robustness to\nadversarial images (natural images with content modified). Such achievements\nare possible since pruning reduces network capacity and provides\nregularization, which have been proven effective tools against adversarial\nimages. In contrast to promising defense mechanisms that require training with\nadversarial images and careful regularization, we show that pruning obtains\ncompetitive results considering only natural images (e.g., the standard and\nlow-cost training). We confirm these findings on several adversarial attacks\nand architectures; thus suggesting the potential of pruning as a novel defense\nmechanism against adversarial images.",

It can be extended to attack sequential logic encryption\ntechniques by leveraging circuit unrolling and model checking methods. However,\nwith no guidance on the number of times that a circuit needs to be unrolled to\nfind the correct key, the attack tends to solve many time-consuming Boolean\nsatisfiability (SAT) and model checking problems, which can significantly\nhamper its efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Fun-SAT, a functional\ncorruptibility-guided SAT-based attack that can significantly decrease the SAT\nsolving and model checking time of a SAT-based attack on sequential encryption\nby efficiently estimating the minimum required number of circuit unrollings.\nFun-SAT relies on a notion of functional corruptibility for encrypted\nsequential circuits and its relationship with the required number of circuit\nunrollings in a SAT-based attack. Numerical results show that Fun-SAT can be,\non average, 90x faster than previous attacks against state-of-the-art\nencryption methods, when both attacks successfully complete before a one-day\ntime-out.

In a multidimensional model, a subset of attributes\ncalled the quasi-identifiers (QI) are used to define the space and a\ngeneralization scheme corresponds to a partitioning of the data space. The\nprocess of sanitization can be modeled as a constrained optimization problem\nwhere the information loss metric is to be minimized while ensuring that the\nprivacy criteria are enforced. The privacy requirements translate into\nconstraints on the partitions (bins), like minimum occupancy constraints for\nk-anonymity, value diversity constraint for l-diversity etc. Most algorithms\nproposed till date use some greedy search heuristic to search for a locally\noptimal generalization scheme. The performance of such algorithms degrade\nrapidly as the constraints are made more complex and numerous. To address this\nissue, in this paper we develop a complete enumeration based systematic search\nframework that searches for the globally optimal generalization scheme amongst\nall feasible candidates. We employ a novel enumeration technique that\neliminates duplicates and develop effective pruning heuristics that cut down\nthe solution space in order to make the search tractable. Our scheme is\nversatile enough to accommodate multiple constraints and information loss\nfunctions satisfying a set of generic properties (that are usually satisfied by\nmost metrics proposed in literature). Additionally, our approach allows the\nuser to specify various stopping criteria and can give a bound on the\napproximation factor achieved by any candidate solution.

    "abstract": "A new gradient-based formulation for predicting fracture in elastic-plastic\nsolids is presented. Damage is captured by means of a phase field model that\nconsiders both the elastic and plastic works as driving forces for fracture.\nMaterial deformation is characterised by a mechanism-based strain gradient\nconstitutive model. This non-local plastic-damage formulation is numerically\nimplemented and used to simulate fracture in several paradigmatic boundary\nvalue problems. The case studies aim at shedding light into the role of the\nplastic and fracture length scales. It is found that the role of plastic strain\ngradients is two-fold. When dealing with sharp defects like cracks, plastic\nstrain gradients elevate local stresses and facilitate fracture. However, in\nthe presence of non-sharp defects failure is driven by the localisation of\nplastic flow, which is delayed due to the additional work hardening introduced\nby plastic strain gradients.",

Recent advances in volumetric neural rendering, such as neural\nradiance fields (NeRF), has enabled the photorealistic novel view synthesis of\nstatic scenes with impressive results. However, modeling dynamic and\ncontrollable objects as part of a scene with such scene representations is\nstill challenging. In this work, we design a system that enables both novel\nview synthesis for portrait video, including the human subject and the scene\nbackground, and explicit control of the facial expressions through a\nlow-dimensional expression representation. We leverage the expression space of\na 3D morphable face model (3DMM) to represent the distribution of human facial\nexpressions, and use it to condition the NeRF volumetric function. Furthermore,\nwe impose a spatial prior brought by 3DMM fitting to guide the network to learn\ndisentangled control for scene appearance and facial actions. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our method on free view synthesis of portrait videos with\nexpression controls. To train a scene, our method only requires a short video\nof a subject captured by a mobile device.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven decision making has been a common task in today's big data era,\nfrom simple choices such as finding a fast way for driving to work, to complex\ndecisions on cancer treatment in healthcare, often supported by visual\nanalytics. For various reasons (e.g., an ill-defined problem space, network\nfailures or bias), visual analytics for sensemaking of data involves\nmissingness (e.g., missing data and incomplete analysis), which can impact\nhuman decisions. For example, data, with missing records, can cost a business\nmillions of dollars, and failing to recognize key evidence can put an innocent\nperson into a sentence to death as a falsely convicted of murder. Being aware\nof missingness is critical to avoid such catastrophes. To achieve this, as an\ninitial step, we present a framework of categorizing missingness in visual\nanalytics from two perspectives: data-centric and human-centric. The former\nemphasizes missingness in three data-related categories: data composition, data\nrelationship and data usage. The latter focuses on the human-perceived\nmissingness at three levels: observed missingness, inferred missingness and\nignored missingness. Based on the framework, we discuss possible roles of\nvisualizations for handling missingness, and conclude our discussion with\nfuture research opportunities.",

Based\non the concept of independent component analysis (ICA), this paper proposes an\nextended framework in which the mutual information among the noises is\nminimized. Another significant contribution is to reduce the realization of the\nshortest path problem. The distance between each pair of nodes expresses an\nassociated mutual information value, and the path with the minimum sum (KL\ndivergence) is sought. Although $p!$ mutual information values should be\ncompared, this paper dramatically reduces the computation when no confounding\nis present. The proposed algorithm finds the globally optimal solution, while\nthe existing locally greedily seek the order based on hypothesis testing. We\nuse the best estimator in the sense of Bayes/MDL that correctly detects\nindependence for mutual information estimation.

In clinical research studies, especially comparative\neffectiveness studies, failure to adjust for SBDoH factors will potentially\ncause confounding issues and misclassification errors in either statistical\nanalyses and machine learning-based models. However, there are limited studies\nto examine SBDoH factors in clinical outcomes due to the lack of structured\nSBDoH information in current electronic health record (EHR) systems, while much\nof the SBDoH information is documented in clinical narratives. Natural language\nprocessing (NLP) is thus the key technology to extract such information from\nunstructured clinical text. However, there is not a mature clinical NLP system\nfocusing on SBDoH. In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art\ntransformer-based NLP models, including BERT and RoBERTa, to extract SBDoH\nconcepts from clinical narratives, applied the best performing model to extract\nSBDoH concepts on a lung cancer screening patient cohort, and examined the\ndifference of SBDoH information between NLP extracted results and structured\nEHRs (SBDoH information captured in standard vocabularies such as the\nInternational Classification of Diseases codes).

    "abstract": "Proposed are alternative generator architectures for Boundary Equilibrium\nGenerative Adversarial Networks, motivated by Learning from Simulated and\nUnsupervised Images through Adversarial Training. It disentangles the need for\na noise-based latent space. The generator will operate mainly as a refiner\nnetwork to gain a photo-realistic presentation of the given synthetic images.\nIt also attempts to resolve the latent space's poorly understood properties by\neliminating the need for noise injection and replacing it with an image-based\nconcept. The new flexible and simple generator architecture will also give the\npower to control the trade-off between restrictive refinement and\nexpressiveness ability. Contrary to other available methods, this architecture\nwill not require a paired or unpaired dataset of real and synthetic images for\nthe training phase. Only a relatively small set of real images would suffice.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have improved the state-of-the-art across numerous tasks in\nsequence modeling. Besides the quadratic computational and memory complexity\nw.r.t the sequence length, the self-attention mechanism only processes\ninformation at the same scale, i.e., all attention heads are in the same\nresolution, resulting in the limited power of the Transformer. To remedy this,\nwe propose a novel and efficient structure named Adaptive Multi-Resolution\nAttention (AdaMRA for short), which scales linearly to sequence length in terms\nof time and space. Specifically, we leverage a multi-resolution multi-head\nattention mechanism, enabling attention heads to capture long-range contextual\ninformation in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Moreover, to capture the potential\nrelations between query representation and clues of different attention\ngranularities, we leave the decision of which resolution of attention to use to\nquery, which further improves the model's capacity compared to vanilla\nTransformer. In an effort to reduce complexity, we adopt kernel attention\nwithout degrading the performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model by achieving a\nstate-of-the-art performance-efficiency-memory trade-off. To facilitate AdaMRA\nutilization by the scientific community, the code implementation will be made\npublicly available.",

    "abstract": "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive and fatal\nneurodegenerative disease, that causes approximately 350 deaths in the United\nStates every year. In specific, it is a prion disease that is caused by a\nmisfolded prion protein, termed $PrP^{Sc}$, which is the infectious form of the\nprion protein $PrP^{C}$. Rather than being recycled by the body, the $PrP^{Sc}$\naggregates in the brain as plaques, leading to neurodegeneration of surrounding\ncells and the spongiform characteristics of the pathology. However, there has\nbeen very little research done into factors that can affect one's chances of\nacquiring $PrP^{Sc}$. In this paper, Elastic Net Regression, Long Short-Term\nMemory Recurrent Neural Network Architectures, and Random Forest have been used\nto predict Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Levels in the United States. New variables\nwere created as data for the models to use on the basis of common factors that\nare known to affect CJD, such as soil, food, and water quality. Based on the\nroot mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), and mean absolute error\n(MAE) values, the study reveals the high impact of unhealthy lifestyle choices,\nCO$_{2}$ Levels, Pesticide Usage, and Potash K$_{2}$O Usage on CJD Levels.

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Network (DNN) watermarking is a method for provenance\nverification of DNN models. Watermarking should be robust against watermark\nremoval attacks that derive a surrogate model that evades provenance\nverification. Many watermarking schemes that claim robustness have been\nproposed, but their robustness is only validated in isolation against a\nrelatively small set of attacks. There is no systematic, empirical evaluation\nof these claims against a common, comprehensive set of removal attacks. This\nuncertainty about a watermarking scheme's robustness causes difficulty to trust\ntheir deployment in practice. In this paper, we evaluate whether recently\nproposed watermarking schemes that claim robustness are robust against a large\nset of removal attacks. We survey methods from the literature that (i) are\nknown removal attacks, (ii) derive surrogate models but have not been evaluated\nas removal attacks, and (iii) novel removal attacks. Weight shifting and smooth\nretraining are novel removal attacks adapted to the DNN watermarking schemes\nsurveyed in this paper. We propose taxonomies for watermarking schemes and\nremoval attacks. Our empirical evaluation includes an ablation study over sets\nof parameters for each attack and watermarking scheme on the CIFAR-10 and\nImageNet datasets. Surprisingly, none of the surveyed watermarking schemes is\nrobust in practice. We find that schemes fail to withstand adaptive attacks and\nknown methods for deriving surrogate models that have not been evaluated as\nremoval attacks. This points to intrinsic flaws in how robustness is currently\nevaluated. We show that watermarking schemes need to be evaluated against a\nmore extensive set of removal attacks with a more realistic adversary model.\nOur source code and a complete dataset of evaluation results are publicly\navailable, which allows to independently verify our conclusions.",

In particular, such attacks cause serious problems in medical\nimaging. Given that computer-based systems are generally operated under a\nblack-box condition in which only queries on inputs are allowed and outputs are\naccessible, the impact of UAPs seems to be limited because well-used algorithms\nfor generating UAPs are limited to a white-box condition in which adversaries\ncan access the model weights and loss gradients. Nevertheless, we demonstrate\nthat UAPs are easily generatable using a relatively small dataset under\nblack-box conditions. In particular, we propose a method for generating UAPs\nusing a simple hill-climbing search based only on DNN outputs and demonstrate\nthe validity of the proposed method using representative DNN-based medical\nimage classifications. Black-box UAPs can be used to conduct both non-targeted\nand targeted attacks. Overall, the black-box UAPs showed high attack success\nrates (40% to 90%), although some of them had relatively low success rates\nbecause the method only utilizes limited information to generate UAPs. The\nvulnerability of black-box UAPs was observed in several model architectures.\nThe results indicate that adversaries can also generate UAPs through a simple\nprocedure under the black-box condition to foil or control DNN-based medical\nimage diagnoses, and that UAPs are a more realistic security threat.",

    "abstract": "Self-assignment, where software developers choose their own tasks, is a\ncommon practice in agile teams. However, it is not known why developers select\ncertain tasks. It is important for managers to be aware of these reasons to\nensure sustainable self-assignment practices. We investigated developers'\npreferences while they are choosing tasks for themselves. We collected data\nfrom 42 participants working in 25 different software companies. We applied\nGrounded Theory procedures to study and analyse factors for self-assigning\ntasks, which we grouped into three categories: task-based, developer-based, and\nopinion-based. We found that developers have individual preferences and not all\nfactors are important to every developer. Managers share some common and\nvarying perspectives around the identified factors. Most managers want\ndevelopers to give higher priority to certain factors. Developers often need to\nbalance between task priority and their own individual preferences, and\nmanagers facilitate this through a variety of strategies. More risk-averse\nmanagers encourage expertise-based self-assignment to ensure tasks are\ncompleted quickly. Managers who are risk-balancing encourage developers to\nchoose tasks that provide learning opportunities only when there is little risk\nof delays or reduced quality. Finally, growth-seeking managers regularly\nencourage team members to pick tasks outside their comfort zone to encourage\ngrowth opportunities. Our findings will help managers to understand what\ndevelopers consider when self-assigning tasks and help them empower their teams\nto practice self-assignment in a sustainable manner.",

    "abstract": "Face recognition (FR) has made extraordinary progress owing to the\nadvancement of deep convolutional neural networks. However, demographic bias\namong different racial cohorts still challenges the practical face recognition\nsystem. The race factor has been proven to be a dilemma for fair FR (FFR) as\nthe subject-related specific attributes induce the classification bias whilst\ncarrying some useful cues for FR. To mitigate racial bias and meantime preserve\nrobust FR, we abstract face identity-related representation as a signal\ndenoising problem and propose a progressive cross transformer (PCT) method for\nfair face recognition. Originating from the signal decomposition theory, we\nattempt to decouple face representation into i) identity-related components and\nii) noisy/identity-unrelated components induced by race. As an extension of\nsignal subspace decomposition, we formulate face decoupling as a generalized\nfunctional expression model to cross-predict face identity and race\ninformation. The face expression model is further concretized by designing dual\ncross-transformers to distill identity-related components and suppress racial\nnoises. In order to refine face representation, we take a progressive face\ndecoupling way to learn identity/race-specific transformations, so that\nidentity-unrelated components induced by race could be better disentangled. We\nevaluate the proposed PCT on the public fair face recognition benchmarks (BFW,\nRFW) and verify that PCT is capable of mitigating bias in face recognition\nwhile achieving state-of-the-art FR performance. Besides, visualization results\nalso show that the attention maps in PCT can well reveal the\nrace-related/biased facial regions.",

Several math symbols are very\nsimilar in the writing style, such as dot and comma or 0, O, and o, which is a\nchallenge for HME recognition systems to handle without using contextual\ninformation. To address this problem, this paper presents a Transformer-based\nMath Language Model (TMLM). Based on the self-attention mechanism, the\nhigh-level representation of an input token in a sequence of tokens is computed\nby how it is related to the previous tokens. Thus, TMLM can capture long\ndependencies and correlations among symbols and relations in a mathematical\nexpression (ME). We trained the proposed language model using a corpus of\napproximately 70,000 LaTeX sequences provided in CROHME 2016. TMLM achieved the\nperplexity of 4.42, which outperformed the previous math language models, i.e.,\nthe N-gram and recurrent neural network-based language models. In addition, we\ncombine TMLM into a stochastic context-free grammar-based HME recognition\nsystem using a weighting parameter to re-rank the top-10 best candidates.

Currently, there are\nonly a few approaches for computing a diverse solution set for the TSP.\nFurthermore, almost all of them assume that the optimal solution is known.

We show how to adopt EAX to not only find a high-quality solution but\nalso to maximise the diversity of the population. The resulting EAX-based EDO\napproach, termed EAX-EDO is capable of obtaining diverse high-quality tours\nwhen the optimal solution for the TSP is known or unknown. A comparison to\nexisting approaches shows that they are clearly outperformed by EAX-EDO.",

    "title": "Robust Feature Learning on Long-Duration Sounds for Acoustic Scene  Classification",
    "abstract": "Acoustic scene classification (ASC) aims to identify the type of scene\n(environment) in which a given audio signal is recorded. The log-mel feature\nand convolutional neural network (CNN) have recently become the most popular\ntime-frequency (TF) feature representation and classifier in ASC. An audio\nsignal recorded in a scene may include various sounds overlapping in time and\nfrequency. The previous study suggests that separately considering the\nlong-duration sounds and short-duration sounds in CNN may improve ASC accuracy.\nThis study addresses the problem of the generalization ability of acoustic\nscene classifiers. In practice, acoustic scene signals' characteristics may be\naffected by various factors, such as the choice of recording devices and the\nchange of recording locations. When an established ASC system predicts scene\nclasses on audios recorded in unseen scenarios, its accuracy may drop\nsignificantly. The long-duration sounds not only contain domain-independent\nacoustic scene information, but also contain channel information determined by\nthe recording conditions, which is prone to over-fitting. For a more robust ASC\nsystem, We propose a robust feature learning (RFL) framework to train the CNN.\nThe RFL framework down-weights CNN learning specifically on long-duration\nsounds. The proposed method is to train an auxiliary classifier with only\nlong-duration sound information as input. The auxiliary classifier is trained\nwith an auxiliary loss function that assigns less learning weight to poorly\nclassified examples than the standard cross-entropy loss. The experimental\nresults show that the proposed RFL framework can obtain a more robust acoustic\nscene classifier towards unseen devices and cities.",

    "title": "Learning Deep Multimodal Feature Representation with Asymmetric  Multi-layer Fusion",
    "abstract": "We propose a compact and effective framework to fuse multimodal features at\nmultiple layers in a single network. The framework consists of two innovative\nfusion schemes. Firstly, unlike existing multimodal methods that necessitate\nindividual encoders for different modalities, we verify that multimodal\nfeatures can be learnt within a shared single network by merely maintaining\nmodality-specific batch normalization layers in the encoder, which also enables\nimplicit fusion via joint feature representation learning. Secondly, we propose\na bidirectional multi-layer fusion scheme, where multimodal features can be\nexploited progressively. To take advantage of such scheme, we introduce two\nasymmetric fusion operations including channel shuffle and pixel shift, which\nlearn different fused features with respect to different fusion directions.\nThese two operations are parameter-free and strengthen the multimodal feature\ninteractions across channels as well as enhance the spatial feature\ndiscrimination within channels. We conduct extensive experiments on semantic\nsegmentation and image translation tasks, based on three publicly available\ndatasets covering diverse modalities. Results indicate that our proposed\nframework is general, compact and is superior to state-of-the-art fusion\nframeworks.",

    "abstract": "Few-shot learning aims to recognize novel classes with few examples.\nPre-training based methods effectively tackle the problem by pre-training a\nfeature extractor and then fine-tuning it through the nearest centroid based\nmeta-learning. However, results show that the fine-tuning step makes marginal\nimprovements. In this paper, 1) we figure out the reason, i.e., in the\npre-trained feature space, the base classes already form compact clusters while\nnovel classes spread as groups with large variances, which implies that\nfine-tuning feature extractor is less meaningful; 2) instead of fine-tuning\nfeature extractor, we focus on estimating more representative prototypes.\nConsequently, we propose a novel prototype completion based meta-learning\nframework. This framework first introduces primitive knowledge (i.e.,\nclass-level part or attribute annotations) and extracts representative features\nfor seen attributes as priors. Second, a part/attribute transfer network is\ndesigned to learn to infer the representative features for unseen attributes as\nsupplementary priors. Finally, a prototype completion network is devised to\nlearn to complete prototypes with these priors. Moreover, to avoid the\nprototype completion error, we further develop a Gaussian based prototype\nfusion strategy that fuses the mean-based and completed prototypes by\nexploiting the unlabeled samples. Extensive experiments show that our method:\n(i) obtains more accurate prototypes; (ii) achieves superior performance on\nboth inductive and transductive FSL settings.",

    "abstract": "Tactile sensing plays an important role in robotic perception and\nmanipulation tasks. To overcome the real-world limitations of data collection,\nsimulating tactile response in a virtual environment comes as a desirable\ndirection of robotic research. In this paper, we propose Elastic Interaction of\nParticles (EIP) for tactile simulation. Most existing works model the tactile\nsensor as a rigid multi-body, which is incapable of reflecting the elastic\nproperty of the tactile sensor as well as characterizing the fine-grained\nphysical interaction between the two objects. By contrast, EIP models the\ntactile sensor as a group of coordinated particles, and the elastic property is\napplied to regulate the deformation of particles during contact. With the\ntactile simulation by EIP, we further propose a tactile-visual perception\nnetwork that enables information fusion between tactile data and visual images.\nThe perception network is based on a global-to-local fusion mechanism where\nmulti-scale tactile features are aggregated to the corresponding local region\nof the visual modality with the guidance of tactile positions and directions.\nThe fusion method exhibits superiority regarding the 3D geometric\nreconstruction task.",

    "abstract": "Different from visible cameras which record intensity images frame by frame,\nthe biologically inspired event camera produces a stream of asynchronous and\nsparse events with much lower latency. In practice, the visible cameras can\nbetter perceive texture details and slow motion, while event cameras can be\nfree from motion blurs and have a larger dynamic range which enables them to\nwork well under fast motion and low illumination. Therefore, the two sensors\ncan cooperate with each other to achieve more reliable object tracking. In this\nwork, we propose a large-scale Visible-Event benchmark (termed VisEvent) due to\nthe lack of a realistic and scaled dataset for this task. Our dataset consists\nof 820 video pairs captured under low illumination, high speed, and background\nclutter scenarios, and it is divided into a training and a testing subset, each\nof which contains 500 and 320 videos, respectively. Based on VisEvent, we\ntransform the event flows into event images and construct more than 30 baseline\nmethods by extending current single-modality trackers into dual-modality\nversions.

    "title": "Are Neural Ranking Models Robust?",
    "abstract": "Recently, we have witnessed the bloom of neural ranking models in the\ninformation retrieval (IR) field. So far, much effort has been devoted to\ndeveloping effective neural ranking models that can generalize well on new\ndata. There has been less attention paid to the robustness perspective. Unlike\nthe effectiveness which is about the average performance of a system under\nnormal purpose, robustness cares more about the system performance in the worst\ncase or under malicious operations instead. When a new technique enters into\nthe real-world application, it is critical to know not only how it works in\naverage, but also how would it behave in abnormal situations. So we raise the\nquestion in this work: Are neural ranking models robust? To answer this\nquestion, firstly, we need to clarify what we refer to when we talk about the\nrobustness of ranking models in IR. We show that robustness is actually a\nmulti-dimensional concept and there are three ways to define it in IR: 1) The\nperformance variance under the independent and identically distributed (I.I.D.)\nsetting; 2) The out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability; and 3) The\ndefensive ability against adversarial operations. The latter two definitions\ncan be further specified into two different perspectives respectively, leading\nto 5 robustness tasks in total. Based on this taxonomy, we build corresponding\nbenchmark datasets, design empirical experiments, and systematically analyze\nthe robustness of several representative neural ranking models against\ntraditional probabilistic ranking models and learning-to-rank (LTR) models. The\nempirical results show that there is no simple answer to our question. While\nneural ranking models are less robust against other IR models in most cases,\nsome of them can still win 1 out of 5 tasks. This is the first comprehensive\nstudy on the robustness of neural ranking models.",

    "abstract": "The frequency-based method is the most commonly used method for measuring\ncable tension. However, the calculation formulas for the conventional\nfrequency-based method are generally based on the ideally hinged or fixed\nboundary conditions without a comprehensive consideration of the inclination\nangle, sag-extensibility, and flexural stiffness of cables, leading to a\nsignificant error in cable tension identification. This study aimed to propose\na frequency-based method of cable tension identification considering the\ncomplex boundary conditions at the two ends of cables using the particle swarm\noptimization (PSO) algorithm. First, the refined stay cable model was\nestablished considering the inclination angle, flexural stiffness, and\nsag-extensibility, as well as the rotational constraint stiffness and lateral\nsupport stiffness for the unknown boundaries of cables. The vibration mode\nequation of the stay cable model was discretized and solved using the finite\ndifference method. Then, a multiparameter identification method based on the\nPSO algorithm was proposed. This method was able to identify the tension,\nflexural stiffness, axial stiffness, boundary rotational constraint stiffness,\nand boundary lateral support stiffness according to the measured multiorder\nfrequencies in a synchronous manner. The feasibility and accuracy of this\nmethod were validated through numerical cases. Finally, the proposed approach\nwas applied to the tension identification of the anchor span strands of a\nsuspension bridge (Jindong Bridge) in China. The results of cable tension\nidentification using the proposed method and the existing methods discussed in\nprevious studies were compared with the on-site pressure ring measurement\nresults. The comparison showed that the proposed approach had a high accuracy\nin cable tension identification.",

    "abstract": "Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNFET) emerge as a promising\nalternative to CMOS transistors for the much higher speed and energy\nefficiency, which makes the technology particularly suitable for building the\nenergy-hungry last level cache (LLC). However, the process variations (PVs) in\nCNFET caused by the imperfect fabrication lead to large timing variation and\nthe worst-case timing dramatically limits the LLC operation speed.\nParticularly, we observe that the CNFET-based cache latency distribution is\nclosely related to the LLC layouts. For the two typical LLC layouts that have\nthe CNT growth direction aligned to the cache way direction and cache set\ndirection respectively, we proposed variation-aware set aligned (VASA) cache\nand variation-aware way aligned (VAWA) cache in combination with corresponding\ncache optimizations such as data shuffling and page mapping to enable\nlow-latency cache for frequently used data. According to our experiments, the\noptimized LLC reduces the average access latency by 32% and 45% compared to the\nbaseline designs on the two different CNFET layouts respectively while it\nimproves the overall performance by 6\\% and 9\\% and reduces the energy\nconsumption by 4% and 8% respectively. In addition, with both the architecture\ninduced latency variation and PV incurred latency variation considered in a\nunified model, we extended the VAWA and VASA cache design for the CNFET-based\nNUCA and the proposed NUCA achieves both significant performance improvement\nand energy saving compared to the straightforward variation-aware NUCA.",

Traditional planning\nmethods are largely rule-based and scale poorly in these complex dynamic\nscenarios, often leading to reactive or even overly conservative behaviors.\nTherefore, they require tedious human efforts to maintain workability.\nRecently, deep learning-based methods have shown promising results with better\ngeneralization capability but less hand engineering effort.

The field of analysing\nthe data is called data mining. Unfortunately, the amount of data is quite\nlarge: the data do not fit into main memory and the processing time can become\nquite huge. Therefore, we need parallel data mining algorithms. One of the\npopular and important data mining algorithm is the algorithm for generation of\nso called frequent itemsets. The problem of mining of frequent itemsets can be\nexplained on the following example: customers goes in a store put into theirs\nbaskets some goods; the owner of the store collects the baskets and wants to\nknow the set of goods that are bought together in at least p% of the baskets.\nCurrently, the sequential algorithms for mining of frequent itemsets are quite\ngood in the means of performance. However, the parallel algorithms for mining\nof frequent itemsets still do not achieve good speedup. In this thesis, we\ndevelop a parallel method for mining of frequent itemsets that can be used for\nan arbitrary depth first search sequential algorithms on a distributed memory\nparallel computer. Our method achieves speedup of ~ 6 on 10 processors.

However, for each scenario, it is required to\nfirst collect enough data and then train such a domain adaptive re-id model,\nthus restricting their practical application. Instead, we aim to explore\nmultiple labeled datasets to learn generalized domain-invariant representations\nfor person re-id, which is expected universally effective for each new-coming\nre-id scenario. To pursue practicability in real-world systems, we collect all\nthe person re-id datasets (20 datasets) in this field and select the three most\nfrequently used datasets (i.e., Market1501, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17) as unseen\ntarget domains. In addition, we develop DataHunter that collects over 300K+\nweak annotated images named YouTube-Human from YouTube street-view videos,\nwhich joins 17 remaining full labeled datasets to form multiple source domains.\nOn such a large and challenging benchmark called FastHuman (~440K+ labeled\nimages), we further propose a simple yet effective Semi-Supervised Knowledge\nDistillation (SSKD) framework. SSKD effectively exploits the weakly annotated\ndata by assigning soft pseudo labels to YouTube-Human to improve models'\ngeneralization ability. Experiments on several protocols verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed SSKD framework on domain generalizable person\nre-id, which is even comparable to supervised learning on the target domains.\nLastly, but most importantly, we hope the proposed benchmark FastHuman could\nbring the next development of domain generalizable person re-id algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The underwater acoustic channel is one of the most challenging communication\nchannels. Due to periodical tidal and daily climatic variation, underwater\nnoise is periodically fluctuating, which result in the periodical changing of\nacoustic channel quality in long-term. Also, time-variant channel quality leads\nto routing failure. Routing protocols with acoustic channel estimation, namely\nunderwater channel-aware routing protocols are recently proposed to maintain\nthe routing performance. However, channel estimation algorithms for these\nrouting protocols are mostly linear and rarely consider periodicity of acoustic\nchannels. In this paper, we introduce acoustic channel estimation based on\nnearest neighbor regression for underwater acoustic networks. We extend nearest\nneighbor regression for SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) time series prediction,\nproviding an outstanding prediction accuracy for intricately periodical and\nfluctuating received SNR time series. Moreover, we propose a quick search\nalgorithm and use statistical storage compression to optimize the time and\nspace complexity of the algorithm. In contrast with linear methods, this\nalgorithm significantly improves channel prediction accuracy (over three times\nat most) on both simulation and sea trial data sets. With this channel\nestimation method, we then propose a Depth-Based Channel-Aware Routing protocol\n(DBCAR). Taking advantage of depth-greedy forwarding and channel-aware reliable\ncommunication, DBCAR has an outstanding network performance on packet delivery\nratio, average energy consumption and average transmission delay which is\nvalidated through extensive simulations.",

However, the overall visibility masking effect can be related with\nmore contributing factors beyond those have been considered in the literature\nand it is also insufficiently accurate to formulate the masking effect even for\nan individual factor. Moreover, the potential interactions among different\nmasking effects are also difficult to be characterized with a simple fusion\nmodel. In this work, we turn to a dramatically different way to address these\nproblems with a top-down design philosophy. Instead of formulating and fusing\nmultiple masking effects in a bottom-up way, the proposed JND estimation model\ndirectly generates a critical perceptual lossless (CPL) image from a top-down\nperspective and calculates the difference map between the original image and\nthe CPL image as the final JND map. Given an input image, an adaptively\ncritical point (perceptual lossless threshold), defined as the minimum number\nof spectral components in Karhunen-Lo\\'{e}ve Transform (KLT) used for\nperceptual lossless image reconstruction, is derived by exploiting the\nconvergence characteristics of KLT coefficient energy. Then, the CPL image can\nbe reconstructed via inverse KLT according to the derived critical point.\nFinally, the difference map between the original image and the CPL image is\ncalculated as the JND map. The performance of the proposed JND model is\nevaluated with two applications including JND-guided noise injection and\nJND-guided image compression. Experimental results have demonstrated that our\nproposed JND model can achieve better performance than several latest JND\nmodels.",

In this article, we propose to use the medical\nvisual language BERT (Medical-VLBERT) model to identify the abnormality on the\nCOVID-19 scans and generate the medical report automatically based on the\ndetected lesion regions. To produce more accurate medical reports and minimize\nthe visual-and-linguistic differences, this model adopts an alternate learning\nstrategy with two procedures that are knowledge pretraining and transferring.\nTo be more precise, the knowledge pretraining procedure is to memorize the\nknowledge from medical texts, while the transferring procedure is to utilize\nthe acquired knowledge for professional medical sentences generations through\nobservations of medical images. In practice, for automatic medical report\ngeneration on the COVID-19 cases, we constructed a dataset of 368 medical\nfindings in Chinese and 1104 chest CT scans from The First Affiliated Hospital\nof Jinan University, Guangzhou, China, and The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun\nYat-sen University, Zhuhai, China.

    "abstract": "Question Answering (QA), a popular and promising technique for intelligent\ninformation access, faces a dilemma about data as most other AI techniques. On\none hand, modern QA methods rely on deep learning models which are typically\ndata-hungry. Therefore, it is expected to collect and fuse all the available QA\ndatasets together in a common site for developing a powerful QA model. On the\nother hand, real-world QA datasets are typically distributed in the form of\nisolated islands belonging to different parties. Due to the increasing\nawareness of privacy security, it is almost impossible to integrate the data\nscattered around, or the cost is prohibited. A possible solution to this\ndilemma is a new approach known as federated learning, which is a\nprivacy-preserving machine learning technique over distributed datasets. In\nthis work, we propose to adopt federated learning for QA with the special\nconcern on the statistical heterogeneity of the QA data. Here the heterogeneity\nrefers to the fact that annotated QA data are typically with non-identical and\nindependent distribution (non-IID) and unbalanced sizes in practice.\nTraditional federated learning methods may sacrifice the accuracy of individual\nmodels under the heterogeneous situation. To tackle this problem, we propose a\nnovel Federated Matching framework for QA, named FedMatch, with a\nbackbone-patch architecture. The shared backbone is to distill the common\nknowledge of all the participants while the private patch is a compact and\nefficient module to retain the domain information for each participant.

    "title": "ULTRA: An Unbiased Learning To Rank Algorithm Toolbox",
    "abstract": "Learning to rank systems has become an important aspect of our daily life.\nHowever, the implicit user feedback that is used to train many learning to rank\nmodels is usually noisy and suffered from user bias (i.e., position bias).\nThus, obtaining an unbiased model using biased feedback has become an important\nresearch field for IR. Existing studies on unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) can\nbe generalized into two families-algorithms that attain unbiasedness with\nlogged data, offline learning, and algorithms that achieve unbiasedness by\nestimating unbiased parameters with real-time user interactions, namely online\nlearning. While there exist many algorithms from both families, there lacks a\nunified way to compare and benchmark them. As a result, it can be challenging\nfor researchers to choose the right technique for their problems or for people\nwho are new to the field to learn and understand existing algorithms. To solve\nthis problem, we introduced ULTRA, which is a flexible, extensible, and easily\nconfigure ULTR toolbox. Its key features include support for multiple ULTR\nalgorithms with configurable hyperparameters, a variety of built-in click\nmodels that can be used separately to simulate clicks, different ranking model\narchitecture and evaluation metrics, and simple learning to rank pipeline\ncreation. In this paper, we discuss the general framework of ULTR, briefly\ndescribe the algorithms in ULTRA, detailed the structure, and pipeline of the\ntoolbox. We experimented on all the algorithms supported by ultra and showed\nthat the toolbox performance is reasonable. Our toolbox is an important\nresource for researchers to conduct experiments on ULTR algorithms with\ndifferent configurations as well as testing their own algorithms with the\nsupported features.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial patch attack against image classification deep neural networks\n(DNNs), in which the attacker can inject arbitrary distortions within a bounded\nregion of an image, is able to generate adversarial perturbations that are\nrobust (i.e., remain adversarial in physical world) and universal (i.e., remain\nadversarial on any input). It is thus important to detect and mitigate such\nattack to ensure the security of DNNs.\nThis work proposes Jujutsu, a technique to detect and mitigate robust and\nuniversal adversarial patch attack. Jujutsu leverages the universal property of\nthe patch attack for detection. It uses explainable AI technique to identify\nsuspicious features that are potentially malicious, and verify their\nmaliciousness by transplanting the suspicious features to new images. An\nadversarial patch continues to exhibit the malicious behavior on the new images\nand thus can be detected based on prediction consistency. Jujutsu leverages the\nlocalized nature of the patch attack for mitigation, by randomly masking the\nsuspicious features to \"remove\" adversarial perturbations. However, the network\nmight fail to classify the images as some of the contents are removed (masked).\nTherefore, Jujutsu uses image inpainting for synthesizing alternative contents\nfrom the pixels that are masked, which can reconstruct the \"clean\" image for\ncorrect prediction. We evaluate Jujutsu on five DNNs on two datasets, and show\nthat Jujutsu achieves superior performance and significantly outperforms\nexisting techniques. Jujutsu can further defend against various variants of the\nbasic attack, including 1) physical-world attack; 2) attacks that target\ndiverse classes; 3) attacks that use patches in different shapes and 4)\nadaptive attacks.",

Recently, one-stage HOI detection methods have become popular.\nIn this paper, we aim to explore the essential pros and cons of two-stage and\none-stage methods. With this as the goal, we find that conventional two-stage\nmethods mainly suffer from positioning positive interactive human-object pairs,\nwhile one-stage methods are challenging to make an appropriate trade-off on\nmulti-task learning, i.e., object detection, and interaction classification.\nTherefore, a core problem is how to take the essence and discard the dregs from\nthe conventional two types of methods. To this end, we propose a novel\none-stage framework with disentangling human-object detection and interaction\nclassification in a cascade manner. In detail, we first design a human-object\npair generator based on a state-of-the-art one-stage HOI detector by removing\nthe interaction classification module or head and then design a relatively\nisolated interaction classifier to classify each human-object pair. Two cascade\ndecoders in our proposed framework can focus on one specific task, detection or\ninteraction classification. In terms of the specific implementation, we adopt a\ntransformer-based HOI detector as our base model. The newly introduced\ndisentangling paradigm outperforms existing methods by a large margin, with a\nsignificant relative mAP gain of 9.32% on HICO-Det.",

    "abstract": "In the era of intelligent transportation, driver behavior profiling has\nbecome a beneficial technology as it provides knowledge regarding the driver's\naggressiveness. Previous approaches achieved promising driver behavior\nprofiling performance through establishing statistical heuristics rules or\nsupervised learning-based models. Still, there exist limits that the\npractitioner should prepare a labeled dataset, and prior approaches could not\nclassify aggressive behaviors which are not known a priori. In pursuit of\nimproving the aforementioned drawbacks, we propose a novel approach to driver\nbehavior profiling leveraging an unsupervised learning paradigm. First, we cast\nthe driver behavior profiling problem as anomaly detection. Second, we\nestablished recurrent neural networks that predict the next feature vector\ngiven a sequence of feature vectors. We trained the model with normal driver\ndata only. As a result, our model yields high regression error given a sequence\nof aggressive driver behavior and low error given at a sequence of normal\ndriver behavior. We figured this difference of error between normal and\naggressive driver behavior can be an adequate flag for driver behavior\nprofiling and accomplished a precise performance in experiments. Lastly, we\nfurther analyzed the optimal level of sequence length for identifying each\naggressive driver behavior. We expect the proposed approach to be a useful\nbaseline for unsupervised driver behavior profiling and contribute to the\nefficient, intelligent transportation ecosystem.",

Recently, a new problem of\ngenerating cloned or synthesized human voice of a person is emerging. AI-based\ndeep learning models can synthesize any person's voice requiring just a few\nseconds of audio. With the emerging threat of impersonation attacks using\ndeepfake videos and audios, new deepfake detectors are need that focuses on\nboth, video and audio. Detecting deepfakes is a challenging task and\nresearchers have made numerous attempts and proposed several deepfake detection\nmethods. To develop a good deepfake detector, a handsome amount of good quality\ndataset is needed that captures the real world scenarios.

    "abstract": "Background: Cervical cancer seriously affects the health of the female\nreproductive system. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) emerges as a\nnon-invasive, high-resolution imaging technology for cervical disease\ndetection. However, OCT image annotation is knowledge-intensive and\ntime-consuming, which impedes the training process of deep-learning-based\nclassification models. Objective: This study aims to develop a computer-aided\ndiagnosis (CADx) approach to classifying in-vivo cervical OCT images based on\nself-supervised learning. Methods: Besides high-level semantic features\nextracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN), the proposed CADx approach\nleverages unlabeled cervical OCT images' texture features learned by\ncontrastive texture learning. We conducted ten-fold cross-validation on the OCT\nimage dataset from a multi-center clinical study on 733 patients from China.\nResults: In a binary classification task for detecting high-risk diseases,\nincluding high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and cervical\ncancer, our method achieved an area-under-the-curve (AUC) value of 0.9798 Plus\nor Minus 0.0157 with a sensitivity of 91.17 Plus or Minus 4.99% and a\nspecificity of 93.96 Plus or Minus 4.72% for OCT image patches; also, it\noutperformed two out of four medical experts on the test set.

In clinical practice, precise polyp segmentation provides important\ninformation in the early detection of colorectal cancer. Therefore, automatic\npolyp segmentation techniques are of great importance for both patients and\ndoctors. Most existing methods are based on U-shape structure and use\nelement-wise addition or concatenation to fuse different level features\nprogressively in decoder. However, both the two operations easily generate\nplenty of redundant information, which will weaken the complementarity between\ndifferent level features, resulting in inaccurate localization and blurred\nedges of polyps. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-scale\nsubtraction network (MSNet) to segment polyp from colonoscopy image.\nSpecifically, we first design a subtraction unit (SU) to produce the difference\nfeatures between adjacent levels in encoder. Then, we pyramidally equip the SUs\nat different levels with varying receptive fields, thereby obtaining rich\nmulti-scale difference information. In addition, we build a training-free\nnetwork \"LossNet\" to comprehensively supervise the polyp-aware features from\nbottom layer to top layer, which drives the MSNet to capture the detailed and\nstructural cues simultaneously. Extensive experiments on five benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our MSNet performs favorably against most\nstate-of-the-art methods under different evaluation metrics.

We determined that the ORKG\nreadily provides social and financial incentives, feedback elicitation\nchannels, and support for context and usage monitoring, but that there is\nimprovement potential regarding automated user feedback analyses and a holistic\nCrowdRE approach. (2) As crowd members, we explore how the ORKG can be used to\ncommunicate scholarly knowledge about CrowdRE research. For this purpose, we\ncurated qualitative and quantitative scholarly knowledge in the ORKG based on\npapers contained in two previously published systematic literature reviews\n(SLRs) on CrowdRE. This knowledge can be explored and compared interactively,\nand with more data than what the SLRs originally contained. Therefore, the ORKG\nimproves access and communication of the scholarly knowledge about CrowdRE\nresearch. For both perspectives, we found the ORKG to be a useful multi-tool\nfor CrowdRE research.",

The algorithm is decoupled in\nEls\\\"asser variables and permits a shared coefficient matrix for all members at\neach time-step. Thus, the algorithm is much more computationally efficient than\nseparately computing simulations for each member using usual MHD algorithms. We\nprove the proposed algorithm is unconditionally stable and convergent. Several\nnumerical tests are given to support the predicted convergence rates. Finally,\nwe test the proposed scheme and observe how the physical behavior changes as\nthe coupling number increases in a lid-driven cavity problem with mean Reynolds\nnumber $Re\\approx 15000$, and as the deviation of uncertainties in the initial\nand boundary conditions increases in a channel flow past a step problem.",

Several tools exist to remove\nunused (byte)code from an application or its dependencies, thus producing\nsmaller artifacts and, potentially, reducing the overall attack surface. In\nthis paper we evaluate the ability of three debloating tools to distinguish\nwhich dependency classes are necessary for an application to function correctly\nfrom those that could be safely removed. To do so, we conduct a case study on a\nreal-world commercial Java application. Our study shows that the tools we used\nwere able to correctly identify a considerable amount of redundant code, which\ncould be removed without altering the results of the existing application\ntests. One of the redundant classes turned out to be (formerly) vulnerable,\nconfirming that this technique has the potential to be applied for hardening\npurposes.

However, existing 3D\nvirtual try-on methods mainly rely on annotated 3D human shapes and garment\ntemplates, which hinders their applications in practical scenarios. 2D virtual\ntry-on approaches provide a faster alternative to manipulate clothed humans,\nbut lack the rich and realistic 3D representation. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Monocular-to-3D Virtual Try-On Network (M3D-VTON) that builds on the\nmerits of both 2D and 3D approaches. By integrating 2D information efficiently\nand learning a mapping that lifts the 2D representation to 3D, we make the\nfirst attempt to reconstruct a 3D try-on mesh only taking the target clothing\nand a person image as inputs. The proposed M3D-VTON includes three modules: 1)\nThe Monocular Prediction Module (MPM) that estimates an initial full-body depth\nmap and accomplishes 2D clothes-person alignment through a novel two-stage\nwarping procedure; 2) The Depth Refinement Module (DRM) that refines the\ninitial body depth to produce more detailed pleat and face characteristics; 3)\nThe Texture Fusion Module (TFM) that fuses the warped clothing with the\nnon-target body part to refine the results. We also construct a high-quality\nsynthesized Monocular-to-3D virtual try-on dataset, in which each person image\nis associated with a front and a back depth map.

Unlike previous\nlearning-based mesh denoising methods that exploit hand-crafted or voxel-based\nrepresentations for feature learning, our method explores the structure of a\ntriangular mesh itself and introduces a graph representation followed by graph\nconvolution operations in the dual space of triangles. We show such a graph\nrepresentation naturally captures the geometry features while being lightweight\nfor both training and inference. To facilitate effective feature learning, our\nnetwork exploits both static and dynamic edge convolutions, which allow us to\nlearn information from both the explicit mesh structure and potential implicit\nrelations among unconnected neighbors. To better approximate an unknown noise\nfunction, we introduce a cascaded optimization paradigm to progressively\nregress the noise-free facet normals with multiple GCNs. GCN-Denoiser achieves\nthe new state-of-the-art results in multiple noise datasets, including CAD\nmodels often containing sharp features and raw scan models with real noise\ncaptured from different devices. We also create a new dataset called PrintData\ncontaining 20 real scans with their corresponding ground-truth meshes for the\nresearch community.

In\nsituations in which the machine is expected to support the decision of human\nexperts, providing a comprehensible explanation is a feature of crucial\nimportance. The language used to communicate the explanations must be formal\nenough to be implementable in a machine and friendly enough to be\nunderstandable by a wide audience. In this paper, we propose a general approach\nto Explainable Artificial Intelligence in the case of neural architectures,\nshowing how a mindful design of the networks leads to a family of interpretable\ndeep learning models called Logic Explained Networks (LENs). LENs only require\ntheir inputs to be human-understandable predicates, and they provide\nexplanations in terms of simple First-Order Logic (FOL) formulas involving such\npredicates. LENs are general enough to cover a large number of scenarios.\nAmongst them, we consider the case in which LENs are directly used as special\nclassifiers with the capability of being explainable, or when they act as\nadditional networks with the role of creating the conditions for making a\nblack-box classifier explainable by FOL formulas. Despite supervised learning\nproblems are mostly emphasized, we also show that LENs can learn and provide\nexplanations in unsupervised learning settings.

    "abstract": "Development in the field of Single Board Computers (SBC) have been increasing\nfor several years. They provide a good balance between computing performance\nand power consumption which is usually required for mobile platforms, like\napplication in vehicles for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and\nAutonomous Driving (AD). However, there is an ever-increasing need of more\npowerful and efficient SBCs which can run power intensive Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) in real-time and can also satisfy necessary functional safety\nrequirements such as Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL). ProAI is being\ndeveloped by ZF mainly to run powerful and efficient applications such as\nmultitask DNNs and on top of that it also has the required safety certification\nfor AD. In this work, we compare and discuss state of the art SBC on the basis\nof power intensive multitask DNN architecture called Multitask-CenterNet with\nrespect to performance measures such as, FPS and power efficiency. As an\nautomotive supercomputer, ProAI delivers an excellent combination of\nperformance and efficiency, managing nearly twice the number of FPS per watt\nthan a modern workstation laptop and almost four times compared to the Jetson\nNano. Furthermore, it was also shown that there is still power in reserve for\nfurther and more complex tasks on the ProAI, based on the CPU and GPU\nutilization during the benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Successful continual learning of new knowledge would enable intelligent\nsystems to recognize more and more classes of objects. However, current\nintelligent systems often fail to correctly recognize previously learned\nclasses of objects when updated to learn new classes. It is widely believed\nthat such downgraded performance is solely due to the catastrophic forgetting\nof previously learned knowledge. In this study, we argue that the class\nconfusion phenomena may also play a role in downgrading the classification\nperformance during continual learning, i.e., the high similarity between new\nclasses and any previously learned classes would also cause the classifier to\nmake mistakes in recognizing these old classes, even if the knowledge of these\nold classes is not forgotten. To alleviate the class confusion issue, we\npropose a discriminative distillation strategy to help the classify well learn\nthe discriminative features between confusing classes during continual\nlearning. Experiments on multiple natural image classification tasks support\nthat the proposed distillation strategy, when combined with existing methods,\nis effective in further improving continual learning.",

A given visualization result is usually generated by applying a\nseries of transformations or filters to the underlying data. Nowadays, such\nfilters use deterministic algorithms to process the data. In this work, we aim\nat extending this methodology towards data-driven filters, thus filters that\nexpose the abilities of pre-trained machine learning models to the\nvisualization system. The use of such data-driven filters is of particular\ninterest in fields like segmentation, classification, etc., where machine\nlearning models regularly outperform existing algorithmic approaches. To\nshowcase this idea, we couple Paraview, the well-known flow visualization tool,\nwith PyTorch, a deep learning framework. Paraview is extended by plugins that\nallow users to load pre-trained models of their choice in the form of newly\ndeveloped filters. The filters transform the input data by feeding it into the\nmodel and then provide the model's output as input to the remaining\nvisualization pipeline. A series of simplistic use cases for segmentation and\nclassification on image and fluid data is presented to showcase the technical\napplicability of such data-driven transformations in Paraview for future\ncomplex analysis tasks.",

We call this\npractice of enriching the code with natural language intent to facilitate its\ncompletion natural language-guided programming.\nTo show that this idea is feasible we design, implement and benchmark a tool\nthat solves this problem in the context of a specific domain (data science) and\na specific programming language (Python).

    "abstract": "Entity alignment (EA) aims to find equivalent entities in different knowledge\ngraphs (KGs). Current EA approaches suffer from scalability issues, limiting\ntheir usage in real-world EA scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose\nLargeEA to align entities between large-scale KGs. LargeEA consists of two\nchannels, i.e., structure channel and name channel. For the structure channel,\nwe present METIS-CPS, a memory-saving mini-batch generation strategy, to\npartition large KGs into smaller mini-batches. LargeEA, designed as a general\ntool, can adopt any existing EA approach to learn entities' structural features\nwithin each mini-batch independently. For the name channel, we first introduce\nNFF, a name feature fusion method, to capture rich name features of entities\nwithout involving any complex training process. Then, we exploit a name-based\ndata augmentation to generate seed alignment without any human intervention.\nSuch design fits common real-world scenarios much better, as seed alignment is\nnot always available. Finally, LargeEA derives the EA results by fusing the\nstructural features and name features of entities. Since no widely-acknowledged\nbenchmark is available for large-scale EA evaluation, we also develop a\nlarge-scale EA benchmark called DBP1M extracted from real-world KGs.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently demonstrated superior capability\nof tackling graph analytical problems in various applications. Nevertheless,\nwith the wide-spreading practice of GNNs in high-stake decision-making\nprocesses, there is an increasing societal concern that GNNs could make\ndiscriminatory decisions that may be illegal towards certain demographic\ngroups. Although some explorations have been made towards developing fair GNNs,\nexisting approaches are tailored for a specific GNN model. However, in\npractical scenarios, myriads of GNN variants have been proposed for different\ntasks, and it is costly to train and fine-tune existing debiasing models for\ndifferent GNNs. Also, bias in a trained model could originate from training\ndata, while how to mitigate bias in the graph data is usually overlooked. In\nthis work, different from existing work, we first propose novel definitions and\nmetrics to measure the bias in an attributed network, which leads to the\noptimization objective to mitigate bias. Based on the optimization objective,\nwe develop a framework named EDITS to mitigate the bias in attributed networks\nwhile preserving useful information. EDITS works in a model-agnostic manner,\nwhich means that it is independent of the specific GNNs applied for downstream\ntasks. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the validity of the proposed bias metrics and the superiority of\nEDITS on both bias mitigation and utility maintenance.

We investigate a\nsignaling game problem where an encoder observes a multi-dimensional source and\nconveys a message to a decoder, and the quadratic objectives of the encoder and\ndecoder are misaligned due to a bias vector. We first provide a set of geometry\nconditions that needs to be satisfied in equilibrium considering any\nmulti-dimensional source. Then, we consider independent and identically\ndistributed sources and completely characterize conditions under which an\ninformative linear Nash equilibrium exists. In particular, we show that if the\ncomponents of the bias vector are not equal in magnitude, then there exists a\nlinear equilibrium if and only if the source distribution is Gaussian. On the\nother hand, for a linear equilibrium to exist in the case of equal bias\ncomponents, it is required that the source density is symmetric around its\nmean. Moreover, in the case of Gaussian sources, our results have a\nrate-distortion theoretic implication that achievable rates and distortions in\nthe considered game theoretic setup can be obtained from their team theoretic\ncounterpart.",

    "abstract": "To create efficient-high performing processes, one must find an optimal\ndesign with its corresponding controller that ensures optimal operation in the\npresence of uncertainty. When comparing different process designs, for the\ncomparison to be meaningful, each design must involve its optimal operation.\nTherefore, to optimize a process' design, one must address design and control\nsimultaneously. For this, one can formulate a bilevel optimization problem,\nwith the design as the outer problem in the form of a mixed-integer nonlinear\nprogram (MINLP) and a stochastic optimal control as the inner problem. This is\nintractable by most approaches. In this paper we propose to compute the optimal\ncontrol using reinforcement learning, and then embed this controller into the\ndesign problem. This allows to decouple the solution procedure, while having\nthe same optimal result as if solving the bilevel problem. The approach is\ntested in two case studies and the performance of the controller is evaluated.\nThe case studies indicate that the proposed approach outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art simultaneous design and control strategies.

Given noisy depth maps, a\ncamera trajectory, and 2D semantic labels at train time, the proposed neural\nnetwork learns to fuse the depth over frames with suitable semantic labels in\nthe scene space. Our approach exploits the joint volumetric representation of\nthe depth and semantics in the scene feature space to solve this task.

    "abstract": "Many camera sensors use a dual-pixel (DP) design that operates as a\nrudimentary light field providing two sub-aperture views of a scene in a single\ncapture. The DP sensor was developed to improve how cameras perform autofocus.\nSince the DP sensor's introduction, researchers have found additional uses for\nthe DP data, such as depth estimation, reflection removal, and defocus\ndeblurring. We are interested in the latter task of defocus deblurring. In\nparticular, we propose a single-image deblurring network that incorporates the\ntwo sub-aperture views into a multi-task framework. Specifically, we show that\njointly learning to predict the two DP views from a single blurry input image\nimproves the network's ability to learn to deblur the image. Our experiments\nshow this multi-task strategy achieves +1dB PSNR improvement over\nstate-of-the-art defocus deblurring methods. In addition, our multi-task\nframework allows accurate DP-view synthesis (e.g., ~ 39dB PSNR) from the single\ninput image. These high-quality DP views can be used for other DP-based\napplications, such as reflection removal. As part of this effort, we have\ncaptured a new dataset of 7,059 high-quality images to support our training for\nthe DP-view synthesis task.

Both the columns and\nrows of the tabular data carry useful patterns that could improve the model\nprediction performance. However, most existing models focus on the cross-column\npatterns yet overlook the cross-row patterns as they deal with single samples\nindependently. In this work, we propose a general learning framework named\nRetrieval & Interaction Machine (RIM) that fully exploits both cross-row and\ncross-column patterns among tabular data. Specifically, RIM first leverages\nsearch engine techniques to efficiently retrieve useful rows of the table to\nassist the label prediction of the target row, then uses feature interaction\nnetworks to capture the cross-column patterns among the target row and the\nretrieved rows so as to make the final label prediction. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on 11 datasets of three important tasks, i.e., CTR prediction\n(classification), top-n recommendation (ranking) and rating prediction\n(regression).

In this paper,\nwe examine the computational ability of Boolean decision trees in deriving,\nminimizing, and counting sufficient reasons and contrastive explanations. We\nprove that the set of all sufficient reasons of minimal size for an instance\ngiven a decision tree can be exponentially larger than the size of the input\n(the instance and the decision tree). Therefore, generating the full set of\nsufficient reasons can be out of reach. In addition, computing a single\nsufficient reason does not prove enough in general; indeed, two sufficient\nreasons for the same instance may differ on many features. To deal with this\nissue and generate synthetic views of the set of all sufficient reasons, we\nintroduce the notions of relevant features and of necessary features that\ncharacterize the (possibly negated) features appearing in at least one or in\nevery sufficient reason, and we show that they can be computed in polynomial\ntime. We also introduce the notion of explanatory importance, that indicates\nhow frequent each (possibly negated) feature is in the set of all sufficient\nreasons. We show how the explanatory importance of a feature and the number of\nsufficient reasons can be obtained via a model counting operation, which turns\nout to be practical in many cases.

    "abstract": "Entity alignment (EA) aims to find the equivalent entities in different KGs,\nwhich is a crucial step in integrating multiple KGs. However, most existing EA\nmethods have poor scalability and are unable to cope with large-scale datasets.\nWe summarize three issues leading to such high time-space complexity in\nexisting EA methods: (1) Inefficient graph encoders, (2) Dilemma of negative\nsampling, and (3) \"Catastrophic forgetting\" in semi-supervised learning. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel EA method with three new\ncomponents to enable high Performance, high Scalability, and high Robustness\n(PSR): (1) Simplified graph encoder with relational graph sampling, (2)\nSymmetric negative-free alignment loss, and (3) Incremental semi-supervised\nlearning. Furthermore, we conduct detailed experiments on several public\ndatasets to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.\nThe experimental results show that PSR not only surpasses the previous SOTA in\nperformance but also has impressive scalability and robustness.",

Although some works propose to\nbuild cross-reference between support and query images, their extraction of\nquery information still depends on the support images. We here propose to\nextract the information from the query itself independently to benefit the\nfew-shot segmentation task. To this end, we first propose a prior extractor to\nlearn the query information from the unlabeled images with our proposed\nglobal-local contrastive learning. Then, we extract a set of predetermined\npriors via this prior extractor. With the obtained priors, we generate the\nprior region maps for query images, which locate the objects, as guidance to\nperform cross interaction with support features. In such a way, the extraction\nof query information is detached from the support branch, overcoming the\nlimitation by support, and could obtain more informative query clues to achieve\nbetter interaction. Without bells and whistles, the proposed approach achieves\nnew state-of-the-art performance for the few-shot segmentation task on\nPASCAL-5$^{i}$ and COCO datasets.",

Although stable\nmethods for AID of plant parameters for this class of systems, as well numerous\napproaches to stable model-based direct adaptive trajectory-tracking control of\nsuch systems, have been reported, these studies have been unable to prove\nanalytically that the adaptive parameter estimates converge to the true plant\nparameter values.

When the UCO condition\nis satisfied, the adaptive parameter estimates are shown to converge to the\ntrue plant parameter values. To the best of our knowledge this is the first\nreported proof for this class of systems of UCO of plant parameters and for\nconvergence of adaptive parameter estimates to true parameter values.\nWe also report a numerical simulation study of this AID approach which shows\nthat (a) the UCO condition can be met for fully-actuated plants as well as\nunderactuated plants with the proper choice of control input and (b)\nconvergence of adaptive parameter estimates to the true parameter values.

For image super-resolution (SR), it learns to predict diverse\nphoto-realistic high-resolution (HR) images from the low-resolution (LR) image\nrather than learning a deterministic mapping. For image rescaling, it achieves\nhigh accuracy by jointly modelling the downscaling and upscaling processes.\nWhile existing approaches employ specialized techniques for these two tasks, we\nset out to unify them in a single formulation. In this paper, we propose the\nhierarchical conditional flow (HCFlow) as a unified framework for image SR and\nimage rescaling. More specifically, HCFlow learns a bijective mapping between\nHR and LR image pairs by modelling the distribution of the LR image and the\nrest high-frequency component simultaneously. In particular, the high-frequency\ncomponent is conditional on the LR image in a hierarchical manner. To further\nenhance the performance, other losses such as perceptual loss and GAN loss are\ncombined with the commonly used negative log-likelihood loss in training.\nExtensive experiments on general image SR, face image SR and image rescaling\nhave demonstrated that the proposed HCFlow achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.",

    "abstract": "Existing blind image super-resolution (SR) methods mostly assume blur kernels\nare spatially invariant across the whole image. However, such an assumption is\nrarely applicable for real images whose blur kernels are usually spatially\nvariant due to factors such as object motion and out-of-focus. Hence, existing\nblind SR methods would inevitably give rise to poor performance in real\napplications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a mutual affine\nnetwork (MANet) for spatially variant kernel estimation. Specifically, MANet\nhas two distinctive features. First, it has a moderate receptive field so as to\nkeep the locality of degradation. Second, it involves a new mutual affine\nconvolution (MAConv) layer that enhances feature expressiveness without\nincreasing receptive field, model size and computation burden. This is made\npossible through exploiting channel interdependence, which applies each channel\nsplit with an affine transformation module whose input are the rest channel\nsplits. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real images show that the\nproposed MANet not only performs favorably for both spatially variant and\ninvariant kernel estimation, but also leads to state-of-the-art blind SR\nperformance when combined with non-blind SR methods.",

    "abstract": "Vision transformers have attracted much attention from computer vision\nresearchers as they are not restricted to the spatial inductive bias of\nConvNets. However, although Transformer-based backbones have achieved much\nprogress on ImageNet classification, it is still unclear whether the learned\nrepresentations are as transferable as or even more transferable than ConvNets'\nfeatures. To address this point, we systematically investigate the transfer\nlearning ability of ConvNets and vision transformers in 15 single-task and\nmulti-task performance evaluations. Given the strong correlation between the\nperformance of pre-trained models and transfer learning, we include 2 residual\nConvNets (i.e., R-101x3 and R-152x4) and 3 Transformer-based visual backbones\n(i.e., ViT-B, ViT-L and Swin-B), which have close error rates on ImageNet, that\nindicate similar transfer learning performance on downstream datasets.\nWe observe consistent advantages of Transformer-based backbones on 13\ndownstream tasks (out of 15), including but not limited to fine-grained\nclassification, scene recognition (classification, segmentation and depth\nestimation), open-domain classification, face recognition, etc. More\nspecifically, we find that two ViT models heavily rely on whole network\nfine-tuning to achieve performance gains while Swin Transformer does not have\nsuch a requirement. Moreover, vision transformers behave more robustly in\nmulti-task learning, i.e., bringing more improvements when managing mutually\nbeneficial tasks and reducing performance losses when tackling irrelevant\ntasks. We hope our discoveries can facilitate the exploration and exploitation\nof vision transformers in the future.",

In the last years, several works have addressed this\nproblem with heavy and complex models that try to capture visual-textual\ndependencies better than before.

In this paper, we find that some\nhidden units of the network are selective to certain ranges of depth, and thus\nsuch behavior can be served as a way to interpret the internal representations.\nBased on our observations, we quantify the interpretability of a deep MDE\nnetwork by the depth selectivity of its hidden units.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel modelling approach for a heavy-duty manipulator\nwith parallel$-$serial structures connected in series. Each considered\nparallel$-$serial structure contains a revolute segment with rigid links\nconnected by a passive revolute joint and actuated by a linear hydraulic\nactuator, thus forming a closed kinematic loop. In addition, prismatic\nsegments, consisting of prismatic joints driven by hydraulic linear actuators,\nalso are considered. Expressions for actuator forces are derived using the\nNewton$-$Euler (N$-$E) dynamics formulation. The derivation process does not\nassume massless actuators decoupled from manipulator links, which is common in\nthe Lagrange dynamics formulation. Actuator pressure dynamics are included in\nthe analysis, leading in total to a third-order system of ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs). The proposed model in the N$-$E framework, with fewer\nparameters than its predecessors, inspires revision of the virtual\ndecomposition control (VDC) systematic process to formulate a control law based\non the new model. The virtual stability of each generic manipulator revolute\nand prismatic segment is obtained, leading to the Lyapunov stability of the\nentire robot.",

    "abstract": "Tracking multiple objects individually differs from tracking groups of\nrelated objects. When an object is a part of the group, its trajectory depends\non the trajectories of the other group members. Most of the current\nstate-of-the-art trackers follow the approach of tracking each object\nindependently, with the mechanism to handle the overlapping trajectories where\nnecessary. Such an approach does not take inter-object relations into account,\nwhich may cause unreliable tracking for the members of the groups, especially\nin crowded scenarios, where individual cues become unreliable due to\nocclusions. To overcome these limitations and to extend such trackers to\ncrowded scenes, we propose a plug-in Relation Encoding Module (REM). REM\nencodes relations between tracked objects by running a message passing over a\ncorresponding spatio-temporal graph, computing relation embeddings for the\ntracked objects. Our experiments on MOT17 and MOT20 demonstrate that the\nbaseline tracker improves its results after a simple extension with REM. The\nproposed module allows for tracking severely or even fully occluded objects by\nutilizing relational cues.",

So far the existing research has been\nmostly focusing on the development of quantitative metrics to measure algorithm\ndisparities across different protected groups, and approaches for adjusting the\nalgorithm output to reduce such disparities. In this paper, we propose to study\nthe problem of identification of the source of model disparities. Unlike\nexisting interpretation methods which typically learn feature importance, we\nconsider the causal relationships among feature variables and propose a novel\nframework to decompose the disparity into the sum of contributions from\nfairness-aware causal paths, which are paths linking the sensitive attribute\nand the final predictions, on the graph. We also consider the scenario when the\ndirections on certain edges within those paths cannot be determined. Our\nframework is also model agnostic and applicable to a variety of quantitative\ndisparity measures. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world data\nsets are provided to show that our method can provide precise and comprehensive\nexplanations to the model disparities.",

First, the motivation for emphatic TD methods\nproposed by Sutton et al. (2016) does not align with the convergence analysis\nof Yu (2015). Namely, a quantity used by Sutton et al. (2016) that is expected\nto be essential for the convergence of emphatic TD methods is not used in the\nactual convergence analysis of Yu (2015). Second, followon traces typically\nsuffer from large variance, making them hard to use in practice. Third, despite\nthe seminal work of Yu (2015) confirming the asymptotic convergence of some\nemphatic TD methods for prediction problems, there is still no finite sample\nanalysis for any emphatic TD method for prediction, much less control. In this\npaper, we address those three open problems simultaneously via using truncated\nfollowon traces in emphatic TD methods.

Unlike conventional attention-based methods which only learn\na global attention map, our attention pyramid exploits the attention regions in\na multi-scale manner because human attention varies with different scales. Our\nattention pyramid imitates the process of human visual perception which tends\nto notice the foreground person over the cluttered background, and further\nfocus on the specific color of the shirt with close observation. Specifically,\nwe describe our attention pyramid by a \"split-attend-merge-stack\" principle. We\nfirst split the features into multiple local parts and learn the corresponding\nattentions. Then, we merge local attentions and stack these merged attentions\nwith the residual connection as an attention pyramid. The proposed attention\npyramid is a lightweight plug-and-play module that can be applied to\noff-the-shelf models. We implement our attention pyramid method in two\ndifferent attention mechanisms including channel-wise attention and spatial\nattention. We evaluate our method on four largescale person re-identification\nbenchmarks including Market-1501, DukeMTMC, CUHK03, and MSMT17.

    "abstract": "Being light-weight and cost-effective, IR-based approaches for bug\nlocalization have shown promise in finding software bugs. However, the accuracy\nof these approaches heavily depends on their used bug reports. A significant\nnumber of bug reports contain only plain natural language texts. According to\nexisting studies, IR-based approaches cannot perform well when they use these\nbug reports as search queries. On the other hand, there is a piece of recent\nevidence that suggests that even these natural language-only reports contain\nenough good keywords that could help localize the bugs successfully. On one\nhand, these findings suggest that natural language-only bug reports might be a\nsufficient source for good query keywords. On the other hand, they cast serious\ndoubt on the query selection practices in the IR-based bug localization. In\nthis article, we attempted to clear the sky on this aspect by conducting an\nin-depth empirical study that critically examines the state-of-the-art query\nselection practices in IR-based bug localization. In particular, we use a\ndataset of 2,320 bug reports, employ ten existing approaches from the\nliterature, exploit the Genetic Algorithm-based approach to construct optimal,\nnear-optimal search queries from these bug reports, and then answer three\nresearch questions. We confirmed that the state-of-the-art query construction\napproaches are indeed not sufficient for constructing appropriate queries (for\nbug localization) from certain natural language-only bug reports although they\ncontain such queries. We also demonstrate that optimal queries and non-optimal\nqueries chosen from bug report texts are significantly different in terms of\nseveral keyword characteristics, which has led us to actionable insights.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate 27%--34% improvement in the performance of\nnon-optimal queries through the application of our actionable insights to them.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the evolution of human social systems requires flexible\nformalisms for the emergence of institutions. Although game theory is normally\nused to model interactions individually, larger spaces of games can be helpful\nfor modeling how interactions change. We introduce a framework for modeling\n\"institutional evolution,\" how individuals change the games they are placed in.\nWe contrast this with the more familiar within-game \"behavioral evolution\".\nStarting from an initial game, agents trace trajectories through game space by\nrepeatedly navigating to more preferable games until they converge on attractor\ngames that are preferred to all others. Agents choose between games on the\nbasis of their \"institutional preferences,\" which define between-game\ncomparisons in terms of game-level features such as stability, fairness, and\nefficiency. Computing institutional change trajectories over the two-player\nspace, we find that the attractors of self-interested economic agents\nover-represent fairness by 100% relative to baseline, even though those agents\nare indifferent to fairness. This seems to occur because fairness, as a game\nfeature, co-occurs with the self-serving features these agents do prefer. We\nthus present institutional evolution as a mechanism for encouraging the\nspontaneous emergence of cooperation among inherently selfish agents. We then\nextend these findings beyond two players, and to two other types of\nevolutionary agent: the relative fitness maximizing agent of evolutionary game\ntheory (who maximizes inequality), and the relative group fitness maximizing\nagent of multi-level/group selection theory (who minimizes inequality).

Data scarcity is one of the major challenges in building reliable\nmachine learning models. Data scarcity combined with the use of pre-calculated\nhand-crafted input features has led to problems of overfitting and data\nleakage.\nWe overcome the limitations of existing works by proposing a novel\nmulti-tasking convolution-based approach, which we refer to as MuCoMiD. MuCoMiD\nallows automatic feature extraction while incorporating knowledge from 4\nheterogeneous biological information sources (interactions between\nmiRNA/diseases and protein-coding genes (PCG), miRNA family information, and\ndisease ontology) in a multi-task setting which is a novel perspective and has\nnot been studied before.

To effectively test the generalization capability of our\nmodel, we construct large-scale experiments on standard benchmark datasets as\nwell as our proposed larger independent test sets and case studies. MuCoMiD\nshows an improvement of at least 5% in 5-fold CV evaluation on HMDDv2.0 and\nHMDDv3.0 datasets and at least 49% on larger independent test sets with unseen\nmiRNA and diseases over state-of-the-art approaches.

    "title": "A data-driven peridynamic continuum model for upscaling molecular  dynamics",
    "abstract": "Nonlocal models, including peridynamics, often use integral operators that\nembed lengthscales in their definition. However, the integrands in these\noperators are difficult to define from the data that are typically available\nfor a given physical system, such as laboratory mechanical property tests. In\ncontrast, molecular dynamics (MD) does not require these integrands, but it\nsuffers from computational limitations in the length and time scales it can\naddress. To combine the strengths of both methods and to obtain a\ncoarse-grained, homogenized continuum model that efficiently and accurately\ncaptures materials' behavior, we propose a learning framework to extract, from\nMD data, an optimal Linear Peridynamic Solid (LPS) model as a surrogate for MD\ndisplacements. To maximize the accuracy of the learnt model we allow the\nperidynamic influence function to be partially negative, while preserving the\nwell-posedness of the resulting model. To achieve this, we provide sufficient\nwell-posedness conditions for discretized LPS models with sign-changing\ninfluence functions and develop a constrained optimization algorithm that\nminimizes the equation residual while enforcing such solvability conditions.\nThis framework guarantees that the resulting model is mathematically\nwell-posed, physically consistent, and that it generalizes well to settings\nthat are different from the ones used during training. We illustrate the\nefficacy of the proposed approach with several numerical tests for single layer\ngraphene. Our two-dimensional tests show the robustness of the proposed\nalgorithm on validation data sets that include thermal noise, different domain\nshapes and external loadings, and discretizations substantially different from\nthe ones used for training.",

Methods: We use a parametric imaging approach\nby which STIX visibility amplitudes are fitted by means of two non-linear\noptimization methods: a fast meta-heuristic technique inspired by social\nbehavior, and a Bayesian Monte Carlo sampling method, which, although slower,\nprovides better quantification of uncertainties. Results: When applied to a set\nof solar flare visibility amplitudes recorded by STIX on November 18, 2020 the\ntwo parametric methods provide very coherent results. The analysis also\ndemonstrates the ability of STIX to reconstruct high time resolution\ninformation and, from a spectral viewpoint, shows the reliability of a\ndouble-source scenario consistent with a thermal versus nonthermal\ninterpretation. Conclusions: In this preliminary analysis of STIX imaging based\nonly on visibility amplitudes, we formulate the imaging problem as a non-linear\nparametric issue we addressed by means of two high-performance optimization\ntechniques that both showed the ability to sample the parametric space in an\neffective fashion, thus avoiding local minima.",

Directional communication is an intrinsic attribute of THz\nwireless networks and the knowledge of direction should be harvested\ncontinuously to maintain link quality. Direction discovery can potentially\nimpose an immense burden on the network that limits its communication capacity\nexceedingly. To utterly mitigate direction discovery overhead, we propose a\nnovel technique called spectrum shaping capable of measuring direction, power,\nand relative distance of propagation paths via a single measurement. We\ndemonstrate that the proposed technique is also able to measure the transmitter\nantenna orientation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed design in\nseveral scenarios and show that the introduced technique performs similar to a\nlarge array of antennas while attaining a much simpler hardware architecture.\nResults show that the spectrum shaping with only two antennas placed 0.5 mm, 5\nmm, and 1 cm apart performs direction of arrival estimation similar to a much\nmore complex uniform linear array equipped with 7, 60, and 120 antennas,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "Most psychophysical experiments discard half the data collected.\nSpecifically, experiments discard reaction time data, and use binary responses\n(e.g. yes/no) to measure performance. Here, Shannon's information theory is\nused to define Shannon competence $s'$, which depends on the mutual information\nbetween stimulus strength (e.g. luminance) and a combination of reaction times\nand binary responses. Mutual information is the entropy of the joint\ndistribution of responses minus the residual entropy after a model has been\nfitted to these responses. Here, this model is instantiated as a proportional\nrate diffusion model, with the additional innovation that the full covariance\nstructure of responses is taken into account. Results suggest information\nassociated with reaction times is independent of (i.e. additional to)\ninformation associated with binary responses, and that reaction time and binary\nresponses together provide substantially more than the sum of their individual\ncontributions (i.e. they act synergistically). Consequently, the additional\ninformation supplied by reaction times suggests that using combined reaction\ntime and binary responses requires fewer stimulus presentations, without loss\nof precision in psychophysical parameters. Finally, because s' takes account of\nboth reaction time and binary responses, (and in contrast to d') $s'$ is immune\nto speed-accuracy trade-offs, which vary between observers and experimental\ndesigns.",

The problem of tree-based\naggregation that we consider in this paper asks which of these tree-defined\nsubgroups of leaves should really be treated as a single entity and which of\nthese entities should be distinguished from each other.\nWe introduce the \"false split rate\", an error measure that describes the\ndegree to which subgroups have been split when they should not have been. We\nthen propose a multiple hypothesis testing algorithm for tree-based\naggregation, which we prove controls this error measure. We focus on two main\nexamples of tree-based aggregation, one which involves aggregating means and\nthe other which involves aggregating regression coefficients. We apply this\nmethodology to aggregate stocks based on their volatility and to aggregate\nneighborhoods of New York City based on taxi fares.",
