    "abstract": "Multimodal target/aspect sentiment classification combines multimodal\nsentiment analysis and aspect/target sentiment classification. The goal of the\ntask is to combine vision and language to understand the sentiment towards a\ntarget entity in a sentence. Twitter is an ideal setting for the task because\nit is inherently multimodal, highly emotional, and affects real world events.\nHowever, multimodal tweets are short and accompanied by complex, possibly\nirrelevant images. We introduce a two-stream model that translates images in\ninput space using an object-aware transformer followed by a single-pass\nnon-autoregressive text generation approach. We then leverage the translation\nto construct an auxiliary sentence that provides multimodal information to a\nlanguage model. Our approach increases the amount of text available to the\nlanguage model and distills the object-level information in complex images. We\nachieve state-of-the-art performance on two multimodal Twitter datasets without\nmodifying the internals of the language model to accept multimodal data,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of our translation. In addition, we explain a\nfailure mode of a popular approach for aspect sentiment analysis when applied\nto tweets.

    "title": "Vision Transformer with Progressive Sampling",
    "abstract": "Transformers with powerful global relation modeling abilities have been\nintroduced to fundamental computer vision tasks recently. As a typical example,\nthe Vision Transformer (ViT) directly applies a pure transformer architecture\non image classification, by simply splitting images into tokens with a fixed\nlength, and employing transformers to learn relations between these tokens.\nHowever, such naive tokenization could destruct object structures, assign grids\nto uninterested regions such as background, and introduce interference signals.\nTo mitigate the above issues, in this paper, we propose an iterative and\nprogressive sampling strategy to locate discriminative regions. At each\niteration, embeddings of the current sampling step are fed into a transformer\nencoder layer, and a group of sampling offsets is predicted to update the\nsampling locations for the next step. The progressive sampling is\ndifferentiable. When combined with the Vision Transformer, the obtained PS-ViT\nnetwork can adaptively learn where to look. The proposed PS-ViT is both\neffective and efficient. When trained from scratch on ImageNet, PS-ViT performs\n3.8% higher than the vanilla ViT in terms of top-1 accuracy with about\n$4\\times$ fewer parameters and $10\\times$ fewer FLOPs.

A salient list of cybersecurity knowledge is the Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list, which details vulnerabilities found\nin a wide range of software and hardware.

Despite the tremendous\nbenefits that both CVEs and the ATT&CK framework can provide for key\ncybersecurity stakeholders (e.g., analysts, educators, and managers), the two\nentities are currently separate.

It is an\nopen question at present whether such an endeavor is feasible, and how it\ncompares to baselines that only use constant priors. To our knowledge, a proper\nmethodology and evaluation results using real data has also not been presented.\nIn this article, we present such a methodology and experimental study, using\npublicly available Twitter data collected over the last year.

    "abstract": "Electronic Health Records often suffer from missing data, which poses a major\nproblem in clinical practice and clinical studies. A novel approach for dealing\nwith missing data are Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), which have been\ngenerating huge research interest in image generation and transformation.\nRecently, researchers have attempted to apply GANs to missing data generation\nand imputation for EHR data: a major challenge here is the categorical nature\nof the data. State-of-the-art solutions to the GAN-based generation of\ncategorical data involve either reinforcement learning, or learning a\nbidirectional mapping between the categorical and the real latent feature\nspace, so that the GANs only need to generate real-valued features. However,\nthese methods are designed to generate complete feature vectors instead of\nimputing only the subsets of missing features. In this paper we propose a\nsimple and yet effective approach that is based on previous work on GANs for\ndata imputation. We first motivate our solution by discussing the reason why\nadversarial training often fails in case of categorical features. Then we\nderive a novel way to re-code the categorical features to stabilize the\nadversarial training. Based on experiments on two real-world EHR data with\nmultiple settings, we show that our imputation approach largely improves the\nprediction accuracy, compared to more traditional data imputation approaches.",

Among various forms of regularization, the lp penalty term\nprovides a suite of regularization of various characteristics depending on the\nvalue of p. When there are no explicit features to determine p, a spatially\nvarying inhomogeneous p can be incorporated to apply different regularization\ncharacteristics that change over the domain. This approach has been\ninvestigated and used for denoising problems where the first or the second\nderivatives of the true signal provide information to design the spatially\nvarying exponent p distribution. This study proposes a strategy to design the\nexponent distribution when the first and second derivatives of the true signal\nare not available, such as in the case of indirect and limited measurement\ndata. The proposed method extracts statistical and patch-wise information using\nmultiple reconstructions from a single measurement, which assists in\nclassifying each patch to predefined features with corresponding p values. We\nvalidate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach through a\nsuite of numerical tests in 1D and 2D, including a sea ice image recovery from\npartial Fourier measurement data.

We use a\nsecond-order boundary value method as the time integrator that leads to a\ntridiagonal time discretization matrix. Instead of solving the corresponding\nall-at-once system iteratively, we diagonalize the time discretization matrix,\nwhich yields a direct parallel implementation across all time levels. A crucial\nissue on this methodology is how the condition number of the eigenvector matrix\n$V$ grows as $n$ is increased, where $n$ is the number of time levels. A large\ncondition number leads to large roundoff error in the diagonalization\nprocedure, which could seriously pollute the numerical accuracy.

    "abstract": "Deep learning achieves remarkable performance on pattern recognition, but can\nbe vulnerable to defects of some important properties such as robustness and\nsecurity. This tutorial is based on a stream of research conducted since the\nsummer of 2018 at a few UK universities, including the University of Liverpool,\nUniversity of Oxford, Queen's University Belfast, University of Lancaster,\nUniversity of Loughborough, and University of Exeter.\nThe research aims to adapt software engineering methods, in particular\nsoftware testing methods, to work with machine learning models. Software\ntesting techniques have been successful in identifying software bugs, and\nhelping software developers in validating the software they design and\nimplement. It is for this reason that a few software testing techniques -- such\nas the MC/DC coverage metric -- have been mandated in industrial standards for\nsafety critical systems, including the ISO26262 for automotive systems and the\nRTCA DO-178B/C for avionics systems. However, these techniques cannot be\ndirectly applied to machine learning models, because the latter are drastically\ndifferent from traditional software, and their design follows a completely\ndifferent development life-cycle.\nAs the outcome of this thread of research, the team has developed a series of\nmethods that adapt the software testing techniques to work with a few classes\nof machine learning models. The latter notably include convolutional neural\nnetworks, recurrent neural networks, and random forest. The tools developed\nfrom this research are now collected, and publicly released, in a GitHub\nrepository: \\url{https://github.com/TrustAI/DeepConcolic}, with the BSD\n3-Clause licence.\nThis tutorial is to go through the major functionalities of the tools with a\nfew running examples, to exhibit how the developed techniques work, what the\nresults are, and how to interpret them.",

Concretely, it is assumed that the standard $\\local$ model\nof distributed computing is enhanced with the feature of all-to-all\ncommunication, but with very limited bandwidth, captured by the\nnode-capacitated clique ($\\ncc$). In this work we provide several new insights\non the power of hybrid networks for fundamental problems in distributed\nalgorithms.\nFirst, we present a deterministic algorithm which solves any problem on a\nsparse $n$-node graph in $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{n})$ rounds of\n$\\hybrid$. We combine this primitive with several sparsification techniques to\nobtain efficient distributed algorithms for general graphs. Most notably, for\nthe all-pairs shortest paths problem we give deterministic $(1 + \\epsilon)$-\nand $\\log n/\\log \\log n$-approximate algorithms for unweighted and weighted\ngraphs respectively with round complexity $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{n})$\nin $\\hybrid$, closely matching the performance of the state of the art\nrandomized algorithm of Kuhn and Schneider \\cite{10.1145/3382734.3405719}.\nMoreover, we make a connection with the Ghaffari-Haeupler framework of\nlow-congestion shortcuts \\cite{DBLP:conf/soda/GhaffariH16}, leading -- among\nothers -- to a $(1 + \\epsilon)$-approximate algorithm for Min-Cut after\n$\\log^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}n$ rounds, with high probability, even if we restrict\nlocal edges to transfer $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$-bits per round. Finally, we prove\nvia a reduction from the set disjointness problem that\n$\\widetilde{\\Omega}(n^{1/3})$ rounds are required to determine the radius of an\nunweighted graph, as well as a $(3/2 - \\epsilon)$-approximation for weighted\ngraphs.",

    "abstract": "Ellipsoids are a common representation for reachability analysis because they\nare closed under affine maps and allow conservative approximation of Minkowski\nsums; this enables one to incorporate uncertainty and linearization error in a\ndynamical system by exapnding the size of the reachable set. Zonotopes, a type\nof symmetric, convex polytope, are similarly frequently used due to efficient\nnumerical implementation of affine maps and exact Minkowski sums. Both of these\nrepresentations also enable efficient, convex collision detection for fault\ndetection or formal verification tasks, wherein one checks if the reachable set\nof a system collides (i.e., intersects) with an unsafe set. However, both\nrepresentations often result in conservative representations for reachable sets\nof arbitrary systems, and neither is closed under intersection. Recently,\nconstrained zonotopes and constrained polynomial zonotopes have been shown to\novercome some of these conservatism challenges, and are closed under\nintersection. However, constrained zonotopes can not represent shapes with\nsmooth boundaries such as ellipsoids, and constrained polynomial zonotopes can\nrequire solving a non-convex program for collision checking (i.e., fault\ndetection). This paper introduces ellipsotopes, a set representation that is\nclosed under affine maps, Minkowski sums, and intersections. Ellipsotopes\ncombine the advantages of ellipsoids and zonotopes, and enable convex collision\nchecking at the expense of more conservative reachable sets than constrained\npolynomial zonotopes. The utility of this representation is demonstrated on\nseveral examples.",

A natural extension of this LFA framework is the\nanalysis of h-multigrid for finite element discretizations or finite difference\ndiscretizations that can be represented in the language of finite elements.\nWith this extension, we can replicate previous work on the LFA of h-multigrid\nfor arbitrary order discretizations using a convenient and extensible\nabstraction.

Currently, most of the anomaly detection systems are\neither rule-based or trained using manually selected features. We propose\nutilizing modern unsupervised language representation model for embedding HTTP\nrequests and then using it to classify anomalies in the traffic.

    "abstract": "The standard approach to risk-averse control is to use the Exponential\nUtility (EU) functional, which has been studied for several decades. Like other\nrisk-averse utility functionals, EU encodes risk aversion through an increasing\nconvex mapping $\\varphi$ of objective costs to subjective costs. An objective\ncost is a realization $y$ of a random variable $Y$. In contrast, a subjective\ncost is a realization $\\varphi(y)$ of a random variable $\\varphi(Y)$ that has\nbeen transformed to measure preferences about the outcomes. For EU, the\ntransformation is $\\varphi(y) = \\exp(\\frac{-\\theta}{2}y)$, and under certain\nconditions, the quantity $\\varphi^{-1}(E(\\varphi(Y)))$ can be approximated by a\nlinear combination of the mean and variance of $Y$. More recently, there has\nbeen growing interest in risk-averse control using the Conditional\nValue-at-Risk (CVaR) functional. In contrast to the EU functional, the CVaR of\na random variable $Y$ concerns a fraction of its possible realizations. If $Y$\nis a continuous random variable with finite $E(|Y|)$, then the CVaR of $Y$ at\nlevel $\\alpha$ is the expectation of $Y$ in the $\\alpha \\cdot 100 \\%$ worst\ncases. Here, we study the applications of risk-averse functionals to controller\nsynthesis and safety analysis through the development of numerical examples,\nwith emphasis on EU and CVaR. Our contribution is to examine the\ndecision-theoretic, mathematical, and computational trade-offs that arise when\nusing EU and CVaR for optimal control and safety analysis.

    "abstract": "Amidst the climate crisis, the massive introduction of renewable energy\nsources has brought tremendous challenges to both the power grid and its\nsurrounding markets. As datacenters have become ever-larger and more powerful,\nthey play an increasingly significant role in the energy arena. With their\nunique characteristics, datacenters have been proved to be well-suited for\nregulating the power grid yet currently provide little, if any, such active\nresponse. This problem is due to issues such as unsuitability of the market\ndesign, high complexity of the currently proposed solutions, as well as the\npotential risks thereof. This work aims to provide individual datacenters with\ninsights on the feasibility and profitability of directly participating in the\nenergy market. By modelling the power system of datacenters, and by conducting\nsimulations on real-world datacenter traces, we demonstrate the substantial\nfinancial incentive for individual datacenters to directly participate in both\nthe day-ahead and the balancing markets. In turn, we suggest a new short-term,\ndirect scheme of market participation for individual datacenters in place of\nthe current long-term, inactive participation. Furthermore, we develop a novel\nproactive DVFS scheduling algorithm that can both reduce energy consumption and\nsave energy costs during the market participation of datacenters. Also, in\ndeveloping this scheduler, we propose an innovative combination of machine\nlearning methods and the DVFS technology that can provide the power grid with\nindirect demand response (DR). Our experimental results strongly support that\nindividual datacenters can and should directly participate in the energy market\nboth to save their energy costs and to curb their energy consumption, whilst\nproviding the power grid with indirect DR.",

    "abstract": "Attention-based transformer networks have demonstrated promising potential as\ntheir applications extend from natural language processing to vision. However,\ndespite the recent improvements, such as sub-quadratic attention approximation\nand various training enhancements, the compact vision transformers to date\nusing the regular attention still fall short in comparison with its convnet\ncounterparts, in terms of \\textit{accuracy,} \\textit{model size}, \\textit{and}\n\\textit{throughput}. This paper introduces a compact self-attention mechanism\nthat is fundamental and highly generalizable. The proposed method reduces\nredundancy and improves efficiency on top of the existing attention\noptimizations. We show its drop-in applicability for both the regular attention\nmechanism and some most recent variants in vision transformers. As a result, we\nproduced smaller and faster models with the same or better accuracies.",

    "abstract": "In neural circuits, recurrent connectivity plays a crucial role in network\nfunction and stability. However, existing recurrent spiking neural networks\n(RSNNs) are often constructed by random connections without optimization. While\nRSNNs can produce rich dynamics that are critical for memory formation and\nlearning, systemic architectural optimization of RSNNs is still an opening\nchallenge. We aim to enable systemic design of large RSNNs via a new scalable\nRSNN architecture and automated architectural optimization. We compose RSNNs\nbased on a layer architecture called Sparsely-Connected Recurrent Motif Layer\n(SC-ML) that consists of multiple small recurrent motifs wired together by\nsparse lateral connections. The small size of the motifs and sparse inter-motif\nconnectivity leads to an RSNN architecture scalable to large network sizes. We\nfurther propose a method called Hybrid Risk-Mitigating Architectural Search\n(HRMAS) to systematically optimize the topology of the proposed recurrent\nmotifs and SC-ML layer architecture. HRMAS is an alternating two-step\noptimization process by which we mitigate the risk of network instability and\nperformance degradation caused by architectural change by introducing a novel\nbiologically-inspired \"self-repairing\" mechanism through intrinsic plasticity.\nThe intrinsic plasticity is introduced to the second step of each HRMAS\niteration and acts as unsupervised fast self-adaption to structural and\nsynaptic weight modifications introduced by the first step during the RSNN\narchitectural \"evolution\". To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the\nfirst work that performs systematic architectural optimization of RSNNs. Using\none speech and three neuromorphic datasets, we demonstrate the significant\nperformance improvement brought by the proposed automated architecture\noptimization over existing manually-designed RSNNs.",

We propose a new deformation recovery and replanning strategy to\nhandle collisions that may occur at run-time. Contrary to collision avoidance\nmethods that generate trajectories only in conservative local space or require\ncollision checking that has high computational cost, our method directly\ngenerates (local) trajectories with imposing only waypoint constraints. If a\ncollision occurs, our method then estimates the post-impact state and computes\nfrom there an intermediate waypoint to recover from the collision. To achieve\nso, we develop two novel components: 1) a deformation recovery controller that\noptimizes the robot's states during post-impact recovery phase, and 2) a\npost-impact trajectory replanner that adjusts the next waypoint with the\ninformation from the collision for the robot to pass through and generates a\npolynomial-based minimum effort trajectory. The proposed strategy is evaluated\nexperimentally with an omni-directional impact-resilient wheeled robot. The\nrobot is designed in house, and it can perceive collisions with the aid of Hall\neffect sensors embodied between the robot's main chassis and a surrounding\ndeflection ring-like structure.",

    "abstract": "The latest trend in the bottom-up perspective for arbitrary-shape scene text\ndetection is to reason the links between text segments using Graph\nConvolutional Network (GCN). Notwithstanding, the performance of the best\nperforming bottom-up method is still inferior to that of the best performing\ntop-down method even with the help of GCN. We argue that this is not mainly\ncaused by the limited feature capturing ability of the text proposal backbone\nor GCN, but by their failure to make a full use of visual-relational features\nfor suppressing false detection, as well as the sub-optimal route-finding\nmechanism used for grouping text segments. In this paper, we revitalize the\nclassic text detection frameworks by aggregating the visual-relational features\nof text with two effective false positive/negative suppression mechanisms.\nFirst, dense overlapping text segments depicting the `characterness' and\n`streamline' of text are generated for further relational reasoning and weakly\nsupervised segment classification. Here, relational graph features are used for\nsuppressing false positives/negatives. Then, to fuse the relational features\nwith visual features, a Location-Aware Transfer (LAT) module is designed to\ntransfer text's relational features into visual compatible features with a Fuse\nDecoding (FD) module to enhance the representation of text regions for the\nsecond step suppression. Finally, a novel multiple-text-map-aware\ncontour-approximation strategy is developed, instead of the widely-used\nroute-finding process. Experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets, i.e.,\nCTW1500, Total-Text, ICDAR2015, MSRA-TD500, and MLT2017 demonstrate that our\nmethod outperforms the state-of-the-art performance when being embedded in a\nclassic text detection framework, which revitalises the superb strength of the\nbottom-up methods.",

For instance, presence of speech disfluencies might\nconfuse the post-processing system into tagging disfluent but accurate\ntranscriptions as ASR errors. Such confusion occurs because both error\ndetection and disfluency detection tasks attempt to identify tokens at\nstatistically unlikely positions.

There are methods modeling unified video\nsimilarity in an end-to-end way, but losing detailed partial alignment\ninformation, which causes the incapability of copy segments localization. To\naddress the above issues, we propose the Video Similarity and Alignment\nLearning (VSAL) approach, which jointly models spatial similarity, temporal\nsimilarity and partial alignment. To mitigate the spatial similarity bias, we\nmodel the temporal similarity as the mask map predicted from frame-level\nspatial similarity, where each element indicates the probability of frame pair\nlying right on the partial alignments. To further localize partial copies, the\nstep map is learned from the spatial similarity where the elements indicate\nextending directions of the current partial alignments on the spatial-temporal\nsimilarity map. Obtained from the mask map, the start points extend out into\npartial optimal alignments following instructions of the step map. With the\nsimilarity and alignment learning strategy, VSAL achieves the state-of-the-art\nF1-score on VCDB core dataset. Furthermore, we construct a new benchmark of\npartial video copy detection and localization by adding new segment-level\nannotations for FIVR-200k dataset, where VSAL also achieves the best\nperformance, verifying its effectiveness in more challenging situations.

    "abstract": "Human pose information is a critical component in many downstream image\nprocessing tasks, such as activity recognition and motion tracking. Likewise, a\npose estimator for the illustrated character domain would provide a valuable\nprior for assistive content creation tasks, such as reference pose retrieval\nand automatic character animation. But while modern data-driven techniques have\nsubstantially improved pose estimation performance on natural images, little\nwork has been done for illustrations. In our work, we bridge this domain gap by\nefficiently transfer-learning from both domain-specific and task-specific\nsource models. Additionally, we upgrade and expand an existing illustrated pose\nestimation dataset, and introduce two new datasets for classification and\nsegmentation subtasks. We then apply the resultant state-of-the-art character\npose estimator to solve the novel task of pose-guided illustration retrieval.\nAll data, models, and code will be made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Expressive neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems incorporate a style encoder to\nlearn a latent embedding as the style information. However, this embedding\nprocess may encode redundant textual information. This phenomenon is called\ncontent leakage. Researchers have attempted to resolve this problem by adding\nan ASR or other auxiliary supervision loss functions. In this study, we propose\nan unsupervised method called the \"information sieve\" to reduce the effect of\ncontent leakage in prosody transfer. The rationale of this approach is that the\nstyle encoder can be forced to focus on style information rather than on\ntextual information contained in the reference speech by a well-designed\ndownsample-upsample filter, i.e., the extracted style embeddings can be\ndownsampled at a certain interval and then upsampled by duplication.\nFurthermore, we used instance normalization in convolution layers to help the\nsystem learn a better latent style space. Objective metrics such as the\nsignificantly lower word error rate (WER) demonstrate the effectiveness of this\nmodel in mitigating content leakage. Listening tests indicate that the model\nretains its prosody transferability compared with the baseline models such as\nthe original GST-Tacotron and ASR-guided Tacotron.",

However, the transition\nprobabilities calculated from the dataset can be much different from the\ntransition probabilities induced by the learned policies of other agents,\ncreating large errors in value estimates. Moreover, the experience\ndistributions of agents' datasets may vary wildly due to diverse behavior\npolicies, causing large difference in value estimates between agents.\nConsequently, agents will learn uncoordinated suboptimal policies. In this\npaper, we propose MABCQ, which exploits value deviation and transition\nnormalization to modify the transition probabilities. Value deviation\noptimistically increases the transition probabilities of high-value next\nstates, and transition normalization normalizes the biased transition\nprobabilities of next states.

With real-time communication and precise motion\ncontrol, Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) provide an opportunity to\nsubstantially enhance the traffic operational performance of on-ramp\nbottlenecks. In this paper, we propose an upper-level control strategy to\ncoordinate the two traffic streams at on-ramp merging through proactive gap\ncreation and platoon formation. The coordination consists of three components:\n(1) mainline vehicles proactively decelerate to create large merging gaps; (2)\nramp vehicles form platoons before entering the main road; (3) the gaps created\non the main road and the platoons formed on the ramp are coordinated with each\nother in terms of size, speed, and arrival time. The coordination is formulated\nas a constrained optimization problem, incorporating both macroscopic and\nmicroscopic traffic flow models, for flow-level efficiency gains. The model\nuses traffic state parameters as inputs and determines the optimal coordination\nplan adaptive to real-time traffic conditions. The benefits of the proposed\ncoordination are demonstrated through an illustrative case study. Results show\nthat the coordination is compatible with real-world implementation and can\nsubstantially improve the overall efficiency of on-ramp merging, especially\nunder high traffic volume conditions, where recurrent traffic congestion is\nprevented, and merging throughput increased.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of adaptive path planning for accurate\nsemantic segmentation of terrain using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The\nusage of UAVs for terrain monitoring and remote sensing is rapidly gaining\nmomentum due to their high mobility, low cost, and flexible deployment.\nHowever, a key challenge is planning missions to maximize the value of acquired\ndata in large environments given flight time limitations. To address this, we\npropose an online planning algorithm which adapts the UAV paths to obtain\nhigh-resolution semantic segmentations necessary in areas on the terrain with\nfine details as they are detected in incoming images. This enables us to\nperform close inspections at low altitudes only where required, without wasting\nenergy on exhaustive mapping at maximum resolution. A key feature of our\napproach is a new accuracy model for deep learning-based architectures that\ncaptures the relationship between UAV altitude and semantic segmentation\naccuracy. We evaluate our approach on the application of crop/weed segmentation\nin precision agriculture using real-world field data.",

    "abstract": "Edge computing has emerged as a prospective paradigm to meet ever-increasing\ncomputation demands in Mobile Target Tracking Wireless Sensor Networks\n(MTT-WSN). This paradigm can offload time-sensitive tasks to sink nodes to\nimprove computing efficiency. Nevertheless, it is difficult to execute dynamic\nand critical tasks in the MTT-WSN network. Besides, the network cannot ensure\nconsecutive tracking due to the limited energy. To address the problems, this\npaper proposes a new hierarchical target tracking structure based on Edge\nIntelligence (EI) technology. The structure integrates the computing resource\nof both mobile nodes and edge servers to provide efficient computation\ncapability for real-time target tracking. Based on the proposed structure, we\nformulate an energy optimization model with the constrains of system execution\nlatency and trajectory prediction accuracy. Moreover, we propose a long-term\ndynamic resource allocation algorithm to obtain the optimal resource allocation\nsolution for the ac- curate and consecutive tracking. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the deep Q-learning over 14.5% in\nterms of system energy consumption.

However,\nextensive experiments have shown that, prominent neural architectures, such as\nResNet in computer vision and LSTM in natural language processing, are\ngenerally good at extracting patterns from the input data and perform well on\ndifferent downstream tasks. These observations inspire us to ask: Is it\nnecessary to use the performance of specific downstream tasks to evaluate and\nsearch for good neural architectures?

In this work, we\nattempt to affirmatively answer the above two questions and improve the\nstate-of-the-art NAS solution by proposing a novel and generic NAS framework,\ntermed Generic NAS (GenNAS). GenNAS does not use task-specific labels but\ninstead adopts \\textit{regression} on a set of manually designed synthetic\nsignal bases for architecture evaluation. Such a self-supervised regression\ntask can effectively evaluate the intrinsic power of an architecture to capture\nand transform the input signal patterns, and allow more sufficient usage of\ntraining samples. We then propose an automatic task search to optimize the\ncombination of synthetic signals using limited downstream-task-specific labels,\nfurther improving the performance of GenNAS.

FPB borrows\nthe idea of the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) from prevailing object detection\nmethods.

    "abstract": "The decentralized nature of federated learning, that often leverages the\npower of edge devices, makes it vulnerable to attacks against privacy and\nsecurity. The privacy risk for a peer is that the model update she computes on\nher private data may, when sent to the model manager, leak information on those\nprivate data. Even more obvious are security attacks, whereby one or several\nmalicious peers return wrong model updates in order to disrupt the learning\nprocess and lead to a wrong model being learned. In this paper we build a\nfederated learning framework that offers privacy to the participating peers as\nwell as security against Byzantine and poisoning attacks. Our framework\nconsists of several protocols that provide strong privacy to the participating\npeers via unlinkable anonymity and that are rationally sustainable based on the\nco-utility property. In other words, no rational party is interested in\ndeviating from the proposed protocols. We leverage the notion of co-utility to\nbuild a decentralized co-utile reputation management system that provides\nincentives for parties to adhere to the protocols. Unlike privacy protection\nvia differential privacy, our approach preserves the values of model updates\nand hence the accuracy of plain federated learning; unlike privacy protection\nvia update aggregation, our approach preserves the ability to detect bad model\nupdates while substantially reducing the computational overhead compared to\nmethods based on homomorphic encryption.",

    "abstract": "Age of information (AoI), a notion that measures the information freshness,\nis an essential performance measure for time-critical applications in Internet\nof Things (IoT). With the surge of computing resources at the IoT devices, it\nis possible to preprocess the information packets that contain the status\nupdate before sending them to the destination so as to alleviate the\ntransmission burden. However, the additional time and energy expenditure\ninduced by computing also make the optimal updating a non-trivial problem. In\nthis paper, we consider a time-critical IoT system, where the IoT device is\ncapable of preprocessing the status update before the transmission.\nParticularly, we aim to jointly design the preprocessing and transmission so\nthat the weighted sum of the average AoI of the destination and the energy\nconsumption of the IoT device is minimized. Due to the heterogeneity in\ntransmission and computation capacities, the durations of distinct actions of\nthe IoT device are non-uniform. Therefore, we formulate the status updating\nproblem as an infinite horizon average cost semi-Markov decision process (SMDP)\nand then transform it into a discrete-time Markov decision process. We\ndemonstrate that the optimal policy is of threshold type with respect to the\nAoI. Equipped with this, a structure-aware relative policy iteration algorithm\nis proposed to obtain the optimal policy of the SMDP. Our analysis shows that\npreprocessing is more beneficial in regimes of high AoIs, given it can reduce\nthe time required for updates. We further prove the switching structure of the\noptimal policy in a special scenario, where the status updates are transmitted\nover a reliable channel, and derive the optimal threshold. Finally, simulation\nresults demonstrate the efficacy of preprocessing and show that the proposed\npolicy outperforms two baseline policies.",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of textual content is unstructured, making automated\nclassification an important task for many applications. The goal of text\nclassification is to automatically classify text documents into one or more\npredefined categories. Recently proposed simple architectures for text\nclassification such as Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence\nClassification by Kim, Yoon showed promising results. In this paper, we propose\nincorporating an attention mechanism into the network to boost its performance,\nwe also propose WordRank for vocabulary selection to reduce the network\nembedding parameters and speed up training with minimum accuracy loss. By\nadopting the proposed ideas TextCNN accuracy on 20News increased from 94.79 to\n96.88, moreover, the number of parameters for the embedding layer can be\nreduced substantially with little accuracy loss by using WordRank. By using\nWordRank for vocabulary selection we can reduce the number of parameters by\nmore than 5x from 7.9M to 1.5M, and the accuracy will only decrease by 1.2%.",

On the one hand, the programing models\nand interfaces differ a lot in the existing systems, leading to high learning\ncosts and program migration costs. On the other hand, these graph processing\nsystems are tightly bound to the underlying distributed computing platforms,\nrequiring users to be familiar with distributed computing. To improve the\nusability of distributed graph processing, we propose a unified distributed\ngraph programming framework UniGPS. Firstly, we propose a unified\ncross-platform graph programming model VCProg for UniGPS. VCProg hides details\nof distributed computing from users. It is compatible with the popular graph\nprogramming models Pregel, GAS, and Push-Pull. VCProg programs can be executed\nby compatible distributed graph processing systems without modification,\nreducing the learning overheads of users. Secondly, UniGPS supports Python as\nthe programming language. We propose an interprocess-communication-based\nexecution environment isolation mechanism to enable Java/C++-based systems to\ncall user-defined methods written in Python. The experimental results show that\nUniGPS enables users to process big graphs beyond the memory capacity of a\nsingle machine without sacrificing usability.

To access the knowledge\nstored in mask-based LMs, we can use cloze-style questions and let the model\nfill in the blank. The flexibility advantage over structured knowledge bases\ncomes with the drawback of finding the right query for a certain information\nneed. Inspired by human behavior to disambiguate a question, we propose to\nquery LMs by example. To clarify the ambivalent question \"Who does Neuer play\nfor?\", a successful strategy is to demonstrate the relation using another\nsubject, e.g., \"Ronaldo plays for Portugal. Who does Neuer play for?\". We apply\nthis approach of querying by example to the LAMA probe and obtain substantial\nimprovements of up to 37.8% for BERT-large on the T-REx data when providing\nonly 10 demonstrations--even outperforming a baseline that queries the model\nwith up to 40 paraphrases of the question. The examples are provided through\nthe model's context and thus require neither fine-tuning nor an additional\nforward pass. This suggests that LMs contain more factual and commonsense\nknowledge than previously assumed--if we query the model in the right way.",

The log parsing\nerrors could cause the loss of important information for anomaly detection. To\naddress the limitations of existing methods, we propose NeuralLog, a novel\nlog-based anomaly detection approach that does not require log parsing.\nNeuralLog extracts the semantic meaning of raw log messages and represents them\nas semantic vectors. These representation vectors are then used to detect\nanomalies through a Transformer-based classification model, which can capture\nthe contextual information from log sequences. Our experimental results show\nthat the proposed approach can effectively understand the semantic meaning of\nlog messages and achieve accurate anomaly detection results.

    "abstract": "Video anomaly detection (VAD) has constantly been a vital topic in video\nanalysis. As anomalies are often rare, it is typically addressed under a\nsemi-supervised setup, which requires a training set with pure normal videos.\nTo avoid exhausted manual labeling, we are inspired by how humans sense\nanomalies and propose a hominine framework that enables both unsupervised and\nend-to-end VAD. The framework is based on two key observations: 1) Human\nperception is usually local, i.e. focusing on local foreground and its context\nwhen sensing anomalies. Thus, we propose to impose locality-awareness by\nlocalizing foreground with generic knowledge, and a region localization\nstrategy is designed to exploit local context. 2) Frequently-occurred events\nwill mould humans' definition of normality, which motivates us to devise a\nsurrogate training paradigm. It trains a deep neural network (DNN) to learn a\nsurrogate task with unlabeled videos, and frequently-occurred events will play\na dominant role in \"moulding\" the DNN. In this way, a training loss gap will\nautomatically manifest rarely-seen novel events as anomalies. For\nimplementation, we explore various surrogate tasks as well as both classic and\nemerging DNN models. Extensive evaluations on commonly-used VAD benchmarks\njustify the framework's applicability to different surrogate tasks or DNN\nmodels, and demonstrate its astonishing effectiveness: It not only outperforms\nexisting unsupervised solutions by a wide margin (8% to 10% AUROC gain), but\nalso achieves comparable or even superior performance to state-of-the-art\nsemi-supervised counterparts.",

Despite recent advances,\nunderstanding the intricate implications of microarchitectural design decisions\non processor security remains a great challenge and has caused a number of\nupdate cycles in the past. number of update cycles in the past. This papers\naddresses the need for a new approach to HW sign-off verification which\nguarantees the security of processors at the Register Transfer Level (RTL). To\nthis end, we introduce a formal definition of security with respect to\ntransient execution attacks, formulated as a HW property. We present a formal\nproof methodology based on Unique Program Execution Checking (UPEC) which can\nbe used to systematically detect all vulnerabilities to transient execution\nattacks in RTL designs. UPEC does not exploit any a priori knowledge on known\nattacks and can therefore detect also vulnerabilities based on new, so far\nunknown, types of channels. This is demonstrated by two new attack scenarios\ndiscovered in our experiments with UPEC. UPEC scales to a wide range of HW\ndesigns, including in-order processors (RocketChip), pipelines with\nout-of-order writeback (Ariane), and processors with deep out-of-order\nspeculative execution (BOOM). To the best of our knowledge, UPEC is the first\nRTL verification technique that exhaustively covers transient execution side\nchannels in processors of realistic complexity.",

Most\nexisting methods jointly train the depth and pose networks by photometric\nconsistency of adjacent frames based on the principle of structure-from-motion\n(SFM). However, the coupling relationship of the depth and pose networks\nseriously influences the learning performance, and the re-projection relations\nis sensitive to scale ambiguity, especially for pose learning. In this paper,\nwe aim to improve the depth-pose learning performance without the auxiliary\ntasks and address the above issues by alternative training each task and\nincorporating the epipolar geometric constraints into the Iterative Closest\nPoint (ICP) based point clouds match process. Distinct from jointly training\nthe depth and pose networks, our key idea is to better utilize the mutual\ndependency of these two tasks by alternatively training each network with\nrespective losses while fixing the other. We also design a log-scale 3D\nstructural consistency loss to put more emphasis on the smaller depth values\nduring training. To makes the optimization easier, we further incorporate the\nepipolar geometry into the ICP based learning process for pose learning.\nExtensive experiments on various benchmarks datasets indicate the superiority\nof our algorithm over the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods.",

In contrast, for\nfinite domains, there has been recent works on sparse alternatives to softmax\n(e.g. sparsemax, $\\alpha$-entmax, and fusedmax) and corresponding losses, which\nhave varying support.\nThis paper expands that line of work in several directions: first, it extends\n$\\Omega$-regularized prediction maps and Fenchel-Young losses to arbitrary\ndomains (possibly countably infinite or continuous). For linearly parametrized\nfamilies, we show that minimization of Fenchel-Young losses is equivalent to\nmoment matching of the statistics, generalizing a fundamental property of\nexponential families. When $\\Omega$ is a Tsallis negentropy with parameter\n$\\alpha$, we obtain \"deformed exponential families,\" which include\n$\\alpha$-entmax and sparsemax ($\\alpha$ = 2) as particular cases. For quadratic\nenergy functions in continuous domains, the resulting densities are\n$\\beta$-Gaussians, an instance of elliptical distributions that contain as\nparticular cases the Gaussian, biweight, triweight and Epanechnikov densities,\nand for which we derive closed-form expressions for the variance, Tsallis\nentropy, and Fenchel-Young loss.

The theorem applies to the anonymous\nvariant of the LOCAL model, in graphs with sufficiently large girth, and to\nlocally checkable labeling (LCL) tasks. In this paper, using combinatorial\ntopology applied to distributed computing, we dissect the construction in\nBrandt's speedup theorem for expressing it in the broader framework of\nround-based models supporting full information protocols, which includes models\nas different as wait-free shared-memory computing with iterated immediate\nsnapshots, and synchronous failure-free network computing. In particular, we\nprovide general definitions for notions such as local checkability and local\nindependence, in our broader framework. In this way, we are able to identify\nthe hypotheses on the computing model, and on the tasks, that are sufficient\nfor Brandt's speedup theorem to apply. More precisely, we identify which\nhypotheses are sufficient for the each direction of the if-and-only-if\ncondition. Interestingly, these hypotheses are of different natures. Our\ngeneral approach enables to extend Brandt's speedup theorem from LOCAL to\ndirected networks, to hypergraphs, to dynamic networks, and even to graphs\nincluding short cyclic dependencies between processes (i.e., the large girth\ncondition is, to some extend, not necessary). The theorem can even be extended\nto shared-memory wait-free computing. In particular, we provide new\nimpossibility proofs for consensus and perfect renaming in 2-process systems.",

WCET is available to us in the last stage of systems development when\nthe hardware is available and the application code is compiled on it.

This\nmodel predicts the WCET based on the source code without compiling and running\non the hardware architecture. Our WCET prediction model is created using the\nPytorch framework.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial\nexamples. Applications of ML to voice biometrics authentication are no\nexception. Yet, the implications of audio adversarial examples on these\nreal-world systems remain poorly understood given that most research targets\nlimited defenders who can only listen to the audio samples. Conflating\ndetectability of an attack with human perceptibility, research has focused on\nmethods that aim to produce imperceptible adversarial examples which humans\ncannot distinguish from the corresponding benign samples. We argue that this\nperspective is coarse for two reasons: 1. Imperceptibility is impossible to\nverify; it would require an experimental process that encompasses variations in\nlistener training, equipment, volume, ear sensitivity, types of background\nnoise etc, and 2. It disregards pipeline-based detection clues that realistic\ndefenders leverage. This results in adversarial examples that are ineffective\nin the presence of knowledgeable defenders. Thus, an adversary only needs an\naudio sample to be plausible to a human. We thus introduce surreptitious\nadversarial examples, a new class of attacks that evades both human and\npipeline controls. In the white-box setting, we instantiate this class with a\njoint, multi-stage optimization attack. Using an Amazon Mechanical Turk user\nstudy, we show that this attack produces audio samples that are more\nsurreptitious than previous attacks that aim solely for imperceptibility.\nLastly we show that surreptitious adversarial examples are challenging to\ndevelop in the black-box setting.",

    "title": "Backscatter Communication System With Dumb Diffusing Surface",
    "abstract": "Ambient backscatter communications have been identified for ultra-low energy\nwireless communications. Indeed, a tag can send a message to a reader without\nemitting any wave and without battery, simply by backscattering the waves\ngenerated by a source. In the simplest implementation of such a system, the tag\nsends a binary message by oscillating between two states and the reader detects\nthe bits by comparing the two distinct received powers. In this paper, for the\nfirst time, we propose to study an ambient backscatter communication system, in\nthe presence of a diffusing surface, a simple flat panel that diffuses in all\ndirections. We establish the analytical closed form expression of the power\ncontrast in the presence of the surface. We show that the diffusing surface\nimproves the power contrast. Moreover our approach allows us to express the\ncontrast to noise ratio, and therefore to establish the BER performance.\nFurthermore, we derive the optimum source transmit power for a given target\npower contrast. This makes it possible to quantify the amount of energy that\ncan be saved at the source side, thanks to the diffusing surface.",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) are an emerging computation model, which uses\nevent-driven activation and bio-inspired learning algorithms. SNN-based\nmachine-learning programs are typically executed on tile- based neuromorphic\nhardware platforms, where each tile consists of a computation unit called\ncrossbar, which maps neurons and synapses of the program. However, synthesizing\nsuch programs on an off-the-shelf neuromorphic hardware is challenging. This is\nbecause of the inherent resource and latency limitations of the hardware, which\nimpact both model performance, e.g., accuracy, and hardware performance, e.g.,\nthroughput. We propose DFSynthesizer, an end-to-end framework for synthesizing\nSNN-based machine learning programs to neuromorphic hardware. The proposed\nframework works in four steps. First, it analyzes a machine-learning program\nand generates SNN workload using representative data. Second, it partitions the\nSNN workload and generates clusters that fit on crossbars of the target\nneuromorphic hardware. Third, it exploits the rich semantics of Synchronous\nDataflow Graph (SDFG) to represent a clustered SNN program, allowing for\nperformance analysis in terms of key hardware constraints such as number of\ncrossbars, dimension of each crossbar, buffer space on tiles, and tile\ncommunication bandwidth. Finally, it uses a novel scheduling algorithm to\nexecute clusters on crossbars of the hardware, guaranteeing hardware\nperformance. We evaluate DFSynthesizer with 10 commonly used machine-learning\nprograms. Our results demonstrate that DFSynthesizer provides much tighter\nperformance guarantee compared to current mapping approaches.",

    "abstract": "Traditional approaches for Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping\n(VSLAM) rely on low-level vision information for state estimation, such as\nhandcrafted local features or the image gradient. While significant progress\nhas been made through this track, under more challenging configuration for\nmonocular VSLAM, e.g., varying illumination, the performance of\nstate-of-the-art systems generally degrades. As a consequence, robustness and\naccuracy for monocular VSLAM are still widely concerned. This paper presents a\nmonocular VSLAM system that fully exploits learnt features for better state\nestimation. The proposed system leverages both learnt local features and global\nembeddings at different modules of the system: direct camera pose estimation,\ninter-frame feature association, and loop closure detection. With a\nprobabilistic explanation of keypoint prediction, we formulate the camera pose\ntracking in a direct manner and parameterize local features with uncertainty\ntaken into account. To alleviate the quantization effect, we adapt the mapping\nmodule to generate 3D landmarks better to guarantee the system's robustness.\nDetecting temporal loop closure via deep global embeddings further improves the\nrobustness and accuracy of the proposed system. The proposed system is\nextensively evaluated on public datasets (Tsukuba, EuRoC, and KITTI), and\ncompared against the state-of-the-art methods.

Particularly, previous studies\nsuggest that prompt-tuning has remarkable superiority in the low-data scenario\nover the generic fine-tuning methods with extra classifiers. The core idea of\nprompt-tuning is to insert text pieces, i.e., template, to the input and\ntransform a classification problem into a masked language modeling problem,\nwhere a crucial step is to construct a projection, i.e., verbalizer, between a\nlabel space and a label word space. A verbalizer is usually handcrafted or\nsearched by gradient descent, which may lack coverage and bring considerable\nbias and high variances to the results. In this work, we focus on incorporating\nexternal knowledge into the verbalizer, forming a knowledgeable prompt-tuning\n(KPT), to improve and stabilize prompt-tuning. Specifically, we expand the\nlabel word space of the verbalizer using external knowledge bases (KBs) and\nrefine the expanded label word space with the PLM itself before predicting with\nthe expanded label word space. Extensive experiments on zero and few-shot text\nclassification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of knowledgeable\nprompt-tuning.",

One\nsuch problem is Connectivity Augmentation, where the goal is to cheaply\nincrease the connectivity of a network from a value k to k+1.\nThe most studied setting focuses on edge-connectivity, which reduces to k=2,\ncalled Cactus Augmentation. From an approximation perspective, Byrka, Grandoni,\nand Jabal Ameli (2020) were the first to break the 2-approximation barrier for\nthis problem, by exploiting a connection to the Steiner Tree problem, and by\ntailoring the analysis of the iterative randomized rounding technique for\nSteiner Tree to the specific instances arising from this connection. Recently,\nNutov (2020) observed that a similar reduction to Steiner Tree holds for a\nnode-connectivity problem called Block-Tree Augmentation, where the goal is to\nadd edges to a given spanning tree so that the resulting graph\n2-node-connected. Combining Nutov's result with the algorithm of Byrka,\nGrandoni, and Jabal Ameli yields a 1.91-approximation for Block-Tree\nAugmentation, that is the best bound known so far.\nIn this work, we give a 1.892-approximation algorithm for the problem of\naugmenting the node-connectivity of any graph from 1 to 2. As a corollary, we\nimprove upon the state-of-the-art approximation factor for Block-Tree\nAugmentation. Our result is obtained by developing a different and simpler\nanalysis of the iterative randomized rounding technique. Our results also imply\na 1.892-approximation algorithm for Cactus Augmentation. While this does not\nbeat the best approximation by Cecchetto, Traub, and Zenklusen (2021) known for\nthis problem, our analysis is quite simple compared to previous results in the\nliterature. In addition, our work gives new insights on the iterative\nrandomized rounding method, that might be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "In the age of big data and machine learning, at a time when the techniques\nand methods of software development are evolving rapidly, a problem has arisen:\nprogrammers can no longer detect all the security flaws and vulnerabilities in\ntheir code manually. To overcome this problem, developers can now rely on\nautomatic techniques, like machine learning based prediction models, to detect\nsuch issues. An inherent property of such approaches is that they work with\nnumeric vectors (i.e., feature vectors) as inputs. Therefore, one needs to\ntransform the source code into such feature vectors, often referred to as code\nembedding. A popular approach for code embedding is to adapt natural language\nprocessing techniques, like text representation, to automatically derive the\nnecessary features from the source code. However, the suitability and\ncomparison of different text representation techniques for solving Software\nEngineering (SE) problems is rarely studied systematically. In this paper, we\npresent a comparative study on three popular text representation methods,\nword2vec, fastText, and BERT applied to the SE task of detecting\nvulnerabilities in Python code. Using a data mining approach, we collected a\nlarge volume of Python source code in both vulnerable and fixed forms that we\nembedded with word2vec, fastText, and BERT to vectors and used a Long\nShort-Term Memory network to train on them. Using the same LSTM architecture,\nwe could compare the efficiency of the different embeddings in deriving\nmeaningful feature vectors. Our findings show that all the text representation\nmethods are suitable for code representation in this particular task, but the\nBERT model is the most promising as it is the least time consuming and the LSTM\nmodel based on it achieved the best overall accuracy(93.8%) in predicting\nPython source code vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "Process mining techniques including process discovery, conformance checking,\nand process enhancement provide extensive knowledge about processes.\nDiscovering running processes and deviations as well as detecting performance\nproblems and bottlenecks are well-supported by process mining tools. However,\nall the provided techniques represent the past/current state of the process.\nThe improvement in a process requires insights into the future states of the\nprocess w.r.t. the possible actions/changes. In this paper, we present a new\ntool that enables process owners to extract all the process aspects from their\nhistorical event data automatically, change these aspects, and re-run the\nprocess automatically using an interface. The combination of process mining and\nsimulation techniques provides new evidence-driven ways to explore \"what-if\"\nquestions. Therefore, assessing the effects of changes in process improvement\nis also possible. Our Python-based web-application provides a complete\ninteractive platform to improve the flow of activities, i.e., process tree,\nalong with possible changes in all the derived activity, resource, and process\nparameters. These parameters are derived directly from an event log without\nuser-background knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Vision videos are established for soliciting feedback and stimulating\ndiscussions in requirements engineering (RE) practices, such as focus groups.\nDifferent researchers motivated the transfer of these benefits into crowd-based\nRE (CrowdRE) by using vision videos on social media platforms. So far, however,\nlittle research explored the potential of using vision videos for CrowdRE in\ndetail. In this paper, we analyze and assess this potential, in particular,\nfocusing on video comments as a source of feedback. In a case study, we\nanalyzed 4505 comments on a vision video from YouTube. We found that the video\nsolicited 2770 comments from 2660 viewers in four days. This is more than 50%\nof all comments the video received in four years. Even though only a certain\nfraction of these comments are relevant to RE, the relevant comments address\ntypical intentions and topics of user feedback, such as feature request or\nproblem report. Besides the typical user feedback categories, we found more\nthan 300 comments that address the topic safety, which has not appeared in\nprevious analyses of user feedback. In an automated analysis, we compared the\nperformance of three machine learning algorithms on classifying the video\ncomments. Despite certain differences, the algorithms classified the video\ncomments well. Based on these findings, we conclude that the use of vision\nvideos for CrowdRE has a large potential. Despite the preliminary nature of the\ncase study, we are optimistic that vision videos can motivate stakeholders to\nactively participate in a crowd and solicit numerous of video comments as a\nvaluable source of feedback.",

    "abstract": "Sharing trajectories is beneficial for many real-world applications, such as\nmanaging disease spread through contact tracing and tailoring public services\nto a population's travel patterns. However, public concern over privacy and\ndata protection has limited the extent to which this data is shared. Local\ndifferential privacy enables data sharing in which users share a perturbed\nversion of their data, but existing mechanisms fail to incorporate\nuser-independent public knowledge (e.g., business locations and opening times,\npublic transport schedules, geo-located tweets). This limitation makes\nmechanisms too restrictive, gives unrealistic outputs, and ultimately leads to\nlow practical utility. To address these concerns, we propose a local\ndifferentially private mechanism that is based on perturbing\nhierarchically-structured, overlapping $n$-grams (i.e., contiguous subsequences\nof length $n$) of trajectory data. Our mechanism uses a multi-dimensional\nhierarchy over publicly available external knowledge of real-world places of\ninterest to improve the realism and utility of the perturbed, shared\ntrajectories. Importantly, including real-world public data does not negatively\naffect privacy or efficiency. Our experiments, using real-world data and a\nrange of queries, each with real-world application analogues, demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our approach over a range of alternative methods.",

    "abstract": "Sharing sensitive data is vital in enabling many modern data analysis and\nmachine learning tasks. However, current methods for data release are\ninsufficiently accurate or granular to provide meaningful utility, and they\ncarry a high risk of deanonymization or membership inference attacks. In this\npaper, we propose a differentially private synthetic data generation solution\nwith a focus on the compelling domain of location data. We present two methods\nwith high practical utility for generating synthetic location data from real\nlocations, both of which protect the existence and true location of each\nindividual in the original dataset. Our first, partitioning-based approach\nintroduces a novel method for privately generating point data using kernel\ndensity estimation, in addition to employing private adaptations of classic\nstatistical techniques, such as clustering, for private partitioning. Our\nsecond, network-based approach incorporates public geographic information, such\nas the road network of a city, to constrain the bounds of synthetic data points\nand hence improve the accuracy of the synthetic data. Both methods satisfy the\nrequirements of differential privacy, while also enabling accurate generation\nof synthetic data that aims to preserve the distribution of the real locations.\nWe conduct experiments using three large-scale location datasets to show that\nthe proposed solutions generate synthetic location data with high utility and\nstrong similarity to the real datasets. We highlight some practical\napplications for our work by applying our synthetic data to a range of location\nanalytics queries, and we demonstrate that our synthetic data produces\nnear-identical answers to the same queries compared to when real data is used.\nOur results show that the proposed approaches are practical solutions for\nsharing and analyzing sensitive location data privately.",

    "abstract": "A key question in the analysis of sociological processes on networks is to\nidentify pairs of individuals who have strong or weak social ties. Existing\napproaches mathematically model the social network as a graph, and tie strength\nis often inferred by examining the number of shared neighbors between\nindividuals, or equivalently, the number of triangles in the graph which\ncontain a specific pair of individuals. However, this approach misses out on\ncritical information because it does not distinguish the case where\ninteractions occur among groups involving more than two individuals. In this\nwork, we measure tie strength by explicitly accounting for these higher order\ninteractions in the network, through the use of a new measure called Edge\nPageRank. We show how Edge PageRank can be interpreted as the steady-state\noutcome of a dynamic, message-passing social process that characterizes the\nstrength of weak ties by appropriately discounting the effect of higher-order\ninteractions involving three individuals. Empirically, we find that Edge\nPageRank outperforms standard measures in identifying tie strength in several\nlarge-scale social networks. These results provide a new perspective on tie\nstrength and demonstrate the importance of incorporating higher-order\ninteractions in social network analysis.",

One promising technique to\nobtain an accurate yet lightweight pose estimator is knowledge distillation,\nwhich distills the pose knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a\nless-parameterized student model.

Instead of simply averaging the heatmaps, FAU which consists of\nmultiple parallel transformations with different receptive fields, leverages\nthe multi-scale information, thus obtains target heatmaps with higher-quality.\nSpecifically, the pixel-wise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is utilized to\nminimize the discrepancy between the target heatmaps and the predicted ones,\nwhich enables the student network to learn the implicit keypoint relationship.\nBesides, an unbalanced OKDHP scheme is introduced to customize the student\nnetworks with different compression rates.

However, the lack of proper co-saliency and the absence\nof multiple foreground objects in these datasets can lead to spurious\nvariations and inherent biases learned by models.

One approach to reduce the communication cost is to\ncompress the gradient during communication.

Recent work addressed this problem for\nstochastic gradient descent by adding back the compression error from the\nprevious step. This idea was further extended to one class of variance reduced\nalgorithms, where the variance of the stochastic gradient is reduced by taking\na moving average over all history gradients.

Most current methods rely on massive labelled data for training. We here\npropose a point discriminative learning method for unsupervised representation\nlearning on 3D point clouds, which can learn local and global geometry\nfeatures. We achieve this by imposing a novel point discrimination loss on the\nmiddle level and global level point features produced in the backbone network.\nThis point discrimination loss enforces the features to be consistent with\npoints belonging to the shape surface and inconsistent with randomly sampled\nnoisy points. Our method is simple in design, which works by adding an extra\nadaptation module and a point consistency module for unsupervised training of\nthe encoder in the backbone network. Once trained, these two modules can be\ndiscarded during supervised training of the classifier or decoder for\ndown-stream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on 3D object\nclassification, 3D part segmentation and shape reconstruction in various\nunsupervised and transfer settings. Both quantitative and qualitative results\nshow that our method learns powerful representations and achieves new\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "Consider a set of jobs connected to a directed acyclic task graph with a\nfixed source and sink. The edges of this graph model precedence constraints and\nthe jobs have to be scheduled with respect to those. We introduce the Server\nCloud Scheduling problem, in which the jobs have to be processed either on a\nsingle local machine or on one of many cloud machines. Both the source and the\nsink have to be scheduled on the local machine. For each job, processing times\nboth on the server and in the cloud are given. Furthermore, for each edge in\nthe task graph, a communication delay is included in the input and has to be\ntaken into account if one of the two jobs is scheduled on the server, the other\nin the cloud. The server can process jobs sequentially, whereas the cloud can\nserve as many as needed in parallel, but induces costs. We consider both\nmakespan and cost minimization. The main results are an FPTAS with respect for\nthe makespan objective for a fairly general case and strong hardness for the\ncase with unit processing times and delays.",

    "abstract": "Many real-world complex systems can be described as graphs. For a large-scale\ngraph with low sparsity, a node's adjacency vector is a long and sparse\nrepresentation, limiting the practical utilization of existing machine learning\nmethods on nodal features. In practice, graph embedding (graph representation\nlearning) attempts to learn a lower-dimensional representation vector for each\nnode or the whole graph while maintaining the most basic information of graph.\nSince various machine learning methods can efficiently process\nlower-dimensional vectors, graph embedding has recently attracted a lot of\nattention. However, most node embedding or whole graph embedding methods suffer\nfrom the problem of having more sophisticated methodology, hyperparameter\noptimization, and low explainability. This paper proposes a\nhyperparameter-free, extensible, and explainable whole graph embedding method,\ncombining the DHC (Degree, H-index and Coreness) theorem and Shannon Entropy\n(E), abbreviated as DHC-E. The new whole graph embedding scheme can obtain a\ntrade-off between the simplicity and the quality under some supervised\nclassification learning tasks, using molecular, social, and brain networks. In\naddition, the proposed approach has a good performance in lower-dimensional\ngraph visualization. The new methodology is overall simple,\nhyperparameter-free, extensible, and explainable for whole graph embedding with\npromising potential for exploring graph classification, prediction, and\nlower-dimensional graph visualization.",

    "abstract": "3D asymmetric tensor fields have found many applications in science and\nengineering domains, such as fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. 3D asymmetric\ntensors can have complex eigenvalues, which makes their analysis and\nvisualization more challenging than 3D symmetric tensors. Existing research in\ntensor field visualization focuses on 2D asymmetric tensor fields and 3D\nsymmetric tensor fields. In this paper, we address the analysis and\nvisualization of 3D asymmetric tensor fields. We introduce six topological\nsurfaces and one topological curve, which lead to an eigenvalue space based on\nthe tensor mode that we define. In addition, we identify several\nnon-topological feature surfaces that are nonetheless physically important.\nIncluded in our analysis are the realizations that triple degenerate tensors\nare structurally stable and form curves, unlike the case for 3D symmetric\ntensors fields. Furthermore, there are two different ways of measuring the\nrelative strengths of rotation and angular deformation in the tensor fields,\nunlike the case for 2D asymmetric tensor fields. We extract these feature\nsurfaces using the A-patches algorithm. However, since three of our feature\nsurfaces are quadratic, we develop a method to extract quadratic surfaces at\nany given accuracy. To facilitate the analysis of eigenvector fields, we\nvisualize a hyperstreamline as a tree stem with the other two eigenvectors\nrepresented as thorns in the real domain or the dual-eigenvectors as leaves in\nthe complex domain. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our analysis and\nvisualization, we apply our approach to datasets from solid mechanics and fluid\ndynamics.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent breakthroughs in deep learning methods for image lighting\nenhancement, they are inferior when applied to portraits because 3D facial\ninformation is ignored in their models. To address this, we present a novel\ndeep learning framework for portrait lighting enhancement based on 3D facial\nguidance. Our framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, corrected\nlighting parameters are predicted by a network from the input bad lighting\nimage, with the assistance of a 3D morphable model and a differentiable\nrenderer. Given the predicted lighting parameter, the differentiable renderer\nrenders a face image with corrected shading and texture, which serves as the 3D\nguidance for learning image lighting enhancement in the second stage. To better\nexploit the long-range correlations between the input and the guidance, in the\nsecond stage, we design an image-to-image translation network with a novel\ntransformer architecture, which automatically produces a lighting-enhanced\nresult. Experimental results on the FFHQ dataset and in-the-wild images show\nthat the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both\nquantitative metrics and visual quality.

To solve\nthis problem, reverse curriculum generation (RCG) provides a reverse expansion\napproach that automatically generates a curriculum for the agent to learn. More\nspecifically, RCG adapts the initial state distribution from the neighborhood\nof a goal to a distance as training proceeds. However, the initial state\ndistribution generated for each iteration might be biased, thus making the\npolicy overfit or slowing down the reverse expansion rate. While training RCG\nfor actor-critic (AC) based RL algorithms, this poor generalization and slow\nconvergence might be induced by the tight coupling between an AC pair.\nTherefore, we propose a parallelized approach that simultaneously trains\nmultiple AC pairs and periodically exchanges their critics.

However, configuring these mechanisms to provide a\nhigh resilience against multiple failures while avoiding congestion along\nfailover routes is algorithmically challenging, as the rerouting rules can only\ndepend on local failure information and must be defined ahead of time.

Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ describing a\nClos topology, our algorithm defines local routing rules for each node $v\\in\nV$, which only depend on the packet's destination and are conditioned on the\nincident link failures. We prove that as long as number of failures at each\nnode does not exceed a certain bound, our algorithm achieves an asymptotically\nminimal congestion up to polyloglog factors along failover paths.

Here, users often listen to the same\ntrack repeatedly and appreciate recommendations of the same song multiple\ntimes. Thus, accounting for users' relistening behavior is critical for music\nrecommender systems. In this paper, we describe a psychology-informed approach\nto model and predict music relistening behavior that is inspired by studies in\nmusic psychology, which relate music preferences to human memory. We adopt a\nwell-established psychological theory of human cognition that models the\noperations of human memory, i.e., Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R).\nIn contrast to prior work, which uses only the base-level component of ACT-R,\nwe utilize five components of ACT-R, i.e., base-level, spreading, partial\nmatching, valuation, and noise, to investigate the effect of five factors on\nmusic relistening behavior: (i) recency and frequency of prior exposure to\ntracks, (ii) co-occurrence of tracks, (iii) the similarity between tracks, (iv)\nfamiliarity with tracks, and (v) randomness in behavior. On a dataset of 1.7\nmillion listening events from Last.fm, we evaluate the performance of our\napproach by sequentially predicting the next track(s) in user sessions. We find\nthat recency and frequency of prior exposure to tracks is an effective\npredictor of relistening behavior. Besides, considering the co-occurrence of\ntracks and familiarity with tracks further improves performance in terms of\nR-precision.

To apply it to real-time monitoring, a system needs\nnot only to describe events accurately but also to produce the captions as soon\nas possible. Low-latency captioning is needed to realize such functionality,\nbut this research area for online video captioning has not been pursued yet.\nThis paper proposes a novel approach to optimize each caption's output timing\nbased on a trade-off between latency and caption quality. An audio-visual\nTrans-former is trained to generate ground-truth captions using only a small\nportion of all video frames, and to mimic outputs of a pre-trained Transformer\nto which all the frames are given. A CNN-based timing detector is also trained\nto detect a proper output timing, where the captions generated by the two\nTrans-formers become sufficiently close to each other. With the jointly trained\nTransformer and timing detector, a caption can be generated in the early stages\nof an event-triggered video clip, as soon as an event happens or when it can be\nforecasted. Experiments with the ActivityNet Captions dataset show that our\napproach achieves 94% of the caption quality of the upper bound given by the\npre-trained Transformer using the entire video clips, using only 28% of frames\nfrom the beginning.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying uncertainty in medical image segmentation applications is\nessential, as it is often connected to vital decision-making. Compelling\nattempts have been made in quantifying the uncertainty in image segmentation\narchitectures, e.g. to learn a density segmentation model conditioned on the\ninput image. Typical work in this field restricts these learnt densities to be\nstrictly Gaussian. In this paper, we propose to use a more flexible approach by\nintroducing Normalizing Flows (NFs), which enables the learnt densities to be\nmore complex and facilitate more accurate modeling for uncertainty. We prove\nthis hypothesis by adopting the Probabilistic U-Net and augmenting the\nposterior density with an NF, allowing it to be more expressive. Our\nqualitative as well as quantitative (GED and IoU) evaluations on the\nmulti-annotated and single-annotated LIDC-IDRI and Kvasir-SEG segmentation\ndatasets, respectively, show a clear improvement. This is mostly apparent in\nthe quantification of aleatoric uncertainty and the increased predictive\nperformance of up to 14 percent. This result strongly indicates that a more\nflexible density model should be seriously considered in architectures that\nattempt to capture segmentation ambiguity through density modeling.

    "abstract": "Modern processors have suffered a deluge of danger- ous side channel and\nspeculative execution attacks that exploit vulnerabilities rooted in branch\npredictor units (BPU). Many such attacks exploit the shared use of the BPU\nbetween un- related processes, which allows malicious processes to retrieve\nsensitive data or enable speculative execution attacks. Attacks that exploit\ncollisions between different branch instructions inside the BPU are among the\nmost dangerous. Various protections and mitigations are proposed such as CPU\nmicrocode updates, secured cache designs, fencing mechanisms, invisible\nspeculations. While some effectively mitigate speculative execution attacks,\nthey overlook BPU as an attack vector, leaving BPU prone to malicious\ncollisions and resulting critical penalty such as advanced micro-op cache\nattacks. Furthermore, some mitigations severely hamper the accuracy of the BPU\nresulting in increased CPU performance overhead. To address these, we present\nthe secret token branch predictor unit (STBPU), a branch predictor design that\nmitigates collision-based speculative execution attacks and BPU side channel\nwhilst incurring little to no performance overhead. STBPU achieves this by\ncustomizing inside data representations for each software entity requiring\nisolation. To prevent more advanced attacks, STBPU monitors hardware events and\npreemptively changes how STBPU data is stored and interpreted.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a new learning-based pipeline for the generation of\n3D shapes. We build our method on top of recent advances on the so called\nshape-from-spectrum paradigm, which aims at recovering the full 3D geometric\nstructure of an object only from the eigenvalues of its Laplacian operator. In\ndesigning our learning strategy, we consider the spectrum as a natural and\nready to use representation to encode variability of the shapes. Therefore, we\npropose a simple decoder-only architecture that directly maps spectra to 3D\nembeddings; in particular, we combine information from global and local\nspectra, the latter being obtained from localized variants of the manifold\nLaplacian. This combination captures the relations between the full shape and\nits local parts, leading to more accurate generation of geometric details and\nan improved semantic control in shape synthesis and novel editing applications.\nOur results confirm the improvement of the proposed approach in comparison to\nexisting and alternative methods.",

    "abstract": "Reversible computations constitute an unconventional form of computing where\nany sequence of performed operations can be undone by executing in reverse\norder at any point during a computation. It has been attracting increasing\nattention as it provides opportunities for low-power computation, being at the\nsame time essential or eligible in various applications. In recent work, we\nhave proposed a structural way of translating Reversing Petri Nets (RPNs) - a\ntype of Petri nets that embeds reversible computation, to bounded Coloured\nPetri Nets (CPNs) - an extension of traditional Petri Nets, where tokens carry\ndata values. Three reversing semantics are possible in RPNs: backtracking\n(reversing of the lately executed action), causal reversing (action can be\nreversed only when all its effects have been undone) and out of causal\nreversing (any previously performed action can be reversed). In this paper, we\nextend the RPN to CPN translation with formal proofs of correctness. Moreover,\nthe possibility of introduction of cycles to RPNs is discussed. We analyze\nwhich type of cycles could be allowed in RPNs to ensure consistency with the\ncurrent semantics. It emerged that the most interesting case related to cycles\nin RPNs occurs in causal semantics, where various interpretations of dependency\nresult in different net's behaviour during reversing.

Concretely, high-level features\nobtained from naive and prototypical contrastive learning are utilized to build\ndistribution graphs, guiding the process of low-level and mid-level feature\nlearning.

State-of-the-art recommendation models\nare one of the largest models rivalling the likes of GPT-3 and Switch\nTransformer. Challenges in deep learning recommendation models (DLRM) stem from\nlearning dense embeddings for each of the categorical values. These embedding\ntables in industrial scale models can be as large as hundreds of terabytes.\nSuch large models lead to a plethora of engineering challenges, not to mention\nprohibitive communication overheads, and slower training and inference times.\nOf these, slower inference time directly impacts user experience. Model\ncompression for DLRM is gaining traction and the community has recently shown\nimpressive compression results.

ROBE is a simple fundamental approach in\nimproving both cache performance and the variance of randomized hashing, which\ncould be of independent interest in itself.

    "title": "Numerical Algorithms for Water Waves with Background Flow over Obstacles  and Topography",
    "abstract": "We present two accurate and efficient algorithms for solving the\nincompressible, irrotational Euler equations with a free surface in two\ndimensions with background flow over a periodic, multiply-connected fluid\ndomain that includes stationary obstacles and variable bottom topography. One\napproach is formulated in terms of the surface velocity potential while the\nother evolves the vortex sheet strength. Both methods employ layer potentials\nin the form of periodized Cauchy integrals to compute the normal velocity of\nthe free surface. We prove that the resulting second-kind Fredholm integral\nequations are invertible. In the velocity potential formulation, invertibility\nis achieved after a physically motivated finite-rank correction. The integral\nequations for the two methods are closely related, one being the adjoint of the\nother after modifying it to evaluate the layer potentials on the opposite side\nof each interface. In addition to a background flow, both formulations allow\nfor circulation around each obstacle, which leads to multiple-valued velocity\npotentials but single-valued stream functions. The proposed boundary integral\nmethods are compatible with graph-based or angle-arclength parameterizations of\nthe free surface. In the latter case, we show how to avoid curve reconstruction\nerrors in interior Runge-Kutta stages due to incompatibility of the\nangle-arclength representation with spatial periodicity. The proposed methods\nare used to study gravity-capillary waves generated by flow over three\nelliptical obstacles with different choices of the circulation parameters. In\neach case, the free surface forms a structure resembling a Crapper wave that\nnarrows and eventually self intersects in a splash singularity.",

    "abstract": "Retinal vessel segmentation plays a key role in computer-aided screening,\ndiagnosis, and treatment of various cardiovascular and ophthalmic diseases.\nRecently, deep learning-based retinal vessel segmentation algorithms have\nachieved remarkable performance. However, due to the domain shift problem, the\nperformance of these algorithms often degrades when they are applied to new\ndata that is different from the training data. Manually labeling new data for\neach test domain is often a time-consuming and laborious task. In this work, we\nexplore unsupervised domain adaptation in retinal vessel segmentation by using\nentropy-based adversarial learning and transfer normalization layer to train a\nsegmentation network, which generalizes well across domains and requires no\nannotation of the target domain. Specifically, first, an entropy-based\nadversarial learning strategy is developed to reduce the distribution\ndiscrepancy between the source and target domains while also achieving the\nobjective of entropy minimization on the target domain. In addition, a new\ntransfer normalization layer is proposed to further boost the transferability\nof the deep network. It normalizes the features of each domain separately to\ncompensate for the domain distribution gap. Besides, it also adaptively selects\nthose feature channels that are more transferable between domains, thus further\nenhancing the generalization performance of the network. We conducted extensive\nexperiments on three regular fundus image datasets and an ultra-widefield\nfundus image dataset, and the results show that our approach yields significant\nperformance gains compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",

Because POD models usually provide\ngood approximation quality only locally, they have to be updated during\noptimization.

We take the view of a\nsimplified Newton method for solving semilinear evolution equations to derive\nan algorithm that can serve as an offline phase to produce a POD model.\nApproaches that build the POD model with impulse response snapshots can be\nregarded as the first Newton step in this context.\nIn particular, POD models that are based on impulse response snapshots are\nextended by adding a second simplified Newton step.

OncoNet demonstrates an\nAUROC of 0.86 and 0.84 on internal and external institution test sets\nrespectively for determination of change between scans while also showing\nstrong agreement to clinical scoring systems with a kappa score of 0.8. We also\ncurated a dataset of 1,954 paired FDG PET/CT exams designed for response\nassessment for the broader machine learning in healthcare research community.\nAutomated assessment of radiographic response from FDG PET/CT with OncoNet\ncould provide clinicians with a valuable tool to rapidly and consistently\ninterpret change over time in longitudinal multi-modal imaging exams.",

    "abstract": "Linear classifiers with random convolution kernels are computationally\nefficient methods that need no design or domain knowledge. Unlike deep neural\nnetworks, there is no need to hand-craft a network architecture; the kernels\nare randomly generated and only the linear classifier needs training. A\nrecently proposed method, RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transforms (ROCKETs), has\nshown high accuracy across a range of time-series data sets. Here we propose a\nmulti-scale version of this method, using both high- and low-frequency\ncomponents. We apply our methods to inter-burst detection in a cohort of\npreterm EEG recorded from 36 neonates <30 weeks gestational age. Two features\nfrom the convolution of 10,000 random kernels are combined using ridge\nregression. The proposed multi-scale ROCKET method out-performs the method\nwithout scale: median (interquartile range, IQR) Matthews correlation\ncoefficient (MCC) of 0.859 (0.815 to 0.874) for multi-scale versus 0.841 (0.807\nto 0.865) without scale, p<0.001. The proposed method lags behind an existing\nfeature-based machine learning method developed with deep domain knowledge, but\nis fast to train and can quickly set an initial baseline threshold of\nperformance for generic and biomedical time-series classification.",

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of IoT devices, the distributed control systems are\nnow capturing and processing more sensors at higher frequency than ever before.\nThese new data, due to their volume and novelty, cannot be effectively consumed\nwithout the help of data-driven techniques. Deep learning is emerging as a\npromising technique to analyze these data, particularly in soft sensor\nmodeling. The strong representational capabilities of complex data and the\nflexibility it offers from an architectural perspective make it a topic of\nactive applied research in industrial settings. However, the successful\napplications of deep learning in soft sensing are still not widely integrated\nin factory control systems, because most of the research on soft sensing do not\nhave access to large scale industrial data which are varied, noisy and\nincomplete. The results published in most research papers are therefore not\neasily reproduced when applied to the variety of data in industrial settings.\nHere we provide manufacturing data sets that are much larger and more complex\nthan public open soft sensor data. Moreover, the data sets are from Seagate\nfactories on active service with only necessary anonymization, so that they\nreflect the complex and noisy nature of real-world data. We introduce a\nvariance weighted multi-headed auto-encoder classification model that fits well\ninto the high-dimensional and highly imbalanced data. Besides the use of\nweighting or sampling methods to handle the highly imbalanced data, the model\nalso simultaneously predicts multiple outputs by exploiting output-supervised\nrepresentation learning and multi-task weighting.",

    "abstract": "Simulating quantum systems is one of the most important potential\napplications of quantum computers to demonstrate its advantages over classical\nalgorithms. The high-level circuit defining the simulation needs to be\ntransformed into one that compiles with hardware limitations such as qubit\nconnectivity and hardware gate set. Many techniques have been developed to\nefficiently compile quantum circuits while minimizing compilation overhead.\nHowever, general-purpose quantum compilers work at the gate level and have\nlittle knowledge of the mathematical properties of quantum applications,\nmissing further optimization opportunities. In this work, we exploit one\napplication-level property in Hamiltonian simulation, which is, the flexibility\nof permuting different operators in the Hamiltonian (no matter whether they\ncommute). We develop a compiler, named 2QAN, to optimize quantum circuits for\n2-local qubit Hamiltonian simulation problems, a framework which includes the\nimportant quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). In particular, we\npropose permutation-aware qubit mapping, qubit routing, gate optimization and\nscheduling techniques to minimize the compilation overhead. We evaluate 2QAN by\ncompiling three applications (up to 50 qubits) onto three quantum computers\nthat have different qubit topologies and hardware two-qubit gates, namely,\nGoogle Sycamore, IBMQ Montreal and Rigetti Aspen. Compared to state-of-the-art\nquantum compilers, 2QAN can reduce the number of inserted SWAP gates by up to\n11.5X, reduce overhead in hardware gate count by up to 30.7X, and reduce\noverhead in circuit depth by up to 21X. This significant overhead reduction\nwill help improve application performance. Experimental results on the Montreal\ndevice demonstrate that benchmarks compiled by 2QAN achieve highest fidelity.",

    "abstract": "A number of deep learning based algorithms have been proposed to recover\nhigh-quality videos from low-quality compressed ones. Among them, some restore\nthe missing details of each frame via exploring the spatiotemporal information\nof neighboring frames. However, these methods usually suffer from a narrow\ntemporal scope, thus may miss some useful details from some frames outside the\nneighboring ones. In this paper, to boost artifact removal, on the one hand, we\npropose a Recursive Fusion (RF) module to model the temporal dependency within\na long temporal range. Specifically, RF utilizes both the current reference\nframes and the preceding hidden state to conduct better spatiotemporal\ncompensation. On the other hand, we design an efficient and effective\nDeformable Spatiotemporal Attention (DSTA) module such that the model can pay\nmore effort on restoring the artifact-rich areas like the boundary area of a\nmoving object. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the\nexisting ones on the MFQE 2.0 dataset in terms of both fidelity and perceptual\neffect.

Acknowledging the distributional\nuncertainty in learning from limited samples, the min-max formulations\nintroduce an adversarial inner player to explore unseen covariate data. The\nresulting Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) formulations, which\ninclude Wasserstein DRO formulations (our main focus), are specified using\noptimal transportation phenomena. Upon describing how these\ninfinite-dimensional min-max problems can be approached via a\nfinite-dimensional dual reformulation, the tutorial moves into its main\ncomponent, namely, explaining a generic recipe for optimally selecting the size\nof the adversary's budget. This is achieved by studying the limit behavior of\nan optimal transport projection formulation arising from an inquiry on the\nsmallest confidence region that includes the unknown population risk minimizer.\nIncidentally, this systematic prescription coincides with those in specific\nexamples in high-dimensional statistics and results in error bounds that are\nfree from the curse of dimensions. Equipped with this prescription, we present\na central limit theorem for the DRO estimator and provide a recipe for\nconstructing compatible confidence regions that are useful for uncertainty\nquantification.

Under nearly lightless condition, existing image denoising methods could\neasily break down due to significantly low SNR. In this paper, we\nsystematically study the noise statistics in the imaging pipeline of CMOS\nphotosensors, and formulate a comprehensive noise model that can accurately\ncharacterize the real noise structures. Our novel model considers the noise\nsources caused by digital camera electronics which are largely overlooked by\nexisting methods yet have significant influence on raw measurement in the dark.\nIt provides a way to decouple the intricate noise structure into different\nstatistical distributions with physical interpretations. Moreover, our noise\nmodel can be used to synthesize realistic training data for learning-based\nlow-light denoising algorithms. In this regard, although promising results have\nbeen shown recently with deep convolutional neural networks, the success\nheavily depends on abundant noisy clean image pairs for training, which are\ntremendously difficult to obtain in practice. Generalizing their trained models\nto images from new devices is also problematic. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple low-light denoising datasets -- including a newly collected one in\nthis work covering various devices -- show that a deep neural network trained\nwith our proposed noise formation model can reach surprisingly-high accuracy.\nThe results are on par with or sometimes even outperform training with paired\nreal data, opening a new door to real-world extreme low-light photography.",
