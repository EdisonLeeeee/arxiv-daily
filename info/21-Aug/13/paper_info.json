    "title": "On the Relation of Trust and Explainability: Why to Engineer for  Trustworthiness",
    "abstract": "Recently, requirements for the explainability of software systems have gained\nprominence. One of the primary motivators for such requirements is that\nexplainability is expected to facilitate stakeholders' trust in a system.\nAlthough this seems intuitively appealing, recent psychological studies\nindicate that explanations do not necessarily facilitate trust. Thus,\nexplainability requirements might not be suitable for promoting trust.\nOne way to accommodate this finding is, we suggest, to focus on\ntrustworthiness instead of trust. While these two may come apart, we ideally\nwant both: a trustworthy system and the stakeholder's trust. In this paper, we\nargue that even though trustworthiness does not automatically lead to trust,\nthere are several reasons to engineer primarily for trustworthiness -- and that\na system's explainability can crucially contribute to its trustworthiness.",

    "abstract": "A promising approach to solving challenging long-horizon tasks has been to\nextract behavior priors (skills) by fitting generative models to large offline\ndatasets of demonstrations. However, such generative models inherit the biases\nof the underlying data and result in poor and unusable skills when trained on\nimperfect demonstration data. To better align skill extraction with human\nintent we present Skill Preferences (SkiP), an algorithm that learns a model\nover human preferences and uses it to extract human-aligned skills from offline\ndata. After extracting human-preferred skills, SkiP also utilizes human\nfeedback to solve down-stream tasks with RL. We show that SkiP enables a\nsimulated kitchen robot to solve complex multi-step manipulation tasks and\nsubstantially outperforms prior leading RL algorithms with human preferences as\nwell as leading skill extraction algorithms without human preferences.",

    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal forecasting is of great importance in a wide range of\ndynamical systems applications from atmospheric science, to recent COVID-19\nspread modeling. These applications rely on accurate predictions of\nspatio-temporal structured data reflecting real-world phenomena. A stunning\ncharacteristic is that the dynamical system is not only driven by some physics\nlaws but also impacted by the localized factor in spatial and temporal regions.\nOne of the major challenges is to infer the underlying causes, which generate\nthe perceived data stream and propagate the involved causal dynamics through\nthe distributed observing units. Another challenge is that the success of\nmachine learning based predictive models requires massive annotated data for\nmodel training. However, the acquisition of high-quality annotated data is\nobjectively manual and tedious as it needs a considerable amount of human\nintervention, making it infeasible in fields that require high levels of\nexpertise. To tackle these challenges, we advocate a spatio-temporal\nphysics-coupled neural networks (ST-PCNN) model to learn the underlying physics\nof the dynamical system and further couple the learned physics to assist the\nlearning of the recurring dynamics. To deal with data-acquisition constraints,\nan active learning mechanism with Kriging for actively acquiring the most\ninformative data is proposed for ST-PCNN training in a partially observable\nenvironment. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets exhibit\nthat the proposed ST-PCNN with active learning converges to near optimal\naccuracy with substantially fewer instances.",

    "abstract": "Using publicly available data to determine the performance of methodological\ncontributions is important as it facilitates reproducibility and allows\nscrutiny of the published results. In lung nodule classification, for example,\nmany works report results on the publicly available LIDC dataset. In theory,\nthis should allow a direct comparison of the performance of proposed methods\nand assess the impact of individual contributions. When analyzing seven recent\nworks, however, we find that each employs a different data selection process,\nleading to largely varying total number of samples and ratios between benign\nand malignant cases. As each subset will have different characteristics with\nvarying difficulty for classification, a direct comparison between the proposed\nmethods is thus not always possible, nor fair. We study the particular effect\nof truthing when aggregating labels from multiple experts. We show that\nspecific choices can have severe impact on the data distribution where it may\nbe possible to achieve superior performance on one sample distribution but not\non another. While we show that we can further improve on the state-of-the-art\non one sample selection, we also find that on a more challenging sample\nselection, on the same database, the more advanced models underperform with\nrespect to very simple baseline methods, highlighting that the selected data\ndistribution may play an even more important role than the model architecture.\nThis raises concerns about the validity of claimed methodological\ncontributions.

    "abstract": "Brain aging, and more specifically the difference between the chronological\nand the biological age of a person, may be a promising biomarker for\nidentifying neurodegenerative diseases. For this purpose accurate prediction is\nimportant but the localisation of the areas that play a significant role in the\nprediction is also crucial, in order to gain clinicians' trust and reassurance\nabout the performance of a prediction model. Most interpretability methods are\nfocused on classification tasks and cannot be directly transferred to\nregression tasks. In this study, we focus on the task of brain age regression\nfrom 3D brain Magnetic Resonance (MR) images using a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork, termed prediction model. We interpret its predictions by extracting\nimportance maps, which discover the parts of the brain that are the most\nimportant for brain age. In order to do so, we assume that voxels that are not\nuseful for the regression are resilient to noise addition. We implement a noise\nmodel which aims to add as much noise as possible to the input without harming\nthe performance of the prediction model. We average the importance maps of the\nsubjects and end up with a population-based importance map, which displays the\nregions of the brain that are influential for the task. We test our method on\n13,750 3D brain MR images from the UK Biobank, and our findings are consistent\nwith the existing neuropathology literature, highlighting that the hippocampus\nand the ventricles are the most relevant regions for brain aging.",

    "abstract": "For the problem of task-agnostic reinforcement learning (RL), an agent first\ncollects samples from an unknown environment without the supervision of reward\nsignals, then is revealed with a reward and is asked to compute a corresponding\nnear-optimal policy. Existing approaches mainly concern the worst-case\nscenarios, in which no structural information of the reward/transition-dynamics\nis utilized. Therefore the best sample upper bound is\n$\\propto\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\epsilon^2)$, where $\\epsilon>0$ is the\ntarget accuracy of the obtained policy, and can be overly pessimistic. To\ntackle this issue, we provide an efficient algorithm that utilizes a gap\nparameter, $\\rho>0$, to reduce the amount of exploration. In particular, for an\nunknown finite-horizon Markov decision process, the algorithm takes only\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}} (1/\\epsilon \\cdot (H^3SA / \\rho + H^4 S^2 A) )$\nepisodes of exploration, and is able to obtain an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy for\na post-revealed reward with sub-optimality gap at least $\\rho$, where $S$ is\nthe number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $H$ is the length of\nthe horizon, obtaining a nearly \\emph{quadratic saving} in terms of $\\epsilon$.\nWe show that, information-theoretically, this bound is nearly tight for $\\rho <\n\\Theta(1/(HS))$ and $H>1$. We further show that\n$\\propto\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1)$ sample bound is possible for $H=1$ (i.e.,\nmulti-armed bandit) or with a sampling simulator, establishing a stark\nseparation between those settings and the RL setting.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning algorithms mine knowledge from the training data and thus would\nlikely inherit the dataset's bias information. As a result, the obtained model\nwould generalize poorly and even mislead the decision process in real-life\napplications. We propose to remove the bias information misused by the target\ntask with a cross-sample adversarial debiasing (CSAD) method. CSAD explicitly\nextracts target and bias features disentangled from the latent representation\ngenerated by a feature extractor and then learns to discover and remove the\ncorrelation between the target and bias features. The correlation measurement\nplays a critical role in adversarial debiasing and is conducted by a\ncross-sample neural mutual information estimator. Moreover, we propose joint\ncontent and local structural representation learning to boost mutual\ninformation estimation for better performance. We conduct thorough experiments\non publicly available datasets to validate the advantages of the proposed\nmethod over state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "In this project, we designed a DC motor whose speed can be controlled by a\nPID controller. The proportional, integral and derivative gains (KP, KI, KD) of\nthe PID controller are adjusted according to Fuzzy logic. First of all, the\nfuzzy logic controller is designed according to rules so that the systems is\nbasically robust. There are 25 rules for the auto-tuning of each parameter of\nthe PID controller. The FLC (fuzzy logic controller) has two inputs. The first\nis the motor speed error between the reference (setpoint) and the actual speed.\nThe second is the variation of the speed error (derivative of the speed error).\nSecondly the output of the FLC is the parameters of the PID controller which\nare used to control the speed of the DC motor. The study shows that both the\nprecise characters of PID controllers and the flexible characters of fuzzy\ncontrollers are present in the fuzzy self-tuning PID controller. The fuzzy\nauto-tuning approach implemented on a conventional PID structure was able to\ncontrol the speed of the DC motor. It also improved the dynamic and static\nresponse of the system. The comparison between the conventional response and\nthe fuzzy self-tuning response was performed based on the simulation result\nobtained by MATLAB/SIMULINK.\nThe simulation results show that the designed self-adaptive PID controller\nachieves good dynamic behavior of the DC motor, perfect speed tracking with\nshort rise and settling times, zero overshoot and steady state error and thus\ngives better performance compared to the conventional PID controller. We then\nmodel the fuzzy PID using simple code on Arduino IDE and perform a practical\nexperiment, to confirm our theorical results.",

    "abstract": "Recently, needs for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that are attachable to\nthe wall have been highlighted. As one of the ways to address the need,\nresearches on various tilting multirotors that can increase maneuverability has\nbeen employed. Unfortunately, existing studies on the tilting multirotors\nrequire considerable amounts of prior information on the complex dynamic model.\nMeanwhile, reinforcement learning on quadrotors has been studied to mitigate\nthis issue. Yet, these are only been applied to standard quadrotors, whose\nsystems are less complex than those of tilting multirotors. In this paper, a\nnovel reinforcement learning-based method is proposed to control a tilting\nmultirotor on real-world applications, which is the first attempt to apply\nreinforcement learning to a tilting multirotor. To do so, we propose a novel\nreward function for a neural network model that takes power efficiency into\naccount. The model is initially trained over a simulated environment and then\nfine-tuned using real-world data in order to overcome the sim-to-real gap\nissue. Furthermore, a novel, efficient state representation with respect to the\ngoal frame that helps the network learn optimal policy better is proposed. As\nverified on real-world experiments, our proposed method shows robust\ncontrollability by overcoming the complex dynamics of tilting multirotors.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art search-based approaches for test case generation work at\ntest case level, where tests are represented as sequences of statements. These\napproaches make use of genetic operators (i.e., mutation and crossover) that\ncreate test variants by adding, altering, and removing statements from existing\ntests. While this encoding schema has been shown to be very effective for\nmany-objective test case generation, the standard crossover operator\n(single-point) only alters the structure of the test cases but not the input\ndata. In this paper, we argue that changing both the test case structure and\nthe input data is necessary to increase the genetic variation and improve the\nsearch process. Hence, we propose a hybrid multi-level crossover (HMX) operator\nthat combines the traditional test-level crossover with data-level\nrecombination. The former evolves and alters the test case structures, while\nthe latter evolves the input data using numeric and string-based\nrecombinational operators. We evaluate our new crossover operator by performing\nan empirical study on more than 100 classes selected from open-source Java\nlibraries for numerical operations and string manipulation. We compare HMX with\nthe single-point crossover that is used in EvoSuite w.r.t structural coverage\nand fault detection capability. Our results show that HMX achieves a\nstatistically significant increase in 30% of the classes up to 19% in\nstructural coverage compared to the single-point crossover. Moreover, the fault\ndetection capability improved up to 12% measured using strong mutation score.",

We construct two special NE realized by a lexicographically safe\n(lexsafe) strategy of one player and a best response of the other. We obtain a\npolynomial algorithm computing these lexsafe NE.

In this paper, we focus on ranking\nalgorithms for recruitment process, that employ text embeddings for ranking\napplicants resumes when compared to a job description. We demonstrate both\nwhite box and black box attacks that identify text items, that based on their\nlocation in embedding space, have significant contribution in increasing the\nsimilarity score between a resume and a job description. The adversary then\nuses these text items to improve the ranking of their resume among others. We\ntested recruitment algorithms that use the similarity scores obtained from\nUniversal Sentence Encoder (USE) and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency\n(TF IDF) vectors. Our results show that in both adversarial settings, on\naverage the attacker is successful. We also found that attacks against TF IDF\nis more successful compared to USE.",

Based on this feature, RIS can be\nemployed to facilitate Physical-layer Key Generation (PKG). However, this\ntechnique could also be exploited by the attacker to destroy the key generation\nprocess via manipulating the channel features at the legitimate user side.\nSpecifically, this paper proposes a new RIS-assisted Manipulating attack (RISM)\nthat reduces the wireless channel reciprocity by rapidly changing the RIS\nreflection coefficient in the uplink and downlink channel probing step in\northogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The vulnerability of\ntraditional key generation technology based on channel frequency response (CFR)\nunder this attack is analyzed. Then, we propose a slewing rate detection method\nbased on path separation. The attacked path is removed from the time domain and\na flexible quantization method is employed to maximize the Key Generation Rate\n(KGR). The simulation results show that under RISM attack, when the ratio of\nthe attack path variance to the total path variance is 0.17, the Bit\nDisagreement Rate (BDR) of the CFR-based method is greater than 0.25, and the\nKGR is close to zero. In addition, the proposed detection method can\nsuccessfully detect the attacked path for SNR above 0 dB in the case of 16\nrounds of probing and the KGR is 35 bits/channel use at 23.04MHz bandwidth.",

To this end, we propose a novel deep clustering method\nnamed Attention-driven Graph Clustering Network (AGCN). Specifically, AGCN\nexploits a heterogeneity-wise fusion module to dynamically fuse the node\nattribute feature and the topological graph feature. Moreover, AGCN develops a\nscale-wise fusion module to adaptively aggregate the multi-scale features\nembedded at different layers. Based on a unified optimization framework, AGCN\ncan jointly perform feature learning and cluster assignment in an unsupervised\nfashion. Compared with the existing deep clustering methods, our method is more\nflexible and effective since it comprehensively considers the numerous and\ndiscriminative information embedded in the network and directly produces the\nclustering results.

Our evaluations simulate the application of peer prediction\nmechanisms to peer assessment---a setting in which realistic models have been\nvalidated on real data and in which ex post fairness concerns are quite\nsalient. We find that peer prediction mechanisms, as proposed in the\nliterature, largely fail to demonstrate measurement integrity in our\nexperiments.

In this dimension of analysis, we again find that supplementing\ncertain mechanisms with parametric statistical models can improve their\nempirical performance. Even so, though, we find that theoretical guarantees of\nrobustness against strategic behavior are somewhat noisy predictors of\nempirical robustness.\nAs a whole, our empirical methodology for quantifying desirable mechanism\nproperties facilitates a more nuanced comparison between mechanisms than\ntheoretical analysis alone.

    "abstract": "Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) bring promise of increasing traffic\ncapacity and energy efficiency by forming platoons with short headways on the\nroad. However at low CAV penetration, the capacity gain will be small because\nthe CAVs that randomly enter the road will be sparsely distributed, diminishing\nthe probability of forming long platoons. Many researchers propose to solve\nthis issue by platoon organization strategies, where the CAVs search for other\nCAVs on the road and change lanes if necessary to form longer platoons.\nHowever, the current literature does not analyze a potential risk of platoon\norganization in disrupting the flow and reducing the capacity by inducing more\nlane changes. In this research, we use driving model of Cooperative Adaptive\nCruise Control (CACC) vehicles and human-driven vehicles that are validated\nwith field experiments and find that platoon organization can indeed drop the\ncapacity with more lane changes. But when the traffic demand is well below\ncapacity, platoon organization forms longer CAV platoons without reducing the\nflow. Based on this finding, we develop the Flow-Aware platoon organization\nstrategy, where the CAVs perform platoon organization conditionally on the\nlocal traffic state, i.e., a low flow and a high speed. We simulate the\nFlow-Aware platoon organization on a realistic freeway network and show that\nthe CAVs successfully form longer platoons, while ensuring a maximal traffic\nflow.",

The present work shows that it is\npossible to extract lung X-ray characteristics to improve the methods of\nexamining and diagnosing patients with suspected COVID-19, distinguishing them\nfrom malaria, dengue, H1N1, tuberculosis, and Streptococcus pneumonia. More\nprecisely, an intelligent computational model was developed to process lung\nX-ray images and classify whether the image is of a patient with COVID-19. The\nimages were processed and extracted their characteristics. These\ncharacteristics were the input data for an unsupervised statistical learning\nmethod, PCA, and clustering, which identified specific attributes of X-ray\nimages with Covid-19. The introduction of statistical models allowed a fast\nalgorithm, which used the X-means clustering method associated with the\nBayesian Information Criterion (CIB). The developed algorithm efficiently\ndistinguished each pulmonary pathology from X-ray images. The method exhibited\nexcellent sensitivity.

    "abstract": "Mode-switching supports multilevel operations using a limited number of input\nmethods. In Virtual Reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMD), common approaches\nfor mode-switching use buttons, controllers, and users' hands. However, they\nare inefficient and challenging to do with tasks that require both hands (e.g.,\nwhen users need to use two hands during drawing operations). Using head\ngestures for mode-switching can be an efficient and cost-effective way,\nallowing for a more continuous and smooth transition between modes. In this\npaper, we explore the use of head gestures for mode-switching especially in\nscenarios when both users' hands are performing tasks. We present a first user\nstudy that evaluated eight head gestures that could be suitable for VR HMD with\na dual-hand line-drawing task. Results show that move forward, move backward,\nroll left, and roll right led to better performance and are preferred by\nparticipants. A second study integrating these four gestures in Tilt Brush, an\nopen-source painting VR application, is conducted to further explore the\napplicability of these gestures and derive insights. Results show that Tilt\nBrush with head gestures allowed users to change modes with ease and led to\nimproved interaction and user experience.

To achieve this goal, we present a novel\nmethod for robots to imagine the sitting pose of the bear by physically\nsimulating a virtual humanoid agent sitting on the chair. We also develop a\nrobotic system which leverages motion planning to plan SE(2) motions for a\nhumanoid robot to walk to the chair and whole-body motions to put the bear on\nit, respectively. Furthermore, to cope with the cases where the chair is not in\nan accessible pose for placing the bear, a human-robot interaction (HRI)\nframework is introduced in which a human follows language instructions given by\nthe robot to rotate the chair and help make the chair accessible. We implement\nour method with a robot arm and a humanoid robot. We calibrate the proposed\nsystem with 3 chairs and test on 12 previously unseen chairs in both accessible\nand inaccessible poses extensively. Results show that our method enables the\nrobot to autonomously put the teddy bear on the 12 unseen chairs with a very\nhigh success rate. The HRI framework is also shown to be very effective in\nchanging the accessibility of the chair. Source code will be available.

In previous studies, the decision-making of lane-changing\nof the human drivers was mainly used to increase the individual's benefit.\nHowever, the lane-changing behavior of these human drivers can sometimes have a\nbad influence on the overall traffic flow. As technology for autonomous\nvehicles develop, lane changing action as well as lane changing decision making\nfall within the control category of autonomous vehicles. However, since many of\nthe current lane-changing decision algorithms of autonomous vehicles are based\non the human driver model, it is hard to know the potential traffic impact of\nsuch lane change. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the decision-making\nof lane change considering traffic flow, and accordingly, we study the lane\nchange control system considering the whole traffic flow. In this research, the\nlane change control system predicts the future traffic situation through the\ncell transition model, one of the most popular macroscopic traffic simulation\nmodels, and determines the change probability of each lane that minimizes the\ntotal time delay through the genetic algorithm. The lane change control system\nthen conveys the change probability to this vehicle. In the macroscopic\nsimulation result, the proposed control system reduced the overall travel time\ndelay. The proposed system is applied to microscopic traffic simulation, the\noversaturated freeway traffic flow algorithm (OFFA), to evaluate the potential\nperformance when it is applied to the actual traffic system. In the traffic\nflow-density, the maximum traffic flow has been shown to be increased, and the\npoints in the congestion area have also been greatly reduced.

To tackle such a severely ill-posed problem, we propose\na physically-interpretable, compact, efficient, and end-to-end learning-based\nframework, namely AGD-Net. Precisely, by taking advantage of the imaging\nprocess, we first formulate the problem explicitly based on the classic\ngradient descent algorithm. Then, we design a lightweight neural network with a\nmulti-stage architecture to mimic the formed amended gradient descent process,\nin which efficient convolution and novel spectral zero-mean normalization are\nproposed to effectively extract spatial-spectral features for regressing an\ninitialization, a basic gradient, and an incremental gradient. Besides, based\non the approximate low-rank property of HS images, we propose a novel rank loss\nto promote the similarity between the global structures of reconstructed and\nground-truth HS images, which is optimized with our singular value weighting\nstrategy during training. Moreover, AGD-Net, a single network after one-time\ntraining, is flexible to handle the reconstruction with various spectral\nresponse functions. Extensive experiments over three commonly-used benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that AGD-Net can improve the reconstruction quality by\nmore than 1.0 dB on average while saving 67$\\times$ parameters and 32$\\times$\nFLOPs, compared with state-of-the-art methods.

The key of\nrecommender systems is to predict how likely users will interact with items\nbased on their historical online behaviors, e.g., clicks, add-to-cart,\npurchases, etc. To exploit these user-item interactions, there are increasing\nefforts on considering the user-item interactions as a user-item bipartite\ngraph and then performing information propagation in the graph via Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs). Given the power of GNNs in graph representation learning,\nthese GNN-based recommendation methods have remarkably boosted the\nrecommendation performance. Despite their success, most existing GNN-based\nrecommender systems overlook the existence of interactions caused by unreliable\nbehaviors (e.g., random/bait clicks) and uniformly treat all the interactions,\nwhich can lead to sub-optimal and unstable performance.

In\nthis paper, a point cloud is encoded into a Concentric Zone Model-based\nrepresentation to assign an appropriate density of cloud points among bins in a\nway that is not computationally complex. This is followed by Region-wise Ground\nPlane Fitting, which is performed to estimate the partial ground for each bin.\nFinally, Ground Likelihood Estimation is introduced to dramatically reduce\nfalse positives.

Despite these efforts, UDA still has a long way to go to\nreach the fully supervised performance. To this end, we propose a Labeling Only\nif Required strategy, LabOR, where we introduce a human-in-the-loop approach to\nadaptively give scarce labels to points that a UDA model is uncertain about. In\norder to find the uncertain points, we generate an inconsistency mask using the\nproposed adaptive pixel selector and we label these segment-based regions to\nachieve near supervised performance with only a small fraction (about 2.2%)\nground truth points, which we call \"Segment based Pixel-Labeling (SPL)\". To\nfurther reduce the efforts of the human annotator, we also propose \"Point-based\nPixel-Labeling (PPL)\", which finds the most representative points for labeling\nwithin the generated inconsistency mask. This reduces efforts from 2.2% segment\nlabel to 40 points label while minimizing performance degradation.

Recent neural advances still\nlack the controllable and interactive bullet-time design ability for human\nfree-viewpoint rendering, especially under the real-time, dynamic and general\nsetting for our trajectory-aware task. To fill this gap, in this paper we\npropose a neural interactive bullet-time generator (iButter) for\nphoto-realistic human free-viewpoint rendering from dense RGB streams, which\nenables flexible and interactive design for human bullet-time visual effects.\nOur iButter approach consists of a real-time preview and design stage as well\nas a trajectory-aware refinement stage.

However, face-to-face\nmeetings are not suited to every situation and every stakeholder, for example\ndue to scheduling constraints.

    "abstract": "In clinical practice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with multiple\ncontrasts is usually acquired in a single study to assess different properties\nof the same region of interest in human body. The whole acquisition process can\nbe accelerated by having one or more modalities under-sampled in the k-space.\nRecent researches demonstrate that, considering the redundancy between\ndifferent contrasts or modalities, a target MRI modality under-sampled in the\nk-space can be better reconstructed with the helps from a fully-sampled\nsequence (i.e., the reference modality). It implies that, in the same study of\nthe same subject, multiple sequences can be utilized together toward the\npurpose of highly efficient multi-modal reconstruction. However, we find that\nmulti-modal reconstruction can be negatively affected by subtle spatial\nmisalignment between different sequences, which is actually common in clinical\npractice. In this paper, we integrate the spatial alignment network with\nreconstruction, to improve the quality of the reconstructed target modality.\nSpecifically, the spatial alignment network estimates the spatial misalignment\nbetween the fully-sampled reference and the under-sampled target images, and\nwarps the reference image accordingly. Then, the aligned fully-sampled\nreference image joins the under-sampled target image in the reconstruction\nnetwork, to produce the high-quality target image. Considering the contrast\ndifference between the target and the reference, we particularly design the\ncross-modality-synthesis-based registration loss, in combination with the\nreconstruction loss, to jointly train the spatial alignment network and the\nreconstruction network. Our experiments on both clinical MRI and multi-coil\nk-space raw data demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our spatial\nalignment network.

However, we argue that existing methods have overlooked\ntwo important drawbacks: 1) inadequate use of motion information and 2) the\nincompatibility of prevailing cross-entropy training loss. In this paper, we\nanalyze that the motion cues behind the optical flow features are complementary\ninformative. Inspired by this, we propose to build a context-dependent motion\nprior, termed as motionness. Specifically, a motion graph is introduced to\nmodel motionness based on the local motion carrier (e.g., optical flow). In\naddition, to highlight more informative video snippets, a motion-guided loss is\nproposed to modulate the network training conditioned on motionness scores.\nExtensive ablation studies confirm that motionness efficaciously models\naction-of-interest, and the motion-guided loss leads to more accurate results.\nBesides, our motion-guided loss is a plug-and-play loss function and is\napplicable with existing WSTAL methods. Without loss of generality, based on\nthe standard MIL pipeline, our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance\non three challenging benchmarks, including THUMOS'14, ActivityNet v1.2 and\nv1.3.",

While the mainstream technique seeks to completely filter\nout the OOD samples for semi-supervised learning (SSL), we propose a novel\ntraining mechanism that could effectively exploit the presence of OOD data for\nenhanced feature learning while avoiding its adverse impact on the SSL. We\nachieve this goal by first introducing a warm-up training that leverages all\nthe unlabeled data, including both the in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples.\nSpecifically, we perform a pretext task that enforces our feature extractor to\nobtain a high-level semantic understanding of the training images, leading to\nmore discriminative features that can benefit the downstream tasks. Since the\nOOD samples are inevitably detrimental to SSL, we propose a novel cross-modal\nmatching strategy to detect OOD samples. Instead of directly applying binary\nclassification, we train the network to predict whether the data sample is\nmatched to an assigned one-hot class label. The appeal of the proposed\ncross-modal matching over binary classification is the ability to generate a\ncompatible feature space that aligns with the core classification task.\nExtensive experiments show that our approach substantially lifts the\nperformance on open-set SSL and outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large\nmargin.",

    "abstract": "The top search results matching a user query that are displayed on the first\npage are critical to the effectiveness and perception of a search system. A\nsearch ranking system typically orders the results by independent\nquery-document scores to produce a slate of search results. However, such\nunilateral scoring methods may fail to capture inter-document dependencies that\nusers are sensitive to, thus producing a sub-optimal slate. Further, in\npractice, many real-world applications such as e-commerce search require\nenforcing certain distributional criteria at the slate-level, due to business\nobjectives or long term user retention goals. Unilateral scoring of results\ndoes not explicitly support optimizing for such objectives with respect to a\nslate. Hence, solutions to the slate optimization problem must consider the\noptimal selection and order of the documents, along with adherence to\nslate-level distributional criteria. To that end, we propose a hybrid framework\nextended from traditional slate optimization to solve the conditional slate\noptimization problem. We introduce conditional sequential slate optimization\n(CSSO), which jointly learns to optimize for traditional ranking metrics as\nwell as prescribed distribution criteria of documents within the slate. The\nproposed method can be applied to practical real world problems such as\nenforcing diversity in e-commerce search results, mitigating bias in top\nresults and personalization of results.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) solutions are prevalent. However, many challenges exist\nin making these solutions business-grade. One major challenge is to ensure that\nthe ML solution provides its expected business value. In order to do that, one\nhas to bridge the gap between the way ML model performance is measured and the\nsolution requirements. In previous work (Barash et al, \"Bridging the gap...\")\nwe demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing feature models in bridging this\ngap. Whereas ML performance metrics, such as the accuracy or F1-score of a\nclassifier, typically measure the average ML performance, feature models shed\nlight on explainable data slices that are too far from that average, and\ntherefore might indicate unsatisfied requirements. For example, the overall\naccuracy of a bank text terms classifier may be very high, say $98\\% \\pm 2\\%$,\nyet it might perform poorly for terms that include short descriptions and\noriginate from commercial accounts. A business requirement, which may be\nimplicit in the training data, may be to perform well regardless of the type of\naccount and length of the description. Therefore, the under-performing data\nslice that includes short descriptions and commercial accounts suggests\npoorly-met requirements. In this paper we show the feasibility of automatically\nextracting feature models that result in explainable data slices over which the\nML solution under-performs.

    "abstract": "To accommodate rapid changes in the real world, the cognition system of\nhumans is capable of continually learning concepts. On the contrary,\nconventional deep learning models lack this capability of preserving previously\nlearned knowledge. When a neural network is fine-tuned to learn new tasks, its\nperformance on previously trained tasks will significantly deteriorate. Many\nrecent works on incremental object detection tackle this problem by introducing\nadvanced regularization. Although these methods have shown promising results,\nthe benefits are often short-lived after the first incremental step. Under\nmulti-step incremental learning, the trade-off between old knowledge preserving\nand new task learning becomes progressively more severe. Thus, the performance\nof regularization-based incremental object detectors gradually decays for\nsubsequent learning steps. In this paper, we aim to alleviate this performance\ndecay on multi-step incremental detection tasks by proposing a dilatable\nincremental object detector (DIODE). For the task-shared parameters, our method\nadaptively penalizes the changes of important weights for previous tasks. At\nthe same time, the structure of the model is dilated or expanded by a limited\nnumber of task-specific parameters to promote new task learning. Extensive\nexperiments on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets demonstrate substantial\nimprovements over the state-of-the-art methods. Notably, compared with the\nstate-of-the-art methods, our method achieves up to 6.0% performance\nimprovement by increasing the number of parameters by just 1.2% for each newly\nlearned task.",

    "abstract": "With the availability of many datasets tailored for autonomous driving in\nreal-world urban scenes, semantic segmentation for urban driving scenes\nachieves significant progress. However, semantic segmentation for off-road,\nunstructured environments is not widely studied. Directly applying existing\nsegmentation networks often results in performance degradation as they cannot\novercome intrinsic problems in such environments, such as illumination changes.\nIn this paper, a built-in memory module for semantic segmentation is proposed\nto overcome these problems. The memory module stores significant\nrepresentations of training images as memory items. In addition to the encoder\nembedding like items together, the proposed memory module is specifically\ndesigned to cluster together instances of the same class even when there are\nsignificant variances in embedded features. Therefore, it makes segmentation\nnetworks better deal with unexpected illumination changes. A triplet loss is\nused in training to minimize redundancy in storing discriminative\nrepresentations of the memory module. The proposed memory module is general so\nthat it can be adopted in a variety of networks. We conduct experiments on the\nRobot Unstructured Ground Driving (RUGD) dataset and RELLIS dataset, which are\ncollected from off-road, unstructured natural environments. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed memory module improves the performance of\nexisting segmentation networks and contributes to capturing unclear objects\nover various off-road, unstructured natural scenes with equivalent\ncomputational cost and network parameters.

    "abstract": "Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) is a widely researched tool for\nneural architecture search, due to its promising results for image\nclassification. The main benefit of DARTS is the effectiveness achieved through\nthe weight-sharing one-shot paradigm, which allows efficient architecture\nsearch. In this work, we investigate DARTS in a systematic case study of\ninverse problems, which allows us to analyze these potential benefits in a\ncontrolled manner. Although we demonstrate that the success of DARTS can be\nextended from image classification to reconstruction, our experiments yield\nthree fundamental difficulties in the evaluation of DARTS-based methods: First,\nthe results show a large variance in all test cases. Second, the final\nperformance is highly dependent on the hyperparameters of the optimizer. And\nthird, the performance of the weight-sharing architecture used during training\ndoes not reflect the final performance of the found architecture well. Thus, we\nconclude the necessity to 1) report the results of any DARTS-based methods from\nseveral runs along with its underlying performance statistics, 2) show the\ncorrelation of the training and final architecture performance, and 3)\ncarefully consider if the computational efficiency of DARTS outweighs the costs\nof hyperparameter optimization and multiple runs.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning is gaining instant popularity in computer aided diagnosis of\nCOVID-19. Due to the high sensitivity of Computed Tomography (CT) to this\ndisease, CT-based COVID-19 detection with visual models is currently at the\nforefront of medical imaging research. Outcomes published in this direction are\nfrequently claiming highly accurate detection under deep transfer learning.\nThis is leading medical technologists to believe that deep transfer learning is\nthe mainstream solution for the problem. However, our critical analysis of the\nliterature reveals an alarming performance disparity between different\npublished results. Hence, we conduct a systematic thorough investigation to\nanalyze the effectiveness of deep transfer learning for COVID-19 detection with\nCT images. Exploring 14 state-of-the-art visual models with over 200 model\ntraining sessions, we conclusively establish that the published literature is\nfrequently overestimating transfer learning performance for the problem, even\nin the prestigious scientific sources. The roots of overestimation trace back\nto inappropriate data curation. We also provide case studies that consider more\nrealistic scenarios, and establish transparent baselines for the problem.

    "abstract": "Recent research has witnessed advances in facial image editing tasks\nincluding face swapping and face reenactment. However, these methods are\nconfined to dealing with one specific task at a time. In addition, for video\nfacial editing, previous methods either simply apply transformations frame by\nframe or utilize multiple frames in a concatenated or iterative fashion, which\nleads to noticeable visual flickers. In this paper, we propose a unified\ntemporally consistent facial video editing framework termed UniFaceGAN. Based\non a 3D reconstruction model and a simple yet efficient dynamic training sample\nselection mechanism, our framework is designed to handle face swapping and face\nreenactment simultaneously. To enforce the temporal consistency, a novel 3D\ntemporal loss constraint is introduced based on the barycentric coordinate\ninterpolation. Besides, we propose a region-aware conditional normalization\nlayer to replace the traditional AdaIN or SPADE to synthesize more\ncontext-harmonious results. Compared with the state-of-the-art facial image\nediting methods, our framework generates video portraits that are more\nphoto-realistic and temporally smooth.",

    "abstract": "Recently, pre-trained language models such as BERT have been applied to\ndocument ranking for information retrieval, which first pre-train a general\nlanguage model on an unlabeled large corpus and then conduct ranking-specific\nfine-tuning on expert-labeled relevance datasets. Ideally, an IR system would\nmodel relevance from a user-system dualism: the user's view and the system's\nview. User's view judges the relevance based on the activities of \"real users\"\nwhile the system's view focuses on the relevance signals from the system side,\ne.g., from the experts or algorithms, etc. Inspired by the user-system\nrelevance views and the success of pre-trained language models, in this paper\nwe propose a novel ranking framework called Pre-Rank that takes both user's\nview and system's view into consideration, under the pre-training and\nfine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, to model the user's view of relevance,\nPre-Rank pre-trains the initial query-document representations based on\nlarge-scale user activities data such as the click log. To model the system's\nview of relevance, Pre-Rank further fine-tunes the model on expert-labeled\nrelevance data. More importantly, the pre-trained representations, are\nfine-tuned together with handcrafted learning-to-rank features under a wide and\ndeep network architecture. In this way, Pre-Rank can model the relevance by\nincorporating the relevant knowledge and signals from both real search users\nand the IR experts. To verify the effectiveness of Pre-Rank, we showed two\nimplementations by using BERT and SetRank as the underlying ranking model,\nrespectively. Experimental results base on three publicly available benchmarks\nshowed that in both of the implementations, Pre-Rank can respectively\noutperform the underlying ranking models and achieved state-of-the-art\nperformances.",

FL ensures no data leaves its source as the\nmodel is trained at where the data resides. However, FL comes with its own set\nof challenges.

In this context, we\npropose a mechanism of compressing the weight updates using Autoencoders (AE),\nwhich learn the data features of the weight updates and subsequently perform\ncompression. The encoder is set up on each of the nodes where the training is\nperformed while the decoder is set up on the node where the weights are\naggregated.

This\npaper shows that the dynamic and orthogonal AE based weight compression\ntechnique could serve as an advantageous alternative (or an add-on) in a large\nscale FL, as it not only achieves compression ratios ranging from 500x to 1720x\nand beyond, but can also be modified based on the accuracy requirements,\ncomputational capacity, and other requirements of the given FL setup.",

    "title": "How Nonconformity Functions and Difficulty of Datasets Impact the  Efficiency of Conformal Classifiers",
    "abstract": "The property of conformal predictors to guarantee the required accuracy rate\nmakes this framework attractive in various practical applications. However,\nthis property is achieved at a price of reduction in precision. In the case of\nconformal classification, the systems can output multiple class labels instead\nof one. It is also known from the literature, that the choice of nonconformity\nfunction has a major impact on the efficiency of conformal classifiers.\nRecently, it was shown that different model-agnostic nonconformity functions\nresult in conformal classifiers with different characteristics. For a Neural\nNetwork-based conformal classifier, the inverse probability (or hinge loss)\nallows minimizing the average number of predicted labels, and margin results in\na larger fraction of singleton predictions. In this work, we aim to further\nextend this study. We perform an experimental evaluation using 8 different\nclassification algorithms and discuss when the previously observed relationship\nholds or not. Additionally, we propose a successful method to combine the\nproperties of these two nonconformity functions. The experimental evaluation is\ndone using 11 real and 5 synthetic datasets.",

    "abstract": "Spurred by a huge interest in the post-Shannon communication, it has recently\nbeen shown that leveraging semantics can significantly improve the\ncommunication effectiveness across many tasks. In this article, inspired by\nhuman communication, we propose a novel stochastic model of System 1\nsemantics-native communication (SNC) for generic tasks, where a speaker has an\nintention of referring to an entity, extracts the semantics, and communicates\nits symbolic representation to a target listener. To further reach its full\npotential, we additionally infuse contextual reasoning into SNC such that the\nspeaker locally and iteratively self-communicates with a virtual agent built on\nthe physical listener's unique way of coding its semantics, i.e., communication\ncontext. The resultant System 2 SNC allows the speaker to extract the most\neffective semantics for its listener. Leveraging the proposed stochastic model,\nwe show that the reliability of System 2 SNC increases with the number of\nmeaningful concepts, and derive the expected semantic representation (SR) bit\nlength which quantifies the extracted effective semantics. It is also shown\nthat System 2 SNC significantly reduces the SR length without compromising\ncommunication reliability.",

With average accuracy above 0.9 over the scores of all languages,\nthe task is considered mostly solved using relatively generic neural\nsequence-to-sequence models, even with little data provided. In this work, we\npropose to re-evaluate morphological inflection models by employing harder\ntrain-test splits that will challenge the generalization capacity of the\nmodels. In particular, as opposed to the na\\\"ive split-by-form, we propose a\nsplit-by-lemma method to challenge the performance on existing benchmarks. Our\nexperiments with the three top-ranked systems on the SIGMORPHON's 2020\nshared-task show that the lemma-split presents an average drop of 30 percentage\npoints in macro-average for the 90 languages included. The effect is most\nsignificant for low-resourced languages with a drop as high as 95 points, but\neven high-resourced languages lose about 10 points on average.

In this paper, we propose a new speech\nanti-spoofing model named ResWavegram-Resnet (RW-Resnet). The model contains\ntwo parts, Conv1D Resblocks and backbone Resnet34. The Conv1D Resblock is based\non the Conv1D block with a residual connection. For the first part, we use the\nraw waveform as input and feed it to the stacked Conv1D Resblocks to get the\nResWavegram. Compared with traditional methods, ResWavegram keeps all the\ninformation from the audio signal and has a stronger ability in extracting\nfeatures. For the second part, the extracted features are fed to the backbone\nResnet34 for the spoofed or bonafide decision. The ASVspoof2019 logical access\n(LA) corpus is used to evaluate our proposed RW-Resnet.

    "abstract": "Extracting top-k keywords and documents using weighting schemes are popular\ntechniques employed in text mining and machine learning for different analysis\nand retrieval tasks. The weights are usually computed in the data preprocessing\nstep, as they are costly to update and keep track of all the modifications\nperformed on the dataset. Furthermore, computation errors are introduced when\nanalyzing only subsets of the dataset. Therefore, in a Big Data context, it is\ncrucial to lower the runtime of computing weighting schemes, without hindering\nthe analysis process and the accuracy of the machine learning algorithms. To\naddress this requirement for the task of top-k keywords and documents, it is\ncustomary to design benchmarks that compare weighting schemes within various\nconfigurations of distributed frameworks and database management systems. Thus,\nwe propose a generic document-oriented benchmark for storing textual data and\nconstructing weighting schemes (TextBenDS). Our benchmark offers a generic data\nmodel designed with a multidimensional approach for storing text documents. We\nalso propose using aggregation queries with various complexities and\nselectivities for constructing term weighting schemes, that are utilized in\nextracting top-k keywords and documents. We evaluate the computing performance\nof the queries on several distributed environments set within the Apache Hadoop\necosystem. Our experimental results provide interesting insights.

    "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of deep learning on edge devices, compressing\nlarge neural networks to meet the hardware requirements of resource-constrained\ndevices became a significant research direction. Numerous compression\nmethodologies are currently being used to reduce the memory sizes and energy\nconsumption of neural networks. Knowledge distillation (KD) is among such\nmethodologies and it functions by using data samples to transfer the knowledge\ncaptured by a large model (teacher) to a smaller one(student). However, due to\nvarious reasons, the original training data might not be accessible at the\ncompression stage. Therefore, data-free model compression is an ongoing\nresearch problem that has been addressed by various works. In this paper, we\npoint out that catastrophic forgetting is a problem that can potentially be\nobserved in existing data-free distillation methods. Moreover, the sample\ngeneration strategies in some of these methods could result in a mismatch\nbetween the synthetic and real data distributions. To prevent such problems, we\npropose a data-free KD framework that maintains a dynamic collection of\ngenerated samples over time. Additionally, we add the constraint of matching\nthe real data distribution in sample generation strategies that target maximum\ninformation gain. Our experiments demonstrate that we can improve the accuracy\nof the student models obtained via KD when compared with state-of-the-art\napproaches on the SVHN, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR100 datasets.",

Although existing\nresearch has made some achievements, less attention has been paid to the\nresearch of heavy vehicles' LCD.

The survival function of LCD has been\nestimated, and the characteristic has been analyzed. Thereafter, the\nAccelerated Failure Time model is introduced to explore the influencing\nfactors. Results demonstrate that the MST value of passenger cars and heavy\nvehicles is about 5.51s and 6.08s.

This algorithm consists of a tactical layer\nplanner and an operational layer controller. The former generates a\nlocal-optimum trajectory. The comfort, efficiency, and safety of the LC vehicle\nand its surrounding vehicles are simultaneously satisfied in the optimization\nobjective function. The later is designed based on vehicle kinematics model and\nthe Model Predictive Control (MPC), which aims to minimize the tracking error\nand control increment. Combining macro-level and micro-level analysis, we\nverify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Our results demonstrate\nthat our proposed algorithm could greatly reduce the impact of LC maneuver on\ntraffic flow. This is reflected in the decrease of total loss for nearby\nvehicles (such as discomfort and speed reduction), and the increase of traffic\nspeed and throughput within the LC area. In addition, in order to guide the\npractical application of our algorithm, we employ the HighD dataset to validate\nthe algorithm. This research could also be regarded as a preliminary\nfoundational work to develop locally-optimal automatic LC algorithm. We\nanticipate that this research could provide valuable insights into autonomous\ndriving technology.",

    "abstract": "We train embodied neural networks to plan and navigate unseen complex 3D\nenvironments, emphasising real-world deployment. Rather than requiring prior\nknowledge of the agent or environment, the planner learns to model the state\ntransitions and rewards. To avoid the potentially hazardous trial-and-error of\nreinforcement learning, we focus on differentiable planners such as Value\nIteration Networks (VIN), which are trained offline from safe expert\ndemonstrations. Although they work well in small simulations, we address two\nmajor limitations that hinder their deployment. First, we observed that current\ndifferentiable planners struggle to plan long-term in environments with a high\nbranching complexity. While they should ideally learn to assign low rewards to\nobstacles to avoid collisions, we posit that the constraints imposed on the\nnetwork are not strong enough to guarantee the network to learn sufficiently\nlarge penalties for every possible collision. We thus impose a structural\nconstraint on the value iteration, which explicitly learns to model any\nimpossible actions. Secondly, we extend the model to work with a limited\nperspective camera under translation and rotation, which is crucial for real\nrobot deployment. Many VIN-like planners assume a 360 degrees or overhead view\nwithout rotation. In contrast, our method uses a memory-efficient lattice map\nto aggregate CNN embeddings of partial observations, and models the rotational\ndynamics explicitly using a 3D state-space grid (translation and rotation). Our\nproposals significantly improve semantic navigation and exploration on several\n2D and 3D environments, succeeding in settings that are otherwise challenging\nfor this class of methods. As far as we know, we are the first to successfully\nperform differentiable planning on the difficult Active Vision Dataset,\nconsisting of real images captured from a robot.",

Although the past few\nyears have witnessed intense algorithmic development, accomplishing scalability\nremains the holy grail.

We\nimplement these improvements in the state-of-the-art framework, called Manthan.\nThe proposed framework is called Manthan2.

    "abstract": "Domain adaptation (DA) paves the way for label annotation and dataset bias\nissues by the knowledge transfer from a label-rich source domain to a related\nbut unlabeled target domain. A mainstream of DA methods is to align the feature\ndistributions of the two domains. However, the majority of them focus on the\nentire image features where irrelevant semantic information, e.g., the messy\nbackground, is inevitably embedded. Enforcing feature alignments in such case\nwill negatively influence the correct matching of objects and consequently lead\nto the semantically negative transfer due to the confusion of irrelevant\nsemantics. To tackle this issue, we propose Semantic Concentration for Domain\nAdaptation (SCDA), which encourages the model to concentrate on the most\nprincipal features via the pair-wise adversarial alignment of prediction\ndistributions. Specifically, we train the classifier to class-wisely maximize\nthe prediction distribution divergence of each sample pair, which enables the\nmodel to find the region with large differences among the same class of\nsamples. Meanwhile, the feature extractor attempts to minimize that\ndiscrepancy, which suppresses the features of dissimilar regions among the same\nclass of samples and accentuates the features of principal parts. As a general\nmethod, SCDA can be easily integrated into various DA methods as a regularizer\nto further boost their performance. Extensive experiments on the cross-domain\nbenchmarks show the efficacy of SCDA.",

A master server owns two private matrices $\\mA$\nand $\\mB$ and hires worker nodes to help computing their multiplication. The\nmatrices should remain information-theoretically private from the workers. Some\nof the workers are malicious and return corrupted results to the master. This\nwork is motivated by the literature on myopic adversaries in network coding and\ndistributed storage. Security beyond the Singleton bound is possible when the\nadversary has limited knowledge about the master's data and probabilistic\ndecoding is acceptable. The key observation in this setting is that the master\nis the sender and the receiver. Therefore, the master enjoys a plethora of\nadvantages that enable coding for security beyond the Singleton bound.\nWe design a framework for security against malicious adversaries in private\nmatrix-matrix multiplication. Our main goal is to apply this security framework\nto schemes with adaptive rates previously introduced by a subset of the\nauthors. Adaptive schemes divide the workers into clusters and thus provide\nflexibility in trading decoding complexity for efficiency. Checking the\nintegrity of the computation per cluster has low complexity but costs deleting\nthe results of a whole cluster with at least one malicious worker. Checking the\nintegrity of the results per worker is more complex but allows an efficient use\nof the non-malicious workers. Our scheme, called SRPM3, provides a\ncomputationally efficient security check that detects malicious workers with\nhigh probability and can tolerate the presence of an arbitrary number of\nmalicious workers.

A few KGE techniques address\ninterpretability, i.e., mapping the connectivity patterns of the relations\n(i.e., symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, and composition) to a geometric\ninterpretation such as rotations. Other approaches model the representations in\nhigher dimensional space such as four-dimensional space (4D) to enhance the\nability to infer the connectivity patterns (i.e., expressiveness). However,\nmodeling relation and entity in a 4D space often comes at the cost of\ninterpretability. This paper proposes HopfE, a novel KGE approach aiming to\nachieve the interpretability of inferred relations in the four-dimensional\nspace. We first model the structural embeddings in 3D Euclidean space and view\nthe relation operator as an SO(3) rotation. Next, we map the entity embedding\nvector from a 3D space to a 4D hypersphere using the inverse Hopf Fibration, in\nwhich we embed the semantic information from the KG ontology. Thus, HopfE\nconsiders the structural and semantic properties of the entities without losing\nexpressivity and interpretability.

    "title": "Learning from Matured Dumb Teacher for Fine Generalization",
    "abstract": "The flexibility of decision boundaries in neural networks that are unguided\nby training data is a well-known problem typically resolved with generalization\nmethods. A surprising result from recent knowledge distillation (KD) literature\nis that random, untrained, and equally structured teacher networks can also\nvastly improve generalization performance. It raises the possibility of\nexistence of undiscovered assumptions useful for generalization on an uncertain\nregion. In this paper, we shed light on the assumptions by analyzing decision\nboundaries and confidence distributions of both simple and KD-based\ngeneralization methods. Assuming that a decision boundary exists to represent\nthe most general tendency of distinction on an input sample space (i.e., the\nsimplest hypothesis), we show the various limitations of methods when using the\nhypothesis. To resolve these limitations, we propose matured dumb teacher based\nKD, conservatively transferring the hypothesis for generalization of the\nstudent without massive destruction of trained information. In practical\nexperiments on feed-forward and convolution neural networks for image\nclassification tasks on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, the proposed\nmethod shows stable improvement to the best test performance in the grid search\nof hyperparameters. The analysis and results imply that the proposed method can\nprovide finer generalization than existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Common deep neural networks (DNNs) for image classification have been shown\nto rely on shortcut opportunities (SO) in the form of predictive and\neasy-to-represent visual factors. This is known as shortcut learning and leads\nto impaired generalization. In this work, we show that common DNNs also suffer\nfrom shortcut learning when predicting only basic visual object factors of\nvariation (FoV) such as shape, color, or texture. We argue that besides\nshortcut opportunities, generalization opportunities (GO) are also an inherent\npart of real-world vision data and arise from partial independence between\npredicted classes and FoVs. We also argue that it is necessary for DNNs to\nexploit GO to overcome shortcut learning. Our core contribution is to introduce\nthe Diagnostic Vision Benchmark suite DiagViB-6, which includes datasets and\nmetrics to study a network's shortcut vulnerability and generalization\ncapability for six independent FoV. In particular, DiagViB-6 allows controlling\nthe type and degree of SO and GO in a dataset. We benchmark a wide range of\npopular vision architectures and show that they can exploit GO only to a\nlimited extent.",

    "abstract": "Recognizing and localizing objects in the 3D space is a crucial ability for\nan AI agent to perceive its surrounding environment. While significant progress\nhas been achieved with expensive LiDAR point clouds, it poses a great challenge\nfor 3D object detection given only a monocular image. While there exist\ndifferent alternatives for tackling this problem, it is found that they are\neither equipped with heavy networks to fuse RGB and depth information or\nempirically ineffective to process millions of pseudo-LiDAR points. With\nin-depth examination, we realize that these limitations are rooted in\ninaccurate object localization. In this paper, we propose a novel and\nlightweight approach, dubbed Progressive Coordinate Transforms (PCT) to\nfacilitate learning coordinate representations. Specifically, a localization\nboosting mechanism with confidence-aware loss is introduced to progressively\nrefine the localization prediction. In addition, semantic image repre-\nsentation is also exploited to compensate for the usage of patch proposals.\nDespite being lightweight and simple, our strategy leads to superior\nimprovements on the KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset monocular 3D detection\nbenchmarks. At the same time, our proposed PCT shows great generalization to\nmost coordinate- based 3D detection frameworks.

    "abstract": "The aerodynamic optimization process of cars requires multiple iterations\nbetween aerodynamicists and stylists. Response Surface Modeling and\nReduced-Order Modeling are commonly used to eliminate the overhead due to\nComputational Fluid Dynamics, leading to faster iterations. However, a primary\ndrawback of these models is that they can work only on the parametrized\ngeometric features they were trained with. This study evaluates if deep\nlearning models can predict the drag coefficient for an arbitrary input\ngeometry without explicit parameterization. We use two similar data sets based\non the publicly available DrivAer geometry for training. We use a modified\nU-Net architecture that uses Signed Distance Fields to represent the input\ngeometries. Our models outperform the existing models by at least 11% in\nprediction accuracy for the drag coefficient. We achieved this improvement by\ncombining multiple data sets that were created using different\nparameterizations, which is not possible with the methods currently used. We\nhave also shown that it is possible to predict velocity fields and drag\ncoefficient concurrently and that simple data augmentation methods can improve\nthe results. In addition, we have performed an occlusion sensitivity study on\nour models to understand what information is used to make predictions. From the\nocclusion sensitivity study, we showed that the models were able to identify\nthe geometric features and have discovered that the model has learned to\nexploit the global information present in the SDF. In contrast to the currently\noperational method, where design changes are restricted to the initially\ndefined parameters, this study brings surrogate models one step closer to the\nlong-term goal of having a model that can be used for approximate aerodynamic\nevaluation of unseen, arbitrary vehicle shapes, thereby providing complete\ndesign freedom to the vehicle stylists.",

Enabling PTMs training on low-quality devices, PatrickStar now makes\nPTM accessible to everyone.\nPatrickStar reduces memory requirements of computing platforms by using the\nCPU-GPU heterogeneous memory space to store model data, consisting of\nparameters, gradients, and optimizer states. We observe that the GPU memory\navailable for model data changes regularly, in a tide-like pattern, decreasing\nand increasing iteratively. However, the existing heterogeneous training works\ndo not take advantage of this pattern. Instead, they statically partition the\nmodel data among CPU and GPU, leading to both memory waste and memory abuse.

The functional perspective\ndistinguishes between a policy's functional representation (what are its\nsufficient statistics) and its parameterization (how are these statistics\nrepresented) and naturally results in computationally efficient off-policy\nupdates. For simple policy parameterizations, the FMA-PG framework ensures that\nthe optimal policy is a fixed point of the updates. It also allows us to handle\ncomplex policy parameterizations (e.g., neural networks) while guaranteeing\npolicy improvement. Our framework unifies several PG methods and opens the way\nfor designing sample-efficient variants of existing methods.

Without\nappropriately tuned $\\ell_2$ regularization or weight decay, such networks have\nthe tendency to make output scores (logits) and network weights large, causing\ntraining loss to become too small and the network to lose its adaptivity\n(ability to move around) in the parameter space. Although regularization is\ntypically understood from an overfitting perspective, we highlight its role in\nmaking the network more adaptive and enabling it to escape more easily from\nweights that generalize poorly. To provide such a capability, we propose a\nmethod called Logit Attenuating Weight Normalization (LAWN), that can be\nstacked onto any gradient-based optimizer. LAWN controls the logits by\nconstraining the weight norms of layers in the final homogeneous sub-network.\nEmpirically, we show that the resulting LAWN variant of the optimizer makes a\ndeep network more adaptive to finding minimas with superior generalization\nperformance on large-scale image classification and recommender systems. While\nLAWN is particularly impressive in improving Adam, it greatly improves all\noptimizers when used with large batch sizes",

    "abstract": "A collection of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) -- such as air\nconditioners and water heaters -- can vary their power consumption within\nlimits to help the balancing authority of a power grid maintain demand supply\nbalance. Doing so requires loads to coordinate their on/off decisions so that\nthe aggregate power consumption profile tracks a grid-supplied reference. At\nthe same time, each consumer's quality of service (QoS) must be maintained.\nWhile there is a large body of work on TCL coordination, there are several\nlimitations. One is that they do not provide guarantees on the reference\ntracking performance and QoS maintenance. A second limitation of past work is\nthat they do not provide a means to compute a suitable reference signal for\npower demand of a collection of TCLs. In this work we provide a framework that\naddresses these weaknesses. The framework enables coordination of an arbitrary\nnumber of TCLs that: (i) is computationally efficient, (ii) is implementable at\nthe TCLs with local feedback and low communication, and (iii) enables reference\ntracking by the collection while ensuring that temperature and cycling\nconstraints are satisfied at every TCL at all times. The framework is based on\na Markov model obtained by discretizing a pair of Fokker-Planck equations\nderived in earlier work by Malhame and Chong [21]. We then use this model to\ndesign randomized policies for TCLs. The balancing authority broadcasts the\nsame policy to all TCLs, and each TCL implements this policy which requires\nonly local measurement to make on/off decisions.

    "abstract": "TODO comments are very widely used by software developers to describe their\npending tasks during software development. However, after performing the task\ndevelopers sometimes neglect or simply forget to remove the TODO comment,\nresulting in obsolete TODO comments. These obsolete TODO comments can confuse\ndevelopment teams and may cause the introduction of bugs in the future,\ndecreasing the software's quality and maintainability. In this work, we propose\na novel model, named TDCleaner (TODO comment Cleaner), to identify obsolete\nTODO comments in software projects. TDCleaner can assist developers in\njust-in-time checking of TODO comments status and avoid leaving obsolete TODO\ncomments. Our approach has two main stages: offline learning and online\nprediction. During offline learning, we first automatically establish\n<code_change, todo_comment, commit_msg> training samples and leverage three\nneural encoders to capture the semantic features of TODO comment, code change\nand commit message respectively. TDCleaner then automatically learns the\ncorrelations and interactions between different encoders to estimate the final\nstatus of the TODO comment. For online prediction, we check a TODO comment's\nstatus by leveraging the offline trained model to judge the TODO comment's\nlikelihood of being obsolete. We built our dataset by collecting TODO comments\nfrom the top-10,000 Python and Java Github repositories and evaluated TDCleaner\non them. Extensive experimental results show the promising performance of our\nmodel over a set of benchmarks. We also performed an in-the-wild evaluation\nwith real-world software projects, we reported 18 obsolete TODO comments\nidentified by TDCleaner to Github developers and 9 of them have already been\nconfirmed and removed by the developers, demonstrating the practical usage of\nour approach.",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuned language models use greedy decoding to answer reading\ncomprehension questions with relative success. However, this approach does not\nensure that the answer is a span in the given passage, nor does it guarantee\nthat it is the most probable one. Does greedy decoding actually perform worse\nthan an algorithm that does adhere to these properties? To study the\nperformance and optimality of greedy decoding, we present exact-extract, a\ndecoding algorithm that efficiently finds the most probable answer span in the\ncontext. We compare the performance of T5 with both decoding algorithms on\nzero-shot and few-shot extractive question answering. When no training examples\nare available, exact-extract significantly outperforms greedy decoding.\nHowever, greedy decoding quickly converges towards the performance of\nexact-extract with the introduction of a few training examples, becoming more\nextractive and increasingly likelier to generate the most probable span as the\ntraining set grows. We also show that self-supervised training can bias the\nmodel towards extractive behavior, increasing performance in the zero-shot\nsetting without resorting to annotated examples. Overall, our results suggest\nthat pretrained language models are so good at adapting to extractive question\nanswering, that it is often enough to fine-tune on a small training set for the\ngreedy algorithm to emulate the optimal decoding strategy.",

HACx outperforms either component method on its own, as well as an\nexisting approach to combining hierarchy and exploration, in a set of difficult\nsimulated robotics tasks. HACx is the first RL method to solve a sparse reward,\ncontinuous-control task that requires over 1,000 actions.",

    "abstract": "We propose a method that efficiently learns distributions over articulation\nmodel parameters directly from depth images without the need to know\narticulation model categories a priori. By contrast, existing methods that\nlearn articulation models from raw observations typically only predict point\nestimates of the model parameters, which are insufficient to guarantee the safe\nmanipulation of articulated objects. Our core contributions include a novel\nrepresentation for distributions over rigid body transformations and\narticulation model parameters based on screw theory, von Mises-Fisher\ndistributions, and Stiefel manifolds. Combining these concepts allows for an\nefficient, mathematically sound representation that implicitly satisfies the\nconstraints that rigid body transformations and articulations must adhere to.\nLeveraging this representation, we introduce a novel deep learning based\napproach, DUST-net, that performs category-independent articulation model\nestimation while also providing model uncertainties. We evaluate our approach\non several benchmarking datasets and real-world objects and compare its\nperformance with two current state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate\nthat DUST-net can successfully learn distributions over articulation models for\nnovel objects across articulation model categories, which generate point\nestimates with better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods and effectively\ncapture the uncertainty over predicted model parameters due to noisy inputs.",

Scene graphs, composed of\nnodes as objects and directed-edges as relationships among objects, offer an\nalternative representation of a scene that is more semantically grounded than\nimages. We hypothesize that a generative model for scene graphs might be able\nto learn the underlying semantic structure of real-world scenes more\neffectively than images, and hence, generate realistic novel scenes in the form\nof scene graphs. In this work, we explore a new task for the unconditional\ngeneration of semantic scene graphs. We develop a deep auto-regressive model\ncalled SceneGraphGen which can directly learn the probability distribution over\nlabelled and directed graphs using a hierarchical recurrent architecture. The\nmodel takes a seed object as input and generates a scene graph in a sequence of\nsteps, each step generating an object node, followed by a sequence of\nrelationship edges connecting to the previous nodes. We show that the scene\ngraphs generated by SceneGraphGen are diverse and follow the semantic patterns\nof real-world scenes.

    "abstract": "How do the neural networks distinguish two images? It is of critical\nimportance to understand the matching mechanism of deep models for developing\nreliable intelligent systems for many risky visual applications such as\nsurveillance and access control. However, most existing deep metric learning\nmethods match the images by comparing feature vectors, which ignores the\nspatial structure of images and thus lacks interpretability. In this paper, we\npresent a deep interpretable metric learning (DIML) method for more transparent\nembedding learning. Unlike conventional metric learning methods based on\nfeature vector comparison, we propose a structural matching strategy that\nexplicitly aligns the spatial embeddings by computing an optimal matching flow\nbetween feature maps of the two images. Our method enables deep models to learn\nmetrics in a more human-friendly way, where the similarity of two images can be\ndecomposed to several part-wise similarities and their contributions to the\noverall similarity. Our method is model-agnostic, which can be applied to\noff-the-shelf backbone networks and metric learning methods. We evaluate our\nmethod on three major benchmarks of deep metric learning including CUB200-2011,\nCars196, and Stanford Online Products, and achieve substantial improvements\nover popular metric learning methods with better interpretability.

Those explanations are based on the assumption that women\ntake on the majority of childcare responsibilities, and take the same level of\nleave at the birth of a child. Changing social dynamics around parenting has\nseen fathers increasingly take an active role in parenting. This demands a more\nnuanced approach to understanding how parenting affects both men and women.\nUsing a global survey of 11,226 academic parents, this study investigates the\neffect of parental engagement (Lead, Dual (shared), and Satellite parenting),\nand partner type, on measures of research productivity and impact for men and\nfor women. It also analyzes the effect of different levels of parental leave on\nacademic productivity. Results show that the parenting penalty for men and\nwomen is a function of the level of engagement in parenting activities. Men who\nserve in lead roles suffer similar penalties, but women are more likely to\nserve in lead parenting roles and to be more engaged across time and tasks.\nTaking a period of parental leave is associated with higher levels of\nproductivity, however the productivity advantage is lost for the US-sample at 6\nmonths, and at 12-months for the non-US sample.

We illustrate the method with\nthe 2D acoustic wave equation and demonstrate the method's applicability to\nseismic tomography, using reverse mode automatic differentiation to compute\ngradients of the wavefield with respect to the velocity structure. The\ndeveloped procedure is nearly an order of magnitude faster than using\nconventional numerical methods for full waveform inversion.",

In this paper, we develop a neural model for speech\ndereverberation using the long-term sub-band envelopes of speech. The sub-band\nenvelopes are derived using frequency domain linear prediction (FDLP) which\nperforms an autoregressive estimation of the Hilbert envelopes. The neural\ndereverberation model estimates the envelope gain which when applied to\nreverberant signals suppresses the late reflection components in the far-field\nsignal. The dereverberated envelopes are used for feature extraction in speech\nrecognition. Further, the sequence of steps involved in envelope\ndereverberation, feature extraction and acoustic modeling for ASR can be\nimplemented as a single neural processing pipeline which allows the joint\nlearning of the dereverberation network and the acoustic model. Several\nexperiments are performed on the REVERB challenge dataset, CHiME-3 dataset and\nVOiCES dataset. In these experiments, the joint learning of envelope\ndereverberation and acoustic model yields significant performance improvements\nover the baseline ASR system based on log-mel spectrogram as well as other past\napproaches for dereverberation (average relative improvements of 10-24% over\nthe baseline system).

    "abstract": "After a decade of research, we developed a prototype device and\nexperimentally demonstrated that the direct phi q interaction could be\nmemristive, as predicted by Chua in 1971.

Our work represents a\nstep forward in terms of experimentally verifying the memristive flux charge\ninteraction but we have not reached the final because this prototype still\nsuffers from two serious limitations: 1, a superficial but dominant inductor\neffect (behind which the above memristive fingerprints hide) due to its\ninductor-like core structure, and 2. bistability and dynamic sweep of a\ncontinuous resistance range. In this article, we also discuss how to make a\nfully functioning ideal memristor with multiple or an infinite number of stable\nstates and no parasitic inductance, and give a number of suggestions, such as\nopen structure, nanoscale size, magnetic materials with cubic anisotropy (or\neven isotropy), and sequential switching of the magnetic domains. Additionally,\nwe respond to a recent challenge from arXiv.org that claims that our device is\nsimply an inductor with memory since our device did not pass their designed\ncapacitor-memristor circuit test. Contrary to their conjecture that an ideal\nmemristor may not exist or may be a purely mathematical concept, we remain\noptimistic that researchers will discover an ideal memristor in nature or make\none in the laboratory based on our current work.",
