    "abstract": "Autoregressive exogenous (ARX) systems are the general class of input-output\ndynamical systems used for modeling stochastic linear dynamical systems (LDS)\nincluding partially observable LDS such as LQG systems. In this work, we study\nthe problem of system identification and adaptive control of unknown ARX\nsystems. We provide finite-time learning guarantees for the ARX systems under\nboth open-loop and closed-loop data collection. Using these guarantees, we\ndesign adaptive control algorithms for unknown ARX systems with arbitrary\nstrongly convex or convex quadratic regulating costs. Under strongly convex\ncost functions, we design an adaptive control algorithm based on online\ngradient descent to design and update the controllers that are constructed via\na convex controller reparametrization. We show that our algorithm has\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret via explore and commit approach and if\nthe model estimates are updated in epochs using closed-loop data collection, it\nattains the optimal regret of $\\text{polylog}(T)$ after $T$ time-steps of\ninteraction. For the case of convex quadratic cost functions, we propose an\nadaptive control algorithm that deploys the optimism in the face of uncertainty\nprinciple to design the controller. In this setting, we show that the explore\nand commit approach has a regret upper bound of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$,\nand the adaptive control with continuous model estimate updates attains\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret after $T$ time-steps.",

    "abstract": "Learning transferable and domain adaptive feature representations from videos\nis important for video-relevant tasks such as action recognition. Existing\nvideo domain adaptation methods mainly rely on adversarial feature alignment,\nwhich has been derived from the RGB image space. However, video data is usually\nassociated with multi-modal information, e.g., RGB and optical flow, and thus\nit remains a challenge to design a better method that considers the cross-modal\ninputs under the cross-domain adaptation setting. To this end, we propose a\nunified framework for video domain adaptation, which simultaneously regularizes\ncross-modal and cross-domain feature representations. Specifically, we treat\neach modality in a domain as a view and leverage the contrastive learning\ntechnique with properly designed sampling strategies. As a result, our\nobjectives regularize feature spaces, which originally lack the connection\nacross modalities or have less alignment across domains. We conduct experiments\non domain adaptive action recognition benchmark datasets, i.e., UCF, HMDB, and\nEPIC-Kitchens, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our components against\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.",

The classification of emotions is based on standard and well-known\ncorpora and the evaluation of customer satisfaction is based on recordings of\nreal opinions given by customers about the received service during phone calls\nwith call-center agents. The feature sets considered in this study include two\nspeaker models, namely x-vectors and i-vectors, and also the well known feature\nset introduced in the Interspeech 2010 Paralinguistics Challenge (I2010PC).\nAdditionally, we introduce the use of phonation, articulation and prosody\nfeatures extracted with the DisVoice framework as alternative feature sets to\nrobustly model emotions and customer satisfaction from speech. The results\nindicate that the I2010PC feature set is the best approach to classify emotions\nin the standard databases typically used in the literature. When considering\nthe recordings collected in the call-center, without any control over the\nacoustic conditions, the best results are obtained with our articulation\nfeatures. The I2010PC feature set includes 1584 measures while the articulation\napproach only includes 488 measures.

    "abstract": "Motion planning is a fundamental problem and focuses on finding control\ninputs that enable a robot to reach a goal region while safely avoiding\nobstacles. However, in many situations, the state of the system may not be\nknown but only estimated using, for instance, a Kalman filter. This results in\na novel motion planning problem where safety must be ensured in the presence of\nstate estimation uncertainty. Previous approaches to this problem are either\nconservative or integrate state estimates optimistically which leads to\nnon-robust solutions. Optimistic solutions require frequent replanning to not\nendanger the safety of the system. We propose a new formulation to this problem\nwith the aim to be robust to state estimation errors while not being overly\nconservative. In particular, we formulate a stochastic optimal control problem\nthat contains robustified risk-aware safety constraints by incorporating\nrobustness margins to account for state estimation errors. We propose a novel\nsampling-based approach that builds trees exploring the reachable space of\nGaussian distributions that capture uncertainty both in state estimation and in\nfuture measurements. We provide robustness guarantees and show, both in theory\nand simulations, that the induced robustness margins constitute a trade-off\nbetween conservatism and robustness for planning under estimation uncertainty\nthat allows to control the frequency of replanning.",

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection progresses via delamination of the medial layer of the\nwall. Notwithstanding the complexity of this process, insight has been gleaned\nby studying in vitro and in silico the progression of dissection driven by\nquasi-static pressurization of the intramural space by fluid injection, which\ndemonstrates that the differential propensity of dissection can be affected by\nspatial distributions of structurally significant interlamellar struts that\nconnect adjacent elastic lamellae. In particular, diverse histological\nmicrostructures may lead to differential mechanical behavior during dissection,\nincluding the pressure--volume relationship of the injected fluid and the\ndisplacement field between adjacent lamellae. In this study, we develop a\ndata-driven surrogate model for the delamination process for differential strut\ndistributions using DeepONet, a new operator--regression neural network. The\nsurrogate model is trained to predict the pressure--volume curve of the\ninjected fluid and the damage progression field of the wall given a spatial\ndistribution of struts, with in silico data generated with a phase-field finite\nelement model. The results show that DeepONet can provide accurate predictions\nfor diverse strut distributions, indicating that this composite branch-trunk\nneural network can effectively extract the underlying functional relationship\nbetween distinctive microstructures and their mechanical properties. More\nbroadly, DeepONet can facilitate surrogate model-based analyses to quantify\nbiological variability, improve inverse design, and predict mechanical\nproperties based on multi-modality experimental data.",

    "abstract": "Building systems with capability of natural language understanding (NLU) has\nbeen one of the oldest areas of AI. An essential component of NLU is to detect\nlogical succession of events contained in a text. The task of sentence ordering\nis proposed to learn succession of events with applications in AI tasks. The\nperformance of previous works employing statistical methods is poor, while the\nneural networks-based approaches are in serious need of large corpora for model\nlearning. In this paper, we propose a method for sentence ordering which does\nnot need a training phase and consequently a large corpus for learning. To this\nend, we generate sentence embedding using BERT pre-trained model and measure\nsentence similarity using cosine similarity score. We suggest this score as an\nindicator of sequential events' level of coherence. We finally sort the\nsentences through brute-force search to maximize overall similarities of the\nsequenced sentences. Our proposed method outperformed other baselines on\nROCStories, a corpus of 5-sentence human-made stories. The method is\nspecifically more efficient than neural network-based methods when no huge\ncorpus is available. Among other advantages of this method are its\ninterpretability and needlessness to linguistic knowledge.",

Assuming the absence of outliers, the standard\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm efficiently computes the optimal alignment\nbetween two (generally) variable-length sequences. While DTW is robust to\ntemporal shifts and dilations of the signal, it fails to align sequences in a\nmeaningful way in the presence of outliers that can be arbitrarily interspersed\nin the sequences. To address this problem, we introduce Drop-DTW, a novel\nalgorithm that aligns the common signal between the sequences while\nautomatically dropping the outlier elements from the matching. The entire\nprocedure is implemented as a single dynamic program that is efficient and\nfully differentiable. In our experiments, we show that Drop-DTW is a robust\nsimilarity measure for sequence retrieval and demonstrate its effectiveness as\na training loss on diverse applications. With Drop-DTW, we address temporal\nstep localization on instructional videos, representation learning from noisy\nvideos, and cross-modal representation learning for audio-visual retrieval and\nlocalization.

    "abstract": "Adversarial defenses train deep neural networks to be invariant to the input\nperturbations from adversarial attacks. Almost all defense strategies achieve\nthis invariance through adversarial training i.e. training on inputs with\nadversarial perturbations. Although adversarial training is successful at\nmitigating adversarial attacks, the behavioral differences between\nadversarially-trained (AT) models and standard models are still poorly\nunderstood. Motivated by a recent study on learning robustness without input\nperturbations by distilling an AT model, we explore what is learned during\nadversarial training by analyzing the distribution of logits in AT models. We\nidentify three logit characteristics essential to learning adversarial\nrobustness. First, we provide a theoretical justification for the finding that\nadversarial training shrinks two important characteristics of the logit\ndistribution: the max logit values and the \"logit gaps\" (difference between the\nlogit max and next largest values) are on average lower for AT models. Second,\nwe show that AT and standard models differ significantly on which samples are\nhigh or low confidence, then illustrate clear qualitative differences by\nvisualizing samples with the largest confidence difference. Finally, we find\nlearning information about incorrect classes to be essential to learning\nrobustness by manipulating the non-max logit information during distillation\nand measuring the impact on the student's robustness. Our results indicate that\nlearning some adversarial robustness without input perturbations requires a\nmodel to learn specific sample-wise confidences and incorrect class orderings\nthat follow complex distributions.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are known to exhibit a `double descent' behavior as the\nnumber of parameters increases. Recently, it has also been shown that an\n`epochwise double descent' effect exists in which the generalization error\ninitially drops, then rises, and finally drops again with increasing training\ntime. This presents a practical problem in that the amount of time required for\ntraining is long, and early stopping based on validation performance may result\nin suboptimal generalization. In this work we develop an analytically tractable\nmodel of epochwise double descent that allows us to characterise theoretically\nwhen this effect is likely to occur. This model is based on the hypothesis that\nthe training data contains features that are slow to learn but informative. We\nthen show experimentally that deep neural networks behave similarly to our\ntheoretical model. Our findings indicate that epochwise double descent requires\na critical amount of noise to occur, but above a second critical noise level\nearly stopping remains effective. Using insights from theory, we give two\nmethods by which epochwise double descent can be removed: one that removes slow\nto learn features from the input and reduces generalization performance, and\nanother that instead modifies the training dynamics and matches or exceeds the\ngeneralization performance of standard training. Taken together, our results\nsuggest a new picture of how epochwise double descent emerges from the\ninterplay between the dynamics of training and noise in the training data.",

    "title": "Semi-Decentralized Network Slicing for Reliable V2V Service  Provisioning: A Model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach",
    "abstract": "Applying of network slicing in vehicular networks becomes a promising\nparadigm to support emerging Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) applications with diverse\nquality of service (QoS) requirements. However, achieving effective network\nslicing in dynamic vehicular communications still faces many challenges,\nparticularly time-varying traffic of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) services and the\nfast-changing network topology. By leveraging the widely deployed LTE\ninfrastructures, we propose a semi-decentralized network slicing framework in\nthis paper based on the C-V2X Mode-4 standard to provide customized network\nslices for diverse V2V services. With only the long-term and partial\ninformation of vehicular networks, eNodeB (eNB) can infer the underlying\nnetwork situation and then intelligently adjust the configuration for each\nslice to ensure the long-term QoS performance. Under the coordination of eNB,\neach vehicle can autonomously select radio resources for its V2V transmission\nin a decentralized manner. Specifically, the slicing control at the eNB is\nrealized by a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which is\na convergence of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and actor-critic DRL. Compared\nto the existing DRL algorithms, the proposed DRL neither requires any prior\nknowledge nor assumes any statistical model of vehicular networks. Furthermore,\nsimulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed intelligent network\nslicing scheme.",

    "title": "DeepFlow: Abnormal Traffic Flow Detection Using Siamese Networks",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, many cities are equipped with surveillance systems and traffic\ncontrol centers to monitor vehicular traffic for road safety and efficiency.\nThe monitoring process is mostly done manually which is inefficient and\nexpensive. In recent years, several data-driven solutions have been proposed in\nthe literature to automatically analyze traffic flow data using machine\nlearning techniques. However, existing solutions require large and\ncomprehensive datasets for training which are not readily available, thus\nlimiting their application. In this paper, we develop a traffic anomaly\ndetection system, referred to as DeepFlow, based on Siamese neural networks,\nwhich are suitable in scenarios where only small datasets are available for\ntraining. Our model can detect abnormal traffic flows by analyzing the\ntrajectory data collected from the vehicles in a fleet. To evaluate DeepFlow,\nwe use realistic vehicular traffic simulations in SUMO. Our results show that\nDeepFlow detects abnormal traffic patterns with an F1 score of 78%, while\noutperforming other existing approaches including: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW),\nGlobal Alignment Kernels (GAK), and iForest.",

    "abstract": "In the $G$-sampling problem, the goal is to output an index $i$ of a vector\n$f \\in\\mathbb{R}^n$, such that for all coordinates $j \\in [n]$,\n\\[\\textbf{Pr}[i=j] = (1 \\pm \\epsilon) \\frac{G(f_j)}{\\sum_{k\\in[n]} G(f_k)} +\n\\gamma,\\] where $G:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ is some non-negative\nfunction. If $\\epsilon = 0$ and $\\gamma = 1/\\text{poly}(n)$, the sampler is\ncalled perfect. In the data stream model, $f$ is defined implicitly by a\nsequence of updates to its coordinates, and the goal is to design such a\nsampler in small space. Jayaram and Woodruff (FOCS 2018) gave the first perfect\n$L_p$ samplers in turnstile streams, where $G(x)=|x|^p$, using\n$\\text{polylog}(n)$ space for $p\\in(0,2]$. However, to date all known sampling\nalgorithms are not truly perfect, since their output distribution is only\npoint-wise $\\gamma = 1/\\text{poly}(n)$ close to the true distribution. This\nsmall error can be significant when samplers are run many times on successive\nportions of a stream, and leak potentially sensitive information about the data\nstream. In this work, we initiate the study of truly perfect samplers, with\n$\\epsilon = \\gamma = 0$, and comprehensively investigate their complexity in\nthe data stream and sliding window models.\nAbstract truncated due to arXiv limits; please see paper for full abstract.",

    "title": "A functional skeleton transfer",
    "abstract": "The animation community has spent significant effort trying to ease rigging\nprocedures. This is necessitated because the increasing availability of 3D data\nmakes manual rigging infeasible. However, object animations involve\nunderstanding elaborate geometry and dynamics, and such knowledge is hard to\ninfuse even with modern data-driven techniques. Automatic rigging methods do\nnot provide adequate control and cannot generalize in the presence of unseen\nartifacts. As an alternative, one can design a system for one shape and then\ntransfer it to other objects. In previous work, this has been implemented by\nsolving the dense point-to-point correspondence problem. Such an approach\nrequires a significant amount of supervision, often placing hundreds of\nlandmarks by hand. This paper proposes a functional approach for skeleton\ntransfer that uses limited information and does not require a complete match\nbetween the geometries. To do so, we suggest a novel representation for the\nskeleton properties, namely the functional regressor, which is compact and\ninvariant to different discretizations and poses. We consider our functional\nregressor a new operator to adopt in intrinsic geometry pipelines for encoding\nthe pose information, paving the way for several new applications. We\nnumerically stress our method on a large set of different shapes and object\nclasses, providing qualitative and numerical evaluations of precision and\ncomputational efficiency. Finally, we show a preliminar transfer of the\ncomplete rigging scheme, introducing a promising direction for future\nexplorations.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which generalize the deep neural networks to\ngraph-structured data, have achieved great success in modeling graphs. However,\nas an extension of deep learning for graphs, GNNs lack explainability, which\nlargely limits their adoption in scenarios that demand the transparency of\nmodels. Though many efforts are taken to improve the explainability of deep\nlearning, they mainly focus on i.i.d data, which cannot be directly applied to\nexplain the predictions of GNNs because GNNs utilize both node features and\ngraph topology to make predictions. There are only very few work on the\nexplainability of GNNs and they focus on post-hoc explanations. Since post-hoc\nexplanations are not directly obtained from the GNNs, they can be biased and\nmisrepresent the true explanations. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel\nproblem of self-explainable GNNs which can simultaneously give predictions and\nexplanations. We propose a new framework which can find $K$-nearest labeled\nnodes for each unlabeled node to give explainable node classification, where\nnearest labeled nodes are found by interpretable similarity module in terms of\nboth node similarity and local structure similarity. Extensive experiments on\nreal-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework for explainable node classification.",

    "abstract": "Existing machines are functionally specific tools that were made for easy\nprediction and control. Tomorrow's machines may be closer to biological systems\nin their mutability, resilience, and autonomy. But first they must be capable\nof learning, and retaining, new information without repeated exposure to it.\nPast efforts to engineer such systems have sought to build or regulate\nartificial neural networks using task-specific modules with constrained\ncircumstances of application. This has not yet enabled continual learning over\nlong sequences of previously unseen data without corrupting existing knowledge:\na problem known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we introduce a\nsystem that can learn sequentially over previously unseen datasets (ImageNet,\nCIFAR-100) with little forgetting over time. This is accomplished by regulating\nthe activity of weights in a convolutional neural network on the basis of\ninputs using top-down modulation generated by a second feed-forward neural\nnetwork. We find that our method learns continually under domain transfer with\nsparse bursts of activity in weights that are recycled across tasks, rather\nthan by maintaining task-specific modules. Sparse synaptic bursting is found to\nbalance enhanced and diminished activity in a way that facilitates adaptation\nto new inputs without corrupting previously acquired functions. This behavior\nemerges during a prior meta-learning phase in which regulated synapses are\nselectively disinhibited, or grown, from an initial state of uniform\nsuppression.",

Key elements of HyperGI include (1)\nthe use of two orthogonal test suites, (2) a dynamic leak detection approach\nwhich estimates and localizes potential leaks, and (3) a repair component that\nproduces a candidate patch using genetic improvement. We demonstrate the\nsuccessful use of HyperGI on several programs which have no failing functional\ntests. We manually examine the resulting patches and identify trade-offs and\nfuture directions for fully realizing our vision.",

    "title": "A Comparative Study of Vulnerability Reporting by Software Composition  Analysis Tools",
    "abstract": "Background: Modern software uses many third-party libraries and frameworks as\ndependencies. Known vulnerabilities in these dependencies are a potential\nsecurity risk. Software composition analysis (SCA) tools, therefore, are being\nincreasingly adopted by practitioners to keep track of vulnerable dependencies.\nAim: The goal of this study is to understand the difference in vulnerability\nreporting by various SCA tools. Understanding if and how existing SCA tools\ndiffer in their analysis may help security practitioners to choose the right\ntooling and identify future research needs. Method: We present an in-depth case\nstudy by comparing the analysis reports of 9 industry-leading SCA tools on a\nlarge web application, OpenMRS, composed of Maven (Java) and npm (JavaScript)\nprojects. Results: We find that the tools vary in their vulnerability\nreporting. The count of reported vulnerable dependencies ranges from 17 to 332\nfor Maven and from 32 to 239 for npm projects across the studied tools.\nSimilarly, the count of unique known vulnerabilities reported by the tools\nranges from 36 to 313 for Maven and from 45 to 234 for npm projects. Our manual\nanalysis of the tools' results suggest that accuracy of the vulnerability\ndatabase is a key differentiator for SCA tools. Conclusion: We recommend that\npractitioners should not rely on any single tool at the present, as that can\nresult in missing known vulnerabilities. We point out two research directions\nin the SCA space: i) establishing frameworks and metrics to identify false\npositives for dependency vulnerabilities; and ii) building automation\ntechnologies for continuous monitoring of vulnerability data from open source\npackage ecosystems.",

By introducing\na quadratic auxiliary variable, the original system is reformulated into an\nequivalent form with a modified quadratic energy, where the way of the\nintroduced variable naturally produces a quadratic invariant of the new system.\nA class of Runge-Kutta methods satisfying the symplectic condition is applied\nto discretize the reformulated model in time, arriving at arbitrarily\nhigh-order schemes, which naturally conserve the modified quadratic energy and\nthe produced quadratic invariant. Under the consistent initial condition, the\nproposed methods are rigorously proved to maintain the original energy\nconservation law of the Korteweg-de Vries equation. In order to match the high\norder precision of time, the Fourier pseudo-spectral method is employed for\nspatial discretization, resulting in fully discrete energy-preserving schemes.\nTo solve the proposed nonlinear schemes effectively, we present a very\nefficient practically-structure-preserving iterative technique, which not only\ngreatly saves the calculation cost, but also achieves the purpose of\npractically preserving structure. Ample numerical results are addressed to\nconfirm the expected order of accuracy, conservative property and efficiency of\nthe proposed schemes.

The goal is for a reliable justification protocol to emerge from\nthis game.

In recent years, promotion with quantifiable\nincentive has become a popular approach for increasing active users on such\nplatforms.

Image downsampling is a\ncommonly adopted technique to ensure the latency constraint is met. However,\nthis naive approach greatly restricts an object detector's capability to\nidentify small objects. In this paper, we propose an attentional approach that\nelastically magnifies certain regions while maintaining a small input canvas.\nThe magnified regions are those that are believed to have a high probability of\ncontaining an object, whose signal can come from a dataset-wide prior or\nframe-level prior computed from recent object predictions. The magnification is\nimplemented by a KDE-based mapping to transform the bounding boxes into warping\nparameters, which are then fed into an image sampler with anti-cropping\nregularization. The detector is then fed with the warped image and we apply a\ndifferentiable backward mapping to get bounding box outputs in the original\nspace.

However, the interaction of the two views is rarely explored.

Inspired by the\nmutual learning paradigm and binocular parallax, we propose a unified\nframework, namely Binocular Mutual Learning (BML), which achieves the\ncompatibility of the global view and the local view through both intra-view and\ncross-view modeling. Concretely, the global view learns in the whole class\nspace to capture rich inter-class relationships. Meanwhile, the local view\nlearns in the local class space within each episode, focusing on matching\npositive pairs correctly. In addition, cross-view mutual interaction further\npromotes the collaborative learning and the implicit exploration of useful\nknowledge from each other.

The permutation of distribution is\ncontrollable by tuning the filtering parameter that determines the \"head\" to\npermutate, achieving diversity-aware sampling. We find that even when a large\nportion of filtered vocabulary is randomized, it can actually generate fluent\npoetry but with notably higher novelty.

    "abstract": "Conventional machine learning methods typically assume that data is split\naccording to tasks, and the data in each task can be modeled by a single target\nfunction. However, this assumption is invalid in open-ended environments where\nno manual task definition is available. In this paper, we present a novel\nsupervised learning paradigm of learning from open-ended data. Open-ended data\ninherently requires multiple single-valued deterministic mapping functions to\ncapture all its input-output relations, exhibiting an essential structural\ndifference from conventional supervised data. We formally expound this\nstructural property with a novel concept termed as mapping rank, and show that\nopen-ended data poses a fundamental difficulty for conventional supervised\nlearning, since different data samples may conflict with each other if the\nmapping rank of data is larger than one. To address this issue, we devise an\nOpen-ended Supervised Learning (OSL) framework, of which the key innovation is\na subjective function that automatically allocates the data among multiple\ncandidate models to resolve the conflict, developing a natural cognition\nhierarchy. We demonstrate the efficacy of OSL both theoretically and\nempirically, and show that OSL achieves human-like task cognition without\ntask-level supervision.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new semantic communication mechanism, whose key idea is to\npreserve the semantic information instead of strictly securing the bit-level\nprecision. Starting by analyzing the defects of existing joint source channel\ncoding (JSCC) methods, we show that the commonly used bit-level metrics are\nvulnerable of catching important semantic meaning and structures. To address\nthis problem, we take advantage of learning from semantic similarity, instead\nof relying on conventional paired bit-level supervisions like cross entropy and\nbit error rate. However, to develop such a semantic communication system is\nindeed a nontrivial task, considering the nondifferentiability of most semantic\nmetrics as well as the instability from noisy channels. To further resolve\nthese issues, we put forward a reinforcement learning (RL)-based solution which\nallows us to simultaneously optimize any user-defined semantic measurement by\nusing the policy gradient technique, and to interact with the surrounding noisy\nenvironment in a natural way. We have testified the proposed method in the\nchallenging European-parliament dataset. Experiments on both AWGN and\nphase-invariant fading channel have confirmed the superiority of our method in\nrevealing the semantic meanings, and better handling the channel noise\nespecially in low-SNR situations. Apart from the experimental results, we\nfurther provide an indepth look at how the semantics model behaves, along with\nits superb generalization ability in real-life examples.

This article presents a control methodology for these\nsystems, comprising a control modeling approach and model predictive control\n(MPC) strategy. This methodology is demonstrated on the high-pressure side of a\nsimple supercritical CO2 cycle power block, composed of a variable-speed\ncompressor, heat exchanger, and fixed-speed turbine. The control model is\ndeveloped by applying timescale-separation arguments to a high-fidelity\nsimulation model and locally linearizing non-ideal-gas turbomachinery\nperformance maps. MPC is implemented by linearizing the control model online at\neach sampling instant. Closed-loop simulations with a full-order gas-dynamics\ntruth model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control methodology.\nIn response to load changes, the controller maintains high turbine inlet\ntemperatures while achieving net power output ramp rates in excess of 100% of\nnameplate output per minute. The controller often acts at the intersection of\nmotor torque, compressor surge, and turbine inlet temperature constraints, and\nperforms well from 35 to 105% of nameplate capacity with no parameter\nscheduling. Good performance and fast update rates are obtained via online\nlinearization.

One controls the balance between speech-maintenance\nand noise-removal in training phases, while the other controls SE power applied\nto specific downstream tasks in testing phases. Our intention is to alleviate\nthe problem that SE systems trained to improve speech quality often fail to\nimprove other downstream tasks, such as automatic speaker verification (ASV)\nand automatic speech recognition (ASR), because they do not share the same\nobjects. It is easy to apply the proposed dual-warping factors approach to any\nmask-based SE method, and it allows a single SE system to handle multiple tasks\nwithout task-dependent training. The effectiveness of our proposed approach has\nbeen confirmed on the SITW dataset for ASV evaluation and the LibriSpeech\ndataset for ASR and speech quality evaluations of 0-20dB. We show that\ndifferent warping values are necessary for a single SE to achieve optimal\nperformance w.r.t. the three tasks. With the use of task-dependent warping\nfactors, speech quality was improved by an 84.7% PESQ increase, ASV had a 22.4%\nEER reduction, and ASR had a 52.2% WER reduction, on 0dB speech.

Previous methods usually generate an initial image with sentence\nembedding and then refine it with fine-grained word embedding. Despite the\nsignificant progress, the 'aspect' information (e.g., red eyes) contained in\nthe text, referring to several words rather than a word that depicts 'a\nparticular part or feature of something', is often ignored, which is highly\nhelpful for synthesizing image details.

To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic\nAspect-awarE GAN (DAE-GAN) that represents text information comprehensively\nfrom multiple granularities, including sentence-level, word-level, and\naspect-level. Moreover, inspired by human learning behaviors, we develop a\nnovel Aspect-aware Dynamic Re-drawer (ADR) for image refinement, in which an\nAttended Global Refinement (AGR) module and an Aspect-aware Local Refinement\n(ALR) module are alternately employed. AGR utilizes word-level embedding to\nglobally enhance the previously generated image, while ALR dynamically employs\naspect-level embedding to refine image details from a local perspective.\nFinally, a corresponding matching loss function is designed to ensure the\ntext-image semantic consistency at different levels.

    "title": "A Matching Algorithm based on Image Attribute Transfer and Local  Features for Underwater Acoustic and Optical Images",
    "abstract": "In the field of underwater vision research, image matching between the sonar\nsensors and optical cameras has always been a challenging problem. Due to the\ndifference in the imaging mechanism between them, which are the gray value,\ntexture, contrast, etc. of the acoustic images and the optical images are also\nvariant in local locations, which makes the traditional matching method based\non the optical image invalid. Coupled with the difficulties and high costs of\nunderwater data acquisition, it further affects the research process of\nacousto-optic data fusion technology. In order to maximize the use of\nunderwater sensor data and promote the development of multi-sensor information\nfusion (MSIF), this study applies the image attribute transfer method based on\ndeep learning approach to solve the problem of acousto-optic image matching,\nthe core of which is to eliminate the imaging differences between them as much\nas possible. At the same time, the advanced local feature descriptor is\nintroduced to solve the challenging acousto-optic matching problem.\nExperimental results show that our proposed method could preprocess\nacousto-optic images effectively and obtain accurate matching results.\nAdditionally, the method is based on the combination of image depth semantic\nlayer, and it could indirectly display the local feature matching relationship\nbetween original image pair, which provides a new solution to the underwater\nmulti-sensor image matching problem.",

    "abstract": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) can be used as the assistance of speech\ncommunication between pilots and air-traffic controllers. Its application can\nsignificantly reduce the complexity of the task and increase the reliability of\ntransmitted information. Evidently, high accuracy predictions are needed to\nminimize the risk of errors. Especially, high accuracy is required in\nrecognition of key information, such as commands and callsigns, used to\nnavigate pilots. Our results prove that the surveillance data containing\ncallsigns can help to considerably improve the recognition of a callsign in an\nutterance when the weights of probable callsign n-grams are reduced per\nutterance. In this paper, we investigate two approaches: (1) G-boosting, when\ncallsigns weights are adjusted at language model level (G) and followed by the\ndynamic decoder with an on-the-fly composition, and (2) lattice rescoring when\ncallsign information is introduced on top of lattices generated using a\nconventional decoder. Boosting callsign n-grams with the combination of two\nmethods allowed us to gain 28.4% of absolute improvement in callsign\nrecognition accuracy and up to 74.2% of relative improvement in WER of callsign\nrecognition.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for industrial defect\ndetection that is modeled based on anomaly detection using point pattern data.\nMost recent works use \\textit{global features} for feature extraction to\nsummarize image content. However, global features are not robust against\nlighting and viewpoint changes and do not describe the image's geometrical\ninformation to be fully utilized in the manufacturing industry. To the best of\nour knowledge, we are the first to propose using transfer learning of\nlocal/point pattern features to overcome these limitations and capture\ngeometrical information of the image regions. We model these local/point\npattern features as a random finite set (RFS). In addition we propose RFS\nenergy, in contrast to RFS likelihood as anomaly score. The similarity\ndistribution of point pattern features of the normal sample has been modeled as\na multivariate Gaussian. Parameters learning of the proposed RFS energy does\nnot require any heavy computation. We evaluate the proposed approach on the\nMVTec AD dataset, a multi-object defect detection dataset. Experimental results\nshow the outstanding performance of our proposed approach compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods, and the proposed RFS energy outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art in the few shot learning settings.",

    "abstract": "The tensor train (TT) format enjoys appealing advantages in handling\nstructural high-order tensors. The recent decade has witnessed the wide\napplications of TT-format tensors from diverse disciplines, among which tensor\ncompletion has drawn considerable attention. Numerous fast algorithms,\nincluding the Riemannian gradient descent (RGrad) algorithm, have been proposed\nfor the TT-format tensor completion. However, the theoretical guarantees of\nthese algorithms are largely missing or sub-optimal, partly due to the\ncomplicated and recursive algebraic operations in TT-format decomposition.\nMoreover, existing results established for the tensors of other formats, for\nexample, Tucker and CP, are inapplicable because the algorithms treating\nTT-format tensors are substantially different and more involved. In this paper,\nwe provide, to our best knowledge, the first theoretical guarantees of the\nconvergence of RGrad algorithm for TT-format tensor completion, under a nearly\noptimal sample size condition. The RGrad algorithm converges linearly with a\nconstant contraction rate that is free of tensor condition number without the\nnecessity of re-conditioning. We also propose a novel approach, referred to as\nthe sequential second-order moment method, to attain a warm initialization\nunder a similar sample size requirement. As a byproduct, our result even\nsignificantly refines the prior investigation of RGrad algorithm for matrix\ncompletion. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical discovery and\nshowcase the computational speedup gained by the TT-format decomposition.",

    "abstract": "Assistant Based Speech Recognition (ABSR) for air traffic control is\ngenerally trained by pooling both Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) and pilot data.\nIn practice, this is motivated by the fact that the proportion of pilot data is\nlesser compared to ATCO while their standard language of communication is\nsimilar. However, due to data imbalance of ATCO and pilot and their varying\nacoustic conditions, the ASR performance is usually significantly better for\nATCOs than pilots. In this paper, we propose to (1) split the ATCO and pilot\ndata using an automatic approach exploiting ASR transcripts, and (2) consider\nATCO and pilot ASR as two separate tasks for Acoustic Model (AM) training. For\nspeaker role classification of ATCO and pilot data, a hypothesized ASR\ntranscript is generated with a seed model, subsequently used to classify the\nspeaker role based on the knowledge extracted from grammar defined by\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). This approach provides an\naverage speaker role identification accuracy of 83% for ATCO and pilot.\nFinally, we show that training AMs separately for each task, or using a\nmultitask approach is well suited for this data compared to AM trained by\npooling all data.",

However, the point feature may lack the information of the whole\nobject and lead to a misalignment between the object and the point feature.\nMeanwhile, the classification and regression tasks are sensitive to different\nobject regions, but their features are spatially aligned. In this paper, we\npropose a simple and plug-in operator that could generate aligned and\ndisentangled features for each task, respectively, without breaking the fully\nconvolutional manner. By predicting two task-aware point sets that are located\nin each sensitive region, this operator could disentangle the two tasks from\nthe spatial dimension, as well as align the point feature with the object. We\nalso reveal an interesting finding of the opposite effect of the long-range\nskip-connection for classification and regression, respectively. Based on the\nobject-aligned and task-disentangled operator (OAT), we propose OAT-Net, which\nexplicitly exploits point-set features for more accurate detection results.\nExtensive experiments on the MS-COCO dataset show that OAT can consistently\nboost different one-stage detectors by $\\sim$2 AP.

As these platforms enable the free manifestation of thoughts\nand facts in text, images and video, there is an extensive need to screen them\nto protect individuals and groups from offensive content targeted at them. Our\nwork intends to classify codemixed social media comments/posts in the Dravidian\nlanguages of Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam. We intend to improve offensive\nlanguage identification by generating pseudo-labels on the dataset.

The two datasets are\ncombined using the generated pseudo-labels to create a custom dataset called\nCMTRA. As Dravidian languages are under-resourced, our approach increases the\namount of training data for the language models. We fine-tune several recent\npretrained language models on the newly constructed dataset. We extract the\npretrained language embeddings and pass them onto recurrent neural networks. We\nobserve that fine-tuning ULMFiT on the custom dataset yields the best results\non the code-mixed test sets of all three languages.

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving has attracted much attention over the years but turns out\nto be harder than expected, probably due to the difficulty of labeled data\ncollection for model training. Self-supervised learning (SSL), which leverages\nunlabeled data only for representation learning, might be a promising way to\nimprove model performance. Existing SSL methods, however, usually rely on the\nsingle-centric-object guarantee, which may not be applicable for multi-instance\ndatasets such as street scenes. To alleviate this limitation, we raise two\nissues to solve: (1) how to define positive samples for cross-view consistency\nand (2) how to measure similarity in multi-instance circumstances. We first\nadopt an IoU threshold during random cropping to transfer global-inconsistency\nto local-consistency. Then, we propose two feature alignment methods to enable\n2D feature maps for multi-instance similarity measurement. Additionally, we\nadopt intra-image clustering with self-attention for further mining intra-image\nsimilarity and translation-invariance. Experiments show that, when pre-trained\non Waymo dataset, our method called Multi-instance Siamese Network (MultiSiam)\nremarkably improves generalization ability and achieves state-of-the-art\ntransfer performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, including Cityscapes and\nBDD100K, while existing SSL counterparts like MoCo, MoCo-v2, and BYOL show\nsignificant performance drop.

Due to the cascading effect, cloud failures often come with an\noverwhelming number of incidents from dependent services and devices. To pursue\nefficient incident management, related incidents should be quickly aggregated\nto narrow down the problem scope. To this end, in this paper, we propose GRLIA,\nan incident aggregation framework based on graph representation learning over\nthe cascading graph of cloud failures. A representation vector is learned for\neach unique type of incident in an unsupervised and unified manner, which is\nable to simultaneously encode the topological and temporal correlations among\nincidents. Thus, it can be easily employed for online incident aggregation. In\nparticular, to learn the correlations more accurately, we try to recover the\ncomplete scope of failures' cascading impact by leveraging fine-grained system\nmonitoring data, i.e., Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The proposed\nframework is evaluated with real-world incident data collected from a\nlarge-scale online service system of Huawei Cloud.

Given the absence of\ntraining data, we used a query-focused summarisation system that was trained\nwith the BioASQ8b training data set and we experimented with methods to\nretrieve the documents and snippets. Considering the poor quality of the\ndocuments and snippets retrieved by our system, we observed reasonably good\nquality in the answers returned. For phase B of the BioASQ9b task, the relevant\ndocuments and snippets were already included in the test data. Our system split\nthe snippets into candidate sentences and used BERT variants under a sentence\nclassification setup. The system used the question and candidate sentence as\ninput and was trained to predict the likelihood of the candidate sentence being\npart of the ideal answer. The runs obtained either the best or second best\nROUGE-F1 results of all participants to all batches of BioASQ9b. This shows\nthat using BERT in a classification setup is a very strong baseline for the\nidentification of ideal answers.",

    "abstract": "Purpose. This study presents the results of an experiment we performed to\nmeasure the coverage of Digital Humanities (DH) publications in mainstream open\nand proprietary bibliographic data sources, by also highlighting the relation\nthat exists between DH and other disciplines.\nMethodology. We created a list of DH journals based on manual curation and\nbibliometric data. We used that list to identify DH publications in the\nconsidered bibliographic data sources. We used the ERIH-PLUS list of journals\nto identify Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) publications. We analysed the\ncitation links they included to understand the relationship between DH\npublications and SSH and non-SSH fields.\nFindings. Crossref was the database containing the highest number of DH\npublications. Citations from/to DH publications showed relations between DH and\nresearch in Computer Science, Linguistics, Psychology, and Pedagogical &\nEducational Research. Computer Science was responsible for a large part of\nincoming and outgoing citations to/from DH research, which suggests a\nreciprocal interest between the two disciplines.\nValue. This is the first large-scale study of DH research that involved a\nhuge number of bibliographic data sources, including open and proprietary\ndatabases.\nResearch limitations. The list of DH journals we created might not fully\nrepresent DH research published in journals. In addition, some DH publications\ncould have been cut off from the study, since we did not consider books and\nother publications published in proceedings of DH conferences and workshops.\nFinally, we used a specific time coverage (2000-2018) that could have prevented\nthe inclusion of additional DH publications.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has developed rapidly in the past few years and has\nsuccessfully been utilized for a broad range of tasks, including phishing\ndetection. However, building an effective ML-based detection system is not a\ntrivial task, and requires data scientists with knowledge of the relevant\ndomain. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks have received a lot of\nattention in recent years, enabling non-ML experts in building a machine\nlearning model. This brings to an intriguing question of whether AutoML can\noutperform the results achieved by human data scientists. Our paper compares\nthe performances of six well-known, state-of-the-art AutoML frameworks on ten\ndifferent phishing datasets to see whether AutoML-based models can outperform\nmanually crafted machine learning models. Our results indicate that\nAutoML-based models are able to outperform manually developed machine learning\nmodels in complex classification tasks, specifically in datasets where the\nfeatures are not quite discriminative, and datasets with overlapping classes or\nrelatively high degrees of non-linearity. Challenges also remain in building a\nreal-world phishing detection system using AutoML frameworks due to the current\nsupport only on supervised classification problems, leading to the need for\nlabeled data, and the inability to update the AutoML-based models\nincrementally. This indicates that experts with knowledge in the domain of\nphishing and cybersecurity are still essential in the loop of the phishing\ndetection pipeline.",

Predicting translation errors, i.e.\ndetecting specifically which words are incorrect, is a more challenging task,\nespecially with limited amounts of training data. We hypothesize that, not\nunlike humans, successful QE models rely on translation errors to predict\noverall sentence quality. By exploring a set of feature attribution methods\nthat assign relevance scores to the inputs to explain model predictions, we\nstudy the behaviour of state-of-the-art sentence-level QE models and show that\nexplanations (i.e. rationales) extracted from these models can indeed be used\nto detect translation errors.

We propose a\npartition filter network to model two-way interaction between tasks properly,\nwhere feature encoding is decomposed into two steps: partition and filter.

In this work, we provide a\ndetailed case study of the self-explaining network, ProtoPNet, in the presence\nof a spectrum of artifacts. Accordingly, we identify the main drawbacks of\nProtoPNet, especially, its coarse and spatially imprecise explanations. We\naddress these limitations by introducing Prototypical Relevance Propagation\n(PRP), a novel method for generating more precise model-aware explanations.\nFurthermore, in order to obtain a clean dataset, we propose to use multi-view\nclustering strategies for segregating the artifact images using the PRP\nexplanations, thereby suppressing the potential artifact learning in the\nmodels.",

For this, Enel incorporates descriptive\nproperties that capture the respective execution context, considers statistics\nfrom individual dataflow tasks, and propagates predictions through the job\ngraph to eventually find an optimized new scale-out.

Synchoricity discretises space with a virtual grid, the\nway synchronicity discretises time with clock ticks. SiLago (Silicon Lego)\nblocks are atomic synchoros building blocks like Lego bricks. SiLago blocks\nabsorb all metal layer details, i.e., all wires, to enable composition by\nabutment of valid; valid in the sense of being technology design rules\ncompliant, timing clean and OCV ruggedized. Effectively, composition by\nabutment eliminates logic and physical synthesis for the end user.

In this paper, we show, how with a small library of SiLago blocks\nfor global NoCs, it is possible to automatically synthesize arbitrary global\nNoCs of different types, dimensions, and topology. The synthesized global NoCs\nare not only valid VLSI designs, their cost metrics (area, latency, and energy)\nare known with post-layout accuracy in linear time. We argue that this is\nessential to be able to do chip-level design space exploration. We show how the\nabstract timing model of such global NoC SiLago blocks can be built and used to\nanalyse the timing of global NoC links with post layout accuracy and in linear\ntime.

This poses a substantial challenge for environment\nperception methods like object detection or tracking. Especially problematic\nare clutter detections that occur in groups or at similar locations in multiple\nconsecutive measurements. In this paper, a new algorithm for identifying such\nerroneous detections is presented. It is mainly based on the modeling of\nspecific commonly occurring wave propagation paths that lead to clutter. In\nparticular, the three effects explicitly covered are reflections at the\nunderbody of a car or truck, signals traveling back and forth between the\nvehicle on which the sensor is mounted and another object, and multipath\npropagation via specular reflection. The latter often occurs near guardrails,\nconcrete walls or similar reflective surfaces. Each of these effects is\ndescribed both theoretically and regarding a method for identifying the\ncorresponding clutter detections. Identification is done by analyzing\ndetections generated from a single sensor measurement only. The final algorithm\nis evaluated on recordings of real extra-urban traffic. For labeling, a\nsemi-automatic process is employed. The results are promising, both in terms of\nperformance and regarding the very low execution time.

The proposed method also serves as an effective strategy to compensate\nfor the lack of transcribed speech, effectively matching the performance of\n5000 hours of transcribed speech with just 100 hours of transcribed speech on\nthe AMI meeting transcription task. Finally, we demonstrate WER reductions of\nup to 15% on an in-house Voice Search task over traditional pretraining.\nIncorporating text into encoder pretraining is complimentary to rescoring with\na larger or in-domain language model, resulting in additional 6% relative\nreduction in WER.",

    "abstract": "The automatic generation of computer programs is one of the main applications\nwith practical relevance in the field of evolutionary computation. With program\nsynthesis techniques not only software developers could be supported in their\neveryday work but even users without any programming knowledge could be\nempowered to automate repetitive tasks and implement their own new\nfunctionality. In recent years, many novel program synthesis approaches based\non evolutionary algorithms have been proposed and evaluated on common benchmark\nproblems. Therefore, we identify in this work the relevant evolutionary program\nsynthesis approaches and provide an in-depth analysis of their performance. The\nmost influential approaches we identify are stack-based, grammar-guided, as\nwell as linear genetic programming. Further, we find that these approaches\nperform well on benchmark problems if there is a simple mapping from the given\ninput to the correct output. On problems where this mapping is complex, e.g.,\nif the problem consists of several sub-problems or requires iteration/recursion\nfor a correct solution, results tend to be worse. Consequently, for future\nwork, we encourage researchers not only to use a program's output for assessing\nthe quality of a solution but also the way towards a solution (e.g., correctly\nsolved sub-problems).",

    "abstract": "In the search for knowledge graph embeddings that could capture ontological\nknowledge, geometric models of existential rules have been recently introduced.\nIt has been shown that convex geometric regions capture the so-called\nquasi-chained rules. Attributed description logics (DL) have been defined to\nbridge the gap between DL languages and knowledge graphs, whose facts often\ncome with various kinds of annotations that may need to be taken into account\nfor reasoning. In particular, temporally attributed DLs are enriched by\nspecific attributes whose semantics allows for some temporal reasoning.\nConsidering that geometric models and (temporally) attributed DLs are promising\ntools designed for knowledge graphs, this paper investigates their\ncompatibility, focusing on the attributed version of a Horn dialect of the\nDL-Lite family. We first adapt the definition of geometric models to attributed\nDLs and show that every satisfiable ontology has a convex geometric model. Our\nsecond contribution is a study of the impact of temporal attributes.

    "abstract": "Thanks to their ability to learn data distributions without requiring paired\ndata, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become an integral part of\nmany computer vision methods, including those developed for medical image\nsegmentation. These methods jointly train a segmentor and an adversarial mask\ndiscriminator, which provides a data-driven shape prior. At inference, the\ndiscriminator is discarded, and only the segmentor is used to predict label\nmaps on test images. But should we discard the discriminator? Here, we argue\nthat the life cycle of adversarial discriminators should not end after\ntraining. On the contrary, training stable GANs produces powerful shape priors\nthat we can use to correct segmentor mistakes at inference. To achieve this, we\ndevelop stable mask discriminators that do not overfit or catastrophically\nforget. At test time, we fine-tune the segmentor on each individual test\ninstance until it satisfies the learned shape prior. Our method is simple to\nimplement and increases model performance. Moreover, it opens new directions\nfor re-using mask discriminators at inference. We release the code used for the\nexperiments at https://vios-s.github.io/adversarial-test-time-training.",

    "abstract": "Recently, many datasets have been proposed to test the systematic\ngeneralization ability of neural networks. The companion baseline Transformers,\ntypically trained with default hyper-parameters from standard tasks, are shown\nto fail dramatically. Here we demonstrate that by revisiting model\nconfigurations as basic as scaling of embeddings, early stopping, relative\npositional embedding, and Universal Transformer variants, we can drastically\nimprove the performance of Transformers on systematic generalization. We report\nimprovements on five popular datasets: SCAN, CFQ, PCFG, COGS, and Mathematics\ndataset. Our models improve accuracy from 50% to 85% on the PCFG productivity\nsplit, and from 35% to 81% on COGS. On SCAN, relative positional embedding\nlargely mitigates the EOS decision problem (Newman et al., 2020), yielding 100%\naccuracy on the length split with a cutoff at 26. Importantly, performance\ndifferences between these models are typically invisible on the IID data split.\nThis calls for proper generalization validation sets for developing neural\nnetworks that generalize systematically. We publicly release the code to\nreproduce our results.",

Although both types of learning have their place in an\neducational system it is important to be able to distinguish between these two\napproaches to learning and identify options which can dislodge students from\nrote learning and motivate them towards meaningful learning. The tutor-web is\nan online drilling system. The design aim of the system is learning rather than\nevaluation. This is done by presenting students with multiple-choice questions\nwhich are selected randomly but linked to the students' performance. The\nquestions themselves can be generated for a specific topic by drawing correct\nand incorrect answers from a collection associated with a general problem\nstatement or heading. With this generating process students may see the same\nquestion heading twice but be presented with all new answer options or a\nmixture of new and old answer options. Data from a course on probability theory\nand statistics, taught during COVID-19, are analysed to separate rote learning\nfrom meaningful learning. The analyses show non-rote learning, but even with\nlarge question databases, students' performance is better when they are\npresented with an answer option they have seen before. An element of rote\nlearning is thus exhibited but a deeper learning is also demonstrated. The item\ndatabase has been seeded with hints such that some questions contain clues to\ncue the students towards the correct answer. This ties in with the issue of\nmeaningful learning versus rote learning since the hope is that a new hint will\nwork as a cue to coax the student to think harder about the question rather\nthan continue to employ rote learning. Preliminary results indicate that hints\nare particularly useful for students with poor performance metrics.",

The MCSC decoder architecture consists of\nmultiple SC decoders with lower frequency and pipeline depth to process\nmultiple codewords in parallel to achieve lower power consumption.

    "abstract": "Transfer learning aims to learn classifiers for a target domain by\ntransferring knowledge from a source domain. However, due to two main issues:\nfeature discrepancy and distribution divergence, transfer learning can be a\nvery difficult problem in practice. In this paper, we present a framework\ncalled TLF that builds a classifier for the target domain having only few\nlabeled training records by transferring knowledge from the source domain\nhaving many labeled records. While existing methods often focus on one issue\nand leave the other one for the further work, TLF is capable of handling both\nissues simultaneously. In TLF, we alleviate feature discrepancy by identifying\nshared label distributions that act as the pivots to bridge the domains. We\nhandle distribution divergence by simultaneously optimizing the structural risk\nfunctional, joint distributions between domains, and the manifold consistency\nunderlying marginal distributions. Moreover, for the manifold consistency we\nexploit its intrinsic properties by identifying k nearest neighbors of a\nrecord, where the value of k is determined automatically in TLF. Furthermore,\nsince negative transfer is not desired, we consider only the source records\nthat are belonging to the source pivots during the knowledge transfer. We\nevaluate TLF on seven publicly available natural datasets and compare the\nperformance of TLF against the performance of eleven state-of-the-art\ntechniques.

With data collected from 31 subjects, we show\nthat EarGate achieves up to 97.26% Balanced Accuracy (BAC) with very low False\nAcceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 3.23% and 2.25%,\nrespectively. Further, our measurement of power consumption and latency\ninvestigates how this gait identification model could live both as a\nstand-alone or cloud-coupled earable system.",

Understanding the kinematics\nand kinetics of the lower limbs during continuously varying locomotion is\nfundamental to developing robotic prostheses and exoskeletons that assist in\ncommunity ambulation.

    "abstract": "Traffic accident prediction is a crucial task in the mobility domain.\nState-of-the-art accident prediction approaches are based on static and uniform\ngrid-based geospatial aggregations, limiting their capability for fine-grained\npredictions. This property becomes particularly problematic in more complex\nregions such as city centers. In such regions, a grid cell can contain\nsubregions with different properties; furthermore, an actual accident-prone\nregion can be split across grid cells arbitrarily. This paper proposes Adaptive\nClustering Accident Prediction (ACAP) - a novel accident prediction method\nbased on a grid growing algorithm. ACAP applies adaptive clustering to the\nobserved geospatial accident distribution and performs embeddings of temporal,\naccident-related, and regional features to increase prediction accuracy. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ACAP method using open real-world\naccident datasets from three cities in Germany. We demonstrate that ACAP\nimproves the accident prediction performance for complex regions by 2-3 percent\npoints in F1-score by adapting the geospatial aggregation to the distribution\nof the underlying spatio-temporal events. Our grid growing approach outperforms\nthe clustering-based baselines by four percent points in terms of F1-score on\naverage.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic computing (SC) is a low-cost computational paradigm that has\npromising applications in digital filter design, image processing and neural\nnetworks. Fundamental to these applications is the weighted addition operation\nwhich is most often implemented by a multiplexer (mux) tree. Mux-based adders\nhave very low area but typically require long bit-streams to reach practical\naccuracy thresholds when the number of summands is large. In this work, we\nfirst identify the main contributors to mux adder error. We then demonstrate\nwith analysis and experiment that two new techniques, precise sampling and full\ncorrelation, can target and mitigate these error sources. Implementing these\ntechniques in hardware leads to the design of CeMux (Correlation-enhanced\nMultiplexer), a stochastic mux adder that is significantly more accurate and\nuses much less area than traditional weighted adders. We compare CeMux to other\nSC and hybrid designs for an electrocardiogram filtering case study that\nemploys a large digital filter. One major result is that CeMux is shown to be\naccurate even for large input sizes. CeMux's higher accuracy leads to a latency\nreduction of 4x to 16x over other designs. Further, CeMux uses about 35% less\narea than existing designs, and we demonstrate that a small amount of accuracy\ncan be traded for a further 50% reduction in area. Finally, we compare CeMux to\na conventional binary design and we show that CeMux can achieve a 50 to 73%\narea reduction for similar power and latency as the conventional design, but at\na slightly higher level of error.",

    "abstract": "An approach to model and estimate human walking kinematics in real-time for\nPhysical Human-Robot Interaction is presented. The human gait velocity along\nthe forward and vertical direction of motion is modelled according to the\nYoyo-model. We designed an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm to estimate\nthe frequency, bias and trigonometric state of a biased sinusoidal signal, from\nwhich the kinematic parameters of the Yoyo-model can be extracted. Quality and\nrobustness of the estimation are improved by opportune filtering based on\nheuristics. The approach is successfully evaluated on a real dataset of walking\nhumans, including complex trajectories and changing step frequency over time.",

    "abstract": "Building energy performance is one of the key features in performance-based\nbuilding design decision making. Building envelope materials can play a key\nrole in improving building energy performance. The thermal properties of\nbuilding materials determine the level of heat transfer through building\nenvelope, thus the annual thermal energy performance of the building. This\nresearch applies the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) method to study the\neffects of materials' thermal properties on building thermal loads. Two\napproaches are adopted for feature selection including the Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) and the Exhaustive Feature Selection (EFS). A hypothetical\ndesign scenario is developed with six material alternatives for an office\nbuilding in Los Angeles, California. The best design alternative is selected\nbased on the LDA results and the key input parameters are determined based on\nthe PCA and EFS methods. The PCA results confirm that among all thermal\nproperties of the materials, the four parameters including thermal\nconductivity, density, specific heat capacity, and thickness are the most\ncritical features, in terms of building thermal behavior and thermal energy\nconsumption. This result matches quite well with the assumptions of most of the\nbuilding energy simulation tools.",

    "abstract": "Nakamoto's seminal work gave rise to permissionless blockchains -- as well as\na wide range of proposals to mitigate its performance shortcomings. Despite\nsubstantial throughput and energy efficiency achievements, most proposals only\nbring modest (or marginal) gains in transaction commit latency. Consequently,\ncommit latencies in today's permissionless blockchain landscape remain\nprohibitively high for latency-sensitive geo-distributed applications. This\npaper proposes NimbleChain, which extends standard permissionless blockchains\nwith a fast path that delivers consensusless promises of commitment. This fast\npath supports cryptocurrency transactions and only takes a small fraction of\nthe original commit latency, while providing consistency guarantees that are\nstrong enough to ensure correct cryptocurrencies. Since today's general-purpose\nblockchains also support smart contract transactions, which typically have\n(strong) sequential consistency needs, NimbleChain implements a hybrid\nconsistency model that also supports strongly-consistent applications. To the\nbest of our knowledge, NimbleChain is the first system to bring together fast\nconsensusless transactions with strongly-consistent consensus-based\ntransactions in a permissionless setting. We implement NimbleChain as an\nextension of Ethereum and evaluate it in a 500-node geo-distributed deployment.\nThe results show that the average latency to promise a transaction is an order\nof magnitude faster than consensus-based commit, with minimal overhead when\ncompared with a vanilla Ethereum implementation.",

Before solving a problem on D-Wave, several pre-processing\nmethods can be applied, one of them being the so-called spin reversal or gauge\ntransform. The spin reversal transform flips the sign of selected variables and\ncoefficients of the Ising or QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization)\nrepresentation of the problem that D-Wave minimizes. The spin reversal\ntransform leaves the ground state of the Ising model invariant, but can average\nout the biases induced through analog and systematic errors on the device, thus\nimproving the quality of the solution that D-Wave returns. This work\ninvestigates the effectiveness of the spin reversal transform for D-Wave 2000Q.\nWe consider two important NP-hard problems, the Maximum Clique and the Minimum\nVertex Cover problems, and show on a variety of input problem graphs that using\nthe spin reversal transform can yield substantial improvements in solution\nquality. In contrast to the native spin reversal built into D-Wave, we consider\nmore general ways to reverse individual spins and we investigate the dependence\non the problem type, on the spin reversal probability, and possible advantages\nof carrying out reversals on the qubit instead of the chain level.

It would be\nuseful to know what happens in the quantum processor during the anneal process\nso that one could design better algorithms or suggest improvements to the\nhardware. However, existing quantum annealers are not able to directly extract\nsuch information from the processor. Hence, in this work we propose to use\nadvanced features of D-Wave 2000Q to indirectly infer information about the\ndynamics of the state evolution during the anneal process. Specifically, D-Wave\n2000Q allows the user to customize the anneal schedule, that is, the schedule\nwith which the anneal fraction is changed from the start to the end of the\nanneal. Using this feature, we design a set of modified anneal schedules whose\noutputs can be used to generate information about the states of the system at\nuser-defined time points during a standard anneal. With this process, called\n\"slicing\", we obtain approximate distributions of lowest-energy anneal\nsolutions as the anneal time evolves. We use our technique to obtain a variety\nof insights into the annealer, such as the state evolution during annealing,\nwhen individual bits in an evolving solution flip during the anneal process and\nwhen they stabilize, and we introduce a technique to estimate the freeze-out\npoint of both the system as well as of individual qubits.",

However, this process is subject to\nmultiple sources of biases, including poor calibration, leakage between\nadjacent qubits, control biases, etc., which might negatively influence the\nquality of the annealing results. In this work, we aim at mitigating the effect\nof such biases for solving constrained optimization problems, by offering a\ntwo-step method, and apply it to Graph Partitioning. In the first step, we\nmeasure and reduce any biases that result from implementing the constraints of\nthe problem. In the second, we add the objective function to the resulting\nbias-corrected implementation of the constraints, and send the problem to the\nquantum annealer. We apply this concept to Graph Partitioning, an important\nNP-hard problem, which asks to find a partition of the vertices of a graph that\nis balanced (the constraint) and minimizes the cut size (the objective). We\nfirst quantify the bias of the implementation of the constraint on the quantum\nannealer, that is, we require, in an unbiased implementation, that any two\nvertices have the same likelihood of being assigned to the same or to different\nparts of the partition. We then propose an iterative method to correct any such\nbiases. We demonstrate that, after adding the objective, solving the resulting\nbias-corrected Ising problem on the quantum annealer results in a higher\nsolution accuracy.",

To this end, we run five fair sampling problems\n(each with at least three ground state solutions) that are based both on\nquantum annealing and on the Grover Mixer-QAOA algorithm for gate-based NISQ\nhardware.

Overall, our results show that NISQ devices do not achieve fair\nsampling yet.

In this\ncontribution, we explore the potential and effectiveness of such quantum\nannealers for computing Boolean tensor networks. Tensors offer a natural way to\nmodel high-dimensional data commonplace in many scientific fields, and\nrepresenting a binary tensor as a Boolean tensor network is the task of\nexpressing a tensor containing categorical (i.e., $\\{0, 1\\}$) values as a\nproduct of low dimensional binary tensors. A Boolean tensor network is computed\nby Boolean tensor decomposition, and it is usually not exact. The aim of such\ndecomposition is to minimize the given distance measure between the\nhigh-dimensional input tensor and the product of lower-dimensional (usually\nthree-dimensional) tensors and matrices representing the tensor network. In\nthis paper, we introduce and analyze three general algorithms for Boolean\ntensor networks: Tucker, Tensor Train, and Hierarchical Tucker networks. The\ncomputation of a Boolean tensor network is reduced to a sequence of Boolean\nmatrix factorizations, which we show can be expressed as a quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization problem suitable for solving on a quantum\nannealer.

    "abstract": "Background & Purpose: Chest X-Ray (CXR) use in pre-MRI safety screening for\nLead-Less Implanted Electronic Devices (LLIEDs), easily overlooked or\nmisidentified on a frontal view (often only acquired), is common. Although most\nLLIED types are \"MRI conditional\": 1. Some are stringently conditional; 2.\nDifferent conditional types have specific patient- or device- management\nrequirements; and 3. Particular types are \"MRI unsafe\". This work focused on\ndeveloping CXR interpretation-assisting Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nmethodology with: 1. 100% detection for LLIED presence/location; and 2. High\nclassification in LLIED typing. Materials & Methods: Data-mining\n(03/1993-02/2021) produced an AI Model Development Population (1,100\npatients/4,871 images) creating 4,924 LLIED Region-Of-Interests (ROIs) (with\nimage-quality grading) used in Training, Validation, and Testing.

Results: To achieve 100% LLIED\ndetection, probability threshold reduction to 0.00002 was required by Model 1,\nresulting in increasing GBBs per LLIED-related ROI. Targeting LLIED-type\nclassification following detection of all LLIEDs, Model 2 multi-classified to\nreach high-performance while decreasing falsely positive GBBs. Despite 24%\nsuboptimal ROI image quality, classification was correct in 98.9% and AUCs for\nthe 9 LLIED-types were 1.00 for 8 and 0.92 for 1. For all misclassification\ncases: 1. None involved stringently conditional or unsafe LLIEDs; and 2. Most\nwere attributable to suboptimal images. Conclusion: This project successfully\ndeveloped a LLIED-related AI methodology supporting: 1. 100% detection; and 2.\nTypically 100% type classification.",

For this family of LTI networks, not only is the\nzero/nonzero/arbitrary pattern of system matrices available, but also for a\ngiven \\Delta, there might be extra information about the intersection of the\nspectrum associated with some subsystems and \\Delta. Given a set \\Delta, we\nfirst define a \\Delta-network graph, and by introducing a coloring process of\nthis graph, we establish a correspondence between the set of control subsystems\nand the so-called zero forcing sets.

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks have made significant\nadvances in pathology image segmentation. However, pathology image segmentation\nencounters with a dilemma in which the higher-performance networks generally\nrequire more computational resources and storage. This phenomenon limits the\nemployment of high-accuracy networks in real scenes due to the inherent\nhigh-resolution of pathological images. To tackle this problem, we propose CoCo\nDistillNet, a novel Cross-layer Correlation (CoCo) knowledge distillation\nnetwork for pathological gastric cancer segmentation. Knowledge distillation, a\ngeneral technique which aims at improving the performance of a compact network\nthrough knowledge transfer from a cumbersome network. Concretely, our CoCo\nDistillNet models the correlations of channel-mixed spatial similarity between\ndifferent layers and then transfers this knowledge from a pre-trained\ncumbersome teacher network to a non-trained compact student network. In\naddition, we also utilize the adversarial learning strategy to further prompt\nthe distilling procedure which is called Adversarial Distillation (AD).\nFurthermore, to stabilize our training procedure, we make the use of the\nunsupervised Paraphraser Module (PM) to boost the knowledge paraphrase in the\nteacher network. As a result, extensive experiments conducted on the Gastric\nCancer Segmentation Dataset demonstrate the prominent ability of CoCo\nDistillNet which achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "Congestion pricing has received lots of attention in scientific discussion.\nCongestion pricing means that the operator increases prices at the time of\ncongestion and the traffic demand are expected to decrease. In a certain sense,\nshadow prices are an optimal way of congestion pricing: users are charged\nshadow prices, i.e., the expectations of future losses because of blocked\nconnections. The shadow prices can be calculated exactly from the Howard\nequation, but this method is difficult. The paper presents simple\napproximations to the solution of the Howard equation and a way to derive more\nexact approximations. If users do not react by lowering their demand, they will\nreceive higher bills to pay. Many users do not react to increased prices but\nwould want to know how the congestion pricing mechanism affects the bills. The\ndistribution of the price of a connection follows from knowing the shadow\nprices and the probability of a congestion state. There is another interesting\ndistribution. The network produces profit to the operator, or equivalently,\nblocked connections produce a cost to the operator. The average cost rate can\nbe calculated from the Howard equation, but the costs have some distribution.\nThe distribution gives the risk that the actual costs exceed the average costs,\nand the operator should include this risk in the prices. The main result of\nthis paper shows how to calculate the distribution of the costs in the future\nfor congestion pricing by shadow prices and for congestion pricing with a more\nsimple pricing scheme that produces the same average costs.",

EMF signals, rotor speed,\nelectromagnetic torque, Hall Effect signals, PWM and EMF signals simulations\nare then obtained.

First, the\nincremental model of the microgrid system with constant impedance, current, and\npower devices is shown to admit a port-Hamiltonian (pH) representation, and its\npassive output is determined.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel hierarchical coding scheme for light fields based\non transmittance patterns of low-rank multiplicative layers and Fourier\ndisparity layers. The proposed scheme identifies multiplicative layers of light\nfield view subsets optimized using a convolutional neural network for different\nscanning orders. Our approach exploits the hidden low-rank structure in the\nmultiplicative layers obtained from the subsets of different scanning patterns.\nThe spatial redundancies in the multiplicative layers can be efficiently\nremoved by performing low-rank approximation at different ranks on the Krylov\nsubspace. The intra-view and inter-view redundancies between approximated\nlayers are further removed by HEVC encoding. Next, a Fourier disparity layer\nrepresentation is constructed from the first subset of the approximated light\nfield based on the chosen hierarchical order. Subsequent view subsets are\nsynthesized by modeling the Fourier disparity layers that iteratively refine\nthe representation with improved accuracy. The critical advantage of the\nproposed hybrid layered representation and coding scheme is that it utilizes\nnot just spatial and temporal redundancies in light fields but efficiently\nexploits intrinsic similarities among neighboring sub-aperture images in both\nhorizontal and vertical directions as specified by different predication\norders. In addition, the scheme is flexible to realize a range of multiple\nbitrates at the decoder within a single integrated system.

This work introduces a deep-learning system named\nSynthIA (Synthetic Inversion Approximation), that can enhance both missions by\ncapturing the best of each instrument's characteristics. We use SynthIA to\nproduce a new magnetogram data product, SynodeP (Synthetic Hinode Pipeline),\nthat mimics magnetograms from the higher spectral resolution Hinode/SOT-SP\npipeline, but is derived from full-disk, high-cadence, and lower\nspectral-resolution SDO/HMI Stokes observations. Results on held-out data show\nthat SynodeP has good agreement with the Hinode/SOT-SP pipeline inversions,\nincluding magnetic fill fraction, which is not provided by the current SDO/HMI\npipeline. SynodeP further shows a reduction in the magnitude of the 24-hour\noscillations present in the SDO/HMI data. To demonstrate SynthIA's generality,\nwe show the use of SDO/AIA data and subsets of the HMI data as inputs, which\nenables trade-offs between fidelity to the Hinode/SOT-SP inversions, number of\nobservations used, and temporal artifacts.
