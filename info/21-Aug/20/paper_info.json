    "abstract": "Coronary heart disease (CAD) is one of the crucial reasons for cardiovascular\nmortality in middle-aged people worldwide. The most typical tool is angiography\nfor diagnosing CAD. The challenges of CAD diagnosis using angiography are\ncostly and have side effects. One of the alternative solutions is the use of\nmachine learning-based patterns for CAD diagnosis. Hence, this paper provides a\nnew hybrid machine learning model called Genetic Support Vector Machine and\nAnalysis of Variance (GSVMA). The ANOVA is known as the kernel function for\nSVM. The proposed model is performed based on the Z-Alizadeh Sani dataset. A\ngenetic optimization algorithm is used to select crucial features. In addition,\nSVM with Anova, Linear SVM, and LibSVM with radial basis function methods were\napplied to classify the dataset. As a result, the GSVMA hybrid method performs\nbetter than other methods. This proposed method has the highest accuracy of\n89.45% through a 10-fold cross-validation technique with 35 selected features\non the Z-Alizadeh Sani dataset. Therefore, the genetic optimization algorithm\nis very effective for improving accuracy. The computer-aided GSVMA method can\nbe helped clinicians with CAD diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Design space exploration is an important but costly step involved in the\ndesign/deployment of custom architectures to squeeze out maximum possible\nperformance and energy efficiency. Conventionally, optimizations require\niterative sampling of the design space using simulation or heuristic tools. In\nthis paper we investigate the possibility of learning the optimization task\nusing machine learning and hence using the learnt model to predict optimal\nparameters for the design and mapping space of custom architectures, bypassing\nany exploration step. We use three case studies involving the optimal array\ndesign, SRAM buffer sizing, mapping, and schedule determination for\nsystolic-array-based custom architecture design and mapping space. Within the\npurview of these case studies, we show that it is possible to capture the\ndesign space and train a model to \"generalize\" prediction the optimal design\nand mapping parameters when queried with workload and design constraints. We\nperform systematic design-aware and statistical analysis of the optimization\nspace for our case studies and highlight the patterns in the design space. We\nformulate the architecture design and mapping as a machine learning problem\nthat allows us to leverage existing ML models for training and inference. We\ndesign and train a custom network architecture called AIRCHITECT, which is\ncapable of learning the architecture design space with as high as 94.3% test\naccuracy and predicting optimal configurations which achieve on average\n(GeoMean) of 99.9% the best possible performance on a test dataset with $10^5$\nGEMM workloads.",

To deal with these\ndeficiencies, we design a novel node-to-node Contrastive learning framework for\nMulti-view network Embedding (CREME), which mainly contains two contrastive\nobjectives: Multi-view fusion InfoMax and Inter-view InfoMin. The former\nobjective distills information from embeddings generated from different graph\nviews, while the latter distinguishes different graph views better to capture\nthe complementary information between them. Specifically, we first apply a view\nencoder to generate each graph view representation and utilize a multi-view\naggregator to fuse these representations. Then, we unify the two contrastive\nobjectives into one learning objective for training. Extensive experiments on\nthree real-world datasets show that CREME outperforms existing methods\nconsistently.",

However, multi-hop reasoning is\ninapplicable for answering n-ary fact questions due to its linear reasoning\nnature. We discover that there are two feasible improvements: 1) upgrade the\nbasic reasoning unit from entity or relation to fact; and 2) upgrade the\nreasoning structure from chain to tree. Based on these, we propose a novel\nfact-tree reasoning framework, through transforming the question into a fact\ntree and performing iterative fact reasoning on it to predict the correct\nanswer. Through a comprehensive evaluation on the n-ary fact KGQA dataset\nintroduced by this work, we demonstrate that the proposed fact-tree reasoning\nframework has the desired advantage of high answer prediction accuracy. In\naddition, we also evaluate the fact-tree reasoning framework on two binary KGQA\ndatasets and show that our approach also has a strong reasoning ability\ncompared with several excellent baselines.

    "abstract": "Illicit drug trafficking via social media sites such as Instagram has become\na severe problem, thus drawing a great deal of attention from law enforcement\nand public health agencies. How to identify illicit drug dealers from social\nmedia data has remained a technical challenge due to the following reasons. On\nthe one hand, the available data are limited because of privacy concerns with\ncrawling social media sites; on the other hand, the diversity of drug dealing\npatterns makes it difficult to reliably distinguish drug dealers from common\ndrug users. Unlike existing methods that focus on posting-based detection, we\npropose to tackle the problem of illicit drug dealer identification by\nconstructing a large-scale multimodal dataset named Identifying Drug Dealers on\nInstagram (IDDIG). Totally nearly 4,000 user accounts, of which over 1,400 are\ndrug dealers, have been collected from Instagram with multiple data sources\nincluding post comments, post images, homepage bio, and homepage images. We\nthen design a quadruple-based multimodal fusion method to combine the multiple\ndata sources associated with each user account for drug dealer identification.\nExperimental results on the constructed IDDIG dataset demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method in identifying drug dealers (almost 95%\naccuracy). Moreover, we have developed a hashtag-based community detection\ntechnique for discovering evolving patterns, especially those related to\ngeography and drug types.",

This paper addresses the problem via outdoor\ncellular traffic distilled from over two billion records per day in a telecom\ncompany, because outdoor cellular traffic induced by user mobility is highly\nrelated to transportation traffic. We study road intersections in urban and aim\nto predict future outdoor cellular traffic of all intersections given historic\noutdoor cellular traffic. Furthermore, We propose a new model for multivariate\nspatial-temporal prediction, mainly consisting of two extending graph attention\nnetworks (GAT).

It is demonstrated, through computer\nemulation, that the proposed model can capture almost all spatially\nnon-stationary fading behaviors of the ELAA-mMIMO channel. Moreover, it has a\nlow implementational complexity. With the proposed channel model, Monte-Carlo\nsimulations are carried out to evaluate the channel capacity of ELAA-mMIMO. It\nis shown that the ELAA-mMIMO channel capacity has considerably different\nstochastic characteristics from the conventional mMIMO due to the presence of\nchannel spatial non-stationarity.",

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be effective at leveraging\nlarge-scale unlabeled data to mitigate the dependency on labeled data in order\nto learn better models for visual recognition and classification tasks.\nHowever, recent SSL methods rely on unlabeled image data at a scale of billions\nto work well. This becomes infeasible for tasks with relatively fewer unlabeled\ndata in terms of runtime, memory and data acquisition. To address this issue,\nwe propose noisy semi-supervised transfer learning, an efficient SSL approach\nthat integrates transfer learning and self-training with noisy student into a\nsingle framework, which is tailored for tasks that can leverage unlabeled image\ndata on a scale of thousands. We evaluate our method on both binary and\nmulti-class classification tasks, where the objective is to identify whether an\nimage displays people practicing sports or the type of sport, as well as to\nidentify the pose from a pool of popular yoga poses. Extensive experiments and\nablation studies demonstrate that by leveraging unlabeled data, our proposed\nframework significantly improves visual classification, especially in\nmulti-class classification settings compared to state-of-the-art methods.\nMoreover, incorporating transfer learning not only improves classification\nperformance, but also requires 6x less compute time and 5x less memory.

Our framework, named SO-Pose, takes a single RGB\nimage as input and respectively generates 2D-3D correspondences as well as\nself-occlusion information harnessing a shared encoder and two separate\ndecoders. Both outputs are then fused to directly regress the 6DoF pose\nparameters.

A recent line of research explores the power of graph\nneural networks to solve combinatorial and graph algorithmic problems such as\nsubgraph isomorphism, detecting cliques, and the traveling salesman problem.\nHowever, many NP-complete problems are as of yet unexplored using this method.\nIn this paper, we tackle the Steiner Tree Problem. We employ four learning\nframeworks to compute low cost Steiner trees: feed-forward neural networks,\ngraph neural networks, graph convolutional networks, and a graph attention\nmodel. We use these frameworks in two fundamentally different ways: 1) to train\nthe models to learn the actual Steiner tree nodes, 2) to train the model to\nlearn good Steiner point candidates to be connected to the constructed tree\nusing a shortest path in a greedy fashion. We illustrate the robustness of our\nheuristics on several random graph generation models as well as the SteinLib\ndata library. Our finding suggests that the out-of-the-box application of GNN\nmethods does worse than the classic 2-approximation method. However, when\ncombined with a greedy shortest path construction, it even does slightly better\nthan the 2-approximation algorithm.

First we establish a new baseline for sentiment analysis\non Twitch data, outperforming the previous supervised benchmark by 7.9% points.\nSecondly, we introduce a simple but powerful unsupervised framework based on\nword embeddings and k-NN to enrich existing models with out-of-vocabulary\nknowledge. This framework allows us to auto-generate a pseudo-dictionary of\nemotes and we show that we can nearly match the supervised benchmark above even\nwhen injecting such emote knowledge into sentiment classifiers trained on\nextraneous datasets such as movie reviews or Twitter.",

To this aim, we resort to the Willems'\nfundamental lemma and we derive the explicit formulas by suitably elaborating\nthe constrained optimization problem under investigation. The resulting optimal\ncontroller turns out to be a piecewise affine system coinciding with the\nsolution of the original model-based problem in case of noiseless data. Such an\nequivalence is proven to hold asymptotically also in presence of measurement\nnoise, thus making the proposed method a computationally efficient (but\nmodel-free) alternative to the state of the art predictive controls.

    "abstract": "Recent progress in stochastic motion prediction, i.e., predicting multiple\npossible future human motions given a single past pose sequence, has led to\nproducing truly diverse future motions and even providing control over the\nmotion of some body parts. However, to achieve this, the state-of-the-art\nmethod requires learning several mappings for diversity and a dedicated model\nfor controllable motion prediction. In this paper, we introduce a unified deep\ngenerative network for both diverse and controllable motion prediction. To this\nend, we leverage the intuition that realistic human motions consist of smooth\nsequences of valid poses, and that, given limited data, learning a pose prior\nis much more tractable than a motion one. We therefore design a generator that\npredicts the motion of different body parts sequentially, and introduce a\nnormalizing flow based pose prior, together with a joint angle loss, to achieve\nmotion realism.Our experiments on two standard benchmark datasets, Human3.6M\nand HumanEva-I, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art\nbaselines in terms of both sample diversity and accuracy.

In this paper, we develop the PEARL PLUS\n(PEARL$^+$) algorithm, which optimizes the policy for both prior safety and\nposterior adaptation.

Here, we present a printable\nself-sustained compliant oscillator that generates periodic actuation using\nonly constant electrical power, without discrete components or electronic\ncontrol hardware. This oscillator is robust (9 out of 10 prototypes worked\nsuccessfully on the first try), configurable (with tunable periods from 3 s to\n12 s), powerful (can overcome hydrodynamic resistance to consistently propel a\nswimmer at ~1.6 body lengths/min), and long-lasting (~10^3 cycles); it enables\ndriving macroscale devices with prescribed autonomous behaviors, e.g.\nlocomotion and sequencing. This oscillator is also fully functional underwater\nand in high magnetic fields. Our analytical model characterizes essential\nparameters of the oscillation period, enabling programmable design of the\noscillator. The printable oscillator can be integrated into origami-inspired\nsystems seamlessly and monolithically, allowing rapid design and prototyping;\nthe resulting integrated devices are lightweight, low-cost, compliant,\nelectronic-free, and nonmagnetic, enabling practical applications in extreme\nareas.

Due to the expensive cost of obtaining the labeled data, SLU\nsuffers from the data scarcity problem. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on\ndata augmentation for slot filling task in SLU. To achieve that, we aim at\ngenerating more diverse data based on existing data. Specifically, we try to\nexploit the latent language knowledge from pretrained language models by\nfinetuning them. We propose two strategies for finetuning process: value-based\nand context-based augmentation.

To extract richer information\nfrom the input graph, we proposed a multi-channel graph classification model\n(MCGC) with multiple feature extraction channels for GNN.

The motivation of Svar is to design an efficient,\nlight-weighted and general middle-ware for multiple languages, meanwhile,\nbrings the dynamism features from script language to C++ in a straightforward\nway. Firstly, a Svar class with JSON like data structure is designed to hold\neverything exists in C++, including basic values, functions or user defined\nclasses and objects. Secondly, arguments are auto cast to and from Svar\nefficiently with compile time pointers, references and shared\\_ptr detection.\nThirdly, classes and functions are binded with string names to support\nreflection, this means all functions and classes in a shared library can be\nexported to a Svar object, which also calls a Svar module. The Svar modules can\nbe accessed by different languages and this paper demonstrates how to import\nand use a Svar module in Python and Node.js. Moreover, the Svar modules or even\na python module can also be imported by C++ at runtime, which makes C++ easier\nto compile and use since headers are not required anymore. We compare the\nperformance of Svar with two state-of-the-art binding tool for Python and\nNode.js, and the result demonstrates that Svar is efficient, elegant and\ngeneral.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of query attribute value extraction, which aims to\nidentify named entities from user queries as diverse surface form attribute\nvalues and afterward transform them into formally canonical forms. Such a\nproblem consists of two phases: {named entity recognition (NER)} and {attribute\nvalue normalization (AVN)}. However, existing works only focus on the NER phase\nbut neglect equally important AVN. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a\nunified query attribute value extraction system in e-commerce search named\nQUEACO, which involves both two phases. Moreover, by leveraging large-scale\nweakly-labeled behavior data, we further improve the extraction performance\nwith less supervision cost. Specifically, for the NER phase, QUEACO adopts a\nnovel teacher-student network, where a teacher network that is trained on the\nstrongly-labeled data generates pseudo-labels to refine the weakly-labeled data\nfor training a student network. Meanwhile, the teacher network can be\ndynamically adapted by the feedback of the student's performance on\nstrongly-labeled data to maximally denoise the noisy supervisions from the weak\nlabels. For the AVN phase, we also leverage the weakly-labeled\nquery-to-attribute behavior data to normalize surface form attribute values\nfrom queries into canonical forms from products. Extensive experiments on a\nreal-world large-scale E-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of\nQUEACO.",

This control of access is important as there is now a need\nfor collaborative resource sharing between multiple organizations over open\nenvironments like the internet. Although there are multiple access control\nmodels that are being widely used, these models are providing access control\nwithin a closed environment i.e. within the organization using it. These models\nhave restricted capabilities in providing access control in open environments.\nAttribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) has emerged as a powerful access control\nmodel to bring fine-grained authorization to organizations that possess\nsensitive data and resources and want to collaborate over open environments. In\nan ABAC system, access to resources that an organization possess can be\ncontrolled by applying policies on attributes of the users. These policies are\nconditions that need to be satisfied by the requester in order to gain access\nto the resource. In this paper, we provide an introduction to ABAC and by\ncarrying forward the architecture of ABAC, we propose a Decentralized Policy\nInformation Point (PIP) model. Our model proposes the decentralization of PIP,\nwhich is an entity of the ABAC model that allows the storage and query of user\nattributes and enforces fine-grained access control for controlling the access\nof sensitive resources over multiple domains. Our model makes use of the\nconcept of a cryptographic primitive called Attribute-Based Signature (ABS) to\nkeep the identities of the users involved, private. Our model can be used for\ncollaborative resource sharing over the internet. The evaluation of our model\nis also discussed to reflect the application of the proposed decentralized PIP\nmodel.",

Researchers in\nthe field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) have concentrated on creating\ntools and strategies to identify, categorize, and sanitize private information\nin text data since a substantial amount of data is exchanged in textual form.\nHowever, most of the detection methods solely rely on the existence of\npre-identified keywords in the text and disregard the inference of the\nunderlying meaning of the utterance in a specific context. Hence, in some\nsituations, these tools and algorithms fail to detect disclosure, or the\nproduced results are miss-classified. In this paper, we propose a multi-input,\nmulti-output hybrid neural network which utilizes transfer-learning,\nlinguistics, and metadata to learn the hidden patterns. Our goal is to better\nclassify disclosure/non-disclosure content in terms of the context of\nsituation. We trained and evaluated our model on a human-annotated ground truth\ndataset, containing a total of 5,400 tweets. The results show that the proposed\nmodel was able to identify privacy disclosure through tweets with an accuracy\nof 77.4% while classifying the information type of those tweets with an\nimpressive accuracy of 99%, by jointly learning for two separate tasks.",

    "abstract": "Although automated metrics are commonly used to evaluate NLG systems, they\noften correlate poorly with human judgements. Newer metrics such as BERTScore\nhave addressed many weaknesses in prior metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE, which\nrely on n-gram matching. These newer methods, however, are still limited in\nthat they do not consider the generation context, so they cannot properly\nreward generated text that is correct but deviates from the given reference.\nIn this paper, we propose Language Model Augmented Relevance Score (MARS), a\nnew context-aware metric for NLG evaluation. MARS leverages off-the-shelf\nlanguage models, guided by reinforcement learning, to create augmented\nreferences that consider both the generation context and available human\nreferences, which are then used as additional references to score generated\ntext. Compared with seven existing metrics in three common NLG tasks, MARS not\nonly achieves higher correlation with human reference judgements, but also\ndifferentiates well-formed candidates from adversarial samples to a larger\ndegree.",

    "abstract": "Caching prefetches some library content at users' memories during the\noff-peak times (i.e., {\\it placement phase}), such that the number of\ntransmissions during the peak-traffic times (i.e., {\\it delivery phase}) are\nreduced. A coded caching strategy was originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and\nNiesen (MN) leading to a multicasting gain compared to the conventional uncoded\ncaching, where each message in the delivery phase is useful to multiple users\nsimultaneously. However, the MN coded caching scheme suffers from the high\nsubpacketization which makes it impractical. In order to reduce the\nsubpacketization while retain the multicast opportunities in the delivery\nphase, Yan et al. proposed a combinatorial structure called placement delivery\narray (PDA) to design coded caching schemes. In this paper, we propose two\nnovel frameworks for constructing PDA via Cartesian product, which constructs a\nPDA for $mK_1$ users by the $m$-fold Cartesian product of a PDA for $K_1$\nusers. By applying the proposed frameworks to some existing PDAs, three novel\ncaching schemes are obtained which can significantly reduce the\nsubpacketization of the MN scheme while slightly increasing the needed number\nof transmissions. For instance, for the third scheme which works for any number\nof users and any memory regime, while reducing the coded caching gain by one,\nthe needed subpacketization is at most\n$O\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{q}}2^{-\\frac{K}{q}}\\right)$ of that of the MN scheme,\nwhere $K$ is the number of users, $0<z/q<1$ is the memory ratio of each user,\nand $q,z$ are coprime.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the generalization behavior of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\nis gradually transparent through explanation techniques with the frequency\ncomponents decomposition. However, the importance of the phase spectrum of the\nimage for a robust vision system is still ignored. In this paper, we notice\nthat the CNN tends to converge at the local optimum which is closely related to\nthe high-frequency components of the training images, while the amplitude\nspectrum is easily disturbed such as noises or common corruptions. In contrast,\nmore empirical studies found that humans rely on more phase components to\nachieve robust recognition. This observation leads to more explanations of the\nCNN's generalization behaviors in both robustness to common perturbations and\nout-of-distribution detection, and motivates a new perspective on data\naugmentation designed by re-combing the phase spectrum of the current image and\nthe amplitude spectrum of the distracter image. That is, the generated samples\nforce the CNN to pay more attention to the structured information from phase\ncomponents and keep robust to the variation of the amplitude. Experiments on\nseveral image datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performances on multiple generalizations and calibration\ntasks, including adaptability for common corruptions and surface variations,\nout-of-distribution detection, and adversarial attack.",

    "abstract": "Though inverse approach is computationally efficient in aerodynamic design as\nthe desired target performance distribution is specified, it has some\nsignificant limitations that prevent full efficiency from being achieved.\nFirst, the iterative procedure should be repeated whenever the specified target\ndistribution changes. Target distribution optimization can be performed to\nclarify the ambiguity in specifying this distribution, but several additional\nproblems arise in this process such as loss of the representation capacity due\nto parameterization of the distribution, excessive constraints for a realistic\ndistribution, inaccuracy of quantities of interest due to theoretical/empirical\npredictions, and the impossibility of explicitly imposing geometric\nconstraints. To deal with these issues, a novel inverse design optimization\nframework with a two-step deep learning approach is proposed. A variational\nautoencoder and multi-layer perceptron are used to generate a realistic target\ndistribution and predict the quantities of interest and shape parameters from\nthe generated distribution, respectively. Then, target distribution\noptimization is performed as the inverse design optimization. The proposed\nframework applies active learning and transfer learning techniques to improve\naccuracy and efficiency. Finally, the framework is validated through\naerodynamic shape optimizations of the airfoil of a wind turbine blade, where\ninverse design is actively being applied. The results of the optimizations show\nthat this framework is sufficiently accurate, efficient, and flexible to be\napplied to other inverse design engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary hemorrhage (P-Hem) occurs among multiple species and can have\nvarious causes. Cytology of bronchoalveolarlavage fluid (BALF) using a 5-tier\nscoring system of alveolar macrophages based on their hemosiderin content is\nconsidered the most sensitive diagnostic method. We introduce a novel, fully\nannotated multi-species P-Hem dataset which consists of 74 cytology whole slide\nimages (WSIs) with equine, feline and human samples. To create this\nhigh-quality and high-quantity dataset, we developed an annotation pipeline\ncombining human expertise with deep learning and data visualisation techniques.\nWe applied a deep learning-based object detection approach trained on 17\nexpertly annotated equine WSIs, to the remaining 39 equine, 12 human and 7\nfeline WSIs. The resulting annotations were semi-automatically screened for\nerrors on multiple types of specialised annotation maps and finally reviewed by\na trained pathologists. Our dataset contains a total of 297,383\nhemosiderophages classified into five grades. It is one of the largest publicly\navailableWSIs datasets with respect to the number of annotations, the scanned\narea and the number of species covered.",

    "title": "An Information Theory-inspired Strategy for Automatic Network Pruning",
    "abstract": "Despite superior performance on many computer vision tasks, deep convolution\nneural networks are well known to be compressed on devices that have resource\nconstraints. Most existing network pruning methods require laborious human\nefforts and prohibitive computation resources, especially when the constraints\nare changed. This practically limits the application of model compression when\nthe model needs to be deployed on a wide range of devices. Besides, existing\nmethods are still challenged by the missing theoretical guidance. In this paper\nwe propose an information theory-inspired strategy for automatic model\ncompression. The principle behind our method is the information bottleneck\ntheory, i.e., the hidden representation should compress information with each\nother. We thus introduce the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion\n(nHSIC) on network activations as a stable and generalized indicator of layer\nimportance. When a certain resource constraint is given, we integrate the HSIC\nindicator with the constraint to transform the architecture search problem into\na linear programming problem with quadratic constraints. Such a problem is\neasily solved by a convex optimization method with a few seconds. We also\nprovide a rigorous proof to reveal that optimizing the normalized HSIC\nsimultaneously minimizes the mutual information between different layers.\nWithout any search process, our method achieves better compression tradeoffs\ncomparing to the state-of-the-art compression algorithms. For instance, with\nResNet-50, we achieve a 45.3%-FLOPs reduction, with a 75.75 top-1 accuracy on\nImageNet. Codes are avaliable at\nhttps://github.com/MAC-AutoML/ITPruner/tree/master.",

    "abstract": "In counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR) user interactions are used as a\nsource of supervision. Since user interactions come with bias, an important\nfocus of research in this field lies in developing methods to correct for the\nbias of interactions. Inverse propensity scoring (IPS) is a popular method\nsuitable for correcting position bias. Affine correction (AC) is a\ngeneralization of IPS that corrects for position bias and trust bias. IPS and\nAC provably remove bias, conditioned on an accurate estimation of the bias\nparameters. Estimating the bias parameters, in turn, requires an accurate\nestimation of the relevance probabilities. This cyclic dependency introduces\npractical limitations in terms of sensitivity, convergence and efficiency.\nWe propose a new correction method for position and trust bias in CLTR in\nwhich, unlike the existing methods, the correction does not rely on relevance\nestimation. Our proposed method, mixture-based correction (MBC), is based on\nthe assumption that the distribution of the CTRs over the items being ranked is\na mixture of two distributions: the distribution of CTRs for relevant items and\nthe distribution of CTRs for non-relevant items. We prove that our method is\nunbiased. The validity of our proof is not conditioned on accurate bias\nparameter estimation. Our experiments show that MBC, when used in different\nbias settings and accompanied by different LTR algorithms, outperforms AC, the\nstate-of-the-art method for correcting position and trust bias, in some\nsettings, while performing on par in other settings. Furthermore, MBC is orders\nof magnitude more efficient than AC in terms of the training time.",

One way to make the\nstep towards resilient high-performance systems that can deal with huge\nworkloads, is by enabling independent fault-tolerant clusters to efficiently\ncommunicate and cooperate with each other, as this also enables the usage of\nhigh-performance techniques such as sharding and parallel processing. Recently,\nsuch inter-cluster communication was formalized as the Byzantine\ncluster-sending problem, and worst-case optimal protocols have been proposed\nthat solve this problem. Unfortunately, these protocols have an all-case linear\ncomplexity in the size of the clusters involved.\nIn this paper, we propose probabilistic cluster-sending techniques that can\nreliably send messages from one Byzantine fault-tolerant cluster to another\nwith only an expected constant message complexity, this independent of the size\nof the clusters involved. Depending on the robustness of the clusters involved,\nour techniques require only two-to-four message round-trips. Furthermore, our\nprotocols can support worst-case linear communication between clusters, which\nis optimal, and deal with asynchronous and unreliable communication.

The\nparameter values correspond to a parametrized system of reaction-diffusion\nequations that generate Turing patterns as steady state. The Gierer-Meinhardt\nmodel with four parameters is chosen as a case study.

This enables to compute physically plausible distances\nbetween patterns, to compute clusters of patterns and, above all, model\nparameter prediction: for small training sets, classical state-of-the-art\nmethods including operator-valued kernels outperform neural networks that are\napplied to raw pattern data, whereas for large training sets the latter are\nmore accurate.

Deep learning methods often\nrely on either scale-invariant, translation-invariant, or rotation-invariant\noperations, such as max-pooling.

One approach to control the size of neural networks is\nretrospectively reducing the number of parameters, so-called neural network\npruning.

We close this gap by evaluating the\nrobustness of pruned models against L-0, L-2 and L-infinity attacks for a wide\nrange of attack strengths, several architectures, data sets, pruning methods,\nand compression rates. Our results confirm that neural network pruning and\nadversarial robustness are not mutually exclusive.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has achieved impressive\nperformance on outdoor datasets. Its performance however degrades notably in\nindoor environments because of the lack of textures. Without rich textures, the\nphotometric consistency is too weak to train a good depth network. Inspired by\nthe early works on indoor modeling, we leverage the structural regularities\nexhibited in indoor scenes, to train a better depth network. Specifically, we\nadopt two extra supervisory signals for self-supervised training: 1) the\nManhattan normal constraint and 2) the co-planar constraint. The Manhattan\nnormal constraint enforces the major surfaces (the floor, ceiling, and walls)\nto be aligned with dominant directions. The co-planar constraint states that\nthe 3D points be well fitted by a plane if they are located within the same\nplanar region. To generate the supervisory signals, we adopt two components to\nclassify the major surface normal into dominant directions and detect the\nplanar regions on the fly during training. As the predicted depth becomes more\naccurate after more training epochs, the supervisory signals also improve and\nin turn feedback to obtain a better depth model. Through extensive experiments\non indoor benchmark datasets, the results show that our network outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "The verification that planned security mechanisms are actually implemented in\nthe software code is a challenging endeavor. In the context of model-based\ndevelopment, the implemented security mechanisms must capture all intended\nsecurity properties that were considered in the design models. Assuring this\ncompliance manually is labor intensive and can be error-prone. This work\nintroduces the first semi-automatic technique for secure data flow compliance\nchecks between design models and code. We develop heuristic-based automated\nmappings between a design-level model (SecDFD, provided by humans) and a\ncode-level representation (Program Model, automatically extracted from the\nimplementation) in order to guide users in discovering compliance violations,\nand hence potential security flaws in the code. These mappings enable an\nautomated, and project-specific static analysis of the implementation with\nrespect to the desired security properties of the design model.\nWe contribute with (i) a definition of corresponding elements between the\ndesign-level and the implementation-level models and a heuristic-based approach\nto search for correspondences, (ii) two types of security compliance checks\nusing static code analysis, and (iii) an implementation of our approach as a\npublicly available Eclipse plugin, evaluated with three studies on open source\nJava projects. Our evaluation shows that the mappings are automatically\nsuggested with up to 87.2% precision. Further, the two developed types of\nsecurity compliance checks are relatively precise (average precision is 79.6%\nand 100%), but may still overlook some implemented information flows (average\nrecall is 65.5% and 94.5%) due to the large gap between the design and\nimplementation. Finally, our approach enables a project-specific analysis with\nup to 62% less false alarms raised by an existing data flow analyzer.",

In\ntoday's web PKI, all CAs are equally trusted, and security is defined by the\nweakest link. We address this problem by introducing trust flexibility in two\ndimensions: with F-PKI, each domain owner can define a domain policy\n(specifying, for example, which CAs are authorized to issue certificates for\ntheir domain name) and each client can set or choose a validation policy based\non trust levels. F-PKI thus supports a property that is sorely needed in\ntoday's Internet: trust heterogeneity. Different parties can express different\ntrust preferences while still being able to verify all certificates. In\ncontrast, today's web PKI only allows clients to fully distrust\nsuspicious/misbehaving CAs, which is likely to cause collateral damage in the\nform of legitimate certificates being rejected. Our contribution is to present\na system that is backward compatible, provides sensible security properties to\nboth clients and domain owners, ensures the verifiability of all certificates,\nand prevents downgrade attacks.

Our work is inspired by the state-of-the-art method DeepSDF\nthat learns and analyzes the 3D shape as the iso-surface of its shell and this\nmethod has shown promising results especially in the 3D shape reconstruction\nand compression domain. In this paper, we consider the degeneration problem of\nreconstruction coming from the capacity decrease of the DeepSDF model, which\napproximates the SDF with a neural network and a single latent code. We propose\nLocal Geometry Code Learning (LGCL), a model that improves the original DeepSDF\nresults by learning from a local shape geometry of the full 3D shape. We add an\nextra graph neural network to split the single transmittable latent code into a\nset of local latent codes distributed on the 3D shape. Mentioned latent codes\nare used to approximate the SDF in their local regions, which will alleviate\nthe complexity of the approximation compared to the original DeepSDF.\nFurthermore, we introduce a new geometric loss function to facilitate the\ntraining of these local latent codes. Note that other local shape adjusting\nmethods use the 3D voxel representation, which in turn is a problem highly\ndifficult to solve or even is insolvable. In contrast, our architecture is\nbased on graph processing implicitly and performs the learning regression\nprocess directly in the latent code space, thus make the proposed architecture\nmore flexible and also simple for realization. Our experiments on 3D shape\nreconstruction demonstrate that our LGCL method can keep more details with a\nsignificantly smaller size of the SDF decoder and outperforms considerably the\noriginal DeepSDF method under the most important quantitative metrics.",

Since the available source domains\nfor training are limited, recent approaches focus on generating samples of\nnovel domains.

To preserve class information during stylization, we first\ndecompose features into high and low frequency components. Afterward, we\nstylize the low frequency components with the novel domain styles sampled from\nthe manipulated statistics, while preserving the shape cues in high frequency\nones. As the final step, we re-merge both components to synthesize novel domain\nfeatures.

However, the very high-resolution\nsuperpixel segmentation still remains challenging due to the expensive memory\nand computation cost, making the current advanced superpixel networks fail to\nprocess. In this paper, we devise Patch Calibration Networks (PCNet), aiming to\nefficiently and accurately implement high-resolution superpixel segmentation.\nPCNet follows the principle of producing high-resolution output from\nlow-resolution input for saving GPU memory and relieving computation cost. To\nrecall the fine details destroyed by the down-sampling operation, we propose a\nnovel Decoupled Patch Calibration (DPC) branch for collaboratively augment the\nmain superpixel generation branch. In particular, DPC takes a local patch from\nthe high-resolution images and dynamically generates a binary mask to impose\nthe network to focus on region boundaries. By sharing the parameters of DPC and\nmain branches, the fine-detailed knowledge learned from high-resolution patches\nwill be transferred to help calibrate the destroyed information. To the best of\nour knowledge, we make the first attempt to consider the deep-learning-based\nsuperpixel generation for high-resolution cases.

    "abstract": "Given two strings $S$ and $P$, the Episode Matching problem is to compute the\nlength of the shortest substring of $S$ that contains $P$ as a subsequence. The\nbest known upper bound for this problem is $\\tilde O(nm)$ by Das et al. (1997),\nwhere $n,m$ are the lengths of $S$ and $P$, respectively. Although the problem\nis well studied and has many applications in data mining, this bound has never\nbeen improved. In this paper we show why this is the case by proving that an\n$O((nm)^{1-\\epsilon})$ algorithm (even for binary strings) would refute the\npopular Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). The proof is based on a\nsimple reduction from Orthogonal Vectors.",

    "abstract": "Question answering over knowledge graphs and other RDF data has been greatly\nadvanced, with a number of good systems providing crisp answers for natural\nlanguage questions or telegraphic queries. Some of these systems incorporate\ntextual sources as additional evidence for the answering process, but cannot\ncompute answers that are present in text alone. Conversely, systems from the IR\nand NLP communities have addressed QA over text, but barely utilize semantic\ndata and knowledge. This paper presents the first QA system that can seamlessly\noperate over RDF datasets and text corpora, or both together, in a unified\nframework. Our method, called UNIQORN, builds a context graph on the fly, by\nretrieving question-relevant triples from the RDF data and/or the text corpus,\nwhere the latter case is handled by automatic information extraction. The\nresulting graph is typically rich but highly noisy. UNIQORN copes with this\ninput by advanced graph algorithms for Group Steiner Trees, that identify the\nbest answer candidates in the context graph. Experimental results on several\nbenchmarks of complex questions with multiple entities and relations, show that\nUNIQORN, an unsupervised method with only five parameters, produces results\ncomparable to the state-of-the-art on KGs, text corpora, and heterogeneous\nsources. The graph-based methodology provides user-interpretable evidence for\nthe complete answering process.",

    "abstract": "We present a general learning-based solution for restoring images suffering\nfrom spatially-varying degradations. Prior approaches are typically\ndegradation-specific and employ the same processing across different images and\ndifferent pixels within. However, we hypothesize that such spatially rigid\nprocessing is suboptimal for simultaneously restoring the degraded pixels as\nwell as reconstructing the clean regions of the image. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose SPAIR, a network design that harnesses\ndistortion-localization information and dynamically adjusts computation to\ndifficult regions in the image. SPAIR comprises of two components, (1) a\nlocalization network that identifies degraded pixels, and (2) a restoration\nnetwork that exploits knowledge from the localization network in filter and\nfeature domain to selectively and adaptively restore degraded pixels. Our key\nidea is to exploit the non-uniformity of heavy degradations in spatial-domain\nand suitably embed this knowledge within distortion-guided modules performing\nsparse normalization, feature extraction and attention. Our architecture is\nagnostic to physical formation model and generalizes across several types of\nspatially-varying degradations. We demonstrate the efficacy of SPAIR\nindividually on four restoration tasks-removal of rain-streaks, raindrops,\nshadows and motion blur. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons\nwith prior art on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our\ndegradation-agnostic network design offers significant performance gains over\nstate-of-the-art degradation-specific architectures.

    "abstract": "To reconstruct a 3D scene from a set of calibrated views, traditional\nmulti-view stereo techniques rely on two distinct stages: local depth maps\ncomputation and global depth maps fusion. Recent studies concentrate on deep\nneural architectures for depth estimation by using conventional depth fusion\nmethod or direct 3D reconstruction network by regressing Truncated Signed\nDistance Function (TSDF). In this paper, we advocate that replicating the\ntraditional two stages framework with deep neural networks improves both the\ninterpretability and the accuracy of the results. As mentioned, our network\noperates in two steps: 1) the local computation of the local depth maps with a\ndeep MVS technique, and, 2) the depth maps and images' features fusion to build\na single TSDF volume. In order to improve the matching performance between\nimages acquired from very different viewpoints (e.g., large-baseline and\nrotations), we introduce a rotation-invariant 3D convolution kernel called\nPosedConv. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is underlined via a\nlarge series of experiments conducted on the ScanNet dataset where our approach\ncompares favorably against both traditional and deep learning techniques.",

    "abstract": "An adaptive traffic signal controller (ATSC) combined with a connected\nvehicle (CV) concept uses real-time vehicle trajectory data to regulate green\ntime and has the ability to reduce intersection waiting time significantly and\nthereby improve travel time in a signalized corridor. However, the CV-based\nATSC increases the size of the surface vulnerable to potential cyber-attack,\nallowing an attacker to generate disastrous traffic congestion in a roadway\nnetwork. An attacker can congest a route by generating fake vehicles by\nmaintaining traffic and car-following rules at a slow rate so that the signal\ntiming and phase change without having any abrupt changes in number of\nvehicles. Because of the adaptive nature of ATSC, it is a challenge to model\nthis kind of attack and also to develop a strategy for detection. This paper\nintroduces an innovative \"slow poisoning\" cyberattack for a waiting time based\nATSC algorithm and a corresponding detection strategy. Thus, the objectives of\nthis paper are to: (i) develop a \"slow poisoning\" attack generation strategy\nfor an ATSC, and (ii) develop a prediction-based \"slow poisoning\" attack\ndetection strategy using a recurrent neural network -- i.e., long short-term\nmemory model. We have generated a \"slow poisoning\" attack modeling strategy\nusing a microscopic traffic simulator -- Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) --\nand used generated data from the simulation to develop both the attack model\nand detection model.

With the\neffective spatio-temporal relationship modeling, it is possible not only to\nuncover contextual information in each frame but also to directly capture\ninter-time dependencies. It is more critical to capture the position changes of\nhuman and objects over the spatio-temporal dimension when their appearance\nfeatures may not show up significant changes over time.

Despite its growing\nimportance, there is scant large-scale academic research on the long-term\nevolution of user behaviour on these platforms, because the data are often\nproprietary to the platforms. Here, we evaluate the individual behaviour of\n600,000 Twitter users between 2012 and 2019 and find empirical evidence for an\nacceleration of the way Twitter is used on an individual level. This manifests\nitself in the fact that cohorts of Twitter users behave differently depending\non when they joined the platform. Behaviour within a cohort is relatively\nconsistent over time and characterised by strong internal interactions, but\nover time behaviour from cohort to cohort shifts towards increased activity.\nSpecifically, we measure this in terms of more tweets per user over time,\ndenser interactions with others via retweets, and shorter content horizons,\nexpressed as an individual's decaying autocorrelation of topics over time. Our\nobservations are explained by a growing proportion of active users who not only\ntweet more actively but also elicit more retweets.

The distribution of the data samples dynamically changes as the\nmodel is updated, introducing a complex feedback loop between the data\ndistribution and the reinforcement learning algorithm. We prove that, under a\ntime rescaling, the online actor-critic algorithm with tabular parametrization\nconverges to an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) as the number of updates\nbecomes large. The proof first establishes the geometric ergodicity of the data\nsamples under a fixed actor policy. Then, using a Poisson equation, we prove\nthat the fluctuations of the data samples around a dynamic probability measure,\nwhich is a function of the evolving actor model, vanish as the number of\nupdates become large. Once the ODE limit has been derived, we study its\nconvergence properties using a two time-scale analysis which asymptotically\nde-couples the critic ODE from the actor ODE. The convergence of the critic to\nthe solution of the Bellman equation and the actor to the optimal policy are\nproven. In addition, a convergence rate to this global minimum is also\nestablished.

One can buy crypto-currency called Ether of the Ethereum\nblockchain from exchanges and pay for the transaction fees. In the case of test\nnetworks (such as Rinkeby) or scientific research blockchains (such as\nBloxberg), free crypto-currency, Ether, is distributed to users via faucets.\nSince transaction slots on the blocks, storage and smart contract executions\nare consuming blockchain resources, Ethers are distributed by fixed small\namounts to users. Users may have different amount of Ether requirements; some\nsmall amounts and some large amounts during different times. As a result,\nrather than allowing the user to get a fixed small amount of Ether, a more\ngeneral distribution mechanism that allows a user to demand and claim arbitrary\namounts of Ether, while satisfying fairness among users, is needed. For this\nend, Max-min Fairness based schemes have been used in centralized settings. Our\nwork contributes a Max-min Fairness based algorithm and its Solidity smart\ncontract implementation that requires low transaction costs independent of the\nnumber of users. This is important on the Ethereum blockchain, since a smart\ncontract execution with transaction costs depending on the number of users\nwould mean block gas limit exhaustion problem will eventually be met, making\nthe smart contract ineffective. We report tests which confirm that the low\ntransaction cost aims have been achieved by our algorithm.",

    "abstract": "This article addresses the design of a discrete-time flatness-based tracking\ncontrol for a gantry crane and demonstrates the practical applicability of the\napproach by measurement results. The required sampled-data model is derived by\nan Euler-discretization with a prior state transformation in such a way that\nthe flatness of the continuous-time system is preserved. Like in the\ncontinuous-time case, the flatness-based controller design is performed in two\nsteps. First, the sampled-data system is exactly linearized by a discrete-time\nquasi-static state feedback. Subsequently, a further feedback enforces a stable\nlinear tracking error dynamics. To underline its practical relevance, the\nperformance of the novel discrete-time tracking control is compared to the\nclassical continuous-time approach by measurement results from a laboratory\nsetup. In particular, it turns out that the discrete-time controller is\nsignificantly more robust with respect to large sampling times. Moreover, it is\nshown how the discrete-time approach facilitates the design of optimal\nreference trajectories, and further measurement results are presented.",

    "abstract": "Tensor Train (TT) approach has been successfully applied in the modelling of\nthe multilinear interaction of features. Nevertheless, the existing models lack\nflexibility and generalizability, as they only model a single type of\nhigh-order correlation.

In this paper, we present a novel Residual Tensor\nTrain (ResTT) which integrates the merits of TT and residual structure to\ncapture the multilinear feature correlations, from low to higher orders, within\nthe same model. In particular, we prove that the fully-connected layer in\nneural networks and the Volterra series can be taken as special cases of ResTT.\nFurthermore, we derive the rule for weight initialization that stabilizes the\ntraining of ResTT based on a mean-field analysis. We prove that such a rule is\nmuch more relaxed than that of TT, which means ResTT can easily address the\nvanishing and exploding gradient problem that exists in the current TT models.\nNumerical experiments demonstrate that ResTT outperforms the state-of-the-art\ntensor network approaches, and is competitive with the benchmark deep learning\nmodels on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets.",

To\nmitigate the risk, it has become essential to capture the reputation of users\nbased on their trade histories.

Due to the dynamic nature of trust\nbetween individuals, these trust networks are often vulnerable to link or node\nfailures, making it critical to understand the stability of such systems. In\nthis paper, we consider the problem of quantifying the resiliency of signed\nnetworks with the help of trustworthy community structures.

    "abstract": "Approaching a set goal for a UAV comprises a trajectory plan and a controller\ndesign (control after plan problems). The optimal trajectory (reference) is\ncalculated before being tracked with a proper controller. It is believed that\nthe quadrotor will follow the designed trajectory totally in the trajectory\nplan process. However, the dynamic state error usually, for a mismatched\nfeed-forward, spoils this assumption, making the unwanted sacrifice in the\nobjective function defined in the trajectory plan process. We base the target\nproblem in this research on a second-order system model which widely exists in\nthe dynamics of vehicles. Specially, the unavoidable dynamic state error is\nconsidered in the trajectory plan process, assuming the LQR without the\nfeed-forward is applied in the subsequent control after plan problems. The\nCopenhagen Limit provides the possibility of estimating the dynamic state error\nin an analytical solution.

Various mitigations have been\nproposed to alleviate the problem, mainly in the form of language dialects,\nstatic program analysis, and code or binary instrumentation. Solutions like\nAdressSanitizer (ASan) and Softbound/CETS have proven that the latter approach\nis very promising, being able to achieve memory safety without requiring manual\nsource code adaptions, albeit suffering substantial performance and memory\noverheads. While performance overhead can be seen as a flexible constraint,\nextensive memory overheads can be prohibitive for the use of such solutions in\nmemory-constrained environments.

With its constant, very small\nmemory overhead (configurable up to 2 MB on x86-64) and constant complexity for\npointer access checking, MESH offers efficient, byte-precise spatial and\ntemporal memory safety for memory-constrained scenarios. Without jeopardizing\nthe security of safe heap objects, MESH is fully compatible with existing code\nand uninstrumented libraries, making it practical to use in heterogeneous\nenvironments. We show the feasibility of our approach with a full LLVM-based\nprototype supporting both major architectures, i.e., x86-64 and ARM64, in a\nLinux runtime environment.

We learn the spatial-aware 3D\nLUTs and fuse them according to the aforementioned weights in an end-to-end\nmanner. The fused LUT is then used to transform the source image into the\ntarget tone in an efficient way. Extensive results show that our model\noutperforms SOTA image enhancement methods on public datasets both subjectively\nand objectively, and that our model only takes about 4ms to process a 4K\nresolution image on one NVIDIA V100 GPU.",

    "abstract": "Fifth generation mobile networks (5G) are currently being deployed by mobile\noperators around the globe. 5G acts as an enabler for various use cases and\nalso improves the security and privacy over 4G and previous network\ngenerations. However, as recent security research has revealed, the standard\nstill has security weaknesses that may be exploitable by attackers. In\naddition, the migration from 4G to 5G systems is taking place by first\ndeploying 5G solutions in a non-standalone (NSA) manner where the first step of\nthe 5G deployment is restricted to the new radio aspects of 5G, while the\ncontrol of the user equipment is still based on 4G protocols, i.e. the core\nnetwork is still the legacy 4G evolved packet core (EPC) network. As a result,\nmany security vulnerabilities of 4G networks are still present in current 5G\ndeployments. This paper presents a systematic risk analysis of standalone and\nnon-standalone 5G networks. We first describe an overview of the 5G system\nspecification and the new security features of 5G compared to 4G. Then, we\ndefine possible threats according to the STRIDE threat classification model and\nderive a risk matrix based on the likelihood and impact of 12 threat scenarios\nthat affect the radio access and the network core. Finally, we discuss possible\nmitigations and security controls. Our analysis is generic and does not account\nfor the specifics of particular 5G network vendors or operators. Further work\nis required to understand the security vulnerabilities and risks of specific 5G\nimplementations and deployments.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a new interval type-2 fuzzy neural network able to construct\nnon-separable fuzzy rules with adaptive shapes is introduced. To reflect the\nuncertainty, the shape of fuzzy sets considered to be uncertain. Therefore, a\nnew form of interval type-2 fuzzy sets based on a general Gaussian model able\nto construct different shapes (including triangular, bell-shaped, trapezoidal)\nis proposed. To consider the interactions among input variables, input vectors\nare transformed to new feature spaces with uncorrelated variables proper for\ndefining each fuzzy rule. Next, the new features are fed to a fuzzification\nlayer using proposed interval type-2 fuzzy sets with adaptive shape.\nConsequently, interval type-2 non-separable fuzzy rules with proper shapes,\nconsidering the local interactions of variables and the uncertainty are formed.\nFor type reduction the contribution of the upper and lower firing strengths of\neach fuzzy rule are adaptively selected separately. To train different\nparameters of the network, the Levenberg-Marquadt optimization method is\nutilized. The performance of the proposed method is investigated on clean and\nnoisy datasets to show the ability to consider the uncertainty. Moreover, the\nproposed paradigm, is successfully applied to real-world time-series\npredictions, regression problems, and nonlinear system identification.\nAccording to the experimental results, the performance of our proposed model\noutperforms other methods with a more parsimonious structure.",

Each successive technique\ndemonstrates an improvement over existing methods by reporting higher image\nquality scores.

The\nfirst problem is the use of disparate evaluation conditions in terms of data\nand metric parameters, calling for a standardized protocol to make it possible\nto compare between papers. The second problem, which forms the main focus of\nthis paper, is the inherent difficulty in evaluating SI-HDR reconstructions\nsince certain aspects of the reconstruction problem dominate objective\ndifferences, thereby introducing a bias. Here, we reproduce a typical\nevaluation using existing as well as simulated SI-HDR methods to demonstrate\nhow different aspects of the problem affect objective quality metrics.\nSurprisingly, we found that methods that do not even reconstruct HDR\ninformation can compete with state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

However, 3D frequency-domain seismic modeling remains challenging\nsince it requires solving a large and sparse linear indefinite system per\nfrequency. When such systems are solved with direct methods or hybrid\ndirect/iterative solvers, based upon domain decomposition preconditioner,\nfinite-difference stencils on regular Cartesian grids should be designed to\nconciliate compactness and accuracy, the former being necessary to mitigate the\nfill-in induced by the Lower-Upper (LU) factorization. Compactness is\nclassically implemented by combining several second-order accurate stencils\ncovering the eight cells surrounding the collocation point, leading to the\nso-called 27-point stencil. Accuracy is obtained by applying optimal weights on\nthe different stiffness and consistent mass matrices such that numerical\ndispersion is jointly minimized for several number of grid points per\nwavelength ($G$). However, with this approach, the same weights are used at\neach collocation point, leading to suboptimal accuracy in heterogeneous media.\nIn this study, we propose a straightforward recipe to improve the accuracy of\nthe 27-point stencil. First, we finely tabulate the values of $G$ covering the\nrange of wavelengths spanned by the subsurface model and the frequency. Then,\nwe estimate with a classical dispersion analysis in homogeneous media the\ncorresponding table of optimal weights that minimize dispersion for each $G$\ntreated separately.

    "abstract": "Counting the number of occurrences of small connected subgraphs, called\ntemporal motifs, has become a fundamental primitive for the analysis of\ntemporal networks, whose edges are annotated with the time of the event they\nrepresent. One of the main complications in studying temporal motifs is the\nlarge number of motifs that can be built even with a limited number of vertices\nor edges. As a consequence, since in many applications motifs are employed for\nexploratory analyses, the user needs to iteratively select and analyze several\nmotifs that represent different aspects of the network, resulting in an\ninefficient, time-consuming process. This problem is exacerbated in large\nnetworks, where the analysis of even a single motif is computationally\ndemanding. As a solution, in this work we propose and study the problem of\nsimultaneously counting the number of occurrences of multiple temporal motifs,\nall corresponding to the same (static) topology (e.g., a triangle). Given that\nfor large temporal networks computing the exact counts is unfeasible, we\npropose odeN, a sampling-based algorithm that provides an accurate\napproximation of all the counts of the motifs. We provide analytical bounds on\nthe number of samples required by odeN to compute rigorous, probabilistic,\nrelative approximations. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that odeN\nenables the approximation of the counts of motifs in temporal networks in a\nfraction of the time needed by state-of-the-art methods, and that it also\nreports more accurate approximations than such methods.",

In this study, we present SiReN, a new\nsign-aware recommender system based on GNN models. Specifically, SiReN has\nthree key components: 1) constructing a signed bipartite graph for more\nprecisely representing users' preferences, which is split into two\nedge-disjoint graphs with positive and negative edges each, 2) generating two\nembeddings for the partitioned graphs with positive and negative edges via a\nGNN model and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), respectively, and then using an\nattention model to obtain the final embeddings, and 3) establishing a\nsign-aware Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) loss function in the process of\noptimization. Through comprehensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate\nthat SiReN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NE-aided recommendation\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Location of non-stationary forced oscillation (FO) sources can be a\nchallenging task, especially in cases under resonance condition with natural\nsystem modes, where the magnitudes of the oscillations could be greater in\nplaces far from the source. Therefore, it is of interest to construct a global\ntime-frequency (TF) representation (TFR) of the system, which can capture the\noscillatory components present in the system. In this paper we develop a\nsystematic methodology for frequency identification and component filtering of\nnon-stationary power system forced oscillations (FO) based on multi-channel\nTFR. The frequencies of the oscillatory components are identified on the TF\nplane by applying a modified ridge estimation algorithm. Then, filtering of the\ncomponents is carried out on the TF plane applying the anti-transform functions\nover the individual TFRs around the identified ridges. This step constitutes an\ninitial stage for the application of the Dissipating Energy Flow (DEF) method\nused to locate FO sources. Besides, we compare three TF approaches: short-time\nFourier transform (STFT), STFT-based synchrosqueezing transform (FSST) and\nsecond order FSST (FSST2). Simulated signals and signals from real operation\nare used to show that the proposed method provides a systematic framework for\nidentification and filtering of power systems non-stationary forced\noscillations.",

To demarcate\nbetween a claim and a non-claim is arduous for both humans and machines, owing\nto latent linguistic variance between the two and the inadequacy of extensive\ndefinition-based formalization. Furthermore, the increase in the usage of\nonline social media has resulted in an explosion of unsolicited information on\nthe web presented as informal text. To account for the aforementioned, in this\npaper, we proposed DESYR. It is a framework that intends on annulling the said\nissues for informal web-based text by leveraging a combination of hierarchical\nrepresentation learning (dependency-inspired Poincare embedding),\ndefinition-based alignment, and feature projection. We do away with fine-tuning\ncomputer-heavy language models in favor of fabricating a more domain-centric\nbut lighter approach. Experimental results indicate that DESYR builds upon the\nstate-of-the-art system across four benchmark claim datasets, most of which\nwere constructed with informal texts.

    "abstract": "Deep networks often make confident, yet incorrect, predictions when tested\nwith outlier data that is far removed from their training distributions.\nLikelihoods computed by deep generative models are a candidate metric for\noutlier detection with unlabeled data. Yet, previous studies have shown that\nsuch likelihoods are unreliable and can be easily biased by simple\ntransformations to input data. Here, we examine outlier detection with\nvariational autoencoders (VAEs), among the simplest class of deep generative\nmodels. First, we show that a theoretically-grounded correction readily\nameliorates a key bias with VAE likelihood estimates. The bias correction is\nmodel-free, sample-specific, and accurately computed with the Bernoulli and\ncontinuous Bernoulli visible distributions. Second, we show that a well-known\npreprocessing technique, contrast normalization, extends the effectiveness of\nbias correction to natural image datasets. Third, we show that the variance of\nthe likelihoods computed over an ensemble of VAEs also enables robust outlier\ndetection. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of our remedies with nine\n(grayscale and natural) image datasets, and demonstrate significant advantages,\nin terms of both speed and accuracy, over four other state-of-the-art methods.\nOur lightweight remedies are biologically inspired and may serve to achieve\nefficient outlier detection with many types of deep generative models.",

    "abstract": "Virtual Reality (VR) games that feature physical activities have been shown\nto increase players' motivation to do physical exercise. However, for such\nexercises to have a positive healthcare effect, they have to be repeated\nseveral times a week. To maintain player motivation over longer periods of\ntime, games often employ Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) to adapt the\ngame's challenge according to the player's capabilities. For exercise games,\nthis is mostly done by tuning specific in-game parameters like the speed of\nobjects. In this work, we propose to use experience-driven Procedural Content\nGeneration for DDA in VR exercise games by procedurally generating levels that\nmatch the player's current capabilities. Not only finetuning specific\nparameters but creating completely new levels has the potential to decrease\nrepetition over longer time periods and allows for the simultaneous adaptation\nof the cognitive and physical challenge of the exergame. As a proof-of-concept,\nwe implement an initial prototype in which the player must traverse a maze that\nincludes several exercise rooms, whereby the generation of the maze is realized\nby a neural network. Passing those exercise rooms requires the player to\nperform physical activities. To match the player's capabilities, we use Deep\nReinforcement Learning to adjust the structure of the maze and to decide which\nexercise rooms to include in the maze.

Prior work studied this problem assuming that the target\nhalfspace is homogeneous and that the parameter $\\eta$ is strictly smaller than\n$1/2$.

    "abstract": "Clustered Federated Multitask Learning (CFL) was introduced as an efficient\nscheme to obtain reliable specialized models when data is imbalanced and\ndistributed in a non-i.i.d. (non-independent and identically distributed)\nfashion amongst clients. While a similarity measure metric, like the cosine\nsimilarity, can be used to endow groups of the client with a specialized model,\nthis process can be arduous as the server should involve all clients in each of\nthe federated learning rounds. Therefore, it is imperative that a subset of\nclients is selected periodically due to the limited bandwidth and latency\nconstraints at the network edge. To this end, this paper proposes a new client\nselection algorithm that aims to accelerate the convergence rate for obtaining\nspecialized machine learning models that achieve high test accuracies for all\nclient groups. Specifically, we introduce a client selection approach that\nleverages the devices' heterogeneity to schedule the clients based on their\nround latency and exploits the bandwidth reuse for clients that consume more\ntime to update the model. Then, the server performs model averaging and\nclusters the clients based on predefined thresholds. When a specific cluster\nreaches a stationary point, the proposed algorithm uses a greedy scheduling\nalgorithm for that group by selecting the clients with less latency to update\nthe model. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach lowers the\ntraining time and accelerates the convergence rate by up to 50% while imbuing\neach client with a specialized model that is fit for its local data\ndistribution.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we aim to calibrate the score outputs of an estimator for the\nbinary classification problem by finding an 'optimal' mapping to class\nprobabilities, where the 'optimal' mapping is in the sense that minimizes the\nclassification error (or equivalently, maximizes the accuracy). We show that\nfor the given target variables and the score outputs of an estimator, an\n'optimal' soft mapping, which monotonically maps the score values to\nprobabilities, is a hard mapping that maps the score values to $0$ and $1$. We\nshow that for class weighted (where the accuracy for one class is more\nimportant) and sample weighted (where the samples' accurate classifications are\nnot equally important) errors, or even general linear losses; this hard mapping\ncharacteristic is preserved. We propose a sequential recursive merger approach,\nwhich produces an 'optimal' hard mapping (for the observed samples so far)\nsequentially with each incoming new sample. Our approach has a logarithmic in\nsample size time complexity, which is optimally efficient.",

    "title": "Causal Attention for Unbiased Visual Recognition",
    "abstract": "Attention module does not always help deep models learn causal features that\nare robust in any confounding context, e.g., a foreground object feature is\ninvariant to different backgrounds. This is because the confounders trick the\nattention to capture spurious correlations that benefit the prediction when the\ntraining and testing data are IID (identical & independent distribution); while\nharm the prediction when the data are OOD (out-of-distribution). The sole\nfundamental solution to learn causal attention is by causal intervention, which\nrequires additional annotations of the confounders, e.g., a \"dog\" model is\nlearned within \"grass+dog\" and \"road+dog\" respectively, so the \"grass\" and\n\"road\" contexts will no longer confound the \"dog\" recognition. However, such\nannotation is not only prohibitively expensive, but also inherently\nproblematic, as the confounders are elusive in nature. In this paper, we\npropose a causal attention module (CaaM) that self-annotates the confounders in\nunsupervised fashion. In particular, multiple CaaMs can be stacked and\nintegrated in conventional attention CNN and self-attention Vision Transformer.\nIn OOD settings, deep models with CaaM outperform those without it\nsignificantly; even in IID settings, the attention localization is also\nimproved by CaaM, showing a great potential in applications that require robust\nvisual saliency.

As a\nresult, the de facto statistical measures (MSE, MAE) exhibit large variance and\ntend to be unreliable indicators of performance across the count range. To\naddress these concerns in a holistic manner, we revise processes at various\nstages of the standard crowd counting pipeline. To enable principled and\nbalanced minibatch sampling, we propose a novel smoothed Bayesian sample\nstratification approach.

We analyze the performance of representative crowd\ncounting approaches across standard datasets at per strata level and in\naggregate. We analyze the performance of crowd counting approaches across\nstandard datasets and demonstrate that our proposed modifications noticeably\nreduce error standard deviation.

Monitoring player impacts is vitally important to\nunderstanding and protecting from injuries like concussion. Typically, to\nanalyze this data, a combination of video analysis and sensor data is used to\nascertain the recorded events are true impacts and not false positives. In\nfact, due to the nature of using wearable devices in sports, false positives\nvastly outnumber the true positives. Yet, manual video analysis is\ntime-consuming. This imbalance leads traditional machine learning approaches to\nexhibit poor performance in both detecting true positives and preventing false\nnegatives. Here, we show that by simulating head impacts numerically using a\nstandard Finite Element head-neck model, a large dataset of synthetic impacts\ncan be created to augment the gathered, verified, impact data from mouthguards.\nThis combined physics-informed machine learning impact detector reported\nimproved performance on test datasets compared to traditional impact detectors\nwith negative predictive value and positive predictive values of 88% and 87%\nrespectively. Consequently, this model reported the best results to date for an\nimpact detection algorithm for American Football, achieving an F1 score of\n0.95. In addition, this physics-informed machine learning impact detector was\nable to accurately detect true and false impacts from a test dataset at a rate\nof 90% and 100% relative to a purely manual video analysis workflow.

    "abstract": "A new two-dimensional model for blood flows in arteries with arbitrary cross\nsections is derived. The model consists of a system of balance laws for\nconservation of mass and balance of momentum in the axial and angular\ndirections. The equations are derived by applying asymptotic analysis to the\nincompressible Navier-Stokes equations in narrow, large vessels and integrating\nin the radial direction in each cross section. The main properties of the\nsystem are discussed and a positivity-preserving well-balanced central-upwind\nscheme is presented. The merits of the scheme will be tested in a variety of\nscenarios. In particular, numerical results of simulations using an idealized\naorta model are shown. We analyze the time evolution of the blood flow under\ndifferent initial conditions such as perturbations to steady states consisting\nof a bulging in the vessel's wall. We consider different situations given by\ndistinct variations in the vessel's elasticity.",

    "abstract": "In their breakthrough ICALP'15 paper, Bernstein and Stein presented an\nalgorithm for maintaining a $(3/2+\\epsilon)$-approximate maximum matching in\nfully dynamic {\\em bipartite} graphs with a {\\em worst-case} update time of\n$O_\\epsilon(m^{1/4})$; we use the $O_\\epsilon$ notation to suppress the\n$\\epsilon$-dependence. Their main technical contribution was in presenting a\nnew type of bounded-degree subgraph, which they named an {\\em edge degree\nconstrained subgraph (EDCS)}, which contains a large matching -- of size that\nis smaller than the maximum matching size of the entire graph by at most a\nfactor of $3/2+\\epsilon$. They demonstrate that the EDCS can be maintained with\na worst-case update time of $O_\\epsilon(m^{1/4})$, and their main result\nfollows as a direct corollary.

A large image database or online search engine is inevitably required\nfor retrieving such exemplars. Recent deep-learning-based methods could\nautomatically colorize images at a low cost. However, unsatisfactory artifacts\nand incoherent colors are always accompanied. In this work, we aim at\nrecovering vivid colors by leveraging the rich and diverse color priors\nencapsulated in a pretrained Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).\nSpecifically, we first \"retrieve\" matched features (similar to exemplars) via a\nGAN encoder and then incorporate these features into the colorization process\nwith feature modulations. Thanks to the powerful generative color prior and\ndelicate designs, our method could produce vivid colors with a single forward\npass. Moreover, it is highly convenient to obtain diverse results by modifying\nGAN latent codes. Our method also inherits the merit of interpretable controls\nof GANs and could attain controllable and smooth transitions by walking through\nGAN latent space. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves superior performance than previous works.",

    "abstract": "Autoregressive models and their sequential factorization of the data\nlikelihood have recently demonstrated great potential for image representation\nand synthesis. Nevertheless, they incorporate image context in a linear 1D\norder by attending only to previously synthesized image patches above or to the\nleft. Not only is this unidirectional, sequential bias of attention unnatural\nfor images as it disregards large parts of a scene until synthesis is almost\ncomplete. It also processes the entire image on a single scale, thus ignoring\nmore global contextual information up to the gist of the entire scene. As a\nremedy we incorporate a coarse-to-fine hierarchy of context by combining the\nautoregressive formulation with a multinomial diffusion process: Whereas a\nmultistage diffusion process successively removes information to coarsen an\nimage, we train a (short) Markov chain to invert this process. In each stage,\nthe resulting autoregressive ImageBART model progressively incorporates context\nfrom previous stages in a coarse-to-fine manner. Experiments show greatly\nimproved image modification capabilities over autoregressive models while also\nproviding high-fidelity image generation, both of which are enabled through\nefficient training in a compressed latent space. Specifically, our approach can\ntake unrestricted, user-provided masks into account to perform local image\nediting. Thus, in contrast to pure autoregressive models, it can solve\nfree-form image inpainting and, in the case of conditional models, local,\ntext-guided image modification without requiring mask-specific training.",

    "abstract": "Point clouds captured in real-world applications are often incomplete due to\nthe limited sensor resolution, single viewpoint, and occlusion. Therefore,\nrecovering the complete point clouds from partial ones becomes an indispensable\ntask in many practical applications. In this paper, we present a new method\nthat reformulates point cloud completion as a set-to-set translation problem\nand design a new model, called PoinTr that adopts a transformer encoder-decoder\narchitecture for point cloud completion. By representing the point cloud as a\nset of unordered groups of points with position embeddings, we convert the\npoint cloud to a sequence of point proxies and employ the transformers for\npoint cloud generation. To facilitate transformers to better leverage the\ninductive bias about 3D geometric structures of point clouds, we further devise\na geometry-aware block that models the local geometric relationships\nexplicitly. The migration of transformers enables our model to better learn\nstructural knowledge and preserve detailed information for point cloud\ncompletion. Furthermore, we propose two more challenging benchmarks with more\ndiverse incomplete point clouds that can better reflect the real-world\nscenarios to promote future research.

Although these approaches have largely been\nsuccessful, they are predominantly image-based and therefore do not exploit the\ntemporal properties of the kernels across multiple video frames. In this paper,\nwe investigated the temporal properties of the kernels and highlighted its\nimportance in the task of blind video super-resolution. Specifically, we\nmeasured the kernel temporal consistency of real-world videos and illustrated\nhow the estimated kernels might change per frame in videos of varying\ndynamicity of the scene and its objects. With this new insight, we revisited\nprevious popular video SR approaches, and showed that previous assumptions of\nusing a fixed kernel throughout the restoration process can lead to visual\nartifacts when upscaling real-world videos. In order to counteract this, we\ntailored existing single-image and video SR techniques to leverage kernel\nconsistency during both kernel estimation and video upscaling processes.\nExtensive experiments on synthetic and real-world videos show substantial\nrestoration gains quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving the new\nstate-of-the-art in blind video SR and underlining the potential of exploiting\nkernel temporal consistency.",

    "abstract": "Freight carriers rely on tactical plans to satisfy demand in a cost-effective\nway. For computational tractability in real large-scale settings, such plans\nare typically computed by solving deterministic and cyclic formulations. An\nimportant input is the periodic demand, i.e., the demand that is expected to\nrepeat in each period of the planning horizon. Motivated by the discrepancy\nbetween time series forecasts of demand in each period and the periodic demand,\nLaage et al. (2021) recently introduced the Periodic Demand Estimation (PDE)\nproblem and showed that it has a high value. However, they made strong\nassumptions on the solution space so that the problem could be solved by\nenumeration. In this paper we significantly extend their work. We propose a new\nPDE formulation that relaxes the strong assumptions on the solution space. We\nsolve large instances of this formulation with a two-step heuristic. The first\nstep reduces the dimension of the feasible space by performing clustering of\ncommodities based on instance-specific information about demand and supply\ninteractions. The formulation along with the first step allow to solve the\nproblem in a second step by either metaheuristics or the state-of-the-art\nblack-box optimization solver NOMAD.

    "abstract": "The performance of a quantum information processing protocol is ultimately\njudged by distinguishability measures that quantify how distinguishable the\nactual result of the protocol is from the ideal case. The most prominent\ndistinguishability measures are those based on the fidelity and trace distance,\ndue to their physical interpretations. In this paper, we propose and review\nseveral algorithms for estimating distinguishability measures based on trace\ndistance and fidelity, and we evaluate their performance using simulators of\nquantum computers. The algorithms can be used for distinguishing quantum\nstates, channels, and strategies (the last also known in the literature as\n\"quantum combs\"). The fidelity-based algorithms offer novel physical\ninterpretations of these distinguishability measures in terms of the maximum\nprobability with which a single prover (or competing provers) can convince a\nverifier to accept the outcome of an associated computation. We simulate these\nalgorithms by using a variational approach with parameterized quantum circuits\nand find that they converge well for the examples that we consider.",

While many radiomics methods have been described in the literature,\nthese are generally designed for a single application. The aim of this study is\nto generalize radiomics across applications by proposing a framework to\nautomatically construct and optimize the radiomics workflow per application. To\nthis end, we formulate radiomics as a modular workflow, consisting of several\ncomponents: image and segmentation preprocessing, feature extraction, feature\nand sample preprocessing, and machine learning. For each component, a\ncollection of common algorithms is included. To optimize the workflow per\napplication, we employ automated machine learning using a random search and\nensembling. We evaluate our method in twelve different clinical applications,\nresulting in the following area under the curves: 1) liposarcoma (0.83); 2)\ndesmoid-type fibromatosis (0.82); 3) primary liver tumors (0.81); 4)\ngastrointestinal stromal tumors (0.77); 5) colorectal liver metastases (0.68);\n6) melanoma metastases (0.51); 7) hepatocellular carcinoma (0.75); 8)\nmesenteric fibrosis (0.81); 9) prostate cancer (0.72); 10) glioma (0.70); 11)\nAlzheimer's disease (0.87); and 12) head and neck cancer (0.84).

    "abstract": "A resilient and robust positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) system is a\nnecessity for the navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Global Navigation\nSatelite System (GNSS) provides satellite-based PNT services. However, a\nspoofer can temper an authentic GNSS signal and could transmit wrong position\ninformation to an AV. Therefore, a GNSS must have the capability of real-time\ndetection and feedback-correction of spoofing attacks related to PNT receivers,\nwhereby it will help the end-user (autonomous vehicle in this case) to navigate\nsafely if it falls into any compromises. This paper aims to develop a deep\nreinforcement learning (RL)-based turn-by-turn spoofing attack detection using\nlow-cost in-vehicle sensor data. We have utilized Honda Driving Dataset to\ncreate attack and non-attack datasets, develop a deep RL model, and evaluate\nthe performance of the RL-based attack detection model. We find that the\naccuracy of the RL model ranges from 99.99% to 100%, and the recall value is\n100%. However, the precision ranges from 93.44% to 100%, and the f1 score\nranges from 96.61% to 100%. Overall, the analyses reveal that the RL model is\neffective in turn-by-turn spoofing attack detection.",

The anticommutation\nrelation for fermions is usually implemented to a variational wave function by\nthe Slater determinant (or Pfaffian), which is a computational bottleneck\nbecause of the numerical cost of $O(N^3)$ for $N$ particles. We bypass this\nbottleneck by explicitly calculating the sign changes associated with particle\nexchanges in real space and using fully connected neural networks for\noptimizing the rest parts of the wave function. This reduces the computational\ncost to $O(N^2)$ or less. We show that the accuracy of the approximation can be\nimproved by optimizing the \"variance\" of the energy simultaneously with the\nenergy itself. We also find that a reweighting method in Monte Carlo sampling\ncan stabilize the calculation. These improvements can be applied to other\napproaches based on variational Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, we show that the\naccuracy can be further improved by using the symmetry of the system, the\nrepresentative states, and an additional neural network implementing a\ngeneralized Gutzwiller-Jastrow factor.

This mapping is enabled by the complex evolution matrix\nof a photonic lattice with diagonal disorder, which turns out to be a random\ncomplex Gaussian matrix. Thus, by collecting the output light from a subset of\nthe waveguide channels, one can perform an embedding from a higher-dimension to\na lower-dimension space that respects the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma and\nnearly preserves the Euclidean distances.

The\nsystem comprises multiple agents in this problem, each with a set of local data\npoints and an associated local cost function. The agents are connected to a\nserver, and there is no inter-agent communication. The agents' goal is to learn\na parameter vector that optimizes the aggregate of their local costs without\nrevealing their local data points. In principle, the agents can solve this\nproblem by collaborating with the server using the traditional distributed\ngradient-descent method. However, when the aggregate cost is ill-conditioned,\nthe gradient-descent method (i) requires a large number of iterations to\nconverge, and (ii) is highly unstable against process noise. We propose an\niterative pre-conditioning technique to mitigate the deleterious effects of the\ncost function's conditioning on the convergence rate of distributed\ngradient-descent. Unlike the conventional pre-conditioning techniques, the\npre-conditioner matrix in our proposed technique updates iteratively to\nfacilitate implementation on the distributed network. In the distributed\nsetting, we provably show that the proposed algorithm converges linearly with\nan improved rate of convergence than the traditional and adaptive\ngradient-descent methods. Additionally, for the special case when the minimizer\nof the aggregate cost is unique, our algorithm converges superlinearly. We\ndemonstrate our algorithm's superior performance compared to prominent\ndistributed algorithms for solving real logistic regression problems and\nemulating neural network training via a noisy quadratic model, thereby\nsignifying the proposed algorithm's efficiency for distributively solving\nnon-convex optimization.

    "abstract": "As current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices suffer from\ndecoherence errors, any delay in the instruction execution of quantum control\nmicroarchitecture can lead to the loss of quantum information and incorrect\ncomputation results. Hence, it is crucial for the control microarchitecture to\nissue quantum operations to the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) in time. As in\nclassical microarchitecture, parallelism in quantum programs needs to be\nexploited for speedup. However, three challenges emerge in the quantum\nscenario: 1) the quantum feedback control can introduce significant pipeline\nstall latency; 2) timing control is required for all quantum operations; 3) QPU\nrequires a deterministic operation supply to prevent the accumulation of\nquantum errors.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel control microarchitecture design to exploit\nCircuit Level Parallelism (CLP) and Quantum Operation Level Parallelism (QOLP).\nFirstly, we develop a Multiprocessor architecture to exploit CLP, which\nsupports dynamic scheduling of different sub-circuits. This architecture can\nhandle parallel feedback control and minimize the potential overhead that\ndisrupts the timing control. Secondly, we propose a Quantum Superscalar\napproach that exploits QOLP by efficiently executing massive quantum\ninstructions in parallel. Both methods issue quantum operations to QPU\ndeterministically. In the benchmark test of a Shor syndrome measurement, a\nsix-core implementation of our proposal achieves up to 2.59$\\times$ speedup\ncompared with a single core. For various canonical quantum computing\nalgorithms, our superscalar approach achieves an average of 4.04$\\times$\nimprovement over a baseline design. Finally, We perform a simultaneous\nrandomized benchmarking (simRB) experiment on a real QPU using the proposed\nmicroarchitecture for validation.",

    "abstract": "In this work we build a unifying framework to interpolate between\ndensity-driven and geometry-based algorithms for data clustering, and\nspecifically, to connect the mean shift algorithm with spectral clustering at\ndiscrete and continuum levels. We seek this connection through the introduction\nof Fokker-Planck equations on data graphs. Besides introducing new forms of\nmean shift algorithms on graphs, we provide new theoretical insights on the\nbehavior of the family of diffusion maps in the large sample limit as well as\nprovide new connections between diffusion maps and mean shift dynamics on a\nfixed graph. Several numerical examples illustrate our theoretical findings and\nhighlight the benefits of interpolating density-driven and geometry-based\nclustering algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Any industrial system goes along with objectives to be met (e.g. economic\nperformance), disturbances to handle (e.g. market fluctuations, catalyst decay,\nunexpected variations in uncontrolled flow rates and compositions,...), and\nuncertainties about its behavior. In response to these, decisions must be taken\nand instructions be sent to the operators to drive and maintain the plant at\nsatisfactory, yet potentially changing operating conditions.\nOver the past thirty years many methods have been created and developed to\nanswer these questions. In particular, the field of Real-Time Optimization\n(RTO) has emerged that, among others, encompasses methods that allow the\nsystematic improvement of the performances of the industrial system, using\nplant measurements and a potentially inaccurate tool to predict its behaviour,\ngenerally in the form of a model. Even though the definition of RTO can differ\nbetween authors, inside and outside the process systems engineering community,\nthere is currently no RTO method, which is deemed capable of fully automating\nthe aforementioned decision-making process. This thesis consists of a series of\ncontributions in this direction, which brings RTO closer to being capable of a\nfull plant automation.\nKeywords: Real-time optimization, Decision-making, Optimization,\nReduced-order-model optimization, Autopilot for steady-state processes,\nOperational research.",

    "abstract": "Non-intrusive speech quality assessment is a crucial operation in multimedia\napplications. The scarcity of annotated data and the lack of a reference signal\nrepresent some of the main challenges for designing efficient quality\nassessment metrics. In this paper, we propose two multi-task models to tackle\nthe problems above. In the first model, we first learn a feature representation\nwith a degradation classifier on a large dataset. Then we perform MOS\nprediction and degradation classification simultaneously on a small dataset\nannotated with MOS. In the second approach, the initial stage consists of\nlearning features with a deep clustering-based unsupervised feature\nrepresentation on the large dataset. Next, we perform MOS prediction and\ncluster label classification simultaneously on a small dataset. The results\nshow that the deep clustering-based model outperforms the degradation\nclassifier-based model and the 3 baselines (autoencoder features, P.563, and\nSRMRnorm) on TCD-VoIP. This paper indicates that multi-task learning combined\nwith feature representations from unlabelled data is a promising approach to\ndeal with the lack of large MOS annotated datasets.",

    "abstract": "Kernels ensuing from tree ensembles such as random forest (RF) or gradient\nboosted trees (GBT), when used for kernel learning, have been shown to be\ncompetitive to their respective tree ensembles (particularly in higher\ndimensional scenarios). On the other hand, it has been also shown that\nperformance of the kernel algorithms depends on the degree of the kernel-target\nalignment. However, the kernel-target alignment for kernel learning based on\nthe tree ensembles has not been investigated and filling this gap is the main\ngoal of our work.\nUsing the eigenanalysis of the kernel matrix, we demonstrate that for\ncontinuous targets good performance of the tree-based kernel learning is\nassociated with strong kernel-target alignment. Moreover, we show that well\nperforming tree ensemble based kernels are characterized by strong target\naligned components that are expressed through scalar products between the\neigenvectors of the kernel matrix and the target. This suggests that when tree\nensemble based kernel learning is successful, relevant information for the\nsupervised problem is concentrated near lower dimensional manifold spanned by\nthe target aligned components. Persistence of the strong target aligned\ncomponents in tree ensemble based kernels is further supported by sensitivity\nanalysis via landmark learning. In addition to a comprehensive simulation\nstudy, we also provide experimental results from several real life data sets\nthat are in line with the simulations.",

    "abstract": "Classes of set functions along with a choice of ground set are a bedrock to\ndetermine and develop corresponding variants of greedy algorithms to obtain\nefficient solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. The class of\napproximate constrained submodular optimization has seen huge advances at the\nintersection of good computational efficiency, versatility and approximation\nguarantees while exact solutions for unconstrained submodular optimization are\nNP-hard. What is an alternative to situations when submodularity does not hold?\nCan efficient and globally exact solutions be obtained? We introduce one such\nnew frontier: The class of quasi-concave set functions induced as a dual class\nto monotone linkage functions. We provide a parallel algorithm with a time\ncomplexity over $n$ processors of $\\mathcal{O}(n^2g)\n+\\mathcal{O}(\\log{\\log{n}})$ where $n$ is the cardinality of the ground set and\n$g$ is the complexity to compute the monotone linkage function that induces a\ncorresponding quasi-concave set function via a duality. The complexity reduces\nto $\\mathcal{O}(gn\\log(n))$ on $n^2$ processors and to $\\mathcal{O}(gn)$ on\n$n^3$ processors. Our algorithm provides a globally optimal solution to a\nmaxi-min problem as opposed to submodular optimization which is approximate. We\nshow a potential for widespread applications via an example of diverse feature\nsubset selection with exact global maxi-min guarantees upon showing that a\nstatistical dependency measure called distance correlation can be used to\ninduce a quasi-concave set function.",

    "abstract": "The world is going through a challenging phase due to the disastrous effect\ncaused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the healthcare system and the economy. The\nrate of spreading, post-COVID-19 symptoms, and the occurrence of new strands of\nCOVID-19 have put the healthcare systems in disruption across the globe. Due to\nthis, the task of accurately screening COVID-19 cases has become of utmost\npriority. Since the virus infects the respiratory system, Chest X-Ray is an\nimaging modality that is adopted extensively for the initial screening. We have\nperformed a comprehensive study that uses CXR images to identify COVID-19 cases\nand realized the necessity of having a more generalizable model. We utilize\nMobileNetV2 architecture as the feature extractor and integrate it into Capsule\nNetworks to construct a fully automated and lightweight model termed as\nMobileCaps. MobileCaps is trained and evaluated on the publicly available\ndataset with the model ensembling and Bayesian optimization strategies to\nefficiently classify CXR images of patients with COVID-19 from non-COVID-19\npneumonia and healthy cases. The proposed model is further evaluated on two\nadditional RT-PCR confirmed datasets to demonstrate the generalizability. We\nalso introduce MobileCaps-S and leverage it for performing severity assessment\nof CXR images of COVID-19 based on the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema\n(RALE) scoring technique. Our classification model achieved an overall recall\nof 91.60, 94.60, 92.20, and a precision of 98.50, 88.21, 92.62 for COVID-19,\nnon-COVID-19 pneumonia, and healthy cases, respectively. Further, the severity\nassessment model attained an R$^2$ coefficient of 70.51. Owing to the fact that\nthe proposed models have fewer trainable parameters than the state-of-the-art\nmodels reported in the literature, we believe our models will go a long way in\naiding healthcare systems in the battle against the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Persistent homology is a leading tool in topological data analysis (TDA).\nMany problems in TDA can be solved via homological -- and indeed, linear --\nalgebra. However, matrices in this domain are typically large, with rows and\ncolumns numbered in billions. Low-rank approximation of such arrays typically\ndestroys essential information; thus, new mathematical and computational\nparadigms are needed for very large, sparse matrices.\nWe present the U-match matrix factorization scheme to address this challenge.\nU-match has two desirable features. First, it admits a compressed storage\nformat that reduces the number of nonzero entries held in computer memory by\none or more orders of magnitude over other common factorizations. Second, it\npermits direct solution of diverse problems in linear and homological algebra,\nwithout decompressing matrices stored in memory. These problems include look-up\nand retrieval of rows and columns; evaluation of birth/death times, and\nextraction of generators in persistent (co)homology; and, calculation of bases\nfor boundary and cycle subspaces of filtered chain complexes. Such bases are\nkey to unlocking a range of other topological techniques for use in TDA, and\nU-match factorization is designed to make such calculations broadly accessible\nto practitioners.\nAs an application, we show that individual cycle representatives in\npersistent homology can be retrieved at time and memory costs orders of\nmagnitude below current state of the art, via global duality. Moreover, the\nalgebraic machinery needed to achieve this computation already exists in many\nmodern solvers.",
