    "abstract": "Suppose there is a message generated at a node $v$ in a network and $v$\ndecides to pass the message to one of the neighbors $u$, and $u$ next decides\nto pass the message to one of its own neighbors, and so on. How to relay the\nmessage as far as possible with local decisions? To the best of our knowledge\nno general solution other than randomly picking available adjacent node exists.\nHere we report some progress. Our first contribution is a new framework called\n\\tp-separate chain decomposition for studying network structures. Each\n\\tp-separate chain induces a ranking of nodes. We then prove that the ranks can\nbe locally and distributively computed via searching some stable states of\ncertain dynamical systems on the network and can be used to search long paths\nof a guaranteed length containing any given node. Numerical analyses on a\nnumber of typical real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the\napproach.",

    "abstract": "The Active Flux scheme is a Finite Volume scheme with additional point values\ndistributed along the cell boundary. It is third order accurate and does not\nrequire a Riemann solver: the continuous reconstruction serves as initial data\nfor the evolution of the points values. The intercell flux is then obtained\nfrom the evolved values along the cell boundary by quadrature. This paper\nfocuses on the conceptual extension of Active Flux to include source terms, and\nthus for simplicity assumes the homogeneous part of the equations to be linear.\nTo a large part, the treatment of the source terms is independent of the choice\nof the homogeneous part of the system. Additionally, only systems are\nconsidered which admit characteristics (instead of characteristic cones). This\nis the case for scalar equations in any number of spatial dimensions and\nsystems in one spatial dimension. Here, we succeed to extend the Active Flux\nmethod to include (possibly nonlinear) source terms while maintaining third\norder accuracy of the method. This requires a novel (approximate) operator for\nthe evolution of point values and a modified update procedure of the cell\naverage. For linear acoustics with gravity, it is shown how to achieve a\nwell-balanced / stationarity preserving numerical method.",

Automated segmentation of fundus\nphotographs would improve the quality, capacity, and cost-effectiveness of eye\ncare screening programs. However, current segmentation methods are not robust\ntowards the diversity in imaging conditions and pathologies typical for\nreal-world clinical applications. To overcome these limitations, we utilized\ncontrastive self-supervised learning to exploit the large variety of unlabeled\nfundus images in the publicly available EyePACS dataset. We pre-trained an\nencoder of a U-Net, which we later fine-tuned on several retinal vessel and\nlesion segmentation datasets.

Furthermore, when fine-tuned on a downstream blood vessel\nsegmentation task, such pre-trained networks achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on images from different datasets. Additionally, the pre-training\nalso leads to shorter training times and an improved few-shot performance on\nboth blood vessel and lesion segmentation tasks.

An important aspect of LoL is competitive\nranked play, which utilizes a skill-based matchmaking system to form fair\nteams. However, players' skill levels vary widely depending on which champion,\nor hero, that they choose to play as. In this paper, we propose a method for\npredicting game outcomes in ranked LoL games based on players' experience with\ntheir selected champion. Using a deep neural network, we found that game\noutcomes can be predicted with 75.1% accuracy after all players have selected\nchampions, which occurs before gameplay begins. Our results have important\nimplications for playing LoL and matchmaking. Firstly, individual champion\nskill plays a significant role in the outcome of a match, regardless of team\ncomposition. Secondly, even after the skill-based matchmaking, there is still a\nwide variance in team skill before gameplay begins.

The geometric accuracy of the\ngenerated point clouds has been evaluated against both airborne and terrestrial\nLiDAR point clouds, achieving an average distance of 12 cm and 16 cm for roof\nand facade respectively. We propose a hierarchical volumetric change detection\nframework that unifies multi-temporal UAV images for pose estimation (free of\nground control points), reconstruction, and a coarse-to-fine 3D density change\nanalysis. This work has provided a solution capable of addressing change\ndetection on full 3D time-series datasets where dramatic scene content changes\nare presented progressively. Our change detection results on the building\ndemolition event have been evaluated against the manually marked ground-truth\nchanges and have achieved an F-1 score varying from 0.78 to 0.92, with\nconsistently high precision (0.92 - 0.99).

    "abstract": "Metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes often fabricate a near-net shape\nthat includes the as-designed part as well as the sacrificial support\nstructures that need to be machined away by subtractive manufacturing (SM), for\ninstance multi-axis machining. Thus, although AM is capable of generating\nhighly complex parts, the limitations of SM due to possible collision between\nthe milling tool and the workpiece can render an optimized part\nnon-manufacturable. We present a systematic approach to topology optimization\n(TO) of parts for AM followed by SM to ensure removability of support\nstructures, while optimizing the part's performance. A central idea is to\nexpress the producibility of the part from the near-net shape in terms of\naccessibility of every support structure point using a given set of cutting\ntool assemblies and fixturing orientations. Our approach does not impose any\nartificial constraints on geometric complexity of the part, support structures,\nmachining tools, and fixturing devices. We extend the notion of inaccessibility\nmeasure field (IMF) to support structures to identify the inaccessible points\nand capture their contributions to non-manufacturability by a continuous\nspatial field. IMF is then augmented to the sensitivity field to guide the TO\ntowards a manufacturable design. The approach enables efficient and effective\ndesign space exploration by finding nontrivial complex designs whose near-net\nshape can be 3D printed and post-processed for support removal by machining\nwith a custom set of tools and fixtures.

In this work, we propose an ER-enhanced ZSAR model inspired by\nan effective human memory technique Elaborative Rehearsal (ER), which involves\nelaborating a new concept and relating it to known concepts. Specifically, we\nexpand each action class as an Elaborative Description (ED) sentence, which is\nmore discriminative than a class name and less costly than manual-defined\nattributes. Besides directly aligning class semantics with videos, we\nincorporate objects from the video as Elaborative Concepts (EC) to improve\nvideo semantics and generalization from seen actions to unseen actions. Our\nER-enhanced ZSAR model achieves state-of-the-art results on three existing\nbenchmarks. Moreover, we propose a new ZSAR evaluation protocol on the Kinetics\ndataset to overcome limitations of current benchmarks and demonstrate the first\ncase where ZSAR performance is comparable to few-shot learning baselines on\nthis more realistic setting. We will release our codes and collected EDs at\nhttps://github.com/DeLightCMU/ElaborativeRehearsal.",

    "abstract": "Anomalous diffusion occurs at very different scales in nature, from atomic\nsystems to motions in cell organelles, biological tissues or ecology, and also\nin artificial materials, such as cement. Being able to accurately measure the\nanomalous exponent associated with a given particle trajectory, thus\ndetermining whether the particle subdiffuses, superdiffuses or performs normal\ndiffusion is of key importance to understand the diffusion process. Also, it is\noften important to trustingly identify the model behind the trajectory, as this\ngives a large amount of information on the system dynamics. Both aspects are\nparticularly difficult when the input data are short and noisy trajectories. It\nis even more difficult if one cannot guarantee that the trajectories output in\nexperiments is homogeneous, hindering the statistical methods based on\nensembles of trajectories. We present a data-driven method able to infer the\nanomalous exponent and to identify the type of anomalous diffusion process\nbehind single, noisy and short trajectories, with good accuracy. This model was\nused in our participation in the Anomalous Diffusion (AnDi) Challenge. A\ncombination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks were used to achieve\nstate-of-the-art results when compared to methods participating in the AnDi\nChallenge, ranking top 4 in both classification and diffusion exponent\nregression.",

Therefore, it is important to make use of\ninformation across time series to improve learning.

    "abstract": "Human-robot collaboration is an essential research topic in artificial\nintelligence (AI), enabling researchers to devise cognitive AI systems and\naffords an intuitive means for users to interact with the robot. Of note,\ncommunication plays a central role. To date, prior studies in embodied agent\nnavigation have only demonstrated that human languages facilitate communication\nby instructions in natural languages. Nevertheless, a plethora of other forms\nof communication is left unexplored. In fact, human communication originated in\ngestures and oftentimes is delivered through multimodal cues, e.g. \"go there\"\nwith a pointing gesture. To bridge the gap and fill in the missing dimension of\ncommunication in embodied agent navigation, we propose investigating the\neffects of using gestures as the communicative interface instead of verbal\ncues. Specifically, we develop a VR-based 3D simulation environment, named\nGes-THOR, based on AI2-THOR platform. In this virtual environment, a human\nplayer is placed in the same virtual scene and shepherds the artificial agent\nusing only gestures. The agent is tasked to solve the navigation problem guided\nby natural gestures with unknown semantics; we do not use any predefined\ngestures due to the diversity and versatile nature of human gestures. We argue\nthat learning the semantics of natural gestures is mutually beneficial to\nlearning the navigation task--learn to communicate and communicate to learn. In\na series of experiments, we demonstrate that human gesture cues, even without\npredefined semantics, improve the object-goal navigation for an embodied agent,\noutperforming various state-of-the-art methods.",

This understanding can help to inhibit virus replication, prolong\nadaptive immune response, accelerated virus clearance, and tissue recovery, a\nkey milestone to propose a vaccine to combat coronaviruses (CoVs), e.g.,\nCovid-19. Although an innate immune system triggers inflammatory responses\nagainst CoVs upon recognition of viruses, however, a vaccine is the ultimate\nprotection against CoV spread. The development of this vaccine is\ntime-consuming and requires a deep understanding of the innate immune response\nsystem. In this work, we propose a graph neural network-based model that\nexploits the interactions between pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), i.e.,\nthe human immune response system. These interactions can help to recognize\npathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to predict the activation\nrequirements of each PRR. The immune response information of each PRR is\nderived from combining its historical PAMPs activation coupled with the modeled\neffect on the same from PRRs in its neighborhood. On one hand, this work can\nhelp to understand how long Covid-19 can confer immunity where a strong immune\nresponse means people already been infected can safely return to work. On the\nother hand, this GNN-based understanding can also abode well for vaccine\ndevelopment efforts.

    "abstract": "A lifespan face synthesis (LFS) model aims to generate a set of\nphoto-realistic face images of a person's whole life, given only one snapshot\nas reference. The generated face image given a target age code is expected to\nbe age-sensitive reflected by bio-plausible transformations of shape and\ntexture, while being identity preserving. This is extremely challenging because\nthe shape and texture characteristics of a face undergo separate and highly\nnonlinear transformations w.r.t. age. Most recent LFS models are based on\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) whereby age code conditional\ntransformations are applied to a latent face representation. They benefit\ngreatly from the recent advancements of GANs. However, without explicitly\ndisentangling their latent representations into the texture, shape and identity\nfactors, they are fundamentally limited in modeling the nonlinear age-related\ntransformation on texture and shape whilst preserving identity. In this work, a\nnovel LFS model is proposed to disentangle the key face characteristics\nincluding shape, texture and identity so that the unique shape and texture age\ntransformations can be modeled effectively. This is achieved by extracting\nshape, texture and identity features separately from an encoder. Critically,\ntwo transformation modules, one conditional convolution based and the other\nchannel attention based, are designed for modeling the nonlinear shape and\ntexture feature transformations respectively. This is to accommodate their\nrather distinct aging processes and ensure that our synthesized images are both\nage-sensitive and identity preserving. Extensive experiments show that our LFS\nmodel is clearly superior to the state-of-the-art alternatives.

Using natural language processing of historical text, we found\nevidence for semantic change in emotion words over the past century and that\nvarying rates of change were predicted in part by an emotion concept's\nprototypicality - how representative it is of the broader category of\n\"emotion\". Prototypicality negatively correlated with historical rates of\nemotion semantic change obtained from text-based word embeddings, beyond more\nestablished variables including usage frequency in English and a second\ncomparison language, French. This effect for prototypicality did not\nconsistently extend to the semantic category of birds, suggesting its relevance\nfor predicting semantic change may be category-dependent. Our results suggest\nemotion semantics are evolving over time, with prototypical emotion words\nremaining semantically stable, while other emotion words evolve more freely.",

    "abstract": "We study a worst-case scenario in generalization: Out-of-domain\ngeneralization from a single source. The goal is to learn a robust model from a\nsingle source and expect it to generalize over many unknown distributions. This\nchallenging problem has been seldom investigated while existing solutions\nsuffer from various limitations such as the ignorance of uncertainty assessment\nand label augmentation. In this paper, we propose uncertainty-guided domain\ngeneralization to tackle the aforementioned limitations. The key idea is to\naugment the source capacity in both feature and label spaces, while the\naugmentation is guided by uncertainty assessment. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work to (1) quantify the generalization uncertainty from a\nsingle source and (2) leverage it to guide both feature and label augmentation\nfor robust generalization. The model training and deployment are effectively\norganized in a Bayesian meta-learning framework. We conduct extensive\ncomparisons and ablation study to validate our approach. The results prove our\nsuperior performance in a wide scope of tasks including image classification,\nsemantic segmentation, text classification, and speech recognition.",

Receiver beamforming is applied to minimize the\nmean-square-error (MSE) of the distortion of function aggregation result via\nAirComp.

    "abstract": "Transfer learning allows the reuse of deep learning features on new datasets\nwith limited data. However, the resulting models could be unnecessarily large\nand thus inefficient. Although network pruning can be applied to improve\ninference efficiency, existing algorithms usually require fine-tuning and may\nnot be suitable for small datasets. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that\ntransforms the convolutional weights into the subspaces of orthonormal bases\nwhere a model is pruned. Using singular value decomposition, we decompose a\nconvolutional layer into two layers: a convolutional layer with the orthonormal\nbasis vectors as the filters, and a layer that we name \"BasisScalingConv\",\nwhich is responsible for rescaling the features and transforming them back to\nthe original space. As the filters in each transformed layer are linearly\nindependent with known relative importance, pruning can be more effective and\nstable, and fine tuning individual weights is unnecessary. Furthermore, as the\nnumbers of input and output channels of the original convolutional layer remain\nunchanged, basis pruning is applicable to virtually all network architectures.\nBasis pruning can also be combined with existing pruning algorithms for double\npruning to further increase the pruning capability. With less than 1% reduction\nin the classification accuracy, we can achieve pruning ratios up to 98.9% in\nparameters and 98.6% in FLOPs.",

A policy designer needs to consider\nmultiple objectives, policy levers, and behavioral responses from strategic\nactors who optimize for their individual objectives. Moreover, real-world\npolicies should be explainable and robust to simulation-to-reality gaps, e.g.,\ndue to calibration issues. Existing approaches are often limited to a narrow\nset of policy levers or objectives that are hard to measure, do not yield\nexplicit optimal policies, or do not consider strategic behavior, for example.\nHence, it remains challenging to optimize policy in real-world scenarios. Here\nwe show that the AI Economist framework enables effective, flexible, and\ninterpretable policy design using two-level reinforcement learning (RL) and\ndata-driven simulations. We validate our framework on optimizing the stringency\nof US state policies and Federal subsidies during a pandemic, e.g., COVID-19,\nusing a simulation fitted to real data. We find that log-linear policies\ntrained using RL significantly improve social welfare, based on both public\nhealth and economic outcomes, compared to past outcomes.

    "abstract": "Sentence semantic matching requires an agent to determine the semantic\nrelation between two sentences, which is widely used in various natural\nlanguage tasks, such as Natural Language Inference (NLI), Paraphrase\nIdentification (PI), and so on. Much recent progress has been made in this\narea, especially attention-based methods and pre-trained language model based\nmethods. However, most of these methods focus on all the important parts in\nsentences in a static way and only emphasize how important the words are to the\nquery, inhibiting the ability of attention mechanism. In order to overcome this\nproblem and boost the performance of attention mechanism, we propose a novel\ndynamic re-read attention, which can pay close attention to one small region of\nsentences at each step and re-read the important parts for better sentence\nrepresentations. Based on this attention variation, we develop a novel Dynamic\nRe-read Network (DRr-Net) for sentence semantic matching. Moreover, selecting\none small region in dynamic re-read attention seems insufficient for sentence\nsemantics, and employing pre-trained language models as input encoders will\nintroduce incomplete and fragile representation problems. To this end, we\nextend DRrNet to Locally-Aware Dynamic Re-read Attention Net (LadRa-Net), in\nwhich local structure of sentences is employed to alleviate the shortcoming of\nByte-Pair Encoding (BPE) in pre-trained language models and boost the\nperformance of dynamic reread attention. Extensive experiments on two popular\nsentence semantic matching tasks demonstrate that DRr-Net can significantly\nimprove the performance of sentence semantic matching. Meanwhile, LadRa-Net is\nable to achieve better performance by considering the local structures of\nsentences.

To improve the capacity and reliability of the UAV networks,\nmillimeter-wave (mmWave) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be\nused in the system. In this paper, we consider an RIS-assisted mmWave UAV\nwireless cellular network, where UAVs serve several users with the help of\nmultiple RISs. We jointly optimize the deployment, user scheduling, beamforming\nvector, and RIS phases to maximize the sum-rate, with the constraints of the\nminimum rate, the UAV movement, the analog beamforming, and the RIS phases. To\nsolve this complex problem, we use an iterative method, in which when we\noptimize one variable, we fix the other three variables. When optimizing the\ndeployment, we find the optimal position for the UAV by a sphere search. Then,\nwe formulate a mixed-integer non-linear problem (MINLP) to find the best\nscheduling. A spatial branch-and-bound (sBnB) method is used to solve the\nMINLP. When Optimizing the beamforming vector and the RIS phases, we propose an\niterative algorithm that relies on the equivalence between the maximization of\nthe sum-rate and the minimization of the summation of weighted mean-square\nerrors (sum-WMMSE). The majority-minimization method is used to deal with the\nconstant-modulus constraints for the analog beamforming and RIS phases. The\nproposed joint optimization offers significant advantages over the system\nwithout beamforming and RIS phase optimization and the system without\ndeployment optimization.

Due to the complexity of content and layout in\nVRDs, structured text understanding has been a challenging task. Most existing\nstudies decoupled this problem into two sub-tasks: entity labeling and entity\nlinking, which require an entire understanding of the context of documents at\nboth token and segment levels. However, little work has been concerned with the\nsolutions that efficiently extract the structured data from different levels.\nThis paper proposes a unified framework named StrucTexT, which is flexible and\neffective for handling both sub-tasks. Specifically, based on the transformer,\nwe introduce a segment-token aligned encoder to deal with the entity labeling\nand entity linking tasks at different levels of granularity.

    "abstract": "While image understanding on recognition-level has achieved remarkable\nadvancements, reliable visual scene understanding requires comprehensive image\nunderstanding on recognition-level but also cognition-level, which calls for\nexploiting the multi-source information as well as learning different levels of\nunderstanding and extensive commonsense knowledge. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Cognitive Attention Network (CAN) for visual commonsense reasoning to\nachieve interpretable visual understanding. Specifically, we first introduce an\nimage-text fusion module to fuse information from images and text collectively.\nSecond, a novel inference module is designed to encode commonsense among image,\nquery and response.

    "abstract": "Image Retrieval is a fundamental task of obtaining images similar to the\nquery one from a database. A common image retrieval practice is to firstly\nretrieve candidate images via similarity search using global image features and\nthen re-rank the candidates by leveraging their local features. Previous\nlearning-based studies mainly focus on either global or local image\nrepresentation learning to tackle the retrieval task. In this paper, we abandon\nthe two-stage paradigm and seek to design an effective single-stage solution by\nintegrating local and global information inside images into compact image\nrepresentations. Specifically, we propose a Deep Orthogonal Local and Global\n(DOLG) information fusion framework for end-to-end image retrieval. It\nattentively extracts representative local information with multi-atrous\nconvolutions and self-attention at first. Components orthogonal to the global\nimage representation are then extracted from the local information. At last,\nthe orthogonal components are concatenated with the global representation as a\ncomplementary, and then aggregation is performed to generate the final\nrepresentation. The whole framework is end-to-end differentiable and can be\ntrained with image-level labels. Extensive experimental results validate the\neffectiveness of our solution and show that our model achieves state-of-the-art\nimage retrieval performances on Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.",

    "abstract": "Flying robots such as the quadrotor could provide an efficient approach for\nmedical treatment or sensor placing of wild animals. In these applications,\ncontinuously targeting the moving animal is a crucial requirement. Due to the\nunderactuated characteristics of the quadrotor and the coupled kinematics with\nthe animal, nonlinear optimal tracking approaches, other than smooth feedback\ncontrol, are required. However, with severe nonlinearities, it would be\ntime-consuming to evaluate control inputs, and real-time tracking may not be\nachieved with generic optimizers onboard. To tackle this problem, a novel\nefficient egocentric regulation approach with high computational efficiency is\nproposed in this paper. Specifically, it directly formulates the optimal\ntracking problem in an egocentric manner regarding the quadrotor's body\ncoordinates. Meanwhile, the nonlinearities of the system are peeled off through\na mapping of the feedback states as well as control inputs, between the\ninertial and body coordinates. In this way, the proposed efficient egocentric\nregulator only requires solving a quadratic performance objective with linear\nconstraints and then generate control inputs analytically. Comparative\nsimulations and mimic biological experiment are carried out to verify the\neffectiveness and computational efficiency. Results demonstrate that the\nproposed control approach presents the highest and stablest computational\nefficiency than generic optimizers on different platforms. Particularly, on a\ncommonly utilized onboard computer, our method can compute the control action\nin approximately 0.3 ms, which is on the order of 350 times faster than that of\ngeneric nonlinear optimizers, establishing a control frequency around 3000 Hz.",

To address this issue, we propose a novel\nimage dehazing framework collaborating with unlabeled real data.

Then a\ndisentangled-consistency mean-teacher network (DMT-Net) is employed to\ncollaborate unlabeled real data for boosting single image dehazing.\nSpecifically, we encourage the coarse predictions and refinements of each\ndisentangled component to be consistent between the student and teacher\nnetworks by using a consistency loss on unlabeled real data. We make comparison\nwith 13 state-of-the-art dehazing methods on a new collected dataset (Haze4K)\nand two widely-used dehazing datasets (i.e., SOTS and HazeRD), as well as on\nreal-world hazy images.

To monitor the condition of the link\nwhether it is connected or broken, a mechanism called link-monitoring is used.\nThe monitoring link used in this final project is Media Independent Interface\n(MII). The test step is to implement a Bonding Interface network for the use of\nvideo streaming, VoIP, and file transfer.

    "abstract": "In recent years, many deep learning models have been adopted in autonomous\ndriving. At the same time, these models introduce new vulnerabilities that may\ncompromise the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, recent studies have\ndemonstrated that adversarial attacks can cause a significant decline in\ndetection precision of deep learning-based 3D object detection models. Although\ndriving safety is the ultimate concern for autonomous driving, there is no\ncomprehensive study on the linkage between the performance of deep learning\nmodels and the driving safety of autonomous vehicles under adversarial attacks.\nIn this paper, we investigate the impact of two primary types of adversarial\nattacks, perturbation attacks and patch attacks, on the driving safety of\nvision-based autonomous vehicles rather than the detection precision of deep\nlearning models. In particular, we consider two state-of-the-art models in\nvision-based 3D object detection, Stereo R-CNN and DSGN. To evaluate driving\nsafety, we propose an end-to-end evaluation framework with a set of driving\nsafety performance metrics. By analyzing the results of our extensive\nevaluation experiments, we find that (1) the attack's impact on the driving\nsafety of autonomous vehicles and the attack's impact on the precision of 3D\nobject detectors are decoupled, and (2) the DSGN model demonstrates stronger\nrobustness to adversarial attacks than the Stereo R-CNN model. In addition, we\nfurther investigate the causes behind the two findings with an ablation study.\nThe findings of this paper provide a new perspective to evaluate adversarial\nattacks and guide the selection of deep learning models in autonomous driving.",

An\nindispensable part of the health diet is dietary assessment. Traditional manual\nrecording methods are burdensome and contain substantial biases and errors.\nRecent advances in Artificial Intelligence, especially computer vision\ntechnologies, have made it possible to develop automatic dietary assessment\nsolutions, which are more convenient, less time-consuming and even more\naccurate to monitor daily food intake.\nScope and approach: This review presents one unified Vision-Based Dietary\nAssessment (VBDA) framework, which generally consists of three stages: food\nimage analysis, volume estimation and nutrient derivation. Vision-based food\nanalysis methods, including food recognition, detection and segmentation, are\nsystematically summarized, and methods of volume estimation and nutrient\nderivation are also given. The prosperity of deep learning makes VBDA gradually\nmove to an end-to-end implementation, which applies food images to a single\nnetwork to directly estimate the nutrition. The recently proposed end-to-end\nmethods are also discussed. We further analyze existing dietary assessment\ndatasets, indicating that one large-scale benchmark is urgently needed, and\nfinally highlight key challenges and future trends for VBDA.\nKey findings and conclusions: After thorough exploration, we find that\nmulti-task end-to-end deep learning approaches are one important trend of VBDA.\nDespite considerable research progress, many challenges remain for VBDA due to\nthe meal complexity. We also provide the latest ideas for future development of\nVBDA, e.g., fine-grained food analysis and accurate volume estimation.

The\nadvancement of AMCL is originated from three novel techniques which control the\nframework from different directions: 1) the concept of auxiliary class to\nprovide more distinct information through the labels, 2) the strategy, named\nmemory-based assignment, to determine the association between the inputs and\nthe models, and 3) the feature fusion module to achieve generalized features.\nTo demonstrate the performance of our method compared to all variants of MCL\nmethods, we conduct extensive experiments on the image classification and\nsegmentation tasks. Overall, the performance of AMCL exceeds all others in most\nof the public datasets trained with various networks as members of the\nensembles.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a valuable setting called few-shot unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (FS-UDA), which has not been sufficiently studied in the\nliterature. In this setting, the source domain data are labelled, but with\nfew-shot per category, while the target domain data are unlabelled. To address\nthe FS-UDA setting, we develop a general UDA model to solve the following two\nkey issues: the few-shot labeled data per category and the domain adaptation\nbetween support and query sets. Our model is general in that once trained it\nwill be able to be applied to various FS-UDA tasks from the same source and\ntarget domains. Inspired by the recent local descriptor based few-shot learning\n(FSL), our general UDA model is fully built upon local descriptors (LDs) for\nimage classification and domain adaptation. By proposing a novel concept called\nsimilarity patterns (SPs), our model not only effectively considers the spatial\nrelationship of LDs that was ignored in previous FSL methods, but also makes\nthe learned image similarity better serve the required domain alignment.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel IMage-to-class sparse Similarity Encoding\n(IMSE) method. It learns SPs to extract the local discriminative information\nfor classification and meanwhile aligns the covariance matrix of the SPs for\ndomain adaptation. Also, domain adversarial training and multi-scale local\nfeature matching are performed upon LDs. Extensive experiments conducted on a\nmulti-domain benchmark dataset DomainNet demonstrates the state-of-the-art\nperformance of our IMSE for the novel setting of FS-UDA. In addition, for FSL,\nour IMSE can also show better performance than most of recent FSL methods on\nminiImageNet.",

This foils the original LSP decoupling\ngoal, because the move towards a new IDE requires yet another re-implementation\nof the ad-hoc LSP extension.

    "abstract": "Labeling is onerous for crowd counting as it should annotate each individual\nin crowd images. Recently, several methods have been proposed for\nsemi-supervised crowd counting to reduce the labeling efforts. Given a limited\nlabeling budget, they typically select a few crowd images and densely label all\nindividuals in each of them. Despite the promising results, we argue the\nNone-or-All labeling strategy is suboptimal as the densely labeled individuals\nin each crowd image usually appear similar while the massive unlabeled crowd\nimages may contain entirely diverse individuals. To this end, we propose to\nbreak the labeling chain of previous methods and make the first attempt to\nreduce spatial labeling redundancy for semi-supervised crowd counting. First,\ninstead of annotating all the regions in each crowd image, we propose to\nannotate the representative ones only. We analyze the region representativeness\nfrom both vertical and horizontal directions, and formulate them as cluster\ncenters of Gaussian Mixture Models. Additionally, to leverage the rich\nunlabeled regions, we exploit the similarities among individuals in each crowd\nimage to directly supervise the unlabeled regions via feature propagation\ninstead of the error-prone label propagation employed in the previous methods.\nIn this way, we can transfer the original spatial labeling redundancy caused by\nindividual similarities to effective supervision signals on the unlabeled\nregions. Extensive experiments on the widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that\nour method can outperform previous best approaches by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "Multiview registration is used to estimate Rigid Body Transformations (RBTs)\nfrom multiple frames and reconstruct a scene with corresponding scans. Despite\nthe success of pairwise registration and pose synchronization, the concept of\nBundle Adjustment (BA) has been proven to better maintain global consistency.\nSo in this work, we make the multiview point-cloud registration more tractable\nfrom a different perspective in resolving range-based BA. Based on this\nanalysis, we propose an objective function that takes both measurement noises\nand computational cost into account. For the feature parameter update, instead\nof calculating the global distribution parameters from the raw measurements, we\naggregate the local distributions upon the pose update at each iteration. The\ncomputational cost of feature update is then only dependent on the number of\nscans. Finally, we develop a multiview registration system using voxel-based\nquantization that can be applied in real-world scenarios. The experimental\nresults demonstrate our superiority over the baselines in terms of both\naccuracy and speed. Moreover, the results also show that our average\npositioning errors achieve the centimeter level.",

    "title": "Fine-grained Domain Adaptive Crowd Counting via Point-derived  Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Existing domain adaptation methods for crowd counting view each crowd image\nas a whole and reduce domain discrepancies on crowds and backgrounds\nsimultaneously. However, we argue that these methods are suboptimal, as crowds\nand backgrounds have quite different characteristics and backgrounds may vary\ndramatically in different crowd scenes (see Fig.~\\ref{teaser}). This makes\ncrowds not well aligned across domains together with backgrounds in a holistic\nmanner. To this end, we propose to untangle crowds and backgrounds from crowd\nimages and design fine-grained domain adaption methods for crowd counting.\nDifferent from other tasks which possess region-based fine-grained annotations\n(e.g., segments or bounding boxes), crowd counting only annotates one point on\neach human head, which impedes the implementation of fine-grained adaptation\nmethods. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective schema to learn\ncrowd segmentation from point-level crowd counting annotations in the context\nof Multiple Instance Learning. We further leverage the derived segments to\npropose a crowd-aware fine-grained domain adaptation framework for crowd\ncounting, which consists of two novel adaptation modules, i.e., Crowd Region\nTransfer (CRT) and Crowd Density Alignment (CDA). Specifically, the CRT module\nis designed to guide crowd features transfer across domains beyond background\ndistractions, and the CDA module dedicates to constraining the target-domain\ncrowd density distributions. Extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain\nsettings (i.e., Synthetic $\\rightarrow$ Real, Fixed $\\rightarrow$ Fickle,\nNormal $\\rightarrow$ BadWeather) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\nmethod compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning, which aims at minimizing the distance between positive\npairs while maximizing that of negative ones, has been widely and successfully\napplied in unsupervised feature learning, where the design of positive and\nnegative (pos/neg) pairs is one of its keys. In this paper, we attempt to\ndevise a feature-level data manipulation, differing from data augmentation, to\nenhance the generic contrastive self-supervised learning. To this end, we first\ndesign a visualization scheme for pos/neg score (Pos/neg score indicates cosine\nsimilarity of pos/neg pair.) distribution, which enables us to analyze,\ninterpret and understand the learning process. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst attempt of its kind. More importantly, leveraging this tool, we gain some\nsignificant observations, which inspire our novel Feature Transformation\nproposals including the extrapolation of positives. This operation creates\nharder positives to boost the learning because hard positives enable the model\nto be more view-invariant. Besides, we propose the interpolation among\nnegatives, which provides diversified negatives and makes the model more\ndiscriminative. It is the first attempt to deal with both challenges\nsimultaneously. Experiment results show that our proposed Feature\nTransformation can improve at least 6.0% accuracy on ImageNet-100 over MoCo\nbaseline, and about 2.0% accuracy on ImageNet-1K over the MoCoV2 baseline.\nTransferring to the downstream tasks successfully demonstrate our model is less\ntask-bias.

    "abstract": "Recall the classical text generation works, the generation framework can be\nbriefly divided into two phases: \\textbf{idea reasoning} and \\textbf{surface\nrealization}. The target of idea reasoning is to figure out the main idea which\nwill be presented in the following talking/writing periods. Surface realization\naims to arrange the most appropriate sentence to depict and convey the\ninformation distilled from the main idea. However, the current popular\ntoken-by-token text generation methods ignore this crucial process and suffer\nfrom many serious issues, such as idea/topic drift. To tackle the problems and\nrealize this two-phase paradigm, we propose a new framework named Sentence\nSemantic Regression (\\textbf{SSR}) based on sentence-level language modeling.\nFor idea reasoning, two architectures \\textbf{SSR-AR} and \\textbf{SSR-NonAR}\nare designed to conduct sentence semantic regression autoregressively (like\nGPT2/3) and bidirectionally (like BERT). In the phase of surface realization, a\nmixed-granularity sentence decoder is designed to generate text with better\nconsistency by jointly incorporating the predicted sentence-level main idea as\nwell as the preceding contextual token-level information. We conduct\nexperiments on four tasks of story ending prediction, story ending generation,\ndialogue generation, and sentence infilling.

The new formulations are based on\nthe observation that the FTR fading distribution can be expressed in terms of a\nfinite continuous mixture of simpler distributions, also popular in the context\nof wireless channel modeling. In the general case with arbitrary $m$, the FTR\nfading model is described as an underlying Rician Shadowed (RS) distribution\nwith continuously varying parameter $K$; hence, the chief statistics of the FTR\nfading model are expressed in terms of a finite-range integral over the\nequivalent RS statistic. In the special case of integer $m$, the FTR fading\nmodel is described in terms of a finite number of underlying squared\nNakagami-$m$ distributions; again, the chief statistics of the FTR fading model\nare expressed in terms of a number of finite-range integrals over the\nequivalent Nakagami-$m$ statistic. In all instances, previous existing results\nin the literature for those simpler distributions can be extended to the case\nof FTR fading.

It has then been extended to\naddress 3D imaging using either stacks of 2D sampling patterns or a local 3D\nstrategy that optimizes a single sampling trajectory at a time. 2D SPARKLING\nactually performs variable density sampling (VDS) along a prescribed target\ndensity while maximizing sampling efficiency and meeting the gradient-based\nhardware constraints. However, 3D SPARKLING has remained limited in terms of\nacceleration factors along the third dimension if one wants to preserve a peaky\npoint spread function (PSF) and thus good image quality.In this paper, in order\nto achieve higher acceleration factors in 3D imaging while preserving image\nquality, we propose a new efficient algorithm that performs optimization on\nfull 3D SPARKLING. The proposed implementation based on fast multipole methods\n(FMM) allows us to design sampling patterns with up to 10^7 k-space samples,\nthus opening the door to 3D VDS. We compare multi-CPU and GPU implementations\nand demonstrate that the latter is optimal for 3D imaging in the\nhigh-resolution acquisition regime (600$\\mu$m isotropic). Finally, we show that\nthis novel optimization for full 3D SPARKLING outperforms stacking strategies\nor 3D twisted projection imaging through retrospective and prospective studies\non NIST phantom and in vivo brain scans at 3 Tesla.

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of medical images is an essential first step in\ncomputer-aided diagnosis systems for many applications. However, given many\ndisparate imaging modalities and inherent variations in the patient data, it is\ndifficult to consistently achieve high accuracy using modern deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs). This has led researchers to propose interactive image\nsegmentation techniques where a medical expert can interactively correct the\noutput of a DNN to the desired accuracy. However, these techniques often need\nseparate training data with the associated human interactions, and do not\ngeneralize to various diseases, and types of medical images. In this paper, we\nsuggest a novel conditional inference technique for DNNs which takes the\nintervention by a medical expert as test time constraints and performs\ninference conditioned upon these constraints. Our technique is generic can be\nused for medical images from any modality. Unlike other methods, our approach\ncan correct multiple structures simultaneously and add structures missed at\ninitial segmentation. We report an improvement of 13.3, 12.5, 17.8, 10.2, and\n12.4 times in user annotation time than full human annotation for the nucleus,\nmultiple cells, liver and tumor, organ, and brain segmentation respectively. We\nreport a time saving of 2.8, 3.0, 1.9, 4.4, and 8.6 fold compared to other\ninteractive segmentation techniques.

Aortic diseases,\nlike aneurysms or dissections, can lead to an aortic rupture, whose treatment\nwith open surgery is highly risky. Therefore, patients commonly undergo drug\ntreatment under constant monitoring, which requires regular inspections of the\nvessels through imaging. The standard imaging modality for diagnosis and\nmonitoring is computed tomography (CT), which can provide a detailed picture of\nthe aorta and its branching vessels if combined with a contrast agent,\nresulting in a CT angiography (CTA). Optimally, the whole aortic vessel tree\ngeometry from consecutive CTAs, are overlaid and compared.

In this paper, we systematically review computing techniques for\nthe automatic and semi-automatic segmentation of the aortic vessel tree.

    "abstract": "With autonomous driving developing in a booming stage, accurate object\ndetection in complex scenarios attract wide attention to ensure the safety of\nautonomous driving. Millimeter wave (mmWave) radar and vision fusion is a\nmainstream solution for accurate obstacle detection. This article presents a\ndetailed survey on mmWave radar and vision fusion based obstacle detection\nmethods. Firstly, we introduce the tasks, evaluation criteria and datasets of\nobject detection for autonomous driving. Then, the process of mmWave radar and\nvision fusion is divided into three parts: sensor deployment, sensor\ncalibration and sensor fusion, which are reviewed comprehensively. Especially,\nwe classify the fusion methods into data level, decision level and feature\nlevel fusion methods. Besides, we introduce the fusion of lidar and vision in\nautonomous driving in the aspects of obstacle detection, object classification\nand road segmentation, which is promising in the future. Finally, we summarize\nthis article.",

Explainability has been identified\nas a means to achieve these qualities. It is recognized as an emerging\nnon-functional requirement (NFR) that has a significant impact on system\nquality. However, in order to incorporate this NFR into systems, we need to\nunderstand what explainability means from a software engineering perspective\nand how it impacts other quality aspects in a system. This allows for an early\nanalysis of the benefits and possible design issues that arise from\ninterrelationships between different quality aspects. Nevertheless,\nexplainability is currently under-researched in the domain of requirements\nengineering and there is a lack of conceptual models and knowledge catalogues\nthat support the requirements engineering process and system design. In this\nwork, we bridge this gap by proposing a definition, a model, and a catalogue\nfor explainability.

    "abstract": "The need of predictive maintenance comes with an increasing number of\nincidents reported by monitoring systems and equipment/software users. In the\nfront line, on-call engineers (OCEs) have to quickly assess the degree of\nseverity of an incident and decide which service to contact for corrective\nactions. To automate these decisions, several predictive models have been\nproposed, but the most efficient models are opaque (say, black box), strongly\nlimiting their adoption. In this paper, we propose an efficient black box model\nbased on 170K incidents reported to our company over the last 7 years and\nemphasize on the need of automating triage when incidents are massively\nreported on thousands of servers running our product, an ERP. Recent\ndevelopments in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) help in providing\nglobal explanations to the model, but also, and most importantly, with local\nexplanations for each model prediction/outcome. Sadly, providing a human with\nan explanation for each outcome is not conceivable when dealing with an\nimportant number of daily predictions. To address this problem, we propose an\noriginal data-mining method rooted in Subgroup Discovery, a pattern mining\ntechnique with the natural ability to group objects that share similar\nexplanations of their black box predictions and provide a description for each\ngroup. We evaluate this approach and present our preliminary results which give\nus good hope towards an effective OCE's adoption. We believe that this approach\nprovides a new way to address the problem of model agnostic outcome\nexplanation.",

    "abstract": "Extending the popular Answer Set Programming (ASP) paradigm by introspective\nreasoning capacities has received increasing interest within the last years.\nParticular attention is given to the formalism of epistemic logic programs\n(ELPs) where standard rules are equipped with modal operators which allow to\nexpress conditions on literals for being known or possible, i.e., contained in\nall or some answer sets, respectively. ELPs thus deliver multiple collections\nof answer sets, known as world views. Employing ELPs for reasoning problems so\nfar has mainly been restricted to standard decision problems (complexity\nanalysis) and enumeration (development of systems) of world views. In this\npaper, we take a next step and contribute to epistemic logic programming in two\nways: First, we establish quantitative reasoning for ELPs, where the acceptance\nof a certain set of literals depends on the number (proportion) of world views\nthat are compatible with the set. Second, we present a novel system that is\ncapable of efficiently solving the underlying counting problems required to\nanswer such quantitative reasoning problems. Our system exploits the\ngraph-based measure treewidth and works by iteratively finding and refining\n(graph) abstractions of an ELP program. On top of these abstractions, we apply\ndynamic programming that is combined with utilizing existing search-based\nsolvers like (e)clingo for hard combinatorial subproblems that appear during\nsolving. It turns out that our approach is competitive with existing systems\nthat were introduced recently. This work is under consideration for acceptance\nin TPLP.",

    "abstract": "A few-shot semantic segmentation model is typically composed of a CNN\nencoder, a CNN decoder and a simple classifier (separating foreground and\nbackground pixels). Most existing methods meta-learn all three model components\nfor fast adaptation to a new class. However, given that as few as a single\nsupport set image is available, effective model adaption of all three\ncomponents to the new class is extremely challenging. In this work we propose\nto simplify the meta-learning task by focusing solely on the simplest\ncomponent, the classifier, whilst leaving the encoder and decoder to\npre-training. We hypothesize that if we pre-train an off-the-shelf segmentation\nmodel over a set of diverse training classes with sufficient annotations, the\nencoder and decoder can capture rich discriminative features applicable for any\nunseen classes, rendering the subsequent meta-learning stage unnecessary. For\nthe classifier meta-learning, we introduce a Classifier Weight Transformer\n(CWT) designed to dynamically adapt the supportset trained classifier's weights\nto each query image in an inductive way. Extensive experiments on two standard\nbenchmarks show that despite its simplicity, our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art alternatives, often by a large margin.Code is available on\nhttps://github.com/zhiheLu/CWTfor-FSS.",

    "abstract": "Modern communication devices are often equipped with multiple wireless\ncommunication interfaces with diverse characteristics. This enables exploiting\na form of multi-connectivity known as interface diversity to provide path\ndiversity with multiple communication interfaces. Interface diversity helps to\ncombat the problems suffered by single-interface systems due to error bursts in\nthe link, which are a consequence of temporal correlation in the wireless\nchannel. The length of an error burst is an essential performance indicator for\ncyber-physical control applications with periodic traffic, as these define the\nperiod in which the control link is unavailable. However, the available\ninterfaces must be correctly orchestrated to achieve an adequate trade-off\nbetween latency, reliability, and energy consumption. This work investigates\nhow the packet error statistics from different interfaces impacts the overall\nlatency-reliability characteristics and explores mechanisms to derive adequate\ninterface diversity policies. For this, we model the optimization problem as a\npartially observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where the state of each\ninterface is determined by a Gilbert-Elliott model whose parameters are\nestimated based on experimental measurement traces from LTE and Wi-Fi. Our\nresults show that the POMDP approach provides an all-round adaptable solution,\nwhose performance is only 0.1% below the absolute upper bound, dictated by the\noptimal policy under the impractical assumption of full observability.",

The proposed technique\nhas been implemented into a visualization system called Sequence Cluster\nExplorer (Sequen-C) that allows multilevel and detail-on-demand exploration\nthrough three coordinated views, and the inspection of data attributes at\ncluster, unique sequence, and individual sequence level. We present two case\nstudies using real-world datasets in the healthcare domain: CUREd and\nMIMIC-III; which demonstrate how the technique can aid users to obtain a\nsummary of common and deviating pathways, and explore data attributes for\nselected patterns.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven material design has been attracting great\nattentions as a groundbreaking technology across a wide spectrum of industries.\nMolecular design is particularly important owing to its broad application\ndomains and boundless creativity attributed to progresses in generative models.\nThe recent maturity of molecular generative models has stimulated expectations\nfor practical use among potential users, who are not necessarily familiar with\ncoding or scripting, such as experimental engineers and students in chemical\ndomains. However, most of the existing molecular generative models are Python\nlibraries on GitHub, that are accessible for only IT-savvy users. To fill this\ngap, we newly developed a graphical user interface (GUI)-based web application\nof molecular generative models, Molecule Generation Experience, that is open to\nthe general public. This is the first web application of molecular generative\nmodels enabling users to work with built-in datasets to carry out molecular\ndesign. In this paper, we describe the background technology extended from our\nprevious work. Our new online evaluation and structural filtering algorithms\nsignificantly improved the generation speed by 30 to 1,000 times with a wider\nstructural variety, satisfying chemical stability and synthetic reality. We\nalso describe in detail our Kubernetes-based scalable cloud architecture and\nuser-oriented GUI that are necessary components to achieve a public service.\nFinally, we present actual use cases in industrial research to design new\nphotoacid generators (PAGs) as well as release cases in educational events.",

Delivery robots\nare getting common, and they share the sidewalk along with the pedestrians.\nCurrent research has explored the design of eHMI and its effectiveness for\nsocial robots and autonomous vehicles, but the use of eHMIs on delivery robots\nstill remains unexplored. There is a knowledge gap on the effective use of\neHMIs on delivery robots for indicating the robot's navigational intent to the\npedestrians. An online survey with 152 participants was conducted to\ninvestigate the comprehensibility of the display and light-based eHMIs that\nconvey the delivery robot's navigational intent under common navigation\nscenarios. Results show that display is preferred over lights in conveying the\nintent. The preferred type of content to be displayed varies according to the\nscenarios.

    "abstract": "Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) are directed graphs that represent all possible\nwalks a program can take during its execution. CFGs are used to analyze\ncomputer programs for purposes such as compilation, performance, and security.\nThey are commonly drawn using hierarchical layouts. However, the general nature\nof such layouts may not capture CFG-specific structures, making it more\ndifficult to match the drawing to the domain. Domain-specific drawings often\nrequire the help of a graph drawing expert, despite the computing expertise of\nthe target audience. To alleviate these issues, we conduct a survey of drawing\nconventions and needs for CFGs. We then, through an iterative design process,\ndesign a flexible set of representations based on these findings and develop\nCFGConf, a JSON specification for specifying and drawing these higher-level\ndrawing requirements, thereby allowing users to generate and integrate their\nown CFG-aware graph drawings. The CFGConf language enables the creation of\ndomain-aware graph drawings of CFGs by increasing the notational efficiency of\nspecifying the requirements while also retaining the expressiveness found in\ncommonly used systems such as dot/graphviz. We evaluate CFGConf in terms of\nnotational efficiency, expressiveness, and accessibility through user study and\nillustrative examples.",

The real-time analysis of posts on\nsuch platforms can reveal valuable and timely insights for journalists,\npoliticians, business analysts, and first responders, but the high number and\ndiversity of new posts pose a challenge. In this work, we present an\ninteractive system that enables the visual analysis of streaming social media\ndata on a large scale in real-time.

In contrast to previous work, our system also works with non-geolocated\nposts and avoids extensive preprocessing such as detecting events.

    "abstract": "Recent theoretical and experimental advances show that the inertia of\nmagnetization emerges at sub-picoseconds and contributes to the ultrafast\nmagnetization dynamics which cannot be captured intrinsically by the LLG\nequation. Therefore, as a generalization, the inertial Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert\n(iLLG) equation is proposed to model the ultrafast magnetization dynamics.\nMathematically, the LLG equation is a nonlinear system of parabolic type with\n(possible) degeneracy. However, the iLLG equation is a nonlinear system of\nmixed hyperbolic-parabolic type with degeneracy, and exhibits more complicated\nstructures. It behaves like a hyperbolic system at the sub-picosecond scale\nwhile behaves like a parabolic system at larger timescales. Such hybrid\nbehaviors impose additional difficulties on designing numerical methods for the\niLLG equation. In this work, we propose a second-order semi-implicit scheme to\nsolve the iLLG equation. The second temporal derivative of magnetization is\napproximated by the standard centered difference scheme and the first\nderivative is approximated by the midpoint scheme involving three time steps.\nThe nonlinear terms are treated semi-implicitly using one-sided interpolation\nwith the second-order accuracy. At each step, the unconditionally unique\nsolvability of the unsymmetric linear system of equations in the proposed\nmethod is proved with a detailed discussion on the condition number.\nNumerically, the second-order accuracy in both time and space is verified.\nUsing the proposed method, the inertial effect of ferromagnetics is observed in\nmicromagnetics simulations at small timescales, in consistency with the\nhyperbolic property of the model at sub-picoseconds. For long time simulations,\nthe results of the iLLG model are in nice agreements with those of the LLG\nmodel, in consistency with the parabolic feature of the iLLG model at larger\ntimescales.",

Consequently, besides enjoying\nthe virtues of k-means such as simplicity and scalability to large data sets,\nEulerK is also robust to noises and outliers. Although so, the centroids\ncaptured by EulerK deviate from the unit hyper-sphere surface and thus in\nstrict distributional sense, actually are outliers.

To eliminate the deviation, we propose two Rectified Euler k-means\nmethods, i.e., REK1 and REK2, which retain the merits of EulerK while acquire\nreal centroids residing on the mapped space to better characterize the data\nstructures. Specifically, REK1 rectifies EulerK by imposing the constraint on\nthe centroids while REK2 views each centroid as the mapped image from a\npre-image in the original space and optimizes these pre-images in Euler kernel\ninduced space.

The goal is to design a policy that minimizes\nthe Bayes risk which balances between the sample complexity, detection errors,\nand the switching cost associated with switching across processes. We develop a\npolicy, dubbed consecutive controlled sensing (CCS), to achieve this goal. On\nthe one hand, by contrast to existing studies on controlled sensing, the CCS\npolicy senses processes consecutively to reduce the switching cost. On the\nother hand, the policy controls the sensing operation in a closed-loop manner\nto switch between processes when necessary to guarantee reliable inference.

For this, we outline a\nconstruction strategy that aligns messages in different languages at both the\nnode and semantic levels.

    "title": "Detecting Requirements Smells With Deep Learning: Experiences,  Challenges and Future Work",
    "abstract": "Requirements Engineering (RE) is the initial step towards building a software\nsystem. The success or failure of a software project is firmly tied to this\nphase, based on communication among stakeholders using natural language. The\nproblem with natural language is that it can easily lead to different\nunderstandings if it is not expressed precisely by the stakeholders involved,\nwhich results in building a product different from the expected one. Previous\nwork proposed to enhance the quality of the software requirements detecting\nlanguage errors based on ISO 29148 requirements language criteria. The existing\nsolutions apply classical Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect them. NLP\nhas some limitations, such as domain dependability which results in poor\ngeneralization capability. Therefore, this work aims to improve the previous\nwork by creating a manually labeled dataset and using ensemble learning, Deep\nLearning (DL), and techniques such as word embeddings and transfer learning to\novercome the generalization problem that is tied with classical NLP and improve\nprecision and recall metrics using a manually labeled dataset. The current\nfindings show that the dataset is unbalanced and which class examples should be\nadded more. It is tempting to train algorithms even if the dataset is not\nconsiderably representative. Whence, the results show that models are\noverfitting; in Machine Learning this issue is solved by adding more instances\nto the dataset, improving label quality, removing noise, and reducing the\nlearning algorithms complexity, which is planned for this research.",

To this end, Pearl's celebrated do-calculus provides a set\nof inference rules to derive an interventional probability from an\nobservational one. In this framework, the primitive causal relations are\nencoded as functional dependencies in a Structural Causal Model (SCM), which\nare generally mapped into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in the absence of\ncycles. In this paper, by contrast, we capture causality without reference to\ngraphs or functional dependencies, but with information fields and\nWitsenhausen's intrinsic model. The three rules of do-calculus reduce to a\nunique sufficient condition for conditional independence, the topological\nseparation, which presents interesting theoretical and practical advantages\nover the d-separation. With this unique rule, we can deal with systems that\ncannot be represented with DAGs, for instance systems with cycles and/or\n'spurious' edges.

    "title": "Reasoning on Multi-Relational Contextual Hierarchies via Answer Set  Programming with Algebraic Measures",
    "abstract": "Dealing with context dependent knowledge has led to different formalizations\nof the notion of context. Among them is the Contextualized Knowledge Repository\n(CKR) framework, which is rooted in description logics but links on the\nreasoning side strongly to logic programs and Answer Set Programming (ASP) in\nparticular. The CKR framework caters for reasoning with defeasible axioms and\nexceptions in contexts, which was extended to knowledge inheritance across\ncontexts in a coverage (specificity) hierarchy. However, the approach supports\nonly this single type of contextual relation and the reasoning procedures work\nonly for restricted hierarchies, due to non-trivial issues with model\npreference under exceptions. In this paper, we overcome these limitations and\npresent a generalization of CKR hierarchies to multiple contextual relations,\nalong with their interpretation of defeasible axioms and preference. To support\nreasoning, we use ASP with algebraic measures, which is a recent extension of\nASP with weighted formulas over semirings that allows one to associate\nquantities with interpretations depending on the truth values of propositional\natoms. Notably, we show that for a relevant fragment of CKR hierarchies with\nmultiple contextual relations, query answering can be realized with the popular\nasprin framework. The algebraic measures approach is more powerful and enables\ne.g. reasoning with epistemic queries over CKRs, which opens interesting\nperspectives for the use of quantitative ASP extensions in other applications.\nUnder consideration for acceptance in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming\n(TPLP).",

Whether we are selecting from a\nset of visualizations, commissioning someone to produce them, or creating them\nourselves, an effective way of specifying intent can help guide this process.\nIdeally, we would have a concise and shared specification language. In previous\nwork, we have argued that communicative intents can be viewed as a\nlearning/assessment problem (i.e., what should the reader learn and what test\nshould they do well on). Learning-based specification formats are linked (e.g.,\nassessments are derived from objectives) but some may more effectively specify\ncommunicative intent. Through a large-scale experiment, we studied three\nspecification types: learning objectives, insights, and assessments.\nParticipants, guided by one of these specifications, rated their preferences\nfor a set of visualization designs. Then, we evaluated the set of visualization\ndesigns to assess which specification led participants to prefer the most\neffective visualizations. We find that while all specification types have\nbenefits over no-specification, each format has its own advantages.

    "abstract": "Rotating object detection has wide applications in aerial photographs, remote\nsensing images, UAVs, etc. At present, most of the rotating object detection\ndatasets focus on the field of remote sensing, and these images are usually\nshot in high-altitude scenes. However, image datasets captured at low-altitude\nareas also should be concerned, such as drone-based datasets. So we present a\nlow-altitude dronebased dataset, named UAV-ROD, aiming to promote the research\nand development in rotating object detection and UAV applications. The UAV-ROD\nconsists of 1577 images and 30,090 instances of car category annotated by\noriented bounding boxes. In particular, The UAV-ROD can be utilized for the\nrotating object detection, vehicle orientation recognition and object counting\ntasks. Compared with horizontal object detection, the regression stage of the\nrotation detection is a tricky problem. In this paper, we propose a rotating\nobject detector TS4Net, which contains anchor refinement module (ARM) and\ntwo-stage sample selective strategy (TS4). The ARM can convert preseted\nhorizontal anchors into high-quality rotated anchors through twostage anchor\nrefinement. The TS4 module utilizes different constrained sample selective\nstrategies to allocate positive and negative samples, which is adaptive to the\nregression task in different stages. Benefiting from the ARM and TS4, the\nTS4Net can achieve superior performance for rotating object detection solely\nwith one preseted horizontal anchor. Extensive experimental results on UAV-ROD\ndataset and three remote sensing datasets DOTA, HRSC2016 and UCAS-AOD\ndemonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against most\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

To address\nthese issues, we define a new neighbor-selection mechanism according to feature\ndistances and combine the two networks in the training procedure.

We consider\nthe realistic setting where each agent acquires sensor data and is capable of\nlocal processing before sending updates to a base station, which is in charge\nof making decisions or monitoring phenomena of interest in real time. Longer\nprocessing at an agent leads to more informative updates but also larger\ndelays, giving rise to a delay-accuracy-tradeoff in choosing the right amount\nof local processing at each agent. We assume that the available communication\nresources are limited due to interference, bandwidth, and power constraints.\nThus, a scheduling policy needs to be designed to suitably share the\ncommunication channel among the agents. To that end, we develop a general\nformulation to jointly optimize the local processing at the agents and the\nscheduling of transmissions. Our novel formulation leverages the notion of Age\nof Information to quantify the freshness of data and capture the delays caused\nby computation and communication. We develop efficient resource allocation\nalgorithms using the Whittle index approach and demonstrate our proposed\nalgorithms in two practical applications: multi-agent occupancy grid mapping in\ntime-varying environments, and ride sharing in autonomous vehicle networks.

The\nstructure of Extreme Leaning Machine was not designed to feed two input data\nstreams simultaneously, thus, in 2-input scenarios Extreme Learning Machine\nmethods are normally applied using concatenated inputs. However, this setup\nconsumes two times more computational resources and it is not optimized for\nrecognition tasks where learning a separable distance metric is critical. For\nthese reasons, we propose and develop a Siamese Extreme Learning Machine\n(SELM). SELM was designed to be fed with two data streams in parallel\nsimultaneously.

    "abstract": "The nonlinear space-fractional problems often allow multiple stationary\nsolutions, which can be much more complicated than the corresponding\ninteger-order problems. In this paper, we systematically compute the solution\nlandscapes of nonlinear constant/variable-order space-fractional problems. A\nfast approximation algorithm is developed to deal with the variable-order\nspectral fractional Laplacian by approximating the variable-indexing Fourier\nmodes, and then combined with saddle dynamics to construct the solution\nlandscape of variable-order space-fractional phase field model. Numerical\nexperiments are performed to substantiate the accuracy and efficiency of fast\napproximation algorithm and elucidate essential features of the stationary\nsolutions of space-fractional phase field model. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat the solution landscapes of spectral fractional Laplacian problems can be\nreconfigured by varying the diffusion coefficients in the corresponding\ninteger-order problems.",

    "title": "Attainment Regions in Feature-Parameter Space for High-Level Debugging  in Autonomous Robots",
    "abstract": "Understanding a controller's performance in different scenarios is crucial\nfor robots that are going to be deployed in safety-critical tasks. If we do not\nhave a model of the dynamics of the world, which is often the case in complex\ndomains, we may need to approximate a performance function of the robot based\non its interaction with the environment. Such a performance function gives us\ninsights into the behaviour of the robot, allowing us to fine-tune the\ncontroller with manual interventions. In high-dimensionality systems, where the\nactionstate space is large, fine-tuning a controller is non-trivial. To\novercome this problem, we propose a performance function whose domain is\ndefined by external features and parameters of the controller. Attainment\nregions are defined over such a domain defined by feature-parameter pairs, and\nserve the purpose of enabling prediction of successful execution of the task.\nThe use of the feature-parameter space -in contrast to the action-state space-\nallows us to adapt, explain and finetune the controller over a simpler (i.e.,\nlower dimensional space). When the robot successfully executes the task, we use\nthe attainment regions to gain insights into the limits of the controller, and\nits robustness. When the robot fails to execute the task, we use the regions to\ndebug the controller and find adaptive and counterfactual changes to the\nsolutions. Another advantage of this approach is that we can generalise through\nthe use of Gaussian processes regression of the performance function in the\nhigh-dimensional space. To test our approach, we demonstrate learning an\napproximation to the performance function in simulation, with a mobile robot\ntraversing different terrain conditions. Then, with a sample-efficient method,\nwe propagate the attainment regions to a physical robot in a similar\nenvironment.",

Previous methods mainly focus on using simplex\nsolutions, lowering the upper bound of feature collaboration among and across\nthese two cues.

By considering the\nmutual restraint within the full-duplex strategy, our FSNet performs the\ncross-modal feature-passing (i.e., transmission and receiving) simultaneously\nbefore the fusion and decoding stage, making it robust to various challenging\nscenarios (e.g., motion blur, occlusion) in VOS.

    "title": "Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Image Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Domain adaptation (DA) has drawn high interest for its capacity to adapt a\nmodel trained on labeled source data to perform well on unlabeled or weakly\nlabeled target data from a different domain. Most common DA techniques require\nconcurrent access to the input images of both the source and target domains.\nHowever, in practice, privacy concerns often impede the availability of source\nimages in the adaptation phase. This is a very frequent DA scenario in medical\nimaging, where, for instance, the source and target images could come from\ndifferent clinical sites. We introduce a source-free domain adaptation for\nimage segmentation. Our formulation is based on minimizing a label-free entropy\nloss defined over target-domain data, which we further guide with a\ndomain-invariant prior on the segmentation regions. Many priors can be derived\nfrom anatomical information. Here, a class ratio prior is estimated from\nanatomical knowledge and integrated in the form of a Kullback Leibler (KL)\ndivergence in our overall loss function. Furthermore, we motivate our overall\nloss with an interesting link to maximizing the mutual information between the\ntarget images and their label predictions. We show the effectiveness of our\nprior aware entropy minimization in a variety of domain-adaptation scenarios,\nwith different modalities and applications, including spine, prostate, and\ncardiac segmentation. Our method yields comparable results to several state of\nthe art adaptation techniques, despite having access to much less information,\nas the source images are entirely absent in our adaptation phase. Our\nstraightforward adaptation strategy uses only one network, contrary to popular\nadversarial techniques, which are not applicable to a source-free DA setting.\nOur framework can be readily used in a breadth of segmentation problems, and\nour code is publicly available: https://github.com/mathilde-b/SFDA",

To enhance the maximum achievable timely delivery\nratio (TDR), we define a dynamic control scheme that allows each active node to\ndetermine the transmission probability with certainty based on the current\ndelivery urgency and the knowledge of current contention intensity. For an\nidealized environment where the contention intensity is completely known, we\ndevelop an analytical framework based on the theory of Markov Decision Process\n(MDP), which leads to an optimal scheme by applying backward induction. For a\nrealistic environment where the contention intensity is incompletely known, we\ndevelop a framework using Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP),\nwhich can in theory be solved. We show that for both environments, there exists\nan optimal scheme that is optimal over all types of policies. To overcome the\ninfeasibility in obtaining an optimal or near-optimal scheme from the POMDP\nframework, we investigate the behaviors of the optimal scheme for two extreme\ncases in the MDP framework, and leverage intuition gained from these behaviors\nto propose a heuristic scheme for the realistic environment with TDR close to\nthe maximum achievable TDR in the idealized environment.

    "title": "Adaptive Simulated Annealing with Greedy Search for the Circle Bin  Packing Problem",
    "abstract": "We introduce a new bin packing problem, termed the circle bin packing problem\nwith circular items (CBPP-CI). The problem involves packing all the circular\nitems into multiple identical circle bins as compact as possible with the\nobjective of minimizing the number of used bins. We first define the tangent\noccupying action (TOA) and propose a constructive greedy algorithm that\nsequentially packs the items into places tangent to the packed items or the bin\nboundaries. Moreover, to avoid falling into a local minimum trap and\nefficiently judge whether an optimal solution has been established, we continue\nto present the adaptive simulated annealing with greedy search (ASA-GS)\nalgorithm that explores and exploits the search space efficiently.\nSpecifically, we offer two novel local perturbation strategies to jump out of\nthe local optimum and incorporate the greedy search to achieve faster\nconvergence. The parameters of ASA-GS are adaptive according to the number of\nitems so that they can be size-agnostic across the problem scale. We design two\nsets of new benchmark instances, and the empirical results show that ASA-GS\ncompletely outperforms the constructive greedy algorithm. Moreover, the packing\ndensity of ASA-GS on the top few dense bins is much higher than that of the\nstate-of-the-art algorithm for the single circle packing problem, inferring the\nhigh quality of the packing solutions for CBPP-CI.",

    "abstract": "The public's attitudes play a critical role in the acceptance, purchase, use,\nand research and development of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To date, the\npublic's attitudes towards AVs were mostly estimated through traditional survey\ndata with high labor costs and a low quantity of samples, which also might be\none of the reasons why the influencing factors on the public's attitudes of AVs\nhave not been studied from multiple aspects in a comprehensive way yet. To\naddress the issue, this study aims to propose a method by using large-scale\nsocial media data to investigate key factors that affect the public's attitudes\nand acceptance of AVs. A total of 954,151 Twitter data related to AVs and 53\ncandidate independent variables from seven categories were extracted using the\nweb scraping method. Then, sentiment analysis was used to measure the public\nattitudes towards AVs by calculating sentiment scores. Random forests algorithm\nwas employed to preliminarily select candidate independent variables according\nto their importance, while a linear mixed model was performed to explore the\nimpacting factors considering the unobserved heterogeneities caused by the\nsubjectivity level of tweets. The results showed that the overall attitude of\nthe public on AVs was slightly optimistic. Factors like \"drunk\", \"blind spot\",\nand \"mobility\" had the largest impacts on public attitudes. In addition, people\nwere more likely to express positive feelings when talking about words such as\n\"lidar\" and \"Tesla\" that relate to high technologies. Conversely, factors such\nas \"COVID-19\", \"pedestrian\", \"sleepy\", and \"highway\" were found to have\nsignificantly negative effects on the public's attitudes. The findings of this\nstudy are beneficial for the development of AV technologies, the guidelines for\nAV-related policy formulation, and the public's understanding and acceptance of\nAVs.",

Existing estimators typically require\nsignificant tuning or training with a large amount of data, including the\nground truth, to achieve satisfactory performance. This paper proposes a\ndata-efficient differentiable moving horizon estimation (DMHE) algorithm that\ncan automatically tune the MHE parameters online and also adapt to different\nscenarios. We achieve this by deriving the analytical gradient of the estimated\ntrajectory from MHE with respect to the tuning parameters, enabling end-to-end\nlearning for auto-tuning. Most interestingly, we show that the gradient can be\ncalculated efficiently from a Kalman filter in a recursive form. Moreover, we\ndevelop a model-based policy gradient algorithm to learn the parameters\ndirectly from the trajectory tracking errors without the need for the ground\ntruth. The proposed DMHE can be further embedded as a layer with other neural\nnetworks for joint optimization. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed method via both simulation and experiments on quadrotors, where\nchallenging scenarios such as sudden payload change and flying in downwash are\nexamined.",

To tackle this, we present FloMore, which directly considers the\nbandwidth needs of individual services and ensures they are met a desired\npercentage of time. Rather than meet the requirements for all services over the\nsame set of failure states, FloMore exploits a key opportunity that each\nservice could meet its bandwidth requirements over a different set of failure\nstates. FloMore consists of an offline phase that identifies the critical\nfailure states of each service, and on failure allocates traffic in a manner\nthat prioritizes those services for which that failure state is critical. We\npresent a novel decomposition scheme to handle FloMore's offline phase in a\ntractable manner.

However, generating\nBEV maps requires complex multi-stage paradigms that encapsulate a series of\ndistinct tasks such as depth estimation, ground plane estimation, and semantic\nsegmentation. These sub-tasks are often learned in a disjoint manner which\nprevents the model from holistic reasoning and results in erroneous BEV maps.\nMoreover, existing algorithms only predict the semantics in the BEV space,\nwhich limits their use in applications where the notion of object instances is\ncritical. In this work, we present the first end-to-end learning approach for\ndirectly predicting dense panoptic segmentation maps in the BEV, given a single\nmonocular image in the frontal view (FV). Our architecture follows the top-down\nparadigm and incorporates a novel dense transformer module consisting of two\ndistinct transformers that learn to independently map vertical and flat regions\nin the input image from the FV to the BEV.

Over the last decade, many quantum machine learning\n(QML) algorithms have been proposed as candidates for such exponential\nimprovements. However, two issues unravel the hope of exponential speedup for\nsome of these QML algorithms: the data-loading problem and, more recently, the\nstunning dequantization results of Tang et al. A third issue, namely the\nfault-tolerance requirements of most QML algorithms, has further hindered their\npractical realization. The quantum topological data analysis (QTDA) algorithm\nof Lloyd, Garnerone and Zanardi was one of the first QML algorithms that\nconvincingly offered an expected exponential speedup. From the outset, it did\nnot suffer from the data-loading problem. A recent result has also shown that\nthe generalized problem solved by this algorithm is likely classically\nintractable, and would therefore be immune to any dequantization efforts.\nHowever, the QTDA algorithm of Lloyd et~al. has a time complexity of\n$O(n^4/(\\epsilon^2 \\delta))$ (where $n$ is the number of data points,\n$\\epsilon$ is the error tolerance, and $\\delta$ is the smallest nonzero\neigenvalue of the restricted Laplacian) and requires fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputing, which has not yet been achieved. In this paper, we completely\noverhaul the QTDA algorithm to achieve an improved exponential speedup and\ndepth complexity of $O(n\\log(1/(\\delta\\epsilon)))$.

Despite their remarkable performance, these\nmethods make a prior assumption that the low-resolution video is obtained by\ndown-scaling the high-resolution video using a known degradation kernel, which\ndoes not hold in practical settings. Another problem with these methods is that\nthey cannot exploit instance-specific internal information of video at testing\ntime. Recently, deep internal learning approaches have gained attention due to\ntheir ability to utilize the instance-specific statistics of a video.

However, simulating bulk materials fully at these scales is not\nfeasible, so that typically homogenized continuum descriptions are used\ninstead. A seamless and lossless transition of the constitutive description of\nthe elastic response of materials between these two scales has been so far\nelusive. Here we show how this problem can be overcome by using Artificial\nIntelligence (AI). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained, by\ntaking the structure image of a nanoporous material as input and the\ncorresponding elasticity tensor, calculated from Molecular Statics (MS), as\noutput. Trained with the atomistic data, the CNN model captures the size- and\npore-dependency of the material's elastic properties which, on the physics\nside, can stem from surfaces and non-local effects. Such effects are often\nignored in upscaling from atomistic to classical continuum theory. To\ndemonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the trained CNN model, a Finite\nElement Method (FEM) based result of an elastically deformed nanoporous beam\nequipped with the CNN as constitutive law is compared with that by a full\natomistic simulation. The good agreement between the atomistic simulations and\nthe FEM-AI combination for a system with size and surface effects establishes a\nnew lossless scale bridging approach to such problems. The trained CNN model\ndeviates from the atomistic result by 9.6\\% for porosity scenarios of up to\n90\\% but it is about 230 times faster than the MS calculation and does not\nrequire to change simulation methods between different scales.

    "abstract": "Market indicators such as CPI and GDP have been widely used over decades to\nidentify the stage of business cycles and also investment attractiveness of\nsectors given market conditions. In this paper, we propose a two-stage\nmethodology that consists of predicting ETF prices for each sector using market\nindicators and ranking sectors based on their predicted rate of returns. We\ninitially start with choosing sector specific macroeconomic indicators and\nimplement Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm to select the most important\nfeatures for each sector. Using our prediction tool, we implement different\nRecurrent Neural Networks models to predict the future ETF prices for each\nsector. We then rank the sectors based on their predicted rate of returns. We\nselect the best performing model by evaluating the annualized return,\nannualized Sharpe ratio, and Calmar ratio of the portfolios that includes the\ntop four ranked sectors chosen by the model. We also test the robustness of the\nmodel performance with respect to lookback windows and look ahead windows. Our\nempirical results show that our methodology beats the equally weighted\nportfolio performance even in the long run. We also find that Echo State\nNetworks exhibits an outstanding performance compared to other models yet it is\nfaster to implement compared to other RNN models.",

    "abstract": "Institutional investors have been increasing the allocation of the illiquid\nalternative assets such as private equity funds in their portfolios, yet there\nexists a very limited literature on cash flow forecasting of illiquid\nalternative assets. The net cash flow of private equity funds typically follow\na J-curve pattern, however the timing and the size of the contributions and\ndistributions depend on the investment opportunities. In this paper, we develop\na benchmark model and present two novel approaches (direct vs. indirect) to\npredict the cash flows of private equity funds. We introduce a sliding window\napproach to apply on our cash flow data because different vintage year funds\ncontain different lengths of cash flow information. We then pass the data to an\nLSTM/ GRU model to predict the future cash flows either directly or indirectly\n(based on the benchmark model). We further integrate macroeconomic indicators\ninto our data, which allows us to consider the impact of market environment on\ncash flows and to apply stress testing. Our results indicate that the direct\nmodel is easier to implement compared to the benchmark model and the indirect\nmodel, but still the predicted cash flows align better with the actual cash\nflows. We also show that macroeconomic variables improve the performance of the\ndirect model whereas the impact is not obvious on the indirect model.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic flows of an advective-diffusive nature are ubiquitous in physical\nsciences. Of particular interest is the problem to reconcile observed marginal\ndistributions with a given prior posed by E. Schrodinger in 1932/32 and known\nas the Schrodinger Bridge Problem (SBP). Due to its fundamental significance,\ninterest in SBP has in recent years enticed a broad spectrum of disciplines.\nYet, while the mathematics and applications of SBP have been developing at a\nconsiderable pace, accounting for marginals of unequal mass has received scant\nattention; the problem to interpolate between unbalanced marginals has been\napproached by introducing source/sink terms in an Adhoc manner. Nevertheless,\nlosses are inherent in many physical processes and, thereby, models that\naccount for lossy transport may also need to be reconciled with observed\nmarginals following Schrodinger's dictum; that is, to adjust the probability of\ntrajectories of particles, including those that do not make it to the terminal\nobservation point, so that the updated law represents the most likely way that\nparticles may have been transported, or vanished, at some intermediate point.\nThus, the purpose of this work is to develop such a natural generalization of\nthe SBP for stochastic evolution with losses, whereupon particles are \"killed\"\naccording to a probabilistic law. Through a suitable embedding, we turn the\nproblem into an SBP for stochastic processes that combine diffusive and jump\ncharacteristics. Then, following a large-deviations formalism, given a prior\nlaw that allows for losses, we ask for the most probable evolution of particles\nalong with the most likely killing rate as the particles transition between the\nspecified marginals. Our approach differs sharply from previous work involving\na Feynman-Kac multiplicative reweighing of the reference measure: The latter,\nas we argue, is far from Schrodinger's quest.",

These systems of first order hyperbolic\nPDEs allow to study the dynamics of the matter and the dynamics of the\nspace-time according to the theory of general relativity.\nThe new well balanced finite volume scheme presented here exploits the\nknowledge of an equilibrium solution of interest when integrating the\nconservative fluxes, the nonconservative products and the algebraic source\nterms, and also when performing the piecewise linear data reconstruction. This\nresults in a rather simple modification of the underlying second order FV\nscheme, which, however, being able to cancel numerical errors committed with\nrespect to the equilibrium component of the numerical solution, substantially\nimproves the accuracy and long-time stability of the numerical scheme when\nsimulating small perturbations of stationary equilibria. In particular, the\nneed for well balanced techniques appears to be more and more crucial as the\napplications increase their complexity. We close the paper with a series of\nnumerical tests of increasing difficulty, where we study the evolution of small\nperturbations of accretion problems and stable TOV neutron stars.

Despite\nremarkable advances achieved by traditional process-based methods, statistical\napproaches and recently famous deep learning-based models, few works have\nfocused on producing several kinds of rocks with one trained model and allowing\nthe reconstructed samples to satisfy certain given properties, such as\nporosity. To fill this gap, we propose a new framework, named RockGPT, which is\ncomposed of VQ-VAE and conditional GPT, to synthesize 3D samples based on a\nsingle 2D slice from the perspective of video generation. The VQ-VAE is\nutilized to compress high-dimensional input video, i.e., the sequence of\ncontinuous rock slices, to discrete latent codes and reconstruct them. In order\nto obtain diverse reconstructions, the discrete latent codes are modeled using\nconditional GPT in an autoregressive manner, while incorporating conditional\ninformation from a given slice, rock type, and porosity. We conduct two\nexperiments on five kinds of rocks, and the results demonstrate that RockGPT\ncan produce different kinds of rocks with the same model, and the reconstructed\nsamples can successfully meet certain specified porosities. In a broader sense,\nthrough leveraging the proposed conditioning scheme, RockGPT constitutes an\neffective way to build a general model to produce multiple kinds of rocks\nsimultaneously that also satisfy user-defined properties.",

    "title": "RadioMic: Sound Sensing via mmWave Signals",
    "abstract": "Voice interfaces has become an integral part of our lives, with the\nproliferation of smart devices. Today, IoT devices mainly rely on microphones\nto sense sound. Microphones, however, have fundamental limitations, such as\nweak source separation, limited range in the presence of acoustic insulation,\nand being prone to multiple side-channel attacks. In this paper, we propose\nRadioMic, a radio-based sound sensing system to mitigate these issues and\nenrich sound applications. RadioMic constructs sound based on tiny vibrations\non active sources (e.g., a speaker or human throat) or object surfaces (e.g.,\npaper bag), and can work through walls, even a soundproof one. To convert the\nextremely weak sound vibration in the radio signals into sound signals,\nRadioMic introduces radio acoustics, and presents training-free approaches for\nrobust sound detection and high-fidelity sound recovery. It then exploits a\nneural network to further enhance the recovered sound by expanding the\nrecoverable frequencies and reducing the noises. RadioMic translates massive\nonline audios to synthesized data to train the network, and thus minimizes the\nneed of RF data. We thoroughly evaluate RadioMic under different scenarios\nusing a commodity mmWave radar. The results show RadioMic outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art systems significantly. We believe RadioMic provides new\nhorizons for sound sensing and inspires attractive sensing capabilities of\nmmWave sensing devices",

    "title": "Feature Augmented Hybrid CNN for Stress Recognition Using Wrist-based  Photoplethysmography Sensor",
    "abstract": "Stress is a physiological state that hampers mental health and has serious\nconsequences to physical health. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased\nstress levels among people across the globe. Therefore, continuous monitoring\nand detection of stress are necessary. The recent advances in wearable devices\nhave allowed the monitoring of several physiological signals related to stress.\nAmong them, wrist-worn wearable devices like smartwatches are most popular due\nto their convenient usage. And the photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor is the\nmost prevalent sensor in almost all consumer-grade wrist-worn smartwatches.\nTherefore, this paper focuses on using a wrist-based PPG sensor that collects\nBlood Volume Pulse (BVP) signals to detect stress which may be applicable for\nconsumer-grade wristwatches. Moreover, state-of-the-art works have used either\nclassical machine learning algorithms to detect stress using hand-crafted\nfeatures or have used deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) which automatically extracts features. This paper proposes a\nnovel hybrid CNN (H-CNN) classifier that uses both the hand-crafted features\nand the automatically extracted features by CNN to detect stress using the BVP\nsignal. Evaluation on the benchmark WESAD dataset shows that, for 3-class\nclassification (Baseline vs. Stress vs. Amusement), our proposed H-CNN\noutperforms traditional classifiers and normal CNN by 5% and 7% accuracy, and\n10% and 7% macro F1 score, respectively. Also for 2-class classification\n(Stress vs. Non-stress), our proposed H-CNN outperforms traditional classifiers\nand normal CNN by 3% and ~5% accuracy, and ~3% and ~7% macro F1 score,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "In CS literature, the efforts can be divided into two groups: finding a\nmeasurement matrix that preserves the compressed information at the maximum\nlevel, and finding a reconstruction algorithm for the compressed information.\nIn the traditional CS setup, the measurement matrices are selected as random\nmatrices, and optimization-based iterative solutions are used to recover the\nsignals. However, when we handle large signals, using random matrices become\ncumbersome especially when it comes to iterative optimization-based solutions.\nEven though recent deep learning-based solutions boost the reconstruction\naccuracy performance while speeding up the recovery, still jointly learning the\nwhole measurement matrix is a difficult process. In this work, we introduce a\nseparable multi-linear learning of the CS matrix by representing it as the\nsummation of arbitrary number of tensors. For a special case where the CS\noperation is set as a single tensor multiplication, the model is reduced to the\nlearning-based separable CS; while a dense CS matrix can be approximated and\nlearned as the summation of multiple tensors. Both cases can be used in CS of\ntwo or multi-dimensional signals e.g., images, multi-spectral images, videos,\netc. Structural CS matrices can also be easily approximated and learned in our\nmulti-linear separable learning setup with structural tensor sum\nrepresentation. Hence, our learnable generalized tensor summation CS operation\nencapsulates most CS setups including separable CS, non-separable CS\n(traditional vector-matrix multiplication), structural CS, and CS of the\nmulti-dimensional signals. For both gray-scale and RGB images, the proposed\nscheme surpasses most state-of-the-art solutions, especially in lower\nmeasurement rates. Although the performance gain remains limited from tensor to\nthe sum of tensor representation for gray-scale images, it becomes significant\nin the RGB case.",

    "abstract": "This article elaborates on how machine learning (ML) can leverage the\nsolution of a contemporary problem related to the security of maritime domains.\nThe worldwide ``Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated'' (IUU) fishing incidents\nhave led to serious environmental and economic consequences which involve\ndrastic changes in our ecosystems in addition to financial losses caused by the\ndepletion of natural resources. The Fisheries and Aquatic Department (FAD) of\nthe United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) issued a report\nwhich indicated that the annual losses due to IUU fishing reached $25 Billion.\nThis imposes negative impacts on the future-biodiversity of the marine\necosystem and domestic Gross National Product (GNP). Hence, robust interception\nmechanisms are increasingly needed for detecting and pursuing the unrelenting\nillegal fishing incidents in maritime territories. This article addresses the\nproblem of coordinating the motion of a fleet of marine vessels (pursuers) to\ncatch an IUU vessel while still in local waters. The problem is formulated as a\npursuer-evader problem that is tackled within an ML framework. One or more\npursuers, such as law enforcement vessels, intercept an evader (i.e., the\nillegal fishing ship) using an online reinforcement learning mechanism that is\nbased on a value iteration process. It employs real-time navigation\nmeasurements of the evader ship as well as those of the pursuing vessels and\nreturns back model-free interception strategies.",

It is a fascinating problem in complexity\ntheory---its hardness is mysterious, and a better understanding of its hardness\ncan have surprising implications to many fields in computer science.\nWe first define and investigate the basic complexity-theoretic properties of\nminimum quantum circuit size problems for three natural objects: Boolean\nfunctions, unitaries, and quantum states. We show that these problems are not\ntrivially in NP but in QCMA (or have QCMA protocols). Next, we explore the\nrelations between the three quantum MCSPs and their variants. We discover that\nsome reductions that are not known for classical MCSP exist for quantum MCSPs\nfor unitaries and states, e.g., search-to-decision reduction and\nself-reduction. Finally, we systematically generalize results known for\nclassical MCSP to the quantum setting (including quantum cryptography, quantum\nlearning theory, quantum circuit lower bounds, and quantum fine-grained\ncomplexity) and also find new connections to tomography and quantum gravity.\nDue to the fundamental differences between classical and quantum circuits, most\nof our results require extra care and reveal properties and phenomena unique to\nthe quantum setting.

However, these methods exhibit\nlimitations in accounting for the uncertainty, unpredictability, and dynamic\nnature of the motion in real-world situations. In this paper, the inertial\nsensors data are fed to the LSTM network which are then updated incrementally\nto incorporate the dynamic changes in motion occurring in the run time. The\nrobustness and efficiency of the proposed framework is demonstrated on the\ndataset collected from a commercially available inertial measurement unit. The\nproposed framework offers a significant improvement in the results compared to\nthe traditional method, even in the case of a highly dynamic environment.

To properly\nencode such higher-order interactions, richer mathematical frameworks such as\nhypergraphs are needed, where hyperlinks describe connections among an\narbitrary number of nodes. Here we introduce the concept of higher-order\nmotifs, small connected subgraphs where vertices may be linked by interactions\nof any order. We provide lower and upper bounds on the number of higher-order\nmotifs as a function of the motif size, and propose an efficient algorithm to\nextract complete higher-order motif profiles from empirical data. We identify\ndifferent families of hypergraphs, characterized by distinct higher-order\nconnectivity patterns at the local scale. We also capture evidences of\nstructural reinforcement, a mechanism that associates higher strengths of\nhigher-order interactions for the nodes that interact more at the pairwise\nlevel. Our work highlights the informative power of higher-order motifs,\nproviding a first way to extract higher-order fingerprints in hypergraphs at\nthe network microscale.",
