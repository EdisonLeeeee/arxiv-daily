    "abstract": "We present a new method to create spatial data using a generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN). Our contribution uses coarse and widely available geospatial\ndata to create maps of less available features at the finer scale in the built\nenvironment, bypassing their traditional acquisition techniques (e.g. satellite\nimagery or land surveying). In the work, we employ land use data and road\nnetworks as input to generate building footprints, and conduct experiments in 9\ncities around the world. The method, which we implement in a tool we release\nopenly, enables generating approximate maps of the urban form, and it is\ngeneralisable to augment other types of geoinformation, enhancing the\ncompleteness and quality of spatial data infrastructure. It may be especially\nuseful in locations missing detailed and high-resolution data and those that\nare mapped with uncertain or heterogeneous quality, such as much of\nOpenStreetMap. The quality of the results is influenced by the urban form and\nscale. In most cases, experiments suggest promising performance as the method\ntends to truthfully indicate the locations, amount, and shape of buildings. The\nwork has the potential to support several applications, such as energy,\nclimate, and urban morphology studies in areas previously lacking required\ndata.",

If\nsuch surface cracks could be identified in time, it is of great significance\nfor the monitoring and early warning of geohazards. Currently, the most common\nmethod for crack identification is manual detection, which is with low\nefficiency and accuracy. In this paper, a deep transfer learning framework is\nproposed to effectively and efficiently identify slope surface cracks for the\nsake of fast monitoring and early warning of geohazards such as landslides. The\nessential idea is to employ transfer learning by training (a) the large sample\ndataset of concrete cracks and (b) the small sample dataset of soil and rock\nmasses cracks. In the proposed framework, (1) pretrained cracks identification\nmodels are constructed based on the large sample dataset of concrete cracks;\n(2) refined cracks identification models are further constructed based on the\nsmall sample dataset of soil and rock masses cracks.

    "abstract": "The neuroimage analysis community has neglected the automated segmentation of\nthe olfactory bulb (OB) despite its crucial role in olfactory function. The\nlack of an automatic processing method for the OB can be explained by its\nchallenging properties. Nonetheless, recent advances in MRI acquisition\ntechniques and resolution have allowed raters to generate more reliable manual\nannotations. Furthermore, the high accuracy of deep learning methods for\nsolving semantic segmentation problems provides us with an option to reliably\nassess even small structures. In this work, we introduce a novel, fast, and\nfully automated deep learning pipeline to accurately segment OB tissue on\nsub-millimeter T2-weighted (T2w) whole-brain MR images. To this end, we\ndesigned a three-stage pipeline: (1) Localization of a region containing both\nOBs using FastSurferCNN, (2) Segmentation of OB tissue within the localized\nregion through four independent AttFastSurferCNN - a novel deep learning\narchitecture with a self-attention mechanism to improve modeling of contextual\ninformation, and (3) Ensemble of the predicted label maps. The OB pipeline\nexhibits high performance in terms of boundary delineation, OB localization,\nand volume estimation across a wide range of ages in 203 participants of the\nRhineland Study. Moreover, it also generalizes to scans of an independent\ndataset never encountered during training, the Human Connectome Project (HCP),\nwith different acquisition parameters and demographics, evaluated in 30 cases\nat the native 0.7mm HCP resolution, and the default 0.8mm pipeline resolution.\nWe extensively validated our pipeline not only with respect to segmentation\naccuracy but also to known OB volume effects, where it can sensitively\nreplicate age effects.",

    "abstract": "Many benefits of online communities---such as obtaining new information,\nopportunities, and social connections---increase with size. Thus, a\n``successful'' online community often evokes an image of hundreds of thousands\nof users, and practitioners and researchers alike have sought to devise methods\nto achieve growth and thereby, success. On the other hand, small online\ncommunities exist in droves and many persist in their smallness over time.\nTurning to the highly popular discussion website Reddit, which is made up of\nhundreds of thousands of communities, we conducted a qualitative interview\nstudy examining how and why people participate in these persistently small\ncommunities, in order to understand why these communities exist when popular\napproaches would assume them to be failures. Drawing from twenty interviews,\nthis paper makes several contributions: we describe how small communities\nprovide unique informational and interactional spaces for participants, who are\ndrawn by the hyperspecific aspects of the community; we find that small\ncommunities do not promote strong dyadic interpersonal relationships but rather\npromote group-based identity; and we highlight how participation in small\ncommunities is part of a broader, ongoing strategy to curate participants'\nonline experience. We argue that online communities can be seen as nested\nniches: parts of an embedded, complex, symbiotic socio-informational ecosystem.\nWe suggest ways that social computing research could benefit from more\ndeliberate considerations of interdependence between diverse scales of online\ncommunity sizes.",

This paper focuses on a new\ntask for computational video editing, namely the task of raking cut\nplausibility. Our key idea is to leverage content that has already been edited\nto learn fine-grained audiovisual patterns that trigger cuts. To do this, we\nfirst collected a data source of more than 10K videos, from which we extract\nmore than 255K cuts. We devise a model that learns to discriminate between real\nand artificial cuts via contrastive learning. We set up a new task and a set of\nbaselines to benchmark video cut generation. We observe that our proposed model\noutperforms the baselines by large margins. To demonstrate our model in\nreal-world applications, we conduct human studies in a collection of unedited\nvideos. The results show that our model does a better job at cutting than\nrandom and alternative baselines.",

In the\nsetting of $f$-DP, we propose the concept canonical noise distribution (CND)\nwhich captures whether an additive privacy mechanism is appropriately tailored\nfor a given $f$, and give a construction that produces a CND given an arbitrary\ntradeoff function $f$. We show that private hypothesis tests are intimately\nrelated to CNDs, allowing for the release of private $p$-values at no\nadditional privacy cost as well as the construction of uniformly most powerful\n(UMP) tests for binary data.\nWe apply our techniques to the problem of difference of proportions testing,\nand construct a UMP unbiased \"semi-private\" test which upper bounds the\nperformance of any DP test. Using this as a benchmark we propose a private\ntest, based on the inversion of characteristic functions, which allows for\noptimal inference for the two population parameters and is nearly as powerful\nas the semi-private UMPU.

    "abstract": "Automatically generating videos in which synthesized speech is synchronized\nwith lip movements in a talking head has great potential in many human-computer\ninteraction scenarios. In this paper, we present an automatic method to\ngenerate synchronized speech and talking-head videos on the basis of text and a\nsingle face image of an arbitrary person as input. In contrast to previous\ntext-driven talking head generation methods, which can only synthesize the\nvoice of a specific person, the proposed method is capable of synthesizing\nspeech for any person that is inaccessible in the training stage. Specifically,\nthe proposed method decomposes the generation of synchronized speech and\ntalking head videos into two stages, i.e., a text-to-speech (TTS) stage and a\nspeech-driven talking head generation stage. The proposed TTS module is a\nface-conditioned multi-speaker TTS model that gets the speaker identity\ninformation from face images instead of speech, which allows us to synthesize a\npersonalized voice on the basis of the input face image. To generate the\ntalking head videos from the face images, a facial landmark-based method that\ncan predict both lip movements and head rotations is proposed. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate\nsynchronized speech and talking head videos for arbitrary persons and\nnon-persons. Synthesized speech shows consistency with the given face regarding\nto the synthesized voice's timbre and one's appearance in the image, and the\nproposed landmark-based talking head method outperforms the state-of-the-art\nlandmark-based method on generating natural talking head videos.",

    "abstract": "Natural numerical networks are introduced as a new classification algorithm\nbased on the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations of\nforward-backward diffusion type on complete graphs. The proposed natural\nnumerical network is applied to open important environmental and nature\nconservation task, the automated identification of protected habitats by using\nsatellite images. In the natural numerical network, the forward diffusion\ncauses the movement of points in a feature space toward each other. The\nopposite effect, keeping the points away from each other, is caused by backward\ndiffusion. This yields the desired classification. The natural numerical\nnetwork contains a few parameters that are optimized in the learning phase of\nthe method. After learning parameters and optimizing the topology of the\nnetwork graph, classification necessary for habitat identification is\nperformed. A relevancy map for each habitat is introduced as a tool for\nvalidating the classification and finding new Natura 2000 habitat appearances.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the interaction between cells, the recently introduced concept\nof Neural Cellular Automata shows promising results in a variety of tasks. So\nfar, this concept was mostly used to generate images for a single scenario. As\neach scenario requires a new model, this type of generation seems contradictory\nto the adaptability of cells in nature. To address this contradiction, we\nintroduce a concept using different initial environments as input while using a\nsingle Neural Cellular Automata to produce several outputs. Additionally, we\nintroduce GANCA, a novel algorithm that combines Neural Cellular Automata with\nGenerative Adversarial Networks, allowing for more generalization through\nadversarial training. The experiments show that a single model is capable of\nlearning several images when presented with different inputs, and that the\nadversarially trained model improves drastically on out-of-distribution data\ncompared to a supervised trained model.",

The mortality rate of this disease is high\nin patients suffering from immuno-compromised disorders. The early diagnosis of\nthis disease can save lives and can avoid further complications. But the\ndiagnosis of TB is a very complex task. The standard diagnostic tests still\nrely on traditional procedures developed in the last century. These procedures\nare slow and expensive. So this paper presents an automatic approach for the\ndiagnosis of TB from posteroanterior chest x-rays. This is a two-step approach,\nwhere in the first step the lung regions are segmented from the chest x-rays\nusing the graph cut method, and then in the second step the transfer learning\nof VGG16 combined with Bi-directional LSTM is used for extracting high-level\ndiscriminative features from the segmented lung regions and then classification\nis performed using a fully connected layer. The proposed model is evaluated\nusing data from two publicly available databases namely Montgomery Country set\nand Schezien set. The proposed model achieved accuracy and sensitivity of\n97.76%, 97.01% and 96.42%, 94.11% on Schezien and Montgomery county datasets.\nThis model enhanced the diagnostic accuracy of TB by 0.7% and 11.68% on\nSchezien and Montgomery county datasets.",

    "abstract": "Big Data are rapidly produced from various heterogeneous data sources. They\nare of different types (text, image, video or audio) and have different levels\nof reliability and completeness. One of the most interesting architectures that\ndeal with the large amount of emerging data at high velocity is called the\nlambda architecture. In fact, it combines two different processing layers\nnamely batch and speed layers, each providing specific views of data while\nensuring robustness, fast and scalable data processing. However, most papers\ndealing with the lambda architecture are focusing one single type of data\ngenerally produced by a single data source. Besides, the layers of the\narchitecture are implemented independently, or, at best, are combined to\nperform basic processing without assessing either the data reliability or\ncompleteness. Therefore, inspired by the lambda architecture, we propose in\nthis paper a generic multimodal architecture that combines both batch and\nstreaming processing in order to build a complete, global and accurate insight\nin near-real-time based on the knowledge extracted from multiple heterogeneous\nBig Data sources. Our architecture uses batch processing to analyze the data\nstructures and contents, build the learning models and calculate the\nreliability index of the involved sources, while the streaming processing uses\nthe built-in models of the batch layer to immediately process incoming data and\nrapidly provide results. We validate our architecture in the context of urban\ntraffic management systems in order to detect congestions.",

Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) techniques have\nshown promising results in classifying ultrasound images of the breast into\nbenign or malignant. However, CNN inference acts as a black-box model, and as\nsuch, its decision-making is not interpretable. Therefore, increasing effort\nhas been dedicated to explaining this process, most notably through GRAD-CAM\nand other techniques that provide visual explanations into inner workings of\nCNNs. In addition to interpretation, these methods provide clinically important\ninformation, such as identifying the location for biopsy or treatment.

Furthermore, we will\nshow that this change in the importance maps can come with or without altering\nthe classification result, rendering them even harder to detect. As such, care\nmust be taken when using these importance maps to shed light on the inner\nworkings of deep learning.

The unsupervised open domain\nadaption for generating realistic photos from a hand-drawn sketch is\nchallenging as there is no such sketch of that class for training data. The\nabsence of learning supervision and the huge domain gap between both the\nfreehand drawing and picture domains make it hard.

Due to the domain gap between\nsynthetic sketches and genuine ones, the generator trained on false drawings\nmay produce unsatisfactory results when dealing with drawings of lacking\nclasses. To address this problem, we offer a simple but effective open-domain\nsampling and optimization method that tricks the generator into considering\nfalse drawings as genuine. Our approach generalises the learnt sketch-to-photo\nand photo-to-sketch mappings from in-domain input to open-domain categories.

To address this problem, we use a new Multi-Task\nLearning (MTL) paradigm in which a facial attribute predictor uses the\nknowledge of other related attributes to obtain a better generalization\nperformance. Here, we leverage MLT paradigm in two problem settings. First, it\nis assumed that the structure of the tasks (e.g., grouping pattern of facial\nattributes) is known as a prior knowledge, and parameters of the tasks (i.e.,\npredictors) within the same group are represented by a linear combination of a\nlimited number of underlying basis tasks.

This permits the computation of\nvolume, surface area, mean curvature, Gaussian curvature, and the\nEuler-Poincar\\'e characteristic as well as comparison of these morphometrics\nbetween structures of different topology. The structures are commonly\nrepresented implicitly in curve evolution problems as the zero level set of an\nembedding. Practically, binary images of anatomical structures are embedded\nusing a signed distance transform. However, quantization prevents the accurate\ncomputation of curvatures, leading to considerable errors in morphometry. This\npaper presents a fast, simple embedding procedure for accurate local\nmorphometry as the zero crossing of the Gaussian blurred binary image. The\nproposed method was validated based on the femur and fourth lumbar vertebrae of\n50 clinical computed tomography datasets. The results show that the signed\ndistance transform leads to large quantization errors in the computed local\ncurvature. Global validation of morphometry using regression and Bland-Altman\nanalysis revealed that the coefficient of determination for the average mean\ncurvature is improved from 93.8% with the signed distance transform to 100%\nwith the proposed method. For the surface area, the proportional bias is\nimproved from -5.0% for the signed distance transform to +0.6% for the proposed\nmethod.

    "title": "Convolutional Nets for Diabetic Retinopathy Screening in Bangladeshi  Patients",
    "abstract": "Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in Bangladesh, and as\na result, Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is widespread in the population. DR, an eye\nillness caused by diabetes, can lead to blindness if it is not identified and\ntreated in its early stages. Unfortunately, diagnosis of DR requires medically\ntrained professionals, but Bangladesh has limited specialists in comparison to\nits population. Moreover, the screening process is often expensive, prohibiting\nmany from receiving timely and proper diagnosis. To address the problem, we\nintroduce a deep learning algorithm which screens for different stages of DR.\nWe use a state-of-the-art CNN architecture to diagnose patients based on\nretinal fundus imagery. This paper is an experimental evaluation of the\nalgorithm we developed for DR diagnosis and screening specifically for\nBangladeshi patients. We perform this validation study using separate pools of\nretinal image data of real patients from a hospital and field studies in\nBangladesh. Our results show that the algorithm is effective at screening\nBangladeshi eyes even when trained on a public dataset which is out of domain,\nand can accurately determine the stage of DR as well, achieving an overall\naccuracy of 92.27\\% and 93.02\\% on two validation sets of Bangladeshi eyes. The\nresults confirm the ability of the algorithm to be used in real clinical\nsettings and applications due to its high accuracy and classwise metrics. Our\nalgorithm is implemented in the application Drishti, which is used to screen\nfor DR in patients living in rural areas in Bangladesh, where access to\nprofessional screening is limited.",

    "abstract": "The performance of many medical image analysis tasks are strongly associated\nwith image data quality. When developing modern deep learning algorithms,\nrather than relying on subjective (human-based) image quality assessment (IQA),\ntask amenability potentially provides an objective measure of task-specific\nimage quality. To predict task amenability, an IQA agent is trained using\nreinforcement learning (RL) with a simultaneously optimised task predictor,\nsuch as a classification or segmentation neural network. In this work, we\ndevelop transfer learning or adaptation strategies to increase the adaptability\nof both the IQA agent and the task predictor so that they are less dependent on\nhigh-quality, expert-labelled training data. The proposed transfer learning\nstrategy re-formulates the original RL problem for task amenability in a\nmeta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) framework. The resulting algorithm\nfacilitates efficient adaptation of the agent to different definitions of image\nquality, each with its own Markov decision process environment including\ndifferent images, labels and an adaptable task predictor. Our work demonstrates\nthat the IQA agents pre-trained on non-expert task labels can be adapted to\npredict task amenability as defined by expert task labels, using only a small\nset of expert labels. Using 6644 clinical ultrasound images from 249 prostate\ncancer patients, our results for image classification and segmentation tasks\nshow that the proposed IQA method can be adapted using data with as few as\nrespective 19.7% and 29.6% expert-reviewed consensus labels and still achieve\ncomparable IQA and task performance, which would otherwise require a training\ndataset with 100% expert labels.",

    "abstract": "Due to its high efficiency, routing based on greedy embeddings of rooted\nspanning trees is a promising approach for dynamic, large-scale networks with\nrestricted topologies. Friend-to-friend (F2F) overlays, one key application of\nembedding-based routing, aim to prevent disclosure of their participants to\nmalicious members by restricting exchange of messages to mutually trusted\nnodes. Since embeddings assign a unique integer vector to each node that\nencodes its position in a spanning tree of the overlay, attackers can infer\nnetwork structure from knowledge about assigned vectors. As this information\ncan be used to identify participants, an evaluation of the scale of leakage is\nneeded. In this work, we analyze in detail which information malicious\nparticipants can infer from knowledge about assigned vectors. Also, we show\nthat by monitoring packet trajectories, malicious participants cannot\nunambiguously infer links between nodes of unidentified participants. Using\nsimulation, we find that the vector assignment procedure has a strong impact on\nthe feasibility of inference. In F2F overlay networks, using vectors of\nrandomly chosen numbers for routing decreases the mean number of discovered\nindividuals by one order of magnitude compared to the popular approach of using\nchild enumeration indexes as vector elements.",

Most pure Nash equilibria\nof the ensuing game yield a matching that is unstable with respect to the\nindividuals' sincere preferences. We introduce a well-supported minimal\ndishonesty constraint, and obtain conditions under which every pure Nash\nequilibrium yields a matching that is stable with respect to the sincere\npreferences. The conditions on the matching algorithm are to be either\nfully-randomized, or monotonic and independent of non-spouses (INS), an\nIIA-like property.

    "abstract": "For the past ten years, CNN has reigned supreme in the world of computer\nvision, but recently, Transformer is on the rise. However, the quadratic\ncomputational cost of self-attention has become a severe problem of practice.\nThere has been much research on architectures without CNN and self-attention in\nthis context. In particular, MLP-Mixer is a simple idea designed using MLPs and\nhit an accuracy comparable to the Vision Transformer. However, the only\ninductive bias in this architecture is the embedding of tokens. Thus, there is\nstill a possibility to build a non-convolutional inductive bias into the\narchitecture itself, and we built in an inductive bias using two simple ideas.\nA way is to divide the token-mixing block vertically and horizontally. Another\nway is to make spatial correlations denser among some channels of token-mixing.\nWith this approach, we were able to improve the accuracy of the MLP-Mixer while\nreducing its parameters and computational complexity. Compared to other\nMLP-based models, the proposed model, named RaftMLP has a good balance of\ncomputational complexity, the number of parameters, and actual memory usage. In\naddition, our work indicates that MLP-based models have the potential to\nreplace CNNs by adopting inductive bias.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being adopted in a wide variety of\napplication domains. Usually, a well-performing ML model, especially, emerging\ndeep neural network model, relies on a large volume of training data and\nhigh-powered computational resources. The need for a vast volume of available\ndata raises serious privacy concerns because of the risk of leakage of highly\nprivacy-sensitive information and the evolving regulatory environments that\nincreasingly restrict access to and use of privacy-sensitive data. Furthermore,\na trained ML model may also be vulnerable to adversarial attacks such as\nmembership/property inference attacks and model inversion attacks. Hence,\nwell-designed privacy-preserving ML (PPML) solutions are crucial and have\nattracted increasing research interest from academia and industry. More and\nmore efforts of PPML are proposed via integrating privacy-preserving techniques\ninto ML algorithms, fusing privacy-preserving approaches into ML pipeline, or\ndesigning various privacy-preserving architectures for existing ML systems. In\nparticular, existing PPML arts cross-cut ML, system, security, and privacy;\nhence, there is a critical need to understand state-of-art studies, related\nchallenges, and a roadmap for future research. This paper systematically\nreviews and summarizes existing privacy-preserving approaches and proposes a\nPGU model to guide evaluation for various PPML solutions through elaborately\ndecomposing their privacy-preserving functionalities. The PGU model is designed\nas the triad of Phase, Guarantee, and technical Utility. Furthermore, we also\ndiscuss the unique characteristics and challenges of PPML and outline possible\ndirections of future work that benefit a wide range of research communities\namong ML, distributed systems, security, and privacy areas.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the significant damage caused by various types of\nfake news. Although considerable effort has been applied to address this issue\nand much progress has been made on detecting fake news, most existing\napproaches mainly rely on the textual content and/or social context, while\nknowledge-level information---entities extracted from the news content and the\nrelations between them---is much less explored. Within the limited work on\nknowledge-based fake news detection, an external knowledge graph is often\nrequired, which may introduce additional problems: it is quite common for\nentities and relations, especially with respect to new concepts, to be missing\nin existing knowledge graphs, and both entity prediction and link prediction\nare open research questions themselves. Therefore, in this work, we investigate\n\\textbf{knowledge-based fake news detection that does not require any external\nknowledge graph.} Specifically, our contributions include: (1) transforming the\nproblem of detecting fake news into a subgraph classification task---entities\nand relations are extracted from each news item to form a single knowledge\ngraph, where a news item is represented by a subgraph. Then a graph neural\nnetwork (GNN) model is trained to classify each subgraph/news item. (2) Further\nimproving the performance of this model through a simple but effective\nmulti-modal technique that combines extracted knowledge, textual content and\nsocial context. Experiments on multiple datasets with thousands of labelled\nnews items demonstrate that our knowledge-based algorithm outperforms existing\ncounterpart methods, and its performance can be further boosted by the\nmulti-modal approach.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of knowledge tracing (KT) where the goal is to trace the\nstudents' knowledge mastery over time so as to make predictions on their future\nperformance. Owing to the good representation capacity of deep neural networks\n(DNNs), recent advances on KT have increasingly concentrated on exploring DNNs\nto improve the performance of KT. However, we empirically reveal that the DNNs\nbased KT models may run the risk of overfitting, especially on small datasets,\nleading to limited generalization. In this paper, by leveraging the current\nadvances in adversarial training (AT), we propose an efficient AT based KT\nmethod (ATKT) to enhance KT model's generalization and thus push the limit of\nKT. Specifically, we first construct adversarial perturbations and add them on\nthe original interaction embeddings as adversarial examples. The original and\nadversarial examples are further used to jointly train the KT model, forcing it\nis not only to be robust to the adversarial examples, but also to enhance the\ngeneralization over the original ones. To better implement AT, we then present\nan efficient attentive-LSTM model as KT backbone, where the key is a proposed\nknowledge hidden state attention module that adaptively aggregates information\nfrom previous knowledge hidden states while simultaneously highlighting the\nimportance of current knowledge hidden state to make a more accurate\nprediction.

Machine learning-based methods have\nbeen proposed for RFF extraction and discrimination. However, most existing\nmethods are designed for the closed-set scenario where the set of devices is\nremains unchanged. These methods can not be generalized to the RFF\ndiscrimination of unknown devices. To enable the discrimination of RFF from\nboth known and unknown devices, we propose a new end-to-end deep learning\nframework for extracting RFFs from raw received signals. The proposed framework\ncomprises a novel preprocessing module, called neural synchronization~(NS),\nwhich incorporates the data-driven learning with signal processing priors as an\ninductive bias from communication-model based processing. Compared to\ntraditional carrier synchronization techniques, which are static, this module\nestimates offsets by two learnable deep neural networks jointly trained by the\nRFF extractor. Additionally, a hypersphere representation is proposed to\nfurther improve the discrimination of RFF. Theoretical analysis shows that such\na data-and-model framework can better optimize the mutual information between\ndevice identity and the RFF, which naturally leads to better performance.\nExperimental results verify that the proposed RFF significantly outperforms\npurely data-driven DNN-design and existing handcrafted RFF methods in terms of\nboth discrimination and network generalizability.",

However, previous methods usually suffered from\ndiscrete nature of point cloud and unstructured prediction of points in local\nregions, which makes it hard to reveal fine local geometric details on the\ncomplete shape. To resolve this issue, we propose SnowflakeNet with Snowflake\nPoint Deconvolution (SPD) to generate the complete point clouds. The\nSnowflakeNet models the generation of complete point clouds as the\nsnowflake-like growth of points in 3D space, where the child points are\nprogressively generated by splitting their parent points after each SPD. Our\ninsight of revealing detailed geometry is to introduce skip-transformer in SPD\nto learn point splitting patterns which can fit local regions the best.\nSkip-transformer leverages attention mechanism to summarize the splitting\npatterns used in the previous SPD layer to produce the splitting in the current\nSPD layer. The locally compact and structured point cloud generated by SPD is\nable to precisely capture the structure characteristic of 3D shape in local\npatches, which enables the network to predict highly detailed geometries, such\nas smooth regions, sharp edges and corners.

Directly applying vanilla object detector to defect detection task can\nachieve promising results, while there still exists challenging issues that\nhave not been solved. The first issue is the texture shift which means a\ntrained defect detector model will be easily affected by unseen texture, and\nthe second issue is partial visual confusion which indicates that a partial\ndefect box is visually similar with a complete box. To tackle these two\nproblems, we propose a Reference-based Defect Detection Network (RDDN).\nSpecifically, we introduce template reference and context reference to against\nthose two problems, respectively.

A DT is an emerging but conceptually different construct than CPS.\nLike CPS, DT relies on communication to create a highly-consistent,\nsynchronized digital mirror image of the objects or physical processes. DT, in\naddition, uses built-in models on this precise image to simulate, analyze,\npredict, and optimize their real-time operation using feedback.

    "abstract": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is one of the core tasks in recommender\nsystems (RS). It predicts a personalized click probability for each user-item\npair. Recently, researchers have found that the performance of CTR model can be\nimproved greatly by taking user behavior sequence into consideration,\nespecially long-term user behavior sequence. The report on an e-commerce\nwebsite shows that 23\\% of users have more than 1000 clicks during the past 5\nmonths. Though there are numerous works focus on modeling sequential user\nbehaviors, few works can handle long-term user behavior sequence due to the\nstrict inference time constraint in real world system. Two-stage methods are\nproposed to push the limit for better performance. At the first stage, an\nauxiliary task is designed to retrieve the top-$k$ similar items from long-term\nuser behavior sequence. At the second stage, the classical attention mechanism\nis conducted between the candidate item and $k$ items selected in the first\nstage. However, information gap happens between retrieval stage and the main\nCTR task. This goal divergence can greatly diminishing the performance gain of\nlong-term user sequence. In this paper, inspired by Reformer, we propose a\nlocality-sensitive hashing (LSH) method called ETA (End-to-end Target\nAttention) which can greatly reduce the training and inference cost and make\nthe end-to-end training with long-term user behavior sequence possible.

Several remarkable references as\n\\cite{Fer:91,Ber:82constrained,Ber:89parallel,Tom:11} analyzed the tight local\nrelations between the convergence rate of PPA and the regularity of the\nobjective function. However, without taking into account the concrete\ncomputational effort paid for computing each PPA iteration, any iteration\ncomplexity remains abstract and purely informative. In this manuscript we aim\nto evaluate the computational complexity of practical PPA in terms of\n(proximal) gradient/subgradient iterations, which might allow a fair\npositioning of the famous PPA numerical performance in the class of first order\nmethods. First, we derive nonasymptotic iteration complexity estimates of exact\nand inexact PPA to minimize convex functions under $\\gamma-$Holderian growth:\n$\\BigO{\\log(1/\\epsilon)}$ (for $\\gamma \\in [1,2]$) and\n$\\BigO{1/\\epsilon^{\\gamma - 2}}$ (for $\\gamma > 2$). In particular, we recover\nwell-known results on exact PPA: finite convergence for sharp minima and linear\nconvergence for quadratic growth, even under presence of inexactness. Second,\nassuming that an usual (proximal) gradient/subgradient method subroutine is\nemployed to compute inexact PPA iteration, we show novel computational\ncomplexity bounds on a restarted variant of the inexact PPA, available when no\ninformation on the growth of the objective function is known.

Since the optimization problem for IAB\nnetwork is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP), we\ndivide it into three subproblems for association, subchannel allocation, and\npower allocation, respectively, and these subproblems are solved alternatively\nto obtain a local optimal solution. For the association problem, we adopt the\nLagrangian duality approach to configure the backhaul and access links and\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) approach is used to solve the subchannel\nand power allocation problems efficiently. Simulation results demonstrate that\nthe proposed algorithm achieves better performance than single-hop backhauling\nbased network and enhances the capacity and coverage by configuring the\nmulti-hop backhauling.",

This paper studies two practical\ndirections in asynchronous BFT. First, while all these asynchronous BFT\nprotocols assume optimal resilience with 3f+1 replicas (where f is an upper\nbound on the number of Byzantine replicas), it is interesting to ask whether\nmore efficient protocols are possible if relaxing the resilience level. Second,\nthese recent BFT protocols evaluate their performance under failure-free\nscenarios. It is unclear if these protocols indeed perform well during failures\nand attacks.\nThis work first studies asynchronous BFT with suboptimal resilience using\n5f+1 and 7f+1 replicas. We present MiB, a novel and efficient asynchronous BFT\nframework using new distributed system constructions as building blocks. MiB\nconsists of two main BFT instances and five other variants. As another\ncontribution, we systematically design experiments for asynchronous BFT\nprotocols with failures and evaluate their performance in various failure\nscenarios. We report interesting findings, showing asynchronous BFT indeed\nperforms consistently well during various failure scenarios. In particular, via\na five-continent deployment on Amazon EC2 using 140 replicas, we show the MiB\ninstances have lower latency and much higher throughput than their asynchronous\nBFT counterparts.",

When an agent\nselects an item, he leaves the market and obtains a payoff given by the value\nof the item, which is represented by a random variable following a known\ndistribution with support contained in [0, 1]. We consider two different\nsettings for this problem. In the first one, namely competitive selection\nproblem with no recall, agents observe the value of each item upon its arrival\nand decide whether to accept or reject it, in which case they will not select\nit in future. In the second setting, called competitive selection problem with\nrecall, agents are allowed to select any of the available items arrived so far.\nFor each of these problems, we describe the game induced by the selection\nproblem as a sequential game with imperfect information and study the set of\nsubgame-perfect Nash equilibrium payoffs. We also study the efficiency of the\ngame equilibria. More specifically, we address the question of how much better\nis to have the power of getting any available item against the\ntake-it-or-leave-it fashion. To this end, we define and study the price of\nanarchy and price of stability of a game instance as the ratio between the\nmaximal sum of payoffs obtained by players under any feasible strategy and the\nsum of payoffs for the worst and best subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium,\nrespectively. For the no recall case, we prove that if there are two agents and\ntwo items arriving sequentially over time, both the price of anarchy and price\nof stability are upper bounded by the constant 4/3 for any value distribution.\nEven more, we show that this bound is tight.",

Although many image manipulation location\nalgorithms have been proposed, most of them only focus on the RGB images with\ndifferent color spaces, and the frequency information that contains the\npotential tampering clues is often ignored. In this work, a novel end-to-end\ntwo-stream boundary-aware network (abbreviated as TBNet) is proposed for\ngeneric image manipulation localization in which the RGB stream, the frequency\nstream, and the boundary artifact location are explored in a unified framework.\nSpecifically, we first design an adaptive frequency selection module (AFS) to\nadaptively select the appropriate frequency to mine inconsistent statistics and\neliminate the interference of redundant statistics. Then, an adaptive\ncross-attention fusion module (ACF) is proposed to adaptively fuse the RGB\nfeature and the frequency feature. Finally, the boundary artifact location\nnetwork (BAL) is designed to locate the boundary artifacts for which the\nparameters are jointly updated by the outputs of the ACF, and its results are\nfurther fed into the decoder. Thus, the parameters of the RGB stream, the\nfrequency stream, and the boundary artifact location network are jointly\noptimized, and their latent complementary relationships are fully mined. The\nresults of extensive experiments performed on four public benchmarks of the\nimage manipulation localization task, namely, CASIA1.0, COVER, Carvalho, and\nIn-The-Wild, demonstrate that the proposed TBNet can significantly outperform\nstate-of-the-art generic image manipulation localization methods in terms of\nboth MCC and F1.",

One\nimportant area of sport-science research that features small data sets is the\nstudy of energy recovery from exercise. In this area, models are typically\nfitted to data collected from exhaustive exercise test protocols, which\nathletes can perform only a few times. Recent findings highlight that\nestablished recovery models like W' balance (W'bal) models are too simple to\nadequately fit observed trends in the data. Therefore, we investigated a\nhydraulic model that requires the same few data points as W'bal models to be\napplied, but promises to predict recovery dynamics more accurately.\nTo compare the hydraulic model to established W'bal models, we\nretrospectively applied them to a compilation of data from published studies.\nIn total, one hydraulic model and three W'bal models were compared on data\nextracted from five studies.

Moreover, visual-semantic information is often ignored. To solve\nthese issues, in this work, a novel multigranular visual-semantic embedding\nalgorithm (MVSE) is proposed for cloth-changing person ReID, where visual\nsemantic information and human attributes are embedded into the network, and\nthe generalized features of human appearance can be well learned to effectively\nsolve the problem of clothing changes. Specifically, to fully represent a\nperson with clothing changes, a multigranular feature representation scheme\n(MGR) is employed to focus on the unchanged part of the human, and then a cloth\ndesensitization network (CDN) is designed to improve the feature robustness of\nthe approach for the person with different clothing, where different high-level\nhuman attributes are fully utilized. Moreover, to further solve the issue of\npose changes and occlusion under different camera perspectives, a partially\nsemantically aligned network (PSA) is proposed to obtain the visual-semantic\ninformation that is used to align the human attributes.",

In a joint embedding space of the\ntwo modalities, our loss pulls images close to their person categories for\nmodality alignment.

This is crucial for applications such as inspection,\ndelivery, search and rescue, and drone racing. Early works used polynomial\ntrajectory formulations, which do not exploit the full actuator potential\nbecause of their inherent smoothness. Recent works resorted to numerical\noptimization but require waypoints to be allocated as costs or constraints at\nspecific discrete times. However, this time allocation is a priori unknown and\nrenders previous works incapable of producing truly time-optimal trajectories.\nTo generate truly time-optimal trajectories, we propose a solution to the time\nallocation problem while exploiting the full quadrotor's actuator potential. We\nachieve this by introducing a formulation of progress along the trajectory,\nwhich enables the simultaneous optimization of the time allocation and the\ntrajectory itself.

The recent advance\nin OCR enables the accurate recognition of text blocks, yet it is still\nchallenging to extract key information from documents due to the diversity of\ntheir layouts. Although recent studies on pre-trained language models show the\nimportance of incorporating layout information on this task, the conjugation of\ntexts and their layouts still follows the style of BERT optimized for\nunderstanding the 1D text. This implies there is room for further improvement\nconsidering the 2D nature of text layouts. This paper introduces a pre-trained\nlanguage model, BERT Relying On Spatiality (BROS), which effectively utilizes\nthe information included in individual text blocks and their layouts.\nSpecifically, BROS encodes spatial information by utilizing relative positions\nand learns spatial dependencies between OCR blocks with a novel area-masking\nstrategy. These two novel approaches lead to an efficient encoding of spatial\nlayout information highlighted by the robust performance of BROS under\nlow-resource environments. We also introduce a general-purpose parser that can\nbe combined with BROS to extract key information even when there is no order\ninformation between text blocks. BROS shows its superiority on four public\nbenchmarks---FUNSD, SROIE*, CORD, and SciTSR---and its robustness in practical\ncases where order information of text blocks is not available.

    "abstract": "Evolutionary neural architecture search (ENAS) has recently received\nincreasing attention by effectively finding high-quality neural architectures,\nwhich however consumes high computational cost by training the architecture\nencoded by each individual for complete epochs in individual evaluation.\nNumerous ENAS approaches have been developed to reduce the evaluation cost, but\nit is often difficult for most of these approaches to achieve high evaluation\naccuracy. To address this issue, in this paper we propose an accelerated ENAS\nvia multifidelity evaluation termed MFENAS, where the individual evaluation\ncost is significantly reduced by training the architecture encoded by each\nindividual for only a small number of epochs. The balance between evaluation\ncost and evaluation accuracy is well maintained by suggesting a multi-fidelity\nevaluation, which identifies the potentially good individuals that cannot\nsurvive from previous generations by integrating multiple evaluations under\ndifferent numbers of training epochs. For high diversity of neural\narchitectures, a population initialization strategy is devised to produce\ndifferent neural architectures varying from ResNet-like architectures to\nInception-like ones. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 show that the\narchitecture obtained by the proposed MFENAS achieves a 2.39% test error rate\nat the cost of only 0.6 GPU days on one NVIDIA 2080TI GPU, demonstrating the\nsuperiority of the proposed MFENAS over state-of-the-art NAS approaches in\nterms of both computational cost and architecture quality. The architecture\nobtained by the proposed MFENAS is then transferred to CIFAR-100 and ImageNet,\nwhich also exhibits competitive performance to the architectures obtained by\nexisting NAS approaches.

Existing datasets that aim to examine video reasoning capability\nfocus on visual signals such as actions, objects, relations, or could be\nanswered utilizing text bias. Observing this, we propose a novel task, along\nwith a new dataset: Trope Understanding in Movies and Animations (TrUMAn),\nintending to evaluate and develop learning systems beyond visual signals.\nTropes are frequently used storytelling devices for creative works. By coping\nwith the trope understanding task and enabling the deep cognition skills of\nmachines, we are optimistic that data mining applications and algorithms could\nbe taken to the next level.

This has left much of the\nmodern evolutionary literature relatively unexplored.\nTo understand which evolutionary mechanisms have been considered, and which\nhave been overlooked, this paper breaks down successful bio-inspired algorithms\nunder a contemporary biological framework based on the Extended Evolutionary\nSynthesis, an extension of the classical, genetics focussed, Modern Synthesis.\nThe analysis shows that Darwinism and the Modern Synthesis have been\nincorporated into Evolutionary Computation but that the Extended Evolutionary\nSynthesis has been broadly ignored beyond:cultural inheritance, incorporated in\nthe sub-set of Swarm Intelligence algorithms, evolvability, through CMA-ES, and\nmultilevel selection, through Multi-Level Selection Genetic Algorithm.\nThe framework shows a missing gap in epigenetic inheritance for Evolutionary\nComputation, despite being a key building block in modern interpretations of\nhow evolution occurs. Epigenetic inheritance can explain fast adaptation,\nwithout changes in an individual's genotype, by allowing biological organisms\nto self-adapt quickly to environmental cues, which, increases the speed of\nconvergence while maintaining stability in changing environments.

Federated Learning is gaining popularity\nbecause it allows one to use machine learning techniques while preserving\nprivacy.

For instance, Federated Learning is particularly\nvulnerable to data poisoning attacks that may deteriorate its performance and\nintegrity due to its distributed nature and inaccessibility to the raw data. In\naddition, it is extremely difficult to correctly identify malicious clients due\nto the non-Independently and/or Identically Distributed (non-IID) data.

Various data-driven approaches have been introduced to capture\nsubtle and local morphological changes of the brain accompanied by the disease\nprogression. One of the typical approaches for capturing subtle changes is\npatch-level feature representation. However, the predetermined regions to\nextract patches can limit classification performance by interrupting the\nexploration of potential biomarkers. In addition, the existing patch-level\nanalyses have difficulty explaining their decision-making. To address these\nproblems, we propose the BrainBagNet with a position-based gate\n(PG-BrainBagNet), a framework for jointly learning pathological region\nlocalization and AD diagnosis in an end-to-end manner. In advance, as all scans\nare aligned to a template in image processing, the position of brain images can\nbe represented through the 3D Cartesian space shared by the overall MRI scans.\nThe proposed method represents the patch-level response from whole-brain MRI\nscans and discriminative brain-region from position information. Based on the\noutcomes, the patch-level class evidence is calculated, and then the\nimage-level prediction is inferred by a transparent aggregation. The proposed\nmodels were evaluated on the ADNI datasets. In five-fold cross-validation, the\nclassification performance of the proposed method outperformed that of the\nstate-of-the-art methods in both AD diagnosis (AD vs. normal control) and mild\ncognitive impairment (MCI) conversion prediction (progressive MCI vs. stable\nMCI) tasks. In addition, changes in the identified discriminant regions and\npatch-level class evidence according to the patch size used for model training\nare presented and analyzed.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained models for programming languages have proven their significant\nvalues in various code-related tasks, such as code search, code clone\ndetection, and code translation. Currently, most pre-trained models treat a\ncode snippet as a sequence of tokens or only focus on the data flow between\ncode identifiers. However, rich code syntax and hierarchy are ignored which can\nprovide important structure information and semantic rules of codes to help\nenhance code representations. In addition, although the BERT-based code\npre-trained models achieve high performance on many downstream tasks, the\nnative derived sequence representations of BERT are proven to be of\nlow-quality, it performs poorly on code matching and similarity tasks. To\naddress these problems, we propose CLSEBERT, a Constrastive Learning Framework\nfor Syntax Enhanced Code Pre-Trained Model, to deal with various code\nintelligence tasks. In the pre-training stage, we consider the code syntax and\nhierarchy contained in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and leverage the\nconstrastive learning to learn noise-invariant code representations. Besides\nthe masked language modeling (MLM), we also introduce two novel pre-training\nobjectives. One is to predict the edges between nodes in the abstract syntax\ntree, and the other is to predict the types of code tokens. Through extensive\nexperiments on four code intelligence tasks, we successfully show the\neffectiveness of our proposed model.",

The same is true of deep neural networks, which currently\nconstitute the best performing artificial vision systems. Our goal is to\nexamine the congruence, or lack thereof, in the information-gathering\nstrategies of the two systems. We have operationalized our investigation as a\ncharacter recognition task. We have used eye-tracking to assay the spatial\ndistribution of information hotspots for humans via fixation maps and an\nactivation mapping technique for obtaining analogous distributions for deep\nnetworks through visualization maps. Qualitative comparison between\nvisualization maps and fixation maps reveals an interesting correlate of\ncongruence. The deep learning model considered similar regions in character,\nwhich humans have fixated in the case of correctly classified characters. On\nthe other hand, when the focused regions are different for humans and deep\nnets, the characters are typically misclassified by the latter. Hence, we\npropose to use the visual fixation maps obtained from the eye-tracking\nexperiment as a supervisory input to align the model's focus on relevant\ncharacter regions.

User\ncentric intents provide an abstracted means of impacting the design,\nprovisioning, deployment and assurance of network infrastructure and services\nwith the help of service level agreements and minimum network capability\nexposure. The concept of Intent-based networking (IBN) poses several challenges\nin terms of the contextual definition of intents, role of different\nstakeholders, and a generalized architecture. In this review, we provide a\ncomprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art in IBN including the intent\ndescription models, intent lifecycle management, significance of IBN and a\ngeneralized architectural framework along with challenges and prospects for IBN\nin future networks. An analytical study is performed on the data collected from\nrelevant studies primarily focusing on the inter-working of IBN with\nsoftwarized networking based on NFV/SDN infrastructures. Critical functions\nrequired in the IBN management and service model design are explored with\ndifferent abstract modeling techniques and a converged architectural framework\nis proposed. The key findings include: 1) benefits and role of IBN in\nautonomous networking, 2) improvements needed to integrate intents as\nfundamental policies for service modeling and network management, 3) need for\nappropriate representation models for intents in domain agnostic abstract\nmanner, and 4) need to include learning as a fundamental function in autonomous\nnetworks.

To address\nthese challenges, advanced multiple access schemes are expected to be\ndeveloped, namely next generation multiple access (NGMA), which are capable of\nsupporting massive numbers of users in a more resource- and\ncomplexity-efficient manner than existing multiple access schemes. As the\nresearch on NGMA is in a very early stage, in this paper, we explore the\nevolution of NGMA with a particular focus on non-orthogonal multiple access\n(NOMA), i.e., the transition from NOMA to NGMA. In particular, we first review\nthe fundamental capacity limits of NOMA, elaborate the new requirements for\nNGMA, and discuss several possible candidate techniques. Moreover, given the\nhigh compatibility and flexibility of NOMA, we provide an overview of current\nresearch efforts on multi-antenna techniques for NOMA, promising future\napplication scenarios of NOMA, and the interplay between NOMA and other\nemerging physical layer techniques. Furthermore, we discuss advanced\nmathematical tools for facilitating the design of NOMA communication systems,\nincluding conventional optimization approaches and new machine learning\ntechniques. Next, we propose a unified framework for NGMA based on multiple\nantennas and NOMA, where both downlink and uplink transmission are considered,\nthus setting the foundation for this emerging research area.

To separate security-sensitive operations from software executing\non the main x86 cores, SEV leverages the AMD Secure Processor (AMD-SP). This\npaper introduces a new approach to attack SEV-protected virtual machines (VMs)\nby targeting the AMD-SP. We present a voltage glitching attack that allows an\nattacker to execute custom payloads on the AMD-SPs of all microarchitectures\nthat support SEV currently on the market (Zen 1, Zen 2, and Zen 3). The\npresented methods allow us to deploy a custom SEV firmware on the AMD-SP, which\nenables an adversary to decrypt a VM's memory. Furthermore, using our approach,\nwe can extract endorsement keys of SEV-enabled CPUs, which allows us to fake\nattestation reports or to pose as a valid target for VM migration without\nrequiring physical access to the target host. Moreover, we reverse-engineered\nthe Versioned Chip Endorsement Key (VCEK) mechanism introduced with SEV Secure\nNested Paging (SEV-SNP). The VCEK binds the endorsement keys to the firmware\nversion of TCB components relevant for SEV. Building on the ability to extract\nthe endorsement keys, we show how to derive valid VCEKs for arbitrary firmware\nversions.

Making sure that all stakeholders\nshare the same vision of a changing system is crucial to the success of any\nproject.

A promising approach to this problem is the use of video showing\na system vision, so-called vision videos, which help stakeholders to disclose,\ndiscuss, and align their mental models of the future system. However, videos\nhave the drawback of allowing viewers to adopt a passive role, as has been\nshown in research on e-learning. In this role, viewers tend to be inactive,\nunfocused and bored while watching a video. In this paper, we learn and adopt\nfindings from scientific literature in the field of e-learning on how to\nmitigate this passive role while watching vision videos in requirements\nengineering. In this way, we developed concepts that incorporate interactive\nelements into vision videos to help viewers stay focused.

This knowledge is difficult to formulate and balance when\noperational routing decisions have to be made. This motivates us to learn the\nimplicit preferences from past solutions and to incorporate these learned\npreferences in the optimization process. These preferences are in the form of\narc probabilities, i.e., the more preferred a route is, the higher is the joint\nprobability. The novelty of this work is the use of a neural network model to\nestimate the arc probabilities, which allows for additional features and\nautomatic parameter estimation. This first requires identifying suitable\nfeatures, neural architectures and loss functions, taking into account that\nthere is typically few data available.

    "abstract": "Scene understanding is crucial for autonomous systems which intend to operate\nin the real world. Single task vision networks extract information only based\non some aspects of the scene. In multi-task learning (MTL), on the other hand,\nthese single tasks are jointly learned, thereby providing an opportunity for\ntasks to share information and obtain a more comprehensive understanding. To\nthis end, we develop UniNet, a unified scene understanding network that\naccurately and efficiently infers vital vision tasks including object\ndetection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, monocular depth\nestimation, and monocular instance depth prediction. As these tasks look at\ndifferent semantic and geometric information, they can either complement or\nconflict with each other. Therefore, understanding inter-task relationships can\nprovide useful cues to enable complementary information sharing. We evaluate\nthe task relationships in UniNet through the lens of adversarial attacks based\non the notion that they can exploit learned biases and task interactions in the\nneural network. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes dataset, using\nuntargeted and targeted attacks reveal that semantic tasks strongly interact\namongst themselves, and the same holds for geometric tasks. Additionally, we\nshow that the relationship between semantic and geometric tasks is asymmetric\nand their interaction becomes weaker as we move towards higher-level\nrepresentations.",

    "abstract": "An algebraic modeling system (AMS) is a type of mathematical software for\noptimization problems, which allows users to define symbolic mathematical\nmodels in a specific language, instantiate them with given source of data, and\nsolve them with the aid of external solver engines. With the bursting scale of\nbusiness models and increasing need for timeliness, traditional AMSs are not\nsufficient to meet the following industry needs: 1) million-variable models\nneed to be instantiated from raw data very efficiently; 2) Strictly feasible\nsolution of million-variable models need to be delivered in a rapid manner to\nmake up-to-date decisions against highly dynamic environments. Grassland is a\nrapid AMS that provides an end-to-end solution to tackle these emerged new\nchallenges. It integrates a parallelized instantiation scheme for large-scale\nlinear constraints, and a sequential decomposition method that accelerates\nmodel solving exponentially with an acceptable loss of optimality. Extensive\nbenchmarks on both classical models and real enterprise scenario demonstrate 6\n~ 10x speedup of Grassland over state-of-the-art solutions on model\ninstantiation. Our proposed system has been deployed in the large-scale real\nproduction planning scenario of Huawei.

    "title": "Refactoring the Whitby Intelligent Tutoring System for Clean  Architecture",
    "abstract": "Whitby is the server-side of an Intelligent Tutoring System application for\nlearning System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), a methodology used to ensure\nthe safety of anything that can be represented with a systems model. The\nunderlying logic driving the reasoning behind Whitby is Situation Calculus,\nwhich is a many-sorted logic with situation, action, and object sorts. The\nSituation Calculus is applied to Ontology Authoring and Contingent Scaffolding:\nthe primary activities within Whitby. Thus many fluents and actions are\naggregated in Whitby from these two sub-applications and from Whitby itself,\nbut all are available through a common situation query interface that does not\ndepend upon any of the fluents or actions. Each STPA project in Whitby is a\nsingle situation term, which is queried for fluents that include the ontology,\nand to determine what pedagogical interventions to offer.\nInitially Whitby was written in Prolog using a module system. In the interest\nof a cleaner architecture and implementation with improved code reuse and\nextensibility, the initial application was refactored into Logtalk. This\nrefactoring includes decoupling the Situation Calculus reasoner, Ontology\nAuthoring framework, and Contingent Scaffolding framework into third-party\nlibraries that can be reused in other applications. This extraction was\nachieved by inverting dependencies via Logtalk protocols and categories, which\nare reusable interfaces and components that provide functionally cohesive sets\nof predicate declarations and predicate definitions. In this paper the\narchitectures of two iterations of Whitby are evaluated with respect to the\nmotivations behind the refactor: clean architecture enabling code reuse and\nextensibility.",

    "abstract": "As the field of machine learning for combinatorial optimization advances,\ntraditional problems are resurfaced and readdressed through this new\nperspective. The overwhelming majority of the literature focuses on small graph\nproblems, while several real-world problems are devoted to large graphs. Here,\nwe focus on two such problems that are related: influence estimation, a\n\\#P-hard counting problem, and influence maximization, an NP-hard problem. We\ndevelop GLIE, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that inherently parameterizes an\nupper bound of influence estimation and train it on small simulated graphs.\nExperiments show that GLIE can provide accurate predictions faster than the\nalternatives for graphs 10 times larger than the train set. More importantly,\nit can be used on arbitrary large graphs for influence maximization, as the\npredictions can rank effectively seed sets even when the accuracy deteriorates.\nTo showcase this, we propose a version of a standard Influence Maximization\n(IM) algorithm where we substitute traditional influence estimation with the\npredictions of GLIE.We also transfer GLIE into a reinforcement learning model\nthat learns how to choose seeds to maximize influence sequentially using GLIE's\nhidden representations and predictions. The final results show that the\nproposed methods surpasses a previous GNN-RL approach and perform on par with a\nstate-of-the-art IM algorithm.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel framework for fine-grained object recognition that learns\nto recover object variation in 3D space from a single image, trained on an\nimage collection without using any ground-truth 3D annotation. We accomplish\nthis by representing an object as a composition of 3D shape and its appearance,\nwhile eliminating the effect of camera viewpoint, in a canonical configuration.\nUnlike conventional methods modeling spatial variation in 2D images only, our\nmethod is capable of reconfiguring the appearance feature in a canonical 3D\nspace, thus enabling the subsequent object classifier to be invariant under 3D\ngeometric variation. Our representation also allows us to go beyond existing\nmethods, by incorporating 3D shape variation as an additional cue for object\nrecognition. To learn the model without ground-truth 3D annotation, we deploy a\ndifferentiable renderer in an analysis-by-synthesis framework. By incorporating\n3D shape and appearance jointly in a deep representation, our method learns the\ndiscriminative representation of the object and achieves competitive\nperformance on fine-grained image recognition and vehicle re-identification. We\nalso demonstrate that the performance of 3D shape reconstruction is improved by\nlearning fine-grained shape deformation in a boosting manner.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are used by autonomous\nvehicles to communicate with surrounding autonomous vehicles and roadside units\n(RSU). Current C-ITS applications focus primarily on real-time information\nsharing, such as cooperative perception. In addition to real-time information\nsharing, self-driving cars need to coordinate their action plans to achieve\nhigher safety and efficiency. For this reason, this study defines a vehicle's\nfuture action plan/path and designs a cooperative path-planning model at\nintersections using future path sharing based on the future path information of\nmultiple vehicles. The notion is that when the RSU detects a potential conflict\nof vehicle paths or an acceleration opportunity according to the shared future\npaths, it will generate a coordinated path update that adjusts the speeds of\nthe vehicles. We implemented the proposed method using the open-source Autoware\nautonomous driving software and evaluated it with the LGSVL autonomous vehicle\nsimulator. We conducted simulation experiments with two vehicles at a blind\nintersection scenario, finding that each car can travel safely and more\nefficiently by planning a path that reflects the action plans of all vehicles\ninvolved. The time consumed by introducing the RSU is 23.0 % and 28.1 % shorter\nthan that of the stand-alone autonomous driving case at the intersection.",

Test smells have a detrimental effect not only on test\ncode but also on the production code that is being tested. To date, the\nmajority of the research on test smells has been focusing on programming\nlanguages such as Java and Scala. However, there are no available automated\ntools to support the identification of test smells for Python, despite its\nrapid growth in popularity in recent years. In this paper, we strive to extend\nthe research to Python, build a tool for detecting test smells in this\nlanguage, and conduct an empirical analysis of test smells in Python projects.\nWe started by gathering a list of test smells from existing research and\nselecting test smells that can be considered language-agnostic or have similar\nfunctionality in Python's standard Unittest framework. In total, we identified\n17 diverse test smells. Additionally, we searched for Python-specific test\nsmells by mining frequent code change patterns that can be considered as either\nfixing or introducing test smells. Based on these changes, we proposed our own\ntest smell called Suboptimal assert. To detect all these test smells, we\ndeveloped a tool called PyNose in the form of a plugin to PyCharm, a popular\nPython IDE. Finally, we conducted a large-scale empirical investigation aimed\nat analyzing the prevalence of test smells in Python code. Our results show\nthat 98% of the projects and 84% of the test suites in the studied dataset\ncontain at least one test smell.

A large-scale food logo\ndataset is urgently needed for developing advanced food logo detection\nalgorithms. However, there are no available food logo datasets with food brand\ninformation. To support efforts towards food logo detection, we introduce the\ndataset FoodLogoDet-1500, a new large-scale publicly available food logo\ndataset, which has 1,500 categories, about 100,000 images and about 150,000\nmanually annotated food logo objects.

To the best of our knowledge, FoodLogoDet-1500 is the\nfirst largest publicly available high-quality dataset for food logo detection.\nThe challenge of food logo detection lies in the large-scale categories and\nsimilarities between food logo categories. For that, we propose a novel food\nlogo detection method Multi-scale Feature Decoupling Network (MFDNet), which\ndecouples classification and regression into two branches and focuses on the\nclassification branch to solve the problem of distinguishing multiple food logo\ncategories. Specifically, we introduce the feature offset module, which\nutilizes the deformation-learning for optimal classification offset and can\neffectively obtain the most representative features of classification in\ndetection. In addition, we adopt a balanced feature pyramid in MFDNet, which\npays attention to global information, balances the multi-scale feature maps,\nand enhances feature extraction capability. Comprehensive experiments on\nFoodLogoDet-1500 and other two benchmark logo datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. The FoodLogoDet-1500 can be found at this\nhttps URL.",

In Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), openly providing\nresearch artifacts plays a key role, even more so as the community targets a\nbroader use of AI techniques, which can only become feasible if large open\ndatasets and confidence measures for their quality are available. However, the\ncurrent lack of common discipline-specific guidelines for research data sharing\nopens the opportunity for misunderstandings about the true potential of\nresearch artifacts and subjective expectations regarding artifact quality. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a set of guidelines for artifact sharing\nspecifically tailored to MDE research. To design this guidelines set, we\nsystematically analyzed general-purpose artifact sharing practices of major\ncomputer science venues and tailored them to the MDE domain. Subsequently, we\nconducted an online survey with 90 researchers and practitioners with expertise\nin MDE. We investigated our participants' experiences in developing and sharing\nartifacts in MDE research and the challenges encountered while doing so. We\nthen asked them to prioritize each of our guidelines as essential, desirable,\nor unnecessary. Finally, we asked them to evaluate our guidelines with respect\nto clarity, completeness, and relevance.

    "title": "U-Net-and-a-half: Convolutional network for biomedical image  segmentation using multiple expert-driven annotations",
    "abstract": "Development of deep learning systems for biomedical segmentation often\nrequires access to expert-driven, manually annotated datasets. If more than a\nsingle expert is involved in the annotation of the same images, then the\ninter-expert agreement is not necessarily perfect, and no single expert\nannotation can precisely capture the so-called ground truth of the regions of\ninterest on all images. Also, it is not trivial to generate a reference\nestimate using annotations from multiple experts. Here we present a deep neural\nnetwork, defined as U-Net-and-a-half, which can simultaneously learn from\nannotations performed by multiple experts on the same set of images.\nU-Net-and-a-half contains a convolutional encoder to generate features from the\ninput images, multiple decoders that allow simultaneous learning from image\nmasks obtained from annotations that were independently generated by multiple\nexperts, and a shared low-dimensional feature space. To demonstrate the\napplicability of our framework, we used two distinct datasets from digital\npathology and radiology, respectively. Specifically, we trained two separate\nmodels using pathologist-driven annotations of glomeruli on whole slide images\nof human kidney biopsies (10 patients), and radiologist-driven annotations of\nlumen cross-sections of human arteriovenous fistulae obtained from\nintravascular ultrasound images (10 patients), respectively. The models based\non U-Net-and-a-half exceeded the performance of the traditional U-Net models\ntrained on single expert annotations alone, thus expanding the scope of\nmultitask learning in the context of biomedical image segmentation.",

This metric is an\nindication of a deeper problem lies within the code and is associated with an\nissue which is prominent to experienced software developers with acceptable\ncoding practices. Recent studies have often observed that codes having code\nsmells are often prone to a higher probability of change in the software\ndevelopment cycle. In this paper, we developed code smell prediction models\nwith the help of features extracted from source code to predict eight types of\ncode smell. Our work also presents the application of data sampling techniques\nto handle class imbalance problem and feature selection techniques to find\nrelevant feature sets. Previous studies had made use of techniques such as\nNaive - Bayes and Random forest but had not explored deep learning methods to\npredict code smell. A total of 576 distinct Deep Learning models were trained\nusing the features and datasets mentioned above. The study concluded that the\ndeep learning models which used data from Synthetic Minority Oversampling\nTechnique gave better results in terms of accuracy, AUC with the accuracy of\nsome models improving from 88.47 to 96.84.",

    "abstract": "Recommendation for new users, also called user cold start, has been a\nwell-recognized challenge for online recommender systems. Most existing methods\nview the crux as the lack of initial data. However, in this paper, we argue\nthat there are neglected problems: 1) New users' behaviour follows much\ndifferent distributions from regular users. 2) Although personalized features\nare involved, heavily imbalanced samples prevent the model from balancing\nnew/regular user distributions, as if the personalized features are\noverwhelmed. We name the problem as the ``submergence\" of personalization. To\ntackle this problem, we propose a novel module: Personalized COld Start MOdules\n(POSO). Considering from a model architecture perspective, POSO personalizes\nexisting modules by introducing multiple user-group-specialized sub-modules.\nThen, it fuses their outputs by personalized gates, resulting in comprehensive\nrepresentations. In such way, POSO projects imbalanced features to even\nmodules. POSO can be flexibly integrated into many existing modules and\neffectively improves their performance with negligible computational overheads.\nThe proposed method shows remarkable advantage in industrial scenario. It has\nbeen deployed on the large-scale recommender system of Kwai, and improves new\nuser Watch Time by a large margin (+7.75%). Moreover, POSO can be further\ngeneralized to regular users, inactive users and returning users (+2%-3% on\nWatch Time), as well as item cold start (+3.8% on Watch Time). Its\neffectiveness has also been verified on public dataset (MovieLens 20M). We\nbelieve such practical experience can be well generalized to other scenarios.",

    "title": "Multi-Camera Trajectory Forecasting with Trajectory Tensors",
    "abstract": "We introduce the problem of multi-camera trajectory forecasting (MCTF), which\ninvolves predicting the trajectory of a moving object across a network of\ncameras. While multi-camera setups are widespread for applications such as\nsurveillance and traffic monitoring, existing trajectory forecasting methods\ntypically focus on single-camera trajectory forecasting (SCTF), limiting their\nuse for such applications. Furthermore, using a single camera limits the\nfield-of-view available, making long-term trajectory forecasting impossible. We\naddress these shortcomings of SCTF by developing an MCTF framework that\nsimultaneously uses all estimated relative object locations from several\nviewpoints and predicts the object's future location in all possible\nviewpoints. Our framework follows a Which-When-Where approach that predicts in\nwhich camera(s) the objects appear and when and where within the camera views\nthey appear. To this end, we propose the concept of trajectory tensors: a new\ntechnique to encode trajectories across multiple camera views and the\nassociated uncertainties. We develop several encoder-decoder MCTF models for\ntrajectory tensors and present extensive experiments on our own database\n(comprising 600 hours of video data from 15 camera views) created particularly\nfor the MCTF task. Results show that our trajectory tensor models outperform\ncoordinate trajectory-based MCTF models and existing SCTF methods adapted for\nMCTF.

The mode as well as other high probability\ntranslations found by beam search have been shown to often be inadequate in a\nnumber of ways. This prevents practitioners from improving translation quality\nthrough better search, as these idiosyncratic translations end up being\nselected by the decoding algorithm, a problem known as the beam search curse.\nRecently, a sampling-based approximation to minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding\nhas been proposed as an alternative decision rule for NMT that would likely not\nsuffer from the same problems. We analyse this approximation and establish that\nit has no equivalent to the beam search curse, i.e. better search always leads\nto better translations. We also design different approximations aimed at\ndecoupling the cost of exploration from the cost of robust estimation of\nexpected utility. This allows for exploration of much larger hypothesis spaces,\nwhich we show to be beneficial. We also show that it can be beneficial to make\nuse of strategies like beam search and nucleus sampling to construct hypothesis\nspaces efficiently.

To enhance\nprivacy, gradient perturbation techniques have been proposed. However, they\ncome at the cost of reduced model performance, increased convergence time, or\nincreased data demand. In this paper, we introduce PRECODE, a PRivacy EnhanCing\nmODulE that can be used as generic extension for arbitrary model architectures.\nWe propose a simple yet effective realization of PRECODE using variational\nmodeling. The stochastic sampling induced by variational modeling effectively\nprevents privacy leakage from gradients and in turn preserves privacy of data\nowners. We evaluate PRECODE using state of the art gradient inversion attacks\non two different model architectures trained on three datasets. In contrast to\ncommonly used defense mechanisms, we find that our proposed modification\nconsistently reduces the attack success rate to 0% while having almost no\nnegative impact on model training and final performance.

    "title": "A Linear Programming Approach to the Minimum Cost Sparsest Input  Selection for Structured Systems",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider three related cost-sparsity induced optimal input\nselection problems for structural controllability using a unifying linear\nprogramming (LP) framework. More precisely, given an autonomous system and a\nconstrained input configuration where whether an input can directly actuate a\nstate variable, as well as the corresponding (possibly different) cost, is\nprescribed, the problems are, respectively, selecting the minimum number of\ninput links, selecting the minimum cost of input links, and selecting the input\nlinks with the cost as small as possible while their cardinality is not\nexceeding a prescribed number, all to ensure structural controllability of the\nresulting systems. Current studies show that in the dedicated input case (i.e.,\neach input can actuate only a state variable), the first and second problems\nare polynomially solvable by some graph-theoretic algorithms, while the general\nnontrivial constrained case is largely unexploited. In this paper, we formulate\nthese problems as equivalent integer linear programming (ILP) problems. Under a\nweaker constraint on the prescribed input configurations than most of the\ncurrently known ones with which the first two problems are reportedly\npolynomially solvable, we show these ILPs can be solved by simply removing the\ninteger constraints and solving the corresponding LP problems, thus providing a\nunifying algebraic method, rather than graph-theoretic, for these problems with\npolynomial time complexity. The key to our approach is the observation that the\nrespective constraint matrices of the ILPs are totally unimodular.",

    "abstract": "A multi-user fog radio access network (F-RAN) is designed for supporting\ncontent-centric services. The requested contents are partitioned into\nsub-contents, which are then 'beam- formed' by the remote radio heads (RRHs)\nfor transmission to the users. Since a large number of beamformers must be\ndesigned, this poses a computational challenge. We tackle this challenge by\nproposing a new class of regularized zero forcing beamforming (RZFB) for\ndirectly mitigating the inter-content interferences, while the 'intra-content\ninterference' is mitigated by successive interference cancellation at the user\nend. Thus each beamformer is decided by a single real variable (for proper\nGaus- sian signaling) or by a pair of complex variables (for improper Gaussian\nsignaling). Hence the total number of decision variables is substantially\nreduced to facilitate tractable computation. To address the problem of energy\nefficiency optimization subject to multiple constraints, such as individual\nuser-rate requirement and the fronthauling constraint of the links between the\nRRHs and the centralized baseband signal processing unit, as well as the total\ntransmit power budget, we develop low-complexity path- following algorithms.\nFinally, we actualize their performance by simulations.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the movement trajectories of multiple classes of road users in\nreal-world scenarios is a challenging task due to the diverse trajectory\npatterns. While recent works of pedestrian trajectory prediction successfully\nmodelled the influence of surrounding neighbours based on the relative\ndistances, they are ineffective on multi-class trajectory prediction. This is\nbecause they ignore the impact of the implicit correlations between different\ntypes of road users on the trajectory to be predicted - for example, a nearby\npedestrian has a different level of influence from a nearby car. In this paper,\nwe propose to introduce class information into a graph convolutional neural\nnetwork to better predict the trajectory of an individual. We embed the class\nlabels of the surrounding objects into the label adjacency matrix (LAM), which\nis combined with the velocity-based adjacency matrix (VAM) comprised of the\nobjects' velocity, thereby generating a semantics-guided graph adjacency (SAM).\nSAM effectively models semantic information with trainable parameters to\nautomatically learn the embedded label features that will contribute to the\nfixed velocity-based trajectory. Such information of spatial and temporal\ndependencies is passed to a graph convolutional and temporal convolutional\nnetwork to estimate the predicted trajectory distributions. We further propose\nnew metrics, known as Average2 Displacement Error (aADE) and Average Final\nDisplacement Error (aFDE), that assess network accuracy more accurately. We\ncall our framework Semantics-STGCNN. It consistently shows superior performance\nto the state-of-the-arts in existing and the newly proposed metrics.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing demands of personalized learning, knowledge tracing has\nbecome important which traces students' knowledge states based on their\nhistorical practices. Factor analysis methods mainly use two kinds of factors\nwhich are separately related to students and questions to model students'\nknowledge states. These methods use the total number of attempts of students to\nmodel students' learning progress and hardly highlight the impact of the most\nrecent relevant practices. Besides, current factor analysis methods ignore rich\ninformation contained in questions. In this paper, we propose Multi-Factors\nAware Dual-Attentional model (MF-DAKT) which enriches question representations\nand utilizes multiple factors to model students' learning progress based on a\ndual-attentional mechanism. More specifically, we propose a novel\nstudent-related factor which records the most recent attempts on relevant\nconcepts of students to highlight the impact of recent exercises. To enrich\nquestions representations, we use a pre-training method to incorporate two\nkinds of question information including questions' relation and difficulty\nlevel. We also add a regularization term about questions' difficulty level to\nrestrict pre-trained question representations to fine-tuning during the process\nof predicting students' performance. Moreover, we apply a dual-attentional\nmechanism to differentiate contributions of factors and factor interactions to\nfinal prediction in different practice records. At last, we conduct experiments\non several real-world datasets and results show that MF-DAKT can outperform\nexisting knowledge tracing methods. We also conduct several studies to validate\nthe effects of each component of MF-DAKT.",

We\nconstruct a model whereby two classes of objects follow an underlying Gaussian\ndistribution, and where the features (the input data) have varying, but known,\nlevels of noise. This model mimics the nature of scientific data sets, where\nthe noises arise as realizations of some random processes whose underlying\ndistributions are known. The classification of these objects can then be\nperformed using standard statistical techniques (e.g., least-squares\nminimization or Markov-Chain Monte Carlo), as well as ML techniques. This\nallows us to take advantage of a maximum likelihood approach to object\nclassification, and to measure the amount by which the ML methods are\nincorporating the information in the input data uncertainties. We show that,\nwhen each data point is subject to different levels of noise (i.e., noises with\ndifferent distribution functions), that information can be learned by the CNNs,\nraising the ML performance to at least the same level of the least-squares\nmethod -- and sometimes even surpassing it.

There appear inner neurons performing a logical\nwork, making intermediary proposition, for instance E V EH. Then, we remarked\nthat adding a second hidden layer and choosing a symmetric metric for learning,\nthe activities of the neurons become almost quantized and more informative.\nUsing the work of Carnap and Bar-Hillel 1952, we define a measure of the\nlogical value for collections of such cells. The logical score growths with the\ndepth of the layer, i.e. the information on the output decision increases,\nwhich confirms a kind of bottleneck principle. Then we study a bit more complex\ntasks, a priori involving predicate logic. We compare the logic and the\nmeasured weights. This shows, for groups of neurons, a neat correlation between\nthe logical score and the size of the weights. It exhibits a form of sparsity\nbetween the layers.

We demonstrate how we\ncan achieve uniqueness discovery, data masking, differential privacy and\nk-anonymity over encrypted data requiring zero knowledge about the original\nvalues. We prove that the security protocols followed by our approach provide\nstrong guarantees against inference attacks. Finally, we experimentally\ndemonstrate the performance of our data publishing workflow components.",

    "title": "Data-Driven Abductive Inference of Library Specifications",
    "abstract": "Programmers often leverage data structure libraries that provide useful and\nreusable abstractions. Modular verification of programs that make use of these\nlibraries naturally rely on specifications that capture important properties\nabout how the library expects these data structures to be accessed and\nmanipulated. However, these specifications are often missing or incomplete,\nmaking it hard for clients to be confident they are using the library safely.\nWhen library source code is also unavailable, as is often the case, the\nchallenge to infer meaningful specifications is further exacerbated. In this\npaper, we present a novel data-driven abductive inference mechanism that infers\nspecifications for library methods sufficient to enable verification of the\nlibrary's clients. Our technique combines a data-driven learning-based\nframework to postulate candidate specifications, along with SMT-provided\ncounterexamples to refine these candidates, taking special care to prevent\ngenerating specifications that overfit to sampled tests. The resulting\nspecifications form a minimal set of requirements on the behavior of library\nimplementations that ensures safety of a particular client program. Our\nsolution thus provides a new multi-abduction procedure for precise\nspecification inference of data structure libraries guided by client-side\nverification tasks. Experimental results on a wide range of realistic OCaml\ndata structure programs demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",

Deep complex networks (DCN), in\ncontrast, can learn from complex data, but have high computational costs;\ntherefore, they cannot satisfy the instant decision-making requirements of many\ndeployable systems dealing with short observations or short signal bursts.\nRecent, Binarized Complex Neural Network (BCNN), which integrates DCNs with\nbinarized neural networks (BNN), shows great potential in classifying complex\ndata in real-time. In this paper, we propose a structural pruning based\naccelerator of BCNN, which is able to provide more than 5000 frames/s inference\nthroughput on edge devices. The high performance comes from both the algorithm\nand hardware sides. On the algorithm side, we conduct structural pruning to the\noriginal BCNN models and obtain 20 $\\times$ pruning rates with negligible\naccuracy loss; on the hardware side, we propose a novel 2D convolution\noperation accelerator for the binary complex neural network.

    "abstract": "Analysing correlations between streams of events is an important problem. It\narises for example in Neurosciences, when the connectivity of neurons should be\ninferred from spike trains that record neurons' individual spiking activity.\nWhile recently some approaches for inferring delayed synaptic connections have\nbeen proposed, they are limited in the types of connectivities and delays they\nare able to handle, or require computation-intensive procedures. This paper\nproposes a faster and more flexible approach for analysing such delayed\ncorrelated activity: a statistical approach for the Analysis of Connectivity in\nspiking Events (ACE), based on the idea of hypothesis testing. It first\ncomputes for any pair of a source and a target neuron the inter-spike delays\nbetween subsequent source- and target-spikes. Then, it derives a null model for\nthe distribution of inter-spike delays for \\emph{uncorrelated}~neurons.\nFinally, it compares the observed distribution of inter-spike delays to this\nnull model and infers pairwise connectivity based on the Pearson's Chi-squared\ntest statistic. Thus, ACE is capable to detect connections with a priori\nunknown, non-discrete (and potentially large) inter-spike delays, which might\nvary between pairs of neurons. Since ACE works incrementally, it has potential\nfor being used in online processing. In our experiments, we visualise the\nadvantages of ACE in varying experimental scenarios (except for one special\ncase) and in a state-of-the-art dataset which has been generated for\nneuro-scientific research under most realistic conditions.",

    "abstract": "The omnipresence of IoT devices in Industry 4.0 is expected to foster higher\nreliability, safety, and efficiency. However, interconnecting a large number of\nwireless devices without jeopardizing the system performance proves\nchallenging. To address the requirements of future industries, we investigate\nthe cross-layer design of beamforming and scheduling for layered-division\nmultiplexing (LDM) systems in millimeter-wave bands. Scheduling is crucial as\nthe devices in industrial settings are expected to proliferate rapidly. Also,\nhighly performant beamforming is necessary to ensure scalability. By adopting\nLDM, multiple transmissions can be non-orthogonally superimposed. Specifically,\nwe consider a superior-importance control multicast message required to be\nubiquitous to all devices and inferior-importance private unicast messages\ntargeting a subset of scheduled devices. Due to NP-hardness, we propose\nBEAMWAVE, which decomposes the problem into beamforming and scheduling. Through\nsimulations, we show that BEAMWAVE attains near-optimality and outperforms\nother competing schemes.",

    "abstract": "The widely used 'Counterfactual' definition of Causal Effects was derived for\nunbiasedness and accuracy - and not generalizability. We propose a simple\ndefinition for the External Validity (EV) of Interventions, Counterfactual\nstatements and Samples. We use the definition to discuss several issues that\nhave baffled the counterfactual approach to effect estimation: out-of-sample\nvalidity, reliance on independence assumptions or estimation, concurrent\nestimation of many effects and full-models, bias-variance tradeoffs,\nstatistical power, omitted variables, and connections to supervised and\nexplaining techniques. Methodologically, the definition also allow us to\nreplace the parametric and generally ill-posed estimation problems that\nfollowed the counterfactual definition by combinatorial enumeration problems on\nnon-experimental samples. We use over 20 contemporary methods and simulations\nto demonstrate that the approach leads to accuracy gains in standard\nout-of-sample prediction, intervention effect prediction and causal effect\nestimation tasks. The COVID19 pandemic highlighted the need for learning\nsolutions to provide general predictions in small samples - many times with\nmissing variables.

    "abstract": "The CP decomposition for high dimensional non-orthogonal spike tensors is an\nimportant problem with broad applications across many disciplines. However,\nprevious works with theoretical guarantee typically assume restrictive\nincoherence conditions on the basis vectors for the CP components. In this\npaper, we propose new computationally efficient composite PCA and concurrent\northogonalization algorithms for tensor CP decomposition with theoretical\nguarantees under mild incoherence conditions. The composite PCA applies the\nprincipal component or singular value decompositions twice, first to a matrix\nunfolding of the tensor data to obtain singular vectors and then to the matrix\nfolding of the singular vectors obtained in the first step. It can be used as\nan initialization for any iterative optimization schemes for the tensor CP\ndecomposition. The concurrent orthogonalization algorithm iteratively estimates\nthe basis vector in each mode of the tensor by simultaneously applying\nprojections to the orthogonal complements of the spaces generated by others CP\ncomponents in other modes. It is designed to improve the alternating least\nsquares estimator and other forms of the high order orthogonal iteration for\ntensors with low or moderately high CP ranks. Our theoretical investigation\nprovides estimation accuracy and statistical convergence rates for the two\nproposed algorithms.

Despite the great success of GD type optimization methods in\nnumerical simulations for the training of ANNs with ReLU activation, it remains\n- even in the simplest situation of the plain vanilla GD optimization method\nwith random initializations and ANNs with one hidden layer - an open problem to\nprove (or disprove) the conjecture that the risk of the GD optimization method\nconverges in the training of such ANNs to zero as the width of the ANNs, the\nnumber of independent random initializations, and the number of GD steps\nincrease to infinity.

However, the accuracy of manual classification of those\nhistopathological images is comparatively low. This research aims to increase\nthe accuracy of the classification of breast cancer images by utilizing a\nPatch-Based Classifier (PBC) along with deep learning architecture.\nMethodology: The proposed system consists of a Deep Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (DCNN) that helps in enhancing and increasing the accuracy of the\nclassification process. This is done by the use of the Patch-based Classifier\n(PBC). CNN has completely different layers where images are first fed through\nconvolutional layers using hyperbolic tangent function together with the\nmax-pooling layer, drop out layers, and SoftMax function for classification.\nFurther, the output obtained is fed to a patch-based classifier that consists\nof patch-wise classification output followed by majority voting. Results: The\nresults are obtained throughout the classification stage for breast cancer\nimages that are collected from breast-histology datasets. The proposed solution\nimproves the accuracy of classification whether or not the images had normal,\nbenign, in-situ, or invasive carcinoma from 87% to 94% with a decrease in\nprocessing time from 0.45 s to 0.2s on average. Conclusion: The proposed\nsolution focused on increasing the accuracy of classifying cancer in the breast\nby enhancing the image contrast and reducing the vanishing gradient.

    "title": "Bandit Algorithms for Precision Medicine",
    "abstract": "The Oxford English Dictionary defines precision medicine as \"medical care\ndesigned to optimize efficiency or therapeutic benefit for particular groups of\npatients, especially by using genetic or molecular profiling.\" It is not an\nentirely new idea: physicians from ancient times have recognized that medical\ntreatment needs to consider individual variations in patient characteristics.\nHowever, the modern precision medicine movement has been enabled by a\nconfluence of events: scientific advances in fields such as genetics and\npharmacology, technological advances in mobile devices and wearable sensors,\nand methodological advances in computing and data sciences.\nThis chapter is about bandit algorithms: an area of data science of special\nrelevance to precision medicine. With their roots in the seminal work of\nBellman, Robbins, Lai and others, bandit algorithms have come to occupy a\ncentral place in modern data science ( Lattimore and Szepesvari, 2020). Bandit\nalgorithms can be used in any situation where treatment decisions need to be\nmade to optimize some health outcome. Since precision medicine focuses on the\nuse of patient characteristics to guide treatment, contextual bandit algorithms\nare especially useful since they are designed to take such information into\naccount. The role of bandit algorithms in areas of precision medicine such as\nmobile health and digital phenotyping has been reviewed before (Tewari and\nMurphy, 2017; Rabbi et al., 2019). Since these reviews were published, bandit\nalgorithms have continued to find uses in mobile health and several new topics\nhave emerged in the research on bandit algorithms. This chapter is written for\nquantitative researchers in fields such as statistics, machine learning, and\noperations research who might be interested in knowing more about the\nalgorithmic and mathematical details of bandit algorithms that have been used\nin mobile health.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the random graph $\\mathcal{P}(n,q)$ which results from taking\nthe union of two paths of length $n\\geq 1$, where the vertices of one of the\npaths have been relabelled according to a Mallows permutation with real\nparameter $0<q(n)\\leq 1$. This random graph model, the tangled path, goes\nthrough an evolution: if $q$ is close to $0$ the graph bears resemblance to a\npath and as $q$ tends to $1$ it becomes an expander. In an effort to understand\nthe evolution of $\\mathcal{P}(n,q)$ we determine the treewidth and cutwidth of\n$\\mathcal{P}(n,q)$ up to log factors for all $q$. We also show that the\nproperty of having a separator of size one has a sharp threshold. In addition,\nwe prove bounds on the diameter, and vertex isoperimetric number for specific\nvalues of $q$.",

    "title": "Effects of sampling and horizon in predictive reinforcement learning",
    "abstract": "Plain reinforcement learning (RL) may be prone to loss of convergence,\nconstraint violation, unexpected performance, etc. Commonly, RL agents undergo\nextensive learning stages to achieve acceptable functionality. This is in\ncontrast to classical control algorithms which are typically model-based. An\ndirection of research is the fusion of RL with such algorithms, especially\nmodel-predictive control (MPC). This, however, introduces new hyper-parameters\nrelated to the prediction horizon. Furthermore, RL is usually concerned with\nMarkov decision processes. But the most of the real environments are not\ntime-discrete. The factual physical setting of RL consists of a digital agent\nand a time-continuous dynamical system. There is thus, in fact, yet another\nhyper-parameter -- the agent sampling time. In this paper, we investigate the\neffects of prediction horizon and sampling of two hybrid RL-MPC-agents in a\ncase study with a mobile robot parking, which is in turn a canonical control\nproblem. We benchmark the agents with a simple variant of MPC. The sampling\nshowed a kind of a \"sweet spot\" behavior, whereas the RL agents demonstrated\nmerits at shorter horizons.",

    "abstract": "From ultra-sensitive detectors of fundamental forces to quantum networks and\nsensors, mechanical resonators are enabling next-generation technologies to\noperate in room temperature environments. Currently, silicon nitride\nnanoresonators stand as a leading microchip platform in these advances by\nallowing for mechanical resonators whose motion is remarkably isolated from\nambient thermal noise. However, to date, human intuition has remained the\ndriving force behind design processes. Here, inspired by nature and guided by\nmachine learning, a spiderweb nanomechanical resonator is developed that\nexhibits vibration modes which are isolated from ambient thermal environments\nvia a novel \"torsional soft-clamping\" mechanism discovered by the data-driven\noptimization algorithm. This bio-inspired resonator is then fabricated;\nexperimentally confirming a new paradigm in mechanics with quality factors\nabove 1 billion in room temperature environments. In contrast to other\nstate-of-the-art resonators, this milestone is achieved with a compact design\nwhich does not require sub-micron lithographic features or complex phononic\nbandgaps, making it significantly easier and cheaper to manufacture at large\nscales. Here we demonstrate the ability of machine learning to work in tandem\nwith human intuition to augment creative possibilities and uncover new\nstrategies in computing and nanotechnology.",
