    "abstract": "Deep learning based analysis of histopathology images shows promise in\nadvancing the understanding of tumor progression, tumor micro-environment, and\ntheir underpinning biological processes. So far, these approaches have focused\non extracting information associated with annotations. In this work, we ask how\nmuch information can be learned from the tissue architecture itself.\nWe present an adversarial learning model to extract feature representations\nof cancer tissue, without the need for manual annotations. We show that these\nrepresentations are able to identify a variety of morphological characteristics\nacross three cancer types: Breast, colon, and lung. This is supported by 1) the\nseparation of morphologic characteristics in the latent space; 2) the ability\nto classify tissue type with logistic regression using latent representations,\nwith an AUC of 0.97 and 85% accuracy, comparable to supervised deep models; 3)\nthe ability to predict the presence of tumor in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) using\nmultiple instance learning (MIL), achieving an AUC of 0.98 and 94% accuracy.\nOur results show that our model captures distinct phenotypic characteristics\nof real tissue samples, paving the way for further understanding of tumor\nprogression and tumor micro-environment, and ultimately refining\nhistopathological classification for diagnosis and treatment.

    "abstract": "In 21st century America, to many observers, the idea that 10's of millions of\nAmericans could lose power and heat for multiple days in the middle of a record\ncold snap, was unthinkable. It came as an even greater surprise that it would\nbe Texas - arguably one of the world's energy capitals - that failed to provide\nsufficient power to its residents. This paper explores the events that led to\nthe outage, the experiences of those who lived through it, and the situation in\nTexas one to two months after the event. We have taken an ethnographic approach\nto capture both the empirical aspects of the situation, and the more\ninterpretive descriptions of the accounts and thoughts of the participants. And\nfinally, we have tried to include enough information about the authors that\nyou, the reader, can interpret our descriptions within context and extract\nvalue relevant to your situation. We believe this ethnography of events in\nTexas can serve as foundational evidence and therefore can be generalized to a\nwide variety of situations and methodologies.",

    "abstract": "Expensive bounding-box annotations have limited the development of object\ndetection task. Thus, it is necessary to focus on more challenging task of\nfew-shot object detection. It requires the detector to recognize objects of\nnovel classes with only a few training samples. Nowadays, many existing popular\nmethods based on meta-learning have achieved promising performance, such as\nMeta R-CNN series. However, only a single category of support data is used as\nthe attention to guide the detecting of query images each time. Their relevance\nto each other remains unexploited. Moreover, a lot of recent works treat the\nsupport data and query images as independent branch without considering the\nrelationship between them. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic\nrelevance learning model, which utilizes the relationship between all support\nimages and Region of Interest (RoI) on the query images to construct a dynamic\ngraph convolutional network (GCN). By adjusting the prediction distribution of\nthe base detector using the output of this GCN, the proposed model can guide\nthe detector to improve the class representation implicitly. Comprehensive\nexperiments have been conducted on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO dataset. The proposed\nmodel achieves the best overall performance, which shows its effectiveness of\nlearning more generalized features.

    "title": "The Impact of Machine Learning on 2D/3D Registration for Image-guided  Interventions: A Systematic Review and Perspective",
    "abstract": "Image-based navigation is widely considered the next frontier of minimally\ninvasive surgery. It is believed that image-based navigation will increase the\naccess to reproducible, safe, and high-precision surgery as it may then be\nperformed at acceptable costs and effort. This is because image-based\ntechniques avoid the need of specialized equipment and seamlessly integrate\nwith contemporary workflows. Further, it is expected that image-based\nnavigation will play a major role in enabling mixed reality environments and\nautonomous, robotic workflows. A critical component of image guidance is 2D/3D\nregistration, a technique to estimate the spatial relationships between 3D\nstructures, e.g., volumetric imagery or tool models, and 2D images thereof,\nsuch as fluoroscopy or endoscopy. While image-based 2D/3D registration is a\nmature technique, its transition from the bench to the bedside has been\nrestrained by well-known challenges, including brittleness of the optimization\nobjective, hyperparameter selection, and initialization, difficulties around\ninconsistencies or multiple objects, and limited single-view performance. One\nreason these challenges persist today is that analytical solutions are likely\ninadequate considering the complexity, variability, and high-dimensionality of\ngeneric 2D/3D registration problems. The recent advent of machine\nlearning-based approaches to imaging problems that, rather than specifying the\ndesired functional mapping, approximate it using highly expressive parametric\nmodels holds promise for solving some of the notorious challenges in 2D/3D\nregistration. In this manuscript, we review the impact of machine learning on\n2D/3D registration to systematically summarize the recent advances made by\nintroduction of this novel technology. Grounded in these insights, we then\noffer our perspective on the most pressing needs, significant open problems,\nand possible next steps.",

It could be easily implemented on a single\napp screen, needing only some individual preferences to be set and a handful of\nadjustments to the particular scenario that shall be assessed. The disadvantage\nas of any simplified semi-quantitative risk models is that calibration is not\neasy (as some calibration points may even contradict) and that cumulative\neffects are hard to integrate e. g. the joint effect of combined scenarios.\nBut, in principle calibration is feasible and it may be a good decision to\ncalibrate the model conservatively.",

Previous advances in the material point method (MPM)\nled to a fast and simple, but potentially momentum violating, strategy for\nenforcing contact.

We propose a modified strategy which ensures\nconservation of both linear and angular momentum with a novel use of the affine\nparticle-in-cell (APIC) method. Two issues common to particle-in-cell based\nalgorithms for contact are also addressed: material bodies tend to stick at a\ngap which is proportional to the grid spacing; and material points tend to\nstick together permanently when located within the same grid cell, making\nmaterial rebound and friction challenging. We show that the use of APIC,\ncombined with a grid transfer and momentum update algorithm results in contact\nbeing enforced at essentially zero gap. For the second issue, we propose a\nnovel iterative scheme which allows particles interacting through the\nbackground grid to naturally separate after contact and enforce friction, while\nstill satisfying momentum conservation.",

    "abstract": "This paper shows analytical and experimental evidence of using the vibration\ndynamics of a compliant whisker for accurate terrain classification during\nsteady state motion of a mobile robot. A Hall effect sensor was used to measure\nwhisker vibrations due to perturbations from the ground. Analytical results\npredict that the whisker vibrations will have a dominant frequency at the\nvertical perturbation frequency of the mobile robot sandwiched by two other\nless dominant but distinct frequency components. These frequency components may\ncome from bifurcation of vibration frequency due to nonlinear interaction\ndynamics at steady state. Experimental results also exhibit distinct dominant\nfrequency components unique to the speed of the robot and the terrain\nroughness. This nonlinear dynamic feature is used in a deep multi-layer\nperceptron neural network to classify terrains. We achieved 85.6\\% prediction\nsuccess rate for seven flat terrain surfaces with different textures.",

    "title": "Implementation of a Multi-Beam MAC Protocol for Multi-Hop Wireless  Networks in Riverbed Modeler",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in antenna technology have made the design of multi-beam\nantennas (MBA) feasible. Compared to an omni-directional or a single beam\ndirectional antenna, an MBA equipped node can achieve a throughput of up to m\ntimes, by simultaneously communicating on its m non-interfering beams. As a\nresult, a few multi-beam directional medium access control (MAC) schemes have\nbeen proposed in the literature recently, which are implemented mostly on the\nin-house simulation setups in Matlab or C/C++. These implementations make many\nassumptions to simplify their design, without a thorough implementation of\nother network layers. However, the implementation of a multi-beam MAC scheme on\nthe well-known discrete event network simulator platforms (such as the Riverbed\nModeler, NS3, QualNet) is challenging as it requires extensive changes and\nadditions to various source code modules. In fact, the network protocols in\nthese simulator packages have been mainly designed for omni-directional\ncommunication, and very few implementations of directional MAC and other\nnetwork protocols exist in the literature.\nThis paper presents a framework to implement a multi-beam directional MAC\nscheme in multi-hop wireless networks, by using the Wireless Suite of Riverbed\nModeler. The detailed implementation procedures are described for multi-beam\nantenna module, multi-beam node model, concurrent packet transmission and\nreception, scheduling, collision avoidance, retransmission, and local node\nsynchronization. These MAC modules and methodology can be very helpful to the\nresearchers and developers for implementing the single-beam as well as\nmulti-beam directional MAC and routing protocols in Riverbed Modeler.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of learning observation models end-to-end for\nestimation. Robots operating in partially observable environments must infer\nlatent states from multiple sensory inputs using observation models that\ncapture the joint distribution between latent states and observations. This\ninference problem can be formulated as an objective over a graph that optimizes\nfor the most likely sequence of states using all previous measurements. Prior\nwork uses observation models that are either known a-priori or trained on\nsurrogate losses independent of the graph optimizer. In this paper, we propose\na method to directly optimize end-to-end tracking performance by learning\nobservation models with the graph optimizer in the loop. This direct approach\nmay appear, however, to require the inference algorithm to be fully\ndifferentiable, which many state-of-the-art graph optimizers are not. Our key\ninsight is to instead formulate the problem as that of energy-based learning.\nWe propose a novel approach, LEO, for learning observation models end-to-end\nwith non-differentiable graph optimizers. LEO alternates between sampling\ntrajectories from the graph posterior and updating the model to match these\nsamples to ground truth trajectories. We propose a way to generate such samples\nefficiently using incremental Gauss-Newton solvers. We compare LEO against\nbaselines on datasets drawn from two distinct tasks: navigation and real-world\nplanar pushing. We show that LEO is able to learn complex observation models\nwith lower errors and fewer samples. Supplementary video:\nhttps://youtu.be/qWcH9CBXs5c",

    "abstract": "The rapidly emerging field of deep learning-based computational pathology has\ndemonstrated promise in developing objective prognostic models from histology\nwhole slide images. However, most prognostic models are either based on\nhistology or genomics alone and do not address how histology and genomics can\nbe integrated to develop joint image-omic prognostic models. Additionally\nidentifying explainable morphological and molecular descriptors from these\nmodels that govern such prognosis is of interest. We used multimodal deep\nlearning to integrate gigapixel whole slide pathology images, RNA-seq\nabundance, copy number variation, and mutation data from 5,720 patients across\n14 major cancer types. Our interpretable, weakly-supervised, multimodal deep\nlearning algorithm is able to fuse these heterogeneous modalities for\npredicting outcomes and discover prognostic features from these modalities that\ncorroborate with poor and favorable outcomes via multimodal interpretability.\nWe compared our model with unimodal deep learning models trained on histology\nslides and molecular profiles alone, and demonstrate performance increase in\nrisk stratification on 9 out of 14 cancers. In addition, we analyze morphologic\nand molecular markers responsible for prognostic predictions across all cancer\ntypes. All analyzed data, including morphological and molecular correlates of\npatient prognosis across the 14 cancer types at a disease and patient level are\npresented in an interactive open-access database\n(this http URL) to allow for further exploration and\nprognostic biomarker discovery. To validate that these model explanations are\nprognostic, we further analyzed high attention morphological regions in WSIs,\nwhich indicates that tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte presence corroborates with\nfavorable cancer prognosis on 9 out of 14 cancer types studied.",

    "abstract": "At present, high-dimensional global optimization problems with time-series\nmodels have received much attention from engineering fields. Since it was\nproposed, Bayesian optimization has quickly become a popular and promising\napproach for solving global optimization problems. However, the standard\nBayesian optimization algorithm is insufficient to solving the global optimal\nsolution when the model is high-dimensional. Hence, this paper presents a novel\nhigh dimensional Bayesian optimization algorithm by considering dimension\nreduction and different dimension fill-in strategies. Most existing literature\nabout Bayesian optimization algorithms did not discuss the sampling strategies\nto optimize the acquisition function. This study proposed a new sampling method\nbased on both the multi-armed bandit and random search methods while optimizing\nthe acquisition function. Besides, based on the time-dependent or\ndimension-dependent characteristics of the model, the proposed algorithm can\nreduce the dimension evenly. Then, five different dimension fill-in strategies\nwere discussed and compared in this study. Finally, to increase the final\naccuracy of the optimal solution, the proposed algorithm adds a local search\nbased on a series of Adam-based steps at the final stage. Our computational\nexperiments demonstrated that the proposed Bayesian optimization algorithm\ncould achieve reasonable solutions with excellent performances for high\ndimensional global optimization problems with a time-series optimal control\nmodel.",

    "abstract": "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent networks are frequently used for\ntasks involving time sequential data such as speech recognition. However, it is\ndifficult to deploy these networks on hardware to achieve high throughput and\nlow latency because the fully-connected structure makes LSTM networks a\nmemory-bounded algorithm. Previous work in LSTM accelerators either exploited\nweight spatial sparsity or temporal sparsity. In this paper, we present a new\naccelerator called \"Spartus\" that exploits spatio-temporal sparsity to achieve\nultra-low latency inference. The spatial sparsity was induced using our\nproposed pruning method called Column-Balanced Targeted Dropout (CBTD) that\nleads to structured sparse weight matrices benefiting workload balance. It\nachieved up to 96% weight sparsity with negligible accuracy difference for an\nLSTM network trained on a TIMIT phone recognition task. To induce temporal\nsparsity in LSTM, we create the DeltaLSTM by extending the previous DeltaGRU\nmethod to the LSTM network. This combined sparsity saves on weight memory\naccess and associated arithmetic operations simultaneously. Spartus was\nimplemented on a Xilinx Zynq-7100 FPGA. The per-sample latency for a single\nDeltaLSTM layer of 1024 neurons running on Spartus is 1 us. Spartus achieved\n9.4 TOp/s effective batch-1 throughput and 1.1 TOp/J energy efficiency, which\nare respectively 4X and 7X higher than the previous state-of-the-art.",

This paper considers two major problems: how to learn\na diversified policy (instead of just one average policy) that can efficiently\nhandle different workpieces with minimum amount of training data, and how to\nhandle defects of workpieces during insertion. To address the problems, we\npropose tolerance-guided policy learning. To encourage transferability of the\nlearned policy to different workpieces, we add a task embedding to the policy's\ninput space using the insertion tolerance. Then we train the policy using\ngenerative adversarial imitation learning with reward shaping (RS-GAIL) on a\nvariety of representative situations. To encourage adaptability of the learned\npolicy to handle defects, we build a probabilistic inference model that can\noutput the best inserting pose based on failed insertions using the tolerance\nmodel. The best inserting pose is then used as a reference to the learned\npolicy. This proposed method is validated on a sequence of IC socket insertion\ntasks in simulation. The results show that 1) RS-GAIL can efficiently learn\noptimal policies under sparse rewards; 2) the tolerance embedding can enhance\nthe transferability of the learned policy; 3) the probabilistic inference makes\nthe policy robust to defects on the workpieces.",

Evaluation of BEANNA was\nperformed by comparing a hybrid network with floating point outer layers and\nbinary hidden layers to a network with only floating point layers. The hybrid\nnetwork accelerated using BEANNA achieved a 194% throughput increase, a 68%\nmemory usage decrease, and a 66% energy consumption decrease per inference, all\nthis at the cost of a mere 0.23% classification accuracy decrease on the MNIST\ndataset.",

    "title": "Deep Stable neural networks: large-width asymptotics and convergence  rates",
    "abstract": "In modern deep learning, there is a recent and growing literature on the\ninterplay between large-width asymptotics for deep Gaussian neural networks\n(NNs), i.e. deep NNs with Gaussian-distributed weights, and classes of Gaussian\nstochastic processes (SPs). Such an interplay has proved to be critical in\nseveral contexts of practical interest, e.g. Bayesian inference under Gaussian\nSP priors, kernel regression for infinite-wide deep NNs trained via gradient\ndescent, and information propagation within infinite-wide NNs. Motivated by\nempirical analysis, showing the potential of replacing Gaussian distributions\nwith Stable distributions for the NN's weights, in this paper we investigate\nlarge-width asymptotics for (fully connected) feed-forward deep Stable NNs,\ni.e. deep NNs with Stable-distributed weights. First, we show that as the width\ngoes to infinity jointly over the NN's layers, a suitable rescaled deep Stable\nNN converges weakly to a Stable SP whose distribution is characterized\nrecursively through the NN's layers. Because of the non-triangular NN's\nstructure, this is a non-standard asymptotic problem, to which we propose a\nnovel and self-contained inductive approach, which may be of independent\ninterest. Then, we establish sup-norm convergence rates of a deep Stable NN to\na Stable SP, quantifying the critical difference between the settings of\n``joint growth\" and ``sequential growth\" of the width over the NN's layers. Our\nwork extends recent results on infinite-wide limits for deep Gaussian NNs to\nthe more general deep Stable NNs, providing the first result on convergence\nrates for infinite-wide deep NNs.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has an increasing impact to assist research, allowing, for\nexample, the discovery of novel materials. Until now, however, these artificial\nintelligence techniques have fallen short of discovering the full differential\nequation of an experimental physical system. Here we show that a dynamical\nneural network, trained on a minimal amount of data, can predict the behavior\nof spintronic devices with high accuracy and an extremely efficient simulation\ntime, compared to the micromagnetic simulations that are usually employed to\nmodel them. For this purpose, we re-frame the formalism of Neural Ordinary\nDifferential Equations (ODEs) to the constraints of spintronics: few measured\noutputs, multiple inputs and internal parameters. We demonstrate with\nSpin-Neural ODEs an acceleration factor over 200 compared to micromagnetic\nsimulations for a complex problem -- the simulation of a reservoir computer\nmade of magnetic skyrmions (20 minutes compared to three days). In a second\nrealization, we show that we can predict the noisy response of experimental\nspintronic nano-oscillators to varying inputs after training Spin-Neural ODEs\non five milliseconds of their measured response to different excitations.\nSpin-Neural ODE is a disruptive tool for developing spintronic applications in\ncomplement to micromagnetic simulations, which are time-consuming and cannot\nfit experiments when noise or imperfections are present. Spin-Neural ODE can\nalso be generalized to other electronic devices involving dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks can be powerful function approximators, which are able to\nmodel high-dimensional feature distributions from a subset of examples drawn\nfrom the target distribution. Naturally, they perform well at generalizing\nwithin the limits of their target function, but they often fail to generalize\noutside of the explicitly learned feature space. It is therefore an open\nresearch topic whether and how neural network-based architectures can be\ndeployed for systematic reasoning. Many studies have shown evidence for poor\ngeneralization, but they often work with abstract data or are limited to\nsingle-channel input. Humans, however, learn and interact through a combination\nof multiple sensory modalities, and rarely rely on just one. To investigate\ncompositional generalization in a multimodal setting, we generate an extensible\ndataset with multimodal input sequences from simulation. We investigate the\ninfluence of the underlying training data distribution on compostional\ngeneralization in a minimal LSTM-based network trained in a supervised, time\ncontinuous setting. We find compositional generalization to fail in simple\nsetups while improving with the number of objects, actions, and particularly\nwith a lot of color overlaps between objects.

This paper proposes a\nframework of Active Reinforcement Learning (ARL) over MDPs to improve\ngeneralization efficiency in a limited resource by instance selection. Given a\nnumber of instances, the algorithm chooses out valuable instances as training\nsets while training the policy, thereby costing fewer resources.

    "abstract": "The spread of COVID-19 has been a major disruptive force in people's everyday\nlives and mobility behavior. The demand for on-demand ride services, such as\ntaxis and ridehailing has been specifically impacted, given both restrictions\nin service operations and user's concerns about virus transmission in shared\nvehicles. During the pandemic, demand for these modes have decreased by as much\nas 80%. This study examines intentions to use on-demand ride services in a\nperiod of drastic changes in lifestyles and daily routines coupled with\nunprecedented mobility reductions. Specifically, we examine the determinants\nfor the shift of intentions to use these on-demand modes of travel in the early\nstages of the pandemic. Using data from a survey disseminated in June 2020 to\n700 respondents from contiguous United States, ordinal regression modeling is\napplied to analyze the shift in consideration. The results indicate that\npolitical orientation and health-related experiences during the pandemic are\nsignificant sources of variation for individual changes in intentions to use\nridehailing. Additionally, characteristics such as age and income result in\nconsideration shifts that contradict the typical ridership profiles found in\nthe ridehailing literature. Specifically, on-demand ride consideration\ndecreases as a function of age and income. Moreover, transit-users are more\nwilling to consider on-demand rides than private vehicle users, suggesting that\nshared vehicle modes have a similar risk-profile. We discuss the role of\non-demand ride services in the pandemic era, and the need to investigate\npolitical orientation and evolving pandemic experiences to pinpoint their role\nin future mobility systems.",

    "abstract": "As news organizations embrace transparency practices on their websites to\ndistinguish themselves from those spreading misinformation, HCI designers have\nthe opportunity to help them effectively utilize the ideals of transparency to\nbuild trust. How can we utilize transparency to promote trust in news? We\nexamine this question through a qualitative lens by interviewing journalists\nand news consumers---the two stakeholders in a news system. We designed a\nscenario to demonstrate transparency features using two fundamental news\nattributes that convey the trustworthiness of a news article: source and\nmessage. In the interviews, our news consumers expressed the idea that news\ntransparency could be best shown by providing indicators of objectivity in two\nareas (news selection and framing) and by providing indicators of evidence in\nfour areas (presence of source materials, anonymous sourcing, verification, and\ncorrections upon erroneous reporting). While our journalists agreed with news\nconsumers' suggestions of using evidence indicators, they also suggested\nadditional transparency indicators in areas such as the news reporting process\nand personal/organizational conflicts of interest. Prompted by our scenario,\nparticipants offered new design considerations for building trustworthy news\nplatforms, such as designing for easy comprehension, presenting appropriate\ndetails in news articles (e.g., showing the number and nature of corrections\nmade to an article), and comparing attributes across news organizations to\nhighlight diverging practices. Comparing the responses from our two stakeholder\ngroups reveals conflicting suggestions with trade-offs between them.

However, due to the mobility of users and a wide range of IoT\napplications with different requirements, it is a challenging issue to satisfy\nthese applications' requirements. The execution of IoT applications exclusively\non one fog/edge server may not be always feasible due to limited resources,\nwhile execution of IoT applications on different servers needs further\ncollaboration among servers.

Task performance (correctness) varied with profession across more complex\nvisualizations, but not pie charts, a comparatively common visualization.

There are three\nmajor challenges facing OTPs: sparsity, diversity, and implicitness. In this\npaper, we present a novel Fliggy ITinerary-aware deep matching NETwork (FitNET)\nto address these three challenges. FitNET is designed based on the popular deep\nmatching network, which has been successfully employed in many industrial\nrecommendation systems, due to its effectiveness. The concept itinerary is\nfirstly proposed under the context of recommendation systems for OTPs, which is\ndefined as the list of unconsumed orders of a user. All orders in a user\nitinerary are learned as a whole, based on which the implicit travel intention\nof each user can be more accurately inferred. To alleviate the sparsity\nproblem, users' profiles are incorporated into FitNET. Meanwhile, a series of\nitinerary-aware attention mechanisms that capture the vital interactions\nbetween user's itinerary and other input categories are carefully designed.\nThese mechanisms are very helpful in inferring a user's travel intention or\npreference, and handling the diversity in a user's need. Further, two training\nobjectives, i.e., prediction accuracy of user's travel intention and prediction\naccuracy of user's click behavior, are utilized by FitNET, so that these two\nobjectives can be optimized simultaneously. An offline experiment on Fliggy\nproduction dataset with over 0.27 million users and 1.55 million travel items,\nand an online A/B test both show that FitNET effectively learns users' travel\nintentions, preferences, and diverse needs, based on their itineraries and\ngains superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Instance segmentation on point clouds is a fundamental task in 3D scene\nperception. In this work, we propose a concise clustering-based framework named\nHAIS, which makes full use of spatial relation of points and point sets.\nConsidering clustering-based methods may result in over-segmentation or\nunder-segmentation, we introduce the hierarchical aggregation to progressively\ngenerate instance proposals, i.e., point aggregation for preliminarily\nclustering points to sets and set aggregation for generating complete instances\nfrom sets. Once the complete 3D instances are obtained, a sub-network of\nintra-instance prediction is adopted for noisy points filtering and mask\nquality scoring. HAIS is fast (only 410ms per frame) and does not require\nnon-maximum suppression. It ranks 1st on the ScanNet v2 benchmark, achieving\nthe highest 69.9% AP50 and surpassing previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods\nby a large margin. Besides, the SOTA results on the S3DIS dataset validate the\ngood generalization ability. Code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/hustvl/HAIS.",

    "abstract": "Aspect-level sentiment classification (ASC) aims to predict the fine-grained\nsentiment polarity towards a given aspect mentioned in a review. Despite recent\nadvances in ASC, enabling machines to preciously infer aspect sentiments is\nstill challenging. This paper tackles two challenges in ASC: (1) due to lack of\naspect knowledge, aspect representation derived in prior works is inadequate to\nrepresent aspect's exact meaning and property information; (2) prior works only\ncapture either local syntactic information or global relational information,\nthus missing either one of them leads to insufficient syntactic information. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose a novel ASC model which not only end-to-end\nembeds and leverages aspect knowledge but also marries the two kinds of\nsyntactic information and lets them compensate for each other. Our model\nincludes three key components: (1) a knowledge-aware gated recurrent memory\nnetwork recurrently integrates dynamically summarized aspect knowledge; (2) a\ndual syntax graph network combines both kinds of syntactic information to\ncomprehensively capture sufficient syntactic information; (3) a knowledge\nintegrating gate re-enhances the final representation with further needed\naspect knowledge; (4) an aspect-to-context attention mechanism aggregates the\naspect-related semantics from all hidden states into the final representation.\nExperimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our model, which overpass previous state-of-the-art models by\nlarge margins in terms of both Accuracy and Macro-F1.",

    "abstract": "The vanilla GAN [5] suffers from mode collapse deeply, which usually\nmanifests as that the images generated by generators tend to have a high\nsimilarity amongst them, even though their corresponding latent vectors have\nbeen very different. In this paper, we introduce a pluggable block called\ndiversity penalty (dp) to alleviate mode collapse of GANs. It is used to reduce\nthe similarity of image pairs in feature space, i.e., if two latent vectors are\ndifferent, then we enforce the generator to generate two images with different\nfeatures. The normalized Gram Matrix is used to measure the similarity. We\ncompare the proposed method with Unrolled GAN [17], BourGAN [26], PacGAN [14],\nVEEGAN [23] and ALI [4] on 2D synthetic dataset, and results show that our\nproposed method can help GAN capture more modes of the data distribution.\nFurther, we apply this penalty term into image data augmentation on MNIST,\nFashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10, and the testing accuracy is improved by 0.24%,\n1.34% and 0.52% compared with WGAN GP [6], respectively.

    "title": "Video Abnormal Event Detection by Learning to Complete Visual Cloze  Tests",
    "abstract": "Video abnormal event detection (VAD) is a vital semi-supervised task that\nrequires learning with only roughly labeled normal videos, as anomalies are\noften practically unavailable. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) enable\ngreat progress in VAD, existing solutions typically suffer from two issues: (1)\nThe precise and comprehensive localization of video events is ignored. (2) The\nvideo semantics and temporal context are under-explored. To address those\nissues, we are motivated by the prevalent cloze test in education and propose a\nnovel approach named visual cloze completion (VCC), which performs VAD by\nlearning to complete \"visual cloze tests\" (VCTs). Specifically, VCC first\nlocalizes each video event and encloses it into a spatio-temporal cube (STC).\nTo achieve both precise and comprehensive localization, appearance and motion\nare used as mutually complementary cues to mark the object region associated\nwith each video event. For each marked region, a normalized patch sequence is\nextracted from temporally adjacent frames and stacked into the STC. By\ncomparing each patch and the patch sequence of a STC to a visual \"word\" and\n\"sentence\" respectively, we can deliberately erase a certain \"word\" (patch) to\nyield a VCT. DNNs are then trained to infer the erased patch by video\nsemantics, so as to complete the VCT. To fully exploit the temporal context,\neach patch in STC is alternatively erased to create multiple VCTs, and the\nerased patch's optical flow is also inferred to integrate richer motion clues.\nMeanwhile, a new DNN architecture is designed as a model-level solution to\nutilize video semantics and temporal context. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat VCC achieves state-of-the-art VAD performance. Our codes and results are\nopen at \\url{https://github.com/yuguangnudt/VEC_VAD/tree/VCC}",

    "abstract": "Video captioning combines video understanding and language generation.\nDifferent from image captioning that describes a static image with details of\nalmost every object, video captioning usually considers a sequence of frames\nand biases towards focused objects, e.g., the objects that stay in focus\nregardless of the changing background. Therefore, detecting and properly\naccommodating focused objects is critical in video captioning. To enforce the\ndescription of focused objects and achieve controllable video captioning, we\npropose an Object-Oriented Non-Autoregressive approach (O2NA), which performs\ncaption generation in three steps: 1) identify the focused objects and predict\ntheir locations in the target caption; 2) generate the related attribute words\nand relation words of these focused objects to form a draft caption; and 3)\ncombine video information to refine the draft caption to a fluent final\ncaption. Since the focused objects are generated and located ahead of other\nwords, it is difficult to apply the word-by-word autoregressive generation\nprocess; instead, we adopt a non-autoregressive approach. The experiments on\ntwo benchmark datasets, i.e., MSR-VTT and MSVD, demonstrate the effectiveness\nof O2NA, which achieves results competitive with the state-of-the-arts but with\nboth higher diversity and higher inference speed.",

    "abstract": "The intellectual property (IP) of Deep neural networks (DNNs) can be easily\n``stolen'' by surrogate model attack. There has been significant progress in\nsolutions to protect the IP of DNN models in classification tasks. However,\nlittle attention has been devoted to the protection of DNNs in image processing\ntasks. By utilizing consistent invisible spatial watermarks, one recent work\nfirst considered model watermarking for deep image processing networks and\ndemonstrated its efficacy in many downstream tasks. Nevertheless, it highly\ndepends on the hypothesis that the embedded watermarks in the network outputs\nare consistent. When the attacker uses some common data augmentation attacks\n(e.g., rotate, crop, and resize) during surrogate model training, it will\ntotally fail because the underlying watermark consistency is destroyed. To\nmitigate this issue, we propose a new watermarking methodology, namely\n``structure consistency'', based on which a new deep structure-aligned model\nwatermarking algorithm is designed. Specifically, the embedded watermarks are\ndesigned to be aligned with physically consistent image structures, such as\nedges or semantic regions. Experiments demonstrate that our method is much more\nrobust than the baseline method in resisting data augmentation attacks for\nmodel IP protection. Besides that, we further test the generalization ability\nand robustness of our method to a broader range of circumvention attacks.",

    "abstract": "The task of video-based commonsense captioning aims to generate event-wise\ncaptions and meanwhile provide multiple commonsense descriptions (e.g.,\nattribute, effect and intention) about the underlying event in the video. Prior\nworks explore the commonsense captions by using separate networks for different\ncommonsense types, which is time-consuming and lacks mining the interaction of\ndifferent commonsense. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Reasoning Network\n(HybridNet) to endow the neural networks with the capability of semantic-level\nreasoning and word-level reasoning. Firstly, we develop multi-commonsense\nlearning for semantic-level reasoning by jointly training different commonsense\ntypes in a unified network, which encourages the interaction between the clues\nof multiple commonsense descriptions, event-wise captions and videos. Then,\nthere are two steps to achieve the word-level reasoning: (1) a memory module\nrecords the history predicted sequence from the previous generation processes;\n(2) a memory-routed multi-head attention (MMHA) module updates the word-level\nattention maps by incorporating the history information from the memory module\ninto the transformer decoder for word-level reasoning. Moreover, the multimodal\nfeatures are used to make full use of diverse knowledge for commonsense\nreasoning.

Since then, the problem has seen a long list of follow-up results\npertaining to variations as well as to upper and lower bound improvements. All\nestablished results in the area study this 2-dimensional search-type problem in\nthe Euclidean metric space where the search space, i.e. the unit disk, enjoys\nsignificant (metric) symmetries.\nWe initiate and study the problem of evacuating 2 robots in the wireless\nmodel from $\\ell_p$ unit disks, $p \\in [1,\\infty)$, where in particular robots'\nmoves are measured in the underlying metric space. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study of a search-type problem with mobile agents\nin more general metric spaces. The problem is particularly challenging since\neven the circumference of the $\\ell_p$ unit disks have been the subject of\ntechnical studies. In our main result, and after identifying and utilizing the\nvery few symmetries of $\\ell_p$ unit disks, we design \\emph{optimal evacuation\nalgorithms} that vary with $p$. Our main technical contributions are two-fold.\nFirst, in our upper bound results, we provide (nearly) closed formulae for the\nworst case cost of our algorithms. Second, and most importantly, our lower\nbounds' arguments reduce to a novel observation in convex geometry which\nanalyzes trade-offs between arc and chord lengths of $\\ell_p$ unit disks as the\nendpoints of the arcs (chords) change position around the perimeter of the\ndisk, which we believe is interesting in its own right. Part of our argument\npertaining to the latter property relies on a computer assisted numerical\nverification that can be done for non-extreme values of $p$.",

Many recent OSR methods rely on auto-encoders to extract class-specific\nfeatures by a reconstruction strategy, requiring the network to restore the\ninput image on pixel-level. This strategy is commonly over-demanding for OSR\nsince class-specific features are generally contained in target objects, not in\nall pixels. To address this shortcoming, here we discard the pixel-level\nreconstruction strategy and pay more attention to improving the effectiveness\nof class-specific feature extraction. We propose a mutual information-based\nmethod with a streamlined architecture, Maximal Mutual Information Open Set\nRecognition (M2IOSR). The proposed M2IOSR only uses an encoder to extract\nclass-specific features by maximizing the mutual information between the given\ninput and its latent features across multiple scales. Meanwhile, to further\nreduce the open space risk, latent features are constrained to class\nconditional Gaussian distributions by a KL-divergence loss function. In this\nway, a strong function is learned to prevent the network from mapping different\nobservations to similar latent features and help the network extract\nclass-specific features with desired statistical characteristics. The proposed\nmethod significantly improves the performance of baselines and achieves new\nstate-of-the-art results on several benchmarks consistently.

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation is a crucial image understanding task, where each pixel\nof image is categorized into a corresponding label. Since the pixel-wise\nlabeling for ground-truth is tedious and labor intensive, in practical\napplications, many works exploit the synthetic images to train the model for\nreal-word image semantic segmentation, i.e., Synthetic-to-Real Semantic\nSegmentation (SRSS). However, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained\non the source synthetic data may not generalize well to the target real-world\ndata. In this work, we propose two simple yet effective texture randomization\nmechanisms, Global Texture Randomization (GTR) and Local Texture Randomization\n(LTR), for Domain Generalization based SRSS. GTR is proposed to randomize the\ntexture of source images into diverse unreal texture styles. It aims to\nalleviate the reliance of the network on texture while promoting the learning\nof the domain-invariant cues. In addition, we find the texture difference is\nnot always occurred in entire image and may only appear in some local areas.\nTherefore, we further propose a LTR mechanism to generate diverse local regions\nfor partially stylizing the source images. Finally, we implement a\nregularization of Consistency between GTR and LTR (CGL) aiming to harmonize the\ntwo proposed mechanisms during training. Extensive experiments on five publicly\navailable datasets (i.e., GTA5, SYNTHIA, Cityscapes, BDDS and Mapillary) with\nvarious SRSS settings (i.e., GTA5/SYNTHIA to Cityscapes/BDDS/Mapillary)\ndemonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art\nmethods for domain generalization based SRSS.",

    "title": "TransRefer3D: Entity-and-Relation Aware Transformer for Fine-Grained 3D  Visual Grounding",
    "abstract": "Recently proposed fine-grained 3D visual grounding is an essential and\nchallenging task, whose goal is to identify the 3D object referred by a natural\nlanguage sentence from other distractive objects of the same category. Existing\nworks usually adopt dynamic graph networks to indirectly model the\nintra/inter-modal interactions, making the model difficult to distinguish the\nreferred object from distractors due to the monolithic representations of\nvisual and linguistic contents. In this work, we exploit Transformer for its\nnatural suitability on permutation-invariant 3D point clouds data and propose a\nTransRefer3D network to extract entity-and-relation aware multimodal context\namong objects for more discriminative feature learning. Concretely, we devise\nan Entity-aware Attention (EA) module and a Relation-aware Attention (RA)\nmodule to conduct fine-grained cross-modal feature matching. Facilitated by\nco-attention operation, our EA module matches visual entity features with\nlinguistic entity features while RA module matches pair-wise visual relation\nfeatures with linguistic relation features, respectively. We further integrate\nEA and RA modules into an Entity-and-Relation aware Contextual Block (ERCB) and\nstack several ERCBs to form our TransRefer3D for hierarchical multimodal\ncontext modeling. Extensive experiments on both Nr3D and Sr3D datasets\ndemonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing\napproaches by up to 10.6% and claims the new state-of-the-art. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first work investigating Transformer architecture\nfor fine-grained 3D visual grounding task.",

    "abstract": "Answering complex First-Order Logical (FOL) queries on large-scale incomplete\nknowledge graphs (KGs) is an important yet challenging task. Recent advances\nembed logical queries and KG entities in the vector space and conduct query\nanswering via dense similarity search. However, most of the designed logical\noperators in existing works do not satisfy the axiomatic system of classical\nlogic. Moreover, these logical operators are parameterized so that they require\na large number of complex FOL queries as training data, which are often arduous\nor even inaccessible to collect in most real-world KGs. In this paper, we\npresent FuzzQE, a fuzzy logic based query embedding framework for answering FOL\nqueries over KGs. FuzzQE follows fuzzy logic to define logical operators in a\nprincipled and learning free manner. Extensive experiments on two benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that FuzzQE achieves significantly better performance in\nanswering FOL queries compared to the state-of-the-art methods. In addition,\nFuzzQE trained with only KG link prediction without any complex queries can\nachieve comparable performance with the systems trained with all FOL queries.",

However, existing decentralized\nlearning frameworks usually assume perfect communication among devices, where\nthey can reliably exchange messages, e.g., gradients or parameters.

Despite its significant\npractical and research value, the webly supervised fine-grained recognition\nproblem is not extensively studied in the computer vision community, largely\ndue to the lack of high-quality datasets. To fill this gap, in this paper we\nconstruct two new benchmark webly supervised fine-grained datasets, termed\nWebFG-496 and WebiNat-5089, respectively. In concretely, WebFG-496 consists of\nthree sub-datasets containing a total of 53,339 web training images with 200\nspecies of birds (Web-bird), 100 types of aircrafts (Web-aircraft), and 196\nmodels of cars (Web-car).

While functional safety is a well-established concept, the question\nof measuring the behavioral safety of a vehicle remains subject to research.\nOne way to both objectively and computationally analyze traffic conflicts is\nthe development and utilization of so-called criticality metrics. Contemporary\napproaches have leveraged the potential of criticality metrics in various\napplications related to automated driving, e.g. for computationally assessing\nthe dynamic risk or filtering large data sets to build scenario catalogs.

To accelerate its convergence, we propose a simple\nyet effective scheme for improving the DETR framework, namely Spatially\nModulated Co-Attention (SMCA) mechanism. The core idea of SMCA is to conduct\nlocation-aware co-attention in DETR by constraining co-attention responses to\nbe high near initially estimated bounding box locations.

From a novel perspective, we\nargue that the bridging between the source and target domains can be utilized\nto tackle the UDA re-ID task, and we focus on explicitly modeling appropriate\nintermediate domains to characterize this bridging. Specifically, we propose an\nIntermediate Domain Module (IDM) to generate intermediate domains'\nrepresentations on-the-fly by mixing the source and target domains' hidden\nrepresentations using two domain factors. Based on the \"shortest geodesic path\"\ndefinition, i.e., the intermediate domains along the shortest geodesic path\nbetween the two extreme domains can play a better bridging role, we propose two\nproperties that these intermediate domains should satisfy. To ensure these two\nproperties to better characterize appropriate intermediate domains, we enforce\nthe bridge losses on intermediate domains' prediction space and feature space,\nand enforce a diversity loss on the two domain factors. The bridge losses aim\nat guiding the distribution of appropriate intermediate domains to keep the\nright distance to the source and target domains. The diversity loss serves as a\nregularization to prevent the generated intermediate domains from being\nover-fitting to either of the source and target domains.

    "abstract": "The current state-of-the-art image-sentence retrieval methods implicitly\nalign the visual-textual fragments, like regions in images and words in\nsentences, and adopt attention modules to highlight the relevance of\ncross-modal semantic correspondences. However, the retrieval performance\nremains unsatisfactory due to a lack of consistent representation in both\nsemantics and structural spaces. In this work, we propose to address the above\nissue from two aspects: (i) constructing intrinsic structure (along with\nrelations) among the fragments of respective modalities, e.g., \"dog $\\to$ play\n$\\to$ ball\" in semantic structure for an image, and (ii) seeking explicit\ninter-modal structural and semantic correspondence between the visual and\ntextual modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel Structured Multi-modal\nFeature Embedding and Alignment (SMFEA) model for image-sentence retrieval. In\norder to jointly and explicitly learn the visual-textual embedding and the\ncross-modal alignment, SMFEA creates a novel multi-modal structured module with\na shared context-aware referral tree. In particular, the relations of the\nvisual and textual fragments are modeled by constructing Visual Context-aware\nStructured Tree encoder (VCS-Tree) and Textual Context-aware Structured Tree\nencoder (TCS-Tree) with shared labels, from which visual and textual features\ncan be jointly learned and optimized. We utilize the multi-modal tree structure\nto explicitly align the heterogeneous image-sentence data by maximizing the\nsemantic and structural similarity between corresponding inter-modal tree\nnodes.

The\nmotivation for constructing this ABM, which is known as the Bristol Betting\nExchange (BBE), is so that it can serve as a synthetic data generator,\nproducing large volumes of data that can be used to develop and test new\nbetting strategies via advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques.\nBetting exchanges act as online platforms on which bettors can find willing\ncounterparties to a bet, and they do this in a way that is directly comparable\nto the manner in which electronic financial exchanges, such as major stock\nmarkets, act as platforms that allow traders to find willing counterparties to\nbuy from or sell to: the platform aggregates and anonymises orders from\nmultiple participants, showing a summary of the market that is updated in\nreal-time. In the first instance, BBE is aimed primarily at producing synthetic\ndata for in-play betting (also known as in-race or in-game betting) where\nbettors can place bets on the outcome of a track-race event, such as a horse\nrace, after the race has started and for as long as the race is underway, with\nbetting only ceasing when the race ends. The rationale for, and design of, BBE\nhas been described in detail in a previous paper that we summarise here, before\ndiscussing our comparative results which contrast a single-threaded\nimplementation in Python, a multi-threaded implementation in Python, and an\nimplementation where Python header-code calls simulations of the track-racing\nevents written in OpenCL that execute on a 640-core GPU -- this runs\napproximately 1000 times faster than the single-threaded Python. Our\nsource-code for BBE is freely available on GitHub.",

    "title": "Reachability-based Safe Planning for Multi-Vehicle Systems withMultiple  Targets",
    "abstract": "Recently there have been a lot of interests in introducing UAVs for a wide\nrange of applications, making ensuring safety of multi-vehicle systems a highly\ncrucial problem. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a promising tool for\nanalyzing safety of vehicles for low-dimensional systems. However, reachability\nsuffers from the curse of dimensionality, making its direct application to more\nthan two vehicles intractable. Recent works have made it tractable to guarantee\nsafety for 3 and 4 vehicles with reachability. However, the number of vehicles\nsafety can be guaranteed for remains small. In this paper, we propose a novel\nreachability-based approach that guarantees safety for any number of vehicles\nwhile vehicles complete their objectives of visiting multiple targets\nefficiently, given any K-vehicle collision avoidance algorithm where K can in\ngeneral be a small number. We achieve this by developing an approach to group\nvehicles into clusters efficiently and a control strategy that guarantees\nsafety for any in-cluster and cross-cluster pair of vehicles for all time. Our\nproposed method is scalable to large number of vehicles with little computation\noverhead. We demonstrate our proposed approach with a simulation on 15\nvehicles. In addition, we contribute a more general solution to the 3-vehicle\ncollision avoidance problem from a past recent work, show that the prior work\nis a special case of our proposed generalization, and prove its validity.",

    "abstract": "Automated inspection and detection of foreign objects on railways is\nimportant for rail transportation safety as it helps prevent potential\naccidents and trains derailment. Most existing vision-based approaches focus on\nthe detection of frontal intrusion objects with prior labels, such as\ncategories and locations of the objects. In reality, foreign objects with\nunknown categories can appear anytime on railway tracks. In this paper, we\ndevelop a semi-supervised convolutional autoencoder based framework that only\nrequires railway track images without prior knowledge on the foreign objects in\nthe training process. It consists of three different modules, a bottleneck\nfeature generator as encoder, a photographic image generator as decoder, and a\nreconstruction discriminator developed via adversarial learning. In the\nproposed framework, the problem of detecting the presence, location, and shape\nof foreign objects is addressed by comparing the input and reconstructed images\nas well as setting thresholds based on reconstruction errors. The proposed\nmethod is evaluated through comprehensive studies under different performance\ncriteria. The results show that the proposed method outperforms some well-known\nbenchmarking methods. The proposed framework is useful for data analytics via\nthe train Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems",

Dominant\ncomputer vision-based detection models typically rely on convolutional neural\nnetworks that utilize local image features and cumbersome prior settings to\ngenerate candidate boxes. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional\ntransformer network based method to detect multi-class rail components\nincluding the rail, clip, and bolt.

Our proposed method simplifies the detection pipeline by\neliminating the need of prior settings, such as anchor box, aspect ratio,\ndefault coordinates, and post-processing, such as the threshold for non-maximum\nsuppression; as well as allows users to trade off the quality and complexity of\nthe detector with limited training data.

    "abstract": "Grasping in cluttered scenes has always been a great challenge for robots,\ndue to the requirement of the ability to well understand the scene and object\ninformation. Previous works usually assume that the geometry information of the\nobjects is available, or utilize a step-wise, multi-stage strategy to predict\nthe feasible 6-DoF grasp poses. In this work, we propose to formalize the 6-DoF\ngrasp pose estimation as a simultaneous multi-task learning problem. In a\nunified framework, we jointly predict the feasible 6-DoF grasp poses, instance\nsemantic segmentation, and collision information. The whole framework is\njointly optimized and end-to-end differentiable. Our model is evaluated on\nlarge-scale benchmarks as well as the real robot system. On the public dataset,\nour method outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+4.08\nAP).

Consequently, renewable energy sources are\nincreasingly requested to provide frequency support. In addition, due to the\ninertia loss, the requirements regarding frequency containment reserves (FCR)\nare becoming tough to meet with traditional units such as hydro, whose\nnon-minimum phase (NMP) characteristic reduces the closed-loop stability\nmargins. The shortcomings of traditional synchronous generation motivates new\nprotocols for fast frequency reserves (FFR). In this work, we design a wind\nturbine (WT) model useful for FFR. It is shown that the dynamical shortcomings\nof the WT, in providing steady-power or slow FCR support, are suitably\ndescribed by a first-order transfer function with a slow NMP zero. The WT model\nis tested in a 5-machine representation of the Nordic synchronous grid. It is\nshown that the NMP model is useful for designing a controller that coordinates\nFFR from wind with slow FCR from hydro turbines.

As a\npotential alternative to convolutional neural networks, it shares merits of\nstrong interpretability, high discriminative power on hyper-scale data, and\nflexibility in processing varying length inputs. However, its encoders\nnaturally contain computational intensive operations such as pair-wise\nself-attention, incurring heavy computational burden when being applied on the\ncomplex 3-dimensional video signals.\nThis paper presents Token Shift Module (i.e., TokShift), a novel,\nzero-parameter, zero-FLOPs operator, for modeling temporal relations within\neach transformer encoder.

    "abstract": "Multi-label image recognition is a challenging computer vision task of\npractical use. Progresses in this area, however, are often characterized by\ncomplicated methods, heavy computations, and lack of intuitive explanations. To\neffectively capture different spatial regions occupied by objects from\ndifferent categories, we propose an embarrassingly simple module, named\nclass-specific residual attention (CSRA). CSRA generates class-specific\nfeatures for every category by proposing a simple spatial attention score, and\nthen combines it with the class-agnostic average pooling feature. CSRA achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on multilabel recognition, and at the same time is\nmuch simpler than them. Furthermore, with only 4 lines of code, CSRA also leads\nto consistent improvement across many diverse pretrained models and datasets\nwithout any extra training. CSRA is both easy to implement and light in\ncomputations, which also enjoys intuitive explanations and visualizations.",

Most previous studies at-tempt to develop models for polyp\ndifferentiation using Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) or other enhanced images.\nHowever, the wide range of these models' applications for clinical work has\nbeen limited by the lagging of imaging techniques. Thus, we propose a novel\nframework based on a teacher-student architecture for the accurate colorectal\npolyp classification (CPC) through directly using white-light (WL) colonoscopy\nimages in the examination. In practice, during training, the auxiliary NBI\nimages are utilized to train a teacher network and guide the student network to\nacquire richer feature representation from WL images. The feature transfer is\nrealized by domain alignment and contrastive learning. Eventually the final\nstudent network has the ability to extract aligned features from only WL images\nto facilitate the CPC task. Besides, we release the first public-available\npaired CPC dataset containing WL-NBI pairs for the alignment training.\nQuantitative and qualitative evaluation indicates that the proposed method\noutperforms the previous methods in CPC, improving the accuracy by 5.6%with\nvery fast speed.",

    "abstract": "Recent research shows deep neural networks are vulnerable to different types\nof attacks, such as adversarial attack, data poisoning attack and backdoor\nattack. Among them, backdoor attack is the most cunning one and can occur in\nalmost every stage of deep learning pipeline. Therefore, backdoor attack has\nattracted lots of interests from both academia and industry. However, most\nexisting backdoor attack methods are either visible or fragile to some\neffortless pre-processing such as common data transformations. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a robust and invisible backdoor attack called ``Poison\nInk''. Concretely, we first leverage the image structures as target poisoning\nareas, and fill them with poison ink (information) to generate the trigger\npattern. As the image structure can keep its semantic meaning during the data\ntransformation, such trigger pattern is inherently robust to data\ntransformations. Then we leverage a deep injection network to embed such\ntrigger pattern into the cover image to achieve stealthiness. Compared to\nexisting popular backdoor attack methods, Poison Ink outperforms both in\nstealthiness and robustness. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate\nPoison Ink is not only general to different datasets and network architectures,\nbut also flexible for different attack scenarios. Besides, it also has very\nstrong resistance against many state-of-the-art defense techniques.",

    "abstract": "Automatic speech emotion recognition (SER) is a challenging task that plays a\ncrucial role in natural human-computer interaction. One of the main challenges\nin SER is data scarcity, i.e., insufficient amounts of carefully labeled data\nto build and fully explore complex deep learning models for emotion\nclassification. This paper aims to address this challenge using a transfer\nlearning strategy combined with spectrogram augmentation. Specifically, we\npropose a transfer learning approach that leverages a pre-trained residual\nnetwork (ResNet) model including a statistics pooling layer from speaker\nrecognition trained using large amounts of speaker-labeled data. The statistics\npooling layer enables the model to efficiently process variable-length input,\nthereby eliminating the need for sequence truncation which is commonly used in\nSER systems.

    "abstract": "Children are increasingly using the internet nowadays. While internet use\nexposes children to various privacy and security risks, few studies have\nexamined how parents perceive and address their children's cybersecurity risks.\nTo address this gap, we conducted a qualitative study with 25 parents living in\nNorway with children aged between 10 to 15. We conducted semi-structured\ninterviews with the parents and performed a thematic analysis of the interview\ndata. The results of this paper include a list of cybersecurity awareness needs\nfor children from a parental perspective, a list of learning resources for\nchildren, and a list of challenges for parents to ensure cybersecurity at home.\nOur results are useful for developers and educators in developing cybersecurity\nsolutions for children. Future research should focus on defining cybersecurity\ntheories and practices that contribute to children's and parents' awareness\nabout cybersecurity risks, needs, and solutions.",

    "abstract": "The amount of multimedia content shared everyday, combined with the level of\nrealism reached by recent fake-generating technologies, threatens to impair the\ntrustworthiness of online information sources. The process of uploading and\nsharing data tends to hinder standard media forensic analyses, since multiple\nre-sharing steps progressively hide the traces of past manipulations. At the\nsame time though, new traces are introduced by the platforms themselves,\nenabling the reconstruction of the sharing history of digital objects, with\npossible applications in information flow monitoring and source identification.\nIn this work, we propose a supervised framework for the reconstruction of image\nsharing chains on social media platforms. The system is structured as a cascade\nof backtracking blocks, each of them tracing back one step of the sharing chain\nat a time. Blocks are designed as ensembles of classifiers trained to analyse\nthe input image independently from one another by leveraging different feature\nrepresentations that describe both content and container of the media object.\nIndividual decisions are then properly combined by a late fusion strategy.\nResults highlight the advantages of employing multiple clues, which allow\naccurately tracing back up to three steps along the sharing chain.",

A single neural network (NN)\nthat optimises a global objective is generally learned in most work in FL,\nwhich could be suboptimal for edge devices. Although works finding a NN\npersonalised for edge device specific tasks exist, they lack generalisation\nand/or convergence guarantees. In this paper, a novel communication efficient\nFL algorithm for personalised learning in a wireless setting with guarantees is\npresented. The algorithm relies on finding a ``better`` empirical estimate of\nlosses at each device, using a weighted average of the losses across different\ndevices. It is devised from a Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) bound on the\ntrue loss in terms of the proposed empirical loss and is bounded by (i) the\nRademacher complexity, (ii) the discrepancy, (iii) and a penalty term. Using a\nsigned gradient feedback to find a personalised NN at each device, it is also\nproven to converge in a Rayleigh flat fading (in the uplink) channel, at a rate\nof the order max{1/SNR,1/sqrt(T)} Experimental results show that the proposed\nalgorithm outperforms locally trained devices as well as the conventionally\nused FedAvg and FedSGD algorithms under practical SNR regimes.",

When there are unseen obstacles or occluded\nvehicles in a scenario, goal recognition may be confounded by the effects of\nthese unseen entities on the behaviour of observed vehicles. Existing\nprediction algorithms that assume rational behaviour with respect to inferred\ngoals may fail to make accurate long-horizon predictions because they ignore\nthe possibility that the behaviour is influenced by such unseen entities. We\nintroduce the Goal and Occluded Factor Inference (GOFI) algorithm which bases\ninference on inverse-planning to jointly infer a probabilistic belief over\ngoals and potential occluded factors. We then show how these beliefs can be\nintegrated into Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

In this paper we\nassume that all robots are mobile and after the event is found (reported by\nsensors), the goal is to allocate the task to the most suitable robot to act\nupon the event, using either distance or the robots' remaining energy as\nmetrics. The proposed algorithms consist of two phases. The first phase of\nalgorithms is based on face routing and we introduced the parameter called\nsearch radius (SR) at the end of this first phase. Routing is considered\nsuccessful if the found robot is inside SR. After that, the second phase, based\non auctions, is initiated by the robot found in SR trying to find a more\nsuitable one. In the simulations, network lifetime and communication costs are\nmeasured and used for comparison. We compare our algorithms with two similar\nalgorithms from the literature (k-SAAP and BFS) used for the task assignment.\nRFTA2 and RFTA2GE feature up to 7 times longer network lifetime with\nsignificant communication overhead reduction compared to k-SAAP and BFS.

In this setting,\nit is shown that the optimization problem can be analytically solved in a\nvariational framework, leading to, nonlinear, closed-form algebraic solutions\nfor the characteristic function, which are then solved, in every time-step, via\nfixed point methods based on a pseudo-energy cutting algorithm combined with\nthe exact fulfillment of the constraint, at every iteration of the non-linear\nalgorithm, via a bisection method. The issue of the ill-posedness (mesh\ndependency) of the topological solution, is then easily solved via a Laplacian\nsmoothing of that pseudo-energy. In the aforementioned context, a number of\n(3D) topological structural optimization benchmarks are solved, and the\nsolutions obtained with the explored closed-form solution method, are analyzed,\nand compared, with their solution through an alternative level set method.\nAlthough the obtained results, in terms of the cost function and topology\ndesigns, are very similar in both methods, the associated computational cost is\nabout five times smaller in the closedform solution method this possibly being\none of its advantages.",

In this work, we\npropose SimpModeling, a novel sketch-based system for helping users, especially\namateur users, easily model 3D animalmorphic heads - a prevalent kind of heads\nin character design. Although sketching provides an easy way to depict desired\nshapes, it is challenging to infer dense geometric information from sparse line\ndrawings. Recently, deepnet-based approaches have been taken to address this\nchallenge and try to produce rich geometric details from very few strokes.\nHowever, while such methods reduce users' workload, they would cause less\ncontrollability of target shapes. This is mainly due to the uncertainty of the\nneural prediction. Our system tackles this issue and provides good\ncontrollability from three aspects: 1) we separate coarse shape design and\ngeometric detail specification into two stages and respectively provide\ndifferent sketching means; 2) in coarse shape designing, sketches are used for\nboth shape inference and geometric constraints to determine global geometry,\nand in geometric detail crafting, sketches are used for carving surface\ndetails; 3) in both stages, we use the advanced implicit-based shape inference\nmethods, which have strong ability to handle the domain gap between freehand\nsketches and synthetic ones used for training. Experimental results confirm the\neffectiveness of our method and the usability of our interactive system.

    "abstract": "Hybrid FSO/RF system requires an efficient FSO and RF link switching\nmechanism to improve the system capacity by realizing the complementary\nbenefits of both the links. The dynamics of network conditions, such as fog,\ndust, and sand storms compound the link switching problem and control\ncomplexity. To address this problem, we initiate the study of deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) for link switching of hybrid FSO/RF systems.\nSpecifically, in this work, we focus on actor-critic called Actor/Critic-FSO/RF\nand Deep-Q network (DQN) called DQN-FSO/RF for FSO/RF link switching under\natmospheric turbulences. To formulate the problem, we define the state, action,\nand reward function of a hybrid FSO/RF system. DQN-FSO/RF frequently updates\nthe deployed policy that interacts with the environment in a hybrid FSO/RF\nsystem, resulting in high switching costs. To overcome this, we lift this\nproblem to ensemble consensus-based representation learning for deep\nreinforcement called DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF. The proposed novel DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF\nDRL approach uses consensus learned features representations based on an\nensemble of asynchronous threads to update the deployed policy. Experimental\nresults corroborate that the proposed DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF's consensus-learned\nfeatures switching achieves better performance than Actor/Critic-FSO/RF,\nDQN-FSO/RF, and MyOpic for FSO/RF link switching while keeping the switching\ncost significantly low.",

    "abstract": "This paper targets the execution of data science (DS) pipelines supported by\ndata processing, transmission and sharing across several resources executing\ngreedy processes. Current data science pipelines environments provide various\ninfrastructure services with computing resources such as general-purpose\nprocessors (GPP), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Field Programmable Gate\nArrays (FPGAs) and Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) coupled with platform and\nsoftware services to design, run and maintain DS pipelines. These one-fits-all\nsolutions impose the complete externalization of data pipeline tasks. However,\nsome tasks can be executed in the edge, and the backend can provide just in\ntime resources to ensure ad-hoc and elastic execution environments.\nThis paper introduces an innovative composable \"Just in Time Architecture\"\nfor configuring DCs for Data Science Pipelines (JITA-4DS) and associated\nresource management techniques. JITA-4DS is a cross-layer management system\nthat is aware of both the application characteristics and the underlying\ninfrastructures to break the barriers between applications,\nmiddleware/operating system, and hardware layers. Vertical integration of these\nlayers is needed for building a customizable Virtual Data Center (VDC) to meet\nthe dynamically changing data science pipelines' requirements such as\nperformance, availability, and energy consumption. Accordingly, the paper shows\nan experimental simulation devoted to run data science workloads and determine\nthe best strategies for scheduling the allocation of resources implemented by\nJITA-4DS.",

    "abstract": "Single online handwritten Chinese character recognition~(single OLHCCR) has\nachieved prominent performance. However, in real application scenarios, users\nalways write multiple Chinese characters to form one complete sentence and the\ncontextual information within these characters holds the significant potential\nto improve the accuracy, robustness and efficiency of sentence-level OLHCCR. In\nthis work, we first propose a simple and straightforward end-to-end network,\nnamely vanilla compositional network~(VCN) to tackle the sentence-level OLHCCR.\nIt couples convolutional neural network with sequence modeling architecture to\nexploit the handwritten character's previous contextual information. Although\nVCN performs much better than the state-of-the-art single OLHCCR model, it\nexposes high fragility when confronting with not well written characters such\nas sloppy writing, missing or broken strokes. To improve the robustness of\nsentence-level OLHCCR, we further propose a novel deep spatial-temporal fusion\nnetwork~(DSTFN). It utilizes a pre-trained autoregresssive framework as the\nbackbone component, which projects each Chinese character into word embeddings,\nand integrates the spatial glyph features of handwritten characters and their\ncontextual information multiple times at multi-layer fusion module. We also\nconstruct a large-scale sentence-level handwriting dataset, named as CSOHD to\nevaluate models. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that DSTFN achieves\nthe state-of-the-art performance, which presents strong robustness compared\nwith VCN and exiting single OLHCCR models. The in-depth empirical analysis and\ncase studies indicate that DSTFN can significantly improve the efficiency of\nhandwriting input, with the handwritten Chinese character with incomplete\nstrokes being recognized precisely.",

Is there any simple but general approach that can\nexploit the existing models to further improve the quality of the imputation?\nIn this article, we aim to respond to this concern and propose a novel general\ndata augmentation method called Missingness Augmentation (MA), which can be\napplied in many existing generative imputation frameworks to further improve\nthe performance of these models. For MA, before each training epoch, we use the\noutputs of the generator to expand the incomplete samples on the fly, and then\ndetermine a special reconstruction loss for these augmented samples. This\nreconstruction loss plus the original loss constitutes the final optimization\nobjective of the model. It is noteworthy that MA is very efficient and does not\nneed to change the structure of the original model. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that MA can significantly improve the performance of many recently\ndeveloped generative imputation models on a variety of datasets.

The analysis of the runtime latency of a\nconvolutional layer shows that the two-way streaming architecture achieves\nbetter improvement than the one-way streaming architecture for an Output\nStationary (OS) dataflow architecture.

Although the\ntraditional view is that table instances must respect all functional\ndependencies imposed on them, it is nevertheless relevant to develop theories\nabout how to handle instances that violate some dependencies. The usual\napproach to alleviate the impact of inconsistent data on the answers to a query\nis to introduce the notion of repair: a repair is a minimally di?erent\nconsistent instance and an answer is consistent if it is present in every\nrepair. Our approach is fundamentally di?erent: we use set theoretic semantics\nfor tuples and functional dependencies that allow us to associate each tuple\nwith a truth value among the following: true, false, inconsistent or unknown.\nThe users of the table can then query the set of true tuples as usual.\nRegarding missing values, we make no assumptions on their existence: a missing\nvalue exists only if it is inferred from the functional dependencies of the\ntable. The main contributions of the paper are the following: (a) we introduce\na new approach to handle inconsistencies in a table with nulls and functional\ndependencies, (b) we give algorithms for computing all true, inconsistent and\nfalse tuples, (c) we discuss how our approach relates to Belnap's four valued\nlogic, (d) we de- scribe how our approach can be applied to the consolidation\nof two or more tables and (e) we discuss the relationship between our approach\nand that of table repairs.",

    "title": "Four-Valued Semantics for Deductive Databases",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to deductive databases meant to\ntake into account the needs of current applications in the area of data\nintegration. To this end, we extend the formalism of standard deductive\ndatabases to the context of Four-valued logic so as to account for unknown,\ninconsistent, true or false information under the open world assumption. In our\napproach, a database is a pair (E,R) where E is the extension and R the set of\nrules. The extension is a set of pairs of the form (f, v) where f is a fact and\nv is a value that can be true, inconsistent or false - but not unknown (that\nis, unknown facts are not stored in the database). The rules follow the form of\nstandard Datalog{neg} rules but, contrary to standard rules, their head may be\na negative atom. Our main contributions are as follows: (i) we give an\nexpression of first-degree entailment in terms of other connectors and exhibit\na functionally complete set of basic connectors not involving first-degree\nentailment, (ii) we define a new operator for handling our new type of rules\nand show that this operator is monotonic and continuous, thus providing an\neffective way for defining and computing database semantics, and (iii) we argue\nthat our framework allows for the definition of a new type of updates that can\nbe used in most standard data integration applications.",

It hides the complexity inherent to Big Data parallel\nand distributed programming and processing through built-in functions,\nunderlying parallel processes, and data management strategies. Nonetheless,\nprogrammers must cleverly combine these functions within programs and guide the\nengine to use the right data management strategies to exploit the large number\nof computational resources required by Big Data processing and avoid\nsubstantial production losses. Many programming details in data processing code\nwithin Spark programs are prone to false statements that need to be correctly\nand automatically tested. This paper explores the application of mutation\ntesting in Spark programs, a fault-based testing technique that relies on fault\nsimulation to evaluate and design test sets. The paper introduces the\nTRANSMUT-Spark solution for testing Spark programs. TRANSMUT-Spark automates\nthe most laborious steps of the process and fully executes the mutation testing\nprocess. The paper describes how the tool automates the mutants generation,\ntest execution, and adequacy analysis phases of mutation testing with\nTRANSMUT-Spark.

    "abstract": "Exploring an unknown environment without colliding with obstacles is one of\nthe essentials of autonomous vehicles to perform diverse missions such as\nstructural inspections, rescues, deliveries, and so forth. Therefore, unmanned\naerial vehicles (UAVs), which are fast, agile, and have high degrees of\nfreedom, have been widely used. However, previous approaches have two\nlimitations: a) First, they may not be appropriate for exploring large-scale\nenvironments because they mainly depend on random sampling-based path planning\nthat causes unnecessary movements. b) Second, they assume the pose estimation\nis accurate enough, which is the most critical factor in obtaining an accurate\nmap. In this paper, to explore and map unknown large-scale environments rapidly\nand accurately, we propose a novel exploration method that combines the\npre-calculated Peacock Trajectory with graph-based global exploration and\nactive loop-closing. Because the two-step trajectory that considers the\nkinodynamics of UAVs is used, obstacle avoidance is guaranteed in the\nreceding-horizon manner. In addition, local exploration that considers the\nfrontier and global exploration based on the graph maximizes the speed of\nexploration by minimizing unnecessary revisiting. In addition, by actively\nclosing the loop based on the likelihood, pose estimation performance is\nimproved. The proposed method's performance is verified by exploring 3D\nsimulation environments in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.\nFinally, the proposed approach is validated in a real-world experiment.",

    "abstract": "End-to-end intent classification using speech has numerous advantages\ncompared to the conventional pipeline approach using automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR), followed by natural language processing modules. It attempts\nto predict intent from speech without using an intermediate ASR module.\nHowever, such end-to-end framework suffers from the unavailability of large\nspeech resources with higher acoustic variation in spoken language\nunderstanding. In this work, we exploit the scope of the transformer\ndistillation method that is specifically designed for knowledge distillation\nfrom a transformer based language model to a transformer based speech model. In\nthis regard, we leverage the reliable and widely used bidirectional encoder\nrepresentations from transformers (BERT) model as a language model and transfer\nthe knowledge to build an acoustic model for intent classification using the\nspeech. In particular, a multilevel transformer based teacher-student model is\ndesigned, and knowledge distillation is performed across attention and hidden\nsub-layers of different transformer layers of the student and teacher models.\nWe achieve an intent classification accuracy of 99.10% and 88.79% for Fluent\nspeech corpus and ATIS database, respectively. Further, the proposed method\ndemonstrates better performance and robustness in acoustically degraded\ncondition compared to the baseline method.",

Traditional methods for ASD usually\noperate on each candidate's pre-cropped face track separately and do not\nsufficiently consider the relationships among the candidates. This potentially\nlimits performance, especially in challenging scenarios with low-resolution\nfaces, multiple candidates, etc. Our solution is a novel, unified framework\nthat focuses on jointly modeling multiple types of contextual information:\nspatial context to indicate the position and scale of each candidate's face,\nrelational context to capture the visual relationships among the candidates and\ncontrast audio-visual affinities with each other, and temporal context to\naggregate long-term information and smooth out local uncertainties. Based on\nsuch information, our model optimizes all candidates in a unified process for\nrobust and reliable ASD. A thorough ablation study is performed on several\nchallenging ASD benchmarks under different settings. In particular, our method\noutperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin of about 15% mean Average\nPrecision (mAP) absolute on two challenging subsets: one with three candidate\nspeakers, and the other with faces smaller than 64 pixels.

    "abstract": "Point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision. In\nthis paper, we cast point cloud registration into a planning problem in\nreinforcement learning, which can seek the transformation between the source\nand target point clouds through trial and error. By modeling the point cloud\nregistration process as a Markov decision process (MDP), we develop a latent\ndynamic model of point clouds, consisting of a transformation network and\nevaluation network. The transformation network aims to predict the new\ntransformed feature of the point cloud after performing a rigid transformation\n(i.e., action) on it while the evaluation network aims to predict the alignment\nprecision between the transformed source point cloud and target point cloud as\nthe reward signal. Once the dynamic model of the point cloud is trained, we\nemploy the cross-entropy method (CEM) to iteratively update the planning policy\nby maximizing the rewards in the point cloud registration process. Thus, the\noptimal policy, i.e., the transformation between the source and target point\nclouds, can be obtained via gradually narrowing the search space of the\ntransformation. Experimental results on ModelNet40 and 7Scene benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our method can yield good registration performance in\nan unsupervised manner.",

In this paper we first consider a specific instance of the problem\nwhich is employed in the San Martino Hospital in Genova, Italy, and present a\nsolution to the problem based on Answer Set Programming (ASP). Then, we enrich\nthe problem and the related ASP encoding considering further features often\nemployed in other hospitals, desirable also in S. Martino, and/or considered in\nrelated papers. Results of an experimental analysis, conducted on the real data\nprovided by the San Martino Hospital, show that ASP is an effective solving\nmethodology also for this important scheduling problem. Under consideration for\nacceptance in TPLP.",

On the\nother hand, when using uniform meshes, constant polynomial degree and for\nproblems with constant diffusion coefficients, the RIPDG method is identical to\nthe classical IPDG.

    "abstract": "Objective: We develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system using deep\nlearning approaches for lesion detection and classification on whole-slide\nimages (WSIs) with breast cancer. The deep features being distinguishing in\nclassification from the convolutional neural networks (CNN) are demonstrated in\nthis study to provide comprehensive interpretability for the proposed CAD\nsystem using pathological knowledge. Methods: In the experiment, a total of 186\nslides of WSIs were collected and classified into three categories:\nNon-Carcinoma, Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS), and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma\n(IDC). Instead of conducting pixel-wise classification into three classes\ndirectly, we designed a hierarchical framework with the multi-view scheme that\nperforms lesion detection for region proposal at higher magnification first and\nthen conducts lesion classification at lower magnification for each detected\nlesion. Results: The slide-level accuracy rate for three-category\nclassification reaches 90.8% (99/109) through 5-fold cross-validation and\nachieves 94.8% (73/77) on the testing set. The experimental results show that\nthe morphological characteristics and co-occurrence properties learned by the\ndeep learning models for lesion classification are accordant with the clinical\nrules in diagnosis. Conclusion: The pathological interpretability of the deep\nfeatures not only enhances the reliability of the proposed CAD system to gain\nacceptance from medical specialists, but also facilitates the development of\ndeep learning frameworks for various tasks in pathology. Significance: This\npaper presents a CAD system for pathological image analysis, which fills the\nclinical requirements and can be accepted by medical specialists with providing\nits interpretability from the pathological perspective.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks and other machine learning models compute continuous\nrepresentations, while humans communicate mostly through discrete symbols.\nReconciling these two forms of communication is desirable for generating\nhuman-readable interpretations or learning discrete latent variable models,\nwhile maintaining end-to-end differentiability. Some existing approaches (such\nas the Gumbel-Softmax transformation) build continuous relaxations that are\ndiscrete approximations in the zero-temperature limit, while others (such as\nsparsemax transformations and the Hard Concrete distribution) produce\ndiscrete/continuous hybrids. In this paper, we build rigorous theoretical\nfoundations for these hybrids, which we call \"mixed random variables.\" Our\nstarting point is a new \"direct sum\" base measure defined on the face lattice\nof the probability simplex. From this measure, we introduce new entropy and\nKullback-Leibler divergence functions that subsume the discrete and\ndifferential cases and have interpretations in terms of code optimality. Our\nframework suggests two strategies for representing and sampling mixed random\nvariables, an extrinsic (\"sample-and-project\") and an intrinsic one (based on\nface stratification). We experiment with both approaches on an emergent\ncommunication benchmark and on modeling MNIST and Fashion-MNIST data with\nvariational auto-encoders with mixed latent variables.",

    "abstract": "With various face presentation attacks arising under unseen scenarios, face\nanti-spoofing (FAS) based on domain generalization (DG) has drawn growing\nattention due to its robustness. Most existing methods utilize DG frameworks to\nalign the features to seek a compact and generalized feature space.

To address this issue, we\npropose a novel perspective of face anti-spoofing that focuses on the\nnormalization selection in the feature extraction process. Concretely, an\nAdaptive Normalized Representation Learning (ANRL) framework is devised, which\nadaptively selects feature normalization methods according to the inputs,\naiming to learn domain-agnostic and discriminative representation. Moreover, to\nfacilitate the representation learning, Dual Calibration Constraints are\ndesigned, including Inter-Domain Compatible loss and Inter-Class Separable\nloss, which provide a better optimization direction for generalizable\nrepresentation.

    "abstract": "Erasure coding (EC) affords data redundancy for large-scale systems.\nXOR-based EC is an easy-to-implement method for optimizing EC. This paper\naddresses a significant performance gap between the state-of-the-art XOR-based\nEC approach (with 4.9 GB/s coding throughput) and Intel's high-performance EC\nlibrary based on another approach (with 6.7 GB/s). We propose a novel approach\nbased on our observation that XOR-based EC virtually generates programs of a\nDomain Specific Language for XORing byte arrays. We formalize such programs as\nstraight-line programs (SLPs) of compiler construction and optimize SLPs using\nvarious optimization techniques. Our optimization flow is three-fold: 1)\nreducing operations using grammar compression algorithms; 2) reducing memory\naccesses using deforestation, a functional program optimization method; and 3)\nreducing cache misses using the (red-blue) pebble game of program analysis. We\nprovide an experimental library, which outperforms Intel's library with 8.92\nGB/s throughput.",

    "title": "Using Metamorphic Relations to Verify and Enhance Artcode Classification",
    "abstract": "Software testing is often hindered where it is impossible or impractical to\ndetermine the correctness of the behaviour or output of the software under test\n(SUT), a situation known as the oracle problem. An example of an area facing\nthe oracle problem is automatic image classification, using machine learning to\nclassify an input image as one of a set of predefined classes. An approach to\nsoftware testing that alleviates the oracle problem is metamorphic testing\n(MT). While traditional software testing examines the correctness of individual\ntest cases, MT instead examines the relations amongst multiple executions of\ntest cases and their outputs. These relations are called metamorphic relations\n(MRs): if an MR is found to be violated, then a fault must exist in the SUT.\nThis paper examines the problem of classifying images containing visually\nhidden markers called Artcodes, and applies MT to verify and enhance the\ntrained classifiers. This paper further examines two MRs, Separation and\nOcclusion, and reports on their capability in verifying the image\nclassification using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in conjunction with\nthree other statistical analysis methods: t-test (for unequal variances),\nKruskal-Wallis test, and Dunnett's test. In addition to our previously-studied\nclassifier, that used Random Forests, we introduce a new classifier that uses a\nsupport vector machine, and present its MR-augmented version. Experimental\nevaluations across a number of performance metrics show that the augmented\nclassifiers can achieve better performance than non-augmented classifiers. This\npaper also analyses how the enhanced performance is obtained.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised learning is just at a tipping point where it could really take\noff. Among these approaches, contrastive learning has seen tremendous progress\nand led to state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we construct a novel\nprobabilistic graphical model that effectively incorporates the low rank\npromoting prior into the framework of contrastive learning, referred to as\nLORAC. In contrast to the existing conventional self-supervised approaches that\nonly considers independent learning, our hypothesis explicitly requires that\nall the samples belonging to the same instance class lie on the same subspace\nwith small dimension. This heuristic poses particular joint learning\nconstraints to reduce the degree of freedom of the problem during the search of\nthe optimal network parameterization. Most importantly, we argue that the low\nrank prior employed here is not unique, and many different priors can be\ninvoked in a similar probabilistic way, corresponding to different hypotheses\nabout underlying truth behind the contrastive features. Empirical evidences\nshow that the proposed algorithm clearly surpasses the state-of-the-art\napproaches on multiple benchmarks, including image classification, object\ndetection, instance segmentation and keypoint detection.",

Moreover, documents retrieved by search engines might\nnot contain solutions containing both code examples and their explanations. So,\nwe propose CRAR (Crowd Answer Recommender) to circumvent those issues aiming at\nimproving retrieval of relevant answers from Stack Overflow containing not only\nthe expected code examples for the given task but also their explanations.\nGiven a programming task, we investigate the effectiveness of combining\ninformation retrieval techniques along with a set of features to enhance the\nranking of important threads (i.e., the units containing questions along with\ntheir answers) for the given task and then selects relevant answers contained\nin those threads, including semantic features, like word embeddings and\nsentence embeddings, for instance, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CRAR\nalso leverages social aspects of Stack Overflow discussions like popularity to\nselect relevant answers for the tasks.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of automated facial recognition in various commercial and\ngovernment sectors has caused significant privacy concerns for individuals. A\nrecent and popular approach to address these privacy concerns is to employ\nevasion attacks against the metric embedding networks powering facial\nrecognition systems. Face obfuscation systems generate imperceptible\nperturbations, when added to an image, cause the facial recognition system to\nmisidentify the user. The key to these approaches is the generation of\nperturbations using a pre-trained metric embedding network followed by their\napplication to an online system, whose model might be proprietary. This\ndependence of face obfuscation on metric embedding networks, which are known to\nbe unfair in the context of facial recognition, surfaces the question of\ndemographic fairness -- \\textit{are there demographic disparities in the\nperformance of face obfuscation systems?} To address this question, we perform\nan analytical and empirical exploration of the performance of recent face\nobfuscation systems that rely on deep embedding networks. We find that metric\nembedding networks are demographically aware; they cluster faces in the\nembedding space based on their demographic attributes. We observe that this\neffect carries through to the face obfuscation systems: faces belonging to\nminority groups incur reduced utility compared to those from majority groups.\nFor example, the disparity in average obfuscation success rate on the online\nFace++ API can reach up to 20 percentage points. Further, for some demographic\ngroups, the average perturbation size increases by up to 17\\% when choosing a\ntarget identity belonging to a different demographic group versus the same\ndemographic group.

Expecting non-IID data\ndistribution, we focus on the issue of accelerating the learning of a\nparticular class of critical object (CO), that may harm the nominal operation\nof an autonomous vehicle. This can be done through proper allocation of the\nwireless resources for addressing learner and data heterogeneity. Thus, we\npropose a reactive method for the allocation of wireless resources, that\nhappens dynamically each FL round, and is based on each learner's contribution\nto the general model. In addition to this, we explore the use of static methods\nthat remain constant across all rounds. Since we expect partial work from each\nlearner, we use the FedProx FL algorithm, in the task of computer vision. For\ntesting, we construct a non-IID data distribution of the MNIST and FMNIST\ndatasets among four types of learners, in scenarios that represent the quickly\nchanging environment. The results show that proactive measures are effective\nand versatile at improving system accuracy, and quickly learning the CO class\nwhen underrepresented in the network.

We propose a behavior-based, unsupervised\nframework comprising two methods of lateral movement detection on enterprise\nnetworks: one aimed at generic lateral movement via either exploit or\nauthenticated connections, and one targeting the specific techniques of process\ninjection and hijacking. The first method is based on the premise that the role\nof a system---the functions it performs on the network---determines the roles\nof the systems it should make connections with. The adversary meanwhile might\nmove between any systems whatever, possibly seeking out systems with unusual\nroles that facilitate certain accesses. We use unsupervised learning to cluster\nsystems according to role and identify connections to systems with novel roles\nas potentially malicious. The second method is based on the premise that the\ntemporal patterns of inter-system processes that facilitate these connections\ndepend on the roles of the systems involved. If a process is compromised by an\nattacker, these normal patterns might be disrupted in discernible ways.

Although mmWave\ncellular systems can carry a larger volume of traffic, dense deployment, in\nturn, increases the BS installation and maintenance cost, which has been\nlargely ignored in their utilization. In this paper, we present an approach to\nthe problem of mmWave BS deployment in urban environments by minimizing BS\ndeployment cost subject to BS association and user equipment (UE) outage\nconstraints. By exploiting the macro diversity, which enables each UE to be\nassociated with multiple BSs, we derive an expression for UE outage that\nintegrates physical blockage, UE access-limited blockage, and\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) outage into its expression. The\nminimum-cost BS deployment problem is then formulated as integer non-linear\nprogramming (INP). The combinatorial nature of the problem motivates the\npursuit of the optimal solution by decomposing the original problem into the\ntwo separable subproblems, i.e., cell coverage optimization and minimum subset\nselection subproblems. We provide the optimal solution and theoretical\njustifications for each subproblem. The simulation results demonstrating UE\noutage guarantees of the proposed method are presented.

Conventional methods assign close instance\npairs in the feature space with high similarity, which usually leads to wrong\npairwise relationship for large neighborhoods because the Euclidean distance\nfails to depict the true semantic similarity on the feature manifold. On the\ncontrary, our method mines the feature manifold in an unsupervised manner,\nthrough which the semantic similarity among instances is learned in order to\nobtain discriminative representations. Specifically, we employ the Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GAN) to mine the underlying feature manifold, where the\ngenerated features are applied as the proxies to progressively explore the\nfeature manifold so that the semantic similarity among instances is acquired as\nreliable pseudo supervision. Extensive experiments on image classification\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method compared with the state-of-the-art\nmethods.

    "title": "Video Contrastive Learning with Global Context",
    "abstract": "Contrastive learning has revolutionized self-supervised image representation\nlearning field, and recently been adapted to video domain. One of the greatest\nadvantages of contrastive learning is that it allows us to flexibly define\npowerful loss objectives as long as we can find a reasonable way to formulate\npositive and negative samples to contrast. However, existing approaches rely\nheavily on the short-range spatiotemporal salience to form clip-level\ncontrastive signals, thus limit themselves from using global context. In this\npaper, we propose a new video-level contrastive learning method based on\nsegments to formulate positive pairs. Our formulation is able to capture global\ncontext in a video, thus robust to temporal content change. We also incorporate\na temporal order regularization term to enforce the inherent sequential\nstructure of videos. Extensive experiments show that our video-level\ncontrastive learning framework (VCLR) is able to outperform previous\nstate-of-the-arts on five video datasets for downstream action classification,\naction localization and video retrieval.

To assist advertisers in navigating such\nthird party libraries, we study the problem of automatically fetching relevant\nad images given the ad text (via a short textual query for images). Motivated\nby our observations in logged data on ad image search queries (given ad text),\nwe formulate a keyword extraction problem, where a keyword extracted from the\nad text (or its augmented version) serves as the ad image query. In this\ncontext, we propose VisualTextRank: an unsupervised method to (i) augment input\nad text using semantically similar ads, and (ii) extract the image query from\nthe augmented ad text. VisualTextRank builds on prior work on graph based\ncontext extraction (biased TextRank in particular) by leveraging both the text\nand image of similar ads for better keyword extraction, and using advertiser\ncategory specific biasing with sentence-BERT embeddings. Using data collected\nfrom the Verizon Media Native (Yahoo Gemini) ad platform's stock image search\nfeature for onboarding advertisers, we demonstrate the superiority of\nVisualTextRank compared to competitive keyword extraction baselines (including\nan $11\\%$ accuracy lift over biased TextRank). For the case when the stock\nimage library is restricted to English queries, we show the effectiveness of\nVisualTextRank on multilingual ads (translated to English) while leveraging\nsemantically similar English ads.

    "abstract": "One of the challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is\ndesigning efficient learning algorithms for a large system in which each agent\nhas only limited or partial information of the entire system. In this system,\nit is desirable to learn policies of a decentralized type. A recent and\npromising paradigm to analyze such decentralized MARL is to take network\nstructures into consideration. While exciting progress has been made to analyze\ndecentralized MARL with the network of agents, often found in social networks\nand team video games, little is known theoretically for decentralized MARL with\nthe network of states, frequently used for modeling self-driving vehicles,\nride-sharing, and data and traffic routing.\nThis paper proposes a framework called localized training and decentralized\nexecution to study MARL with network of states, with homogeneous (a.k.a.\nmean-field type) agents. Localized training means that agents only need to\ncollect local information in their neighboring states during the training\nphase; decentralized execution implies that, after the training stage, agents\ncan execute the learned decentralized policies, which only requires knowledge\nof the agents' current states. The key idea is to utilize the homogeneity of\nagents and regroup them according to their states, thus the formulation of a\nnetworked Markov decision process with teams of agents, enabling the update of\nthe Q-function in a localized fashion. In order to design an efficient and\nscalable reinforcement learning algorithm under such a framework, we adopt the\nactor-critic approach with over-parameterized neural networks, and establish\nthe convergence and sample complexity for our algorithm, shown to be scalable\nwith respect to the size of both agents and states.",

To this end, we formulate and solve a constrained optimization\nproblem that simultaneously selects the most appropriate strategy for a given\ntarget team, and optimizes the constituents of its coalitions accordingly.

At the same time, current economic methodology is limited by a lack of\ncounterfactual data, simplistic behavioral models, and limited opportunities to\nexperiment with policies and evaluate behavioral responses. Here we show that\nmachine-learning-based economic simulation is a powerful policy and mechanism\ndesign framework to overcome these limitations. The AI Economist is a\ntwo-level, deep RL framework that trains both agents and a social planner who\nco-adapt, providing a tractable solution to the highly unstable and novel\ntwo-level RL challenge. From a simple specification of an economy, we learn\nrational agent behaviors that adapt to learned planner policies and vice versa.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of the AI Economist on the problem of optimal\ntaxation. In simple one-step economies, the AI Economist recovers the optimal\ntax policy of economic theory. In complex, dynamic economies, the AI Economist\nsubstantially improves both utilitarian social welfare and the trade-off\nbetween equality and productivity over baselines. It does so despite emergent\ntax-gaming strategies, while accounting for agent interactions and behavioral\nchange more accurately than economic theory.

Thus, approaches\nsuch as epoch-based reclamation (EBR), hazard pointers (HP), or a combination\nthereof have received significant attention. EBR exhibits excellent performance\nbut is blocking due to potentially unbounded memory usage. In contrast, HP are\nnon-blocking and achieve good memory efficiency but are much slower. Moreover,\nHP are only lock-free in the general case. Recently, several new memory\nreclamation approaches such as WFE and Hyaline have been proposed. WFE achieves\nwait-freedom, but is less memory efficient and suffers from suboptimal\nperformance in oversubscribed scenarios; Hyaline achieves higher performance\nand memory efficiency, but lacks wait-freedom.\nWe present a new wait-free memory reclamation scheme, Crystalline, that\nsimultaneously addresses the challenges of high performance, high memory\nefficiency, and wait-freedom. Crystalline guarantees complete wait-freedom even\nwhen threads are dynamically recycled, asynchronously reclaims memory in the\nsense that any thread can reclaim memory retired by any other thread, and\nensures (an almost) balanced reclamation workload across all threads. The\nlatter two properties result in Crystalline's high performance and high memory\nefficiency. Simultaneously ensuring all three properties require overcoming\nunique challenges which we discuss in the paper.\nCrystalline's implementation relies on specialized instructions which are\nwidely available on commodity hardware such as x86-64 or ARM64.

The decoupling allows for\npart of the representation computation to be performed offline and cached for\nonline use. To retain the decoupled transformer accuracy, we devised a\nknowledge distillation objective from a standard transformer model. Moreover,\nwe introduce learned representation compression layers which help reduce by\nfour times the storage requirement for the cache. In experiments on the SQUAD\n2.0 dataset, a decoupled transformer reduces the computational cost and latency\nof open-domain MRC by 30-40% with only 1.2 points worse F1-score compared to a\nstandard transformer.",

Specifically, heterogeneous multi-robot systems must answer three\nimportant questions: \\textit{who} (task allocation), \\textit{when}\n(scheduling), and \\textit{how} (motion planning). While specific variants of\neach of these problems are known to be NP-Hard, their interdependence only\nexacerbates the challenges involved in solving them together. In this paper, we\npresent a novel framework that interleaves task allocation, scheduling, and\nmotion planning. We introduce a search-based approach for trait-based\ntime-extended task allocation named Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search\n(ITAGS). In contrast to approaches that solve the three problems in sequence,\nITAGS's interleaved approach enables efficient search for allocations while\nsimultaneously satisfying scheduling constraints and accounting for the time\ntaken to execute motion plans. To enable effective interleaving, we develop a\nconvex combination of two search heuristics that optimizes the satisfaction of\ntask requirements as well as the makespan of the associated schedule.

    "abstract": "In network inference applications, it is often desirable to detect community\nstructure, namely to cluster vertices into groups, or blocks, according to some\nmeasure of similarity. Beyond mere adjacency matrices, many real networks also\ninvolve vertex covariates that carry key information about underlying block\nstructure in graphs. To assess the effects of such covariates on block\nrecovery, we present a comparative analysis of two model-based spectral\nalgorithms for clustering vertices in stochastic blockmodel graphs with vertex\ncovariates. The first algorithm uses only the adjacency matrix, and directly\nestimates the block assignments. The second algorithm incorporates both the\nadjacency matrix and the vertex covariates into the estimation of block\nassignments, and moreover quantifies the explicit impact of the vertex\ncovariates on the resulting estimate of the block assignments. We employ\nChernoff information to analytically compare the algorithms' performance and\nderive the information-theoretic Chernoff ratio for certain models of interest.\nAnalytic results and simulations suggest that the second algorithm is often\npreferred: we can often better estimate the induced block assignments by first\nestimating the effect of vertex covariates. In addition, real data examples\nalso indicate that the second algorithm has the advantages of revealing\nunderlying block structure and taking observed vertex heterogeneity into\naccount in real applications. Our findings emphasize the importance of\ndistinguishing between observed and unobserved factors that can affect block\nstructure in graphs.",

In this paper, we study two related aspects of this correspondence.\nFirst, we comment on the concepts of locality and power-counting in this\ncontext. Indeed, these usual space-time notions may not hold for neural\nnetworks (since inputs can be arbitrary), however, the renormalization group\nprovides natural notions of locality and scaling. Moreover, we comment on\nseveral subtleties, for example, that data components may not have a\npermutation symmetry: in that case, we argue that random tensor field theories\ncould provide a natural generalization. Second, we improve the perturbative\nWilsonian renormalization from arXiv:2008.08601 by providing an analysis in\nterms of the nonperturbative renormalization group using the Wetterich-Morris\nequation. An important difference with usual nonperturbative RG analysis is\nthat only the effective (IR) 2-point function is known, which requires setting\nthe problem with care. Our aim is to provide a useful formalism to investigate\nneural networks behavior beyond the large-width limit (i.e.~far from Gaussian\nlimit) in a nonperturbative fashion. A major result of our analysis is that\nchanging the standard deviation of the neural network weight distribution can\nbe interpreted as a renormalization flow in the space of networks.

Though this trade-off has been studied for\nmulti-armed bandits, reinforcement learning (RL) for finite Markov chains, and\nRL for linear control systems; it is less well-studied for learning-based\ncontrol of nonlinear control systems. A significant theoretical challenge in\nthe nonlinear setting is that, unlike the linear case, there is no explicit\ncharacterization of an optimal controller for a given set of cost and system\nparameters. We propose in this paper the use of a finite-horizon oracle\ncontroller with perfect knowledge of all system parameters as a reference for\noptimal control actions. First, this allows us to propose a new regret notion\nwith respect to this oracle finite-horizon controller. Second, this allows us\nto develop learning-based policies that we prove achieve low regret (i.e.,\nsquare-root regret up to a log-squared factor) with respect to this oracle\nfinite-horizon controller. This policy is developed in the context of\nlearning-based model predictive control (LBMPC).

    "abstract": "Fourier single-pixel imaging (FSI) is a branch of single-pixel imaging\ntechniques. It uses Fourier basis patterns as structured patterns for spatial\ninformation acquisition in the Fourier domain. However, the spatial resolution\nof the image reconstructed by FSI mainly depends on the number of Fourier\ncoefficients sampled. The reconstruction of a high-resolution image typically\nrequires a number of Fourier coefficients to be sampled, and therefore takes a\nlong data acquisition time. Here we propose a new sampling strategy for FSI. It\nallows FSI to reconstruct a clear and sharp image with a reduced number of\nmeasurements. The core of the proposed sampling strategy is to perform a\nvariable density sampling in the Fourier space and, more importantly, the\ndensity with respect to the importance of Fourier coefficients is subject to a\none-dimensional Gaussian function. Combined with compressive sensing, the\nproposed sampling strategy enables better reconstruction quality than\nconventional sampling strategies, especially when the sampling ratio is low. We\nexperimentally demonstrate compressive FSI combined with the proposed sampling\nstrategy is able to reconstruct a sharp and clear image of 256-by-256 pixels\nwith a sampling ratio of 10%. The proposed method enables fast single-pixel\nimaging and provides a new approach for efficient spatial information\nacquisition.",

    "abstract": "Accurate forecasting of traffic conditions is critical for improving safety,\nstability, and efficiency of a city transportation system. In reality, it is\nchallenging to produce accurate traffic forecasts due to the complex and\ndynamic spatiotemporal correlations. Most existing works only consider partial\ncharacteristics and features of traffic data, and result in unsatisfactory\nperformances on modeling and forecasting. In this paper, we propose a periodic\nspatial-temporal deep neural network (PSTN) with three pivotal modules to\nimprove the forecasting performance of traffic conditions through a novel\nintegration of three types of information. First, the historical traffic\ninformation is folded and fed into a module consisting of a graph convolutional\nnetwork and a temporal convolutional network. Second, the recent traffic\ninformation together with the historical output passes through the second\nmodule consisting of a graph convolutional network and a gated recurrent unit\nframework. Finally, a multi-layer perceptron is applied to process the\nauxiliary road attributes and output the final predictions. Experimental\nresults on two publicly accessible real-world urban traffic data sets show that\nthe proposed PSTN outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmarks by significant\nmargins for short-term traffic conditions forecasting",

    "abstract": "Linear layouts are a graph visualization method that can be used to capture\nan entry pattern in an adjacency matrix of a given graph. By reordering the\nnode indices of the original adjacency matrix, linear layouts provide knowledge\nof latent graph structures. Conventional linear layout methods commonly aim to\nfind an optimal reordering solution based on predefined features of a given\nmatrix and loss function. However, prior knowledge of the appropriate features\nto use or structural patterns in a given adjacency matrix is not always\navailable. In such a case, performing the reordering based on data-driven\nfeature extraction without assuming a specific structure in an adjacency matrix\nis preferable. Recently, a neural-network-based matrix reordering method called\nDeepTMR has been proposed to perform this function. However, it is limited to a\ntwo-mode reordering (i.e., the rows and columns are reordered separately) and\nit cannot be applied in the one-mode setting (i.e., the same node order is used\nfor reordering both rows and columns), owing to the characteristics of its\nmodel architecture. In this study, we extend DeepTMR and propose a new one-mode\nlinear layout method referred to as AutoLL. We developed two types of neural\nnetwork models, AutoLL-D and AutoLL-U, for reordering directed and undirected\nnetworks, respectively. To perform one-mode reordering, these AutoLL models\nhave specific encoder architectures, which extract node features from an\nobserved adjacency matrix.

    "abstract": "Unlike tic-tac-toe or checkers, in which optimal play leads to a draw, it is\nnot known whether optimal play in chess ends in a win for White, a win for\nBlack, or a draw. But after White moves first in chess, if Black has a double\nmove followed by a double move of White and then alternating play, play is more\nbalanced because White does not always tie or lead in moves. Symbolically,\nBalanced Alternation gives the following move sequence: After White's (W)\ninitial move, first Black (B) and then White each have two moves in a row\n(BBWW), followed by the alternating sequence, beginning with W, which\naltogether can be written as WB/BW/WB/WB/WB... (the slashes separate\nalternating pairs of moves). Except for reversal of the 3rd and 4th moves from\nWB to BW, this is the standard chess sequence. Because Balanced Alternation\nlies between the standard sequence, which favors White, and a comparable\nsequence that favors Black, it is highly likely to produce a draw with optimal\nplay, rendering chess fairer.

    "abstract": "Recently, much progress has been made in unsupervised restoration learning.\nHowever, existing methods more or less rely on some assumptions on the signal\nand/or degradation model, which limits their practical performance. How to\nconstruct an optimal criterion for unsupervised restoration learning without\nany prior knowledge on the degradation model is still an open question. Toward\nanswering this question, this work proposes a criterion for unsupervised\nrestoration learning based on the optimal transport theory. This criterion has\nfavorable properties, e.g., approximately maximal preservation of the\ninformation of the signal, whilst achieving perceptual reconstruction.\nFurthermore, though a relaxed unconstrained formulation is used in practical\nimplementation, we show that the relaxed formulation in theory has the same\nsolution as the original constrained formulation. Experiments on synthetic and\nreal-world data, including realistic photographic, microscopy, depth, and raw\ndepth images, demonstrate that the proposed method even compares favorably with\nsupervised methods, e.g., approaching the PSNR of supervised methods while\nhaving better perceptual quality. Particularly, for spatially correlated noise\nand realistic microscopy images, the proposed method not only achieves better\nperceptual quality but also has higher PSNR than supervised methods.

    "title": "Application of hypercomplex number system in the dynamic network model",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the direction of the study of networks in which connections\ncorrespond to the mutual influences of nodes has been developed. Many works\nhave been devoted to the study of such complex networks, but most often they\nrelate to the spread of one type of activity (influence). In the process of\ndevelopment of the newest technologies various mathematical models are\ndeveloped and investigated: models with thresholds, models of independent\ncascades, models of distribution of epidemics, models of Markov processes.\nThe paper proposes to use hypercomplex number systems, which are a\nmathematical apparatus that allows you to model some network problems and solve\nthem at a new level, ie to consider a complex network with several properties\nin each node. In this paper, we consider networks where the edges correspond to\nthe mutual influences of the nodes. It is proposed to match the number of\nproperties in each node and the measurability of a hypercomplex number\nsystem(HNS) with the same number of basic elements. Each HNS corresponds to the\nKelly table, which corresponds to the law of multiplication of these CSF. The\nproperties of the CSF allow you to build an isomorphic transition from a filled\nKelly table to a less filled one, which simplifies the calculation.\nTo model the problem using hypercomplex number systems, we offer a\nspecialized software package of hypercomplex computations based on the system\nof computer algebra Maple. All this made it easy to model a complex system with\nseveral effects.",

The method\nconsiders all possible combinations of chronologically ordered products of\nadjacency matrices of the network snapshots and by means of a damping procedure\nfavors the paths that have high communication efficiency. We apply the method\nto four real-world networks of face-to-face human contacts and identify the\nnodes with high communicability. The accuracy of the method is proved by\nstudying the spread of an epidemic in the networks using the\nsusceptible-infected-recovered model. We show that if a node with high\nbroadcast is chosen as the origin of the outbreak of infection then the\nepidemic spreads early while it is delayed and inhibited if the origin of\ninfection is a node with low broadcast. Receiving nodes can be treated as\nbroadcasters if the arrow of time is reversed.",

    "abstract": "Comparing the differences in outcomes (that is, in \"dependent variables\")\nbetween two subpopulations is often most informative when comparing outcomes\nonly for individuals from the subpopulations who are similar according to\n\"independent variables.\" The independent variables are generally known as\n\"scores,\" as in propensity scores for matching or as in the probabilities\npredicted by statistical or machine-learned models, for example. If the\noutcomes are discrete, then some averaging is necessary to reduce the noise\narising from the outcomes varying randomly over those discrete values in the\nobserved data. The traditional method of averaging is to bin the data according\nto the scores and plot the average outcome in each bin against the average\nscore in the bin. However, such binning can be rather arbitrary and yet greatly\nimpacts the interpretation of displayed deviation between the subpopulations\nand assessment of its statistical significance. Fortunately, such binning is\nentirely unnecessary in plots of cumulative differences and in the associated\nscalar summary metrics that are analogous to the workhorse statistics of\ncomparing probability distributions -- those due to Kolmogorov and Smirnov and\ntheir refinements due to Kuiper. The present paper develops such cumulative\nmethods for the common case in which no score of any member of the\nsubpopulations being compared is exactly equal to the score of any other member\nof either subpopulation.",

    "abstract": "We consider ill-posed inverse problems where the forward operator $T$ is\nunknown, and instead we have access to training data consisting of functions\n$f_i$ and their noisy images $Tf_i$. This is a practically relevant and\nchallenging problem which current methods are able to solve only under strong\nassumptions on the training set. Here we propose a new method that requires\nminimal assumptions on the data, and prove reconstruction rates that depend on\nthe number of training points and the noise level. We show that, in the regime\nof \"many\" training data, the method is minimax optimal. The proposed method\nemploys a type of convolutional neural networks (U-nets) and empirical risk\nminimization in order to \"fit\" the unknown operator. In a nutshell, our\napproach is based on two ideas: the first is to relate U-nets to multiscale\ndecompositions such as wavelets, thereby linking them to the existing theory,\nand the second is to use the hierarchical structure of U-nets and the low\nnumber of parameters of convolutional neural nets to prove entropy bounds that\nare practically useful. A significant difference with the existing works on\nneural networks in nonparametric statistics is that we use them to approximate\noperators and not functions, which we argue is mathematically more natural and\ntechnically more convenient.",

This paper presents an audio captioning system with an\nencoder-decoder architecture, where the decoder predicts words based on audio\nfeatures extracted by the encoder. To improve the proposed system, transfer\nlearning from either an upstream audio-related task or a large in-domain\ndataset is introduced to mitigate the problem induced by data scarcity.\nBesides, evaluation metrics are incorporated into the optimization of the model\nwith reinforcement learning, which helps address the problem of ``exposure\nbias'' induced by ``teacher forcing'' training strategy and the mismatch\nbetween the evaluation metrics and the loss function. The resulting system was\nranked 3rd in DCASE 2021 Task 6. Ablation studies are carried out to\ninvestigate how much each element in the proposed system can contribute to\nfinal performance. The results show that the proposed techniques significantly\nimprove the scores of the evaluation metrics, however, reinforcement learning\nmay impact adversely on the quality of the generated captions.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents Sinsy, a deep neural network (DNN)-based singing voice\nsynthesis (SVS) system. In recent years, DNNs have been utilized in statistical\nparametric SVS systems, and DNN-based SVS systems have demonstrated better\nperformance than conventional hidden Markov model-based ones. SVS systems are\nrequired to synthesize a singing voice with pitch and timing that strictly\nfollow a given musical score. Additionally, singing expressions that are not\ndescribed on the musical score, such as vibrato and timing fluctuations, should\nbe reproduced. The proposed system is composed of four modules: a time-lag\nmodel, a duration model, an acoustic model, and a vocoder, and singing voices\ncan be synthesized taking these characteristics of singing voices into account.\nTo better model a singing voice, the proposed system incorporates improved\napproaches to modeling pitch and vibrato and better training criteria into the\nacoustic model. In addition, we incorporated PeriodNet, a non-autoregressive\nneural vocoder with robustness for the pitch, into our systems to generate a\nhigh-fidelity singing voice waveform. Moreover, we propose automatic pitch\ncorrection techniques for DNN-based SVS to synthesize singing voices with\ncorrect pitch even if the training data has out-of-tune phrases. Experimental\nresults show our system can synthesize a singing voice with better timing, more\nnatural vibrato, and correct pitch, and it can achieve better mean opinion\nscores in subjective evaluation tests.",
