    "abstract": "We consider a nonlocal evolution equation representing the continuum limit of\na large ensemble of interacting particles on graphs forced by noise. The two\nprinciple ingredients of the continuum model are a nonlocal term and Q-Wiener\nprocess describing the interactions among the particles in the network and\nstochastic forcing respectively. The network connectivity is given by a square\nintegrable function called a graphon.\nWe prove that the initial value problem for the continuum model is\nwell-posed. Further, we construct a semidiscrete (discrete in space and\ncontinuous in time) and a fully discrete schemes for the nonlocal model. The\nformer is obtained by a discontinuous Galerkin method and the latter is based\non further discretizing time using the Euler-Maruyama method. We prove\nconvergence and estimate the rate of convergence in each case. For the\nsemidiscrete scheme, the rate of convergence estimate is expressed in terms of\nthe regularity of the graphon, Q-Wiener process, and the initial data. We work\nin generalized Lipschitz spaces, which allows to treat models with data of\nlower regularity. This is important for applications as many interesting types\nof connectivity including small-world and power-law are expressed by graphons\nthat are not smooth. The error analysis of the fully discrete scheme, on the\nother hand, reveals that for some models common in applied science, one has a\nhigher speed of convergence than that predicted by the standard estimates for\nthe Euler-Maruyama method. The rate of convergence analysis is supplemented\nwith detailed numerical experiments, which are consistent with our analytical\nresults.\nAs a by-product, this work presents a rigorous justification for taking\ncontinuum limit for a large class of interacting dynamical systems on graphs\nsubject to noise.",

    "title": "Understanding the factors driving the opioid epidemic using machine  learning",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the US has experienced an opioid epidemic with an\nunprecedented number of drugs overdose deaths. Research finds such overdose\ndeaths are linked to neighborhood-level traits, thus providing opportunity to\nidentify effective interventions. Typically, techniques such as Ordinary Least\nSquares (OLS) or Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) are used to document\nneighborhood-level factors significant in explaining such adverse outcomes.\nThese techniques are, however, less equipped to ascertain non-linear\nrelationships between confounding factors. Hence, in this study we apply\nmachine learning based techniques to identify opioid risks of neighborhoods in\nDelaware and explore the correlation of these factors using Shapley Additive\nexplanations (SHAP). We discovered that the factors related to neighborhoods\nenvironment, followed by education and then crime, were highly correlated with\nhigher opioid risk. We also explored the change in these correlations over the\nyears to understand the changing dynamics of the epidemic. Furthermore, we\ndiscovered that, as the epidemic has shifted from legal (i.e., prescription\nopioids) to illegal (e.g.,heroin and fentanyl) drugs in recent years, the\ncorrelation of environment, crime and health related variables with the opioid\nrisk has increased significantly while the correlation of economic and\nsocio-demographic variables has decreased. The correlation of education related\nfactors has been higher from the start and has increased slightly in recent\nyears suggesting a need for increased awareness about the opioid epidemic.",

    "abstract": "We present a new multi-objective optimization approach for synthesizing\ninterpretations that \"explain\" the behavior of black-box machine learning\nmodels. Constructing human-understandable interpretations for black-box models\noften requires balancing conflicting objectives. A simple interpretation may be\neasier to understand for humans while being less precise in its predictions\nvis-a-vis a complex interpretation. Existing methods for synthesizing\ninterpretations use a single objective function and are often optimized for a\nsingle class of interpretations. In contrast, we provide a more general and\nmulti-objective synthesis framework that allows users to choose (1) the class\nof syntactic templates from which an interpretation should be synthesized, and\n(2) quantitative measures on both the correctness and explainability of an\ninterpretation. For a given black-box, our approach yields a set of\nPareto-optimal interpretations with respect to the correctness and\nexplainability measures. We show that the underlying multi-objective\noptimization problem can be solved via a reduction to quantitative constraint\nsolving, such as weighted maximum satisfiability. To demonstrate the benefits\nof our approach, we have applied it to synthesize interpretations for black-box\nneural-network classifiers. Our experiments show that there often exists a rich\nand varied set of choices for interpretations that are missed by existing\napproaches.",

Our starting point is the formulation of federated\nlearning as a multi-criterion objective, where the goal is to minimize each\nclient's loss using information from all of the clients. We propose a linear\nregression model, where, for a given client, we theoretically compare the\nperformance of various algorithms in the high-dimensional asymptotic limit.\nThis asymptotic multi-criterion approach naturally models the high-dimensional,\nmany-device nature of federated learning and suggests that personalization is\ncentral to federated learning. Our theory suggests that Fine-tuned Federated\nAveraging (FTFA), i.e., Federated Averaging followed by local training, and the\nridge regularized variant Ridge-tuned Federated Averaging (RTFA) are\ncompetitive with more sophisticated meta-learning and proximal-regularized\napproaches. In addition to being conceptually simpler, FTFA and RTFA are\ncomputationally more efficient than its competitors.

This process is called iterative learning control (ILC). This article\ndevelops a method to apply ILC to systems with nonlinear discrete-time\ndynamical models with unstable inverses (i.e. discrete-time nonlinear\nnon-minimum phase models). This class of systems includes piezoactuators,\nelectric power converters, and manipulators with flexible links, which may be\nfound in nanopositioning stages, rolling mills, and robotic arms, respectively.\nAs these devices may be required to execute fine transient reference tracking\ntasks repetitively in contexts such as manufacturing, they may benefit from\nILC. Specifically, this article facilitates ILC of such systems by presenting a\nnew ILC synthesis framework that allows combination of the principles of\nNewton's root finding algorithm with stable inversion, a technique for\ngenerating stable trajectories from unstable models. The new framework, called\nInvert-Linearize ILC (ILILC), is validated in simulation on a cart-and-pendulum\nsystem with model error, process noise, and measurement noise. Where\npreexisting Newton-based ILC diverges, ILILC with stable inversion converges,\nand does so in less than one third the number of trials necessary for the\nconvergence of a gradient-descent-based ILC technique used as a benchmark.",

Golay and Shapiro independently devised a\nrecursive construction that produces families of complementary pairs of binary\nsequences. In the simplest case, the construction produces the Rudin-Shapiro\nsequences, and in general it produces what we call Golay-Rudin-Shapiro\nsequences. Calculations by Littlewood show that the Rudin-Shapiro sequences\nhave low mean square autocorrelation. A sequence's peak sidelobe level is its\nlargest magnitude of autocorrelation over all nonzero shifts. H{\\o}holdt,\nJensen, and Justesen showed that there is some undetermined positive constant\n$A$ such that the peak sidelobe level of a Rudin-Shapiro sequence of length\n$2^n$ is bounded by $A(1.842626\\ldots)^n$, where $1.842626\\ldots$ is the\npositive real root of $X^4-3 X-6$.

    "abstract": "Patankar-type schemes are linearly implicit time integration methods designed\nto be unconditionally positivity-preserving by going outside of the class of\ngeneral linear methods. Thus, classical stability concepts cannot be applied\nand there is no satisfying stability theory for these schemes. We develop a new\napproach to study stability properties of Patankar-type methods. In particular,\nwe demonstrate problematic behavior of these methods that can lead to undesired\noscillations or order reduction. Extreme cases of the latter manifest as\nspurious steady states. We investigate various classes of Patankar-type schemes\nbased on classical Runge-Kutta methods, strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta\nmethods, and deferred correction schemes using our approach. Finally, we\nstrengthen our analysis with challenging applications including stiff nonlinear\nproblems.",

However, two properties of self-stabilization\ntheory, convergence and closure, may not be satisfied if agents are selfish. To\nguarantee convergence, we formulate the problem as a stochastic Bayesian game\nand introduce probabilistic self-stabilization to adjust the probabilities of\nrules with behavior strategies. This satisfies agents' self-interests such that\nno agent deviates the rules. To guarantee closure in the presence of selfish\nagents, we propose fault-containment as a method to constrain legitimate\nconfigurations of the self-stabilizing system to be Nash equilibria. We also\nassume selfish agents as capable of performing unauthorized actions at any\ntime, which threatens both properties, and present a stepwise solution to\nhandle it. As a case study, we consider the problem of distributed clustering\nand propose five self-stabilizing algorithms for forming clusters.

    "abstract": "A promising approach for speech dereverberation is based on supervised\nlearning, where a deep neural network (DNN) is trained to predict the direct\nsound from noisy-reverberant speech. This data-driven approach is based on\nleveraging prior knowledge of clean speech patterns and does not explicitly\nexploit the linear-filter structure in reverberation, i.e., that reverberation\nresults from a linear convolution between a room impulse response (RIR) and a\ndry source signal. In this work, we propose to exploit this linear-filter\nstructure within a deep learning based monaural speech dereverberation\nframework. The key idea is to first estimate the direct-path signal of the\ntarget speaker using a DNN and then identify signals that are decayed and\ndelayed copies of the estimated direct-path signal, as these can be reliably\nconsidered as reverberation. They can be either directly removed for\ndereverberation, or used as extra features for another DNN to perform better\ndereverberation. To identify the copies, we estimate the underlying filter (or\nRIR) by efficiently solving a linear regression problem per frequency in the\ntime-frequency domain. We then modify the proposed algorithm for speaker\nseparation in reverberant and noisy-reverberant conditions. State-of-the-art\nspeech dereverberation and speaker separation results are obtained on the\nREVERB, SMS-WSJ, and WHAMR! datasets.",

This is not a problem for most computing systems as there is an\nabundance of memory. However, embedded systems often have limited memory\nresources where heap allocation may cause memory fragmentation.

    "abstract": "Industrial cyber-physical systems require complex distributed software to\norchestrate many heterogeneous mechatronic components and control multiple\nphysical processes. Industrial automation software is typically developed in a\nmodel-driven fashion where abstractions of physical processes called plant\nmodels are co-developed and iteratively refined along with the control code.\nTesting such multi-dimensional systems is extremely difficult because often\nmodels might not be accurate, do not correspond accurately with subsequent\nrefinements, and the software must eventually be tested on the real plant,\nespecially in safety-critical systems like nuclear plants. This paper proposes\na framework wherein high-level functional requirements are used to\nautomatically generate test cases for designs at all abstraction levels in the\nmodel-driven engineering process. Requirements are initially specified in\nnatural language and then analyzed and specified using a formalized ontology.\nThe requirements ontology is then refined along with controller and plant\nmodels during design and development stages such that test cases can be\ngenerated automatically at any stage. A representative industrial water process\nsystem case study illustrates the strengths of the proposed formalism. The\nrequirements meta-model proposed by the CESAR European project is used for\nrequirements engineering while IEC 61131-3 and model-driven concepts are used\nin the design and development phases. A tool resulting from the proposed\nframework called REBATE (Requirements Based Automatic Testing Engine) is used\nto generate and execute test cases for increasingly concrete controller and\nplant models.",

    "abstract": "Crowdsourced testing, as a distinct testing paradigm, has attracted much\nattention in software testing, especially in mobile application (app) testing\nfield. Compared with in-house testing, crowdsourced testing outperforms because\nit utilize the diverse testing environments of different crowdworkers faced\nwith the mobile testing fragmentation problem. However, crowdsourced testing\nalso brings some problem. The crowdworkers involved are with different\nexpertise, and they are not professional testers. Therefore, the reports they\nmay submit are numerous and with uneven quality. App developers have to\ndistinguish high-quality reports from low-quality ones to help the bug\nrevealing and fixing. Some crowdworkers would submit inconsistent test reports,\nwhich means the textual descriptions are not focusing on the attached bug\noccurring screenshots. Such reports cause the waste on both time and human\nresources of app developing and testing.\nTo solve such a problem, we propose ReCoDe in this paper, which is designed\nto detect the consistency of crowdsourced test reports via deep image-and-text\nfusion understanding. First, according to a pre-conducted survey, ReCoDe\nclassifies the crowdsourced test reports into 10 categories, which covers the\nvast majority of reported problems in the test reports. Then, for each category\nof bugs, we have distinct processing models. The models have a deep fusion\nunderstanding on both image information and textual descriptions. We also have\nconducted an experiment to evaluate ReCoDe, and the results show the\neffectiveness of ReCoDe to detect consistency crowdsourced test reports.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we tackle the problem of dense light field (LF) reconstruction\nfrom sparsely-sampled ones with wide baselines and propose a learnable model,\nnamely dynamic interpolation, to replace the commonly-used geometry warping\noperation. Specifically, with the estimated geometric relation between input\nviews, we first construct a lightweight neural network to dynamically learn\nweights for interpolating neighbouring pixels from input views to synthesize\neach pixel of novel views independently. In contrast to the fixed and\ncontent-independent weights employed in the geometry warping operation, the\nlearned interpolation weights implicitly incorporate the correspondences\nbetween the source and novel views and adapt to different image content\ninformation. Then, we recover the spatial correlation between the independently\nsynthesized pixels of each novel view by referring to that of input views using\na geometry-based spatial refinement module. We also constrain the angular\ncorrelation between the novel views through a disparity-oriented LF structure\nloss. Experimental results on LF datasets with wide baselines show that the\nreconstructed LFs achieve much higher PSNR/SSIM and preserve the LF parallax\nstructure better than state-of-the-art methods.

Subspace Encoding Factorization Machine (SEFM) has been proposed\nrecently to overcome the expressiveness limitation of Factorization Machines\n(FM) by applying explicit nonlinear feature mapping for both individual\nfeatures and feature interactions through one-hot encoding to each input\nfeature. Despite the effectiveness of SEFM, it increases the memory cost of FM\nby $b$ times, where $b$ is the number of bins when applying one-hot encoding on\neach input feature. To reduce the memory cost of SEFM, we propose a new method\ncalled Binarized FM which constraints the model parameters to be binary values\n(i.e., 1 or $-1$). Then each parameter value can be efficiently stored in one\nbit. Our proposed method can significantly reduce the memory cost of SEFM\nmodel. In addition, we propose a new algorithm to effectively and efficiently\nlearn proposed FM with binary constraints using Straight Through Estimator\n(STE) with Adaptive Gradient Descent (Adagrad).

Two main challenges in VI-reID are\nintra-class variations across person images, and cross-modal discrepancies\nbetween visible and infrared images. Assuming that the person images are\nroughly aligned, previous approaches attempt to learn coarse image- or rigid\npart-level person representations that are discriminative and generalizable\nacross different modalities. However, the person images, typically cropped by\noff-the-shelf object detectors, are not necessarily well-aligned, which\ndistract discriminative person representation learning. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel feature learning framework that addresses these problems in a\nunified way. To this end, we propose to exploit dense correspondences between\ncross-modal person images. This allows to address the cross-modal discrepancies\nin a pixel-level, suppressing modality-related features from person\nrepresentations more effectively. This also encourages pixel-wise associations\nbetween cross-modal local features, further facilitating discriminative feature\nlearning for VI-reID.

We provide a\npolynomial time algorithm to exactly compute this optimal approximation which,\ntogether with the polynomial-time computable bottleneck distance among interval\ndecomposable modules, provides a lower bound on the interleaving distance.\nNext, we leverage this result to derive a polynomial-time computable distance\nfor general multi-parameter persistence modules which enjoys similar\nstability-like property.

In this work, the particle curved trajectory between two recordings\nis firstly explained with the streamline segment of a steady flow\n(diffeomorphic transformation) instead of a single vector, and this idea is\ntermed as diffeomorphic PIV. Specifically, a deformation field is introduced to\ndescribe the particle displacement, i.e., we try to find the optimal velocity\nfield, of which the corresponding deformation vector field agrees with the\nparticle displacement. Because the variation of the deformation function can be\napproximated with the variation of the velocity function, the diffeomorphic PIV\ncan be implemented as iterative PIV. That says, the diffeomorphic PIV warps the\nimages with deformation vector field instead of the velocity, and keeps the\nrest as same as iterative PIVs. Two diffeomorphic deformation schemes --\nforward diffeomorphic deformation interrogation (FDDI) and central\ndiffeomorphic deformation interrogation (CDDI) -- are proposed. Tested on\nsynthetic images, the FDDI achieves significant accuracy improvement across\ndifferent one-pass displacement estimators (cross-correlation, optical flow,\ndeep learning flow). Besides, the results on three real PIV image pairs\ndemonstrate the non-negligible curvature effect for CDI-based PIV, and our FDDI\nprovides larger velocity estimation (more accurate) in the fast curvy\nstreamline areas. The accuracy improvement of the combination of FDDI and\naccurate dense estimator means that our diffeomorphic PIV paves a new way for\ncomplex flow measurement.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies a novel encirclement guaranteed cooperative pursuit\nproblem involving $N$ pursuers and a single evader in an unbounded\ntwo-dimensional game domain. Throughout the game, the pursuers are required to\nmaintain encirclement of the evader, i.e., the evader should always stay inside\nthe convex hull generated by all the pursuers, in addition to achieving the\nclassical capture condition. To tackle this challenging cooperative pursuit\nproblem, a robust model predictive control (RMPC) based formulation framework\nis first introduced, which simultaneously accounts for the encirclement and\ncapture requirements under the assumption that the evader's action is\nunavailable to all pursuers. Despite the reformulation, the resulting RMPC\nproblem involves a bilinear constraint due to the encirclement requirement. To\nfurther handle such a bilinear constraint, a novel encirclement guaranteed\npartitioning scheme is devised that simplifies the original bilinear RMPC\nproblem to a number of linear tube MPC (TMPC) problems solvable in a\ndecentralized manner. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed solution framework. Furthermore, comparisons with existing\napproaches show that the explicit consideration of the encirclement condition\nsignificantly improves the chance of successful capture of the evader in\nvarious scenarios.",

On the one hand, although most cryptographic methods are provable\nsecure, they bring heavy computation and communication. On the other hand, the\nsecurity of many relatively efficient private methods (e.g., federated learning\nand split learning) is being questioned, since they are non-provable secure.\nInspired by previous work on privacy-preserving machine learning, we build a\nprivacy-preserving machine learning framework by combining random permutation\nand arithmetic secret sharing via our compute-after-permutation technique.\nSince our method reduces the cost for element-wise function computation, it is\nmore efficient than existing cryptographic methods. Moreover, by adopting\ndistance correlation as a metric for privacy leakage, we demonstrate that our\nmethod is more secure than previous non-provable secure methods. Overall, our\nproposal achieves a good balance between security and efficiency.

It is thus natural to apply a mono-color\ndual-camera system to restore color images with higher visual quality. In this\npaper, we propose a mono-color image enhancement algorithm that colorizes the\nmonochrome image with the color one. Based on the assumption that adjacent\nstructures with similar luminance values are likely to have similar colors, we\nfirst perform dense scribbling to assign colors to the monochrome pixels\nthrough block matching. Two types of outliers, including occlusion and color\nambiguity, are detected and removed from the initial scribbles. We also\nintroduce a sampling strategy to accelerate the scribbling process. Then, the\ndense scribbles are propagated to the entire image. To alleviate incorrect\ncolor propagation in the regions that have no color hints at all, we generate\nextra color seeds based on the existed scribbles to guide the propagation\nprocess. Experimental results show that, our algorithm can efficiently restore\ncolor images with higher SNR and richer details from the mono-color image\npairs, and achieves good performance in solving the color bleeding problem.",

Moreover, the meta-solver can be further fine-tuned and adaptive\nto a new game if iteration updates are allowed. We theoretically prove that our\nmeta-solver is not affected by the non-smoothness of exact Nash equilibrium\nsolutions, and derive a sample complexity bound to demonstrate its\ngeneralization ability across normal-form games.

    "abstract": "Instance segmentation in 3D scenes is fundamental in many applications of\nscene understanding. It is yet challenging due to the compound factors of data\nirregularity and uncertainty in the numbers of instances. State-of-the-art\nmethods largely rely on a general pipeline that first learns point-wise\nfeatures discriminative at semantic and instance levels, followed by a separate\nstep of point grouping for proposing object instances. While promising, they\nhave the shortcomings that (1) the second step is not supervised by the main\nobjective of instance segmentation, and (2) their point-wise feature learning\nand grouping are less effective to deal with data irregularities, possibly\nresulting in fragmented segmentations. To address these issues, we propose in\nthis work an end-to-end solution of Semantic Superpoint Tree Network (SSTNet)\nfor proposing object instances from scene points. Key in SSTNet is an\nintermediate, semantic superpoint tree (SST), which is constructed based on the\nlearned semantic features of superpoints, and which will be traversed and split\nat intermediate tree nodes for proposals of object instances. We also design in\nSSTNet a refinement module, termed CliqueNet, to prune superpoints that may be\nwrongly grouped into instance proposals.

The conventional feature\nimitation paradigm introduces imitation masks to focus on informative\nforeground areas while excluding the background noises. However, we find that\nthose methods fail to fully utilize the semantic information in all feature\npyramid levels, which leads to inefficiency for knowledge distillation between\nFPN-based detectors. To this end, we propose a novel semantic-guided feature\nimitation technique, which automatically performs soft matching between feature\npairs across all pyramid levels to provide the optimal guidance to the student.\nTo push the envelop even further, we introduce contrastive distillation to\neffectively capture the information encoded in the relationship between\ndifferent feature regions. Finally, we propose a generalized detection KD\npipeline, which is capable of distilling both homogeneous and heterogeneous\ndetector pairs.

To solve this issue, we propose\na novel category transfer framework for weakly supervised object detection.

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) show great advantages in solving\npartial differential equations. In this paper, we for the first time propose to\nstudy conformable time fractional diffusion equations by using PINNs. By\nsolving the supervise learning task, we design a new spatio-temporal function\napproximator with high data efficiency. L-BFGS algorithm is used to optimize\nour loss function, and back propagation algorithm is used to update our\nparameters to give our numerical solutions. For the forward problem, we can\ntake IC/BCs as the data, and use PINN to solve the corresponding partial\ndifferential equation. Three numerical examples are are carried out to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. In particular, when the order of\nthe conformable fractional derivative $\\alpha$ tends to $1$, a class of\nweighted PINNs is introduced to overcome the accuracy degradation caused by the\nsingularity of solutions. For the inverse problem, we use the data obtained to\ntrain the neural network, and the estimation of parameter $\\lambda$ in the\nequation is elaborated. Similarly, we give three numerical examples to show\nthat our method can accurately identify the parameters, even if the training\ndata is corrupted with 1\\% uncorrelated noise.",

We trained HPVD on\n771 DCE CT scans to detect HCCs and tested on external 164 positives and 206\ncontrols, respectively. We compare performance against six clinical readers,\nincluding two radiologists, two hepato-pancreatico-biliary (HPB) surgeons, and\ntwo hepatologists. The area under curve (AUC) of the localization receiver\noperating characteristic (LROC) for NC-only, NC plus VP, and full DCE CT\nyielded 0.71, 0.81, 0.89 respectively. At a high sensitivity operating point of\n80% on DCE CT, HPVD achieved 97% specificity, which is comparable to measured\nphysician performance.

Although Transformer-based models\nachieved state-of-the-art performance in the sequential recommendation task,\nthey generally require quadratic memory and time complexity to the sequence\nlength, making it difficult to extract the long-term interest of users. On the\nother hand, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)-based models, renowned for their\nlinear memory and time complexity, have recently shown competitive results\ncompared to Transformer in various tasks. Given the availability of a massive\namount of the user's behavior history, the linear memory and time complexity of\nMLP-based models make them a promising alternative to explore in the sequential\nrecommendation task. To this end, we adopted MLP-based models in sequential\nrecommendation but consistently observed that MLP-based methods obtain lower\nperformance than those of Transformer despite their computational benefits.\nFrom experiments, we observed that introducing explicit high-order interactions\nto MLP layers mitigates such performance gap. In response, we propose the\nMulti-Order Interaction (MOI) layer, which is capable of expressing an\narbitrary order of interactions within the inputs while maintaining the memory\nand time complexity of the MLP layer.

Both RBN and ASMS are systems in\nwhich a collection of anonymous, finite-state processes run the same protocol.\nIn RBN, the processes communicate by selective broadcast: a process can\nbroadcast a message which is received by all of its neighbors, and the set of\nneighbors of a process can change arbitrarily over time. In ASMS, the processes\ncommunicate by shared memory: a process can either write to or read from a\nshared register.

The\ncomplementary information from these two sensors makes the two-modality fusion\nbe a desired option. However, two major issues of the fusion between camera and\nLiDAR hinder its performance, \\ie, how to effectively fuse these two modalities\nand how to precisely align them (suffering from the weak spatiotemporal\nsynchronization problem). In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine LiDAR and\ncamera fusion-based network (termed as LIF-Seg) for LiDAR segmentation. For the\nfirst issue, unlike these previous works fusing the point cloud and image\ninformation in a one-to-one manner, the proposed method fully utilizes the\ncontextual information of images and introduces a simple but effective\nearly-fusion strategy. Second, due to the weak spatiotemporal synchronization\nproblem, an offset rectification approach is designed to align these\ntwo-modality features. The cooperation of these two components leads to the\nsuccess of the effective camera-LiDAR fusion. Experimental results on the\nnuScenes dataset show the superiority of the proposed LIF-Seg over existing\nmethods with a large margin.

To handle scenarios with scarce\nlabels, we further enable GCCAD as a self-supervised framework by designing a\ngraph corrupting strategy for generating synthetic node labels. To achieve the\ncontrastive objective, we design a graph neural network encoder that can infer\nand further remove suspicious links during message passing, as well as learn\nthe global context of the input graph. We conduct extensive experiments on four\npublic datasets, demonstrating that 1) GCCAD significantly and consistently\noutperforms various advanced baselines and 2) its self-supervised version\nwithout fine-tuning can achieve comparable performance with its fully\nsupervised version.",

    "abstract": "With the strength of deep generative models, 3D pose transfer regains\nintensive research interests in recent years. Existing methods mainly rely on a\nvariety of constraints to achieve the pose transfer over 3D meshes, e.g., the\nneed for the manually encoding for shape and pose disentanglement. In this\npaper, we present an unsupervised approach to conduct the pose transfer between\nany arbitrate given 3D meshes. Specifically, a novel Intrinsic-Extrinsic\nPreserved Generative Adversarial Network (IEP-GAN) is presented for both\nintrinsic (i.e., shape) and extrinsic (i.e., pose) information preservation.\nExtrinsically, we propose a co-occurrence discriminator to capture the\nstructural/pose invariance from distinct Laplacians of the mesh. Meanwhile,\nintrinsically, a local intrinsic-preserved loss is introduced to preserve the\ngeodesic priors while avoiding the heavy computations. At last, we show the\npossibility of using IEP-GAN to manipulate 3D human meshes in various ways,\nincluding pose transfer, identity swapping and pose interpolation with latent\ncode vector arithmetic. The extensive experiments on various 3D datasets of\nhumans, animals and hands qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the\ngenerality of our approach. Our proposed model produces better results and is\nsubstantially more efficient compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

One key challenge is that while many techniques\nhave been developed to facilitate the development of electrical DNN\naccelerators, techniques that support or expedite optical DNN accelerator\ndesign remain much less explored, limiting both the achievable performance and\nthe innovation development of optical DNN accelerators. To this end, we develop\nthe first-of-its-kind framework dubbed O-HAS, which for the first time\ndemonstrates automated Optical Hardware Accelerator Search for boosting both\nthe acceleration efficiency and development speed of optical DNN accelerators.\nSpecifically, our O-HAS consists of two integrated enablers: (1) an O-Cost\nPredictor, which can accurately yet efficiently predict an optical\naccelerator's energy and latency based on the DNN model parameters and the\noptical accelerator design; and (2) an O-Search Engine, which can automatically\nexplore the large design space of optical DNN accelerators and identify the\noptimal accelerators (i.e., the micro-architectures and\nalgorithm-to-accelerator mapping methods) in order to maximize the target\nacceleration efficiency.

    "abstract": "Bodlaender and Koster (Discrete Mathematics 2006) introduced the notion of\nalmost-clique separators in the context of computing the treewidth $\\tw(G)$ of\na given graph $G$. A separator $S \\subseteq V(G)$ of $G$ is an\n\\emph{almost-clique separator} if $S \\setminus \\{v\\}$ is a clique of $G$ for\nsome $v \\in S$. $S$ is a \\emph{minimal separator} if $S$ has at least two full\ncomponents, where a full component of $S$ is a connected component $C$ of $G\n\\setminus S$ such that $N_G(C) = S$. They observed that if $S$ is an\nalmost-clique minimal separator of $G$ then $\\tw(G \\cup K(S)) = \\tw(G)$, where\n$K(S)$ is the complete graph on vertex set $S$: in words, filling an\nalmost-clique minimal separator into a clique does not increase the treewidth.\nBased on this observation, they proposed a preprocessing method for treewidth\ncomputation, a fundamental step of which is to find a preferably maximal set of\npairwise non-crossing almost-clique minimal separators of a graph.\nIn this paper, we present a heuristic for this step, which is based on the\nfollowing empirical observation. For graph $G$ and a minimal triangulation $H$\nof $G$, let $\\QQ(H, G)$ denote the set of all almost-clique minimal separators\nof $G$ that are minimal separators of $H$. Note that since the minimal\nseparators of $H$ are pairwise non-crossing, so are those in $\\QQ(H, G)$. We\nobserve from experiments that $\\QQ(H, G)$ is remarkably close to maximal,\nespecially when the minimal triangulation $H$ is computed by an algorithm\naiming for small treewidth.\nThis observation leads to an efficient implementation of the preprocessing\nmethod proposed by Bodlaender and Koster.

    "abstract": "Fruit flies are established model systems for studying olfactory learning as\nthey will readily learn to associate odors with both electric shock or sugar\nrewards. The mechanisms of the insect brain apparently responsible for odor\nlearning form a relatively shallow neuronal architecture. Olfactory inputs are\nreceived by the antennal lobe (AL) of the brain, which produces an encoding of\neach odor mixture across ~50 sub-units known as glomeruli. Each of these\nglomeruli then project its component of this feature vector to several of ~2000\nso-called Kenyon Cells (KCs) in a region of the brain known as the mushroom\nbody (MB). Fly responses to odors are generated by small downstream neuropils\nthat decode the higher-order representation from the MB. Research has shown\nthat there is no recognizable pattern in the glomeruli--KC connections (and\nthus the particular higher-order representations); they are akin to\nfingerprints~-- even isogenic flies have different projections. Leveraging\ninsights from this architecture, we propose KCNet, a single-hidden-layer neural\nnetwork that contains sparse, randomized, binary weights between the input\nlayer and the hidden layer and analytically learned weights between the hidden\nlayer and the output layer. Furthermore, we also propose a dynamic optimization\nalgorithm that enables the KCNet to increase performance beyond its structural\nlimits by searching a more efficient set of inputs. For odorant-perception\ntasks that predict perceptual properties of an odorant, we show that KCNet\noutperforms existing data-driven approaches, such as XGBoost. For\nimage-classification tasks, KCNet achieves reasonable performance on benchmark\ndatasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and EMNIST) without any data-augmentation\nmethods or convolutional layers and shows particularly fast running time.

Prior studies mainly resorted to the semantic matching between\ntextual queries and user/product related documents, leaving the user\ncollaborative behaviors untapped. In fact, the collaborative filtering signals\nbetween users intuitively offer a complementary information for the semantic\nmatching. To close the gap between collaborative filtering and product search,\nwe propose a Hierarchical Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HHGNN) approach\nin this paper. Specifically, we organize HHGNN with a hierarchical graph\nstructure according to the three edge types. The sequence edge accounts for the\nsyntax formulation from word nodes to sentence nodes; the composition edge\naggregates the semantic features to the user and product nodes; and the\ninteraction edge on the top performs graph convolutional operation between user\nand product nodes. At last, we integrate the higher-order neighboring\ncollaborative features and the semantic features for better representation\nlearning. We conduct extensive experiments on six Amazon review datasets. The\nresults show that our proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art\nbaselines with a large margin.

    "abstract": "We start by discussing the link between ecosystem simulators and general AI.\nThen we present the open-source ecosystem simulator Ecotwin, which is based on\nthe game engine Unity and operates on ecosystems containing inanimate objects\nlike mountains and lakes, as well as organisms such as animals and plants.\nAnimal cognition is modeled by integrating three separate networks: (i) a\n\\textit{reflex network} for hard-wired reflexes; (ii) a \\textit{happiness\nnetwork} that maps sensory data such as oxygen, water, energy, and smells, to a\nscalar happiness value; and (iii) a \\textit{policy network} for selecting\nactions. The policy network is trained with reinforcement learning (RL), where\nthe reward signal is defined as the happiness difference from one time step to\nthe next. All organisms are capable of either sexual or asexual reproduction,\nand they die if they run out of critical resources. We report results from\nthree studies with Ecotwin, in which natural phenomena emerge in the models\nwithout being hardwired. First, we study a terrestrial ecosystem with wolves,\ndeer, and grass, in which a Lotka-Volterra style population dynamics emerges.\nSecond, we study a marine ecosystem with phytoplankton, copepods, and krill, in\nwhich a diel vertical migration behavior emerges. Third, we study an ecosystem\ninvolving lethal dangers, in which certain agents that combine RL with reflexes\noutperform pure RL agents.",

    "title": "Channel Estimation for Extremely Large-Scale MIMO: Far-Field or  Near-Field?",
    "abstract": "Extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) with hybrid\nprecoding is a promising technique to meet the high data rate requirements for\nfuture 6G communications. To realize efficient hybrid precoding, it is\nessential to obtain accurate channel state information. Existing channel\nestimation algorithms with low pilot overhead heavily rely on the channel\nsparsity in the angle domain, which is achieved by the classical far-field\nplanar wavefront assumption. However, due to the non-negligible near-field\nspherical wavefront property in XL-MIMO systems, this channel sparsity in the\nangle domain is not available anymore, and thus existing far-field channel\nestimation schemes will suffer from severe performance loss. To address this\nproblem, in this paper we study the near-field channel estimation by exploiting\nthe polar-domain sparse representation of the near-field XL-MIMO channel.\nSpecifically, unlike the classical angle-domain representation that only\nconsiders the angle information of the channel, we propose a new polar-domain\nrepresentation, which simultaneously accounts for both the angle and distance\ninformation. In this way, the near-field channel also exhibits sparsity in the\npolar domain. By exploiting the channel sparsity in the polar domain, we\npropose the on-grid and off-grid near-field channel estimation schemes for\nXL-MIMO. Firstly, an on-grid polar-domain simultaneous orthogonal matching\npursuit (P-SOMP) algorithm is proposed to efficiently estimate the near-field\nchannel. Furthermore, to solve the resolution limitation of the on-grid P-SOMP\nalgorithm, an off-grid polar-domain simultaneous iterative gridless weighted\n(P-SIGW) algorithm is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy, where the\nparameters of the near-field channel are directly estimated. Finally, numerical\nresults are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.",

    "abstract": "Automated animal censuses with aerial imagery are a vital ingredient towards\nwildlife conservation. Recent models are generally based on deep learning and\nthus require vast amounts of training data. Due to their scarcity and minuscule\nsize, annotating animals in aerial imagery is a highly tedious process. In this\nproject, we present a methodology to reduce the amount of required training\ndata by resorting to self-supervised pretraining. In detail, we examine a\ncombination of recent contrastive learning methodologies like Momentum Contrast\n(MoCo) and Cross-Level Instance-Group Discrimination (CLD) to condition our\nmodel on the aerial images without the requirement for labels. We show that a\ncombination of MoCo, CLD, and geometric augmentations outperforms conventional\nmodels pre-trained on ImageNet by a large margin. Crucially, our method still\nyields favorable results even if we reduce the number of training animals to\njust 10%, at which point our best model scores double the recall of the\nbaseline at similar precision. This effectively allows reducing the number of\nrequired annotations to a fraction while still being able to train\nhigh-accuracy models in such highly challenging settings.",

    "abstract": "Using finite-state machines to learn patterns, Tsetlin machines (TMs) have\nobtained competitive accuracy and learning speed across several benchmarks,\nwith frugal memory- and energy footprint. A TM represents patterns as\nconjunctive clauses in propositional logic (AND-rules), each clause voting for\nor against a particular output. While efficient for single-output problems, one\nneeds a separate TM per output for multi-output problems. Employing multiple\nTMs hinders pattern reuse because each TM then operates in a silo. In this\npaper, we introduce clause sharing, merging multiple TMs into a single one.\nEach clause is related to each output by using a weight. A positive weight\nmakes the clause vote for output $1$, while a negative weight makes the clause\nvote for output $0$. The clauses thus coalesce to produce multiple outputs. The\nresulting coalesced Tsetlin Machine (CoTM) simultaneously learns both the\nweights and the composition of each clause by employing interacting Stochastic\nSearching on the Line (SSL) and Tsetlin Automata (TA) teams. Our empirical\nresults on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Kuzushiji-MNIST show that CoTM obtains\nsignificantly higher accuracy than TM on $50$- to $1$K-clause configurations,\nindicating an ability to repurpose clauses. E.g., accuracy goes from $71.99$%\nto $89.66$% on Fashion-MNIST when employing $50$ clauses per class (22 Kb\nmemory). While TM and CoTM accuracy is similar when using more than $1$K\nclauses per class, CoTM reaches peak accuracy $3\\times$ faster on MNIST with\n$8$K clauses. We further investigate robustness towards imbalanced training\ndata. Our evaluations on imbalanced versions of IMDb- and CIFAR10 data show\nthat CoTM is robust towards high degrees of class imbalance. Being able to\nshare clauses, we believe CoTM will enable new TM application domains that\ninvolve multiple outputs, such as learning language models and auto-encoding.",

    "abstract": "We propose a direct domain adaptation (DDA) approach to enrich the training\nof supervised neural networks on synthetic data by features from real-world\ndata. The process involves a series of linear operations on the input features\nto the NN model, whether they are from the source or target domains, as\nfollows: 1) A cross-correlation of the input data (i.e. images) with a randomly\npicked sample pixel (or pixels) of all images from that domain or the mean of\nall randomly picked sample pixel (or pixels) of all images. 2) The convolution\nof the resulting data with the mean of the autocorrelated input images from the\nother domain. In the training stage, as expected, the input images are from the\nsource domain, and the mean of auto-correlated images are evaluated from the\ntarget domain. In the inference/application stage, the input images are from\nthe target domain, and the mean of auto-correlated images are evaluated from\nthe source domain. The proposed method only manipulates the data from the\nsource and target domains and does not explicitly interfere with the training\nworkflow and network architecture. An application that includes training a\nconvolutional neural network on the MNIST dataset and testing the network on\nthe MNIST-M dataset achieves a 70% accuracy on the test data. A principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA), as well as t-SNE, show that the input features from\nthe source and target domains, after the proposed direct transformations, share\nsimilar properties along with the principal components as compared to the\noriginal MNIST and MNIST-M input features.",

    "abstract": "Visual surface anomaly detection aims to detect local image regions that\nsignificantly deviate from normal appearance. Recent surface anomaly detection\nmethods rely on generative models to accurately reconstruct the normal areas\nand to fail on anomalies. These methods are trained only on anomaly-free\nimages, and often require hand-crafted post-processing steps to localize the\nanomalies, which prohibits optimizing the feature extraction for maximal\ndetection capability. In addition to reconstructive approach, we cast surface\nanomaly detection primarily as a discriminative problem and propose a\ndiscriminatively trained reconstruction anomaly embedding model (DRAEM). The\nproposed method learns a joint representation of an anomalous image and its\nanomaly-free reconstruction, while simultaneously learning a decision boundary\nbetween normal and anomalous examples. The method enables direct anomaly\nlocalization without the need for additional complicated post-processing of the\nnetwork output and can be trained using simple and general anomaly simulations.\nOn the challenging MVTec anomaly detection dataset, DRAEM outperforms the\ncurrent state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a large margin and even\ndelivers detection performance close to the fully-supervised methods on the\nwidely used DAGM surface-defect detection dataset, while substantially\noutperforming them in localization accuracy.",

Based on the estimated channel, we apply the\nlow-complexity maximal ratio combining (MRC) beamforming at the BS, and then\nderive the ergodic achievable rate in a closed form expression.\nTo draw design insights, we perform a detailed theoretical analysis departing\nfrom the derived ergodic achievable rate. If the BS-RIS channel is Rician\ndistributed, we prove that the transmit power can be scaled proportionally to\n$1/M$, as the number of BS antennas, $M$, grows to infinity while maintaining a\nnon-zero rate.\nIf the BS-RIS channel is Rayleigh distributed, the transmit power can be\nscaled either proportionally to $1/\\sqrt{M}$ as $M$ grows large, or\nproportionally to $1/N$ as the number of reflecting elements, $N$, grows large,\nwhile still maintaining a non-zero rate.\nBy capitalizing on the derived expression of the data rate under the\nstatistical knowledge of the CSI, we maximize the minimum user rate by\ndesigning the passive beamforming at the RIS.\nNumerical results confirm that, even in the presence of imperfect CSI, the\nintegration of an RIS in massive MIMO systems results in promising performance\ngains.

    "title": "Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation for All Day Images using  Domain Separation",
    "abstract": "Remarkable results have been achieved by DCNN based self-supervised depth\nestimation approaches. However, most of these approaches can only handle either\nday-time or night-time images, while their performance degrades for all-day\nimages due to large domain shift and the variation of illumination between day\nand night images. To relieve these limitations, we propose a domain-separated\nnetwork for self-supervised depth estimation of all-day images. Specifically,\nto relieve the negative influence of disturbing terms (illumination, etc.), we\npartition the information of day and night image pairs into two complementary\nsub-spaces: private and invariant domains, where the former contains the unique\ninformation (illumination, etc.) of day and night images and the latter\ncontains essential shared information (texture, etc.). Meanwhile, to guarantee\nthat the day and night images contain the same information, the\ndomain-separated network takes the day-time images and corresponding night-time\nimages (generated by GAN) as input, and the private and invariant feature\nextractors are learned by orthogonality and similarity loss, where the domain\ngap can be alleviated, thus better depth maps can be expected. Meanwhile, the\nreconstruction and photometric losses are utilized to estimate complementary\ninformation and depth maps effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour approach achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation results for all-day\nimages on the challenging Oxford RobotCar dataset, proving the superiority of\nour proposed approach.",

Frequentist learning, however, is known to be problematic in the regime\nof limited data as it fails to quantify epistemic uncertainty in prediction.\nBayesian learning provides a principled solution to this problem by shifting\nthe optimization domain to the space of distribution in the model parameters.\nThis paper studies for the first time Bayesian FL in wireless systems by\nproposing and analyzing a gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method\n-- Wireless Federated Langevin Monte Carlo (WFLMC). The key idea of this work\nis to repurpose channel noise for the double role of seed randomness for MCMC\nsampling and of privacy-preserving mechanism. To this end, based on the\nanalysis of the Wasserstein distance between sample distribution and global\nposterior distribution under privacy and power constraints, we introduce a\npower allocation strategy as the solution of a convex program. The analysis\nidentifies distinct operating regimes in which the performance of the system is\npower-limited, privacy-limited, or limited by the requirement of MCMC sampling.\nBoth analytical and simulation results demonstrate that, if the channel noise\nis properly accounted for under suitable conditions, it can be fully repurposed\nfor both MCMC sampling and privacy preservation, obtaining the same performance\nas in an ideal communication setting that is not subject to privacy\nconstraints.",

To date, it has not been validated if\nsocial media sentiment can measure the day to day temporal dynamics of emotions\naggregated at the macro level of a whole online community.

For both platforms, we find strong correlations between\ntext analysis results and levels of self-reported emotions, as well as between\ninter-day changes of both measurements. We further show that a combination of\nsupervised and unsupervised text analysis methods is the most accurate approach\nto measure emotion aggregates. We illustrate the application of such social\nmedia macroscopes when studying the association between the number of new\nCOVID-19 cases and emotions, showing that the strength of associations is\ncomparable when using survey data as when using social media data.

Given the varying standards for code comments, and their\nunstructured or semi-structured nature, developers get easily confused\n(especially novice developers) about which convention(s) to follow, or what\ntools to use while writing code documentation. Thus, they post related\nquestions on external online sources to seek better commenting practices. In\nthis paper, we analyze code comment discussions on online sources such as Stack\nOverflow (SO) and Quora to shed some light on the questions developers ask\nabout commenting practices. We apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to\nidentify emerging topics concerning code comments. Then we manually analyze a\nstatistically significant sample set of posts to derive a taxonomy that\nprovides an overview of the developer questions about commenting practices. Our\nresults highlight that on SO nearly 40% of the questions mention how to write\nor process comments in documentation tools and environments, and nearly 20% of\nthe questions are about potential limitations and possibilities of\ndocumentation tools to add automatically and consistently more information in\ncomments. On the other hand, on Quora, developer questions focus more on\nbackground information (35% of the questions) or asking opinions (16% of the\nquestions) about code comments. We found that (i) not all aspects of comments\nare covered in coding style guidelines, e.g., how to add a specific type of\ninformation, (ii) developers need support in learning the syntax and format\nconventions to add various types of information in comments, and (iii)\ndevelopers are interested in various automated strategies for comments such as\ndetection of bad comments, or verify comment style automatically, but lack tool\nsupport to do that.",

    "abstract": "With the renaissance of deep learning, automatic diagnostic systems for\ncomputed tomography (CT) have achieved many successful applications. However,\nthey are mostly attributed to careful expert annotations, which are often\nscarce in practice. This drives our interest to the unsupervised representation\nlearning. Recent studies have shown that self-supervised learning is an\neffective approach for learning representations, but most of them rely on the\nempirical design of transformations and pretext tasks. To avoid the\nsubjectivity associated with these methods, we propose the MVCNet, a novel\nunsupervised three dimensional (3D) representation learning method working in a\ntransformation-free manner. We view each 3D lesion from different orientations\nto collect multiple two dimensional (2D) views. Then, an embedding function is\nlearned by minimizing a contrastive loss so that the 2D views of the same 3D\nlesion are aggregated, and the 2D views of different lesions are separated. We\nevaluate the representations by training a simple classification head upon the\nembedding layer. Experimental results show that MVCNet achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracies on the LIDC-IDRI (89.55%), LNDb (77.69%) and\nTianChi (79.96%) datasets for unsupervised representation learning. When\nfine-tuned on 10% of the labeled data, the accuracies are comparable to the\nsupervised learning model (89.46% vs. 85.03%, 73.85% vs. 73.44%, 83.56% vs.\n83.34% on the three datasets, respectively), indicating the superiority of\nMVCNet in learning representations with limited annotations.

Interestingly, for a\nfew fundamental two-party functions such as inner product and Hamming distance,\nthe accuracy of the distributed solution lags way behind what is achievable in\nthe client-server setting. McGregor, Mironov, Pitassi, Reingold, Talwar, and\nVadhan [FOCS '10] proved that this gap is inherent, showing upper bounds on the\naccuracy of (any) distributed solution for these functions.

Our bound implies a combinatorial proof for the fact\nthat non-Boolean inner product of independent (strong) Santha-Vazirani sources\nis a good condenser.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised disentanglement learning is a crucial issue for understanding\nand exploiting deep generative models. Recently, SeFa tries to find latent\ndisentangled directions by performing SVD on the first projection of a\npre-trained GAN. However, it is only applied to the first layer and works in a\npost-processing way. Hessian Penalty minimizes the off-diagonal entries of the\noutput's Hessian matrix to facilitate disentanglement, and can be applied to\nmulti-layers.However, it constrains each entry of output independently, making\nit not sufficient in disentangling the latent directions (e.g., shape, size,\nrotation, etc.) of spatially correlated variations. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple Orthogonal Jacobian Regularization (OroJaR) to encourage deep generative\nmodel to learn disentangled representations. It simply encourages the variation\nof output caused by perturbations on different latent dimensions to be\northogonal, and the Jacobian with respect to the input is calculated to\nrepresent this variation. We show that our OroJaR also encourages the output's\nHessian matrix to be diagonal in an indirect manner. In contrast to the Hessian\nPenalty, our OroJaR constrains the output in a holistic way, making it very\neffective in disentangling latent dimensions corresponding to spatially\ncorrelated variations. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show\nthat our method is effective in disentangled and controllable image generation,\nand performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "One of the biggest challenges that complicates applied supervised machine\nlearning is the need for huge amounts of labeled data. Active Learning (AL) is\na well-known standard method for efficiently obtaining labeled data by first\nlabeling the samples that contain the most information based on a query\nstrategy. Although many methods for query strategies have been proposed in the\npast, no clear superior method that works well in general for all domains has\nbeen found yet. Additionally, many strategies are computationally expensive\nwhich further hinders the widespread use of AL for large-scale annotation\nprojects.\nWe, therefore, propose ImitAL, a novel query strategy, which encodes AL as a\nlearning-to-rank problem. For training the underlying neural network we chose\nImitation Learning. The required demonstrative expert experience for training\nis generated from purely synthetic data.\nTo show the general and superior applicability of \\ImitAL{}, we perform an\nextensive evaluation comparing our strategy on 15 different datasets, from a\nwide range of domains, with 10 different state-of-the-art query strategies. We\nalso show that our approach is more runtime performant than most other\nstrategies, especially on very large datasets.",

    "abstract": "Sprouts is a two-player pencil-and-paper game invented by John Conway and\nMichael Paterson in 1967. In the game, the players take turns in joining dots\nby curves according to simple rules, until one player cannot make a move. The\ngame of Sprouts is very popular and simple-looking, so it may come as a\nsurprise that there are essentially no AI Sprouts players available. This lack\nof computer opponents is caused by the fact that the game hides a surprisingly\nhigh combinatorial complexity and implementing it involves fascinating\nprogramming challenges.\nWe overcome all the implementation barriers and create the first\nuser-friendly Sprouts application with a strong artificial intelligence after\nmore than 50 years of the existence of the game. In particular, we combine\nresults from the theory of nimbers with new methods based on Delaunay\ntriangulations and crossing-preserving force-directed algorithms to develop an\nAI Sprouts player which plays a perfect game on up to 11 spots.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a conceptually simple, strong, and efficient\nframework for fully- and weakly-supervised panoptic segmentation, called\nPanoptic FCN. Our approach aims to represent and predict foreground things and\nbackground stuff in a unified fully convolutional pipeline, which can be\noptimized with point-based fully or weak supervision. In particular, Panoptic\nFCN encodes each object instance or stuff category with the proposed kernel\ngenerator and produces the prediction by convolving the high-resolution feature\ndirectly. With this approach, instance-aware and semantically consistent\nproperties for things and stuff can be respectively satisfied in a simple\ngenerate-kernel-then-segment workflow. Without extra boxes for localization or\ninstance separation, the proposed approach outperforms the previous box-based\nand -free models with high efficiency. Furthermore, we propose a new form of\npoint-based annotation for weakly-supervised panoptic segmentation. It only\nneeds several random points for both things and stuff, which dramatically\nreduces the annotation cost of human. The proposed Panoptic FCN is also proved\nto have much superior performance in this weakly-supervised setting, which\nachieves 82% of the fully-supervised performance with only 20 randomly\nannotated points per instance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of Panoptic FCN on COCO, VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and\nMapillary Vistas datasets. And it sets up a new leading benchmark for both\nfully- and weakly-supervised panoptic segmentation.

    "abstract": "Running faster will only get you so far -- it is generally advisable to first\nunderstand where the roads lead, then get a car ...\nThe renaissance of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) over the last\ndecade is accompanied by an unscalable computational cost, limiting its\nadvancement and weighing on the field in practice. In this thesis we take a\nsystematic approach to address the algorithmic and methodological limitations\nat the root of these costs. We first demonstrate that DL training and pruning\nare predictable and governed by scaling laws -- for state of the art models and\ntasks, spanning image classification and language modeling, as well as for\nstate of the art model compression via iterative pruning. Predictability, via\nthe establishment of these scaling laws, provides the path for principled\ndesign and trade-off reasoning, currently largely lacking in the field. We then\ncontinue to analyze the sources of the scaling laws, offering an\napproximation-theoretic view and showing through the exploration of a noiseless\nrealizable case that DL is in fact dominated by error sources very far from the\nlower error limit. We conclude by building on the gained theoretical\nunderstanding of the scaling laws' origins. We present a conjectural path to\neliminate one of the current dominant error sources -- through a data bandwidth\nlimiting hypothesis and the introduction of Nyquist learners -- which can, in\nprinciple, reach the generalization error lower limit (e.g. 0 in the noiseless\ncase), at finite dataset size.",

This chapter looks at the role that workers\nplay in identifying and mitigating harms from AI technologies. Harms are the\ncausally assessed impacts of technologies. They arise despite technical\nreliability and are not a result of technical negligence but rather of\nnormative uncertainty around questions of safety and fairness in complex social\nsystems. There is high consensus in the AI ethics community on the benefits of\nreducing harms but less consensus on mechanisms for determining or addressing\nharms.

The harm reporting process involves\nthree steps, identification, the governance decision, and the response. Workers\ndraw upon three types of claims to argue for jurisdiction over questions of AI\ngovernance, subjection, control over the product of labor, and proximate\nknowledge of systems. Examining the past decade of AI related worker activism\nallows us to understand how different types of workers are positioned within a\nworkplace that produces AI systems, how their position informs their claims,\nand the place of collective action in staking their claims.

    "abstract": "Introduction: When a learner fails to reach a milestone, educators often\nwonder if there had been any warning signs that could have allowed them to\nintervene sooner. Machine learning is used to predict which students are at\nrisk of failing a national certifying exam. Predictions are made well in\nadvance of the exam, such that educators can meaningfully intervene before\nstudents take the exam.\nMethods: Using already-collected, first-year student assessment data from\nfour cohorts in a Master of Physician Assistant Studies program, the authors\nimplement an \"adaptive minimum match\" version of the k-nearest neighbors\nalgorithm (AMMKNN), using changing numbers of neighbors to predict each\nstudent's future exam scores on the Physician Assistant National Certifying\nExamination (PANCE). Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was used to\nevaluate the practical capabilities of this model, before making predictions\nfor new students.\nResults: The best predictive model has an accuracy of 93%, sensitivity of\n69%, and specificity of 94%. It generates a predicted PANCE score for each\nstudent, one year before they are scheduled to take the exam. Students can then\nbe prospectively categorized into groups that need extra support, optional\nextra support, or no extra support. The educator then has one year to provide\nthe appropriate customized support to each type of student.\nConclusions: Predictive analytics can help health professions educators\nallocate scarce time and resources across their students. Interprofessional\neducators can use the included methods and code to generate predicted test\noutcomes for students. The authors recommend that educators using this or\nsimilar predictive methods act responsibly and transparently.",

Due to the increase in the rate of poor graduates, it is necessary to\ndesign a system that helps to reduce this menace as well as reduce the\nincidence of students having to repeat due to poor performance or having to\ndrop out of school altogether in the middle of the pursuit of their career. It\nis therefore necessary to study each one as well as their advantages and\ndisadvantages, so as to determine which is more efficient in and in what case\none should be preferred over the other. The study aims to develop a system to\npredict student performance with Artificial Neutral Network using the student\ndemographic traits so as to assist the university in selecting candidates\n(students) with a high prediction of success for admission using previous\nacademic records of students granted admissions which will eventually lead to\nquality graduates of the institution. The model was developed based on certain\nselected variables as the input. It achieved an accuracy of over 92.3 percent,\nshowing Artificial Neural Network potential effectiveness as a predictive tool\nand a selection criterion for candidates seeking admission to a university.",

    "abstract": "We studied variability in General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) awareness\nin relation to digital experience in the 28 European countries of EU27-UK,\nthrough secondary analysis of the Eurobarometer 91.2 survey conducted in March\n2019 (N = 27,524). Education, occupation, and age were the strongest\nsociodemographic predictors of GDPR awareness, with little influence of gender,\nsubjective economic well-being, or locality size. Digital experience was\nsignificantly and positively correlated with GDPR awareness in a linear model,\nbut this relationship proved to be more complex when we examined it through a\ntypological analysis. Using an exploratory k-means cluster analysis we\nidentified four clusters of digital citizenship, across both dimensions of\ndigital experience and GDPR awareness: the off-line citizens (22%), the social\nnetizens (32%), the web citizens (17%), and the data citizens (29%). The\noff-line citizens ranked lowest in internet use and GDPR awareness; the web\ncitizens ranked at about average values, while the data citizens ranked highest\nin both digital experience and GDPR knowledge and use. The fourth identified\ncluster, the social netizens, had a discordant profile, with remarkably high\nsocial network use, below average online shopping experiences, and low GDPR\nawareness. Digitalization in human capital and general internet use is a strong\ncountry-level correlate of the national frequency of the data citizen type. Our\nresults confirm previous studies of the low privacy awareness and skills\nassociated with intense social media consumption, but we found that young\ngenerations are evenly divided between the rather carefree social netizens and\nthe strongly invested data citizens.",

    "abstract": "CONTRIBUTION: This paper presents an empirical study of an introductory-level\nprogramming course with students using multiple monitors and compares their\nperformance and self-reported experiences versus students using a single\nmonitor. BACKGROUND: Professional-level programming in many technological\nfields often employs multiple-monitors stations, however, some education\nlaboratories employ single-monitor stations. This is unrepresentative of what\nstudents will encounter in practice and experiential learning. RESEARCH\nQUESTIONS: This study aims to answer three research questions. The questions\ninclude discovering the experiential observations of the students, contrasting\nthe performance of the students using one monitor versus those using two\nmonitors, and an investigation of the ways in which multiple monitors were\nemployed by the students. METHODOLOGY: Half of the students in the study had\naccess to multiple monitors. This was the only difference between the two study\ngroups. This study contrasts grade medians and conducts median-test evaluation.\nAdditionally, an experience survey facilitated likert-scale values and\nopen-ended feedback questions facilitated textual analysis. Limitations of the\nstudy include the small sample size (86 students) and lack of control of\nparticipant composition. FINDINGS: Students reacted very favorably in rating\ntheir experience using the intervention. Overall, the multiple-monitor group\nhad a slight performance improvement. Most improvement was in software-design\nand graphics assignments. Performance increased statistically significantly on\nthe interfaces-and-hierarchies labs. Students used multiple-monitors in\ndifferent ways including reference guides, assignment specifications, and more.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the limits of the current generation of large language\nmodels for program synthesis in general purpose programming languages. We\nevaluate a collection of such models (with between 244M and 137B parameters) on\ntwo new benchmarks, MBPP and MathQA-Python, in both the few-shot and\nfine-tuning regimes. Our benchmarks are designed to measure the ability of\nthese models to synthesize short Python programs from natural language\ndescriptions. The Mostly Basic Programming Problems (MBPP) dataset contains 974\nprogramming tasks, designed to be solvable by entry-level programmers. The\nMathQA-Python dataset, a Python version of the MathQA benchmark, contains 23914\nproblems that evaluate the ability of the models to synthesize code from more\ncomplex text. On both datasets, we find that synthesis performance scales\nlog-linearly with model size. Our largest models, even without finetuning on a\ncode dataset, can synthesize solutions to 59.6 percent of the problems from\nMBPP using few-shot learning with a well-designed prompt. Fine-tuning on a\nheld-out portion of the dataset improves performance by about 10 percentage\npoints across most model sizes. On the MathQA-Python dataset, the largest\nfine-tuned model achieves 83.8 percent accuracy. Going further, we study the\nmodel's ability to engage in dialog about code, incorporating human feedback to\nimprove its solutions. We find that natural language feedback from a human\nhalves the error rate compared to the model's initial prediction. Additionally,\nwe conduct an error analysis to shed light on where these models fall short and\nwhat types of programs are most difficult to generate. Finally, we explore the\nsemantic grounding of these models by fine-tuning them to predict the results\nof program execution. We find that even our best models are generally unable to\npredict the output of a program given a specific input.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a system for incrementally reconstructing a dense\n3D model of the geometry of an outdoor environment using a single monocular\ncamera attached to a moving vehicle. Dense models provide a rich representation\nof the environment facilitating higher-level scene understanding, perception,\nand planning. Our system employs dense depth prediction with a hybrid mapping\narchitecture combining state-of-the-art sparse features and dense fusion-based\nvisual SLAM algorithms within an integrated framework. Our novel contributions\ninclude design of hybrid sparse-dense camera tracking and loop closure, and\nscale estimation improvements in dense depth prediction. We use the motion\nestimates from the sparse method to overcome the large and variable inter-frame\ndisplacement typical of outdoor vehicle scenarios. Our system then registers\nthe live image with the dense model using whole-image alignment. This enables\nthe fusion of the live frame and dense depth prediction into the model. Global\nconsistency and alignment between the sparse and dense models are achieved by\napplying pose constraints from the sparse method directly within the\ndeformation of the dense model. We provide qualitative and quantitative results\nfor both trajectory estimation and surface reconstruction accuracy,\ndemonstrating competitive performance on the KITTI dataset.

    "abstract": "In streaming data applications incoming samples are processed and discarded,\ntherefore, intelligent decision-making is crucial for the performance of\nlifelong learning systems. In addition, the order in which samples arrive may\nheavily affect the performance of online (and offline) incremental learners.\nThe recently introduced incremental cluster validity indices (iCVIs) provide\nvaluable aid in addressing such class of problems. Their primary use-case has\nbeen cluster quality monitoring; nonetheless, they have been very recently\nintegrated in a streaming clustering method to assist the clustering task\nitself. In this context, the work presented here introduces the first adaptive\nresonance theory (ART)-based model that uses iCVIs for unsupervised and\nsemi-supervised online learning. Moreover, it shows for the first time how to\nuse iCVIs to regulate ART vigilance via an iCVI-based match tracking mechanism.\nThe model achieves improved accuracy and robustness to ordering effects by\nintegrating an online iCVI framework as module B of a topological adaptive\nresonance theory predictive mapping (TopoARTMAP) -- thereby being named\niCVI-TopoARTMAP -- and by employing iCVI-driven post-processing heuristics at\nthe end of each learning step. The online iCVI framework provides assignments\nof input samples to clusters at each iteration in accordance to any of several\niCVIs. The iCVI-TopoARTMAP maintains useful properties shared by ARTMAP models,\nsuch as stability, immunity to catastrophic forgetting, and the many-to-one\nmapping capability via the map field module. The performance (unsupervised and\nsemi-supervised) and robustness to presentation order (unsupervised) of\niCVI-TopoARTMAP were evaluated via experiments with a synthetic data set and\ndeep embeddings of a real-world face image data set.",

In this work, we propose a Task-aligned\nOne-stage Object Detection (TOOD) that explicitly aligns the two tasks in a\nlearning-based manner. First, we design a novel Task-aligned Head (T-Head)\nwhich offers a better balance between learning task-interactive and\ntask-specific features, as well as a greater flexibility to learn the alignment\nvia a task-aligned predictor. Second, we propose Task Alignment Learning (TAL)\nto explicitly pull closer (or even unify) the optimal anchors for the two tasks\nduring training via a designed sample assignment scheme and a task-aligned\nloss. Extensive experiments are conducted on MS-COCO, where TOOD achieves a\n51.1 AP at single-model single-scale testing. This surpasses the recent\none-stage detectors by a large margin, such as ATSS (47.7 AP), GFL (48.2 AP),\nand PAA (49.0 AP), with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

Using\northogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) in the uplink, each\ndevice will need to apply a different frequency adjustment value to compensate\nfor the Doppler shift. To this end, the 3GPP Release-17 work on NTNs assumes\nthat an NTN device is equipped with a global navigation satellite system (GNSS)\nchipset and thereby can determine its position and calculate the needed\nfrequency adjustment value using its position information and satellite\nephemeris data. This makes GNSS support essential for the NTN operation.\nHowever, GNSS signals are weak, not ubiquitous, and susceptible to interference\nand spoofing. We show that devices without access to GNSS signals can utilize\nreference signals in more than one frequency position in an OFDM carrier to\nestimate the Doppler shift and thereby determine the needed frequency\nadjustment value for pre-compensating the Doppler shift in the uplink. We\nanalyze the performance, elaborate on how to utilize the NR reference signals,\nand present simulation results.

Modeling the uncertainty as probabilistic confidence scores\nresults in a probabilistic knowledge graph. Graph queries over such\nprobabilistic KGs require answer computation along with the computation of\nthose result probabilities, aka, probabilistic inference. We propose a system,\nHAPPI (How Provenance of Probabilistic Inference), to handle such query\nprocessing. Complying with the standard provenance semiring model, we propose a\nnovel commutative semiring to symbolically compute the probability of the\nresult of a query. These provenance-polynomiallike symbolic expressions encode\nfine-grained information about the probability computation process. We leverage\nthis encoding to efficiently compute as well as maintain the probability of\nresults as the underlying KG changes. Focusing on a popular class of\nconjunctive basic graph pattern queries on the KG, we compare the performance\nof HAPPI against a possible-world model of computation and a knowledge\ncompilation tool over two large datasets. We also propose an adaptive system\nthat leverages the strengths of both HAPPI and compilation based techniques.\nSince existing systems for probabilistic databases mostly focus on query\ncomputation, they default to re-computation when facts in the KG are updated.\nHAPPI, on the other hand, does not just perform probabilistic inference and\nmaintain their provenance, but also provides a mechanism to incrementally\nmaintain them as the KG changes.

The proposed RL framework can be refined and applied\nto cities across the world to optimize charging station placement.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses domain adaptation for the pixel-wise classification of\nremotely sensed data using deep neural networks (DNN) as a strategy to reduce\nthe requirements of DNN with respect to the availability of training data. We\nfocus on the setting in which labelled data are only available in a source\ndomain DS, but not in a target domain DT. Our method is based on adversarial\ntraining of an appearance adaptation network (AAN) that transforms images from\nDS such that they look like images from DT. Together with the original label\nmaps from DS, the transformed images are used to adapt a DNN to DT. We propose\na joint training strategy of the AAN and the classifier, which constrains the\nAAN to transform the images such that they are correctly classified. In this\nway, objects of a certain class are changed such that they resemble objects of\nthe same class in DT. To further improve the adaptation performance, we propose\na new regularization loss for the discriminator network used in domain\nadversarial training. We also address the problem of finding the optimal values\nof the trained network parameters, proposing an unsupervised entropy based\nparameter selection criterion which compensates for the fact that there is no\nvalidation set in DT that could be monitored. As a minor contribution, we\npresent a new weighting strategy for the cross-entropy loss, addressing the\nproblem of imbalanced class distributions. Our method is evaluated in 42\nadaptation scenarios using datasets from 7 cities, all consisting of\nhigh-resolution digital orthophotos and height data. It achieves a positive\ntransfer in all cases, and on average it improves the performance in the target\ndomain by 4.3% in overall accuracy.

In\npractice, through stacking a newly proposed event counter on the top of a\ntransformer decoder, the PDVC precisely segments the video into a number of\nevent pieces under the holistic understanding of the video content, which\neffectively increases the coherence and readability of predicted captions.\nCompared with prior arts, the PDVC has several appealing advantages: (1)\nWithout relying on heuristic non-maximum suppression or a recurrent event\nsequence selection network to remove redundancy, PDVC directly produces an\nevent set with an appropriate size; (2) In contrast to adopting the two-stage\nscheme, we feed the enhanced representations of event queries into the\nlocalization head and caption head in parallel, making these two sub-tasks\ndeeply interrelated and mutually promoted through the optimization; (3) Without\nbells and whistles, extensive experiments on ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2\nshow that PDVC is capable of producing high-quality captioning results,\nsurpassing the state-of-the-art two-stage methods when its localization\naccuracy is on par with them.

A promising solution to\nthis problem is to make better use of the synthetic dataset, which consists of\nCAD object models, to boost the learning on real datasets. This can be achieved\nby the pre-training and fine-tuning procedure. However, recent work on 3D\npre-training exhibits failure when transfer features learned on synthetic\nobjects to other real-world applications. In this work, we put forward a new\nmethod called RandomRooms to accomplish this objective.

The model pre-trained in this way can serve as a\nbetter initialization when later fine-tuning on the 3D object detection task.\nEmpirically, we show consistent improvement in downstream 3D detection tasks on\nseveral base models, especially when less training data are used, which\nstrongly demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of our method.\nBenefiting from the rich semantic knowledge and diverse objects from synthetic\ndata, our method establishes the new state-of-the-art on widely-used 3D\ndetection benchmarks ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D.

In this paper, we show that the\nrelations among videos can provide important clues for more accurate action\nquality assessment during both training and inference. Specifically, we\nreformulate the problem of action quality assessment as regressing the relative\nscores with reference to another video that has shared attributes (e.g.,\ncategory and difficulty), instead of learning unreferenced scores. Following\nthis formulation, we propose a new Contrastive Regression (CoRe) framework to\nlearn the relative scores by pair-wise comparison, which highlights the\ndifferences between videos and guides the models to learn the key hints for\nassessment. In order to further exploit the relative information between two\nvideos, we devise a group-aware regression tree to convert the conventional\nscore regression into two easier sub-problems: coarse-to-fine classification\nand regression in small intervals. To demonstrate the effectiveness of CoRe, we\nconduct extensive experiments on three mainstream AQA datasets including AQA-7,\nMTL-AQA and JIGSAWS.

    "abstract": "Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is a general multiple access scheme for\ndownlink multi-antenna systems embracing both classical spatial division\nmultiple access and more recent non-orthogonal multiple access. Finding a\nlinear precoding strategy that maximizes the sum spectral efficiency of RSMA is\na challenging yet significant problem. In this paper, we put forth a novel\nprecoder design framework that jointly finds the linear precoders for the\ncommon and private messages for RSMA. Our approach is first to approximate the\nnon-smooth minimum function part in the sum spectral efficiency of RSMA using a\nLogSumExp technique. Then, we reformulate the sum spectral efficiency\nmaximization problem as a form of the log-sum of Rayleigh quotients to convert\nit into a tractable non-convex optimization problem. By interpreting the\nfirst-order optimality condition of the reformulated problem as an\neigenvector-dependent nonlinear eigenvalue problem, we reveal that a leading\neigenvector is a local optimal solution. To find the leading eigenvector, we\npropose a computationally efficient algorithm inspired by a power iteration\nmethod. Simulation results show that the proposed RSMA transmission strategy\nprovides significant improvement in the sum spectral efficiency compared to the\nstate-of-the-art RSMA transmission methods, while requiring considerably less\ncomputational complexity.",

The classifier and autoencoder work together to\nmonitor a spectrum area to identify the common waveforms inside the area of\noperation along with detecting unknown waveforms.

The discretized macroscopic\nMaxwell equations possess Hamiltonian structure; the use of mimetic spaces and\nand a natural discretization of the variational derivatives ensure the\nexistence of discrete Casimir invariants of the Maxwell bracket.

In this work we consider the\nproblem of exhaustively generating all $\\boldsymbol{a}$-multiset permutations\nby star transpositions, i.e., in each step, the first entry of the string is\ntransposed with any other entry distinct from the first one. This is a\nfar-ranging generalization of several known results.

In recent years,\nParallel Imaging (PI) and Compressed Sensing (CS) have been utilised to\naccelerate the MRI acquisition. In clinical settings, subsampling the k-space\nmeasurements during scanning time using Cartesian trajectories, such as\nrectilinear sampling, is currently the most conventional CS approach applied\nwhich, however, is prone to producing aliased reconstructions. With the advent\nof the involvement of Deep Learning (DL) in accelerating the MRI,\nreconstructing faithful images from subsampled data became increasingly\npromising. Retrospectively applying a subsampling mask onto the k-space data is\na way of simulating the accelerated acquisition of k-space data in real\nclinical setting. In this paper we compare and provide a review for the effect\nof applying either rectilinear or radial retrospective subsampling on the\nquality of the reconstructions outputted by trained deep neural networks. With\nthe same choice of hyper-parameters, we train and evaluate two distinct\nRecurrent Inference Machines (RIMs), one for each type of subsampling. The\nqualitative and quantitative results of our experiments indicate that the model\ntrained on data with radial subsampling attains higher performance and learns\nto estimate reconstructions with higher fidelity paving the way for other DL\napproaches to involve radial subsampling.",

    "title": "SURFNet: Super-resolution of Turbulent Flows with Transfer Learning  using Small Datasets",
    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are emerging as a key alternative to\ncomputationally expensive CFD simulations. However, state-of-the-art DL\napproaches require large and high-resolution training data to learn accurate\nmodels. The size and availability of such datasets are a major limitation for\nthe development of next-generation data-driven surrogate models for turbulent\nflows. This paper introduces SURFNet, a transfer learning-based\nsuper-resolution flow network. SURFNet primarily trains the DL model on\nlow-resolution datasets and transfer learns the model on a handful of\nhigh-resolution flow problems - accelerating the traditional numerical solver\nindependent of the input size. We propose two approaches to transfer learning\nfor the task of super-resolution, namely one-shot and incremental learning.\nBoth approaches entail transfer learning on only one geometry to account for\nfine-grid flow fields requiring 15x less training data on high-resolution\ninputs compared to the tiny resolution (64x256) of the coarse model,\nsignificantly reducing the time for both data collection and training. We\nempirically evaluate SURFNet's performance by solving the Navier-Stokes\nequations in the turbulent regime on input resolutions up to 256x larger than\nthe coarse model. On four test geometries and eight flow configurations unseen\nduring training, we observe a consistent 2-2.1x speedup over the OpenFOAM\nphysics solver independent of the test geometry and the resolution size (up to\n2048x2048), demonstrating both resolution-invariance and generalization\ncapabilities. Our approach addresses the challenge of reconstructing\nhigh-resolution solutions from coarse grid models trained using low-resolution\ninputs (super-resolution) without loss of accuracy and requiring limited\ncomputational resources.",

    "abstract": "Parking demand forecasting and behaviour analysis have received increasing\nattention in recent years because of their critical role in mitigating traffic\ncongestion and understanding travel behaviours. However, previous studies\nusually only consider temporal dependence but ignore the spatial correlations\namong parking lots for parking prediction. This is mainly due to the lack of\ndirect physical connections or observable interactions between them. Thus, how\nto quantify the spatial correlation remains a significant challenge. To bridge\nthe gap, in this study, we propose a spatial-aware parking prediction\nframework, which includes two steps, i.e. spatial connection graph construction\nand spatio-temporal forecasting. A case study in Ningbo, China is conducted\nusing parking data of over one million records before and during COVID-19. The\nresults show that the approach is superior on parking occupancy forecasting\nthan baseline methods, especially for the cases with high temporal irregularity\nsuch as during COVID-19. Our work has revealed the impact of the pandemic on\nparking behaviour and also accentuated the importance of modelling spatial\ndependence in parking behaviour forecasting, which can benefit future studies\non epidemiology and human travel behaviours.",

    "abstract": "The study of 3D hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction refers to the\ninverse process of snapshot compressive imaging, during which the optical\nsystem, e.g., the coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) system,\ncaptures the 3D spatial-spectral signal and encodes it to a 2D measurement.\nWhile numerous sophisticated neural networks have been elaborated for\nend-to-end reconstruction, trade-offs still need to be made among performance,\nefficiency (training and inference time), and feasibility (the ability of\nrestoring high resolution HSI on limited GPU memory). This raises a challenge\nto design a new baseline to conjointly meet the above requirements. In this\npaper, we fill in this blank by proposing a Spatial/Spectral Invariant Residual\nU-Net, namely SSI-ResU-Net. It differentiates with U-Net in three folds--1)\nscale/spectral-invariant learning, 2) nested residual learning, and 3)\ncomputational efficiency. Benefiting from these three modules, the proposed\nSSI-ResU-Net outperforms the current state-of-the-art method TSA-Net by over 3\ndB in PSNR and 0.036 in SSIM while only using 2.82% trainable parameters. To\nthe greatest extent, SSI-ResU-Net achieves competing performance with over\n77.3% reduction in terms of floating-point operations (FLOPs), which for the\nfirst time, makes high-resolution HSI reconstruction feasible under practical\napplication scenarios.

Measuring SMBH mass is important for understanding the\norigin and evolution of SMBHs. However, traditional methods require\nspectroscopic data which is expensive to gather. We present an algorithm that\nweighs SMBHs using quasar light time series, circumventing the need for\nexpensive spectra. We train, validate, and test neural networks that directly\nlearn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 light curves for a\nsample of $38,939$ spectroscopically confirmed quasars to map out the nonlinear\nencoding between SMBH mass and multi-color optical light curves. We find a\n1$\\sigma$ scatter of 0.37 dex between the predicted SMBH mass and the fiducial\nvirial mass estimate based on SDSS single-epoch spectra, which is comparable to\nthe systematic uncertainty in the virial mass estimate.
