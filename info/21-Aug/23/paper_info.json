    "abstract": "Automated next-best action recommendation for each customer in a sequential,\ndynamic and interactive context has been widely needed in natural, social and\nbusiness decision-making. Personalized next-best action recommendation must\ninvolve past, current and future customer demographics and circumstances\n(states) and behaviors, long-range sequential interactions between customers\nand decision-makers, multi-sequence interactions between states, behaviors and\nactions, and their reactions to their counterpart's actions. No existing\nmodeling theories and tools, including Markovian decision processes, user and\nbehavior modeling, deep sequential modeling, and personalized sequential\nrecommendation, can quantify such complex decision-making on a personal level.\nWe take a data-driven approach to learn the next-best actions for personalized\ndecision-making by a reinforced coupled recurrent neural network (CRN). CRN\nrepresents multiple coupled dynamic sequences of a customer's historical and\ncurrent states, responses to decision-makers' actions, decision rewards to\nactions, and learns long-term multi-sequence interactions between parties\n(customer and decision-maker). Next-best actions are then recommended on each\ncustomer at a time point to change their state for an optimal decision-making\nobjective. Our study demonstrates the potential of personalized deep learning\nof multi-sequence interactions and automated dynamic intervention for\npersonalized decision-making in complex systems.",

Scaling up T5 from millions to billions of parameters is found to produce\nconsistent improvements on downstream tasks.

We show how electromagnetic emanation can be used to\nmanipulate the image information captured by a CCD image sensor with the\ngranularity down to the brightness of individual pixels.

However, manual analysis\nof such video is tedious, error-prone, unreliable, and prohibitively\ntime-consuming if one wishes to analyze a significant fraction of frames for\neven videos of modest length. In this work, we developed an automated TEM video\nanalysis system for microstructural features based on the advanced object\ndetection model called YOLO and tested the system on an in-situ ion irradiation\nTEM video of dislocation loops formed in a FeCrAl alloy. The system provides\nanalysis of features observed in TEM including both static and dynamic\nproperties using the YOLO-based defect detection module coupled to a geometry\nanalysis module and a dynamic tracking module. Results show that the system can\nachieve human comparable performance with an F1 score of 0.89 for fast,\nconsistent, and scalable frame-level defect analysis. This result is obtained\non a real but exceptionally clean and stable data set and more challenging data\nsets may not achieve this performance. The dynamic tracking also enabled\nevaluation of individual defect evolution like per defect growth rate at a\nfidelity never before achieved using common human analysis methods.

    "abstract": "The predict-then-optimize framework is fundamental in practical stochastic\ndecision-making problems: first predict unknown parameters of an optimization\nmodel, then solve the problem using the predicted values. A natural loss\nfunction in this setting is defined by measuring the decision error induced by\nthe predicted parameters, which was named the Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO)\nloss by Elmachtoub and Grigas [arXiv:1710.08005]. Since the SPO loss is\ntypically nonconvex and possibly discontinuous, Elmachtoub and Grigas\n[arXiv:1710.08005] introduced a convex surrogate, called the SPO+ loss, that\nimportantly accounts for the underlying structure of the optimization model. In\nthis paper, we greatly expand upon the consistency results for the SPO+ loss\nprovided by Elmachtoub and Grigas [arXiv:1710.08005]. We develop risk bounds\nand uniform calibration results for the SPO+ loss relative to the SPO loss,\nwhich provide a quantitative way to transfer the excess surrogate risk to\nexcess true risk. By combining our risk bounds with generalization bounds, we\nshow that the empirical minimizer of the SPO+ loss achieves low excess true\nrisk with high probability. We first demonstrate these results in the case when\nthe feasible region of the underlying optimization problem is a polyhedron, and\nthen we show that the results can be strengthened substantially when the\nfeasible region is a level set of a strongly convex function. We perform\nexperiments to empirically demonstrate the strength of the SPO+ surrogate, as\ncompared to standard $\\ell_1$ and squared $\\ell_2$ prediction error losses, on\nportfolio allocation and cost-sensitive multi-class classification problems.",

    "abstract": "In-memory computing (IMC) on a monolithic chip for deep learning faces\ndramatic challenges on area, yield, and on-chip interconnection cost due to the\never-increasing model sizes. 2.5D integration or chiplet-based architectures\ninterconnect multiple small chips (i.e., chiplets) to form a large computing\nsystem, presenting a feasible solution beyond a monolithic IMC architecture to\naccelerate large deep learning models. This paper presents a new benchmarking\nsimulator, SIAM, to evaluate the performance of chiplet-based IMC architectures\nand explore the potential of such a paradigm shift in IMC architecture design.\nSIAM integrates device, circuit, architecture, network-on-chip (NoC),\nnetwork-on-package (NoP), and DRAM access models to realize an end-to-end\nsystem. SIAM is scalable in its support of a wide range of deep neural networks\n(DNNs), customizable to various network structures and configurations, and\ncapable of efficient design space exploration. We demonstrate the flexibility,\nscalability, and simulation speed of SIAM by benchmarking different\nstate-of-the-art DNNs with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets. We\nfurther calibrate the simulation results with a published silicon result,\nSIMBA. The chiplet-based IMC architecture obtained through SIAM shows\n130$\\times$ and 72$\\times$ improvement in energy-efficiency for ResNet-50 on\nthe ImageNet dataset compared to Nvidia V100 and T4 GPUs.",

Data Quality refers to the relevance\nof the information present and helps in various operations like decision making\nand planning in a particular organization.

The current empirical study was undertaken to formulate a concrete\nautomated data quality platform to assess the quality of incoming dataset and\ngenerate a quality label, score and comprehensive report.

The results of the current\nempirical study revealed a metric that encompasses nine quality ingredients,\nnamely provenance, dataset characteristics, uniformity, metadata coupling,\npercentage of missing cells and duplicate rows, skewness of data, the ratio of\ninconsistencies of categorical columns, and correlation between these\nattributes. The study also provides an illustrative case study and validation\nof the metric following Mutation Testing approaches.

    "abstract": "Social media such as Instagram and Twitter have become important platforms\nfor marketing and selling illicit drugs. Detection of online illicit drug\ntrafficking has become critical to combat the online trade of illicit drugs.\nHowever, the legal status often varies spatially and temporally; even for the\nsame drug, federal and state legislation can have different regulations about\nits legality. Meanwhile, more drug trafficking events are disguised as a novel\nform of advertising commenting leading to information heterogeneity.\nAccordingly, accurate detection of illicit drug trafficking events (IDTEs) from\nsocial media has become even more challenging. In this work, we conduct the\nfirst systematic study on fine-grained detection of IDTEs on Instagram. We\npropose to take a deep multimodal multilabel learning (DMML) approach to detect\nIDTEs and demonstrate its effectiveness on a newly constructed dataset called\nmultimodal IDTE(MM-IDTE). Specifically, our model takes text and image data as\nthe input and combines multimodal information to predict multiple labels of\nillicit drugs. Inspired by the success of BERT, we have developed a\nself-supervised multimodal bidirectional transformer by jointly fine-tuning\npretrained text and image encoders. We have constructed a large-scale dataset\nMM-IDTE with manually annotated multiple drug labels to support fine-grained\ndetection of illicit drugs. Extensive experimental results on the MM-IDTE\ndataset show that the proposed DMML methodology can accurately detect IDTEs\neven in the presence of special characters and style changes attempting to\nevade detection.",

So far, the focus has been shape reconstruction,\nwhile shape generalization was mostly left to generic encoder-decoder or\nauto-decoder regularization.\nIn this paper we advocate deformation-aware regularization for implicit\nneural representations, aiming at producing plausible deformations as latent\ncode changes. The challenge is that implicit representations do not capture\ncorrespondences between different shapes, which makes it difficult to represent\nand regularize their deformations. Thus, we propose to pair the implicit\nrepresentation of the shapes with an explicit, piecewise linear deformation\nfield, learned as an auxiliary function.

Various\nmethods have been explored for wildfire risk prediction. However, the complex\ncorrelations among a lot of natural and human factors and wildfire ignition\nmake the prediction task very challenging.

Our main\ncontribution is the first distributed connectivity-preserving transformation\nthat exploits line moves within a total of $O(n \\log_2 n)$ moves, which is\nasymptotically equivalent to that of the best-known centralised\ntransformations. The algorithm solves the \\emph{line formation problem} that\nallows agents to form a final straight line $S_L$, starting from any shape $\nS_I $, whose \\emph{associated graph} contains a Hamiltonian path.",

In\nthis paper, we propose a new task called CIGLI: Conditional Image Generation\nfrom Language and Image. Instead of generating an image based on text as in\ntext-image generation, this task requires the generation of an image from a\ntextual description and an image prompt. We designed a new dataset to ensure\nthat the text description describes information from both images, and that\nsolely analyzing the description is insufficient to generate an image. We then\npropose a novel language-image fusion model which improves the performance over\ntwo established baseline methods, as evaluated by quantitative (automatic) and\nqualitative (human) evaluations.

We evaluate the proposed CloudShield on representative\ncloud benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that CloudShield, using model\npretraining, can apply to a wide scope of cloud workloads. Especially, we\nobserve that CloudShield can detect the recently proposed speculative execution\nattacks, e.g., Spectre and Meltdown attacks, in milliseconds.

    "abstract": "There has been a remarkable progress in learning a model which could\nrecognise novel classes with only a few labeled examples in the last few years.\nFew-shot learning (FSL) for action recognition is a challenging task of\nrecognising novel action categories which are represented by few instances in\nthe training data. We propose a novel variational inference based architectural\nframework (HF-AR) for few shot activity recognition. Our framework leverages\nvolume-preserving Householder Flow to learn a flexible posterior distribution\nof the novel classes. This results in better performance as compared to\nstate-of-the-art few shot approaches for human activity recognition. approach\nconsists of base model and an adapter model. Our architecture consists of a\nbase model and an adapter model. The base model is trained on seen classes and\nit computes an embedding that represent the spatial and temporal insights\nextracted from the input video, e.g. combination of Resnet-152 and LSTM based\nencoder-decoder model. The adapter model applies a series of Householder\ntransformations to compute a flexible posterior distribution that lends higher\naccuracy in the few shot approach. Extensive experiments on three well-known\ndatasets: UCF101, HMDB51 and Something-Something-V2, demonstrate similar or\nbetter performance on 1-shot and 5-shot classification as compared to\nstate-of-the-art few shot approaches that use only RGB frame sequence as input.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore variational inference\nalong with householder transformations to capture the full rank covariance\nmatrix of posterior distribution, for few shot learning in activity\nrecognition.",

    "abstract": "Domain generalization approaches aim to learn a domain invariant prediction\nmodel for unknown target domains from multiple training source domains with\ndifferent distributions. Significant efforts have recently been committed to\nbroad domain generalization, which is a challenging and topical problem in\nmachine learning and computer vision communities. Most previous domain\ngeneralization approaches assume that the conditional distribution across the\ndomains remain the same across the source domains and learn a domain invariant\nmodel by minimizing the marginal distributions. However, the assumption of a\nstable conditional distribution of the training source domains does not really\nhold in practice. The hyperplane learned from the source domains will easily\nmisclassify samples scattered at the boundary of clusters or far from their\ncorresponding class centres. To address the above two drawbacks, we propose a\ndiscriminative domain-invariant adversarial network (DDIAN) for domain\ngeneralization. The discriminativeness of the features are guaranteed through a\ndiscriminative feature module and domain-invariant features are guaranteed\nthrough the global domain and local sub-domain alignment modules. Extensive\nexperiments on several benchmarks show that DDIAN achieves better prediction on\nunseen target data during training compared to state-of-the-art domain\ngeneralization approaches.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly activities such as robbery, explosion, accidents, etc. need immediate\nactions for preventing loss of human life and property in real world\nsurveillance systems. Although the recent automation in surveillance systems\nare capable of detecting the anomalies, but they still need human efforts for\ncategorizing the anomalies and taking necessary preventive actions. This is due\nto the lack of methodology performing both anomaly detection and classification\nfor real world scenarios. Thinking of a fully automatized surveillance system,\nwhich is capable of both detecting and classifying the anomalies that need\nimmediate actions, a joint anomaly detection and classification method is a\npressing need. The task of joint detection and classification of anomalies\nbecomes challenging due to the unavailability of dense annotated videos\npertaining to anomalous classes, which is a crucial factor for training modern\ndeep architecture. Furthermore, doing it through manual human effort seems\nimpossible. Thus, we propose a method that jointly handles the anomaly\ndetection and classification in a single framework by adopting a\nweakly-supervised learning paradigm. In weakly-supervised learning instead of\ndense temporal annotations, only video-level labels are sufficient for\nlearning. The proposed model is validated on a large-scale publicly available\nUCF-Crime dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.",

A challenge of training such a model lies in\nproperly infusing class information into its generator and discriminator. For\nthe discriminator, class conditioning can be achieved by either (1) directly\nincorporating labels as input or (2) involving labels in an auxiliary\nclassification loss. In this paper, we show that the former directly aligns the\nclass-conditioned fake-and-real data distributions\n$P(\\text{image}|\\text{class})$ ({\\em data matching}), while the latter aligns\ndata-conditioned class distributions $P(\\text{class}|\\text{image})$ ({\\em label\nmatching}). Although class separability does not directly translate to sample\nquality and becomes a burden if classification itself is intrinsically\ndifficult, the discriminator cannot provide useful guidance for the generator\nif features of distinct classes are mapped to the same point and thus become\ninseparable. Motivated by this intuition, we propose a Dual Projection GAN\n(P2GAN) model that learns to balance between {\\em data matching} and {\\em label\nmatching}.

    "abstract": "Most deep models for underwater image enhancement resort to training on\nsynthetic datasets based on underwater image formation models. Although\npromising performances have been achieved, they are still limited by two\nproblems: (1) existing underwater image synthesis models have an intrinsic\nlimitation, in which the homogeneous ambient light is usually randomly\ngenerated and many important dependencies are ignored, and thus the synthesized\ntraining data cannot adequately express characteristics of real underwater\nenvironments; (2) most of deep models disregard lots of favorable underwater\npriors and heavily rely on training data, which extensively limits their\napplication ranges. To address these limitations, a new underwater synthetic\ndataset is first established, in which a revised ambient light synthesis\nequation is embedded. The revised equation explicitly defines the complex\nmathematical relationship among intensity values of the ambient light in RGB\nchannels and many dependencies such as surface-object depth, water types, etc,\nwhich helps to better simulate real underwater scene appearances. Secondly, a\nunified framework is proposed, named ANA-SYN, which can effectively enhance\nunderwater images under collaborations of priors (underwater domain knowledge)\nand data information (underwater distortion distribution). The proposed\nframework includes an analysis network and a synthesis network, one for priors\nexploration and another for priors integration. To exploit more accurate\npriors, the significance of each prior for the input image is explored in the\nanalysis network and an adaptive weighting module is designed to dynamically\nrecalibrate them. Meanwhile, a novel prior guidance module is introduced in the\nsynthesis network, which effectively aggregates the prior and data features and\nthus provides better hybrid information to perform the more reasonable image\nenhancement.",

To\naddress the computational efficiency issue and the false negative noise issue\ninvolved in the pixel contrastive loss, we further introduce and investigate\nseveral negative sampling techniques.

Spatial and\ntemporal distractors in person videos, such as background clutter and partial\nocclusions over frames, respectively, make this task much more challenging than\nimage-based person reID. We observe that spatial distractors appear\nconsistently in a particular location, and temporal distractors show several\npatterns, e.g., partial occlusions occur in the first few frames, where such\npatterns provide informative cues for predicting which frames to focus on\n(i.e., temporal attentions). Based on this, we introduce a novel Spatial and\nTemporal Memory Networks (STMN). The spatial memory stores features for spatial\ndistractors that frequently emerge across video frames, while the temporal\nmemory saves attentions which are optimized for typical temporal patterns in\nperson videos. We leverage the spatial and temporal memories to refine\nframe-level person representations and to aggregate the refined frame-level\nfeatures into a sequence-level person representation, respectively, effectively\nhandling spatial and temporal distractors in person videos.

    "abstract": "Measuring and evaluating network resilience has become an important aspect\nsince the network is vulnerable to both uncertain disturbances and malicious\nattacks. Networked systems are often composed of many dynamic components and\nchange over time, which makes it difficult for existing methods to access the\nchangeable situation of network resilience. This paper establishes a novel\nquantitative framework for evaluating network resilience using the Dynamic\nBayesian Network. The proposed framework can be used to evaluate the network's\nmulti-stage resilience processes when suffering various attacks and recoveries.\nFirst, we define the dynamic capacities of network components and establish the\nnetwork's five core resilience capabilities to describe the resilient\nnetworking stages including preparation, resistance, adaptation, recovery, and\nevolution; the five core resilience capabilities consist of rapid response\ncapability, sustained resistance capability, continuous running capability,\nrapid convergence capability, and dynamic evolution capability. Then, we employ\na two-time slices approach based on the Dynamic Bayesian Network to quantify\nfive crucial performances of network resilience based on core capabilities\nproposed above. The proposed approach can ensure the time continuity of\nresilience evaluation in time-varying networks. Finally, our proposed\nevaluation framework is applied to different attacks and recovery conditions in\ntypical simulations and real-world network topology. Results and comparisons\nwith extant studies indicate that the proposed method can achieve a more\naccurate and comprehensive evaluation and can be applied to network scenarios\nunder various attack and recovery intensities.",

    "title": "Out-of-boundary View Synthesis Towards Full-Frame Video Stabilization",
    "abstract": "Warping-based video stabilizers smooth camera trajectory by constraining each\npixel's displacement and warp stabilized frames from unstable ones accordingly.\nHowever, since the view outside the boundary is not available during warping,\nthe resulting holes around the boundary of the stabilized frame must be\ndiscarded (i.e., cropping) to maintain visual consistency, and thus does leads\nto a tradeoff between stability and cropping ratio. In this paper, we make a\nfirst attempt to address this issue by proposing a new Out-of-boundary View\nSynthesis (OVS) method. By the nature of spatial coherence between adjacent\nframes and within each frame, OVS extrapolates the out-of-boundary view by\naligning adjacent frames to each reference one. Technically, it first\ncalculates the optical flow and propagates it to the outer boundary region\naccording to the affinity, and then warps pixels accordingly. OVS can be\nintegrated into existing warping-based stabilizers as a plug-and-play module to\nsignificantly improve the cropping ratio of the stabilized results. In\naddition, stability is improved because the jitter amplification effect caused\nby cropping and resizing is reduced. Experimental results on the NUS benchmark\nshow that OVS can improve the performance of five representative\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of objective metrics and subjective visual\nquality.

    "abstract": "The movement of humans and goods in cities can be represented by constrained\nflow, which is defined as the movement of objects between origin and\ndestination in road networks. Flow aggregation, namely origins and destinations\naggregated simultaneously, is one of the most common patterns, say the\naggregated origin-to-destination flows between two transport hubs may indicate\nthe great traffic demand between two sites. Developing a clustering method for\nconstrained flows is crucial for determining urban flow aggregation. Among\nexisting methods about identifying flow aggregation, L-function of flows is the\nmajor one. Nevertheless, this method depends on the aggregation scale, the key\nparameter detected by Euclidean L-function, it does not adapt to road network.\nThe extracted aggregation may be overestimated and dispersed. Therefore, we\npropose a clustering method based on L-function of Manhattan space, which\nconsists of three major steps. The first is to detect aggregation scales by\nManhattan L-function. The second is to determine core flows possessing highest\nlocal L-function values at different scales. The final step is to take the\nintersection of core flows neighbourhoods, the extent of which depends on\ncorresponding scale. By setting the number of core flows, we could concentrate\nthe aggregation and thus highlight Aggregation Artery Architecture (AAA), which\ndepicts road sections that contain the projection of key flow cluster on the\nroad networks. Experiment using taxi flows showed that AAA could clarify\nresident movement type of identified aggregated flows. Our method also helps\nselecting locations for distribution sites, thereby supporting accurate\nanalysis of urban interactions.",

There are many reports in the\nliterature showing the potential for FPGAs to accelerate a wide variety of\nalgorithms, which combined with their growing availability, would seem to also\nindicate a widespread use in many applications. Unfortunately, there is not\nmuch published research exploring what it takes to integrate an FPGA into an\nexisting application in a cost-effective way and keeping the algorithmic\nperformance advantages. Building on recent results exploring how to employ\nFPGAs to improve the search engines used in the travel industry, this paper\nanalyses the end-to-end performance of the search engine when using FPGAs, as\nwell as the necessary changes to the software and the cost of such deployments.\nThe results provide important insights on current FPGA deployments and what\nneeds to be done to make FPGAs more widely used. For instance, the large\npotential performance gains provided by an FPGA are greatly diminished in\npractice if the application cannot submit request in the most optimal way,\nsomething that is not always possible and might require significant changes to\nthe application. Similarly, some existing cloud deployments turn out to use a\nvery imbalanced architecture: a powerful FPGA connected to a not so powerful\nCPU. The result is that the CPU cannot generate enough load for the FPGA, which\npotentially eliminates all performance gains and might even result in a more\nexpensive system. In this paper, we report on an extensive study and\ndevelopment effort to incorporate FPGAs into a search engine and analyse the\nissues encountered and their practical impact. We expect that these results\nwill inform the development and deployment of FPGAs in the future by providing\nimportant insights on the end-to-end integration of FPGAs within existing\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "Real-world recommendation systems often consist of two phases. In the first\nphase, multiple predictive models produce the probability of different\nimmediate user actions. In the second phase, these predictions are aggregated\naccording to a set of 'strategic parameters' to meet a diverse set of business\ngoals, such as longer user engagement, higher revenue potential, or more\ncommunity/network interactions. In addition to building accurate predictive\nmodels, it is also crucial to optimize this set of 'strategic parameters' so\nthat primary goals are optimized while secondary guardrails are not hurt. In\nthis setting with multiple and constrained goals, this paper discovers that a\nprobabilistic strategic parameter regime can achieve better value compared to\nthe standard regime of finding a single deterministic parameter. The new\nprobabilistic regime is to learn the best distribution over strategic parameter\nchoices and sample one strategic parameter from the distribution when each user\nvisits the platform. To pursue the optimal probabilistic solution, we formulate\nthe problem into a stochastic compositional optimization problem, in which the\nunbiased stochastic gradient is unavailable. Our approach is applied in a\npopular social network platform with hundreds of millions of daily users and\nachieves +0.22% lift of user engagement in a recommendation task and +1.7% lift\nin revenue in an advertising optimization scenario comparing to using the best\ndeterministic parameter strategy.",

    "abstract": "Single image deraining is important for many high-level computer vision tasks\nsince the rain streaks can severely degrade the visibility of images, thereby\naffecting the recognition and analysis of the image. Recently, many CNN-based\nmethods have been proposed for rain removal. Although these methods can remove\npart of the rain streaks, it is difficult for them to adapt to real-world\nscenarios and restore high-quality rain-free images with clear and accurate\nstructures. To solve this problem, we propose a Structure-Preserving Deraining\nNetwork (SPDNet) with RCP guidance. SPDNet directly generates high-quality\nrain-free images with clear and accurate structures under the guidance of RCP\nbut does not rely on any rain-generating assumptions. Specifically, we found\nthat the RCP of images contains more accurate structural information than rainy\nimages. Therefore, we introduced it to our deraining network to protect\nstructure information of the rain-free image. Meanwhile, a Wavelet-based\nMulti-Level Module (WMLM) is proposed as the backbone for learning the\nbackground information of rainy images and an Interactive Fusion Module (IFM)\nis designed to make full use of RCP information. In addition, an iterative\nguidance strategy is proposed to gradually improve the accuracy of RCP,\nrefining the result in a progressive path. Extensive experimental results on\nboth synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model\nachieves new state-of-the-art results. Code: https://github.com/Joyies/SPDNet",

The technique is based on the iterative computation of\nparameterized invariants, i.e., infinite families of invariants for the\ninfinitely many instances of the system. Safety properties are proved by\nchecking that every global configuration of the system satisfying all\nparameterized invariants also satisfies the property; we have shown that this\ncheck can be reduced to the satisfiability problem for Monadic Second Order on\nwords, which is decidable.\nA strong limitation of the approach is that processes can only have a fixed\nnumber of variables with a fixed finite range. In particular, they cannot use\nvariables with range [0,N-1], where N is the number of processes, which appear\nin many standard distributed algorithms. In this paper, we extend our technique\nto this case. While conducting the check whether a safety property is inductive\nassuming a computed set of invariants becomes undecidable, we show how to\nreduce it to checking satisfiability of a first-order formula.

To fill this research gap,\nfirstly, we develop a theoretical model to characterize the hierarchical\nfederated learning (HFL) algorithm in wireless networks where the mobile users\nmay roam across multiple edge access points, leading to incompletion of\ninconsistent FL training. Secondly, we provide the convergence analysis of HFL\nwith user mobility. Our analysis proves that the learning performance of HFL\ndeteriorates drastically with highly-mobile users.

However, it is difficult to keep the POI database in sync with the\nreal-world counterparts due to the dynamic nature of business changes. To\nalleviate this problem, we formulate and present a practical solution that\njointly extracts POI mentions and identifies their coupled accessibility labels\nfrom unstructured text. We approach this task as a sequence tagging problem,\nwhere the goal is to produce <POI name, accessibility label> pairs from\nunstructured text. This task is challenging because of two main issues: (1) POI\nnames are often newly-coined words so as to successfully register new entities\nor brands and (2) there may exist multiple pairs in the text, which\nnecessitates dealing with one-to-many or many-to-one mapping to make each POI\ncoupled with its accessibility label. To this end, we propose a\nGeographic-Enhanced and Dependency-guIded sequence Tagging (GEDIT) model to\nconcurrently address the two challenges. First, to alleviate challenge #1, we\ndevelop a geographic-enhanced pre-trained model to learn the text\nrepresentations. Second, to mitigate challenge #2, we apply a relational graph\nconvolutional network to learn the tree node representations from the parsed\ndependency tree. Finally, we construct a neural sequence tagging model by\nintegrating and feeding the previously pre-learned representations into a CRF\nlayer. Extensive experiments conducted on a real-world dataset demonstrate the\nsuperiority and effectiveness of GEDIT. In addition, it has already been\ndeployed in production at Baidu Maps. Statistics show that the proposed\nsolution can save significant human effort and labor costs to deal with the\nsame amount of documents, which confirms that it is a practical way for POI\naccessibility maintenance.",

Given\nthe scarcity of domain-specific training data and the high diversity of image\nand language inputs, the generalization of VLN agents to unseen environments\nremains challenging. Recent methods explore pretraining to improve\ngeneralization, however, the use of generic image-caption datasets or existing\nsmall-scale VLN environments is suboptimal and results in limited improvements.\nIn this work, we introduce BnB, a large-scale and diverse in-domain VLN\ndataset.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach for single image defocus\ndeblurring based on inverse kernels. In a defocused image, the blur shapes are\nsimilar among pixels although the blur sizes can spatially vary. To utilize the\nproperty with inverse kernels, we exploit the observation that when only the\nsize of a defocus blur changes while keeping the shape, the shape of the\ncorresponding inverse kernel remains the same and only the scale changes. Based\non the observation, we propose a kernel-sharing parallel atrous convolutional\n(KPAC) block specifically designed by incorporating the property of inverse\nkernels for single image defocus deblurring. To effectively simulate the\ninvariant shapes of inverse kernels with different scales, KPAC shares the same\nconvolutional weights among multiple atrous convolution layers. To efficiently\nsimulate the varying scales of inverse kernels, KPAC consists of only a few\natrous convolution layers with different dilations and learns per-pixel scale\nattentions to aggregate the outputs of the layers. KPAC also utilizes the shape\nattention to combine the outputs of multiple convolution filters in each atrous\nconvolution layer, to deal with defocus blur with a slightly varying shape. We\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a much\nsmaller number of parameters than previous methods.",

    "abstract": "For several emerging technologies such as augmented reality, autonomous\ndriving and robotics, visual localization is a critical component. Directly\nregressing camera pose/3D scene coordinates from the input image using deep\nneural networks has shown great potential. However, such methods assume a\nstationary data distribution with all scenes simultaneously available during\ntraining. In this paper, we approach the problem of visual localization in a\ncontinual learning setup -- whereby the model is trained on scenes in an\nincremental manner. Our results show that similar to the classification domain,\nnon-stationary data induces catastrophic forgetting in deep networks for visual\nlocalization. To address this issue, a strong baseline based on storing and\nreplaying images from a fixed buffer is proposed. Furthermore, we propose a new\nsampling method based on coverage score (Buff-CS) that adapts the existing\nsampling strategies in the buffering process to the problem of visual\nlocalization. Results demonstrate consistent improvements over standard\nbuffering methods on two challenging datasets -- 7Scenes, 12Scenes, and also\n19Scenes by combining the former scenes.",

This allows to directly incorporate\npredefined constraints on the transmission traffic as well as on states and\ninputs. In this article, we examine the practically relevant case when output\ninstead of state measurements are available for feedback, and measurements as\nwell as the plant are subject to uncertainties. To address these challenges, we\nadapt methods from robust tube-based model predictive control and propose three\ndifferent strategies to implement an error feedback in an NCSs setup, the\napplicability of which depends on the capabilities of the actuator. We\nestablish recursive feasibility of the OCP, satisfaction of state and input\nconstraints despite the uncertainties, and convergence. Finally, we illustrate\nour results in a numerical example.",

This attack can be\nrealized in the physical world by printing and attaching the patch to the\nvictim object and thus imposes a real-world threat to computer vision systems.\nTo counter this threat, we propose PatchCleanser as a certifiably robust\ndefense against adversarial patches that is compatible with any image\nclassifier. In PatchCleanser, we perform two rounds of pixel masking on the\ninput image to neutralize the effect of the adversarial patch. In the first\nround of masking, we apply a set of carefully generated masks to the input\nimage and evaluate the model prediction on every masked image. If model\npredictions on all one-masked images reach a unanimous agreement, we output the\nagreed prediction label. Otherwise, we perform a second round of masking to\nsettle the disagreement, in which we evaluate model predictions on two-masked\nimages to robustly recover the correct prediction label. Notably, we can prove\nthat our defense will always make correct predictions on certain images against\nany adaptive white-box attacker within our threat model, achieving certified\nrobustness. We extensively evaluate our defense on the ImageNet, ImageNette,\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and Flowers-102 datasets and demonstrate that our\ndefense achieves similar clean accuracy as state-of-the-art classification\nmodels and also significantly improves certified robustness from prior works.\nNotably, our defense can achieve 83.8% top-1 clean accuracy and 60.4% top-1\ncertified robust accuracy against a 2%-pixel square patch anywhere on the\n1000-class ImageNet dataset.",

    "abstract": "Abundant real-world data can be naturally represented by large-scale\nnetworks, which demands efficient and effective learning algorithms. At the\nsame time, labels may only be available for some networks, which demands these\nalgorithms to be able to adapt to unlabeled networks. Domain-adaptive hash\nlearning has enjoyed considerable success in the computer vision community in\nmany practical tasks due to its lower cost in both retrieval time and storage\nfootprint. However, it has not been applied to multiple-domain networks. In\nthis work, we bridge this gap by developing an unsupervised domain-adaptive\nhash learning method for networks, dubbed UDAH. Specifically, we develop four\n{task-specific yet correlated} components: (1) network structure preservation\nvia a hard groupwise contrastive loss, (2) relaxation-free supervised hashing,\n(3) cross-domain intersected discriminators, and (4) semantic center alignment.\nWe conduct a wide range of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of our method on a range of tasks including link prediction, node\nclassification, and neighbor recommendation.

    "abstract": "Recommender system plays a crucial role in modern E-commerce platform. Due to\nthe lack of historical interactions between users and items, cold-start\nrecommendation is a challenging problem. In order to alleviate the cold-start\nissue, most existing methods introduce content and contextual information as\nthe auxiliary information. Nevertheless, these methods assume the recommended\nitems behave steadily over time, while in a typical E-commerce scenario, items\ngenerally have very different performances throughout their life period. In\nsuch a situation, it would be beneficial to consider the long-term return from\nthe item perspective, which is usually ignored in conventional methods.\nReinforcement learning (RL) naturally fits such a long-term optimization\nproblem, in which the recommender could identify high potential items,\nproactively allocate more user impressions to boost their growth, therefore\nimprove the multi-period cumulative gains. Inspired by this idea, we model the\nprocess as a Partially Observable and Controllable Markov Decision Process\n(POC-MDP), and propose an actor-critic RL framework (RL-LTV) to incorporate the\nitem lifetime values (LTV) into the recommendation. In RL-LTV, the critic\nstudies historical trajectories of items and predict the future LTV of fresh\nitem, while the actor suggests a score-based policy which maximizes the future\nLTV expectation. Scores suggested by the actor are then combined with classical\nranking scores in a dual-rank framework, therefore the recommendation is\nbalanced with the LTV consideration. Our method outperforms the strong live\nbaseline with a relative improvement of 8.67% and 18.03% on IPV and GMV of\ncold-start items, on one of the largest E-commerce platform.",

    "abstract": "Describing images using natural language is widely known as image captioning,\nwhich has made consistent progress due to the development of computer vision\nand natural language generation techniques. Though conventional captioning\nmodels achieve high accuracy based on popular metrics, i.e., BLEU, CIDEr, and\nSPICE, the ability of captions to distinguish the target image from other\nsimilar images is under-explored. To generate distinctive captions, a few\npioneers employ contrastive learning or re-weighted the ground-truth captions,\nwhich focuses on one single input image. However, the relationships between\nobjects in a similar image group (e.g., items or properties within the same\nalbum or fine-grained events) are neglected. In this paper, we improve the\ndistinctiveness of image captions using a Group-based Distinctive Captioning\nModel (GdisCap), which compares each image with other images in one similar\ngroup and highlights the uniqueness of each image. In particular, we propose a\ngroup-based memory attention (GMA) module, which stores object features that\nare unique among the image group (i.e., with low similarity to objects in other\nimages). These unique object features are highlighted when generating captions,\nresulting in more distinctive captions. Furthermore, the distinctive words in\nthe ground-truth captions are selected to supervise the language decoder and\nGMA. Finally, we propose a new evaluation metric, distinctive word rate\n(DisWordRate) to measure the distinctiveness of captions. Quantitative results\nindicate that the proposed method significantly improves the distinctiveness of\nseveral baseline models, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both\naccuracy and distinctiveness. Results of a user study agree with the\nquantitative evaluation and demonstrate the rationality of the new metric\nDisWordRate.",

However, in the recent past, many researchers have focused on Call\nDetail Records (CDR) for identifying travel patterns. CDRs have shown\ncorrelation to human mobility behavior. However, one of the main issues in\nusing CDR data is that it is difficult to identify the precise location of the\nuser due to the low spacial resolution of the data and other artifacts such as\nthe load sharing effect. Existing approaches have certain limitations. Previous\nstudies using CDRs do not consider the transmit power of cell towers when\nlocalizing the users and use an oversimplified approach to identify load\nsharing effects. Furthermore, they consider the entire population of users as\none group neglecting the differences in mobility patterns of different segments\nof users. This research introduces a novel methodology to user position\nlocalization from CDRs through improved detection of load sharing effects, by\ntaking the transmit power into account, and segmenting the users into distinct\ngroups for the purpose of learning any parameters of the model. Moreover, this\nresearch uses several methods to address the existing limitations and validate\nthe generated results using nearly 4 billion CDR data points with travel survey\ndata and voluntarily collected mobile data.",

    "abstract": "Supervised learning is constrained by the availability of labeled data, which\nare especially expensive to acquire in the field of digital pathology. Making\nuse of open-source data for pre-training or using domain adaptation can be a\nway to overcome this issue. However, pre-trained networks often fail to\ngeneralize to new test domains that are not distributed identically due to\nvariations in tissue stainings, types, and textures. Additionally, current\ndomain adaptation methods mainly rely on fully-labeled source datasets. In this\nwork, we propose SRA, which takes advantage of self-supervised learning to\nperform domain adaptation and removes the necessity of a fully-labeled source\ndataset. SRA can effectively transfer the discriminative knowledge obtained\nfrom a few labeled source domain's data to a new target domain without\nrequiring additional tissue annotations. Our method harnesses both domains'\nstructures by capturing visual similarity with intra-domain and cross-domain\nself-supervision.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for estimating the head pose from a single\nimage. This estimation uses a neural network (NN) obtained in two stages. In\nthe first stage, we trained the base NN, which has one regression head and four\nregression via classification (RvC) heads. We build the ensemble of offsets\nusing small offsets of face bounding boxes. In the second stage, we perform\nknowledge distillation (KD) from the ensemble of offsets of the base NN into\nthe final NN with one RvC head. On the main test protocol, the use of the\noffset ensemble improves the results of the base NN, and the KD improves the\nresults from the offset ensemble. The KD improves the results by an average of\n7.7\\% compared to the non-ensemble version. The proposed NN on the main test\nprotocol improves the state-of-the-art result on AFLW2000 and approaches, with\nonly a minimal gap, the state-of-the-art result on BIWI. Our NN uses only head\npose data, but the previous state-of-the-art model also uses facial landmarks\nduring training. We have made publicly available trained NNs and face bounding\nboxes for the 300W-LP, AFLW, AFLW2000, and BIWI datasets. KD-ResNet152 has the\nbest results, and KD-ResNet18 has a better result on the AFLW2000 dataset than\nany previous method.",

    "abstract": "Active learning for object detection is conventionally achieved by applying\ntechniques developed for classification in a way that aggregates individual\ndetections into image-level selection criteria. This is typically coupled with\nthe costly assumption that every image selected for labelling must be\nexhaustively annotated. This yields incremental improvements on well-curated\nvision datasets and struggles in the presence of data imbalance and visual\nclutter that occurs in real-world imagery. Alternatives to the image-level\napproach are surprisingly under-explored in the literature. In this work, we\nintroduce a new strategy that subsumes previous Image-level and Object-level\napproaches into a generalized, Region-level approach that promotes\nspatial-diversity by avoiding nearby redundant queries from the same image and\nminimizes context-switching for the labeler.

    "title": "Quantization Backdoors to Deep Learning Models",
    "abstract": "There is currently a burgeoning demand for deploying deep learning (DL)\nmodels on ubiquitous edge Internet of Things devices attributing to their low\nlatency and high privacy preservation. However, DL models are often large in\nsize and require large-scale computation, which prevents them from being placed\ndirectly onto IoT devices where resources are constrained and 32-bit\nfloating-point operations are unavailable. Model quantization is a pragmatic\nsolution, which enables DL deployment on mobile devices and embedded systems by\neffortlessly post-quantizing a large high-precision model into a small\nlow-precision model while retaining the model inference accuracy.\nThis work reveals that the standard quantization operation can be abused to\nactivate a backdoor. We demonstrate that a full-precision backdoored model that\ndoes not have any backdoor effect in the presence of a trigger -- as the\nbackdoor is dormant -- can be activated by the default TensorFlow-Lite\nquantization, the only product-ready quantization framework to date. We\nascertain that all trained float-32 backdoored models exhibit no backdoor\neffect even in the presence of trigger inputs. State-of-the-art frontend\ndetection approaches, such as Neural Cleanse and STRIP, fail to identify the\nbackdoor in the float-32 models. When each of the float-32 models is converted\ninto an int-8 format model through the standard TFLite post-training\nquantization, the backdoor is activated in the quantized model, which shows a\nstable attack success rate close to 100% upon inputs with the trigger, while\nbehaves normally upon non-trigger inputs. This work highlights that a stealthy\nsecurity threat occurs when end users utilize the on-device post-training model\nquantization toolkits, informing security researchers of cross-platform\noverhaul of DL models post quantization even if they pass frontend inspections.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have transformed the area of\nsemantic text matching. However, most of the state-of-the-art models are\ndesigned to operate with short documents such as tweets, user reviews,\ncomments, etc., and have fundamental limitations when applied to long-form\ndocuments such as scientific papers, legal documents, and patents. When\nhandling such long documents, there are three primary challenges: (i) The\npresence of different contexts for the same word throughout the document, (ii)\nSmall sections of contextually similar text between two documents, but\ndissimilar text in the remaining parts -- this defies the basic understanding\nof \"similarity\", and (iii) The coarse nature of a single global similarity\nmeasure which fails to capture the heterogeneity of the document content. In\nthis paper, we describe CoLDE: Contrastive Long Document Encoder -- a\ntransformer-based framework that addresses these challenges and allows for\ninterpretable comparisons of long documents. CoLDE uses unique positional\nembeddings and a multi-headed chunkwise attention layer in conjunction with a\ncontrastive learning framework to capture similarity at three different levels:\n(i) high-level similarity scores between a pair of documents, (ii) similarity\nscores between different sections within and across documents, and (iii)\nsimilarity scores between different chunks in the same document and also other\ndocuments. These fine-grained similarity scores aid in better interpretability.\nWe evaluate CoLDE on three long document datasets namely, ACL Anthology\npublications, Wikipedia articles, and USPTO patents. Besides outperforming the\nstate-of-the-art methods on the document comparison task, CoLDE also proves\ninterpretable and robust to changes in document length and text perturbations.",

An IDS distinguishes the malicious traffic\nfrom the benign one and determines the attack types targeting the assets of the\norganization. The main challenge of an IDS is facing new (i.e., zero-day)\nattacks and separating them from benign traffic and existing types of attacks.\nAlong with the power of the deep learning-based IDSes in auto-extracting\nhigh-level features and its independence from the time-consuming and costly\nsignature extraction process, the mentioned challenge still exists in this new\ngeneration of IDSes.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework for deep learning-based IDSes\naddressing new attacks.

Additionally, we\nintroduce DOC++ as a newer version of DOC as a deep novelty-based classifier.\nWe also employ the Deep Intrusion Detection (DID) framework for the\npreprocessing phase, which improves the ability of deep learning algorithms to\ndetect content-based attacks. We compare four different algorithms (including\nDOC, DOC++, OpenMax, and AutoSVM) as the novelty classifier of the framework\nand use both the CIC-IDS2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets for the evaluation.\nOur results show that DOC++ is the best implementation of the open set\nrecognition module.

To\nsolve this task, we propose to teach machines to generate definition-like\nrelation descriptions by letting them learn from definitions of entities.\nSpecifically, we fine-tune Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to produce\ndefinitions conditioned on extracted entity pairs. To help PLMs reason between\nentities and provide additional relational knowledge to PLMs for open relation\nmodeling, we incorporate reasoning paths in KGs and include a reasoning path\nselection mechanism. We show that PLMs can select interpretable and informative\nreasoning paths by confidence estimation, and the selected path can guide PLMs\nto generate better relation descriptions. Experimental results show that our\nmodel can generate concise but informative relation descriptions that capture\nthe representative characteristics of entities and relations.",

    "abstract": "Specification mining offers a solution by automating security specification\nfor hardware. Specification miners use a form of machine learning to specify\nbehaviors of a system by studying a system in execution. However, specification\nmining was first developed for use with software. Complex hardware designs\noffer unique challenges for this technique. Further, specification miners\ntraditionally capture functional specifications without a notion of security,\nand may not use the specification logics necessary to describe some security\nrequirements.\nThis work demonstrates specification mining for hardware security. On CISC\narchitectures such as x86, I demonstrate that a miner partitioning the design\nstate space along control signals discovers a specification that includes\nmanually defined properties and, if followed, would secure CPU designs against\nMemory Sinkhole and SYSRET privilege escalation. For temporal properties, I\ndemonstrate that a miner using security specific linear temporal logic (LTL)\ntemplates for specification detection may find properties that, if followed,\nwould secure designs against historical documented security vulnerabilities and\nagainst potential future attacks targeting system initialization. For\ninformation--flow hyperproperties, I demonstrate that a miner may use\nInformation Flow Tracking (IFT) to develop output properties containing\ndesigner specified information--flow security properties as well as properties\nthat demonstrate a design does not contain certain Common Weakness Enumerations\n(CWEs).",

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of multi-server Private Linear Computation,\nunder the joint and individual privacy guarantees. In this problem, identical\ncopies of a dataset comprised of $K$ messages are stored on $N$ non-colluding\nservers, and a user wishes to obtain one linear combination of a $D$-subset of\nmessages belonging to the dataset. The goal is to design a scheme for\nperforming the computation such that the total amount of information downloaded\nfrom the servers is minimized, while the privacy of the $D$ messages required\nfor the computation is protected. When joint privacy is required, the\nidentities of all of these $D$ messages must be kept private jointly, and when\nindividual privacy is required, the identity of every one of these $D$ messages\nmust be kept private individually. In this work, we characterize the capacity,\nwhich is defined as the maximum achievable download rate, under both joint and\nindividual privacy requirements. In particular, we show that the capacity is\ngiven respectively by ${(1+1/N+\\dots+1/N^{K-D})^{-1}}$ or\n${(1+1/N+\\dots+1/N^{\\lceil K/D\\rceil-1})^{-1}}$ when joint or individual\nprivacy is required. Our converse proofs are based on reduction from two\nvariants of the multi-server Private Information Retrieval problem in the\npresence of side information. Our achievability schemes build up on our\nrecently proposed schemes for single-server Private Linear Transformation and\nthe multi-server private computation scheme proposed by Sun and Jafar. Using\nsimilar proof techniques, we also establish upper and lower bounds on the\ncapacity for the cases in which the user wants to compute $L$ (potentially more\nthan one) linear combinations. Specifically, we show that the capacity is upper\nand lower bounded respectively by ${(1+1/N+\\dots+1/N^{(K-D)/L})^{-1}}$ and\n${(1+1/N+\\dots+1/N^{K-D+L-1})^{-1}}$, when joint privacy is required.",

    "abstract": "Multi-label zero-shot learning (ZSL) is a more realistic counter-part of\nstandard single-label ZSL since several objects can co-exist in a natural\nimage. However, the occurrence of multiple objects complicates the reasoning\nand requires region-specific processing of visual features to preserve their\ncontextual cues. We note that the best existing multi-label ZSL method takes a\nshared approach towards attending to region features with a common set of\nattention maps for all the classes. Such shared maps lead to diffused\nattention, which does not discriminatively focus on relevant locations when the\nnumber of classes are large. Moreover, mapping spatially-pooled visual features\nto the class semantics leads to inter-class feature entanglement, thus\nhampering the classification. Here, we propose an alternate approach towards\nregion-based discriminability-preserving multi-label zero-shot classification.\nOur approach maintains the spatial resolution to preserve region-level\ncharacteristics and utilizes a bi-level attention module (BiAM) to enrich the\nfeatures by incorporating both region and scene context information. The\nenriched region-level features are then mapped to the class semantics and only\ntheir class predictions are spatially pooled to obtain image-level predictions,\nthereby keeping the multi-class features disentangled. Our approach sets a new\nstate of the art on two large-scale multi-label zero-shot benchmarks: NUS-WIDE\nand Open Images.

    "title": "Optimised Multithreaded CV-QKD Reconciliation for Global Quantum  Networks",
    "abstract": "Designing a practical Continuous Variable (CV) Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)\nsystem requires an estimation of the quantum channel characteristics and the\nextraction of secure key bits based on a large number of distributed quantum\nsignals. Meeting this requirement in short timescales is difficult. On standard\nprocessors, it can take several hours to reconcile the required number of\nquantum signals. This problem is exasperated in the context of Low Earth Orbit\n(LEO) satellite CV-QKD, in which the satellite flyover time is constrained to\nbe less than a few minutes. A potential solution to this problem is massive\nparallelisation of the classical reconciliation process in which a large-code\nblock is subdivided into many shorter blocks for individual decoding. However,\nthe penalty of this procedure on the important final secured key rate is\nnon-trivial to determine and hitherto has not been formally analysed. Ideally,\na determination of the optimal reduced block size, maximising the final key\nrate, would be forthcoming in such an analysis. In this work, we fill this\nimportant knowledge gap via detailed analyses and experimental verification of\na CV-QKD sliced reconciliation protocol that uses large block-length\nlow-density parity-check decoders. Our new solution results in a significant\nincrease in the final key rate relative to non-optimised reconciliation. In\naddition, it allows for the acquisition of quantum secured messages between\nterrestrial stations and LEO satellites within a flyover timescale even using\noff-the-shelf processors. Our work points the way to optimised global quantum\nnetworks secured via fundamental physics.",

    "abstract": "Knowing the causal structure of a system is of fundamental interest in many\nareas of science and can aid the design of prediction algorithms that work well\nunder manipulations to the system. The causal structure becomes identifiable\nfrom the observational distribution under certain restrictions. To learn the\nstructure from data, score-based methods evaluate different graphs according to\nthe quality of their fits. However, for large nonlinear models, these rely on\nheuristic optimization approaches with no general guarantees of recovering the\ntrue causal structure. In this paper, we consider structure learning of\ndirected trees. We propose a fast and scalable method based on Chu-Liu-Edmonds'\nalgorithm we call causal additive trees (CAT). For the case of Gaussian errors,\nwe prove consistency in an asymptotic regime with a vanishing identifiability\ngap. We also introduce a method for testing substructure hypotheses with\nasymptotic family-wise error rate control that is valid post-selection and in\nunidentified settings. Furthermore, we study the identifiability gap, which\nquantifies how much better the true causal model fits the observational\ndistribution, and prove that it is lower bounded by local properties of the\ncausal model. Simulation studies demonstrate the favorable performance of CAT\ncompared to competing structure learning methods.",

Further, to adapt to the uncertainties of the\nmmWave channel, we consider a pessimistic estimate of the rates over link\nblockage combinations and an adaptive selection of the CoMP serving set from\nthe available remote radio units (RRUs).

    "abstract": "Optimization in distributed networks plays a central role in almost all\ndistributed machine learning problems. In principle, the use of distributed\ntask allocation has reduced the computational time, allowing better response\nrates and higher data reliability. However, for these computational algorithms\nto run effectively in complex distributed systems, the algorithms ought to\ncompensate for communication asynchrony, network node failures and delays known\nas stragglers. These issues can change the effective connection topology of the\nnetwork, which may vary over time, thus hindering the optimization process. In\nthis paper, we propose a new distributed unconstrained optimization algorithm\nfor minimizing a convex function which is adaptable to a parameter server\nnetwork. In particular, the network worker nodes solve their local optimization\nproblems, allowing the computation of their local coded gradients, which will\nbe sent to different server nodes. Then within this parameter server platform\neach server node aggregates its communicated local gradients, allowing\nconvergence to the desired optimizer. This algorithm is robust to network s\nworker node failures, disconnection, or delaying nodes known as stragglers. One\nway to overcome the straggler problem is to allow coding over the network. We\nfurther extend this coding framework to enhance the convergence of the proposed\nalgorithm under such varying network topologies. By using coding and utilizing\nevaluations of gradients of uniformly bounded delay we further enhance the\nproposed algorithm performance. Finally, we implement the proposed scheme in\nMATLAB and provide comparative results demonstrating the effectiveness of the\nproposed framework",

A novel two-phase sensing framework is proposed to\nlocalize the passive targets that cannot transmit/receive reference signals\nto/from the base stations (BSs), where the ranges of the targets are estimated\nbased on their reflected OFDM signals to the BSs in Phase I, and the location\nof each target is estimated based on its values of distance to the BSs in Phase\nII. Specifically, in Phase I, we design a model-free range estimation approach\nby leveraging the OFDM channel estimation technique for determining the delay\nvalues of all the BS-target-BS paths, which does not rely on any BS-target\nchannel model. In Phase II, we reveal that ghost targets may be falsely\ndetected in some cases as all the targets reflect the same signals to the BSs,\nwhich thus do not know how to match each estimated range with the right target.\nInterestingly, we show that the above issue is not a fundamental limitation for\ndevice-free sensing: under the ideal case of perfect range estimation in Phase\nI, the probability for ghost targets to exist is proved to be negligible when\nthe targets are randomly located. Moreover, under the practical case of\nimperfect range estimation, we propose an efficient algorithm for joint range\nmatching and target localization.

To establish these results, we prove novel and sharp\nconfidence intervals for GP models applicable to RKHS elements which may be of\nbroader interest.",

    "title": "Approximate Bayesian Neural Doppler Imaging",
    "abstract": "The non-uniform surface temperature distribution of rotating active stars is\nroutinely mapped with the Doppler Imaging technique. Inhomogeneities in the\nsurface produce features in high-resolution spectroscopic observations that\nshift in wavelength depending on their position on the visible hemisphere. The\ninversion problem has been systematically solved using maximum a-posteriori\nregularized methods assuming smoothness or maximum entropy. Our aim in this\nwork is to solve the full Bayesian inference problem, by providing access to\nthe posterior distribution of the surface temperature in the star. We use\namortized neural posterior estimation to produce a model that approximates the\nhigh-dimensional posterior distribution for spectroscopic observations of\nselected spectral ranges sampled at arbitrary rotation phases. The posterior\ndistribution is approximated with conditional normalizing flows, which are\nflexible, tractable and easy to sample approximations to arbitrary\ndistributions. When conditioned on the spectroscopic observations, they provide\na very efficient way of obtaining samples from the posterior distribution. The\nconditioning on observations is obtained through the use of Transformer\nencoders, which can deal with arbitrary wavelength sampling and rotation\nphases. Our model can produce thousands of posterior samples per second. Our\nvalidation of the model for very high signal-to-noise observations shows that\nit correctly approximates the posterior, although with some overestimation of\nthe broadening. We apply the model to the moderately fast rotator II Peg,\nproducing the first Bayesian map of its temperature inhomogenities. We conclude\nthat conditional normalizing flows are a very promising tool to carry out\napproximate Bayesian inference in more complex problems in stellar physics,\nlike constraining the magnetic properties.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we analyzed one month of Call Detail Records, covering\nBudapest in June, 2016. During this observation period, the 2016 UEFA European\nFootball Championship took place, where the Hungarian national football team\ndid well, beyond expectations. This case study focuses on the fans' behavior in\nBudapest, during and after the Hungarian matches, from the perspective of the\nmobile phone network data. Tense rooting, joy of scoring a goal,\nself-forgetting celebration because of winning the group. All of these have an\neffect on the data, that can be simply revealed. We used descriptive\nstatistical methods to analyze the available data set, and managed to\ndemonstrate the potential of this kind of data at social sensing. We found that\nthe mobile phone network activity reflects the football fans' behavior, even if\nthe match is played in another country.",

Subsequently, we\nintroduce a modular object-oriented structure for our smart AMR algorithm. Then\nwe present procedures used for the training of a smart AMR model.
