Examples are $k$-Means,\nGeometric $k$-Median/Center, Continuous Facility Location, $m$-Variance, etc.\nWe prove that, for any fixed $\\varepsilon>0$, every set of $n$ input points in\nfixed-dimensional space with the metric induced by any vector norm admits a set\nof $O(n)$ candidate centers which can be computed in almost linear time and\nwhich contains a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation of each point of space with\nrespect to the distances to all the input points. It gives a universal\napproximation-preserving reduction of geometric center-based problems with\narbitrary continuity-type objective functions to their discrete versions where\nthe centers are selected from a fairly small set of candidates.

    "abstract": "With recent progress in joint modeling of visual and textual representations,\nVision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has achieved impressive performance on many\nmultimodal downstream tasks. However, the requirement for expensive annotations\nincluding clean image captions and regional labels limits the scalability of\nexisting approaches, and complicates the pretraining procedure with the\nintroduction of multiple dataset-specific objectives. In this work, we relax\nthese constraints and present a minimalist pretraining framework, named Simple\nVisual Language Model (SimVLM). Unlike prior work, SimVLM reduces the training\ncomplexity by exploiting large-scale weak supervision, and is trained\nend-to-end with a single prefix language modeling objective. Without utilizing\nextra data or task-specific customization, the resulting model significantly\noutperforms previous pretraining methods and achieves new state-of-the-art\nresults on a wide range of discriminative and generative vision-language\nbenchmarks, including VQA (+3.74% vqa-score), NLVR2 (+1.17% accuracy), SNLI-VE\n(+1.37% accuracy) and image captioning tasks (+10.1% average CIDEr score).\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that SimVLM acquires strong generalization and\ntransfer ability, enabling zero-shot behavior including open-ended visual\nquestion answering and cross-modality transfer.",

It has been\nreported that text clustering algorithms are hard to achieve better performance\nthan supervised methods and their clustering performance is highly dependent on\nthe picked text features. Currently, there are many different types of text\nfeature generation algorithms, each of which extracts text features from some\nspecific aspects, such as VSM and distributed word embedding, thus seeking a\nnew way of obtaining features as complete as possible from the corpus is the\nkey to enhance the clustering effects.

The\nexperimental tests show our HMFF framework outperforms other recently published\nalgorithms on 7 of 11 public benchmark datasets and has the leading performance\non the rest 4 benchmark datasets as well.

Existing research has revealed that\ncommuter comfort not only varies at a personalized level but also is perceived\ndifferently on different trips for the same commuter. Furthermore, there are\nseveral factors, including driving behavior and driving environment, affecting\nthe perception of comfort. Automatically extracting the perceived comfort level\nof a commuter due to the impact of the driving behavior is crucial for a timely\nfeedback to the drivers, which can help them to meet the commuter's\nsatisfaction. In light of this, we surveyed around 200 commuters who usually\ntake such cab rides and obtained a set of features that impact comfort during\ncab rides. Following this, we develop a system Ridergo which collects\nsmartphone sensor data from a commuter, extracts the spatial time series\nfeature from the data, and then computes the level of commuter comfort on a\nfive-point scale with respect to the driving. Ridergo uses a Hierarchical\nTemporal Memory model-based approach to observe anomalies in the feature\ndistribution and then trains a Multi-task learning-based neural network model\nto obtain the comfort level of the commuter at a personalized level. The model\nalso intelligently queries the commuter to add new data points to the available\ndataset and, in turn, improve itself over periodic training. Evaluation of\nRidergo on 30 participants shows that the system could provide efficient\ncomfort score with high accuracy when the driving impacts the perceived\ncomfort.",

To address this issue, unsupervised domain adaptation can be used\ntransfer knowledge from the labeled synthetic source domain and learn a\nclassifier for the unlabeled real target domain. To tackle this challenge of\nsingle view 3D reconstruction in the real domain, we experiment with a variety\nof domain adaptation techniques inspired by the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD)\nloss, Deep CORAL, and the domain adversarial neural network (DANN). From these\nfindings, we additionally propose a novel architecture which takes advantage of\nthe fact that in this setting, target domain data is unsupervised with regards\nto the 3D model but supervised for class labels. We base our framework off a\nrecent network called pix2vox.

One approach to learn the sequence of events is\nto study the order of sentences in a coherent text. Sentence ordering can be\napplied in various tasks such as retrieval-based Question Answering, document\nsummarization, storytelling, text generation, and dialogue systems.\nFurthermore, we can learn to model text coherence by learning how to order a\nset of shuffled sentences. Previous research has relied on RNN, LSTM, and\nBiLSTM architecture for learning text language models. However, these networks\nhave performed poorly due to the lack of attention mechanisms. We propose an\nalgorithm for sentence ordering in a corpus of short stories. Our proposed\nmethod uses a language model based on Universal Transformers (UT) that captures\nsentences' dependencies by employing an attention mechanism. Our method\nimproves the previous state-of-the-art in terms of Perfect Match Ratio (PMR)\nscore in the ROCStories dataset, a corpus of nearly 100K short human-made\nstories. The proposed model includes three components: Sentence Encoder,\nLanguage Model, and Sentence Arrangement with Brute Force Search. The first\ncomponent generates sentence embeddings using SBERT-WK pre-trained model\nfine-tuned on the ROCStories data. Then a Universal Transformer network\ngenerates a sentence-level language model. For decoding, the network generates\na candidate sentence as the following sentence of the current sentence. We use\ncosine similarity as a scoring function to assign scores to the candidate\nembedding and the embeddings of other sentences in the shuffled set. Then a\nBrute Force Search is employed to maximize the sum of similarities between\npairs of consecutive sentences.",

    "abstract": "The emerging wide area monitoring systems (WAMS) have brought significant\nimprovements in electric grids' situational awareness. However, the newly\nintroduced system can potentially increase the risk of cyber-attacks, which may\nbe disguised as normal physical disturbances. This paper deals with the event\nand intrusion detection problem by leveraging a stream data mining classifier\n(Hoeffding adaptive tree) with semi-supervised learning techniques to\ndistinguish cyber-attacks from regular system perturbations accurately. First,\nour proposed approach builds a dictionary by learning higher-level features\nfrom unlabeled data. Then, the labeled data are represented as sparse linear\ncombinations of learned dictionary atoms. We capitalize on those sparse codes\nto train the online classifier along with efficient change detectors. We\nconduct numerical experiments with industrial control systems cyber-attack\ndatasets. We consider five different scenarios: short-circuit faults, line\nmaintenance, remote tripping command injection, relay setting change, as well\nas false data injection. The data are generated based on a modified IEEE 9-bus\nsystem. Simulation results show that our proposed approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art method.",

    "abstract": "The hypothesis that image datasets gathered online \"in the wild\" can produce\nbiased object recognizers, e.g. preferring professional photography or certain\nviewing angles, is studied. A new \"in the lab\" data collection infrastructure\nis proposed consisting of a drone which captures images as it circles around\nobjects.

It's inexpensive and easily\nreplicable nature may also potentially lead to a scalable data collection\neffort by the vision community. The procedure's usefulness is demonstrated by\ncreating a dataset of Objects Obtained With fLight (OOWL). Denoted as OOWL500,\nit contains 120,000 images of 500 objects and is the largest \"in the lab\" image\ndataset available when both number of classes and objects per class are\nconsidered. Furthermore, it has enabled several of new insights on object\nrecognition. First, a novel adversarial attack strategy is proposed, where\nimage perturbations are defined in terms of semantic properties such as camera\nshake and pose. Indeed, experiments have shown that ImageNet has considerable\namounts of pose and professional photography bias. Second, it is used to show\nthat the augmentation of in the wild datasets, such as ImageNet, with in the\nlab data, such as OOWL500, can significantly decrease these biases, leading to\nobject recognizers of improved generalization. Third, the dataset is used to\nstudy questions on \"best procedures\" for dataset collection. It is revealed\nthat data augmentation with synthetic images does not suffice to eliminate in\nthe wild datasets biases, and that camera shake and pose diversity play a more\nimportant role in object recognition robustness than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Background: Pull-based development has shaped the practice of Modern Code\nReview (MCR), in which reviewers can contribute code improvements, such as\nrefactorings, through comments and commits in Pull Requests (PRs). Past MCR\nstudies uniformly treat all PRs, regardless of whether they induce refactoring\nor not. We define a PR as refactoring-inducing, when refactoring edits are\nperformed after the initial commit(s), as either a result of discussion among\nreviewers or spontaneous actions carried out by the PR developer. Aims: This\nmixed study (quantitative and qualitative) explores code reviewing-related\naspects intending to characterize refactoring-inducing PRs. Method: We\nhypothesize that refactoring-inducing PRs have distinct characteristics than\nnon-refactoring-inducing ones and thus deserve special attention and treatment\nfrom researchers, practitioners, and tool builders. To investigate our\nhypothesis, we mined a sample of 1,845 Apache's merged PRs from GitHub, mined\nrefactoring edits in these PRs, and ran a comparative study between\nrefactoring-inducing and non-refactoring-inducing PRs. We also manually\nexamined 2,096 review comments and 1,891 detected refactorings from 228\nrefactoring-inducing PRs. Results: We found 30.2% of refactoring-inducing PRs\nin our sample and that they significantly differ from non-refactoring-inducing\nones in terms of number of commits, code churn, number of file changes, number\nof review comments, length of discussion, and time to merge. However, we found\nno statistical evidence that the number of reviewers is related to\nrefactoring-inducement. Our qualitative analysis revealed that at least one\nrefactoring edit was induced by review in 133 (58.3%) of the\nrefactoring-inducing PRs examined. Conclusions: Our findings suggest directions\nfor researchers, practitioners, and tool builders to improve practices around\npull-based code review.",

    "abstract": "In this chapter, the regulation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)\ncommunication network is investigated in the presence of dynamic changes in the\nUAV lineup and user distribution. We target an optimal UAV control policy which\nis capable of identifying the upcoming change in the UAV lineup (quit or\njoin-in) or user distribution, and proactively relocating the UAVs ahead of the\nchange rather than passively dispatching the UAVs after the change.\nSpecifically, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based UAV control framework\nis developed to maximize the accumulated user satisfaction (US) score for a\ngiven time horizon which is able to handle the change in both the UAV lineup\nand user distribution. The framework accommodates the changed dimension of the\nstate-action space before and after the UAV lineup change by deliberate state\ntransition design. In addition, to handle the continuous state and action\nspace, deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, which is an\nactor-critic based DRL, is exploited. Furthermore, to promote the learning\nexploration around the timing of the change, the original DDPG is adapted into\nan asynchronous parallel computing (APC) structure which leads to a better\ntraining performance in both the critic and actor networks. Finally, extensive\nsimulations are conducted to validate the convergence of the proposed learning\napproach, and demonstrate its capability in jointly handling the dynamics in\nUAV lineup and user distribution as well as its superiority over a passive\nreaction method.",

We then propose an\nimproved version of DARTS, namely iDARTS, to deal with the two problems. In the\ntraining phase, it introduces node normalization to maintain the norm balance.\nIn the discretization phase, the continuous architecture is approximated based\non the similarity between the outputs of the node and the decorrelated\noperations rather than the values of the architecture parameters.

However, it is difficult for box-wise anchors to\nguide the adaptive learning of scale-specific features in each layer because\nthere is no one-to-one correspondence between box-wise anchors and pixel-level\nfeatures. In order to alleviate the problem, in this paper, we propose a\nscale-customized weak segmentation (SCWS) block at the pixel level for scale\ncustomized object feature learning in each layer.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in learning\nbetter representations by performing feature propagation and transformation\niteratively to leverage neighborhood information. Nevertheless, iterative\npropagation restricts the information of higher-layer neighborhoods to be\ntransported through and fused with the lower-layer neighborhoods', which\nunavoidably results in feature smoothing between neighborhoods in different\nlayers and can thus compromise the performance, especially on heterophily\nnetworks. Furthermore, most deep GNNs only recognize the importance of\nhigher-layer neighborhoods while yet to fully explore the importance of\nmulti-hop dependency within the context of different layer neighborhoods in\nlearning better representations. In this work, we first theoretically analyze\nthe feature smoothing between neighborhoods in different layers and empirically\ndemonstrate the variance of the homophily level across neighborhoods at\ndifferent layers. Motivated by these analyses, we further propose a tree\ndecomposition method to disentangle neighborhoods in different layers to\nalleviate feature smoothing among these layers. Moreover, we characterize the\nmulti-hop dependency via graph diffusion within our tree decomposition\nformulation to construct Tree Decomposed Graph Neural Network (TDGNN), which\ncan flexibly incorporate information from large receptive fields and aggregate\nthis information utilizing the multi-hop dependency. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superior performance of TDGNN on both homophily and heterophily\nnetworks under a variety of node classification settings.

In this work, we propose EncoderMI, the first membership\ninference method against image encoders pre-trained by contrastive learning. In\nparticular, given an input and a black-box access to an image encoder,\nEncoderMI aims to infer whether the input is in the training dataset of the\nimage encoder. EncoderMI can be used 1) by a data owner to audit whether its\n(public) data was used to pre-train an image encoder without its authorization\nor 2) by an attacker to compromise privacy of the training data when it is\nprivate/sensitive. Our EncoderMI exploits the overfitting of the image encoder\ntowards its training data. In particular, an overfitted image encoder is more\nlikely to output more (or less) similar feature vectors for two augmented\nversions of an input in (or not in) its training dataset. We evaluate EncoderMI\non image encoders pre-trained on multiple datasets by ourselves as well as the\nContrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) image encoder, which is\npre-trained on 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the Internet and\nreleased by OpenAI. Our results show that EncoderMI can achieve high accuracy,\nprecision, and recall. We also explore a countermeasure against EncoderMI via\npreventing overfitting through early stopping. Our results show that it\nachieves trade-offs between accuracy of EncoderMI and utility of the image\nencoder, i.e., it can reduce the accuracy of EncoderMI, but it also incurs\nclassification accuracy loss of the downstream classifiers built based on the\nimage encoder.",

    "abstract": "In Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL), a suspiciousness score is\nassigned to each code element based on test coverage and test outcomes. The\nscores are then used to rank the code elements relative to each other in order\nto aid the programmer during the debugging process when seeking the source of a\nfault. However, probably none of the known SBFL formulae are guaranteed to\nproduce different scores for all the program elements, hence ties emerge\nbetween the code elements. Based on our experiments, ties in SBFL are\nprevalent: in Defects4J, 54-56% of buggy methods are members of ties, i.e.,\nthere is at least one other method with the same score in these cases (but\ntypically much more, on average 6), and this inevitably reduces the\neffectiveness of any SBFL approach. In this work, we present a technique to\nbreak ties in such cases based on the so-called method calls frequencies. This\ncounts the number of different contexts of method calls (both as callees and as\ncallers) in failing test cases. The intuition is that if a method appears in\nmany different calling contexts during a failing test case, it will be more\nsuspicious and get a higher rank position compared to other methods with the\nsame scores. This method can be applied to any underlying SBFL formula, and can\nfavourably break the occurring ranks in the ties in many cases. The\nexperimental results show that our novel tie-breaking strategy achieved a\nsignificant reduction in both size and number of critical ties in our\nbenchmark. In 72-73% of the cases, the ties were completely eliminated and the\naverage reduction rate was more than 80%.",

    "abstract": "It is appealing but challenging to achieve real-time deep neural network\n(DNN) inference on mobile devices because even the powerful modern mobile\ndevices are considered as ``resource-constrained'' when executing large-scale\nDNNs. It necessitates the sparse model inference via weight pruning, i.e., DNN\nweight sparsity, and it is desirable to design a new DNN weight sparsity scheme\nthat can facilitate real-time inference on mobile devices while preserving a\nhigh sparse model accuracy. This paper designs a novel mobile inference\nacceleration framework GRIM that is General to both convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and that achieves\nReal-time execution and high accuracy, leveraging fine-grained structured\nsparse model Inference and compiler optimizations for Mobiles. We start by\nproposing a new fine-grained structured sparsity scheme through the Block-based\nColumn-Row (BCR) pruning. Based on this new fine-grained structured sparsity,\nour GRIM framework consists of two parts: (a) the compiler optimization and\ncode generation for real-time mobile inference; and (b) the BCR pruning\noptimizations for determining pruning hyperparameters and performing weight\npruning. We compare GRIM with Alibaba MNN, TVM, TensorFlow-Lite, a sparse\nimplementation based on CSR, PatDNN, and ESE (a representative FPGA inference\nacceleration framework for RNNs), and achieve up to 14.08x speedup.",

    "abstract": "The existence of noisy data is prevalent in both the training and testing\nphases of machine learning systems, which inevitably leads to the degradation\nof model performance. There have been plenty of works concentrated on learning\nwith in-distribution (IND) noisy labels in the last decade, i.e., some training\nsamples are assigned incorrect labels that do not correspond to their true\nclasses. Nonetheless, in real application scenarios, it is necessary to\nconsider the influence of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, i.e., samples that\ndo not belong to any known classes, which has not been sufficiently explored\nyet. To remedy this, we study a new problem setup, namely Learning with\nOpen-world Noisy Data (LOND). The goal of LOND is to simultaneously learn a\nclassifier and an OOD detector from datasets with mixed IND and OOD noise. In\nthis paper, we propose a new graph-based framework, namely Noisy Graph Cleaning\n(NGC), which collects clean samples by leveraging geometric structure of data\nand model predictive confidence. Without any additional training effort, NGC\ncan detect and reject the OOD samples based on the learned class prototypes\ndirectly in testing phase.

In this work, we study two-sided deception, where we\nmanipulate the observed configuration of both honeypots and real machines.

In an experiment, we study three conditions:\ndefault features on both honeypot and real machines, concealed honeypots only,\nand concealed both honeypots and real machines. We use a network with 40\nmachines where 20 of them are honeypots. We manipulate the features of the\nmachines, and using an experimental testbed (HackIT), we test the effectiveness\nof the decoying strategies against humans attackers.

At the same time, deep language models have been shown\nto outperform traditional bag-of-words rerankers. However, it is unclear how to\nintegrate PRF directly with emergent deep language models. In this article, we\naddress this gap by investigating methods for integrating PRF signals into\nrerankers and dense retrievers based on deep language models. We consider\ntext-based and vector-based PRF approaches, and investigate different ways of\ncombining and scoring relevance signals. An extensive empirical evaluation was\nconducted across four different datasets and two task settings (retrieval and\nranking).\nText-based PRF results show that the use of PRF had a mixed effect on deep\nrerankers across different datasets. We found that the best effectiveness was\nachieved when (i) directly concatenating each PRF passage with the query,\nsearching with the new set of queries, and then aggregating the scores; (ii)\nusing Borda to aggregate scores from PRF runs.\nVector-based PRF results show that the use of PRF enhanced the effectiveness\nof deep rerankers and dense retrievers over several evaluation metrics. We\nfound that higher effectiveness was achieved when (i) the query retains either\nthe majority or the same weight within the PRF mechanism, and (ii) a shallower\nPRF signal (i.e., a smaller number of top-ranked passages) was employed, rather\nthan a deeper signal.

However, the lack of precisely interpreting kernels in convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) is becoming one main obstacle to wide applications of\ndeep learning models in real scenarios. Although existing interpretation\nmethods may find certain visual patterns which are associated with the\nactivation of a specific kernel, those visual patterns may not be specific or\ncomprehensive enough for interpretation of a specific activation of kernel of\ninterest. In this paper, a simple yet effective optimization method is proposed\nto interpret the activation of any kernel of interest in CNN models.

In this way,\nonly visual information relevant to the activation of the specific kernel is\nremained in the input.

The dataset has not been specifically tailored for the model\nemulation task. We employ two neural network architectures for the emulation\ntask: densely connected feed-forward neural network (FFNN), and gated recurrent\nunit feeding into FFNN (GRU-FFNN), a type of a recurrent neural network.\nVarious configurations of the architectures are trialled. A minimum correlation\nstatistic is employed to identify clusters of APSIM scenarios that can be\naggregated to form training sets for model emulation. We focus on emulating\nfour important outputs of the APSIM model: runoff, soil_loss, DINrunoff,\nNleached. The GRU-FFNN architecture with three hidden layers and 128 units per\nlayer provides good emulation of runoff and DINrunoff. However, soil_loss and\nNleached were emulated relatively poorly under a wide range of the considered\narchitectures; the emulators failed to capture variability at higher values of\nthese two outputs. While the opportunistic data available from past modelling\nactivities provides a large and useful dataset for exploring APSIM emulation,\nit may not be sufficiently rich enough for successful deep learning of more\ncomplex model dynamics. Design of Computer Experiments may be required to\ngenerate more informative data to emulate all output variables of interest. We\nalso suggest the use of synthetic meteorology settings to allow the model to be\nfed a wide range of inputs.

    "abstract": "We consider decentralized consensus optimization when workers sample data\nfrom non-identical distributions and perform variable amounts of work due to\nslow nodes known as stragglers. The problem of non-identical distributions and\nthe problem of variable amount of work have been previously studied separately.\nIn our work we analyze them together under a unified system model. We study the\nconvergence of the optimization algorithm when combining worker outputs under\ntwo heuristic methods: (1) weighting equally, and (2) weighting by the amount\nof work completed by each. We prove convergence of the two methods under\nperfect consensus, assuming straggler statistics are independent and identical\nacross all workers for all iterations. Our numerical results show that under\napproximate consensus the second method outperforms the first method for both\nconvex and non-convex objective functions. We make use of the theory on minimum\nvariance unbiased estimator (MVUE) to evaluate the existence of an optimal\nmethod for combining worker outputs. While we conclude that neither of the two\nheuristic methods are optimal, we also show that an optimal method does not\nexist.",

However, most existing studies focus on building\na more complex neural network with a massive number of layers, bringing heavy\ncomputational cost and memory storage. Recently, as Transformer yields\nbrilliant results in NLP tasks, more and more researchers start to explore the\napplication of Transformer in computer vision tasks. But with the heavy\ncomputational cost and high GPU memory occupation of the vision Transformer,\nthe network can not be designed too deep. To address this problem, we propose a\nnovel Efficient Super-Resolution Transformer (ESRT) for fast and accurate image\nsuper-resolution. ESRT is a hybrid Transformer where a CNN-based SR network is\nfirst designed in the front to extract deep features. Specifically, there are\ntwo backbones for formatting the ESRT: lightweight CNN backbone (LCB) and\nlightweight Transformer backbone (LTB). Among them, LCB is a lightweight SR\nnetwork to extract deep SR features at a low computational cost by dynamically\nadjusting the size of the feature map. LTB is made up of an efficient\nTransformer (ET) with a small GPU memory occupation, which benefited from the\nnovel efficient multi-head attention (EMHA). In EMHA, a feature split module\n(FSM) is proposed to split the long sequence into sub-segments and then these\nsub-segments are applied by attention operation. This module can significantly\ndecrease the GPU memory occupation. Extensive experiments show that our ESRT\nachieves competitive results.

This article\npresents an approach to detect the failure occurring in drill machines based on\ndrill sounds from Valmet AB. The drill dataset includes three classes:\nanomalous sounds, normal sounds, and irrelevant sounds, which are also labeled\nas ``Broken\", ``Normal\", and ``Other\", respectively. Detecting drill failure\neffectively remains a challenge due to the following reasons. The waveform of\ndrill sound is complex and short for detection. Additionally, in realistic\nsoundscapes, there are sounds and noise in the context at the same time.\nMoreover, the balanced dataset is small to apply state-of-the-art deep learning\ntechniques. To overcome these aforementioned difficulties, we augmented sounds\nto increase the number of sounds in the dataset. We then proposed a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) combined with a long short-term memory\n(LSTM) to extract features from log-Mel spectrograms and learn global\nhigh-level feature representation for the classification of three classes. A\nleaky rectified linear unit (Leaky ReLU) was utilized as the activation\nfunction for our proposed CNN instead of the rectified linear unit (ReLU).\nMoreover, we deployed an attention mechanism at the frame level after the LSTM\nlayer to learn long-term global feature representations.

INVIGORATE embodies\nseveral challenges: (i) infer the target object among other occluding objects,\nfrom input language expressions and RGB images, (ii) infer object blocking\nrelationships (OBRs) from the images, and (iii) synthesize a multi-step plan to\nask questions that disambiguate the target object and to grasp it successfully.\nWe train separate neural networks for object detection, for visual grounding,\nfor question generation, and for OBR detection and grasping. They allow for\nunrestricted object categories and language expressions, subject to the\ntraining datasets.

    "abstract": "Most parallel applications suffer from load imbalance, a crucial performance\ndegradation factor. In particle simulations, this is mainly due to the\nmigration of particles between processing elements, which eventually gather\nunevenly and create workload imbalance. Dynamic load balancing is used at\nvarious iterations to mitigate load imbalance, employing a partitioning method\nto divide the computational space evenly while minimizing communications. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel partitioning methodology called ``informed\npartitioning''. It uses information based on the evolution of the computation\nto reduce the load balancing growth and the number of load balancing calls. We\nillustrate informed partitioning by proposing a new geometric partitioning\ntechnique for particles simulations. This technique is derived from the\nwell-known recursive coordinate bisection and employs the velocity of the\nparticles to guide the bisection axis. To properly compare the performance of\nour new method with existing partitioning techniques during application\nexecution, we introduce an effort metric based on a theoretical model of load\nbalanced parallel application time. We propose a proof-of-concept of informed\npartitioning, through a numerical study, on three N-Body simulations with\nvarious particle dynamics, and we discuss its performance against popular\ngeometric partitioning techniques. Moreover, we show that our effort metric can\nbe used to rank partitioning techniques by their efficiency at any time point\nduring the simulation. Eventually, this could be used to choose the best\npartitioning on the fly. In the numerical study, we report that our novel\nconcept increases the performance of two experiments out of three by up to 76%\nand 15%, while being marginally slower by only $3\\%$ in one experiment.

Given that traffic volume\nand the proportion of vehicles with different turning expectation may change\nwith time, fixed lane direction may lead to inefficiency at intersections. This\npaper proposes a multi-lane unsignalized intersection cooperation method that\nconsiders flexible lane direction. The two-dimensional distribution of vehicles\nis calculated and vehicles that are not in conflict are scheduled to pass the\nintersection simultaneously. The formation reconfiguration method is utilized\nto achieve collision-free longitudinal and lateral position adjustment of\nvehicles. Simulations are conducted at different input traffic volumes and\nturning proportion of incoming vehicles, and the results indicate that our\nmethod outperformances the fixed-lane-direction unsignalized cooperation method\nand the signalized method.",

    "abstract": "Today, Internet communication security has become more complex as technology\nbecomes faster and more efficient, especially for resource-limited devices such\nas embedded devices, wireless sensors, and radio frequency identification\n(RFID) tags, and Internet of Things (IoT). Lightweight encryption algorithms\nprovide security for these devices to protect data against intruders. But the\nlimitation of using energy in lightweight block ciphers (LBCs) is one of the\nmajor challenges for ever-expanding IoT technologies. Also, these LBC are\nsubject to Side-channel attacks, which are among the most cited threats to\nthese ciphers. In this paper, a differential power attack (DPA) to the Midori64\nblock cipher is designed. According to the proposed method, an attack on the\nS-boxes of the first round is done to obtain half of the master key bits. Then,\nthe S-boxes of the second round were attacked to obtain remaining the master\nkey bits. The results confirmed that the key is ultimately obtained. With the\nlow volume of computational complexity, we obtained the Midori block cipher\nkey, which was considered secure, just by using 300 samples of the plaintext.\nFollowing the running of Midori64 on the AVR microcontroller of the Atmega32\nmodel, the master key of Midori block cipher is discovered with 300 known\ntexts. Furthermore, we obtained the master key with a smaller number of samples\nthan the electromagnetic analysis attack.",

    "abstract": "Facial expression recognition (FER) has received increasing interest in\ncomputer vision. We propose the TransFER model which can learn rich\nrelation-aware local representations. It mainly consists of three components:\nMulti-Attention Dropping (MAD), ViT-FER, and Multi-head Self-Attention Dropping\n(MSAD). First, local patches play an important role in distinguishing various\nexpressions, however, few existing works can locate discriminative and diverse\nlocal patches. This can cause serious problems when some patches are invisible\ndue to pose variations or viewpoint changes. To address this issue, the MAD is\nproposed to randomly drop an attention map. Consequently, models are pushed to\nexplore diverse local patches adaptively. Second, to build rich relations\nbetween different local patches, the Vision Transformers (ViT) are used in FER,\ncalled ViT-FER. Since the global scope is used to reinforce each local patch, a\nbetter representation is obtained to boost the FER performance. Thirdly, the\nmulti-head self-attention allows ViT to jointly attend to features from\ndifferent information subspaces at different positions. Given no explicit\nguidance, however, multiple self-attentions may extract similar relations. To\naddress this, the MSAD is proposed to randomly drop one self-attention module.\nAs a result, models are forced to learn rich relations among diverse local\npatches. Our proposed TransFER model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods\non several FER benchmarks, showing its effectiveness and usefulness.",

Firstly, there are many specialized\njargons in the product description, which are ambiguous to translate without\nthe product image. Secondly, product descriptions are related to the image in\nmore complicated ways than standard image descriptions, involving various\nvisual aspects such as objects, shapes, colors or even subjective styles.\nMoreover, existing PMT datasets are small in scale to support the research. In\nthis paper, we first construct a large-scale bilingual product description\ndataset called Fashion-MMT, which contains over 114k noisy and 40k manually\ncleaned description translations with multiple product images. To effectively\nlearn semantic alignments among product images and bilingual texts in\ntranslation, we design a unified product-oriented cross-modal cross-lingual\nmodel (\\upoc~) for pre-training and fine-tuning. Experiments on the Fashion-MMT\nand Multi30k datasets show that our model significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models even pre-trained on the same dataset.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of joint massive devices separation and\nchannel estimation for a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided\nunsourced random access (URA) scheme in the sixth-generation (6G) wireless\nnetworks. In particular, by associating the data sequences to a rank-one tensor\nand exploiting the angular sparsity of the channel, the detection problem is\ncast as a high-order coupled tensor decomposition problem. However, the\ncoupling among multiple devices to RIS (device-RIS) channels together with\ntheir sparse structure make the problem intractable. By devising novel priors\nto incorporate problem structures, we design a novel probabilistic model to\ncapture both the element-wise sparsity from the angular channel model and the\nlow rank property due to the sporadic nature of URA. Based on the this\nprobabilistic model, we develop a coupled tensor-based automatic detection\n(CTAD) algorithm under the framework of variational inference with fast\nconvergence and low computational complexity. Moreover, the proposed algorithm\ncan automatically learn the number of active devices and thus effectively avoid\nnoise overfitting.

    "abstract": "Recently, the graph neural network (GNN) has shown great power in matrix\ncompletion by formulating a rating matrix as a bipartite graph and then\npredicting the link between the corresponding user and item nodes. The majority\nof GNN-based matrix completion methods are based on Graph Autoencoder (GAE),\nwhich considers the one-hot index as input, maps a user (or item) index to a\nlearnable embedding, applies a GNN to learn the node-specific representations\nbased on these learnable embeddings and finally aggregates the representations\nof the target users and its corresponding item nodes to predict missing links.\nHowever, without node content (i.e., side information) for training, the user\n(or item) specific representation can not be learned in the inductive setting,\nthat is, a model trained on one group of users (or items) cannot adapt to new\nusers (or items). To this end, we propose an inductive matrix completion method\nusing GAE (IMC-GAE), which utilizes the GAE to learn both the user-specific (or\nitem-specific) representation for personalized recommendation and local graph\npatterns for inductive matrix completion. Specifically, we design two\ninformative node features and employ a layer-wise node dropout scheme in GAE to\nlearn local graph patterns which can be generalized to unseen data. The main\ncontribution of our paper is the capability to efficiently learn local graph\npatterns in GAE, with good scalability and superior expressiveness compared to\nprevious GNN-based matrix completion methods.

In this work, we propose an approach\nfor incorporating the shape-aware 2D/3D constraints into the 3D detection\nframework. Specifically, we employ the deep neural network to learn\ndistinguished 2D keypoints in the 2D image domain and regress their\ncorresponding 3D coordinates in the local 3D object coordinate first. Then the\n2D/3D geometric constraints are built by these correspondences for each object\nto boost the detection performance. For generating the ground truth of 2D/3D\nkeypoints, an automatic model-fitting approach has been proposed by fitting the\ndeformed 3D object model and the object mask in the 2D image.

One requirement is a fundamental understanding of underlying\nconcepts, i.e., events that occur on the pitch. Previous work often deals only\nwith so-called low-level events based on well-defined rules such as free kicks,\nfree throws, or goals. High-level events, such as passes, are less frequently\napproached due to a lack of consistent definitions. This introduces a level of\nambiguity that necessities careful validation when regarding event annotations.\nYet, this validation step is usually neglected as the majority of studies adopt\nannotations from commercial providers on private datasets of unknown quality\nand focuses on soccer only. To address these issues, we present (1) a universal\ntaxonomy that covers a wide range of low and high-level events for invasion\ngames and is exemplarily refined to soccer and handball, and (2) release two\nmulti-modal datasets comprising video and positional data with gold-standard\nannotations to foster research in fine-grained and ball-centered event\nspotting. Experiments on human performance demonstrate the robustness of the\nproposed taxonomy, and that disagreements and ambiguities in the annotation\nincrease with the complexity of the event.

    "abstract": "One-class novelty detectors are trained with examples of a particular class\nand are tasked with identifying whether a query example belongs to the same\nknown class. Most recent advances adopt a deep auto-encoder style architecture\nto compute novelty scores for detecting novel class data. Deep networks have\nshown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet little focus is devoted to\nstudying the adversarial robustness of deep novelty detectors. In this paper,\nwe first show that existing novelty detectors are susceptible to adversarial\nexamples. We further demonstrate that commonly-used defense approaches for\nclassification tasks have limited effectiveness in one-class novelty detection.\nHence, we need a defense specifically designed for novelty detection. To this\nend, we propose a defense strategy that manipulates the latent space of novelty\ndetectors to improve the robustness against adversarial examples. The proposed\nmethod, referred to as Principal Latent Space (PLS), learns the\nincrementally-trained cascade principal components in the latent space to\nrobustify novelty detectors. PLS can purify latent space against adversarial\nexamples and constrain latent space to exclusively model the known class\ndistribution. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple attacks, datasets\nand novelty detectors, showing that PLS consistently enhances the adversarial\nrobustness of novelty detection models.",

    "abstract": "The trade-off between the quality and timeliness of adaptation is a\nmulti-faceted challenge in engineering self-adaptive systems. Obtaining\nadaptation plans that fulfill system objectives with high utility and in a\ntimely manner is the holy grail, however, as recent research revealed, it is\nnot trivial. Hybrid planning is concerned with resolving the time and quality\ntrade-off via dynamically combining multiple planners that individually aim to\nperform either timely or with high quality. The choice of the most fitting\nplanner is steered based on assessments of runtime information. A hybrid\nplanner for a self-adaptive system requires (i) a decision-making mechanism\nthat utilizes (ii) system-level as well as (iii) feedback control-level\ninformation at runtime.\nIn this paper, we present HYPEZON, a hybrid planner for self-adaptive\nsystems. Inspired by model predictive control, HYPEZON leverages receding\nhorizon control to utilize runtime information during its decision-making.\nMoreover, we propose to engineer HYPEZON for self-adaptive systems via two\nalternative designs that conform to meta-self-aware architectures.\nMeta-self-awareness allows for obtaining knowledge and reasoning about own\nawareness via adding a higher-level reasoning entity. HYPEZON aims to address\nthe problem of hybrid planning by considering it as a case for\nmeta-self-awareness.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel classification scheme for the remotely\nsensed hyperspectral image (HSI), namely SP-DLRR, by comprehensively exploring\nits unique characteristics, including the local spatial information and\nlow-rankness. SP-DLRR is mainly composed of two modules, i.e., the\nclassification-guided superpixel segmentation and the discriminative low-rank\nrepresentation, which are iteratively conducted. Specifically, by utilizing the\nlocal spatial information and incorporating the predictions from a typical\nclassifier, the first module segments pixels of an input HSI (or its\nrestoration generated by the second module) into superpixels. According to the\nresulting superpixels, the pixels of the input HSI are then grouped into\nclusters and fed into our novel discriminative low-rank representation model\nwith an effective numerical solution. Such a model is capable of increasing the\nintra-class similarity by suppressing the spectral variations locally while\npromoting the inter-class discriminability globally, leading to a restored HSI\nwith more discriminative pixels. Experimental results on three benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate the significant superiority of SP-DLRR over\nstate-of-the-art methods, especially for the case with an extremely limited\nnumber of training pixels.",

The considered method is Razumikhin for time-varying\ndelay large-scale systems, in which it includes a Lyapunov function associated\nwith the original non-augmented state space of system dynamics in comparison\nwith the Krasovskii method. As a rule, the Razumikhin method has a perfect\npotential to avoid the inherent complexity of the Krasovskii method especially\nin the presence of large delays and disturbances. The considered large-scale\nsystem in this manuscript is decomposed into several subsystems, each of which\nis represented by a fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) model and the interconnection\nbetween any two subsystems is considered. Because the main section of the model\npredictive control is optimization, the hierarchical scheme is performed for\nthe optimization problem. Furthermore, persistent disturbances are considered\nthat robust positive invariance and input-to-state stability under such\ncircumstances are studied. The linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) method is\nperformed for our computations. So the closed-loop large-scale system is\nasymptotically stable.

    "abstract": "The development of deep segmentation models for computational pathology\n(CPath) can help foster the investigation of interpretable morphological\nbiomarkers. Yet, there is a major bottleneck in the success of such approaches\nbecause supervised deep learning models require an abundance of accurately\nlabelled data. This issue is exacerbated in the field of CPath because the\ngeneration of detailed annotations usually demands the input of a pathologist\nto be able to distinguish between different tissue constructs and nuclei.\nManually labelling nuclei may not be a feasible approach for collecting\nlarge-scale annotated datasets, especially when a single image region can\ncontain thousands of different cells. However, solely relying on automatic\ngeneration of annotations will limit the accuracy and reliability of ground\ntruth. Therefore, to help overcome the above challenges, we propose a\nmulti-stage annotation pipeline to enable the collection of large-scale\ndatasets for histology image analysis, with pathologist-in-the-loop refinement\nsteps. Using this pipeline, we generate the largest known nuclear instance\nsegmentation and classification dataset, containing nearly half a million\nlabelled nuclei in H&E stained colon tissue.

    "abstract": "In this article, we explore the potential of transformer-based language\nmodels (LMs) to correctly represent normative statements in the legal domain,\ntaking tax law as our use case. In our experiment, we use a variety of LMs as\nbases for both word- and sentence-based clusterers that are then evaluated on a\nsmall, expert-compiled test-set, consisting of real-world samples from tax law\nresearch literature that can be clearly assigned to one of four normative\ntheories. The results of the experiment show that clusterers based on\nsentence-BERT-embeddings deliver the most promising results. Based on this main\nexperiment, we make first attempts at using the best performing models in a\nbootstrapping loop to build classifiers that map normative claims on one of\nthese four normative theories.",

    "abstract": "In order to properly train a machine learning model, data must be properly\ncollected.

For example,\nguaranteeing that the data set contains samples across the whole input space,\nor that the data set is balanced w.r.t. different classes. We present a formal\napproach for verifying a set of arbitrarily stated properties over a data set.\nThe proposed approach relies on the transformation of the data set into a first\norder logic formula, which can be later verified w.r.t. the different\nproperties also stated in the same logic. A prototype tool, which uses the z3\nsolver, has been developed; the prototype can take as an input a set of\nproperties stated in a formal language and formally verify a given data set\nw.r.t. to the given set of properties. Preliminary experimental results show\nthe feasibility and performance of the proposed approach, and furthermore the\nflexibility for expressing properties of interest.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic forced mankind to unprecedented global challenges,\ndrastically changing our way of living. To minimize life losses, multi-level\nstrategies requiring collective efforts were adopted, while waiting for\nresearchers and Pharma companies to develop vaccines. The management of so\ncomplex processes has partly taken benefit from a network vision and from the\nrising framework of the Internet of Things (IoT). Among the several\ntechnologies converging to IoT, the Radiofrequency Identification (RFID), based\non backscattering communication, is probably the approach that is most suitable\nto both the micro (the user) and the macro (the processes) scale. Accordingly,\na single infrastructure can support almost all the logistic and monitoring\nissues related to the war against a pandemic. Based on the earned COVID-19\nexperience, this paper is a guide about how state-of-the-art RFID systems can\nbe employed in facing future pandemic outbreaks. The three pillars of the\ncontrast are addressed, namely: 1) use and managing of Personal Protective\nEquipment (PPE), 2) access control and social distancing, and 3) early\ndetection of symptoms. For each class, the envisaged RFID devices and\nprocedures are identified and discussed based on the already available\ntechnology and on the state of the art of worldwide research. The presented\nguide tells us that this technology has a real potentiality to play a key role\nin generating an extraordinary amount of data, so that complementary paradigms\nof Edge Computing and Artificial intelligence should be tightly integrated to\nextract profiles and identify anomalous events, in compliance with privacy and\nsecurity.",

The former is a calculus with synchronous communication of\nprocesses, while the latter has synchronizing mutable locations - called locks\n- that behave similarly to binary semaphores. The criteria for correctness of\ntranslations is that they preserve and reflect may-termination and\nmust-termination of the processes.

    "abstract": "Serverless computing provides fine-grain resource sharing between Cloud\ntenants through containers. Each function invocation (action) runs in an\nindividual container. When there is not an already started container for a user\nfunction, a new container has to be created for it. However, the long cold\nstartup time of a container results in the long response latency of the action.\nOur investigation shows that the containers for some user actions share most of\nthe software packages. If an action that requires a new container can\n``borrow'' a similar warm container from other actions, the long cold startup\ncan be eliminated. Based on the above finding, we propose Pagurus, a runtime\ncontainer management system for eliminating the cold startup in serverless\ncomputing. Pagurus is comprised of an inter-action container scheduler and an\nintra-action container scheduler for each action. The inter-action container\nscheduler schedules shared containers among actions. The intra-action container\nscheduler deals with the management of the container lifecycle. Our\nexperimental results show that Pagurus effectively eliminates the\ntime-consuming container cold startup. An action may start to run in 10ms with\nPagurus, even if there is not warm container for it.",

    "abstract": "We propose a multiscale spatio-temporal graph neural network (MST-GNN) to\npredict the future 3D skeleton-based human poses in an action-category-agnostic\nmanner. The core of MST-GNN is a multiscale spatio-temporal graph that\nexplicitly models the relations in motions at various spatial and temporal\nscales. Different from many previous hierarchical structures, our multiscale\nspatio-temporal graph is built in a data-adaptive fashion, which captures\nnonphysical, yet motion-based relations. The key module of MST-GNN is a\nmultiscale spatio-temporal graph computational unit (MST-GCU) based on the\ntrainable graph structure. MST-GCU embeds underlying features at individual\nscales and then fuses features across scales to obtain a comprehensive\nrepresentation. The overall architecture of MST-GNN follows an encoder-decoder\nframework, where the encoder consists of a sequence of MST-GCUs to learn the\nspatial and temporal features of motions, and the decoder uses a graph-based\nattention gate recurrent unit (GA-GRU) to generate future poses. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted to show that the proposed MST-GNN outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in both short and long-term motion prediction on the\ndatasets of Human 3.6M, CMU Mocap and 3DPW, where MST-GNN outperforms previous\nworks by 5.33% and 3.67% of mean angle errors in average for short-term and\nlong-term prediction on Human 3.6M, and by 11.84% and 4.71% of mean angle\nerrors for short-term and long-term prediction on CMU Mocap, and by 1.13% of\nmean angle errors on 3DPW in average, respectively.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) has gained substantial interest in\nsemantic segmentation. However, almost all prior arts assume concurrent access\nto both labeled source and unlabeled target, making them unsuitable for\nscenarios demanding source-free adaptation. In this work, we enable source-free\nDA by partitioning the task into two: a) source-only domain generalization and\nb) source-free target adaptation. Towards the former, we provide theoretical\ninsights to develop a multi-head framework trained with a virtually extended\nmulti-source dataset, aiming to balance generalization and specificity. Towards\nthe latter, we utilize the multi-head framework to extract reliable target\npseudo-labels for self-training. Additionally, we introduce a novel conditional\nprior-enforcing auto-encoder that discourages spatial irregularities, thereby\nenhancing the pseudo-label quality. Experiments on the standard\nGTA5-to-Cityscapes and SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes benchmarks show our superiority\neven against the non-source-free prior-arts.

The experiment results show that our approach can achieve\nefficient and robust propulsion of the capsule with an average moving speed of\n$2.48 mm/s$ in the pig colon, and demonstrate the potential of using RRMA to\nenhance patient safety, reduce the inspection time, and improve the clinical\nacceptance of this technology.",

    "abstract": "Coflow scheduling improves data-intensive application performance by\nimproving their networking performance. State-of-the-art online coflow\nschedulers in essence approximate the classic Shortest-Job-First (SJF)\nscheduling by learning the coflow size online. In particular, they use multiple\npriority queues to simultaneously accomplish two goals: to sieve long coflows\nfrom short coflows, and to schedule short coflows with high priorities. Such a\nmechanism pays high overhead in learning the coflow size: moving a large coflow\nacross the queues delays small and other large coflows, and moving\nsimilar-sized coflows across the queues results in inadvertent round-robin\nscheduling. We propose Philae, a new online coflow scheduler that exploits the\nspatial dimension of coflows, i.e., a coflow has many flows, to drastically\nreduce the overhead of coflow size learning. Philae pre-schedules sampled flows\nof each coflow and uses their sizes to estimate the average flow size of the\ncoflow. It then resorts to Shortest Coflow First, where the notion of shortest\nis determined using the learned coflow sizes and coflow contention. We show\nthat the sampling-based learning is robust to flow size skew and has the added\nbenefit of much improved scalability from reduced coordinator-local agent\ninteractions. Our evaluation using an Azure testbed, a publicly available\nproduction cluster trace from Facebook shows that compared to the prior art\nAalo, Philae reduces the coflow completion time (CCT) in average (P90) cases by\n1.50x (8.00x) on a 150-node testbed and 2.72x (9.78x) on a 900-node testbed.\nEvaluation using additional traces further demonstrates Philae's robustness to\nflow size skew.",

We aim to develop a practical\ncomputational framework that is capable of capturing the mechanics of air blast\ncoupled to solids and structures that undergo large, inelastic deformations\nwith extreme damage and fragmentation. An immersed technique is used, which\ninvolves an a priori monolithic FSI formulation with the implicit detection of\nthe fluid-structure interface and without limitations on the solid domain\nmotion.

We feel\nthat the combination of these numerical tools is particularly attractive for\nthe problem class of interest due to the higher-order accuracy and smoothness\nof IGA and RKPM, the benefits of using immersed methodology in handling the\nfluid-structure coupling, and the capabilities of PD in simulating fracture and\nfragmentation scenarios.

Due to their many desired properties such as\ninterpolation, smoothness, short support and spline connections of basis\nfunctions, multivariate Hermite subdivision schemes employ fast numerical\nalgorithms for geometrically modeling curves/surfaces in CAGD and isogeometric\nanalysis, and for building Hermite wavelet methods in numerical PDEs and data\nsciences. In contrast to recent extensive study of univariate Hermite\nsubdivision schemes, multivariate Hermite subdivision schemes are barely\nanalyzed yet in the literature. In this paper we first introduce a notion of\ngeneralized Hermite subdivision schemes including all Hermite and other\nsubdivision schemes as special cases. Then we analyze and characterize\ngeneralized Hermite masks, convergence and smoothness of generalized Hermite\nsubdivision schemes with or without interpolation properties. We also introduce\nthe notion of linear-phase moments for generalized Hermite subdivision schemes\nto have the polynomial-interpolation property. We constructively prove that\nthere exist convergent smooth generalized Hermite subdivision schemes\n(including Hermite, Lagrange or Birkhoff subdivision schemes) with linear-phase\nmoments such that their basis vector functions are spline functions in $C^m$\nfor any given integer $m$ and have linearly independent integer shifts. Our\nresults not only extend and analyze many variants of Hermite subdivision\nschemes but also resolve and characterize as byproducts convergence and\nsmoothness of Hermite, Lagrange or Birkhoff subdivision schemes. Even in\ndimension one our results significantly generalize and extend many known\nresults on univariate Hermite subdivision schemes. Examples are provided to\nillustrate the theoretical results in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Slot filling is a fundamental task in dialog state tracking in task-oriented\ndialog systems. In multi-domain task-oriented dialog system, user utterances\nand system responses may mention multiple named entities and attributes values.\nA system needs to select those that are confirmed by the user and fill them\ninto destined slots. One difficulty is that since a dialogue session contains\nmultiple system-user turns, feeding in all the tokens into a deep model such as\nBERT can be challenging due to limited capacity of input word tokens and GPU\nmemory. In this paper, we investigate an ontology-enhanced approach by matching\nthe named entities occurred in all dialogue turns using ontology. The matched\nentities in the previous dialogue turns will be accumulated and encoded as\nadditional inputs to a BERT-based dialogue state tracker. In addition, our\nimprovement includes ontology constraint checking and the correction of slot\nname tokenization. Experimental results showed that our ontology-enhanced\ndialogue state tracker improves the joint goal accuracy (slot F1) from 52.63%\n(91.64%) to 53.91% (92%) on MultiWOZ 2.1 corpus.",

    "title": "Automatic Feature Highlighting in Noisy RES Data With CycleGAN",
    "abstract": "Radio echo sounding (RES) is a common technique used in subsurface glacial\nimaging, which provides insight into the underlying rock and ice. However,\nsystematic noise is introduced into the data during collection, complicating\ninterpretation of the results. Researchers most often use a combination of\nmanual interpretation and filtering techniques to denoise data; however, these\nprocesses are time intensive and inconsistent. Fully Convolutional Networks\nhave been proposed as an automated alternative to identify layer boundaries in\nradargrams. However, they require high-quality manually processed training data\nand struggle to interpolate data in noisy samples (Varshney et al. 2020).\nHerein, the authors propose a GAN based model to interpolate layer boundaries\nthrough noise and highlight layers in two-dimensional glacial RES data. In\nreal-world noisy images, filtering often results in loss of data such that\ninterpolating layer boundaries is nearly impossible. Furthermore, traditional\nmachine learning approaches are not suited to this task because of the lack of\npaired data, so we employ an unpaired image-to-image translation model. For\nthis model, we create a synthetic dataset to represent the domain of images\nwith clear, highlighted layers and use an existing real-world RES dataset as\nour noisy domain.\nWe implement a CycleGAN trained on these two domains to highlight layers in\nnoisy images that can interpolate effectively without significant loss of\nstructure or fidelity. Though the current implementation is not a perfect\nsolution, the model clearly highlights layers in noisy data and allows\nresearchers to determine layer size and position without mathematical\nfiltering, manual processing, or ground-truth images for training. This is\nsignificant because clean images generated by our model enable subsurface\nresearchers to determine glacial layer thickness more efficiently.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, single image dehazing models (SIDM) based on atmospheric\nscattering model (ASM) have achieved remarkable results. However, it is noted\nthat ASM-based SIDM degrades its performance in dehazing real world hazy images\ndue to the limited modelling ability of ASM where the atmospheric light factor\n(ALF) and the angular scattering coefficient (ASC) are assumed as constants for\none image. Obviously, the hazy images taken in real world cannot always satisfy\nthis assumption. Such generating modelling mismatch between the real-world\nimages and ASM sets up the upper bound of trained ASM-based SIDM for dehazing.\nBearing this in mind, in this study, a new fully non-homogeneous atmospheric\nscattering model (FNH-ASM) is proposed for well modeling the hazy images under\ncomplex conditions where ALF and ASC are pixel dependent. However, FNH-ASM\nbrings difficulty in practical application. In FNH-ASM based SIDM, the\nestimation bias of parameters at different positions lead to different\ndistortion of dehazing result. Hence, in order to reduce the influence of\nparameter estimation bias on dehazing results, two new cost sensitive loss\nfunctions, beta-Loss and D-Loss, are innovatively developed for limiting the\nparameter bias of sensitive positions that have a greater impact on the\ndehazing result. In the end, based on FNH-ASM, an end-to-end CNN-based dehazing\nnetwork, FNHD-Net, is developed, which applies beta-Loss and D-Loss.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our\nproposed FNHD-Net for dehazing on both synthetic and real-world images.

One of its ways of guaranteeing separation is the use of\nairborne, stand-alone Detect-And-Avoid, an operational concept where each\naircraft decides its avoidance maneuvers independently, observing right-of-way\nrules and, in specific implementations, some form of pairwise coordination.\nThis is a fundamental safety element for autonomous aircraft but, according to\nour research, is not sufficient for high-density airspaces as envisioned for\nurban environments. In these environments, some way of explicit and strategic\ntraffic coordination must be in place, as done for conventional ATM. For\nefficiency reasons, ATM is evolving to more flexible uses of the airspace, such\nthat the use of dynamically allocated corridors is a rising concept for AAM.\nThese strategic forms of traffic coordination are potentially highly efficient\nif the aircraft adhere to their trajectory contracts and there are no\nsignificant perturbations to the traffic. However, if significant perturbations\noccur, such as loss of data communication, or the sudden appearance of an\nintruder, a centralized system may not react appropriately in due time.

To cope\nwith the mitigation of planned service interruptions and to guarantee a\nseamless journey and a good travel experience for passengers, it is possible to\nexploit the existing services differently and/or provide additional on-demand\nservices, such as temporary supplemental bus lines. In this context, this paper\naims to develop a mathematical programming model for planning service\ninterruptions due to maintenance considering passenger transport demand\ndynamics. In particular, the proposed approach deals with service interruptions\ncharacterized by a long duration for which timetable adaption strategies are\nnot applicable, suggesting mitigation actions that exploit the already existing\nservices and/or the activation of additional ones, with the aim of minimizing\nusers' inconvenience. In doing so, the planned infrastructure status (i.e.,\navailable or under maintenance), as well as the forecasted transport demand,\nare taken into account to adapt the service accordingly by offering a\nmultimodal transport solution to passengers. To find the best solution, a\ndecomposition solution approach is proposed in combination with a multistage\ncooperative framework with feedback that models the negotiation process between\nthe involved actors. Finally, the applicability of the proposed approach to\nreal case studies is discussed based on some performance indicators.",

    "title": "Decentralized Air Traffic Management for Advanced Air Mobility",
    "abstract": "Leading proposals for Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) recognize the need for\nstrategic and tactical airspace deconfliction, where the need for coordination\nappears in different forms and nuances. One recurring element is the use of\npre-defined airways or corridors, a natural way to create order, with proven\nsuccess from the conventional, manned, Air Traffic Management (ATM). But, while\nATM is evolving to 4D Trajectory-Based Operations, when we apply the ATM\nprinciples to very dense and potentially more complex operations such as AAM,\nwe have to consider their limitations in such demanding new environment. The\nrequirement of following circulation corridors most often increase flight\ndistance and inevitably create bottlenecks, hence we explore the hypothesis of\nnot using corridors, testing such option via a simple and scalable simulation\nmodel. Other motivations for comparing different forms of traffic coordination\nare redundancy and diversity, which have potential to increase system safety.\nRelying on a single method to maintain traffic separation of course would not\nbe allowed in practice. However, the concepts that we have seen so far leave a\ngap between two very distinct and co-existing methods: one, cooperative and\ncentered on a ground-based Provider of Services for UAM (PSU), and another,\nwhich is mostly non-cooperative and independent, centered on the individual\naircraft, commonly referred to as Detect-And-Avoid (DAA). This duality achieves\na welcomed diversity, however presents several points for improvement.\nIn-between these opposite methods, this paper analyzes the performance of an\nairborne cooperative method to coordinate traffic which is capable of safely\nsolving conflicts of multiple aircraft (more than two) and achieve higher\nefficiency than DAA alone, thus with potential for being an alternative or a\nlive fallback for ground-based traffic coordination.",

    "title": "Lightweight Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) have greatly facilitated the development\nof sequential recommender systems by achieving state-of-the-art recommendation\nperformance on various sequential recommendation tasks. Given a sequence of\ninteracted items, existing DNN-based sequential recommenders commonly embed\neach item into a unique vector to support subsequent computations of the user\ninterest. However, due to the potentially large number of items, the\nover-parameterised item embedding matrix of a sequential recommender has become\na memory bottleneck for efficient deployment in resource-constrained\nenvironments, e.g., smartphones and other edge devices. Furthermore, we observe\nthat the widely-used multi-head self-attention, though being effective in\nmodelling sequential dependencies among items, heavily relies on redundant\nattention units to fully capture both global and local item-item transition\npatterns within a sequence.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel lightweight self-attentive network (LSAN)\nfor sequential recommendation. To aggressively compress the original embedding\nmatrix, LSAN leverages the notion of compositional embeddings, where each item\nembedding is composed by merging a group of selected base embedding vectors\nderived from substantially smaller embedding matrices. Meanwhile, to account\nfor the intrinsic dynamics of each item, we further propose a temporal\ncontext-aware embedding composition scheme. Besides, we develop an innovative\ntwin-attention network that alleviates the redundancy of the traditional\nmulti-head self-attention while retaining full capacity for capturing long- and\nshort-term (i.e., global and local) item dependencies. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that LSAN significantly advances the accuracy and\nmemory efficiency of existing sequential recommenders.",

    "abstract": "While deep learning has been very beneficial in data-rich settings, tasks\nwith smaller training set often resort to pre-training or multitask learning to\nleverage data from other tasks. In this case, careful consideration is needed\nto select tasks and model parameterizations such that updates from the\nauxiliary tasks actually help the primary task.

We investigate the effect of\ndifferent user-weighting strategies and different parameters on the performance\nof the joint IRS design and the resultant uplink-downlink trade-off regions. In\nall FDD scenarios and some TDD scenarios, the joint design significantly\noutperforms the heuristic of using the IRS configuration optimized for uplink\n(respectively, downlink) to assist the downlink (respectively, uplink)\ntransmissions and substantially bridges the gap to the upper bound of allowing\ndifferent IRS configurations in uplink and downlink.",

We evaluate the feature representations of the student\nmodel on 6 vision tasks including image recognition (classification, detection,\nsegmentation)and 3D geometry estimation (depth and surface normal estimation).\nMuST is scalable with unlabeled or partially labeled datasets and outperforms\nboth specialized supervised models and self-supervised models when training on\nlarge scale datasets.

However, it has been observed that compared with\n(stochastic) gradient descent, Adam can converge to a different solution with a\nsignificantly worse test error in many deep learning applications such as image\nclassification, even with a fine-tuned regularization. In this paper, we\nprovide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon: we show that in the\nnonconvex setting of learning over-parameterized two-layer convolutional neural\nnetworks starting from the same random initialization, for a class of data\ndistributions (inspired from image data), Adam and gradient descent (GD) can\nconverge to different global solutions of the training objective with provably\ndifferent generalization errors, even with weight decay regularization. In\ncontrast, we show that if the training objective is convex, and the weight\ndecay regularization is employed, any optimization algorithms including Adam\nand GD will converge to the same solution if the training is successful. This\nsuggests that the inferior generalization performance of Adam is fundamentally\ntied to the nonconvex landscape of deep learning optimization.",

    "title": "Optimizing embedding-related quantum annealing parameters for reducing  hardware bias",
    "abstract": "Quantum annealers have been designed to propose near-optimal solutions to\nNP-hard optimization problems. However, the accuracy of current annealers such\nas the ones of D-Wave Systems, Inc., is limited by environmental noise and\nhardware biases. One way to deal with these imperfections and to improve the\nquality of the annealing results is to apply a variety of pre-processing\ntechniques such as spin reversal (SR), anneal offsets (AO), or chain weights\n(CW). Maximizing the effectiveness of these techniques involves performing\noptimizations over a large number of parameters, which would be too costly if\nneeded to be done for each new problem instance. In this work, we show that the\naforementioned parameter optimization can be done for an entire class of\nproblems, given each instance uses a previously chosen fixed embedding.\nSpecifically, in the training phase, we fix an embedding E of a complete graph\nonto the hardware of the annealer, and then run an optimization algorithm to\ntune the following set of parameter values: the set of bits to be flipped for\nSR, the specific qubit offsets for AO, and the distribution of chain weights,\noptimized over a set of training graphs randomly chosen from that class, where\nthe graphs are embedded onto the hardware using E. In the testing phase, we\nestimate how well the parameters computed during the training phase work on a\nrandom selection of other graphs from that class. We investigate graph\ninstances of varying densities for the Maximum Clique, Maximum Cut, and Graph\nPartitioning problems. Our results indicate that, compared to their default\nbehavior, substantial improvements of the annealing results can be achieved by\nusing the optimized parameters for SR, AO, and CW.",

The established correction scheme does not translate to 7T since\nit requires a body coil reference. Here we introduce two alternatives that\noutperform the established method. Since they compute relative sensitivities\nthey do not require body coil images.\nTheory: The proposed methods use coil-combined magnitude images to obtain the\nrelative coil sensitivities. The first method efficiently computes the relative\nsensitivities via a simple ratio; the second by fitting a more sophisticated\ngenerative model.\nMethods: $R_1$ maps were computed using the variable flip angle (VFA)\napproach. Multiple datasets were acquired at 3T and 7T, with and without motion\nbetween the acquisition of the VFA volumes. $R_1$ maps were constructed without\ncorrection, with the proposed corrections, and (at 3T) with the previously\nestablished correction scheme.\nResults: At 3T, the proposed methods outperform the baseline method.\nInter-scan motion artefacts were also reduced at 7T. However, reproducibility\nonly converged on that of the no motion condition if position-specific transmit\nfield effects were also incorporated.\nConclusion: The proposed methods simplify inter-scan motion correction of\n$R_1$ maps and are applicable at both 3T and 7T, where a body coil is typically\nnot available.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing is an information processing paradigm that uses\nquantum-mechanical properties to speedup computationally hard problems.\nAlthough promising, existing gate-based quantum computers consist of only a few\ndozen qubits and are not large enough for most applications. On the other hand,\nexisting QAs with few thousand of qubits have the potential to solve some\ndomain-specific optimization problems. QAs are single instruction machines and\nto execute a program, the problem is cast to a Hamiltonian, embedded on the\nhardware, and a single quantum machine instruction (QMI) is run. Unfortunately,\nnoise and imperfections in hardware result in sub-optimal solutions on QAs even\nif the QMI is run for thousands of trials.\nThe limited programmability of QAs mean that the user executes the same QMI\nfor all trials. This subjects all trials to a similar noise profile throughout\nthe execution, resulting in a systematic bias. We observe that systematic bias\nleads to sub-optimal solutions and cannot be alleviated by executing more\ntrials or using existing error-mitigation schemes. To address this challenge,\nwe propose EQUAL (Ensemble Quantum Annealing). EQUAL generates an ensemble of\nQMIs by adding controlled perturbations to the program QMI. When executed on\nthe QA, the ensemble of QMIs steers the program away from encountering the same\nbias during all trials and thus, improves the quality of solutions. Our\nevaluations using the 2041-qubit D-Wave QA show that EQUAL bridges the\ndifference between the baseline and the ideal by an average of 14% (and up to\n26%), without requiring any additional trials. EQUAL can be combined with\nexisting error mitigation schemes to further bridge the difference between the\nbaseline and ideal by an average of 55% (and up to 68%).",

In this\nwork, we propose an implicit Neural Representation learning methodology with\nPrior embedding (NeRP) to reconstruct a computational image from sparsely\nsampled measurements. The method differs fundamentally from previous deep\nlearning-based image reconstruction approaches in that NeRP exploits the\ninternal information in an image prior, and the physics of the sparsely sampled\nmeasurements to produce a representation of the unknown subject. No large-scale\ndata is required to train the NeRP except for a prior image and sparsely\nsampled measurements.

    "title": "Layer Adaptive Node Selection in Bayesian Neural Networks: Statistical  Guarantees and Implementation Details",
    "abstract": "Sparse deep neural networks have proven to be efficient for predictive model\nbuilding in large-scale studies. Although several works have studied\ntheoretical and numerical properties of sparse neural architectures, they have\nprimarily focused on the edge selection. Sparsity through edge selection might\nbe intuitively appealing; however, it does not necessarily reduce the\nstructural complexity of a network. Instead pruning excessive nodes in each\nlayer leads to a structurally sparse network which would have lower\ncomputational complexity and memory footprint. We propose a Bayesian sparse\nsolution using spike-and-slab Gaussian priors to allow for node selection\nduring training. The use of spike-and-slab prior alleviates the need of an\nad-hoc thresholding rule for pruning redundant nodes from a network. In\naddition, we adopt a variational Bayes approach to circumvent the computational\nchallenges of traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementation. In\nthe context of node selection, we establish the fundamental result of\nvariational posterior consistency together with the characterization of prior\nparameters. In contrast to the previous works, our theoretical development\nrelaxes the assumptions of the equal number of nodes and uniform bounds on all\nnetwork weights, thereby accommodating sparse networks with layer-dependent\nnode structures or coefficient bounds. With a layer-wise characterization of\nprior inclusion probabilities, we also discuss optimal contraction rates of the\nvariational posterior. Finally, we provide empirical evidence to substantiate\nthat our theoretical work facilitates layer-wise optimal node recovery together\nwith competitive predictive performance.",

A QKD-aware\ncentralised SDN controller is utilised to provide dynamicity in switching and\nrerouting. The feasibility of coexisting a quantum channel with carrier-grade\nclassical optical channels over field-deployed and laboratory-based fibres is\nexperimentally explored in terms of achievable quantum bit error rate, secret\nkey rate as well as classical signal bit error rate. Moreover, coexistence\nanalysis over multi-hops configuration using different switching scenarios is\nalso presented. The secret key rate dropped 43 % when coexisting one classical\nchannel with 150 GHz spacing from the quantum channel for multiple links. This\nis due to the noise leakage from the Raman scattering into the 100 GHz\nbandwidth of the internal filter of the Bob DV-QKD unit. When coexisting four\nclassical channels with 150 GHz spacing between quantum and the nearest\nclassical channel, the quantum channel deteriorates faster due to the\ncombination of Raman noise, other nonlinearities and high aggregated launch\npower causing the QBER value to exceed the threshold of 6 % leading the SKR to\nreach a value of zero bps at a launch power of 7 dB per channel. Furthermore,\nthe coexistence of a quantum channel and six classical channels through a\nfield-deployed fibre Test Network is examined.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based techniques for automatic dysarthric speech detection have\nrecently attracted interest in the research community. State-of-the-art\ntechniques typically learn neurotypical and dysarthric discriminative\nrepresentations by processing time-frequency input representations such as the\nmagnitude spectrum of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Although these\ntechniques are expected to leverage perceptual dysarthric cues, representations\nsuch as the magnitude spectrum of the STFT do not necessarily convey perceptual\naspects of complex sounds. Inspired by the temporal processing mechanisms of\nthe human auditory system, in this paper we factor signals into the product of\na slowly varying envelope and a rapidly varying fine structure. Separately\nexploiting the different perceptual cues present in the envelope (i.e.,\nphonetic information, stress, and voicing) and fine structure (i.e., pitch,\nvowel quality, and breathiness), two discriminative representations are learned\nthrough a convolutional neural network and used for automatic dysarthric speech\ndetection. Experimental results show that processing both the envelope and fine\nstructure representations yields a considerably better dysarthric speech\ndetection performance than processing only the envelope, fine structure, or\nmagnitude spectrum of the STFT representation.",

    "abstract": "The interpretation of unlabeled acoustic emission (AE) data classically\nrelies on general-purpose clustering methods. While several external criteria\nhave been used in the past to select the hyperparameters of those algorithms,\nfew studies have paid attention to the development of dedicated objective\nfunctions in clustering methods able to cope with the specificities of AE data.\nWe investigate how to explicitly represent clusters onsets in mixture models in\ngeneral, and in Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) in particular. By modifying the\ninternal criterion of such models, we propose the first clustering method able\nto provide, through parameters estimated by an expectation-maximization\nprocedure, information about when clusters occur (onsets), how they grow\n(kinetics) and their level of activation through time. This new objective\nfunction accommodates continuous timestamps of AE signals and, thus, their\norder of occurrence. The method, called GMMSEQ, is experimentally validated to\ncharacterize the loosening phenomenon in bolted structure under vibrations. A\ncomparison with three standard clustering methods on raw streaming data from\nfive experimental campaigns shows that GMMSEQ not only provides useful\nqualitative information about the timeline of clusters, but also shows better\nperformance in terms of cluster characterization. In view of developing an open\nacoustic emission initiative and according to the FAIR principles, the datasets\nand the codes are made available to reproduce the research of this paper.",

The\nslab burner experiment is designed to verify mechanistic models of reacting\nboundary layer combustion in hybrid rockets by the measurement of fuel\nregression rates. A DSLR camera with a high intensity flash is used to capture\nimages throughout the burn and the images are then used to find the fuel\nboundary to calculate the regression rate. A U-net convolutional neural network\narchitecture is explored to segment the fuel from the experimental images. A\nMonte-Carlo Dropout process is used to quantify the regression rate uncertainty\nproduced from the network. The U-net computed regression rates are compared\nwith values from other techniques from literature and show error less than 10%.\nAn oxidizer flux dependency study is performed and shows the U-net predictions\nof regression rates are accurate and independent of the oxidizer flux, when the\nimages in the training set are not over-saturated. Training with monochrome\nimages is explored and is not successful at predicting the fuel regression rate\nfrom images with high noise. The network is superior at filtering out noise\nintroduced by soot, pitting, and wax deposition on the chamber glass as well as\nthe flame when compared to traditional image processing techniques, such as\nthreshold binary conversion and spatial filtering. U-net consistently provides\nlow error image segmentations to allow accurate computation of the regression\nrate of the fuel.",

Straus in 1956. In this paper we answer this question\nby showing that for each set $A$ consisting of positive integers\n$1<a_1<a_2<\\cdots <a_k$ and a $k$-term partition $P: n_1+n_2 + \\cdots + n_k=n$,\nthere exists a unique (up to reversal) cyclic word $x$ which maximizes (resp.\nminimizes) the regular cyclic continuant $K^{\\circlearrowright}(\\cdot)$ amongst\nall cyclic words over $A$ with Parikh vector $(n_1,n_2,\\ldots,n_k)$. We also\nshow that the same is true for the minimizing arrangement for the semi-regular\ncyclic continuant $\\dot K^{\\circlearrowright}(\\cdot)$. As in the non-cyclic\ncase, the main difficulty is to find the maximizing arrangement for the\nsemi-regular continuant, which is not unique in general and may depend on the\nintegers $a_1,\\ldots,a_k$ and not just on their relative order. We show that if\na cyclic word $x$ maximizes $\\dot K^{\\circlearrowright}(\\cdot)$ amongst all\npermutations of $x$, then it verifies a strong combinatorial condition which we\ncall the singular property.

    "abstract": "In recent years a lot of research has been conducted within the area of\ncausal inference and causal learning. Many methods have been developed to\nidentify the cause-effect pairs in models and have been successfully applied to\nobservational real-world data in order to determine the direction of causal\nrelationships. Many of these methods require simplifying assumptions, such as\nabsence of confounding, cycles, and selection bias. Yet in bivariate situations\ncausal discovery problems remain challenging. One class of such methods, that\nalso allows tackling the bivariate case, is based on Additive Noise Models\n(ANMs). Unfortunately, one aspect of these methods has not received much\nattention until now: what is the impact of different noise levels on the\nability of these methods to identify the direction of the causal relationship.\nThis work aims to bridge this gap with the help of an empirical study. For this\nwork, we considered bivariate cases, which is the most elementary form of a\ncausal discovery problem where one needs to decide whether X causes Y or Y\ncauses X, given joint distributions of two variables X, Y. Furthermore, two\nspecific methods have been selected, \\textit{Regression with Subsequent\nIndependence Test} and \\textit{Identification using Conditional Variances},\nwhich have been tested with an exhaustive range of ANMs where the additive\nnoises' levels gradually change from 1% to 10000% of the causes' noise level\n(the latter remains fixed). Additionally, the experiments in this work consider\nseveral different types of distributions as well as linear and non-linear ANMs.\nThe results of the experiments show that these methods can fail to capture the\ntrue causal direction for some levels of noise.",

The US Census Bureau's well-known ROAM\napplication uses principled statistical models trained on the US Census\nPlanning Database data to identify hard-to-survey areas. An earlier\ncrowdsourcing competition revealed that an ensemble of regression trees led to\nthe best performance in predicting survey response rates; however, the\ncorresponding models could not be adopted for the intended application due to\nlimited interpretability. In this paper, we present new interpretable\nstatistical methods to predict, with high accuracy, response rates in surveys.\nWe study sparse nonparametric additive models with pairwise interactions via\n$\\ell_0$-regularization, as well as hierarchically structured variants that\nprovide enhanced interpretability. Despite strong methodological underpinnings,\nsuch models can be computationally challenging -- we present new scalable\nalgorithms for learning these models. We also establish novel non-asymptotic\nerror bounds for the proposed estimators. Experiments based on the US Census\nPlanning Database demonstrate that our methods lead to high-quality predictive\nmodels that permit actionable interpretability for different segments of the\npopulation.
