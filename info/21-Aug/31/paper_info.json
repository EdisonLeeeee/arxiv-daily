    "abstract": "In this paper we outline a proposal for improving the governance of\nartificial intelligence (AI) by investing in government capacity to\nsystematically measure and monitor the capabilities and impacts of AI systems.\nIf adopted, this would give governments greater information about the AI\necosystem, equipping them to more effectively direct AI development and\ndeployment in the most societally and economically beneficial directions. It\nwould also create infrastructure that could rapidly identify potential threats\nor harms that could occur as a consequence of changes in the AI ecosystem, such\nas the emergence of strategically transformative capabilities, or the\ndeployment of harmful systems.\nWe begin by outlining the problem which motivates this proposal: in brief,\ntraditional governance approaches struggle to keep pace with the speed of\nprogress in AI. We then present our proposal for addressing this problem:\ngovernments must invest in measurement and monitoring infrastructure. We\ndiscuss this proposal in detail, outlining what specific things governments\ncould focus on measuring and monitoring, and the kinds of benefits this would\ngenerate for policymaking. Finally, we outline some potential pilot projects\nand some considerations for implementing this in practice.",

    "abstract": "The design of many-core neuromorphic hardware is getting more and more\ncomplex as these systems are expected to execute large machine learning models.\nTo deal with the design complexity, a predictable design flow is needed to\nguarantee real-time performance such as latency and throughput without\nsignificantly increasing the buffer requirement of computing cores. Synchronous\nData Flow Graphs (SDFGs) are used for predictable mapping of streaming\napplications to multiprocessor systems. We propose an SDFG-based design flow\nfor mapping spiking neural networks (SNNs) to many-core neuromorphic hardware\nwith the objective of exploring the tradeoff between throughput and buffer\nsize. The proposed design flow integrates an iterative partitioning approach,\nbased on Kernighan-Lin graph partitioning heuristic, creating SNN clusters such\nthat each cluster can be mapped to a core of the hardware. The partitioning\napproach minimizes the inter-cluster spike communication, which improves\nlatency on the shared interconnect of the hardware. Next, the design flow maps\nclusters to cores using an instance of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO),\nan evolutionary algorithm, exploring the design space of throughput and buffer\nsize. Pareto optimal mappings are retained from the design flow, allowing\nsystem designers to select a Pareto mapping that satisfies throughput and\nbuffer size requirements of the design. We evaluated the design flow using five\nlarge-scale convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Results demonstrate 63%\nhigher maximum throughput and 10% lower buffer size requirement compared to\nstate-of-the-art dataflow-based mapping solutions.",

    "abstract": "The commonly used latent space embedding techniques, such as Principal\nComponent Analysis, Factor Analysis, and manifold learning techniques, are\ntypically used for learning effective representations of homogeneous data.\nHowever, they do not readily extend to heterogeneous data that are a\ncombination of numerical and categorical variables, e.g., arising from linked\nGPS and text data. In this paper, we are interested in learning probabilistic\ngenerative models from high-dimensional heterogeneous data in an unsupervised\nfashion. The learned generative model provides latent unified representations\nthat capture the factors common to the multiple dimensions of the data, and\nthus enable fusing multimodal data for various machine learning tasks.\nFollowing a Bayesian approach, we propose a general framework that combines\ndisparate data types through the natural parameterization of the exponential\nfamily of distributions. To scale the model inference to millions of instances\nwith thousands of features, we use the Laplace-Bernstein approximation for\nposterior computations involving nonlinear link functions. The proposed\nalgorithm is presented in detail for the commonly encountered heterogeneous\ndatasets with real-valued (Gaussian) and categorical (multinomial) features.\nExperiments on two high-dimensional and heterogeneous datasets (NYC Taxi and\nMovieLens-10M) demonstrate the scalability and competitive performance of the\nproposed algorithm on different machine learning tasks such as anomaly\ndetection, data imputation, and recommender systems.",

    "abstract": "A trajectory, defined as a sequence of location measurements, contains\nvaluable information about movements of an individual. Its value of information\n(VOI) may change depending on the specific application. However, in a variety\nof applications, knowing the intrinsic VOI of a trajectory is important to\nguide other subsequent tasks or decisions. This work aims to find a principled\nframework to quantify the intrinsic VOI of trajectories from the owner's\nperspective. This is a challenging problem because an appropriate framework\nneeds to take into account various characteristics of the trajectory, prior\nknowledge, and different types of trajectory degradation. We propose a\nframework based on information gain (IG) as a principled approach to solve this\nproblem. Our IG framework transforms a trajectory with discrete-time\nmeasurements to a canonical representation, i.e., continuous in time with\ncontinuous mean and variance estimates, and then quantifies the reduction of\nuncertainty about the locations of the owner over a period of time as the VOI\nof the trajectory. Qualitative and extensive quantitative evaluation show that\nthe IG framework is capable of effectively capturing important characteristics\ncontributing to the VOI of trajectories.",

    "abstract": "A body of work has been done to automate machine learning algorithm to\nhighlight the importance of model choice. Automating the process of choosing\nthe best forecasting model and its corresponding parameters can result to\nimprove a wide range of real-world applications. Bayesian optimisation (BO)\nuses a blackbox optimisation methods to propose solutions according to an\nexploration-exploitation trade-off criterion through acquisition functions. BO\nframework imposes two key ingredients: a probabilistic surrogate model that\nconsist of prior belief of the unknown objective function(data-dependant) and\nan objective function that describes how optimal is the model-fit. Choosing the\nbest model and its associated hyperparameters can be very expensive, and is\ntypically fit using Gaussian processes (GPs) and at some extends applying\napproximate inference due its intractability. However, since GPs scale\ncubically with the number of observations, it has been challenging to handle\nobjectives whose optimization requires many evaluations.

The necessity to solve the analytical tractability and the\ncomputational feasibility in a stochastic fashion enables to ensure the\nefficiency and the applicability of Bayesian optimisation.

However, developers rarely work from clean checkouts. Instead, they\nrebuild software repeatedly, sometimes hundreds of times a day. To keep\nrebuilds fast, build systems run incrementally, executing commands only when\nbuilt state cannot be reused. Existing tools like make present users with a\ntradeoff. Simple build specifications are easy to write, but limit incremental\nwork. More complex build specifications produce faster incremental builds, but\nwriting them is labor-intensive and error-prone. This work shows that no such\ntradeoff is necessary; build specifications can be both simple and fast.\nWe introduce LaForge, a novel build tool that eliminates the need to specify\ndependencies or incremental build steps. LaForge builds are easy to specify;\ndevelopers write a simple script that runs a full build. Even a single command\nlike gcc src/*.c will suffice. LaForge traces the execution of the build and\ngenerates a transcript in the TraceIR language. On later builds, LaForge\nevaluates the TraceIR transcript to detect changes and perform an efficient\nincremental rebuild that automatically captures all build dependencies.\nWe evaluate LaForge by building 14 software packages, including LLVM and\nmemcached. Our results show that LaForge automatically generates efficient\nbuilds from simple build specifications. Full builds with LaForge have a median\noverhead of 16.1% compared to a project's default full build.

Graphs present a natural and intuitive way to model deep-learning\nnetworks where each node represents a computational stage or operation.\nIncorporating the inherent graph structure of these workloads in the\nperformance model can enable a better representation and learning of\ninter-stage interactions. The accuracy of a performance model has direct\nimplications on the efficiency of the search strategy, making it a crucial\ncomponent of this class of deep-learning compilers. In this work, we develop a\nnovel performance model that adopts a graph representation. In our model, each\nstage of computation represents a node characterized by features that capture\nthe operations performed by the stage. The interaction between nodes is\nachieved using graph convolutions. Experimental evaluation shows a 7:75x and\n12x reduction in prediction error compared to the Halide and TVM models,\nrespectively.",

Prior work has partially explained transferability by recognizing\ncommon adversarial subspaces and correlations between decision boundaries, but\nwe have found little explanation in the literature beyond this. In this paper,\nwe propose that transferability between seemingly different models is due to a\nhigh linear correlation between features that different deep neural networks\nextract. In other words, two models trained on the same task that are seemingly\ndistant in the parameter space likely extract features in the same fashion,\njust with trivial shifts and rotations between the latent spaces. Furthermore,\nwe show how applying a feature correlation loss, which decorrelates the\nextracted features in a latent space, can drastically reduce the\ntransferability of adversarial attacks between models, suggesting that the\nmodels complete tasks in semantically different ways. Finally, we propose a\nDual Neck Autoencoder (DNA), which leverages this feature correlation loss to\ncreate two meaningfully different encodings of input information with reduced\ntransferability.",

In this study, we provide reliable, fully computable, and locally\nspace-time efficient a posteriori error bounds for numerical approximations of\nthe fully degenerate Richards equation. For showing global reliability, a\nnonlocal-in-time error estimate is derived individually for the time-integrated\n$H^1(H^{-1})$, $L^2(L^2)$, and the $L^2(H^1)$ errors. A maximum principle and a\ndegeneracy estimator are employed for the last one. Global and local space-time\nefficiency error bounds are then obtained in a standard $H^1(H^{-1})\\cap\nL^2(H^1)$ norm. The reliability and efficiency norms employed coincide when\nthere is no nonlinearity.

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for openness, flexibility, and monetization the\nNetwork Function Virtualization (NFV) of mobile network functions has become\nthe embracing factor for most mobile network operators. Early reported field\ndeployments of virtualized Evolved Packet Core (EPC) - the core network\ncomponent of 4G LTE and 5G non-standalone mobile networks - reflect this\ngrowing trend. To best meet the requirements of power management, load\nbalancing, and fault tolerance in the cloud environment, the need for live\nmigration for these virtualized components cannot be shunned. Virtualization\nplatforms of interest include both Virtual Machines (VMs) and Containers, with\nthe latter option offering more lightweight characteristics. The first\ncontribution of this paper is the implementation of a number of custom\nfunctions that enable migration of Containers supporting virtualized EPC\ncomponents. The current CRIU-based migration of Docker Container does not fully\nsupport the mobile network protocol stack. CRIU extensions to support the\nmobile network protocol stack are therefore required and described in the\npaper. The second contribution is an experimental-based comprehensive analysis\nof live migration in two backhaul network settings and two virtualization\ntechnologies. The two backhaul network settings are the one provided by\nCloudLab and one based on a programmable optical network testbed that makes use\nof OpenROADM dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) equipment. The paper\ncompares the migration performance of the proposed implementation of\nOpenAirInterface (OAI) based containerized EPC components with the one\nutilizing VMs, running in OpenStack.

    "abstract": "Machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance on many\nsupervised learning tasks.

Such models cannot be trusted in deployment\nenvironments to provide accurate predictions. While viewing the problem from a\ncausal lens is known to be useful, the seamless integration of causation\ntechniques into machine learning pipelines remains cumbersome and expensive. In\nthis work, we study and extend a causal pre-training debiasing technique called\ncausal bootstrapping (CB) under five practical confounded-data\ngeneration-acquisition scenarios (with known and unknown confounding). Under\nthese settings, we systematically investigate the effect of confounding bias on\ndeep learning model performance, demonstrating their propensity to rely on\nshortcut biases when these biases are not properly accounted for. We\ndemonstrate that such a causal pre-training technique can significantly\noutperform existing base practices to mitigate confounding bias on real-world\ndomain generalization benchmarking tasks. This systematic investigation\nunderlines the importance of accounting for the underlying data-generating\nmechanisms and fortifying data-preprocessing pipelines with a causal framework\nto develop methods robust to confounding biases.",

However, client developers\ncan have issues identifying the correct usage of a certain API, causing misuses\naccompanied by software crashes or usability bugs. Therefore, researchers have\naimed at identifying API misuses automatically by comparing client code usages\nto correct API usages. Some techniques rely on certain API-specific graph-based\ndata structures to improve the abstract representation of API usages. Such\ntechniques need to compare graphs, for instance, by computing distance metrics\nbased on the minimal graph edit distance or the largest common subgraphs, whose\ncomputations are known to be NP-hard problems. Fortunately, there exist many\nabstractions for simplifying graph distance computation. However, their\napplicability for comparing graph representations of API usages has not been\nanalyzed. In this paper, we provide a comparison of different distance\nalgorithms of API-usage graphs regarding correctness and runtime.

For this purpose, we systematically identified a set of\neight graph-based distance algorithms and applied them on two datasets of\nreal-world API usages and misuses.

Then, we\npropose a method in which we train a neural network to do argmax inference\nunder a structured energy function, referring to the trained networks as\n\"inference networks\" or \"energy-based inference networks\". We then develop ways\nof jointly learning energy functions and inference networks using an\nadversarial learning framework. Despite the inference and learning difficulties\nof energy-based models, we present approaches in this thesis that enable\nenergy-based models more easily to be applied in structured NLP applications.",

    "title": "Designing for Multiple Centers of Power: A Taxonomy of Multi-level  Governance in Online Social Platforms",
    "abstract": "As online social platforms increasingly impact society, scholars and\nactivists have criticized the centralized and unaccountable nature of many of\ntheir governance structures. In response, some have proposed governance that\ncan represent a broader range of stakeholders through the creation of multiple\ncenters of power, with nested communities governed by customized rules set by\nlocal community managers. However, this multi-level governance structure, where\ninputs can come from both a centralized and a decentralized governance system,\nalready has implementations on many platforms, including Reddit, YouTube, and\nTwitter, albeit in very different forms. In this work, we characterize the\nlandscape of different multi-level governance structures in online social\nplatforms, drawing from extensive literature on taxonomies of multi-level\noffline institutions, including administrative hierarchy, federalism, and\npolycentricity. Focusing on the middle levels that sit between end users and a\ncentralized governance system, we describe how middle level units, such as\nsubreddits, YouTube channels, and Twitter blocklists, interact with one another\nand with levels above and below. As not all aspects of offline institutions\ntranslate directly to the online realm, we discuss challenges unique to online\ngovernance and lay out a research agenda for the future study of multi-level\ngovernance design in online social platforms.",

    "title": "Combining chest X-rays and EHR data using machine learning to diagnose  acute respiratory failure",
    "abstract": "When patients develop acute respiratory failure, accurately identifying the\nunderlying etiology is essential for determining the best treatment, but it can\nbe challenging to differentiate between common diagnoses in clinical practice.\nMachine learning models could improve medical diagnosis by augmenting clinical\ndecision making and play a role in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with\nacute respiratory failure. While machine learning models have been developed to\nidentify common findings on chest radiographs (e.g. pneumonia), augmenting\nthese approaches by also analyzing clinically relevant data from the electronic\nhealth record (EHR) could aid in the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure.\nMachine learning models were trained to predict the cause of acute respiratory\nfailure (pneumonia, heart failure, and/or COPD) using chest radiographs and EHR\ndata from patients within an internal cohort using diagnoses based on physician\nchart review. Models were also tested on patients in an external cohort using\ndischarge diagnosis codes. A model combining chest radiographs and EHR data\noutperformed models based on each modality alone for pneumonia and COPD. For\npneumonia, the combined model AUROC was 0.79 (0.78-0.79), image model AUROC was\n0.73 (0.72-0.75), and EHR model AUROC was 0.73 (0.70-0.76); for COPD, combined:\n0.89 (0.83-0.91), image: 0.85 (0.77-0.89), and EHR: 0.80 (0.76-0.84); for heart\nfailure, combined: 0.80 (0.77-0.84), image: 0.77 (0.71-0.81), and EHR: 0.80\n(0.75-0.82). In the external cohort, performance was consistent for heart\nfailure and COPD, but declined slightly for pneumonia. Overall, machine\nlearning models combing chest radiographs and EHR data can accurately\ndifferentiate between common causes of acute respiratory failure. Further work\nis needed to determine whether these models could aid clinicians in the\ndiagnosis of acute respiratory failure in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Training deep networks for semantic segmentation requires large amounts of\nlabeled training data, which presents a major challenge in practice, as\nlabeling segmentation masks is a highly labor-intensive process. To address\nthis issue, we present a framework for semi-supervised and domain-adaptive\nsemantic segmentation, which is enhanced by self-supervised monocular depth\nestimation (SDE) trained only on unlabeled image sequences.\nIn particular, we utilize SDE as an auxiliary task comprehensively across the\nentire learning framework: First, we automatically select the most useful\nsamples to be annotated for semantic segmentation based on the correlation of\nsample diversity and difficulty between SDE and semantic segmentation. Second,\nwe implement a strong data augmentation by mixing images and labels using the\ngeometry of the scene. Third, we transfer knowledge from features learned\nduring SDE to semantic segmentation by means of transfer and multi-task\nlearning. And fourth, we exploit additional labeled synthetic data with\nCross-Domain DepthMix and Matching Geometry Sampling to align synthetic and\nreal data.\nWe validate the proposed model on the Cityscapes dataset, where all four\ncontributions demonstrate significant performance gains, and achieve\nstate-of-the-art results for semi-supervised semantic segmentation as well as\nfor semi-supervised domain adaptation. In particular, with only 1/30 of the\nCityscapes labels, our method achieves 92% of the fully-supervised baseline\nperformance and even 97% when exploiting additional data from GTA.

In\nrecent years, fault diagnosis methods based on the Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have been mature, but Transformer has\nnot been widely used in the field of fault diagnosis. To address these\ndeficiencies, a new method based on the Time Series Transformer (TST) is\nproposed to recognize the fault mode of bearings. In this paper, our\ncontributions include: Firstly, we designed a tokens sequences generation\nmethod which can handle data in 1D format, namely time series tokenizer. Then,\nthe TST combining time series tokenizer and Transformer was introduced.\nFurthermore, the test results on the given dataset show that the proposed\nmethod has better fault identification capability than the traditional CNN and\nRNN models. Secondly, through the experiments, the effect of structural\nhyperparameters such as subsequence length and embedding dimension on fault\ndiagnosis performance, computational complexity and parameters number of the\nTST is analyzed in detail. The influence laws of some hyperparameters are\nobtained. Finally, via t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)\ndimensionality reduction method, the feature vectors in the embedding space are\nvisualized. On this basis, the working pattern of TST has been explained to a\ncertain extent. Moreover, by analyzing the distribution form of the feature\nvectors, we find that compared with the traditional CNN and RNN models, the\nfeature vectors extracted by the method in this paper show the best intra-class\ncompactness and inter-class separability.

Irrespective of the structure of\nthe error correcting code, GRAND tries to guess the noise that corrupted the\ncodeword in order to decode any linear error-correcting block code. GRAND\nMarkov Order (GRAND-MO) is a variant of GRAND that is useful to decode error\ncorrecting code transmitted over communication channels with memory which are\nvulnerable to burst noise. Usually, interleavers and de-interleavers are used\nin communication systems to mitigate the effects of channel memory.\nInterleaving and de-interleaving introduce undesirable latency, which increases\nwith channel memory.

In parallel, the Internet censorship\nliterature is replete with efforts to measure and overcome online censorship.\nHowever, in the course of designing specialized open-source platforms and\ntools, projects generally neglect the needs of supportive but uninvolved\n`average' users. In this paper, we propose a pluralistic approach to\ndemocratizing online discourse that considers both the systems-related and\nuser-facing issues as first-order design goals.",

Much work has focused on designing\nmodels for image classification, video classification, object detection, pose\nestimation, speech recognition, etc., and has achieved significant progress in\nrecent years thanks to deep learning. However, understanding the world is not\nenough. An AI agent also needs to know how to talk, especially how to\ncommunicate with a human. While perception (vision, for example) is more common\nacross animal species, the use of complicated language is unique to humans and\nis one of the most important aspects of intelligence.\nIn this thesis, we focus on generating textual output given visual input. In\nChapter 3, we focus on generating the referring expression, a text description\nfor an object in the image so that a receiver can infer which object is being\ndescribed. We use a comprehension machine to directly guide the generated\nreferring expressions to be more discriminative. In Chapter 4, we introduce a\nmethod that encourages discriminability in image caption generation. We show\nthat more discriminative captioning models generate more descriptive captions.\nIn Chapter 5, we study how training objectives and sampling methods affect the\nmodels' ability to generate diverse captions. We find that a popular captioning\ntraining strategy will be detrimental to the diversity of generated captions.\nIn Chapter 6, we propose a model that can control the length of generated\ncaptions. By changing the desired length, one can influence the style and\ndescriptiveness of the captions. Finally, in Chapter 7, we rank/generate\ninformative image tags according to their information utility. The proposed\nmethod better matches what humans think are the most important tags for the\nimages.",

Spatial accelerators, that parallelize\nmatrix/vector operations, are utilized for enhancing energy efficiency of DNN\ncomputation. Recently, model extraction attacks on simple accelerators, either\nwith a single processing element or running a binarized network, were\ndemonstrated using the methodology derived from differential power analysis\n(DPA) attack on cryptographic devices. This paper investigates the\nvulnerability of realistic spatial accelerators using general, 8-bit, number\nrepresentation.\nWe investigate two systolic array architectures with weight-stationary\ndataflow: (1) a 3 $\\times$ 1 array for a dot-product operation, and (2) a 3\n$\\times$ 3 array for matrix-vector multiplication. Both are implemented on the\nSAKURA-G FPGA board. We show that both architectures are ultimately vulnerable.\nA conventional DPA succeeds fully on the 1D array, requiring 20K power\nmeasurements. However, the 2D array exhibits higher security even with 460K\ntraces. We show that this is because the 2D array intrinsically entails\nmultiple MACs simultaneously dependent on the same input.

In our previous works, we have considered linear\nmultiscale problems, where the spatial heterogeneities are at subgrid level and\nare not resolved.

The\ncontrast-independent partially explicit time discretization divides the spatial\nspace into two components: contrast dependent (fast) and contrast independent\n(slow) spaces defined via multiscale space decomposition. Following this\ndecomposition, temporal splitting is proposed that treats fast components\nimplicitly and slow components explicitly. The space decomposition and temporal\nsplitting are chosen such that it guarantees a stability and formulate a\ncondition for the time stepping. This condition is formulated as a condition on\nslow spaces. In this paper, we extend this approach to nonlinear problems. We\npropose a splitting approach and derive a condition that guarantees stability.\nThis condition requires some type of contrast-independent spaces for slow\ncomponents of the solution.

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable performance of large-scale generative models in\nopen-domain conversation, they are known to be less practical for building\nreal-time conversation systems due to high latency. On the other hand,\nretrieval models could return responses with much lower latency but show\ninferior performance to the large-scale generative models since the\nconversation quality is bounded by the pre-defined response set. To take\nadvantage of both approaches, we propose a new training method called G2R\n(Generative-to-Retrieval distillation) that preserves the efficiency of a\nretrieval model while leveraging the conversational ability of a large-scale\ngenerative model by infusing the knowledge of the generative model into the\nretrieval model. G2R consists of two distinct techniques of distillation: the\ndata-level G2R augments the dialogue dataset with additional responses\ngenerated by the large-scale generative model, and the model-level G2R\ntransfers the response quality score assessed by the generative model to the\nscore of the retrieval model by the knowledge distillation loss. Through\nextensive experiments including human evaluation, we demonstrate that our\nretrieval-based conversation system trained with G2R shows a substantially\nimproved performance compared to the baseline retrieval model while showing\nsignificantly lower inference latency than the large-scale generative models.",

Recent studies have shown that depth, width and shortcut connections of\nneural network architectures play a crucial role in their performance. One of\nthe most advanced neural network architectures, DenseNet, has achieved\nexcellent convergence rates through dense connections. However, it still has\nobvious shortcomings in the usage of amount of memory. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new type of pruning tool, threshold, which refers to the principle\nof the threshold voltage in MOSFET. This work employs this method to connect\nblocks of different depths in different ways to reduce the usage of memory. It\nis denoted as ThresholdNet. We compare ThresholdNet with other different\nnetworks for FLOPs and memory usage, and the experiments show that ThresholdNet\nis 70% less memory than that of the original DenseNet.",

Deep neural networks have advanced this field\nby leveraging the power of large-scale labeled data, which, however, are\nextremely expensive and time-consuming to acquire. One solution is to use cheap\navailable data to train a model and deploy it to directly process the data from\na specific application domain. Nevertheless, the well-known domain shift (DS)\nissue prevents the trained model from generalizing well on the target domain.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel stagewise domain adaptation model called\nRoadDA to address the DS issue in this field. In the first stage, RoadDA adapts\nthe target domain features to align with the source ones via generative\nadversarial networks (GAN) based inter-domain adaptation. Specifically, a\nfeature pyramid fusion module is devised to avoid information loss of long and\nthin roads and learn discriminative and robust features. Besides, to address\nthe intra-domain discrepancy in the target domain, in the second stage, we\npropose an adversarial self-training method. We generate the pseudo labels of\ntarget domain using the trained generator and divide it to labeled easy split\nand unlabeled hard split based on the road confidence scores. The features of\nhard split are adapted to align with the easy ones using adversarial learning\nand the intra-domain adaptation process is repeated to progressively improve\nthe segmentation performance. Experiment results on two benchmarks demonstrate\nthat RoadDA can efficiently reduce the domain gap and outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

Our\nmethod only assumes that we can evaluate the integrand function $f$ and does\nnot assume a particular density nor the ability to sample from it. In\nparticular, for the analysis we show that the method of adding Bernoulli\npolynomials to a function to make it ``periodic'' on a box without changing its\nintegral value over the box, is equivalent to an orthogonal projection from a\nwell chosen Sobolev space of dominating mixed smoothness to an associated\nperiodic Sobolev space of the same dominating mixed smoothness, which we call a\nKorobov space. We note that the Bernoulli polynomial method is often not used\nbecause of its computational complexity and also here we completely avoid\napplying it. Instead, we use it as a theoretical tool in the error analysis of\napplying a scaled lattice rule to increasing boxes in order to approximate\nintegrals over the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. Such a method would not\nwork on the unit cube since then the committed error caused by non-periodicity\nof the integrand would be constant, but for integration on the Euclidean space\nwe can use the certain decay towards zero when the boxes grow.

    "abstract": "Depth Completion can produce a dense depth map from a sparse input and\nprovide a more complete 3D description of the environment. Despite great\nprogress made in depth completion, the sparsity of the input and low density of\nthe ground truth still make this problem challenging. In this work, we propose\nDenseLiDAR, a novel real-time pseudo-depth guided depth completion neural\nnetwork. We exploit dense pseudo-depth map obtained from simple morphological\noperations to guide the network in three aspects: (1) Constructing a residual\nstructure for the output; (2) Rectifying the sparse input data; (3) Providing\ndense structural loss for training the network. Thanks to these novel designs,\nhigher performance of the output could be achieved. In addition, two new\nmetrics for better evaluating the quality of the predicted depth map are also\npresented. Extensive experiments on KITTI depth completion benchmark suggest\nthat our model is able to achieve the state-of-the-art performance at the\nhighest frame rate of 50Hz. The predicted dense depth is further evaluated by\nseveral downstream robotic perception or positioning tasks. For the task of 3D\nobject detection, 3~5 percent performance gains on small objects categories are\nachieved on KITTI 3D object detection dataset. For RGB-D SLAM, higher accuracy\non vehicle's trajectory is also obtained in KITTI Odometry dataset. These\npromising results not only verify the high quality of our depth prediction, but\nalso demonstrate the potential of improving the related downstream tasks by\nusing depth completion results.",

    "abstract": "Fast inference of numerical model parameters from data is an important\nprerequisite to generate predictive models for a wide range of applications.\nUse of sampling-based approaches such as Markov chain Monte Carlo may become\nintractable when each likelihood evaluation is computationally expensive. New\napproaches combining variational inference with normalizing flow are\ncharacterized by a computational cost that grows only linearly with the\ndimensionality of the latent variable space, and rely on gradient-based\noptimization instead of sampling, providing a more efficient approach for\nBayesian inference about the model parameters. Moreover, the cost of frequently\nevaluating an expensive likelihood can be mitigated by replacing the true model\nwith an offline trained surrogate model, such as neural networks. However, this\napproach might generate significant bias when the surrogate is insufficiently\naccurate around the posterior modes. To reduce the computational cost without\nsacrificing inferential accuracy, we propose Normalizing Flow with Adaptive\nSurrogate (NoFAS), an optimization strategy that alternatively updates the\nnormalizing flow parameters and the weights of a neural network surrogate\nmodel. We also propose an efficient sample weighting scheme for surrogate model\ntraining that ensures some global accuracy of the surrogate while capturing the\nlikely regions of the parameters that yield the observed data. We demonstrate\nthe inferential and computational superiority of NoFAS against various\nbenchmarks, including cases where the underlying model lacks identifiability.\nThe source code and numerical experiments used for this study are available at\nhttps://github.com/cedricwangyu/NoFAS.",

We evaluated DKM-based compression on various DNN\nmodels for computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Our\nresults demonstrate that DMK delivers superior compression and accuracy\ntrade-off on ImageNet1k and GLUE benchmarks. For example, DKM-based compression\ncan offer 74.5% top-1 ImageNet1k accuracy on ResNet50 DNN model with 3.3MB\nmodel size (29.4x model compression factor). For MobileNet-v1, which is a\nchallenging DNN to compress, DKM delivers 62.8% top-1 ImageNet1k accuracy with\n0.74 MB model size (22.4x model compression factor).

    "abstract": "The goal of the current work is to explore direction-dependent damage\ninitiation and propagation within an arbitrary anisotropic solid. In\nparticular, we aim at developing anisotropic cohesive phase-field (PF) damage\nmodels by extending the idea introduced in \\cite{REZAEI2021a} for\ndirection-dependent fracture energy and also anisotropic PF damage models based\non structural tensors. The cohesive PF damage formulation used in the current\ncontribution is motivated by the works of \\cite{LORENTZ201120, wu2018,\nGEELEN2019}. The results of the latter models are shown to be insensitive with\nrespect to the length scale parameter for the isotropic case. This is because\nthey manage to formulate the fracture energy as a function of diffuse\ndisplacement jumps in the localized damaged zone. In the present paper, we\ndiscuss numerical examples and details on finite element implementations where\nthe fracture energy, as well as the material strength, are introduced as an\narbitrary function of the crack direction. Using the current formulation for\nanisotropic cohesive fracture, the obtained results are almost insensitive with\nrespect to the length scale parameter. The latter is achieved by including the\ndirection-dependent strength of the material in addition to its fracture\nenergy. Utilizing the current formulation, one can increase the mesh size which\nreduces the computational time significantly without any severe change in the\npredicted crack path and overall obtained load-displacement curves. We also\nargue that these models still lack to capture mode-dependent fracture\nproperties. Open issues and possible remedies for future developments are\nfinally discussed as well.",

    "abstract": "We propose a framework to study the effect of local recovery requirements of\ncodeword symbols on the dimension of linear codes, based on a combinatorial\nproxy that we call \\emph{visible rank}. The locality constraints of a linear\ncode are stipulated by a matrix $H$ of $\\star$'s and $0$'s (which we call a\n\"stencil\"), whose rows correspond to the local parity checks (with the\n$\\star$'s indicating the support of the check). The visible rank of $H$ is the\nlargest $r$ for which there is a $r \\times r$ submatrix in $H$ with a unique\ngeneralized diagonal of $\\star$'s. The visible rank yields a field-independent\ncombinatorial lower bound on the rank of $H$ and thus the co-dimension of the\ncode.\nWe prove a rank-nullity type theorem relating visible rank to the rank of an\nassociated construct called \\emph{symmetric spanoid}, which was introduced by\nDvir, Gopi, Gu, and Wigderson~\\cite{DGGW20}. Using this connection and a\nconstruction of appropriate stencils, we answer a question posed in\n\\cite{DGGW20} and demonstrate that symmetric spanoid rank cannot improve the\ncurrently best known $\\widetilde{O}(n^{(q-2)/(q-1)})$ upper bound on the\ndimension of $q$-query locally correctable codes (LCCs) of length $n$.\nWe also study the $t$-Disjoint Repair Group Property ($t$-DRGP) of codes\nwhere each codeword symbol must belong to $t$ disjoint check equations. It is\nknown that linear $2$-DRGP codes must have co-dimension $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$. We\nshow that there are stencils corresponding to $2$-DRGP with visible rank as\nsmall as $O(\\log n)$. However, we show the second tensor of any $2$-DRGP\nstencil has visible rank $\\Omega(n)$, thus recovering the $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$\nlower bound for $2$-DRGP. For $q$-LCC, however, the $k$'th tensor power for\n$k\\le n^{o(1)}$ is unable to improve the $\\widetilde{O}(n^{(q-2)/(q-1)})$ upper\nbound on the dimension of $q$-LCCs by a polynomial factor.",

The optimal operation of the power\nnetwork incorporating the VSC-MTDC system and FACTS devices is formulated in a\nstochastic conic programming framework accounting the uncertainties of the wind\npower generation. A methodology to generate representative scenarios of power\ngenerations from the wind farms is proposed using wind speed measurements and\nwind turbine models. The nonconvex transmission network constraints including\nthe VSC-MTDC system and FACTS devices are convexified through the proposed\nsecond-order cone AC optimal power flow model (SOC-ACOPF) that can be solved to\nthe global optimality using interior point method. In order to tackle the\ncomputational challenge due to the large number of wind power scenarios, a\nmodified Benders decomposition algorithm (M-BDA) accelerated by parallel\ncomputation is proposed. The energy dispatch of conventional power generators\nis formulated as the master problem of M-BDA.

    "abstract": "The main building block of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem is providing\nlow-cost scalable connectivity for the radio/compute-constrained devices. This\nconnectivity could be realized over the licensed spectrum like Narrowband-IoT\n(NBIoT) networks, or over the unlicensed spectrum like NBIoT-Unlicensed, SigFox\nand LoRa networks. In this paper, performance of IoT communications utilizing\nthe unlicensed band, e.g. the 863-870 MHz in the Europe, in indoor use-cases\nlike smart home, is investigated. More specifically, we focus on two scenarios\nfor channel access management: i) coordinated access, where the activity\npatterns of gateways and sensors are coordinated with neighbors, and ii)\nuncoordinated access, in which each gateway and its associated nodes work\nindependently from the neighbor ones. We further investigate a distributed\ncoordination scheme in which, devices learn to coordinate their activity\npatterns leveraging tools from reinforcement learning. Closed-form expressions\nfor capacity of the system, in terms of the number of sustained connections per\ngateway fulfilling a minimum quality of service (QoS) constraint are derived,\nand are further evaluated using simulations. Furthermore, delay-reliability and\ninter network interference-intra network collision performance tradeoffs\noffered by coordination are figured out. The simulation results highlight the\nimpact of system and traffic parameters on the performance tradeoffs and\ncharacterize performance regions in which coordinated scheme outperforms the\nuncoordinated one, and vice versa. For example, for a packet loss requirement\nof 1%, the number of connected devices could be doubled by coordination.",

We identify that three major challenges, i.e., moving\nobject discovery, rich temporal variation exploitation, and online update, are\nthe central causes of the performance bottleneck of existing unsupervised\ntrackers. To narrow the gap between unsupervised trackers and supervised\ncounterparts, we propose an effective unsupervised learning approach composed\nof three stages. First, we sample sequentially moving objects with unsupervised\noptical flow and dynamic programming, instead of random cropping. Second, we\ntrain a naive Siamese tracker from scratch using single-frame pairs. Third, we\ncontinue training the tracker with a novel cycle memory learning scheme, which\nis conducted in longer temporal spans and also enables our tracker to update\nonline. Extensive experiments show that the proposed USOT learned from\nunlabeled videos performs well over the state-of-the-art unsupervised trackers\nby large margins, and on par with recent supervised deep trackers.

    "abstract": "Serverless computing has become a new cloud computing paradigm that promises\nto deliver high cost-efficiency and simplified cloud deployment with automated\nresource scaling at a fine granularity. Users decouple a cloud application into\nchained functions and preset each serverless function's memory and CPU demands\nat megabyte-level and core-level, respectively. Serverless platforms then\nautomatically scale the number of functions to accommodate the workloads.\nHowever, the complexities of chained functions make it non-trivial to\naccurately determine the resource demands of each function for users, leading\nto either resource over-provision or under-provision for individual functions.\nThis paper presents FaaSRM, a new resource manager (RM) for serverless\nplatforms that maximizes resource efficiency by dynamically harvesting idle\nresources from functions over-supplied to functions under-supplied. FaaSRM\nmonitors each function's resource utilization in real-time, detects\nover-provisioning and under-provisioning, and applies deep reinforcement\nlearning to harvest idle resources safely using a safeguard mechanism and\naccelerate functions efficiently. We have implemented and deployed a FaaSRM\nprototype in a 13-node Apache OpenWhisk cluster. Experimental results on the\nOpenWhisk cluster show that FaaSRM reduces the execution time of 98% of\nfunction invocations by 35.81% compared to the baseline RMs by harvesting idle\nresources from 38.8% of the invocations and accelerating 39.2% of the\ninvocations.",

    "abstract": "The tremendous numbers of network security breaches that have occurred in IoT\nnetworks have demonstrated the unreliability of current Network Intrusion\nDetection Systems (NIDSs). Consequently, network interruptions and loss of\nsensitive data have occurred which led to an active research area for improving\nNIDS technologies. During an analysis of related works, it was observed that\nmost researchers aimed to obtain better classification results by using a set\nof untried combinations of Feature Reduction (FR) and Machine Learning (ML)\ntechniques on NIDS datasets. However, these datasets are different in feature\nsets, attack types, and network design. Therefore, this paper aims to discover\nwhether these techniques can be generalised across various datasets. Six ML\nmodels are utilised: a Deep Feed Forward, Convolutional Neural Network,\nRecurrent Neural Network, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes.\nThe detection accuracy of three Feature Extraction (FE) algorithms; Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA), Auto-encoder (AE), and Linear Discriminant Analysis\n(LDA) is evaluated using three benchmark datasets; UNSW-NB15, ToN-IoT and\nCSE-CIC-IDS2018. Although PCA and AE algorithms have been widely used,\ndetermining their optimal number of extracted dimensions has been overlooked.\nThe results obtained indicate that there is no clear FE method or ML model that\ncan achieve the best scores for all datasets. The optimal number of extracted\ndimensions has been identified for each dataset and LDA decreases the\nperformance of the ML models on two datasets. The variance is used to analyse\nthe extracted dimensions of LDA and PCA. Finally, this paper concludes that the\nchoice of datasets significantly alters the performance of the applied\ntechniques and we argue for the need for a universal (benchmark) feature set to\nfacilitate further advancement and progress in this field of research.",

    "abstract": "Event extraction (EE), the task that identifies event triggers and their\narguments in text, is usually formulated as a classification or structured\nprediction problem. Such models usually reduce labels to numeric identifiers,\nmaking them unable to take advantage of label semantics (e.g. an event type\nnamed Arrest is related to words like arrest, detain, or apprehend). This\nprevents the generalization to new event types. In this work, we formulate EE\nas a natural language generation task and propose GenEE, a model that not only\ncaptures complex dependencies within an event but also generalizes well to\nunseen or rare event types. Given a passage and an event type, GenEE is trained\nto generate a natural sentence following a predefined template for that event\ntype. The generated output is then decoded into trigger and argument\npredictions. The autoregressive generation process naturally models the\ndependencies among the predictions -- each new word predicted depends on those\nalready generated in the output sentence. Using carefully designed input\nprompts during generation, GenEE is able to capture label semantics, which\nenables the generalization to new event types. Empirical results show that our\nmodel achieves strong performance on event extraction tasks under all\nzero-shot, few-shot, and high-resource scenarios. Especially, in the\nhigh-resource setting, GenEE outperforms the state-of-the-art model on argument\nextraction and gets competitive results with the current best on end-to-end EE\ntasks.",

Powerful Machine Learning (ML) models have\nrecently been adopted to implement Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs),\nwhich can protect IIoT networks.

This paper provides an\nextensive analysis of the optimal feature sets in terms of the importance and\npredictive power of network attacks. Three feature selection algorithms;\nchi-square, information gain and correlation have been utilised to identify and\nrank data features. The features are fed into two ML classifiers; deep\nfeed-forward and random forest, to measure their attack detection accuracy. The\nexperimental evaluation considered three NIDS datasets: UNSW-NB15,\nCSE-CIC-IDS2018, and ToN-IoT in their proprietary flow format. In addition, the\nrespective variants in NetFlow format were also considered, i.e., NF-UNSW-NB15,\nNF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, and NF-ToN-IoT. The experimental evaluation explored the\nmarginal benefit of adding features one-by-one. Our results show that the\naccuracy initially increases rapidly with the addition of features, but\nconverges quickly to the maximum achievable detection accuracy. Our results\ndemonstrate a significant potential of reducing the computational and storage\ncost of NIDS while maintaining near-optimal detection accuracy.

The main\ngoal of this work is to develop a simple numerical method to predict the\nstructural strength and crack-growth-path of U-notched specimens made of\nbrittle materials. For this purpose, the Fragile Points Method (FPM), as\npreviously proposed by the authors, has been augmented by an interface damage\nmodel at the interfaces of the FPM domains, to simulate crack initiation and\ndevelopment. The formulations of FPM are based on a discontinuous Galerkin weak\nform where point-based piece-wise-continuous polynomial test and trial\nfunctions are used instead of element-based basis functions. In this work, the\nnumerical fluxes introduced across interior interfaces between subdomains are\npostulated as the tractions acting on the interface derived from an interface\ndamage model. The interface damage is triggered when the numerical flux reaches\nthe interface strength, and the process of crack-surface separation is governed\nby the fracture energy. In this way, arbitrary crack initiation and propagation\ncan be naturally simulated without the need for knowing the fracture-patch\nbefore-hand. Additionally, a small penalty parameter is sufficient to enforce\nthe weak-form continuity condition before damage initiation, without causing\nproblems such as artificial compliance and numerical ill-conditioning. As\nvalidations, the proposed FPM method with the interface damage model is used to\npredict the structural strength and crack-development from U-notched structures\nmade of brittle materials, which is useful but challenging in engineering\nstructural design practices.",

    "abstract": "Technology-assisted review (TAR) workflows based on iterative active learning\nare widely used in document review applications. Most stopping rules for\none-phase TAR workflows lack valid statistical guarantees, which has\ndiscouraged their use in some legal contexts. Drawing on the theory of quantile\nestimation, we provide the first broadly applicable and statistically valid\nsample-based stopping rules for one-phase TAR. We further show theoretically\nand empirically that overshooting a recall target, which has been treated as\ninnocuous or desirable in past evaluations of stopping rules, is a major source\nof excess cost in one-phase TAR workflows. Counterintuitively, incurring a\nlarger sampling cost to reduce excess recall leads to lower total cost in\nalmost all scenarios.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a hybrid dimming scheme based on joint LED selection and\nprecoding design (TASP-HD) for multiple-user (MU) multiple-cell (MC) visible\nlight communications (VLC) systems. In TASP-HD, both the LED selection and the\nprecoding of each cell can be dynamically adjusted to reduce the intra- and\ninter-cell interferences while satisfying illumination constraints. First, a\nMU-MC-VLC system model is established, and then a sum-rate maximization problem\nunder dimming level and illumination uniformity constraints is formulated. In\nthis studied problem, the indices of activated LEDs and precoding matrices are\noptimized, which result in a complex non-convex mixed integer problem. To solve\nthis problem, the original problem is separated into two subproblems. The first\nsubproblem, which maximizes the sum-rate of users via optimizing the LED\nselection with a given precoding matrix, is a mixed integer problem solved by\nthe penalty method. With the optimized LED selection matrix, the second\nsubproblem which focuses on the maximization of the sum-rate via optimizing the\nprecoding matrix is solved by the Lagrangian dual method. Finally, these two\nsubproblems are iteratively solved to obtain a convergent solution. Simulation\nresults verify that in a typical indoor scenario under a dimming level of 70%,\nthe mean bandwidth efficiency of TASP-HD is 4.8 bit/s/Hz and 7.13 bit/s/Hz\ngreater than AD and DD, respectively.",

    "title": "Second-Order Finite Automata",
    "abstract": "Traditionally, finite automata theory has been used as a framework for the\nrepresentation of possibly infinite sets of strings. In this work, we introduce\nthe notion of second-order finite automata, a formalism that combines finite\nautomata with ordered decision diagrams, with the aim of representing possibly\ninfinite {\\em sets of sets} of strings. Our main result states that\nsecond-order finite automata can be canonized with respect to the second-order\nlanguages they represent. Using this canonization result, we show that sets of\nsets of strings represented by second-order finite automata are closed under\nthe usual Boolean operations, such as union, intersection, difference and even\nunder a suitable notion of complementation. Additionally, emptiness of\nintersection and inclusion are decidable.\nWe provide two algorithmic applications for second-order automata. First, we\nshow that several width/size minimization problems for deterministic and\nnondeterministic ODDs are solvable in fixed-parameter tractable time when\nparameterized by the width of the input ODD. In particular, our results imply\nFPT algorithms for corresponding width/size minimization problems for ordered\nbinary decision diagrams (OBDDs) with a fixed variable ordering. Previously,\nonly algorithms that take exponential time in the size of the input OBDD were\nknown for width minimization, even for OBDDs of constant width. Second, we show\nthat for each $k$ and $w$ one can count the number of distinct functions\ncomputable by ODDs of width at most $w$ and length $k$ in time\n$h(|\\Sigma|,w)\\cdot k^{O(1)}$, for a suitable $h:\\mathbb{N}\\times\n\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$. This improves exponentially on the time\nnecessary to explicitly enumerate all such functions, which is exponential in\nboth the width parameter $w$ and in the length $k$ of the ODDs.",

    "abstract": "We propose to apply non-linear representation learning to voxelwise rs-fMRI\ndata. Learning the non-linear representations is done using a variational\nautoencoder (VAE). The VAE is trained on voxelwise rs-fMRI data and performs\nnon-linear dimensionality reduction that retains meaningful information. The\nretention of information in the model's representations is evaluated using\ndownstream age regression and sex classification tasks. The results on these\ntasks are highly encouraging and a linear regressor trained with the\nrepresentations of our unsupervised model performs almost as well as a\nsupervised neural network, trained specifically for age regression on the same\ndataset. The model is also evaluated with a schizophrenia diagnosis prediction\ntask, to assess its feasibility as a dimensionality reduction method for\nneuropsychiatric datasets. These results highlight the potential for\npre-training on a larger set of individuals who do not have mental illness, to\nimprove the downstream neuropsychiatric task results. The pre-trained model is\nfine-tuned for a variable number of epochs on a schizophrenia dataset and we\nfind that fine-tuning for 1 epoch yields the best results. This work therefore\nnot only opens up non-linear dimensionality reduction for voxelwise rs-fMRI\ndata but also shows that pre-training a deep learning model on voxelwise\nrs-fMRI datasets greatly increases performance even on smaller datasets. It\nalso opens up the ability to look at the distribution of rs-fMRI time series in\nthe latent space of the VAE for heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorders like\nschizophrenia in future work. This can be complemented with the generative\naspect of the model that allows us to reconstruct points from the model's\nlatent space back into brain space and obtain an improved understanding of the\nrelation that the VAE learns between subjects, timepoints, and a subject's\ncharacteristics.",

Standard classification models learned on such\ndata distribution often make biased predictions towards the head classes while\ngeneralizing poorly to the tail classes. In this paper, we present two\neffective modifications of CNNs to improve network learning from long-tailed\ndistribution. First, we present a Class Activation Map Calibration (CAMC)\nmodule to improve the learning and prediction of network classifiers, by\nenforcing network prediction based on important image regions. The proposed\nCAMC module highlights the correlated image regions across data and reinforces\nthe representations in these areas to obtain a better global representation for\nclassification. Furthermore, we investigate the use of normalized classifiers\nfor representation learning in long-tailed problems. Our empirical study\ndemonstrates that by simply scaling the outputs of the classifier with an\nappropriate scalar, we can effectively improve the classification accuracy on\ntail classes without losing the accuracy of head classes. We conduct extensive\nexperiments to validate the effectiveness of our design and we set new\nstate-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks, including ImageNet-LT,\nPlaces-LT, iNaturalist 2018, CIFAR10-LT, and CIFAR100-LT.",

Currently, our ability to\nbuild standardized deep learning models is limited by the availability of a\nsuite of neural network and corresponding training hyperparameter benchmarks\nthat expose differences between existing deep learning frameworks. In this\npaper, we present a living dataset of models and hyperparameters, called\nCrossedWires, that exposes semantic differences between two popular deep\nlearning frameworks: PyTorch and Tensorflow. The CrossedWires dataset currently\nconsists of models trained on CIFAR10 images using three different computer\nvision architectures: VGG16, ResNet50 and DenseNet121 across a large\nhyperparameter space. Using hyperparameter optimization, each of the three\nmodels was trained on 400 sets of hyperparameters suggested by the HyperSpace\nsearch algorithm. The CrossedWires dataset includes PyTorch and Tensforflow\nmodels with test accuracies as different as 0.681 on syntactically equivalent\nmodels and identical hyperparameter choices. The 340 GB dataset and benchmarks\npresented here include the performance statistics, training curves, and model\nweights for all 1200 hyperparameter choices, resulting in 2400 total models.\nThe CrossedWires dataset provides an opportunity to study semantic differences\nbetween syntactically equivalent models across popular deep learning\nframeworks. Further, the insights obtained from this study can enable the\ndevelopment of algorithms and tools that improve reliability and\nreproducibility of deep learning frameworks.

Significant computational\nchallenges are encountered when solving these equations due both to the kernel\nsingularity in the fractional integral operator and to the resulting dense\ndiscretized operators, which quickly become prohibitively expensive to handle\nbecause of their memory and arithmetic complexities.\nIn this work, we present a singularity-aware discretization scheme that\nregularizes the singular integrals through a singularity subtraction technique\nadapted to the spatial variability of diffusivity and fractional order. This\nregularization strategy is conveniently formulated as a sparse matrix\ncorrection that is added to the dense operator, and is applicable to different\nformulations of fractional diffusion equations. We also present a block low\nrank representation to handle the dense matrix representations, by exploiting\nthe ability to approximate blocks of the resulting formally dense matrix by low\nrank factorizations. A Cholesky factorization solver operates directly on this\nrepresentation using the low rank blocks as its atomic computational tiles, and\nachieves high performance on multicore hardware.\nNumerical results show that the singularity treatment is robust,\nsubstantially reduces discretization errors, and attains the first-order\nconvergence rate allowed by the regularity of the solutions.

While it has been\ndemonstrated that applying minimum-jerk-like trajectories to robot reaching\nmotions in the joint action task of human-robot handovers allows a robot giver\nto be perceived as more careful, safe, and skilled, it has not been verified\nwhether human reaching motions in handovers follow the Minimum Jerk model. To\nexperimentally test and verify motion models for human reaches in handovers, we\nexamined human reaching motions in unconstrained handovers (where the person is\nallowed to move their whole body) and fitted against 1) the Minimum Jerk model,\n2) its variation, the Decoupled Minimum Jerk model, and 3) the recently\nproposed Elliptical (Conic) model. Results showed that Conic model fits\nunconstrained human handover reaching motions best. Furthermore, we discovered\nthat unlike constrained, single-person reaching motions, which have been found\nto be elliptical, there is a split between elliptical and hyperbolic conic\ntypes. We expect our results will help guide generation of more humanlike\nreaching motions for human-robot handover tasks.",

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting is essential for a wide range of real-world\napplications. Recent studies have shown the superiority of Transformer in\ndealing with such problems, especially long sequence time series input(LSTI)\nand long sequence time series forecasting(LSTF) problems. To improve the\nefficiency and enhance the locality of Transformer, these studies combine\nTransformer with CNN in varying degrees. However, their combinations are\nloosely-coupled and do not make full use of CNN. To address this issue, we\npropose the concept of tightly-coupled convolutional Transformer(TCCT) and\nthree TCCT architectures which apply transformed CNN architectures into\nTransformer: (1) CSPAttention: through fusing CSPNet with self-attention\nmechanism, the computation cost of self-attention mechanism is reduced by 30%\nand the memory usage is reduced by 50% while achieving equivalent or beyond\nprediction accuracy. (2) Dilated causal convolution: this method is to modify\nthe distilling operation proposed by Informer through replacing canonical\nconvolutional layers with dilated causal convolutional layers to gain\nexponentially receptive field growth. (3) Passthrough mechanism: the\napplication of passthrough mechanism to stack of self-attention blocks helps\nTransformer-like models get more fine-grained information with negligible extra\ncomputation costs. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that our TCCT\narchitectures could greatly improve the performance of existing state-of-art\nTransformer models on time series forecasting with much lower computation and\nmemory costs, including canonical Transformer, LogTrans and Informer.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous Driving and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping(SLAM) are\nbecoming increasingly important in real world, where point cloud-based large\nscale place recognition is the spike of them. Previous place recognition\nmethods have achieved acceptable performances by regarding the task as a point\ncloud retrieval problem. However, all of them are suffered from a common\ndefect: they can't handle the situation when the point clouds are rotated,\nwhich is common, e.g, when viewpoints or motorcycle types are changed. To\ntackle this issue, we propose an Attentive Rotation Invariant Convolution\n(ARIConv) in this paper. The ARIConv adopts three kind of Rotation Invariant\nFeatures (RIFs): Spherical Signals (SS), Individual-Local Rotation Invariant\nFeatures (ILRIF) and Group-Local Rotation Invariant features (GLRIF) in its\nstructure to learn rotation invariant convolutional kernels, which are robust\nfor learning rotation invariant point cloud features. What's more, to highlight\npivotal RIFs, we inject an attentive module in ARIConv to give different RIFs\ndifferent importance when learning kernels. Finally, utilizing ARIConv, we\nbuild a DenseNet-like network architecture to learn rotation-insensitive global\ndescriptors used for retrieving. We experimentally demonstrate that our model\ncan achieve state-of-the-art performance on large scale place recognition task\nwhen the point cloud scans are rotated and can achieve comparable results with\nmost of existing methods on the original non-rotated datasets.",

    "abstract": "The spread of ransomware continues to cause devastation and is a major\nconcern for the security community. An often-used technique against this threat\nis the use of honey (or canary) files, which serve as ``trip wires'' to detect\nransomware in its early stages. However, in our analysis of ransomware samples\nfrom the wild, we discovered that attackers are well-aware of these traps, and\nnewer variants use several evasive strategies to bypass traditional honey\nfiles. Hence, we present the design of SentryFS - a specialized file system\nthat strategically ``sprays'' specially-crafted honey files across the file\nsystem. The canaries are generated using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and\nthe content and the metadata is constantly updated to make the canaries appear\nmore attractive for smarter ransomware that is selective in choosing victim\nfiles. Furthermore, to assist with the management of the honey files, SentryFS\nconnects with an anti-ransomware web service to download the latest\nintelligence on novel ransomware strategies to update the canaries. Finally, as\na contingency, SentryFS also leverages file clones to prevent processes from\nwriting to files directly in the event a highly stealthy ransomware goes\nundetected. In this case, the ransomware encrypts the clones rather than the\nactual files, leaving users' data unmodified. An AI agent then assigns a\nsuspicion score to the write activity so that users can approve/discard the\nchanges. As an early-warning system, the proposed design might help mitigate\nthe problem of ransomware.",

    "abstract": "This work mainly investigates the mean-square stability and stabilizability\nfor a single-input single-output networked linear feedback system. The control\nsignal in the networked system is transmitted over an unreliable channel. In\nthis unreliable channel, the data transmission times, referred to as channel\ninduced delays, are random values and the transmitted data could also be\ndropout with certain probability. The channel induced delays and packet dropout\nare modeled by an independent and identically distributed stochastic process\nwith a fixed probability mass function. At the channel terminal, a linear\ncombination of data received at one sampling time is applied to the plant of\nthe networked feedback system as a new control signal. To describe the\nuncertainty in the channel, a concept so called frequency response of variation\nis introduced for the unreliable channel. With the given linear receiving\nstrategy, a mean-square stability criterion is established in terms of the\nfrequency response of variation of the unreliable channel for the networked\nfeedback system. It is shown by this criterion that the mean-square stability\nis determined by the interaction between the frequency response of variation\nand the nominal feedback system. The role played by the random channel induced\ndelays is the same as that played by a colored additive noise in an additive\nnoise channel with a signal-to-noise ratio constraint. Moreover, the\nmean-square input-output stabilizability via output feedback is studied for the\nnetworked system. When the plant in the networked feedback system is minimum\nphase, an analytic necessary and sufficient condition is presented for its\nmean-square input-output stabilizability. It turns out that the stabilizability\nis only determined by the interaction between the frequency response of\nvariation of the channel and unstable poles of the plant.",

However, current adversarial training\nmethods only attack the original input sample or the embedding vectors, and\ntheir attacks lack coverage and diversity. To further enhance the breadth and\ndepth of attack, we propose a novel masked weight adversarial training method\ncalled DropAttack, which enhances generalization of model by adding\nintentionally worst-case adversarial perturbations to both the input and hidden\nlayers in different dimensions and minimize the adversarial risks generated by\neach layer. DropAttack is a general technique and can be adopt to a wide\nvariety of neural networks with different architectures. To validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method, we used five public datasets in the\nfields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) for\nexperimental evaluating.

    "abstract": "In resource allocation, it is common to assume that agents have a utility for\ntheir allocated items and zero utility for unallocated ones. We refer to such\nvaluation domain as 1-D. This assumption of zero utility for unallocated items\nis not always valid. For example, in the pandemic, allocation of ventilators,\noxygen beds, and critical medical help yields dis-utility to an agent when not\nreceived in time, i.e., a setting where people consume resources at the cost of\nothers' utility. Various externalities affect an agent's utility, i.e., when an\nagent doesn't receive an item, it can result in their gain (positive\nexternalities) or loss (negative externalities). The existing preference models\nlack capturing the setting with these externalities. We conduct a study on a\n2-D domain, where each agent has a utility ($v$) for an item assigned to it and\nutility ($v'$) for an item not allocated to it. We consider a generalized\nmodel, i.e., goods and chores. There is a vast literature to allocate fairly\nand efficiently. We observe that adapting the existing notions of fairness and\nefficiency to the 2-D domain is non-trivial.\nWe propose a utility transformation ($T_u$) and valuation transformation\n($T_v$) to convert from the 2-D domain to 1-D. We study the retention of\nfairness and efficiency property given this transformation, i.e., an allocation\nwith property $\\mathcal{P}$ in a 1-D domain also satisfies property\n$\\mathcal{P}$ in 2-D, and vice versa. If a property is retainable, we can apply\nthe transformation, and all the existing approaches are valid for the 2-D\ndomain. Further, we study whether we can apply current results in a 2-D domain\nwhen they do not retain. We explore fairness notions such as Envy-freeness\n(EF), Equitability (EQ), Maxmin Share (MMS), and Proportionality and efficiency\nnotions such as Pareto Optimality, Utilitarian Welfare, Nash Welfare, and\nEgalitarian Welfare.",

Every airport generally has a variety of planes with various\nphysical and technological requirements as well as diverse service\nrequirements. Detecting the presence of new planes will not address all traffic\ncongestion issues. Identifying the type of airplane, on the other hand, will\nentirely fix the problem because it will offer important information about the\nplane's technical specifications (i.e., the time it needs to be served and its\nappropriate place in the airport). Several studies have provided various\ncontributions to address airport traffic jams; however, their ultimate goal was\nto determine the existence of airplane objects. This paper provides a practical\napproach to identify the type of airplane in airports depending on the results\nprovided by the airplane detection process using mask region convolution neural\nnetwork. The key feature employed to identify the type of airplane is the\nsurface area calculated based on the results of airplane detection. The surface\narea is used to assess the estimated cabin length which is considered as an\nadditional key feature for identifying the airplane type. The length of any\ndetected plane may be calculated by measuring the distance between the detected\nplane's two furthest points.

    "title": "Airplane Detection Based on Mask Region Convolution Neural Network",
    "abstract": "Addressing airport traffic jams is one of the most crucial and challenging\ntasks in the remote sensing field, especially for the busiest airports. Several\nsolutions have been employed to address this problem depending on the airplane\ndetection process. The most effective solutions are through the use of\nsatellite images with deep learning techniques. Such solutions, however, are\nsignificantly costly and require satellites and modern complicated technology\nwhich may not be available in most countries worldwide. This paper provides a\nuniversal, low cost and fast solution for airplane detection in airports. This\npaper recommends the use of drones instead of satellites to feed the system\nwith drone images using a proposed deep learning model. Drone images are\nemployed as the dataset to train and evaluate a mask region convolution neural\nnetwork (RCNN) model. The Mask RCNN model applies faster RCNN as its base\nconfiguration with critical modifications on its head neural network\nconstructions. The model detects whether or not an airplane is present and\nincludes mask estimations to approximate surface area and length, which will\nhelp future works identify the airplane type. This solution can be easily\nimplemented globally as it is a low-cost and fast solution for airplane\ndetection at airports. The evaluation process reveals promising results\naccording to Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) metrics.",

    "title": "A Hybrid Rule-Based and Data-Driven Approach to Driver Modeling through  Particle Filtering",
    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles need to model the behavior of surrounding human driven\nvehicles to be safe and efficient traffic participants. Existing approaches to\nmodeling human driving behavior have relied on both data-driven and rule-based\nmethods. While data-driven models are more expressive, rule-based models are\ninterpretable, which is an important requirement for safety-critical domains\nlike driving. However, rule-based models are not sufficiently representative of\ndata, and data-driven models are yet unable to generate realistic traffic\nsimulation due to unrealistic driving behavior such as collisions. In this\npaper, we propose a methodology that combines rule-based modeling with\ndata-driven learning. While the rules are governed by interpretable parameters\nof the driver model, these parameters are learned online from driving\ndemonstration data using particle filtering. We perform driver modeling\nexperiments on the task of highway driving and merging using data from three\nreal-world driving demonstration datasets. Our results show that driver models\nbased on our hybrid rule-based and data-driven approach can accurately capture\nreal-world driving behavior. Further, we assess the realism of the driving\nbehavior generated by our model by having humans perform a driving Turing test,\nwhere they are asked to distinguish between videos of real driving and those\ngenerated using our driver models.",

    "title": "Analyzing and Mitigating Interference in Neural Architecture Search",
    "abstract": "Weight sharing has become the \\textit{de facto} approach to reduce the\ntraining cost of neural architecture search (NAS) by reusing the weights of\nshared operators from previously trained child models. However, the estimated\naccuracy of those child models has a low rank correlation with the ground truth\naccuracy due to the interference among different child models caused by weight\nsharing. In this paper, we investigate the interference issue by sampling\ndifferent child models and calculating the gradient similarity of shared\noperators, and observe that: 1) the interference on a shared operator between\ntwo child models is positively correlated to the number of different operators\nbetween them; 2) the interference is smaller when the inputs and outputs of the\nshared operator are more similar. Inspired by these two observations, we\npropose two approaches to mitigate the interference: 1) rather than randomly\nsampling child models for optimization, we propose a gradual modification\nscheme by modifying one operator between adjacent optimization steps to\nminimize the interference on the shared operators; 2) forcing the inputs and\noutputs of the operator across all child models to be similar to reduce the\ninterference. Experiments on a BERT search space verify that mitigating\ninterference via each of our proposed methods improves the rank correlation of\nsuper-pet and combining both methods can achieve better results. Our searched\narchitecture outperforms RoBERTa$_{\\rm base}$ by 1.1 and 0.6 scores and\nELECTRA$_{\\rm base}$ by 1.6 and 1.1 scores on the dev and test set of GLUE\nbenchmark. Extensive results on the BERT compression task, SQuAD datasets and\nother search spaces also demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our\nproposed methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper tackles the problem of automatically labelling sentiment-bearing\ntopics with descriptive sentence labels. We propose two approaches to the\nproblem, one extractive and the other abstractive. Both approaches rely on a\nnovel mechanism to automatically learn the relevance of each sentence in a\ncorpus to sentiment-bearing topics extracted from that corpus. The extractive\napproach uses a sentence ranking algorithm for label selection which for the\nfirst time jointly optimises topic--sentence relevance as well as\naspect--sentiment co-coverage. The abstractive approach instead addresses\naspect--sentiment co-coverage by using sentence fusion to generate a sentential\nlabel that includes relevant content from multiple sentences. To our knowledge,\nwe are the first to study the problem of labelling sentiment-bearing topics.\nOur experimental results on three real-world datasets show that both the\nextractive and abstractive approaches outperform four strong baselines in terms\nof facilitating topic understanding and interpretation. In addition, when\ncomparing extractive and abstractive labels, our evaluation shows that our best\nperforming abstractive method is able to provide more topic information\ncoverage in fewer words, at the cost of generating less grammatical labels than\nthe extractive method. We conclude that abstractive methods can effectively\nsynthesise the rich information contained in sentiment-bearing topics.",

    "abstract": "The requirements of vehicular communications grow with increasing level of\nautomated driving and future applications of intelligent transportation systems\n(ITS). Beside the ever-increasing need for high capacity radio links,\nreliability and latency constraints challenge the mobile network supply. While\nfor example the millimeter-wave spectrum and THz-bands offer a vast amount of\nradio resources, their applicability is limited due to delicate radio channel\nconditions and signal propagation characteristics. Reconfigurable intelligent\nsurfaces (RISs) as part of smart radio environments (SREs) of future ITS\ninfrastructure promise improved radio link qualities by means of purposeful\ncultivation of passive reflections. With this, obstructed mmWave or THz beams\ncan be guided around obstacles through RIS reflection paths to improve the\notherwise limited coverage. In this article, application use cases of\nRIS-enhanced vehicular communications are proposed. Beside static deployments\nof RISs at exterior walls of buildings, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) could\nprovide reflection capabilities on demand, while future vehicles could - in a\nvisionary approach - consist of meta-material allowing for their opportunistic\nutilization within an enriched SRE. Results of a case study based on our\nmulti-scale mobility and network simulation model clearly highlight the\npotential of RIS deployment for hybrid vehicular communication scenarios.

The data were analyzed using Excel 2016 and IBM-SPSS\nversion 24.0, and visualized using VOSviewer software. Most of the retractions\nwere due to fake peer review (95 retractions) and plagiarism (90). The average\ntime between a publication and its retraction was 591 days. The maximum\ntime-lag (about 3,000 days) occurred for papers retracted due to duplicate\npublications; the minimum time-lag (fewer than 100 days) was for papers\nretracted due to ''unspecified cause'' (most of these were conference papers).\nAs many as 48 (14%) of the retracted papers were published in two medical\njournals: Tumor Biology (25 papers) and Diagnostic Pathology (23 papers).

    "title": "Differentiable Convolution Search for Point Cloud Processing",
    "abstract": "Exploiting convolutional neural networks for point cloud processing is quite\nchallenging, due to the inherent irregular distribution and discrete shape\nrepresentation of point clouds. To address these problems, many handcrafted\nconvolution variants have sprung up in recent years. Though with elaborate\ndesign, these variants could be far from optimal in sufficiently capturing\ndiverse shapes formed by discrete points. In this paper, we propose\nPointSeaConv, i.e., a novel differential convolution search paradigm on point\nclouds. It can work in a purely data-driven manner and thus is capable of\nauto-creating a group of suitable convolutions for geometric shape modeling. We\nalso propose a joint optimization framework for simultaneous search of internal\nconvolution and external architecture, and introduce epsilon-greedy algorithm\nto alleviate the effect of discretization error. As a result, PointSeaNet, a\ndeep network that is sufficient to capture geometric shapes at both convolution\nlevel and architecture level, can be searched out for point cloud processing.\nExtensive experiments strongly evidence that our proposed PointSeaNet surpasses\ncurrent handcrafted deep models on challenging benchmarks across multiple tasks\nwith remarkable margins.",

    "abstract": "In this manuscript, we propose a multiclass data description model based on\nkernel Mahalanobis distance (MDD-KM) with self-adapting hyperparameter setting.\nMDD-KM provides uncertainty quantification and can be deployed to build\nclassification systems for the realistic scenario where out-of-distribution\n(OOD) samples are present among the test data. Given a test signal, a quantity\nrelated to empirical kernel Mahalanobis distance between the signal and each of\nthe training classes is computed. Since these quantities correspond to the same\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space, they are commensurable and hence can be\nreadily treated as classification scores without further application of fusion\ntechniques. To set kernel parameters, we exploit the fact that predictive\nvariance according to a Gaussian process (GP) is empirical kernel Mahalanobis\ndistance when a centralized kernel is used, and propose to use GP's negative\nlikelihood function as the cost function. We conduct experiments on the real\nproblem of avian note classification. We report a prototypical classification\nsystem based on a hierarchical linear dynamical system with MDD-KM as a\ncomponent. Our classification system does not require sound event detection as\na preprocessing step, and is able to find instances of training avian notes\nwith varying length among OOD samples (corresponding to unknown notes of\ndisinterest) in the test audio clip.

    "abstract": "As one of the basic tasks of computer vision, object detection has been\nwidely used in many intelligent applications. However, object detection\nalgorithms are usually heavyweight in computation, hindering their\nimplementations on resource-constrained edge devices. Current edge-cloud\ncollaboration methods, such as CNN partition over Edge-cloud devices, are not\nsuitable for object detection since the huge data size of the intermediate\nresults will introduce extravagant communication costs. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a small-big model framework that deploys a big model in\nthe cloud and a small model on the edge devices. Upon receiving data, the edge\ndevice operates a difficult-case discriminator to classify the images into easy\ncases and difficult cases according to the specific semantics of the images.\nThe easy cases will be processed locally at the edge, and the difficult cases\nwill be uploaded to the cloud. Experimental results on the VOC, COCO, HELMET\ndatasets using two different object detection algorithms demonstrate that the\nsmall-big model system can detect 94.01%-97.84% of objects with only about 50%\nimages uploaded to the cloud when using SSD.

Despite the\neffectiveness and elegance of the current neural network Gaussian process\ntheory, to the best of our knowledge, all the neural network Gaussian processes\nare essentially induced by increasing width. However, in the era of deep\nlearning, what concerns us more regarding a neural network is its depth as well\nas how depth impacts the behaviors of a network. Inspired by a width-depth\nsymmetry consideration, we use a shortcut network to show that increasing the\ndepth of a neural network can also give rise to a Gaussian process, which is a\nvaluable addition to the existing theory and contributes to revealing the true\npicture of deep learning. Beyond the proposed Gaussian process by depth, we\ntheoretically characterize its uniform tightness property and the smallest\neigenvalue of its associated kernel. These characterizations can not only\nenhance our understanding of the proposed depth-induced Gaussian processes, but\nalso pave the way for future applications.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a\nwell-labeled source domain to a different but related unlabeled target domain\nwith identical label space. Currently, the main workhorse for solving UDA is\ndomain alignment, which has proven successful. However, it is often difficult\nto find an appropriate source domain with identical label space. A more\npractical scenario is so-called partial domain adaptation (PDA) in which the\nsource label set or space subsumes the target one. Unfortunately, in PDA, due\nto the existence of the irrelevant categories in the source domain, it is quite\nhard to obtain a perfect alignment, thus resulting in mode collapse and\nnegative transfer. Although several efforts have been made by down-weighting\nthe irrelevant source categories, the strategies used tend to be burdensome and\nrisky since exactly which irrelevant categories are unknown. These challenges\nmotivate us to find a relatively simpler alternative to solve PDA. To achieve\nthis, we first provide a thorough theoretical analysis, which illustrates that\nthe target risk is bounded by both model smoothness and between-domain\ndiscrepancy. Considering the difficulty of perfect alignment in solving PDA, we\nturn to focus on the model smoothness while discard the riskier domain\nalignment to enhance the adaptability of the model. Specifically, we\ninstantiate the model smoothness as a quite simple intra-domain structure\npreserving (IDSP). To our best knowledge, this is the first naive attempt to\naddress the PDA without domain alignment. Finally, our empirical results on\nmultiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that IDSP is not only superior to the\nPDA SOTAs by a significant margin on some benchmarks (e.g., +10% on Cl->Rw and\n+8% on Ar->Rw ), but also complementary to domain alignment in the standard UDA",

    "abstract": "Traversing through a tilted narrow gap is previously an intractable task for\nreinforcement learning mainly due to two challenges. First, searching feasible\ntrajectories is not trivial because the goal behind the gap is difficult to\nreach. Second, the error tolerance after Sim2Real is low due to the relatively\nhigh speed in comparison to the gap's narrow dimensions. This problem is\naggravated by the intractability of collecting real-world data due to the risk\nof collision damage. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement\nlearning framework that solves this task successfully by addressing both\nproblems. To search for dynamically feasible flight trajectories, we use\ncurriculum learning to guide the agent towards the sparse reward behind the\nobstacle. To tackle the Sim2Real problem, we propose a Sim2Real framework that\ncan transfer control commands to a real quadrotor without using real flight\ndata.

    "title": "Layout-to-Image Translation with Double Pooling Generative Adversarial  Networks",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the task of layout-to-image translation, which aims\nto translate an input semantic layout to a realistic image. One open challenge\nwidely observed in existing methods is the lack of effective semantic\nconstraints during the image translation process, leading to models that cannot\npreserve the semantic information and ignore the semantic dependencies within\nthe same object. To address this issue, we propose a novel Double Pooing GAN\n(DPGAN) for generating photo-realistic and semantically-consistent results from\nthe input layout. We also propose a novel Double Pooling Module (DPM), which\nconsists of the Square-shape Pooling Module (SPM) and the Rectangle-shape\nPooling Module (RPM). Specifically, SPM aims to capture short-range semantic\ndependencies of the input layout with different spatial scales, while RPM aims\nto capture long-range semantic dependencies from both horizontal and vertical\ndirections. We then effectively fuse both outputs of SPM and RPM to further\nenlarge the receptive field of our generator. Extensive experiments on five\npopular datasets show that the proposed DPGAN achieves better results than\nstate-of-the-art methods. Finally, both SPM and SPM are general and can be\nseamlessly integrated into any GAN-based architectures to strengthen the\nfeature representation.

    "abstract": "Locating bugs is an important, but effort-intensive and time-consuming task,\nwhen dealing with large-scale systems. To address this, Information Retrieval\n(IR) techniques are increasingly being used to suggest potential buggy source\ncode locations, for given bug reports. While IR techniques are very scalable,\nin practice their effectiveness in accurately localizing bugs in a software\nsystem remains low. Results of empirical studies suggest that the effectiveness\nof bug localization techniques can be augmented by the configuration of queries\nused to locate buggy code. However, in most IR-based bug localization\ntechniques, presented by researchers, the impact of the queries' configurations\nis not fully considered. In a similar vein, techniques consider all code\nelements as equally suspicious of being buggy while localizing bugs, but this\nis not always the case either.In this paper, we present a new method-level,\ninformation-retrieval-based bug localization technique called ``BoostNSift''.\nBoostNSift exploits the important information in queries by `boost'ing that\ninformation, and then `sift's the identified code elements, based on a novel\ntechnique that emphasizes the code elements' specific relatedness to a bug\nreport over its generic relatedness to all bug reports. To evaluate the\nperformance of BoostNSift, we employed a state-of-the-art empirical design that\nhas been commonly used for evaluating file level IR-based bug localization\ntechniques: 6851 bugs are selected from commonly used Eclipse, AspectJ, SWT,\nand ZXing benchmarks and made openly available for method-level analyses.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation has become one of the most important model compression\ntechniques by distilling knowledge from larger teacher networks to smaller\nstudent ones. Although great success has been achieved by prior distillation\nmethods via delicately designing various types of knowledge, they overlook the\nfunctional properties of neural networks, which makes the process of applying\nthose techniques to new tasks unreliable and non-trivial. To alleviate such\nproblem, in this paper, we initially leverage Lipschitz continuity to better\nrepresent the functional characteristic of neural networks and guide the\nknowledge distillation process. In particular, we propose a novel Lipschitz\nContinuity Guided Knowledge Distillation framework to faithfully distill\nknowledge by minimizing the distance between two neural networks' Lipschitz\nconstants, which enables teacher networks to better regularize student networks\nand improve the corresponding performance. We derive an explainable\napproximation algorithm with an explicit theoretical derivation to address the\nNP-hard problem of calculating the Lipschitz constant. Experimental results\nhave shown that our method outperforms other benchmarks over several knowledge\ndistillation tasks (e.g., classification, segmentation and object detection) on\nCIFAR-100, ImageNet, and PASCAL VOC datasets.",

    "abstract": "Although well-established in general reinforcement learning (RL), value-based\nmethods are rarely explored in constrained RL (CRL) for their incapability of\nfinding policies that can randomize among multiple actions. To apply\nvalue-based methods to CRL, a recent groundbreaking line of game-theoretic\napproaches uses the mixed policy that randomizes among a set of carefully\ngenerated policies to converge to the desired constraint-satisfying policy.\nHowever, these approaches require storing a large set of policies, which is not\npolicy efficient, and may incur prohibitive memory costs in constrained deep\nRL. To address this problem, we propose an alternative approach. Our approach\nfirst reformulates the CRL to an equivalent distance optimization problem. With\na specially designed linear optimization oracle, we derive a meta-algorithm\nthat solves it using any off-the-shelf RL algorithm and any conditional\ngradient (CG) type algorithm as subroutines. We then propose a new variant of\nthe CG-type algorithm, which generalizes the minimum norm point (MNP) method.\nThe proposed method matches the convergence rate of the existing game-theoretic\napproaches and achieves the worst-case optimal policy efficiency.

The impact on humanity is\nhuge: each of these codes has been used in global wireless communication\nstandards (satellite, WiFi, cellular). Reliability of communication over the\nclassical additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel enables benchmarking and\nranking of the different codes. In this paper, we construct KO codes, a\ncomputationaly efficient family of deep-learning driven (encoder, decoder)\npairs that outperform the state-of-the-art reliability performance on the\nstandardized AWGN channel. KO codes beat state-of-the-art Reed-Muller and Polar\ncodes, under the low-complexity successive cancellation decoding, in the\nchallenging short-to-medium block length regime on the AWGN channel. We show\nthat the gains of KO codes are primarily due to the nonlinear mapping of\ninformation bits directly to transmit real symbols (bypassing modulation) and\nyet possess an efficient, high performance decoder.

We\npresent NeuroCartography, an interactive system that scalably summarizes and\nvisualizes concepts learned by neural networks. It automatically discovers and\ngroups neurons that detect the same concepts, and describes how such neuron\ngroups interact to form higher-level concepts and the subsequent predictions.\nNeuroCartography introduces two scalable summarization techniques: (1) neuron\nclustering groups neurons based on the semantic similarity of the concepts\ndetected by neurons (e.g., neurons detecting \"dog faces\" of different breeds\nare grouped); and (2) neuron embedding encodes the associations between related\nconcepts based on how often they co-occur (e.g., neurons detecting \"dog face\"\nand \"dog tail\" are placed closer in the embedding space). Key to our scalable\ntechniques is the ability to efficiently compute all neuron pairs'\nrelationships, in time linear to the number of neurons instead of quadratic\ntime. NeuroCartography scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with\n1.2M images.

    "abstract": "Justified representation (JR) is a standard notion of representation in\nmultiwinner approval voting. Not only does a JR committee always exist, but\nprevious work has also shown through experiments that the JR condition can\ntypically be fulfilled by groups of fewer than $k$ candidates. In this paper,\nwe study such groups -- known as $n/k$-justifying groups -- both theoretically\nand empirically. First, we show that under the impartial culture model,\n$n/k$-justifying groups of size less than $k/2$ are likely to exist, which\nimplies that the number of JR committees is usually large. We then present\nefficient approximation algorithms that compute a small $n/k$-justifying group\nfor any given instance, and a polynomial-time exact algorithm when the instance\nadmits a tree representation. In addition, we demonstrate that small\n$n/k$-justifying groups can often be useful for obtaining a gender-balanced JR\ncommittee even though the problem is NP-hard.",

    "abstract": "The task of reflection symmetry detection remains challenging due to\nsignificant variations and ambiguities of symmetry patterns in the wild.\nFurthermore, since the local regions are required to match in reflection for\ndetecting a symmetry pattern, it is hard for standard convolutional networks,\nwhich are not equivariant to rotation and reflection, to learn the task. To\naddress the issue, we introduce a new convolutional technique, dubbed the polar\nmatching convolution, which leverages a polar feature pooling, a\nself-similarity encoding, and a systematic kernel design for axes of different\nangles. The proposed high-dimensional kernel convolution network effectively\nlearns to discover symmetry patterns from real-world images, overcoming the\nlimitations of standard convolution.

The performance of a range of music segmentation\nalgorithms has been shown to be dependent on the audio features chosen to\nrepresent the audio. Some approaches have proposed learning feature\ntransformations from music segment annotation data, although, such data is time\nconsuming or expensive to create and as such these approaches are likely\nlimited by the size of their datasets. While annotated music segmentation data\nis a scarce resource, the amount of available music audio is much greater. In\nthe neighboring field of semantic audio unsupervised deep learning has shown\npromise in improving the performance of solutions to the query-by-example and\nsound classification tasks. In this work, unsupervised training of deep feature\nembeddings using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is explored for music\nsegmentation. The proposed techniques exploit only the time proximity of audio\nfeatures that is implicit in any audio timeline. Employing these embeddings in\na classic music segmentation algorithm is shown not only to significantly\nimprove the performance of this algorithm, but obtain state of the art\nperformance in unsupervised music segmentation.",

Given\na pair of textured source and target objects, our method predicts a part-aware\naffine transformation field that naturally warps the source shape to imitate\nthe overall geometric style of the target. In addition, the texture style of\nthe target is transferred to the warped source object with the help of a\nmulti-view differentiable renderer. Our model, 3DStyleNet, is composed of two\nsub-networks trained in two stages. First, the geometric style network is\ntrained on a large set of untextured 3D shapes. Second, we jointly optimize our\ngeometric style network and a pre-trained image style transfer network with\nlosses defined over both the geometry and the rendering of the result.

However,\nexisting benchmarks such as GLUE and GLGE tend to focus on short text\nunderstanding and generation tasks, without considering long text modeling,\nwhich requires many distinct capabilities such as modeling long-range\ncommonsense and discourse relations, as well as the coherence and\ncontrollability of generation. The lack of standardized benchmarks makes it\ndifficult to fully evaluate these capabilities of a model and fairly compare\ndifferent models, especially Chinese pretraining models. Therefore, we propose\nLOT, a benchmark including two understanding and two generation tasks for\nChinese long text modeling evaluation. We construct the datasets for the tasks\nbased on various kinds of human-written Chinese stories. Besides, we release an\nencoder-decoder Chinese long text pretraining model named LongLM with up to 1\nbillion parameters. We pretrain LongLM on 120G Chinese novels with two\ngenerative tasks including text infilling and conditional continuation.\nExtensive experiments on LOT demonstrate that LongLM matches the performance of\nsimilar-sized pretraining models on the understanding tasks and outperforms\nstrong baselines substantially on the generation tasks.",

    "abstract": "Scheduled sampling is widely used to mitigate the exposure bias problem for\nneural machine translation. Its core motivation is to simulate the inference\nscene during training by replacing ground-truth tokens with predicted tokens,\nthus bridging the gap between training and inference. However, vanilla\nscheduled sampling is merely based on training steps and equally treats all\ndecoding steps. Namely, it simulates an inference scene with uniform error\nrates, which disobeys the real inference scene, where larger decoding steps\nusually have higher error rates due to error accumulations. To alleviate the\nabove discrepancy, we propose scheduled sampling methods based on decoding\nsteps, increasing the selection chance of predicted tokens with the growth of\ndecoding steps. Consequently, we can more realistically simulate the inference\nscene during training, thus better bridging the gap between training and\ninference. Moreover, we investigate scheduled sampling based on both training\nsteps and decoding steps for further improvements. Experimentally, our\napproaches significantly outperform the Transformer baseline and vanilla\nscheduled sampling on three large-scale WMT tasks. Additionally, our approaches\nalso generalize well to the text summarization task on two popular benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Generating font glyphs of consistent style from one or a few reference\nglyphs, i.e., font completion, is an important task in topographical design. As\nthe problem is more well-defined than general image style transfer tasks, thus\nit has received interest from both vision and machine learning communities.\nExisting approaches address this problem as a direct image-to-image translation\ntask. In this work, we innovate to explore the generation of font glyphs as 2D\ngraphic objects with the graph as an intermediate representation, so that more\nintrinsic graphic properties of font styles can be captured. Specifically, we\nformulate a cross-modality cycled image-to-image model structure with a graph\nconstructor between an image encoder and an image renderer. The novel graph\nconstructor maps a glyph's latent code to its graph representation that matches\nexpert knowledge, which is trained to help the translation task.

Furthermore, the graph\nrepresentation output by our model also provides an intuitive interface for\nusers to do local editing and manipulation.

    "abstract": "Code summarization aims to generate concise natural language descriptions of\nsource code, which can help improve program comprehension and maintenance.\nRecent studies show that syntactic and structural information extracted from\nabstract syntax trees (ASTs) is conducive to summary generation. However,\nexisting approaches fail to fully capture the rich information in ASTs because\nof the large size/depth of ASTs. In this paper, we propose a novel model CAST\nthat hierarchically splits and reconstructs ASTs. First, we hierarchically\nsplit a large AST into a set of subtrees and utilize a recursive neural network\nto encode the subtrees. Then, we aggregate the embeddings of subtrees by\nreconstructing the split ASTs to get the representation of the complete AST.\nFinally, AST representation, together with source code embedding obtained by a\nvanilla code token encoder, is used for code summarization. Extensive\nexperiments, including the ablation study and the human evaluation, on\nbenchmarks have demonstrated the power of CAST.

    "abstract": "In multi-agent reinforcement learning, the behaviors that agents learn in a\nsingle Markov Game (MG) are typically confined to the given agent number (i.e.,\npopulation size). Every single MG induced by varying population sizes may\npossess distinct optimal joint strategies and game-specific knowledge, which\nare modeled independently in modern multi-agent algorithms. In this work, we\nfocus on creating agents that generalize across population-varying MGs. Instead\nof learning a unimodal policy, each agent learns a policy set that is formed by\neffective strategies across a variety of games. We propose Meta Representations\nfor Agents (MRA) that explicitly models the game-common and game-specific\nstrategic knowledge. By representing the policy sets with multi-modal latent\npolicies, the common strategic knowledge and diverse strategic modes are\ndiscovered with an iterative optimization procedure. We prove that as an\napproximation to a constrained mutual information maximization objective, the\nlearned policies can reach Nash Equilibrium in every evaluation MG under the\nassumption of Lipschitz game on a sufficiently large latent space. When\ndeploying it at practical latent models with limited size, fast adaptation can\nbe achieved by leveraging the first-order gradient information.

However, the\nrobustness of the closed-loop Koopman MPC under modeling approximation errors\nand possible exogenous disturbances is still a crucial issue to be resolved.\nAiming at the above problem, this paper presents a robust tube-based MPC\nsolution with Koopman operators, i.e., r-KMPC, for nonlinear discrete-time\ndynamical systems with additive disturbances. The proposed controller is\ncomposed of a nominal MPC using a lifted Koopman model and an off-line\nnonlinear feedback policy.

However, with the\nconventional passive architecture, IRSs can only adjust the phase of the\nincident signals limiting the achievable beamforming gain. To fully unleash the\npotential of IRSs, in this paper, we consider a more general IRS architecture,\ni.e., active IRSs, which can adapt the phase and amplify the magnitude of the\nreflected incident signal simultaneously with the support of an additional\npower source. To realize green communication in active IRS-assisted multiuser\nsystems, we jointly optimize the reflection matrix at the IRS and the\nbeamforming vector at the base station (BS) for the minimization of the BS\ntransmit power. The resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as an\noptimization problem taking into account the maximum power budget of the active\nIRS and the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of the users. To handle the\nnon-convex design problem, we develop a novel and computationally efficient\nalgorithm based on the bilinear transformation and inner approximation methods.\nThe proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a locally optimal solution\nof the considered problem. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed scheme compared to the two baseline schemes. Moreover, the results\nunveil that deploying active IRSs is a promising approach to enhance the system\nperformance compared to conventional passive IRSs, especially when strong\ndirect links exist.",

    "title": "Evaluating Bayes Error Estimators on Read-World Datasets with FeeBee",
    "abstract": "The Bayes error rate (BER) is a fundamental concept in machine learning that\nquantifies the best possible accuracy any classifier can achieve on a fixed\nprobability distribution. Despite years of research on building estimators of\nlower and upper bounds for the BER, these were usually compared only on\nsynthetic datasets with known probability distributions, leaving two key\nquestions unanswered: (1) How well do they perform on real-world datasets?, and\n(2) How practical are they? Answering these is not trivial. Apart from the\nobvious challenge of an unknown BER for real-world datasets, there are two main\naspects any BER estimator needs to overcome in order to be applicable in\nreal-world settings: (1) the computational and sample complexity, and (2) the\nsensitivity and selection of hyper-parameters. In this work, we propose FeeBee,\nthe first principled framework for analyzing and comparing BER estimators on\nany modern real-world dataset with unknown probability distribution. We achieve\nthis by injecting a controlled amount of label noise and performing multiple\nevaluations on a series of different noise levels, supported by a theoretical\nresult which allows drawing conclusions about the evolution of the BER. By\nimplementing and analyzing 7 multi-class BER estimators on 6 commonly used\ndatasets of the computer vision and NLP domains, FeeBee allows a thorough study\nof these estimators, clearly identifying strengths and weaknesses of each,\nwhilst being easily deployable on any future BER estimator.",

    "abstract": "Description logics are a powerful tool for describing ontological knowledge\nbases. That is, they give a factual account of the world in terms of\nindividuals, concepts and relations. In the presence of uncertainty, such\nfactual accounts are not feasible, and a subjective or epistemic approach is\nrequired. Aleatoric description logic models uncertainty in the world as\naleatoric events, by the roll of the dice, where an agent has subjective\nbeliefs about the bias of these dice. This provides a subjective Bayesian\ndescription logic, where propositions and relations are assigned probabilities\naccording to what a rational agent would bet, given a configuration of possible\nindividuals and dice. Aleatoric description logic is shown to generalise the\ndescription logic ALC, and can be seen to describe a probability space of\ninterpretations of a restriction of ALC where all roles are functions. Several\ncomputational problems are considered and model-checking and consistency\nchecking algorithms are presented. Finally, aleatoric description logic is\nshown to be able to model learning, where agents are able to condition their\nbeliefs on the bias of dice according to observations.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving at intersections is one of the most complicated and\naccident-prone traffic scenarios, especially with mixed traffic participants\nsuch as vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians. The driving policy should make safe\ndecisions to handle the dynamic traffic conditions and meet the requirements of\non-board computation. However, most of the current researches focuses on\nsimplified intersections considering only the surrounding vehicles and\nidealized traffic lights. This paper improves the integrated decision and\ncontrol framework and develops a learning-based algorithm to deal with complex\nintersections with mixed traffic flows, which can not only take account of\nrealistic characteristics of traffic lights, but also learn a safe policy under\ndifferent safety constraints. We first consider different velocity models for\ngreen and red lights in the training process and use a finite state machine to\nhandle different modes of light transformation. Then we design different types\nof distance constraints for vehicles, traffic lights, pedestrians, bicycles\nrespectively and formulize the constrained optimal control problems (OCPs) to\nbe optimized. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) with value and policy\nnetworks is adopted to solve the series of OCPs. In order to verify the safety\nand efficiency of the proposed method, we design a multi-lane intersection with\nthe existence of large-scale mixed traffic participants and set practical\ntraffic light phases. The simulation results indicate that the trained decision\nand control policy can well balance safety and tracking performance. Compared\nwith model predictive control (MPC), the computational time is three orders of\nmagnitude lower.",

    "abstract": "Node injection attack on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is an emerging and\npractical attack scenario that the attacker injects malicious nodes rather than\nmodifying original nodes or edges to affect the performance of GNNs. However,\nexisting node injection attacks ignore extremely limited scenarios, namely the\ninjected nodes might be excessive such that they may be perceptible to the\ntarget GNN. In this paper, we focus on an extremely limited scenario of single\nnode injection evasion attack, i.e., the attacker is only allowed to inject one\nsingle node during the test phase to hurt GNN's performance. The discreteness\nof network structure and the coupling effect between network structure and node\nfeatures bring great challenges to this extremely limited scenario. We first\npropose an optimization-based method to explore the performance upper bound of\nsingle node injection evasion attack. Experimental results show that 100%,\n98.60%, and 94.98% nodes on three public datasets are successfully attacked\neven when only injecting one node with one edge, confirming the feasibility of\nsingle node injection evasion attack. However, such an optimization-based\nmethod needs to be re-optimized for each attack, which is computationally\nunbearable. To solve the dilemma, we further propose a Generalizable Node\nInjection Attack model, namely G-NIA, to improve the attack efficiency while\nensuring the attack performance.

    "title": "Unsupervised Monocular Depth Perception: Focusing on Moving Objects",
    "abstract": "As a flexible passive 3D sensing means, unsupervised learning of depth from\nmonocular videos is becoming an important research topic. It utilizes the\nphotometric errors between the target view and the synthesized views from its\nadjacent source views as the loss instead of the difference from the ground\ntruth. Occlusion and scene dynamics in real-world scenes still adversely affect\nthe learning, despite significant progress made recently. In this paper, we\nshow that deliberately manipulating photometric errors can efficiently deal\nwith these difficulties better. We first propose an outlier masking technique\nthat considers the occluded or dynamic pixels as statistical outliers in the\nphotometric error map. With the outlier masking, the network learns the depth\nof objects that move in the opposite direction to the camera more accurately.\nTo the best of our knowledge, such cases have not been seriously considered in\nthe previous works, even though they pose a high risk in applications like\nautonomous driving. We also propose an efficient weighted multi-scale scheme to\nreduce the artifacts in the predicted depth maps. Extensive experiments on the\nKITTI dataset and additional experiments on the Cityscapes dataset have\nverified the proposed approach's effectiveness on depth or ego-motion\nestimation. Furthermore, for the first time, we evaluate the predicted depth on\nthe regions of dynamic objects and static background separately for both\nsupervised and unsupervised methods. The evaluation further verifies the\neffectiveness of our proposed technical approach and provides some interesting\nobservations that might inspire future research in this direction.",

Moreover, the SHACL specification does not define the semantics of\nrecursively-defined constraints, which led to several alternative recursive\nsemantics being proposed in the literature. The interaction between these\ndifferent semantics and important decision problems has not been investigated\nyet. In this article we provide a comprehensive study of the different features\nof SHACL, by providing a translation to a new first-order language, called SCL,\nthat precisely captures the semantics of SHACL. We also present MSCL, a\nsecond-order extension of SCL, which allows us to define, in a single formal\nlogic framework, the main recursive semantics of SHACL. Within this language we\nalso provide an effective treatment of filter constraints which are often\nneglected in the related literature. Using this logic we provide a detailed map\nof (un)decidability and complexity results for the satisfiability and\ncontainment decision problems for different SHACL fragments.

The developer feedback\nfrom our qualitative study and the observations from our quantitative\nexamination of existing repair tools point to actionable insights to drive\nprogram repair research.

Organized by a\nmultidisciplinary committee, Israel's research community was invited to offer\ninsights to COVID-19 policy challenges. The Datathon was designed to (1)\ndevelop operationalizable data-driven models to address COVID-19 health-policy\nchallenges and (2) build a community of researchers from academia, industry,\nand government and rebuild their trust in the government. Three specific\nchallenges were defined based on their relevance (significance, data\navailability, and potential to anonymize the data): immunization policies,\nspecial needs of the young population, and populations whose rate of compliance\nwith COVID-19 testing is low. The MoH team extracted diverse, reliable,\nup-to-date, and deidentified governmental datasets for each challenge. Secure\nremote-access research environments with relevant data science tools were set\non Amazon Web. The MoH screened the applicants and accepted around 80\nparticipants, teaming them to balance areas of expertise as well as represent\nall sectors of the community. One week following the event, anonymous surveys\nfor participants and mentors were distributed to assess overall usefulness and\npoints for improvement. The 48-hour Datathon and pre-event sessions included 18\nmultidisciplinary teams, mentored by 20 data scientists, 6 epidemiologists, 5\npresentation mentors, and 12 judges. The insights developed by the 3 winning\nteams are currently considered by the MoH as potential data science methods\nrelevant for national policies.

Previous works focus on improving the domain\nadaptability of region-based detectors, e.g., Faster-RCNN, through matching\ncross-domain instance-level features that are explicitly extracted from a\nregion proposal network (RPN). However, this is unsuitable for region-free\ndetectors such as single shot detector (SSD), which perform a dense prediction\nfrom all possible locations in an image and do not have the RPN to encode such\ninstance-level features. As a result, they fail to align important image\nregions and crucial instance-level features between the domains of region-free\ndetectors. In this work, we propose an adversarial module to strengthen the\ncross-domain matching of instance-level features for region-free detectors.\nFirstly, to emphasize the important regions of image, the DSEM learns to\npredict a transferable foreground enhancement mask that can be utilized to\nsuppress the background disturbance in an image. Secondly, considering that\nregion-free detectors recognize objects of different scales using multi-scale\nfeature maps, the DSEM encodes both multi-level semantic representations and\nmulti-instance spatial-contextual relationships across different domains.\nFinally, the DSEM is pluggable into different region-free detectors, ultimately\nachieving the densely semantic feature matching via adversarial learning.\nExtensive experiments have been conducted on PASCAL VOC, Clipart, Comic,\nWatercolor, and FoggyCityscape benchmarks, and their results well demonstrate\nthat the proposed approach not only improves the domain adaptability of\nregion-free detectors but also outperforms existing domain adaptive\nregion-based detectors under various domain shift settings.",

    "abstract": "By adapting Salomaa's complete proof system for equality of regular\nexpressions under the language semantics, Milner (1984) formulated a sound\nproof system for bisimilarity of regular expressions under the process\ninterpretation he introduced. He asked whether this system is complete.\nProof-theoretic arguments attempting to show completeness of this equational\nsystem are complicated by the presence of a non-algebraic rule for solving\nfixed-point equations by using star iteration.\nWe characterize the derivational power that the fixed-point rule adds to the\npurely equational part $\\text{Mil$^{\\boldsymbol{-}}$}$ of Milner's system\n$\\text{$\\text{Mil}$}$: it corresponds to the power of coinductive proofs over\n$\\text{Mil$^{\\boldsymbol{-}}$}$ that have the form of finite process graphs\nwith the loop existence and elimination property $\\text{LEE}$. We define a\nvariant system $\\text{cMil}$ by replacing the fixed-point rule in $\\text{Mil}$\nwith a rule that permits $\\text{LEE}$-shaped circular derivations in\n$\\text{Mil$^{\\boldsymbol{-}}$}$ from previously derived equations as a premise.\nWith this rule alone we also define the variant system $\\text{CLC}$ for merely\ncombining $\\text{LEE}$-shaped coinductive proofs over\n$\\text{Mil$^{\\boldsymbol{-}}$}$. We show that both $\\text{cMil}$ and\n$\\text{CLC}$ have proof interpretations in $\\text{Mil}$, and vice versa. As\nthis correspondence links, in both directions, derivability in $\\text{Mil}$\nwith derivation trees of process graphs, it widens the space for graph-based\napproaches to finding a completeness proof of Milner's system.\nThis report is the extended version of a paper with the same title accepted\nfor CALCO 2021.",

However, an objective comparison between\npublished methods is difficult, since existing works use different datasets for\nevaluation and often compare against untuned baselines with default\nhyper-parameters. We design a benchmark for data-efficient image classification\nconsisting of six diverse datasets spanning various domains (e.g., natural\nimages, medical imagery, satellite data) and data types (RGB, grayscale,\nmultispectral). Using this benchmark, we re-evaluate the standard cross-entropy\nbaseline and eight methods for data-efficient deep learning published between\n2017 and 2021 at renowned venues. For a fair and realistic comparison, we\ncarefully tune the hyper-parameters of all methods on each dataset.\nSurprisingly, we find that tuning learning rate, weight decay, and batch size\non a separate validation split results in a highly competitive baseline, which\noutperforms all but one specialized method and performs competitively to the\nremaining one.",

    "abstract": "The scene graph generation (SGG) task aims to detect visual relationship\ntriplets, i.e., subject, predicate, object, in an image, providing a structural\nvision layout for scene understanding. However, current models are stuck in\ncommon predicates, e.g., \"on\" and \"at\", rather than informative ones, e.g.,\n\"standing on\" and \"looking at\", resulting in the loss of precise information\nand overall performance. If a model only uses \"stone on road\" rather than\n\"blocking\" to describe an image, it is easy to misunderstand the scene. We\nargue that this phenomenon is caused by two key imbalances between informative\npredicates and common ones, i.e., semantic space level imbalance and training\nsample level imbalance. To tackle this problem, we propose BA-SGG, a simple yet\neffective SGG framework based on balance adjustment but not the conventional\ndistribution fitting. It integrates two components: Semantic Adjustment (SA)\nand Balanced Predicate Learning (BPL), respectively for adjusting these\nimbalances. Benefited from the model-agnostic process, our method is easily\napplied to the state-of-the-art SGG models and significantly improves the SGG\nperformance. Our method achieves 14.3%, 8.0%, and 6.1% higher Mean Recall (mR)\nthan that of the Transformer model at three scene graph generation sub-tasks on\nVisual Genome, respectively.

We conduct a series of experiments on\nthree public abstractive text summarization datasets, and demonstrate the\nadvantages of the proposed metric in both improving the correlation with human\njudgments and the convenience of usage.

(2) All the summaries sum up each topic separately, thus\ncontaining the topic-level structure of the dialogue. We define tasks in CSDS\nas generating the overall summary and different role-oriented summaries for a\ngiven dialogue. Next, we compare various summarization methods on CSDS, and\nexperiment results show that existing methods are prone to generate redundant\nand incoherent summaries.

These UAV-enabled\nnetworks can meet several complex mission requirements and are seen as a\npotential enabler for many of the emerging use-cases in future communication\nnetworks. Such networks, however, are characterized by a highly dynamic and\nmobile environment with no guarantee of a central network infrastructure which\ncan cause both connectivity and security issues. While wireless mesh networks\nare envisioned as a solution for such scenarios, these networks come with their\nown challenges and security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we analyze the key\nsecurity and resilience issues resulting from the application of wireless mesh\nnetworks within UAV swarms. Specifically, we highlight the main challenges of\napplying current mesh technologies within the domain of UAV swarms and expose\nexisting vulnerabilities across the communication stack. Based on this\nanalysis, we present a security-focused architecture for UAV mesh\ncommunications. Finally, from the identification of these vulnerabilities, we\ndiscuss research opportunities posed by the unique challenges of UAV swarm\nconnectivity.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Internet of Things (IoTs) have brought about a surge\nof interest in indoor positioning for the purpose of providing reliable,\naccurate, and energy-efficient indoor navigation/localization systems. Ultra\nWide Band (UWB) technology has been emerged as a potential candidate to satisfy\nthe aforementioned requirements. Although UWB technology can enhance the\naccuracy of indoor positioning due to the use of a wide-frequency spectrum,\nthere are key challenges ahead for its efficient implementation. On the one\nhand, achieving high precision in positioning relies on the\nidentification/mitigation Non Line of Sight (NLoS) links, leading to a\nsignificant increase in the complexity of the localization framework. On the\nother hand, UWB beacons have a limited battery life, which is especially\nproblematic in practical circumstances with certain beacons located in\nstrategic positions. To address these challenges, we introduce an efficient\nnode selection framework to enhance the location accuracy without using complex\nNLoS mitigation methods, while maintaining a balance between the remaining\nbattery life of UWB beacons. Referred to as the Deep Q-Learning\nEnergy-optimized LoS/NLoS (DQLEL) UWB node selection framework, the mobile user\nis autonomously trained to determine the optimal pair of UWB beacons to be\nlocalized based on the 2-D Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) framework. The\neffectiveness of the proposed DQLEL framework is evaluated in terms of the link\ncondition, the deviation of the remaining battery life of UWB beacons, location\nerror, and cumulative rewards. Based on the simulation results, the proposed\nDQLEL framework significantly outperformed its counterparts across the\naforementioned aspects.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, Internet of Video Things (IoVT) grows rapidly in terms of quantity\nand computation demands. In spite of the higher local computation capability on\nvisual processing compared with conventional Internet of Things devices, IoVT\ndevices need to offload partial visual processing tasks to the mobile edge\ncomputing (MEC) server wirelessly due to its larger computation demands.\nHowever, visual processing task offloading is limited by uplink throughput and\ncomputation capability of the MEC server. To break through these limitations, a\nnovel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted IoVT framework with\nmultiple MEC servers is proposed, where NOMA is exploited to improve uplink\nthroughput and MEC servers are co-located with base stations to provide enough\ncomputation capability for offloading. In the proposed framework, the\nassociation strategy, uplink visual data transmission assisted by NOMA and\ndivision of the visual processing tasks as well as computation resource\nallocation at the MEC servers are jointly optimized to minimize the total delay\nof all visual processing tasks, while meeting the delay requirements of all\nIoVT devices. Simulation results demonstrate that significant performance gains\ncan be achieved by proposed joint optimization with NOMA transmission and\nmulti-MEC offloading in the heterogeneous IoVT network.",

    "abstract": "Achieving significant performance gains both in terms of system throughput\nand massive connectivity, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been\nconsidered as a very promising candidate for future wireless communications\ntechnologies. It has already received serious consideration for implementation\nin the fifth generation (5G) and beyond wireless communication systems.

However, in order to take advantage of\nthe benefits, NOMA provides in an optimal manner, power allocation needs to be\nconsidered to maximise the system throughput. This problem is non-deterministic\npolynomial-time (NP)-hard which is mainly why the use of deep learning\ntechniques for power allocation is required.

    "abstract": "This article offers a new perspective for the mechanics of solids using\nmoving Cartan's frame, specifically discussing a mixed variational principle in\nnon-linear elasticity. We treat quantities defined on the co-tangent bundles of\nreference and deformed configurations as additional unknowns. Such a treatment\ninvites compatibility of the fields with base-space (configurations of the\nbody), so that the configuration can be realised as a subset of the Euclidean\nspace. We first rewrite the metric and connection using differential forms,\nwhich are further utilised to write the deformation gradient and Cauchy-Green\ndeformation tensor in terms of frame and co-frame fields. The geometric\nunderstanding of stress as a co-vector valued 2-form fits squarely within our\noverall program. We show that, for a hyperelastic solid, an equation similar to\nthe Doyle-Erciksen formula may be written for the co-vector part of stress.\nUsing these, we write a mixed energy functional in terms of differential forms,\nwhose extremum leads to the compatibility of deformation, constitutive rules\nand equations of equilibrium. Finite element exterior calculus is then utilised\nto construct a finite dimensional approximation for the differential forms\nappearing in the variational principle. These approximations are then used to\nconstruct a discrete functional which is then numerically extremised. This\ndiscertization leads to a mixed method as it uses independent approximations\nfor differential forms related to stress and deformation gradient. The mixed\nvariational principle is then specialized for 2D case, whose discrete\napproximation is applied to problems in nonlinear elasticity. An important\nfeature of our FE technique is the lack of additional stabilization. From the\nnumerical study, it is found that the present discretization also does not\nsuffer form locking and related convergence issues.",

    "abstract": "Parallel server system is a stochastic processing network widely studied in\nthe context of manufacturing, supply chain, ride-hailing, call centers, etc.\nHeterogeneous customers arrive into the system and only a subset of servers can\nserve any given customer type depending on the flexibility graph. As the\nflexibility can be overlapping, scheduling decisions must be made to minimize\nthe delay experienced by the customers. Exact analysis of delay is not possible\nand so, we consider the heavy traffic asymptotic regime, wherein the arrival\nrate is loaded up to approach the service rate. We consider the general case\nwhen the so called complete resource pooling (CRP) is not satisfied. Recent\nwork established that when the MaxWeight scheduling algorithm is used, the\nstate space collapses (SSC) into a lower dimensional sub-space. Building upon\nthis result, the goal of our paper is to design, analyze and improve the\nflexibility graph such that the dimension of SSC is minimized. First, we\ncharacterize the SSC and thus, the mean delay performance in terms of a given\nflexibility graph. Using this result, we next study the problem of designing\nthe sparsest flexibility graph that leads to a target SSC dimension. We\nestablish a necessary and sufficient condition on the number of edges required,\nand provide an algorithm to construct such a graph. Finally, we consider the\nquestion of how to improve a given flexibility graph if one is allowed to add a\nsingle additional edge. The above results are obtained by identifying a\nconnection to the transportation polytope, and adding to a long line of\nliterature, we develop new theoretical results for it. These results are\ntherefore of independent interest. In particular, we obtain new results on the\nextreme points and the so-called support graphs of the transportation polytope.",

    "abstract": "As the number of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) increases, the need for\nperforming on-premises tasks within hospitals or medical centers also\nincreases. Many healthcare organizations are progressively embracing or\nadopting an edge computing paradigm such that computationally intensive tasks\ncan be processed at the edge of the network in order to avoid latency and\nnetwork reliability issues associated with offloading tasks to the cloud. The\nproblem, however, hospitals or medical centers may not be equipped with\nsufficient computing resources that can process advanced ML or AI tasks\nefficiently. In addition, some tasks may not be easily offloadable or contain\nsensitive patient healthcare data which increases the risks of having malicious\nattacks. In this paper, we extend our Edgify resource provisioning framework to\nconsider the task offloading of healthcare applications' involving patients'\ndata as a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) process that often involves\nmultiple conflicting criteria (e.g. data privacy risks, costs, latency, network\nreliability, among others). We evaluate our proposed framework through a number\nof experiments which demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of employing\nour optimization approach within hospitals or medical centers.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of power control for a wireless\nnetwork with an arbitrarily time-varying topology, including the possible\naddition or removal of nodes. A data-driven design methodology that leverages\ngraph neural networks (GNNs) is adopted in order to efficiently parametrize the\npower control policy mapping the channel state information (CSI) to transmit\npowers. The specific GNN architecture, known as random edge GNN (REGNN),\ndefines a non-linear graph convolutional filter whose spatial weights are tied\nto the channel coefficients. While prior work assumed a joint training approach\nwhereby the REGNN-based policy is shared across all topologies, this paper\ntargets adaptation of the power control policy based on limited CSI data\nregarding the current topology. To this end, we propose both black-box and\nmodular meta-learning techniques. Black-box meta-learning optimizes a\ngeneral-purpose adaptation procedure via (stochastic) gradient descent, while\nmodular meta-learning finds a set of reusable modules that can form components\nof a solution for any new network topology. Numerical results validate the\nbenefits of meta-learning for power control problems over joint training\nschemes, and demonstrate the advantages of modular meta-learning when data\navailability is extremely limited.",

    "abstract": "This report presents some early results on code generation targeting tensor\ncores on NVIDIA GPUs using the MLIR compiler infrastructure. The\nstate-of-the-art in high-performance deep learning today is primarily driven by\nmanually optimized highly tuned libraries. The approach to develop such\nlibraries is often not modular or reusable to the same extent that compiler\ninfrastructure like LLVM is. Manual optimization typically does not use a\nstandard intermediate representation (IR), although the optimizations performed\ncan be encoded as a sequence of transformation steps and customized passes on\nan IR. Hand tuning may also miss exploration of design points only reachable\neasily by automatic code generation. We believe that until the recent\nintroduction of MLIR (Multi-level intermediate representation), IR\ninfrastructure was not geared to tackle the problem of automatic generation of\ndomain-specific libraries in an effective manner. In particular, it was hard to\nrepresent and transform compute abstractions at high, middle, and low levels\nusing a single IR.\nWith suitable abstractions in MLIR, we build an experimental lowering\npipeline that is able to automatically generate code for matrix-matrix\nmultiplication on NVIDIA GPUs targeting its tensor cores. On a set of problem\nsizes we evaluated, initial performance results show that we are able to attain\nperformance that is 95-119% and 80-160% of CuBLAS for FP32 and FP16 accumulate\nrespectively on NVIDIA's Ampere microarchitecture-based Geforce 3090 RTX.

Specifically, we consider a multiple-input-single-output emulator that\nuses a DenseNet encoder-decoder architecture and is trained to predict\ninterannual variations of sea surface temperature (SST) at 1, 6, and 9 month\nlead times using the preceding 36 months of (appropriately filtered) SST data.\nFirst, feature importance methods are employed for individual predictions to\nspatio-temporally identify input features that are important for model\nprediction at chosen geographical regions and chosen prediction lead times. In\na second step, we also examine the behavior of feature importance in a\ngeneralized sense by considering an aggregation of the importance heatmaps over\ntraining samples. We find that: 1) the climate emulator's prediction at any\ngeographical location depends dominantly on a small neighborhood around it; 2)\nthe longer the prediction lead time, the further back the \"importance\" extends;\nand 3) to leading order, the temporal decay of \"importance\" is independent of\ngeographical location. An ablation experiment is adopted to verify the\nfindings. From the perspective of climate dynamics, these findings suggest a\ndominant role for local processes and a negligible role for remote\nteleconnections at the spatial and temporal scales we consider.

State-of-the-art solutions split the problem into a\nplanning task - where a global, time-optimal trajectory is generated - and a\ncontrol task - where this trajectory is accurately tracked. However, at the\ncurrent state, generating a time-optimal trajectory that takes the full\nquadrotor model into account is computationally demanding (in the order of\nminutes or even hours). This is detrimental for replanning in presence of\ndisturbances. We overcome this issue by solving the time-optimal planning and\ncontrol problems concurrently via Model Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC).\nOur MPCC optimally selects the future states of the platform at runtime, while\nmaximizing the progress along the reference path and minimizing the distance to\nit. We show that, even when tracking simplified trajectories, the proposed MPCC\nresults in a path that approaches the true time-optimal one, and which can be\ngenerated in real-time.

    "abstract": "Center touchscreens are the main HMI (Human-Machine Interface) between the\ndriver and the vehicle. They are becoming, larger, increasingly complex and\nreplace functions that could previously be controlled using haptic interfaces.\nTo ensure that touchscreen HMI can be operated safely, they are subject to\nstrict regulations and elaborate test protocols. Those methods and user trials\nrequire fully functional prototypes and are expensive and time-consuming.\nTherefore it is desirable to estimate the workload of specific interfaces or\ninteraction sequences as early as possible in the development process. To\naddress this problem, we envision a model-based approach that, based on the\ncombination of user interactions and UI elements, can predict the secondary\ntask load of the driver when interacting with the center screen. In this work,\nwe present our current status, preliminary results, and our vision for a\nmodel-based system build upon large-scale natural driving data.",

    "abstract": "The convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches have shown great\nsuccess for speaker verification (SV) tasks, where modeling long temporal\ncontext and reducing information loss of speaker characteristics are two\nimportant challenges significantly affecting the verification performance.\nPrevious works have introduced dilated convolution and multi-scale aggregation\nmethods to address above challenges. However, such methods are also hard to\nmake full use of some valuable information, which make it difficult to\nsubstantially improve the verification performance. To address above issues, we\nconstruct a novel CNN-based architecture for SV, called RSKNet-MTSP, where a\nresidual selective kernel block (RSKBlock) and a multiple time-scale statistics\npooling (MTSP) module are first proposed. The RSKNet-MTSP can capture both long\ntemporal context and neighbouring information, and gather more\nspeaker-discriminative information from multi-scale features. In order to\ndesign a portable model for real applications with limited resources, we then\npresent a lightweight version of RSKNet-MTSP, namely RSKNet-MTSP-L, which\nemploys a combination technique associating the depthwise separable\nconvolutions with low-rank factorization of weight matrices. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on two public SV datasets, VoxCeleb and Speaker in\nthe Wild (SITW). The results demonstrate that 1) RSKNet-MTSP outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art deep embedding architectures by at least 9%-26% in all test\nsets. 2) RSKNet-MTSP-L achieves competitive performance compared with baseline\nmodels with 17%-39% less network parameters. The ablation experiments further\nillustrate that our proposed approaches can achieve substantial improvement\nover prior methods.",

    "title": "Equine Pain Behavior Classification via Self-Supervised Disentangled  Pose Representation",
    "abstract": "Timely detection of horse pain is important for equine welfare. Horses\nexpress pain through their facial and body behavior, but may hide signs of pain\nfrom unfamiliar human observers. In addition, collecting visual data with\ndetailed annotation of horse behavior and pain state is both cumbersome and not\nscalable. Consequently, a pragmatic equine pain classification system would use\nvideo of the unobserved horse and weak labels. This paper proposes such a\nmethod for equine pain classification by using multi-view surveillance video\nfootage of unobserved horses with induced orthopaedic pain, with temporally\nsparse video level pain labels. To ensure that pain is learned from horse body\nlanguage alone, we first train a self-supervised generative model to\ndisentangle horse pose from its appearance and background before using the\ndisentangled horse pose latent representation for pain classification. To make\nbest use of the pain labels, we develop a novel loss that formulates pain\nclassification as a multi-instance learning problem. Our method achieves pain\nclassification accuracy better than human expert performance with 60% accuracy.\nThe learned latent horse pose representation is shown to be viewpoint\ncovariant, and disentangled from horse appearance. Qualitative analysis of pain\nclassified segments shows correspondence between the pain symptoms identified\nby our model, and equine pain scales used in veterinary practice.",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are predominantly evaluated by\ncomparing their relative performance on a large suite of tasks. Most published\nresults on deep RL benchmarks compare point estimates of aggregate performance\nsuch as mean and median scores across tasks, ignoring the statistical\nuncertainty implied by the use of a finite number of training runs. Beginning\nwith the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), the shift towards\ncomputationally-demanding benchmarks has led to the practice of evaluating only\na small number of runs per task, exacerbating the statistical uncertainty in\npoint estimates. In this paper, we argue that reliable evaluation in the few\nrun deep RL regime cannot ignore the uncertainty in results without running the\nrisk of slowing down progress in the field. We illustrate this point using a\ncase study on the Atari 100k benchmark, where we find substantial discrepancies\nbetween conclusions drawn from point estimates alone versus a more thorough\nstatistical analysis. With the aim of increasing the field's confidence in\nreported results with a handful of runs, we advocate for reporting interval\nestimates of aggregate performance and propose performance profiles to account\nfor the variability in results, as well as present more robust and efficient\naggregate metrics, such as interquartile mean scores, to achieve small\nuncertainty in results. Using such statistical tools, we scrutinize performance\nevaluations of existing algorithms on other widely used RL benchmarks including\nthe ALE, Procgen, and the DeepMind Control Suite, again revealing discrepancies\nin prior comparisons. Our findings call for a change in how we evaluate\nperformance in deep RL, for which we present a more rigorous evaluation\nmethodology, accompanied with an open-source library rliable, to prevent\nunreliable results from stagnating the field.",

However, their capabilities are intrinsically\nlimited to the imagination of the designer and consequently lack\ngeneralizability to initially unconsidered situations. This makes deep\nreinforcement learning especially interesting, as these algorithms promise a\nself-learning system only relying on feedback from the environment. Having the\nsystem itself search for an optimal solution brings the benefit of great\ngeneralization or even constant improvement when life-long learning is\naddressed. In this paper, we address robot navigation in continuous action\nspace using deep hierarchical reinforcement learning without including the\ntarget location in the state representation. Our agent self-assigns internal\ngoals and learns to extract reasonable waypoints to reach the desired target\nposition only based on local sensor data.

    "abstract": "We introduce fundamental bounds on achievable cumulative rate distribution\nfunctions (CRDF) to characterize a sequential encoding process that ensures\nlossless or lossy reconstruction subject to an average distortion criterion\nusing a non-causal decoder. The CRDF describes the rate resources spent\nsequentially to compress the sequence. We also include a security constraint\nthat affects the set of achievable CRDF. The information leakage is defined\nsequentially based on the mutual information between the source and its\ncompressed representation, as it evolves. To characterize the security\nconstraints, we introduce the concept of cumulative leakage distribution\nfunctions (CLF), which determines the allowed information leakage as\ndistributed over encoded sub-blocks. Utilizing tools from majorization theory,\nwe derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the achievable CRDF for a\ngiven independent and identically distributed (IID) source and CLF. One primary\nresult of this paper is that the concave-hull of the CRDF characterizes the\noptimal achievable rate distribution.",

In the first stage,\nthe Cascade Mask R-CNN model is applied directly to localize all category\nblocks of the documents. In the second stage, the deep visual, shallow visual,\nand text features are extracted for fusion to identify the category blocks of\ndocuments. As a result, we strengthen the classification power of different\ncategory blocks based on the existing localization technique.

These models, in which states represent features\nof the web application and transitions represent reachability relationships,\ncan be used for several model-based testing tasks, such as test case\ngeneration.

Thus, the\ncommunication cost in federated learning can be quite heavy. In this paper, we\npropose a communication efficient federated learning method based on knowledge\ndistillation. Instead of directly communicating the large models between\nclients and server, we propose an adaptive mutual distillation framework to\nreciprocally learn a student and a teacher model on each client, where only the\nstudent model is shared by different clients and updated collaboratively to\nreduce the communication cost. Both the teacher and student on each client are\nlearned on its local data and the knowledge distilled from each other, where\ntheir distillation intensities are controlled by their prediction quality.

In certain blockchains, light nodes are vulnerable to\na data availability (DA) attack where a malicious node makes the light nodes\naccept an invalid block by hiding the invalid portion of the block from the\nnodes in the system. Recently, a technique based on LDPC codes called Coded\nMerkle Tree was proposed by Yu et al. that enables light nodes to detect a DA\nattack by randomly requesting/sampling portions of the block from the malicious\nnode. However, light nodes fail to detect a DA attack with high probability if\na malicious node hides a small stopping set of the LDPC code. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that a suitable co-design of specialized LDPC codes and the light\nnode sampling strategy leads to a high probability of detection of DA attacks.\nWe consider different adversary models based on their computational\ncapabilities of finding stopping sets. For the different adversary models, we\nprovide new specialized LDPC code constructions and coupled light node sampling\nstrategies and demonstrate that they lead to a higher probability of detection\nof DA attacks compared to approaches proposed in earlier literature.",

This is due to the existence\nof worst case instances which force these algorithms to explore a large portion\nof the tree.\nAs an attempt to overcome this barrier, we propose a strategy iteration\nframework which can be applied on any universal tree. It is at least as fast as\nits value iteration counterparts, while allowing one to take bigger leaps in\nthe universal tree. Value iteration - asymptotically the fastest known\nalgorithm for parity games - is a repeated application of operators associated\nwith arcs in the game graph to obtain the least fixed point. Our main technical\ncontribution is an efficient method for computing the least fixed point of\noperators associated with arcs in a strategy subgraph. This is achieved via a\ncareful adaptation of shortest path algorithms to the setting of ordered trees.\nBy plugging in the universal tree of Jurdzi\\'nski and Lazi\\'c (2017), or the\nStrahler universal tree of Daviaud et al. (2020), we obtain instantiations of\nthe general framework that take time $O(mn^2\\log n\\log d)$ and $O(mn^2\\log^3 n\n\\log d)$ respectively per iteration.",

    "abstract": "Most existing multiobjetive evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) implicitly assume\nthat each objective function can be evaluated within the same period of time.\nTypically. this is untenable in many real-world optimization scenarios where\nevaluation of different objectives involves different computer simulations or\nphysical experiments with distinct time complexity. To address this issue, a\ntransfer learning scheme based on surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms\n(SAEAs) is proposed, in which a co-surrogate is adopted to model the functional\nrelationship between the fast and slow objective functions and a transferable\ninstance selection method is introduced to acquire useful knowledge from the\nsearch process of the fast objective. Our experimental results on DTLZ and UF\ntest suites demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is competitive for solving\nbi-objective optimization where objectives have non-uniform evaluation times.",

Bubbling operations enable\nrecursive generalization in the learned grammar. We evaluate Arvada against\nGLADE and find it achieves on average increases of 4.98x in recall and 3.13x in\nF1 score, while incurring only a 1.27x slowdown and requiring only 0.87x as\nmany calls to the oracle.

    "abstract": "This paper presents Hire-MLP, a simple yet competitive vision MLP\narchitecture via hierarchical rearrangement. Previous vision MLPs like\nMLP-Mixer are not flexible for various image sizes and are inefficient to\ncapture spatial information by flattening the tokens. Hire-MLP innovates the\nexisting MLP-based models by proposing the idea of hierarchical rearrangement\nto aggregate the local and global spatial information while being versatile for\ndownstream tasks. Specifically, the inner-region rearrangement is designed to\ncapture local information inside a spatial region. Moreover, to enable\ninformation communication between different regions and capture global context,\nthe cross-region rearrangement is proposed to circularly shift all tokens along\nspatial directions. The proposed Hire-MLP architecture is built with simple\nchannel-mixing MLPs and rearrangement operations, thus enjoys high flexibility\nand inference speed. Experiments show that our Hire-MLP achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet-1K benchmark. In particular,\nHire-MLP achieves an 83.4\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, which surpasses\nprevious Transformer-based and MLP-based models with better trade-off for\naccuracy and throughput.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have emerged as the core enabler of many major\napplications on mobile devices. To achieve high accuracy, DNN models have\nbecome increasingly deep with hundreds or even thousands of operator layers,\nleading to high memory and computational requirements for inference. Operator\nfusion (or kernel/layer fusion) is key optimization in many state-of-the-art\nDNN execution frameworks, such as TensorFlow, TVM, and MNN. However, these\nframeworks usually adopt fusion approaches based on certain patterns that are\ntoo restrictive to cover the diversity of operators and layer connections.\nPolyhedral-based loop fusion techniques, on the other hand, work on a low-level\nview of the computation without operator-level information, and can also miss\npotential fusion opportunities. To address this challenge, this paper proposes\na novel and extensive loop fusion framework called DNNFusion. The basic idea of\nthis work is to work at an operator view of DNNs, but expand fusion\nopportunities by developing a classification of both individual operators and\ntheir combinations. In addition, DNNFusion includes 1) a novel\nmathematical-property-based graph rewriting framework to reduce evaluation\ncosts and facilitate subsequent operator fusion, 2) an integrated fusion plan\ngeneration that leverages the high-level analysis and accurate light-weight\nprofiling, and 3) additional optimizations during fusion code generation.\nDNNFusion is extensively evaluated on 15 DNN models with varied types of tasks,\nmodel sizes, and layer counts. The evaluation results demonstrate that\nDNNFusion finds up to 8.8x higher fusion opportunities, outperforms four\nstate-of-the-art DNN execution frameworks with 9.3x speedup. The memory\nrequirement reduction and speedups can enable the execution of many of the\ntarget models on mobile devices and even make them part of a real-time\napplication.",

    "abstract": "The Free-Energy-Principle (FEP) is an influential and controversial theory\nwhich postulates a deep and powerful connection between the stochastic\nthermodynamics of self-organization and learning through variational inference.\nSpecifically, it claims that any self-organizing system which can be\nstatistically separated from its environment, and which maintains itself at a\nnon-equilibrium steady state, can be construed as minimizing an\ninformation-theoretic functional -- the variational free energy -- and thus\nperforming variational Bayesian inference to infer the hidden state of its\nenvironment. This principle has also been applied extensively in neuroscience,\nand is beginning to make inroads in machine learning by spurring the\nconstruction of novel and powerful algorithms by which action, perception, and\nlearning can all be unified under a single objective. While its expansive and\noften grandiose claims have spurred significant debates in both philosophy and\ntheoretical neuroscience, the mathematical depth and lack of accessible\nintroductions and tutorials for the core claims of the theory have often\nprecluded a deep understanding within the literature. Here, we aim to provide a\nmathematically detailed, yet intuitive walk-through of the formulation and\ncentral claims of the FEP while also providing a discussion of the assumptions\nnecessary and potential limitations of the theory. Additionally, since the FEP\nis a still a living theory, subject to internal controversy, change, and\nrevision, we also present a detailed appendix highlighting and condensing\ncurrent perspectives as well as controversies about the nature, applicability,\nand the mathematical assumptions and formalisms underlying the FEP.",

    "abstract": "Training real-world neural network models to achieve high performance and\ngeneralizability typically requires a substantial amount of labeled data,\nspanning a broad range of variation. This data-labeling process can be both\nlabor and cost intensive. To achieve desirable predictive performance, a\ntrained model is typically applied into a domain where the data distribution is\nsimilar to the training dataset. However, for many agricultural machine\nlearning problems, training datasets are collected at a specific location,\nduring a specific period in time of the growing season. Since agricultural\nsystems exhibit substantial variability in terms of crop type, cultivar,\nmanagement, seasonal growth dynamics, lighting condition, sensor type, etc, a\nmodel trained from one dataset often does not generalize well across domains.\nTo enable more data efficient and generalizable neural network models in\nagriculture, we propose a method that generates photorealistic agricultural\nimages from a synthetic 3D crop model domain into real world crop domains. The\nmethod uses a semantically constrained GAN (generative adversarial network) to\npreserve the fruit position and geometry. We observe that a baseline CycleGAN\nmethod generates visually realistic target domain images but does not preserve\nfruit position information while our method maintains fruit positions well.\nImage generation results in vineyard grape day and night images show the visual\noutputs of our network are much better compared to a baseline network.\nIncremental training experiments in vineyard grape detection tasks show that\nthe images generated from our method can significantly speed the domain\nadaption process, increase performance for a given number of labeled images\n(i.e. data efficiency), and decrease labeling requirements.",

A dataset of city-scale vehicular continuous\ntrajectories featuring the finest resolution and integrity, as known as the\nholographic traffic data, would be a breakthrough, for it could reproduce every\ndetail of the traffic flow evolution and reveal the personal mobility pattern\nwithin the city. Due to the high coverage of Automatic Vehicle Identification\n(AVI) devices in Xuancheng city, we constructed one-month continuous\ntrajectories of daily 80,000 vehicles in the city with accurate intersection\npassing time and no travel path estimation bias. With such holographic traffic\ndata, it is possible to reproduce every detail of the traffic flow evolution.\nWe presented a set of traffic flow data based on the holographic trajectories\nresampling, covering the whole 482 road segments in the city round the clock,\nincluding stationary average speed and flow data of 5-minute intervals and\ndynamic floating car data.",

Stateful logic\ntechniques such as IMPLY, MAGIC and FELIX can perform logic gates within\nmemristive crossbar arrays with massive parallelism. Multiplication via\nstateful logic is an active field of research due to the wide implications.\nRecently, RIME has become the state-of-the-art algorithm for stateful\nsingle-row multiplication by using memristive partitions, reducing the latency\nof the previous state-of-the-art by 5.1x. In this paper, we begin by proposing\nnovel partition-based computation techniques for broadcasting and shifting\ndata. Then, we design an in-memory multiplication algorithm based on the\ncarry-save add-shift (CSAS) technique. Finally, we detail specific logic\noptimizations to the algorithm that further reduce latency. These contributions\nconstitute MultPIM, a multiplier that reduces state-of-the-art time complexity\nfrom quadratic to linear-log. For 32-bit numbers, MultPIM improves latency by\nan additional 3.8x over RIME, while even slightly reducing area overhead.\nFurthermore, we optimize MultPIM for full-precision matrix-vector\nmultiplication and demonstrate 22.0x latency improvement over FloatPIM\nmatrix-vector multiplication.",

These network systems integrated with neurons and\nsynapses provide computational efficiency by mimicking the human brain. It is\ndesired to incorporate the biological neuronal dynamics, including complex\nspiking patterns which represent diverse brain activities within the neural\nnetworks. Earlier hardware realization of neurons was (1) area intensive\nbecause of large capacitors in the circuit design, (2) neuronal spiking\npatterns were demonstrated with clocked neurons at the device level. To achieve\nmore realistic biological neuron spiking behavior, emerging memristive devices\nare considered promising alternatives. In this paper, we propose, PrMnO3(PMO)\n-RRAM device-based neuron. The voltage-controlled electrothermal timescales of\nthe compact PMO RRAM device replace the electrical timescales of charging a\nlarge capacitor. The electrothermal timescale is used to implement an\nintegration block with multiple voltage-controlled timescales coupled with a\nrefractory block to generate biological neuronal dynamics.

Approaches based on click-level annotations have therefore\nattracted increasing attention due to their superior trade-off between\nsupervision and annotation cost. In this paper, we propose seminar learning, a\nnew learning paradigm for semantic segmentation with click-level supervision.\nThe fundamental rationale of seminar learning is to leverage the knowledge from\ndifferent networks to compensate for insufficient information provided in\nclick-level annotations. Mimicking a seminar, our seminar learning involves a\nteacher-student and a student-student module, where a student can learn from\nboth skillful teachers and other students. The teacher-student module uses a\nteacher network based on the exponential moving average to guide the training\nof the student network. In the student-student module, heterogeneous\npseudo-labels are proposed to bridge the transfer of knowledge among students\nto enhance each other's performance. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of seminar learning, which achieves the new state-of-the-art\nperformance of 72.51% (mIOU), surpassing previous methods by a large margin of\nup to 16.88% on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset.",

The UFLoss\nprovides instance-level discrimination by mapping similar instances to similar\nlow-dimensional feature vectors and is trained without any human annotation. By\nadding an additional loss function on the low-dimensional feature space during\ntraining, the reconstruction frameworks from under-sampled or corrupted data\ncan reproduce more realistic images that are closer to the original with finer\ntextures, sharper edges, and improved overall image quality. The performance of\nthe proposed UFLoss is demonstrated on unrolled networks for accelerated 2D and\n3D knee MRI reconstruction with retrospective under-sampling. Quantitative\nmetrics including NRMSE, SSIM, and our proposed UFLoss were used to evaluate\nthe performance of the proposed method and compare it with others.\nResults: In-vivo experiments indicate that adding the UFLoss encourages\nsharper edges and more faithful contrasts compared to traditional and\nlearning-based methods with pure l2 loss. More detailed textures can be seen in\nboth 2D and 3D knee MR images. Quantitative results indicate that\nreconstruction with UFLoss can provide comparable NRMSE and a higher SSIM while\nachieving a much lower UFLoss value.\nConclusion: We present UFLoss, a patch-based unsupervised learned feature\nloss, which allows the training of DL-based reconstruction to obtain more\ndetailed texture, finer features, and sharper edges with higher overall image\nquality under DL-based reconstruction frameworks.",

Applying QSAR modeling to DEL data\ncan facilitate the selection of compounds for off-DNA synthesis and evaluation.\nSuch a combined approach has been shown recently by training binary classifiers\nto learn DEL enrichments of aggregated \"disynthons\" to accommodate the sparse\nand noisy nature of DEL data. However, a binary classifier cannot distinguish\nbetween different levels of enrichment, and information is potentially lost\nduring disynthon aggregation. Here, we demonstrate a regression approach to\nlearning DEL enrichments of individual molecules using a custom negative\nlog-likelihood loss function that effectively denoises DEL data and introduces\nopportunities for visualization of learned structure-activity relationships\n(SAR). Our approach explicitly models the Poisson statistics of the sequencing\nprocess used in the DEL experimental workflow under a frequentist view.

Due to the\ntreatment of uncertainty in the data through the negative log-likelihood loss\nfunction, the models can ignore low-confidence outliers. While our approach\ndoes not demonstrate a benefit for extrapolation to novel structures, we expect\nour denoising and visualization pipeline to be useful in identifying SAR trends\nand enriched pharmacophores in DEL data.

Here we\ndevise a machine learning method, Gaussian mixture variational autoencoder\n(GMVAE) that can simultaneously perform dimensionality reduction and clustering\nof biomolecular conformations in an unsupervised way. We show that GMVAE can\nlearn a reduced representation of the free energy landscape of protein folding\nwith highly separated clusters that correspond to the metastable states during\nfolding. Since GMVAE uses a mixture of Gaussians as the prior, it can directly\nacknowledge the multi-basin nature of protein folding free-energy landscape. To\nmake the model end-to-end differentialble, we use a Gumbel-softmax\ndistribution. We test the model on three long-timescale protein folding\ntrajectories and show that GMVAE embedding resembles the folding funnel with\nfolded states down the funnel and unfolded states outer in the funnel path.\nAdditionally, we show that the latent space of GMVAE can be used for kinetic\nanalysis and Markov state models built on this embedding produce folding and\nunfolding timescales that are in close agreement with other rigorous dynamical\nembeddings such as time independent component analysis (TICA).",

We establish posterior contraction\nrates with respect to a family of Bochner norms as the number of data tend to\ninfinity and derive related lower bounds on the estimation error. In the large\ndata limit, we also provide asymptotic convergence rates of suitably defined\nexcess risk and generalization gap functionals associated with the posterior\nmean point estimator. In doing so, we connect the posterior consistency results\nto nonparametric learning theory. Furthermore, these convergence rates\nhighlight and quantify the difficulty of learning unbounded linear operators in\ncomparison with the learning of bounded or compact ones. Numerical experiments\nconfirm the theory and demonstrate that similar conclusions may be expected in\nmore general problem settings.",

Linguists who work to preserve a language's phonetic and\nphonological structure can spend hours transcribing each minute of speech from\nnative speakers. To address this problem in the context of Ladin, our paper\npresents the first analysis of speech representations and machine learning\nmodels for classifying 32 phonemes of Ladin. We experimented with a novel\ndataset of the Fascian dialect of Ladin, collected from native speakers in\nItaly. We created frame-level and segment-level speech feature extraction\napproaches and conducted extensive experiments with 8 different classifiers\ntrained on 9 different speech representations. Our speech representations\nranged from traditional features (MFCC, LPC) to features learned with deep\nneural network models (autoencoders, LSTM autoencoders, and WaveNet). Our\nhighest-performing classifier, trained on MFCC representations of speech\nsignals, achieved an 86% average accuracy across all Ladin phonemes.

Various SCI systems have been built in recent\nyears to capture data such as high-speed videos, hyperspectral images, and the\nstate-of-the-art reconstruction is obtained by the deep neural networks.\nHowever, most of these networks are trained in an end-to-end manner by a large\namount of corpus with sometimes simulated ground truth, measurement pairs.

Extensive synthetic and real data results show that the\nproposed algorithm without training is capable of achieving competitive results\nto the training based networks.

The radio number of $G$, denoted by\n$rn(G)$, is the smallest $t$ such that $G$ admits a radio labeling with\n$t=\\max\\{|f(v)-f(u)|: v, u \\in V(G)\\}$. A block graph is a graph such that each\nblock (induced maximal 2-connected subgraph) is a complete graph. In this\npaper, a lower bound for the radio number of block graphs is established. The\nblock graph which achieves this bound is called a lower bound block graph. We\nprove three necessary and sufficient conditions for lower bound block graphs.\nMoreover, we give three sufficient conditions for a graph to be a lower bound\nblock graph. Applying the established bound and conditions, we show that\nseveral families of block graphs are lower bound block graphs, including the\nlevel-wise regular block graphs and the extended star of blocks. The line graph\nof a graph $G(V,E)$ has $E(G)$ as the vertex set, where two vertices are\nadjacent if they are incident edges in $G$. We extend our results to trees as\ntrees and its line graphs are block graphs. We prove that if a tree is a lower\nbound block graph then, under certain conditions, its line graph is also a\nlower bound block graph, and vice versa. Consequently, we show that the line\ngraphs of many known lower bound trees, excluding paths, are lower bound block\ngraphs.",

To this\naim, in this paper we first show that the steady-state transfer function of a\nlinear system can be computed directly from control experiments, bypassing\nexplicit model identification.

A distinguishing feature of our methods is that they do\nnot require any knowledge of the system dynamics, disturbance terms, or their\ndistributions.

So far, efforts at open set classification have largely relied on the\nutilization of signal samples captured from a known set of unauthorized\ntransmitters to aid the classifier learn unauthorized transmitter fingerprints.\nSince acquiring new transmitters to use as known transmitters is highly\nexpensive, we propose to use generative deep learning methods to emulate\nunauthorized signal samples for the augmentation of training datasets.

Therefore, the microscopic images of cells tend to have low image\nquality but these images are not good for semantic segmentation. Here we\npropose a method to translate an input image to the images that are easy to\nrecognize by deep learning. The proposed method consists of two deep neural\nnetworks. The first network is the usual training for semantic segmentation,\nand penultimate feature maps of the first network are used as filters to\ntranslate an input image to the images that emphasize each class. This is the\nautomatic preprocessing and translated cell images are easily classified. The\ninput cell image with low quality is translated by the feature maps in the\nfirst network, and the translated images are fed into the second network for\nsemantic segmentation. Since the outputs of the second network are multiple\nsegmentation results, we conduct the weighted ensemble of those segmentation\nimages. Two networks are trained by end-to-end manner, and we do not need to\nprepare images with high quality for the translation. We confirmed that our\nproposed method can translate cell images with low quality to the images that\nare easy to segment, and segmentation accuracy has improved using the weighted\nensemble learning.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical behavior of inelastic materials with microstructure is very\ncomplex and hard to grasp with heuristic, empirical constitutive models. For\nthis purpose, multiscale, homogenization approaches are often used for\nperforming reliable, accurate predictions of the macroscopic mechanical\nbehavior of microstructured solids. Nevertheless, the calculation cost of such\napproaches is extremely high and prohibitive for real-scale applications\ninvolving inelastic materials. Recently, data-driven approaches based on deep\nlearning have risen as a promising alternative to replace ad-hoc constitutive\nlaws and speed-up multiscale numerical methods. However, such approaches lack a\nrigorous frame based on the laws of physics. As a result, their application to\nmodel materials with complex microstructure in inelasticity is not yet\nestablished. Here, we propose Thermodynamics-based Artificial Neural Networks\n(TANN) for the constitutive modeling of materials with inelastic and complex\nmicrostructure. Our approach integrates thermodynamics-aware dimensionality\nreduction techniques and deep neural networks to identify the constitutive laws\nand the internal state variables of complex inelastic materials. The ability of\nTANN in delivering high-fidelity, physically consistent predictions is\ndemonstrated through several examples both at the microscopic and macroscopic\nscale. In particular, we show the efficiency and accuracy of TANN in predicting\nthe average and local stress-strain response, the internal energy and the\ndissipation of both regular and perturbed lattice microstructures in\ninelasticity. Finally, a double-scale homogenization scheme is used to solve a\nlarge scale boundary value problem. The high performance of the homogenized\nmodel using TANN is illustrated through detailed comparisons. An excellent\nagreement is shown for a variety of monotonous and cyclic stress-strain paths.",

    "title": "Predicting Road Flooding Risk with Machine Learning Approaches Using  Crowdsourced Reports and Fine-grained Traffic Data",
    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to predict road flooding risks based on\ntopographic, hydrologic, and temporal precipitation features using machine\nlearning models. Predictive flood monitoring of road network flooding status\nplays an essential role in community hazard mitigation, preparedness, and\nresponse activities. Existing studies related to the estimation of road\ninundations either lack observed road inundation data for model validations or\nfocus mainly on road inundation exposure assessment based on flood maps. This\nstudy addresses this limitation by using crowdsourced and fine-grained traffic\ndata as an indicator of road inundation, and topographic, hydrologic, and\ntemporal precipitation features as predictor variables. Two tree-based machine\nlearning models (random forest and AdaBoost) were then tested and trained for\npredicting road inundations in the contexts of 2017 Hurricane Harvey and 2019\nTropical Storm Imelda in Harris County, Texas. The findings from Hurricane\nHarvey indicate that precipitation is the most important feature for predicting\nroad inundation susceptibility, and that topographic features are more\nessential than hydrologic features for predicting road inundations in both\nstorm cases. The random forest and AdaBoost models had relatively high AUC\nscores (0.860 and 0.810 for Harvey respectively and 0.790 and 0.720 for Imelda\nrespectively) with the random forest model performing better in both cases. The\nrandom forest model showed stable performance for Harvey, while varying\nsignificantly for Imelda. This study advances the emerging field of smart flood\nresilience in terms of predictive flood risk mapping at the road level. For\nexample, such models could help impacted communities and emergency management\nagencies develop better preparedness and response strategies with improved\nsituational awareness of road inundation likelihood as an extreme weather event\nunfolds.",

    "title": "GoPRONTO: a Feedback-based Framework for Nonlinear Optimal Control",
    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a first-order, feedback-based approach to solve\nnonlinear optimal control problems. Taking inspiration from Hauser's PRojection\nOperator Newton method for Trajectory Optimization (PRONTO), we develop\nGo-PRONTO, a generalized first-order framework based on a suitable embedding of\nthe original dynamics into a closed-loop system. By exploiting this\nfeedback-based shooting, we are able to reinterpret the optimal control problem\nas the minimization of a cost function, depending on a state-input curve, whose\ngradient can be computed by resorting to a suitable costate equation. This\nconvenient reformulation gives room for a collection of accelerated numerical\noptimal control schemes based on Conjugate gradient, Heavy-ball, and Nesterov's\naccelerated gradient. An interesting original feature of GoPRONTO is that it\ndoes not require to solve quadratic optimization problems, so that it is well\nsuited for the resolution of optimal control problems involving large-scale\nsystems. To corroborate the theoretical results, numerical simulations on the\noptimal control of an inverted pendulum and a train of 50 inverted\npendulum-on-cart systems are shown.",

    "title": "Neural HMMs are all you need (for high-quality attention-free TTS)",
    "abstract": "Neural sequence-to-sequence TTS has demonstrated significantly better output\nquality over classical statistical parametric speech synthesis using HMMs.\nHowever, the new paradigm is not probabilistic and the use of non-monotonic\nattention both increases training time and introduces \"babbling\" failure modes\nthat are unacceptable in production. In this paper, we demonstrate that the old\nand new paradigms can be combined to obtain the advantages of both worlds, by\nreplacing the attention in Tacotron 2 with an autoregressive left-right no-skip\nhidden-Markov model defined by a neural network. This leads to an HMM-based\nneural TTS model with monotonic alignment, trained to maximise the full\nsequence likelihood without approximations. We discuss how to combine\ninnovations from both classical and contemporary TTS for best results. The\nfinal system is smaller and simpler than Tacotron 2 and learns to align and\nspeak with fewer iterations, while achieving the same speech naturalness.\nUnlike Tacotron 2, it also allows easy control over speaking rate.

    "title": "Robust Interactive Semantic Segmentation of Pathology Images with  Minimal User Input",
    "abstract": "From the simple measurement of tissue attributes in pathology workflow to\ndesigning an explainable diagnostic/prognostic AI tool, access to accurate\nsemantic segmentation of tissue regions in histology images is a prerequisite.\nHowever, delineating different tissue regions manually is a laborious,\ntime-consuming and costly task that requires expert knowledge. On the other\nhand, the state-of-the-art automatic deep learning models for semantic\nsegmentation require lots of annotated training data and there are only a\nlimited number of tissue region annotated images publicly available. To obviate\nthis issue in computational pathology projects and collect large-scale region\nannotations efficiently, we propose an efficient interactive segmentation\nnetwork that requires minimum input from the user to accurately annotate\ndifferent tissue types in the histology image. The user is only required to\ndraw a simple squiggle inside each region of interest so it will be used as the\nguiding signal for the model. To deal with the complex appearance and amorph\ngeometry of different tissue regions we introduce several automatic and\nminimalistic guiding signal generation techniques that help the model to become\nrobust against the variation in the user input. By experimenting on a dataset\nof breast cancer images, we show that not only does our proposed method speed\nup the interactive annotation process, it can also outperform the existing\nautomatic and interactive region segmentation models.",
