    "abstract": "This paper demonstrates that the acceleration/deceleration limits in ACC\nsystems can make a string stable ACC amplify the speed perturbation in natural\ndriving. It is shown that the constrained acceleration/deceleration of the\nfollowing ACCs are likely to cause speed overshoot to compensate for an extra\nlarge/small spacing. Additionally, we find that the constrained deceleration\nlimits can also jeopardize safety, as the limited braking power produces extra\nsmall spacing or even crashes. The findings are validated through experiments\non real cars. The paper suggests that the ACC parameter space should be\nextended to include the acceleration/deceleration limits considering their\nsignificant role exposed here. Through numerical simulations of ACC platoons,\nwe show i) a marginal string stable ACC is preferable due to the smaller total\nqueue length and the shorter duration in congestion; ii) congestion waves in a\nmixed ACC platoon largely depend on the sequence of vehicles provided different\nacceleration/deceleration limits, and iii) the safety hazard caused by the\nconstrained deceleration limits is more significant in mixed ACC platoons when\nstring unstable ACCs exist.",

    "abstract": "Incorporating boundaries of the imaging object as a priori information to\nimaging algorithms can significantly improve the performance of electromagnetic\nmedical imaging systems. To avoid overly complicating the system by using\ndifferent sensors and the adverse effect of the subject's movement, a\nlearning-based method is proposed to estimate the boundary (external contour)\nof the imaged object using the same electromagnetic imaging data. While imaging\ntechniques may discard the reflection coefficients for being dominant and\nuninformative for imaging, these parameters are made use of for boundary\ndetection. The learned model is verified through independent clinical human\ntrials by using a head imaging system with a 16-element antenna array that\nworks across the band 0.7-1.6 GHz. The evaluation demonstrated that the model\nachieves average dissimilarity of 0.012 in Hu-moment while detecting head\nboundary. The model enables fast scan and image creation while eliminating the\nneed for additional devices for accurate boundary estimation.",

    "abstract": "Effectively operating electrical vehicle charging station (EVCS) is crucial\nfor enabling the rapid transition of electrified transportation. To solve this\nproblem using reinforcement learning (RL), the dimension of state/action spaces\nscales with the number of EVs and is thus very large and time-varying. This\ndimensionality issue affects the efficiency and convergence properties of\ngeneric RL algorithms. We develop aggregation schemes that are based on the\nemergency of EV charging, namely the laxity value. A least-laxity first (LLF)\nrule is adopted to consider only the total charging power of the EVCS which\nensures the feasibility of individual EV schedules. In addition, we propose an\nequivalent state aggregation that can guarantee to attain the same optimal\npolicy. Based on the proposed representation, policy gradient method is used to\nfind the best parameters for the linear Gaussian policy .

The task of identifying the main speaker (who is properly taking\nhis/her turn of speaking) and the interrupters (who are interrupting or\nreacting to the main speaker's utterances) remains a challenging task. Although\nsome prior methods have partially addressed this task, there still remain some\nlimitations. Firstly, a direct association of Audio and Visual features may\nlimit the correlations to be extracted due to different modalities. Secondly,\nthe relationship across temporal segments helping to maintain the consistency\nof localization, separation, and conversation contexts is not effectively\nexploited. Finally, the interactions between speakers that usually contain the\ntracking and anticipatory decisions about the transition to a new speaker are\nusually ignored. Therefore, this work introduces a new Audio-Visual Transformer\napproach to the problem of localization and highlighting the main speaker in\nboth audio and visual channels of a multi-speaker conversation video in the\nwild. The proposed method exploits different types of correlations presented in\nboth visual and audio signals. The temporal audio-visual relationships across\nspatial-temporal space are anticipated and optimized via the self-attention\nmechanism in a Transformerstructure.

    "abstract": "Recent research in embodied AI has been boosted by the use of simulation\nenvironments to develop and train robot learning approaches. However, the use\nof simulation has skewed the attention to tasks that only require what robotics\nsimulators can simulate: motion and physical contact. We present iGibson 2.0,\nan open-source simulation environment that supports the simulation of a more\ndiverse set of household tasks through three key innovations. First, iGibson\n2.0 supports object states, including temperature, wetness level, cleanliness\nlevel, and toggled and sliced states, necessary to cover a wider range of\ntasks. Second, iGibson 2.0 implements a set of predicate logic functions that\nmap the simulator states to logic states like Cooked or Soaked. Additionally,\ngiven a logic state, iGibson 2.0 can sample valid physical states that satisfy\nit. This functionality can generate potentially infinite instances of tasks\nwith minimal effort from the users. The sampling mechanism allows our scenes to\nbe more densely populated with small objects in semantically meaningful\nlocations. Third, iGibson 2.0 includes a virtual reality (VR) interface to\nimmerse humans in its scenes to collect demonstrations. As a result, we can\ncollect demonstrations from humans on these new types of tasks, and use them\nfor imitation learning. We evaluate the new capabilities of iGibson 2.0 to\nenable robot learning of novel tasks, in the hope of demonstrating the\npotential of this new simulator to support new research in embodied AI. iGibson\n2.0 and its new dataset will be publicly available at\nthis http URL",

In machine condition monitoring, time-series\nvibration data are overly used in data mining for deep neural networks.\nTypically, vibration data is converted into images for classification using\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs), and scalograms are the most effective form of\nimage representation. However, the DNN classifiers require huge labeled\ntraining samples to reach their optimum performance. So, many forms of data\naugmentation techniques are applied to the classifiers to compensate for the\nlack of training samples. However, the scalograms are graphical representations\nwhere the existing augmentation techniques suffer because they either change\nthe graphical meaning or have too much noise in the samples that change the\nphysical meaning. In this study, a data augmentation technique named ensemble\naugmentation is proposed to overcome this limitation.

After averaging the signal with ensembles, a new\nsignal is obtained that contains the characteristics of the original signal.\nThe parameters for the ensemble augmentation are validated using a simulated\nsignal.

    "abstract": "The development of high quality medical image segmentation algorithms depends\non the availability of large datasets with pixel-level labels. The challenges\nof collecting such datasets, especially in case of 3D volumes, motivate to\ndevelop approaches that can learn from other types of labels that are cheap to\nobtain, e.g. bounding boxes. We focus on 3D medical images with their\ncorresponding 3D bounding boxes which are considered as series of per-slice\nnon-tight 2D bounding boxes. While current weakly-supervised approaches that\nuse 2D bounding boxes as weak labels can be applied to medical image\nsegmentation, we show that their success is limited in cases when the\nassumption about the tightness of the bounding boxes breaks. We propose a new\nbounding box correction framework which is trained on a small set of\npixel-level annotations to improve the tightness of a larger set of non-tight\nbounding box annotations. The effectiveness of our solution is demonstrated by\nevaluating a known weakly-supervised segmentation approach with and without the\nproposed bounding box correction algorithm. When the tightness is improved by\nour solution, the results of the weakly-supervised segmentation become much\ncloser to those of the fully-supervised one.",

    "abstract": "The control of a robot for manipulation tasks generally relies on object\ndetection and pose estimation. An attractive alternative is to learn control\npolicies directly from raw input data. However, this approach is time-consuming\nand expensive since learning the policy requires many trials with robot actions\nin the physical environment. To reduce the training cost, the policy can be\nlearned in simulation with a large set of synthetic images. The limit of this\napproach is the domain gap between the simulation and the robot workspace. In\nthis paper, we propose to learn a policy for robot reaching movements from a\nsingle image captured directly in the robot workspace from a camera placed on\nthe end-effector (a hand-eye camera). The idea behind the proposed policy\nlearner is that view changes seen from the hand-eye camera produced by actions\nin the robot workspace are analogous to locating a region-of-interest in a\nsingle image by performing sequential object localisation. This similar view\nchange enables training of object reaching policies using\nreinforcement-learning-based sequential object localisation. To facilitate the\nadaptation of the policy to view changes in the robot workspace, we further\npresent a dynamic filter that learns to bias an input state to remove\nirrelevant information for an action decision. The proposed policy learner can\nbe used as a powerful representation for robotic tasks, and we validate it on\nstatic and moving object reaching tasks.",

For the RGB, and derived\noptical-flow, modality many large-scale labeled datasets have been made\navailable. They have become the de facto pre-training choice when recognizing\nor detecting new actions from RGB datasets that have limited amounts of labeled\nexamples available. Unfortunately, large-scale labeled action datasets for\nother modalities are unavailable for pre-training. In this paper, our goal is\nto recognize actions from limited examples in non-RGB video modalities, by\nlearning from large-scale labeled RGB data. To this end, we propose a two-step\ntraining process: (i) we extract action representation knowledge from an\nRGB-trained teacher network and adapt it to a non-RGB student network. (ii) we\nthen fine-tune the transfer model with available labeled examples of the target\nmodality. For the knowledge transfer we introduce feature-supervision\nstrategies, which rely on unlabeled pairs of two modalities (the RGB and the\ntarget modality) to transfer feature level representations from the teacher to\nthe student network. Ablations and generalizations with two RGB source datasets\nand two non-RGB target datasets demonstrate that an optical-flow teacher\nprovides better action transfer features than RGB for both depth maps and\n3D-skeletons, even when evaluated on a different target domain, or for a\ndifferent task.

This simple addition allows us to use\nglobal self-attention, the key element of transformers, directly for graphs and\ncomes with the benefit of long-range interaction among nodes. Moreover, the\nedge channels allow the structural information to evolve from layer to layer,\nand prediction tasks on edges can be derived directly from these channels. In\naddition to that, we introduce positional encodings based on Singular Value\nDecomposition which can improve the performance of EGT. Our framework, which\nrelies on global node feature aggregation, achieves better performance compared\nto Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), which rely on local feature aggregation\nwithin a neighborhood. We verify the performance of EGT in a supervised\nlearning setting on a wide range of experiments on benchmark datasets.

A modified line-search Newton's method is adopted to strictly prevent\nmaterial points from penetrating the FEM domain, ensuring convergence and\nfeasibility regardless of the time step size or the mesh resolutions. The\nproposed coupling scheme also reduces to a new approach for imposing separable\nfrictional kinematic boundaries for MPM when all nodal displacements in the FEM\ndomain are prescribed with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Compared to standard\nimplicit time integration, the extra algorithmic components associated with the\ncontact treatment only depend on simple point-segment (or point-triangle in 3D)\ngeometric queries which robustly handle arbitrary FEM mesh boundaries\nrepresented with codimension-1 simplices.

    "abstract": "Motives or goals are recognized in psychology literature as the most\nfundamental drive that explains and predicts why people do what they do,\nincluding when they browse the web. Although providing enormous value, these\nhigher-ordered goals are often unobserved, and little is known about how to\nleverage such goals to assist people's browsing activities. This paper proposes\nto take a new approach to address this problem, which is fulfilled through a\nnovel neural framework, Goal-directed Web Browsing (GoWeB). We adopt a\npsychologically-sound taxonomy of higher-ordered goals and learn to build their\nrepresentations in a structure-preserving manner. Then we incorporate the\nresulting representations for enhancing the experiences of common activities\npeople perform on the web. Experiments on large-scale data from Microsoft Edge\nweb browser show that GoWeB significantly outperforms competitive baselines for\nin-session web page recommendation, re-visitation classification, and\ngoal-based web page grouping. A follow-up analysis further characterizes how\nthe variety of human motives can affect the difference observed in human\nbehavioral patterns.",

In practice, the timely application of security\npatches in downstream software is challenging. The main reason is that such\npatches do not explicitly indicate their security impacts in the documentation,\nwhich would be difficult to recognize for software maintainers and users.\nHowever, attackers can still identify these \"secret\" security patches by\nanalyzing the source code and generate corresponding exploits to compromise not\nonly unpatched versions of the current software, but also other similar\nsoftware packages that may contain the same vulnerability due to code cloning\nor similar design/implementation logic. Therefore, it is critical to identify\nthese secret security patches to enable timely fixes. To this end, we propose a\ndeep learning-based defense system called PatchRNN to automatically identify\nsecret security patches in OSS. Besides considering descriptive keywords in the\ncommit message (i.e., at the text level), we leverage both syntactic and\nsemantic features at the source-code level. To evaluate the performance of our\nsystem, we apply it on a large-scale real-world patch dataset and conduct a\ncase study on a popular open-source web server software - NGINX.

These approaches serve a\ncritical purpose for academic literature reviews, yet there remain challenges\nin identifying relevant literature when similar work may utilize different\nterminology (e.g., mixed-initiative visual analytics papers may not use the\nsame terminology as papers on model-steering, yet the two topics are relevant\nto one another). In this paper, we introduce a system, VITALITY, intended to\ncomplement existing practices. In particular, VITALITY promotes serendipitous\ndiscovery of relevant literature using transformer language models, allowing\nusers to find semantically similar papers in a word embedding space given (1) a\nlist of input paper(s) or (2) a working abstract. VITALITY visualizes this\ndocument-level embedding space in an interactive 2-D scatterplot using\ndimension reduction. VITALITY also summarizes meta information about the\ndocument corpus or search query, including keywords and co-authors, and allows\nusers to save and export papers for use in a literature review. We present\nqualitative findings from an evaluation of VITALITY, suggesting it can be a\npromising complementary technique for conducting academic literature reviews.\nFurthermore, we contribute data from 38 popular data visualization publication\nvenues in VITALITY, and we provide scrapers for the open-source community to\ncontinue to grow the list of supported venues.",

Despite the fact that the\noperational meaning of ordered disjunction is clear, there exists an important\nopen issue regarding its semantics.

In particular, we propose two\napproaches - a Recurrent Neural Network based approach using Pointer Network\nand a Convolutional Neural Network based approach using Mask-RCNN to identify\nrooms (and thereby floor plans) from point-clouds. Experimental results on\ndifferent datasets demonstrate approximately 0.80-0.90 Intersection-over-Union\nscores, which show that our models can effectively identify the rooms and\nregenerate the shapes of the rooms in heterogeneous environment.",

    "abstract": "Due to the lack of a large-scale reflection removal dataset with diverse\nreal-world scenes, many existing reflection removal methods are trained on\nsynthetic data plus a small amount of real-world data, which makes it difficult\nto evaluate the strengths or weaknesses of different reflection removal methods\nthoroughly. Furthermore, existing real-world benchmarks and datasets do not\ncategorize image data based on the types and appearances of reflection (e.g.,\nsmoothness, intensity), making it hard to analyze reflection removal methods.\nHence, we construct a new reflection removal dataset that is categorized,\ndiverse, and real-world (CDR). A pipeline based on RAW data is used to capture\nperfectly aligned input images and transmission images. The dataset is\nconstructed using diverse glass types under various environments to ensure\ndiversity. By analyzing several reflection removal methods and conducting\nextensive experiments on our dataset, we show that state-of-the-art reflection\nremoval methods generally perform well on blurry reflection but fail in\nobtaining satisfying performance on other types of real-world reflection. We\nbelieve our dataset can help develop novel methods to remove real-world\nreflection better. Our dataset is available at\nhttps://alexzhao-hugga.github.io/Real-World-Reflection-Removal/.",

In this paper, we first perform empirical studies to\nvalidate that GNNExplainer can act as an inspection tool and have the potential\nto detect the adversarial perturbations for graphs. This finding motivates us\nto further initiate a new problem investigation: Whether a graph neural network\nand its explanations can be jointly attacked by modifying graphs with malicious\ndesires? It is challenging to answer this question since the goals of\nadversarial attacks and bypassing the GNNExplainer essentially contradict each\nother. In this work, we give a confirmative answer to this question by\nproposing a novel attack framework (GEAttack), which can attack both a GNN\nmodel and its explanations by simultaneously exploiting their vulnerabilities.\nExtensive experiments on two explainers (GNNExplainer and PGExplainer) under\nvarious real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod.",

However, the results of the classification of\nfractures in subtypes with the proposed datasets were far from optimal. This\npaper proposes a very recent and outperforming deep learning technique, the\nVision Transformer (ViT), in order to improve the fracture classification, by\nexploiting its self-attention mechanism.\nMethods: 4207 manually annotated images were used and distributed, by\nfollowing the AO/OTA classification, in different fracture types, the largest\nlabeled dataset of proximal femur fractures used in literature. The ViT\narchitecture was used and compared with a classic Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) and a multistage architecture composed by successive CNNs in cascade. To\ndemonstrate the reliability of this approach, 1) the attention maps were used\nto visualize the most relevant areas of the images, 2) the performance of a\ngeneric CNN and ViT was also compared through unsupervised learning techniques,\nand 3) 11 specialists were asked to evaluate and classify 150 proximal femur\nfractures' images with and without the help of the ViT.\nResults: The ViT was able to correctly predict 83% of the test images.\nPrecision, recall and F1-score were 0.77 (CI 0.64-0.90), 0.76 (CI 0.62-0.91)\nand 0.77 (CI 0.64-0.89), respectively.

    "abstract": "The selective visual attention mechanism in the human visual system (HVS)\nrestricts the amount of information to reach visual awareness for perceiving\nnatural scenes, allowing near real-time information processing with limited\ncomputational capacity [Koch and Ullman, 1987]. This kind of selectivity acts\nas an 'Information Bottleneck (IB)', which seeks a trade-off between\ninformation compression and predictive accuracy. However, such information\nconstraints are rarely explored in the attention mechanism for deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs). In this paper, we propose an IB-inspired spatial attention\nmodule for DNN structures built for visual recognition. The module takes as\ninput an intermediate representation of the input image, and outputs a\nvariational 2D attention map that minimizes the mutual information (MI) between\nthe attention-modulated representation and the input, while maximizing the MI\nbetween the attention-modulated representation and the task label. To further\nrestrict the information bypassed by the attention map, we quantize the\ncontinuous attention scores to a set of learnable anchor values during\ntraining. Extensive experiments show that the proposed IB-inspired spatial\nattention mechanism can yield attention maps that neatly highlight the regions\nof interest while suppressing backgrounds, and bootstrap standard DNN\nstructures for visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification,\nfine-grained recognition, cross-domain classification). The attention maps are\ninterpretable for the decision making of the DNNs as verified in the\nexperiments. Our code is available at https://github.com/ashleylqx/AIB.git.",

    "abstract": "Faces manifest large variations in many aspects, such as identity,\nexpression, pose, and face styling. Therefore, it is a great challenge to\ndisentangle and extract these characteristics from facial images, especially in\nan unsupervised manner. In this work, we introduce cycle-consistency in facial\ncharacteristics as free supervisory signal to learn facial representations from\nunlabeled facial images. The learning is realized by superimposing the facial\nmotion cycle-consistency and identity cycle-consistency constraints. The main\nidea of the facial motion cycle-consistency is that, given a face with\nexpression, we can perform de-expression to a neutral face via the removal of\nfacial motion and further perform re-expression to reconstruct back to the\noriginal face. The main idea of the identity cycle-consistency is to exploit\nboth de-identity into mean face by depriving the given neutral face of its\nidentity via feature re-normalization and re-identity into neutral face by\nadding the personal attributes to the mean face. At training time, our model\nlearns to disentangle two distinct facial representations to be useful for\nperforming cycle-consistent face reconstruction. At test time, we use the\nlinear protocol scheme for evaluating facial representations on various tasks,\nincluding facial expression recognition and head pose regression. We also can\ndirectly apply the learnt facial representations to person recognition,\nfrontalization and image-to-image translation. Our experiments show that the\nresults of our approach is competitive with those of existing methods,\ndemonstrating the rich and unique information embedded in the disentangled\nrepresentations.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we observe two levels of redundancies when applying vision\ntransformers (ViT) for image recognition. First, fixing the number of tokens\nthrough the whole network produces redundant features at the spatial level.\nSecond, the attention maps among different transformer layers are redundant.\nBased on the observations above, we propose a PSViT: a ViT with token Pooling\nand attention Sharing to reduce the redundancy, effectively enhancing the\nfeature representation ability, and achieving a better speed-accuracy\ntrade-off. Specifically, in our PSViT, token pooling can be defined as the\noperation that decreases the number of tokens at the spatial level. Besides,\nattention sharing will be built between the neighboring transformer layers for\nreusing the attention maps having a strong correlation among adjacent layers.\nThen, a compact set of the possible combinations for different token pooling\nand attention sharing mechanisms are constructed. Based on the proposed compact\nset, the number of tokens in each layer and the choices of layers sharing\nattention can be treated as hyper-parameters that are learned from data\nautomatically.

    "abstract": "The success of neural networks on medical image segmentation tasks typically\nrelies on large labeled datasets for model training. However, acquiring and\nmanually labeling a large medical image set is resource-intensive, expensive,\nand sometimes impractical due to data sharing and privacy issues. To address\nthis challenge, we propose an adversarial data augmentation approach to improve\nthe efficiency in utilizing training data and to enlarge the dataset via\nsimulated but realistic transformations. Specifically, we present a generic\ntask-driven learning framework, which jointly optimizes a data augmentation\nmodel and a segmentation network during training, generating informative\nexamples to enhance network generalizability for the downstream task. The data\naugmentation model utilizes a set of photometric and geometric image\ntransformations and chains them to simulate realistic complex imaging\nvariations that could exist in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The proposed\nadversarial data augmentation does not rely on generative networks and can be\nused as a plug-in module in general segmentation networks. It is\ncomputationally efficient and applicable for both supervised and\nsemi-supervised learning. We analyze and evaluate the method on two MR image\nsegmentation tasks: cardiac segmentation and prostate segmentation.

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning from pre-trained ImageNet models has been a simple, effective,\nand popular approach for various computer vision tasks. The common practice of\nfine-tuning is to adopt a default hyperparameter setting with a fixed\npre-trained model, while both of them are not optimized for specific tasks and\ntime constraints. Moreover, in cloud computing or GPU clusters where the tasks\narrive sequentially in a stream, faster online fine-tuning is a more desired\nand realistic strategy for saving money, energy consumption, and CO2 emission.\nIn this paper, we propose a joint Neural Architecture Search and Online\nAdaption framework named NASOA towards a faster task-oriented fine-tuning upon\nthe request of users. Specifically, NASOA first adopts an offline NAS to\nidentify a group of training-efficient networks to form a pretrained model zoo.\nWe propose a novel joint block and macro-level search space to enable a\nflexible and efficient search. Then, by estimating fine-tuning performance via\nan adaptive model by accumulating experience from the past tasks, an online\nschedule generator is proposed to pick up the most suitable model and generate\na personalized training regime with respect to each desired task in a one-shot\nfashion. The resulting model zoo is more training efficient than SOTA models,\ne.g. 6x faster than RegNetY-16GF, and 1.7x faster than EfficientNetB3.\nExperiments on multiple datasets also show that NASOA achieves much better\nfine-tuning results, i.e. improving around 2.1% accuracy than the best\nperformance in RegNet series under various constraints and tasks; 40x faster\ncompared to the BOHB.",

Among the topics of interest, a key problem\nrelates to identifying so-called influential users for a number of\napplications, such as spreading messages, viral marketing or preventing rumour\npropagation. Several approaches have been proposed to estimate users' influence\nand identify sets of influential users in social networks. A common basis of\nthese approaches is to consider links between users, that is, structural or\ntopological properties of the network. To a lesser extent, some approaches take\ninto account users' behaviours or attitudes. Although a number of surveys have\nreviewed approaches based on structural properties of social networks, there\nhas been no comprehensive review of approaches that take into account users'\nbehaviour.

    "abstract": "In this work, we address the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for\nperson re-ID where annotations are available for the source domain but not for\ntarget. Previous methods typically follow a two-stage optimization pipeline,\nwhere the network is first pre-trained on source and then fine-tuned on target\nwith pseudo labels created by feature clustering. Such methods sustain two main\nlimitations. (1) The label noise may hinder the learning of discriminative\nfeatures for recognizing target classes. (2) The domain gap may hinder\nknowledge transferring from source to target. We propose three types of\ntechnical schemes to alleviate these issues. First, we propose a cluster-wise\ncontrastive learning algorithm (CCL) by iterative optimization of feature\nlearning and cluster refinery to learn noise-tolerant representations in the\nunsupervised manner. Second, we adopt a progressive domain adaptation (PDA)\nstrategy to gradually mitigate the domain gap between source and target data.\nThird, we propose Fourier augmentation (FA) for further maximizing the class\nseparability of re-ID models by imposing extra constraints in the Fourier\nspace. We observe that these proposed schemes are capable of facilitating the\nlearning of discriminative feature representations. Experiments demonstrate\nthat our method consistently achieves notable improvements over the\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods on multiple benchmarks, e.g.,\nsurpassing MMT largely by 8.1\\%, 9.9\\%, 11.4\\% and 11.1\\% mAP on the\nMarket-to-Duke, Duke-to-Market, Market-to-MSMT and Duke-to-MSMT tasks,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "Exposure bias is a well-known issue in recommender systems where items and\nsuppliers are not equally represented in the recommendation results. This is\nespecially problematic when bias is amplified over time as a few popular items\nare repeatedly over-represented in recommendation lists. This phenomenon can be\nviewed as a recommendation feedback loop: the system repeatedly recommends\ncertain items at different time points and interactions of users with those\nitems will amplify bias towards those items over time. This issue has been\nextensively studied in the literature on model-based or neighborhood-based\nrecommendation algorithms, but less work has been done on online recommendation\nmodels such as those based on multi-armed Bandit algorithms. In this paper, we\nstudy exposure bias in a class of well-known bandit algorithms known as Linear\nCascade Bandits. We analyze these algorithms on their ability to handle\nexposure bias and provide a fair representation for items and suppliers in the\nrecommendation results. Our analysis reveals that these algorithms fail to\ntreat items and suppliers fairly and do not sufficiently explore the item space\nfor each user. To mitigate this bias, we propose a discounting factor and\nincorporate it into these algorithms that controls the exposure of items at\neach time step. To show the effectiveness of the proposed discounting factor on\nmitigating exposure bias, we perform experiments on two datasets using three\ncascading bandit algorithms and our experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod improves the exposure fairness for items and suppliers.",

In\naddition, an initial investigation on the dimension of addiction is presented\nthrough the built machine learning model.

To answer this question, we collect 71431\nseminal articles of topics that cover 16 disciplines and their citation data,\nand extracts the \"idea tree\" of each topic to restore the structure of the\ndevelopment of 71431 topic networks from scratch. We define the Knowledge\nEntropy (KE) metric, and the contribution of high knowledge entropy nodes to\nincrease the depth of the idea tree is regarded as the basis for topic\ndevelopment. By observing \"X-ray images\" of topics, We find two interesting\nphenomena: (1) Even though the scale of topics may increase unlimitedly, there\nis an insurmountable cap of topic development: the depth of the idea tree does\nnot exceed 6 jumps, which coincides with the classical \"Six Degrees of\nSeparation\"! (2) It is difficult for a single article to contribute more than 3\njumps to the depth of its topic, to this end, the continuing increase in the\ndepth of the idea tree needs to be motivated by the influence relay of multiple\nhigh knowledge entropy nodes. Through substantial statistical fits, we derive a\nunified quantitative relationship between the change in topic depth ${\\Delta\nD}^t(v)$ and the change in knowledge entropy over time ${KE}^t\\left(v\\right)$\nof the article $v$ driving the increase in depth in the topic: ${\\Delta D}^t(v)\n\\approx \\log \\frac{KE^{t}(v)}{\\left(t-t_{0}\\right)^{1.8803}}$ , which can\neffectively portray evolution patterns of topics and predict their development\npotential.

It is shown that the continuous-time output\nfeedback boundary control applied in a sample-and-hold fashion ensures global\nclosed-loop exponential stability, provided that the sampling period is\nsufficiently small. Further, robustness to perturbations of the sampling\nschedule is guaranteed. For the event-triggered implementation of the\ncontinuous-time controller, a dynamic triggering condition is utilized. The\ntriggering condition determines the time instants at which the control input\nneeds to be updated. Under the observer-based event-triggered boundary control,\nit is shown that there is a minimal dwell-time between two triggering instants\nindependent of initial conditions. Further, the global exponential convergence\nof the closed-loop system to the equilibrium point is established. A simulation\nexample is provided to validate the theoretical results.",

    "abstract": "Portrait images often suffer from undesirable shadows cast by casual objects\nor even the face itself. While existing methods for portrait shadow removal\nrequire training on a large-scale synthetic dataset, we propose the first\nunsupervised method for portrait shadow removal without any training data. Our\nkey idea is to leverage the generative facial priors embedded in the\noff-the-shelf pretrained StyleGAN2. To achieve this, we formulate the shadow\nremoval task as a layer decomposition problem: a shadowed portrait image is\nconstructed by the blending of a shadow image and a shadow-free image. We\npropose an effective progressive optimization algorithm to learn the\ndecomposition process. Our approach can also be extended to portrait tattoo\nremoval and watermark removal. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on a\nreal-world portrait shadow dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves\ncomparable performance with supervised shadow removal methods.

    "abstract": "Given a combinatorial search problem, it may be highly useful to enumerate\nits (all) solutions besides just finding one solution, or showing that none\nexists. The same can be stated about optimal solutions if an objective function\nis provided. This work goes beyond the bare enumeration of optimal solutions\nand addresses the computational task of solution enumeration by optimality\n(SEO). This task is studied in the context of Answer Set Programming (ASP)\nwhere (optimal) solutions of a problem are captured with the answer sets of a\nlogic program encoding the problem. Existing answer-set solvers already support\nthe enumeration of all (optimal) answer sets. However, in this work, we\ngeneralize the enumeration of optimal answer sets beyond strictly optimal ones,\ngiving rise to the idea of answer set enumeration in the order of optimality\n(ASEO). This approach is applicable up to the best k answer sets or in an\nunlimited setting, which amounts to a process of sorting answer sets based on\nthe objective function. As the main contribution of this work, we present the\nfirst general algorithms for the aforementioned tasks of answer set\nenumeration. Moreover, we illustrate the potential use cases of ASEO. First, we\nstudy how efficiently access to the next-best solutions can be achieved in a\nnumber of optimization problems that have been formalized and solved in ASP.\nSecond, we show that ASEO provides us with an effective sampling technique for\nBayesian networks.",

    "abstract": "The vulnerability of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis has not been studied from\nthe purview of Membership Inference Attacks. Through this work, we are the\nfirst to empirically show that the lottery ticket networks are equally\nvulnerable to membership inference attacks. A Membership Inference Attack (MIA)\nis the process of determining whether a data sample belongs to a training set\nof a trained model or not. Membership Inference Attacks could leak critical\ninformation about the training data that can be used for targeted attacks.\nRecent deep learning models often have very large memory footprints and a high\ncomputational cost associated with training and drawing inferences. Lottery\nTicket Hypothesis is used to prune the networks to find smaller sub-networks\nthat at least match the performance of the original model in terms of test\naccuracy in a similar number of iterations. We used CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImageNet datasets to perform image classification tasks and observe that the\nattack accuracies are similar. We also see that the attack accuracy varies\ndirectly according to the number of classes in the dataset and the sparsity of\nthe network. We demonstrate that these attacks are transferable across models\nwith high accuracy.",

To empower conventional CNNs in learning geometric clues of\nlanes, we propose a deep network named ContinuityLearner to better learn\ngeometric prior within lane. Specifically, our proposed CNN-based paradigm\ninvolves a novel Context-encoding image feature learning network to generate\nclass-dependent image feature maps and a new encoding layer to exploit the\ngeometric continuity feature representation by fusing both spatial and visual\ninformation of lane together. The ContinuityLearner, performing on the\ngeometric continuity feature of lanes, is trained to directly predict the lane\nin traffic scenarios with integrated and continuous instance semantic. The\nexperimental results on the CULane dataset and the Tusimple benchmark\ndemonstrate that our ContinuityLearner has superior performance over other\nstate-of-the-art techniques in lane segmentation.",

However, in many settings, some arriving\nagents may be patient and willing to wait a short amount of time for the\nresource. Motivated by this, we study the online resource allocation problem in\nthe presence of time-flexible agents under an adversarial online arrival model.\nWe present a setting with flexible and inflexible agents who seek a resource or\nservice that replenishes periodically. Inflexible agents demand the resource\nimmediately upon arrival while flexible agents are willing to wait a short\nperiod of time. Our work presents a class of POLYtope-based Resource Allocation\n(POLYRA) algorithms that achieve optimal or near-optimal competitive ratios\nunder an adversarial arrival process. Such POLYRA algorithms work by consulting\na particular polytope and only making decisions that guarantee the algorithm's\nstate remains feasible in this polytope. When the number of agent types is\neither two or three, POLYRA algorithms can obtain the optimal competitive\nratio. We design these polytopes by constructing an upper bound on the\ncompetitive ratio of any algorithm, which is characterized via a linear program\n(LP) that considers a collection of overlapping worst-case input sequences. Our\ndesigned POLYRA algorithms then mimic the optimal solution of this upper bound\nLP via its polytope's definition, obtaining the optimal competitive ratio. When\nthere are more than three types, we show that our overlapping worst-case input\nsequences do not result in an attainable competitive ratio, adding an\nadditional challenge to the problem. Considering this, we present a\nnear-optimal nested POLYRA algorithm which achieves at least 80% of the optimal\ncompetitive ratio while having a simple and interpretable structure.",

Importantly, online forums such as Reddit do not have a user-generated\nsocial graph, which is assumed in social network behavioral-based\nclassification settings. Using Reddit as a case-study, we show how to obtain a\nderived social graph, and use this graph, Reddit post sequences, and comment\ntrees as inputs to a Recurrent Graph Neural Network (R-GNN) encoder.

    "title": "Disentangled High Quality Salient Object Detection",
    "abstract": "Aiming at discovering and locating most distinctive objects from visual\nscenes, salient object detection (SOD) plays an essential role in various\ncomputer vision systems. Coming to the era of high resolution, SOD methods are\nfacing new challenges. The major limitation of previous methods is that they\ntry to identify the salient regions and estimate the accurate objects\nboundaries simultaneously with a single regression task at low-resolution. This\npractice ignores the inherent difference between the two difficult problems,\nresulting in poor detection quality. In this paper, we propose a novel deep\nlearning framework for high-resolution SOD task, which disentangles the task\ninto a low-resolution saliency classification network (LRSCN) and a\nhigh-resolution refinement network (HRRN). As a pixel-wise classification task,\nLRSCN is designed to capture sufficient semantics at low-resolution to identify\nthe definite salient, background and uncertain image regions. HRRN is a\nregression task, which aims at accurately refining the saliency value of pixels\nin the uncertain region to preserve a clear object boundary at high-resolution\nwith limited GPU memory. It is worth noting that by introducing uncertainty\ninto the training process, our HRRN can well address the high-resolution\nrefinement task without using any high-resolution training data. Extensive\nexperiments on high-resolution saliency datasets as well as some widely used\nsaliency benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves superior performance\ncompared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Domain adaptation aims to bridge the domain shifts between the source and\ntarget domains. These shifts may span different dimensions such as fog,\nrainfall, etc. However, recent methods typically do not consider explicit prior\nknowledge on a specific dimension, thus leading to less desired adaptation\nperformance. In this paper, we study a practical setting called Specific Domain\nAdaptation (SDA) that aligns the source and target domains in a\ndemanded-specific dimension. Within this setting, we observe the intra-domain\ngap induced by different domainness (i.e., numerical magnitudes of this\ndimension) is crucial when adapting to a specific domain. To address the\nproblem, we propose a novel Self-Adversarial Disentangling (SAD) framework. In\nparticular, given a specific dimension, we first enrich the source domain by\nintroducing a domainness creator with providing additional supervisory signals.\nGuided by the created domainness, we design a self-adversarial regularizer and\ntwo loss functions to jointly disentangle the latent representations into\ndomainness-specific and domainness-invariant features, thus mitigating the\nintra-domain gap. Our method can be easily taken as a plug-and-play framework\nand does not introduce any extra costs in the inference time. We achieve\nconsistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both object detection\nand semantic segmentation tasks.",

Intraoperative diagnosis\ncan be challenging due to tumor diversity and lack of intraoperative pathology\nresources.\nObjective: To develop an independent and parallel intraoperative pathology\nworkflow that can provide rapid and accurate skull base tumor diagnoses using\nlabel-free optical imaging and artificial intelligence (AI).\nMethod: We used a fiber laser-based, label-free, non-consumptive,\nhigh-resolution microscopy method ($<$ 60 sec per 1 $\\times$ 1 mm$^\\text{2}$),\ncalled stimulated Raman histology (SRH), to image a consecutive, multicenter\ncohort of skull base tumor patients. SRH images were then used to train a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) model using three representation learning\nstrategies: cross-entropy, self-supervised contrastive learning, and supervised\ncontrastive learning. Our trained CNN models were tested on a held-out,\nmulticenter SRH dataset.\nResults: SRH was able to image the diagnostic features of both benign and\nmalignant skull base tumors. Of the three representation learning strategies,\nsupervised contrastive learning most effectively learned the distinctive and\ndiagnostic SRH image features for each of the skull base tumor types. In our\nmulticenter testing set, cross-entropy achieved an overall diagnostic accuracy\nof 91.5%, self-supervised contrastive learning 83.9%, and supervised\ncontrastive learning 96.6%. Our trained model was able to identify tumor-normal\nmargins and detect regions of microscopic tumor infiltration in whole-slide SRH\nimages.\nConclusion: SRH with AI models trained using contrastive representation\nlearning can provide rapid and accurate intraoperative diagnosis of skull base\ntumors.",

Although the domain shifts may\nexist in various dimensions such as appearance, textures, etc, the contextual\ndependency, which is generally shared across different domains, is neglected by\nrecent methods.

Firstly, we design a contextual mask generation\nstrategy by leveraging accumulated spatial distributions and contextual\nrelationships.

To alleviate the over-alignment (e.g.,\nearly performance degradation), the source and target significance masks are\nmixed based on the contextual mask into the mixed significance mask, and we\nintroduce a significance-reweighted consistency loss on it.

Compared to cloud computing, edge/fog servers have fewer\nresources, but they can be accessed with higher bandwidth and less\ncommunication latency. Thus, integrating edge/fog and cloud infrastructures can\nsupport the execution of diverse latency-sensitive and computation-intensive\nIoT applications. Although some frameworks attempt to provide such integration,\nthere are still several challenges to be addressed, such as dynamic scheduling\nof different IoT applications, scalability mechanisms, multi-platform support,\nand supporting different interaction models. To overcome these challenges, we\npropose a lightweight and distributed container-based framework, called\nFogBus2. It provides a mechanism for scheduling heterogeneous IoT applications\nand implements several scheduling policies. Also, it proposes an optimized\ngenetic algorithm to obtain fast convergence to well-suited solutions. Besides,\nit offers a scalability mechanism to ensure efficient responsiveness when\neither the number of IoT devices increases or the resources become\noverburdened. Also, the dynamic resource discovery mechanism of FogBus2 assists\nnew entities to quickly join the system. We have also developed two IoT\napplications, called Conway's Game of Life and Video Optical Character\nRecognition to demonstrate the effectiveness of FogBus2 for handling real-time\nand non-real-time IoT applications. Experimental results show FogBus2's\nscheduling policy improves the response time of IoT applications by 53\\%\ncompared to other policies.

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series anomaly detection is a very common problem in the\nfield of failure prevention. Fast prevention means lower repair costs and\nlosses. The amount of sensors in novel industry systems makes the anomaly\ndetection process quite difficult for humans. Algorithms which automates the\nprocess of detecting anomalies are crucial in modern failure-prevention\nsystems. Therefore, many machine and deep learning models have been designed to\naddress this problem. Mostly, they are autoencoder-based architectures with\nsome generative adversarial elements. In this work, a framework is shown which\nincorporates neuroevolution methods to boost the anomaly-detection scores of\nnew and already known models. The presented approach adapts evolution\nstrategies for evolving ensemble model, in which every single model works on a\nsubgroup of data sensors. The next goal of neuroevolution is to optimise\narchitecture and hyperparameters like window size, the number of layers, layer\ndepths, etc. The proposed framework shows that it is possible to boost most of\nthe anomaly detection deep learning models in a reasonable time and a fully\nautomated mode.

    "title": "PoolRank: Max/Min Pooling-based Ranking Loss for Listwise Learning &  Ranking Balance",
    "abstract": "Numerous neural retrieval models have been proposed in recent years. These\nmodels learn to compute a ranking score between the given query and document.\nThe majority of existing models are trained in pairwise fashion using\nhuman-judged labels directly without further calibration. The traditional\npairwise schemes can be time-consuming and require pre-defined\npositive-negative document pairs for training, potentially leading to learning\nbias due to document distribution mismatch between training and test\nconditions. Some popular existing listwise schemes rely on the strong\npre-defined probabilistic assumptions and stark difference between relevant and\nnon-relevant documents for the given query, which may limit the model potential\ndue to the low-quality or ambiguous relevance labels. To address these\nconcerns, we turn to a physics-inspired ranking balance scheme and propose\nPoolRank, a pooling-based listwise learning framework. The proposed scheme has\nfour major advantages: (1) PoolRank extracts training information from the best\ncandidates at the local level based on model performance and relative ranking\namong abundant document candidates. (2) By combining four pooling-based loss\ncomponents in a multi-task learning fashion, PoolRank calibrates the ranking\nbalance for the partially relevant and the highly non-relevant documents\nautomatically without costly human inspection. (3) PoolRank can be easily\ngeneralized to any neural retrieval model without requiring additional\nlearnable parameters or model structure modifications. (4) Compared to pairwise\nlearning and existing listwise learning schemes, PoolRank yields better ranking\nperformance for all studied retrieval models while retaining efficient\nconvergence rates.",

    "abstract": "Forecast evaluation plays a key role in how empirical evidence shapes the\ndevelopment of the discipline. Domain experts are interested in error measures\nrelevant for their decision making needs. Such measures may produce unreliable\nresults. Although reliability properties of several metrics have already been\ndiscussed, it has hardly been quantified in an objective way. We propose a\nmeasure named Rank Stability, which evaluates how much the rankings of an\nexperiment differ in between similar datasets, when the models and errors are\nconstant. We use this to study the evaluation setup of the M5. We find that the\nevaluation setup of the M5 is less reliable than other measures. The main\ndrivers of instability are hierarchical aggregation and scaling.\nPrice-weighting reduces the stability of all tested error measures. Scale\nnormalization of the M5 error measure results in less stability than other\nscale-free errors. Hierarchical levels taken separately are less stable with\nmore aggregation, and their combination is even less stable than individual\nlevels. We also show positive tradeoffs of retaining aggregation importance\nwithout affecting stability. Aggregation and stability can be linked to the\ninfluence of much debated magic numbers. Many of our findings can be applied to\ngeneral hierarchical forecast benchmarking.",

Allowing end users,\nsuch as shop floor workers, to program collaborative robots themselves would\nmake it easy to \"retask\" robots from one process to another, facilitating their\nadoption by small and medium enterprises. Our approach builds on the paradigm\nof trigger-action programming (TAP) by allowing end users to create rich\ninteractions through simple trigger-action pairings. It enables end users to\niteratively create, edit, and refine a reactive robot program while executing\npartial programs. This live programming approach enables the user to utilize\nthe task space and objects by incrementally specifying situated trigger-action\npairs, substantially lowering the barrier to entry for programming or\nreprogramming robots for collaboration. We instantiate situated live\nprogramming in an authoring system where users can create trigger-action\nprograms by annotating an augmented video feed from the robot's perspective and\nassign robot actions to trigger conditions. We evaluated this system in a study\nwhere participants (n = 10) developed robot programs for solving collaborative\nlight-manufacturing tasks.

    "abstract": "Chinese character style transfer is a very challenging problem because of the\ncomplexity of the glyph shapes or underlying structures and large numbers of\nexisted characters, when comparing with English letters. Moreover, the\nhandwriting of calligraphy masters has a more irregular stroke and is difficult\nto obtain in real-world scenarios. Recently, several GAN-based methods have\nbeen proposed for font synthesis, but some of them require numerous reference\ndata and the other part of them have cumbersome preprocessing steps to divide\nthe character into different parts to be learned and transferred separately. In\nthis paper, we propose a simple but powerful end-to-end Chinese calligraphy\nfont generation framework ZiGAN, which does not require any manual operation or\nredundant preprocessing to generate fine-grained target-style characters with\nfew-shot references. To be specific, a few paired samples from different\ncharacter styles are leveraged to attain a fine-grained correlation between\nstructures underlying different glyphs. To capture valuable style knowledge in\ntarget and strengthen the coarse-grained understanding of character content, we\nutilize multiple unpaired samples to align the feature distributions belonging\nto different character styles. By doing so, only a few target Chinese\ncalligraphy characters are needed to generated expected style transferred\ncharacters.

Here, we seek to characterize the computational demands\nfor abstract visual reasoning. We do this by systematically assessing the\nability of modern deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn to solve\nthe Synthetic Visual Reasoning Test (SVRT) challenge, a collection of\ntwenty-three visual reasoning problems. Our analysis leads to a novel taxonomy\nof visual reasoning tasks, which can be primarily explained by both the type of\nrelations (same-different vs. spatial-relation judgments) and the number of\nrelations used to compose the underlying rules. Prior cognitive neuroscience\nwork suggests that attention plays a key role in human's visual reasoning\nability. To test this, we extended the CNNs with spatial and feature-based\nattention mechanisms. In a second series of experiments, we evaluated the\nability of these attention networks to learn to solve the SVRT challenge and\nfound the resulting architectures to be much more efficient at solving the\nhardest of these visual reasoning tasks. Most importantly, the corresponding\nimprovements on individual tasks partially explained the taxonomy.

This technology promises to provide information on propagation\nenvironments and transceivers' location, thus creating several new services and\napplications for the Internet of Things and environment-aware communication.\nUsing crowdsourcing data collected by multiple agents appears to be much\npotential for enhancing SLAM performance. However, the measurement\nuncertainties in practice and biased estimations from multiple agents may\nresult in serious errors. This study develops a robust SLAM method with\nmeasurement plug-and-play and crowdsourcing mechanisms to address the above\nproblems. First, we divide measurements into different categories according to\ntheir unknown biases and realize a measurement plug-and-play mechanism by\nextending the classic belief propagation (BP)-based SLAM method.

However, action detection requires not\nonly categorizing actions, but also localizing them in untrimmed videos.\nTherefore, transferring knowledge pertaining to temporal relations is critical\nfor this task which is missing in the previous cross-modal KD frameworks. To\nthis end, we aim at learning an augmented RGB representation for action\ndetection, taking advantage of additional modalities at training time through\nKD. We propose a KD framework consisting of two levels of distillation. On one\nhand, atomic-level distillation encourages the RGB student to learn the\nsub-representation of the actions from the teacher in a contrastive manner. On\nthe other hand, sequence-level distillation encourages the student to learn the\ntemporal knowledge from the teacher, which consists of transferring the Global\nContextual Relations and the Action Boundary Saliency.

    "abstract": "Substantial increase in the use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has\nopened new frontiers for predictive healthcare. However, while EHR systems are\nnearly ubiquitous, they lack a unified code system for representing medical\nconcepts. Heterogeneous formats of EHR present a substantial barrier for the\ntraining and deployment of state-of-the-art deep learning models at scale. To\novercome this problem, we introduce Description-based Embedding, DescEmb, a\ncode-agnostic description-based representation learning framework for\npredictive modeling on EHR. DescEmb takes advantage of the flexibility of\nneural language understanding models while maintaining a neutral approach that\ncan be combined with prior frameworks for task-specific representation learning\nor predictive modeling. We tested our model's capacity on various experiments\nincluding prediction tasks, transfer learning and pooled learning. DescEmb\nshows higher performance in overall experiments compared to code-based\napproach, opening the door to a text-based approach in predictive healthcare\nresearch that is not constrained by EHR structure nor special domain knowledge.",

    "abstract": "The capsule network is a distinct and promising segment of the neural network\nfamily that drew attention due to its unique ability to maintain the\nequivariance property by preserving the spatial relationship amongst the\nfeatures. The capsule network has attained unprecedented success over image\nclassification tasks with datasets such as MNIST and affNIST by encoding the\ncharacteristic features into the capsules and building the parse-tree\nstructure. However, on the datasets involving complex foreground and background\nregions such as CIFAR-10, the performance of the capsule network is sub-optimal\ndue to its naive data routing policy and incompetence towards extracting\ncomplex features. This paper proposes a new design strategy for capsule network\narchitecture for efficiently dealing with complex images. The proposed method\nincorporates wide bottleneck residual modules and the Squeeze and Excitation\nattention blocks upheld by the modified FM routing algorithm to address the\ndefined problem. A wide bottleneck residual module facilitates extracting\ncomplex features followed by the squeeze and excitation attention block to\nenable channel-wise attention by suppressing the trivial features. This setup\nallows channel inter-dependencies at almost no computational cost, thereby\nenhancing the representation ability of capsules on complex images. We\nextensively evaluate the performance of the proposed model on three publicly\navailable datasets, namely CIFAR-10, Fashion MNIST, and SVHN, to outperform the\ntop-5 performance on CIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST with highly competitive\nperformance on the SVHN dataset.",

Recent studies on 2D\nobject detection show that the anchor-free methods also are of great potential.\nHowever, the unordered and sparse properties of point clouds prevent us from\ndirectly leveraging the advanced 2D methods on 3D point clouds. We overcome\nthis by converting the voxel-based sparse 3D feature volumes into the sparse 2D\nfeature maps. We propose an attentive module to fit the sparse feature maps to\ndense mostly on the object regions through the deformable convolution tower and\nthe supervised mask-guided attention. By directly regressing the 3D bounding\nbox from the enhanced and dense feature maps, we construct a novel single-stage\n3D detector for point clouds in an anchor-free manner.

    "abstract": "Fast arbitrary neural style transfer has attracted widespread attention from\nacademic, industrial and art communities due to its flexibility in enabling\nvarious applications. Existing solutions either attentively fuse deep style\nfeature into deep content feature without considering feature distributions, or\nadaptively normalize deep content feature according to the style such that\ntheir global statistics are matched. Although effective, leaving shallow\nfeature unexplored and without locally considering feature statistics, they are\nprone to unnatural output with unpleasing local distortions. To alleviate this\nproblem, in this paper, we propose a novel attention and normalization module,\nnamed Adaptive Attention Normalization (AdaAttN), to adaptively perform\nattentive normalization on per-point basis. Specifically, spatial attention\nscore is learnt from both shallow and deep features of content and style\nimages. Then per-point weighted statistics are calculated by regarding a style\nfeature point as a distribution of attention-weighted output of all style\nfeature points. Finally, the content feature is normalized so that they\ndemonstrate the same local feature statistics as the calculated per-point\nweighted style feature statistics. Besides, a novel local feature loss is\nderived based on AdaAttN to enhance local visual quality. We also extend\nAdaAttN to be ready for video style transfer with slight modifications.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art arbitrary\nimage/video style transfer.

    "abstract": "Alternative text is critical in communicating graphics to people who are\nblind or have low vision. Especially for graphics that contain rich\ninformation, such as visualizations, poorly written or an absence of\nalternative texts can worsen the information access inequality for people with\nvisual impairments. In this work, we consolidate existing guidelines and survey\ncurrent practices to inspect to what extent current practices and\nrecommendations are aligned. Then, to gain more insight into what people want\nin visualization alternative texts, we interviewed 22 people with visual\nimpairments regarding their experience with visualizations and their\ninformation needs in alternative texts. The study findings suggest that\nparticipants actively try to construct an image of visualizations in their head\nwhile listening to alternative texts and wish to carry out visualization tasks\n(e.g., retrieve specific values) as sighted viewers would. The study also\nprovides ample support for the need to reference the underlying data instead of\nvisual elements to reduce users' cognitive burden. Informed by the study, we\nprovide a set of recommendations to compose an informative alternative text.",

    "abstract": "Affordance detection refers to identifying the potential action possibilities\nof objects in an image, which is a crucial ability for robot perception and\nmanipulation. To empower robots with this ability in unseen scenarios, we first\nstudy the challenging one-shot affordance detection problem in this paper,\ni.e., given a support image that depicts the action purpose, all objects in a\nscene with the common affordance should be detected. To this end, we devise a\nOne-Shot Affordance Detection Network (OSAD-Net) that firstly estimates the\nhuman action purpose and then transfers it to help detect the common affordance\nfrom all candidate images. Through collaboration learning, OSAD-Net can capture\nthe common characteristics between objects having the same underlying\naffordance and learn a good adaptation capability for perceiving unseen\naffordances. Besides, we build a large-scale Purpose-driven Affordance Dataset\nv2 (PADv2) by collecting and labeling 30k images from 39 affordance and 103\nobject categories. With complex scenes and rich annotations, our PADv2 dataset\ncan be used as a test bed to benchmark affordance detection methods and may\nalso facilitate downstream vision tasks, such as scene understanding, action\nrecognition, and robot manipulation. Specifically, we conducted comprehensive\nexperiments on PADv2 dataset by including 11 advanced models from several\nrelated research fields. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of\nour model over previous representative ones in terms of both objective metrics\nand visual quality.

    "abstract": "A safety-critical measure of legged locomotion performance is a robot's\nability to track its desired time-varying position trajectory in an\nenvironment, which is herein termed as \"global-position tracking\". This paper\nintroduces a nonlinear control approach that achieves asymptotic\nglobal-position tracking for three-dimensional (3-D) bipedal robot walking.\nDesigning a global-position tracking controller presents a challenging problem\ndue to the complex hybrid robot model and the time-varying desired\nglobal-position trajectory. Towards tackling this problem, the first main\ncontribution is the construction of impact invariance to ensure all desired\ntrajectories respect the foot-landing impact dynamics, which is a necessary\ncondition for realizing asymptotic tracking of hybrid walking systems. Thanks\nto their independence of the desired global position, these conditions can be\nexploited to decouple the higher-level planning of the global position and the\nlower-level planning of the remaining trajectories, thereby greatly alleviating\nthe computational burden of motion planning. The second main contribution is\nthe Lyapunov-based stability analysis of the hybrid closed-loop system, which\nproduces sufficient conditions to guide the controller design for achieving\nasymptotic global-position tracking during fully actuated walking. Simulations\nand experiments on a 3-D bipedal robot with twenty revolute joints confirm the\nvalidity of the proposed control approach in guaranteeing accurate tracking.",

To monitor the pandemic trend, existing studies rely on\nthe aggregation of traditional statistical models and epidemic spread theory.\nIn other words, historical statistics of COVID-19, as well as the population\nmobility data, become the essential knowledge for monitoring the pandemic\ntrend. However, these solutions can barely provide precise prediction and\nsatisfactory explanations on the long-term disease surveillance while the\nubiquitous social media resources can be the key enabler for solving this\nproblem. For example, serious discussions may occur on social media before and\nafter some breaking events take place. These events, such as marathon and\nparade, may impact the spread of the virus. To take advantage of the social\nmedia data, we propose a novel framework, Social Media enhAnced pandemic\nsuRveillance Technique (SMART), which is composed of two modules: (i)\ninformation extraction module to construct heterogeneous knowledge graphs based\non the extracted events and relationships among them; (ii) time series\nprediction module to provide both short-term and long-term forecasts of the\nconfirmed cases and fatality at the state-level in the United States and to\ndiscover risk factors for COVID-19 interventions.

The way in which pathologists evaluate mitotic cell\ncount is to subjectively and qualitatively analyze cells present in stained\nslides of tissue and make a decision on its mitotic state i.e. is it mitotic or\nnot?This process is extremely inefficient and tiring for pathologists and so an\nefficient, accurate, and fully automated tool to aid with the diagnosis is\nextremely desirable.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised video object segmentation is a task of segmenting the target\nobject in a video sequence given only a mask annotation in the first frame. The\nlimited information available makes it an extremely challenging task. Most\nprevious best-performing methods adopt matching-based transductive reasoning or\nonline inductive learning. Nevertheless, they are either less discriminative\nfor similar instances or insufficient in the utilization of spatio-temporal\ninformation. In this work, we propose to integrate transductive and inductive\nlearning into a unified framework to exploit the complementarity between them\nfor accurate and robust video object segmentation. The proposed approach\nconsists of two functional branches. The transduction branch adopts a\nlightweight transformer architecture to aggregate rich spatio-temporal cues\nwhile the induction branch performs online inductive learning to obtain\ndiscriminative target information. To bridge these two diverse branches, a\ntwo-head label encoder is introduced to learn the suitable target prior for\neach of them. The generated mask encodings are further forced to be\ndisentangled to better retain their complementarity.

Previous work\nhas suggested such effects are limited to concepts that have strong, specific\nassociations with colors. However, although a concept may not be strongly\nassociated with any colors, its mapping can be disambiguated in the context of\nother concepts in an encoding system. We articulate this view in semantic\ndiscriminability theory, a general framework for understanding conditions\ndetermining when people can infer meaning from perceptual features. Semantic\ndiscriminability is the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping\nbetween visual features and concepts. Semantic discriminability theory posits\nthat the capacity for semantic discriminability for a set of concepts is\nconstrained by the difference between the feature-concept association\ndistributions across the concepts in the set. We define formal properties of\nthis theory and test its implications in two experiments. The results show that\nthe capacity to produce semantically discriminable colors for sets of concepts\nwas indeed constrained by the statistical distance between color-concept\nassociation distributions (Experiment 1). Moreover, people could interpret\nmeanings of colors in bar graphs insofar as the colors were semantically\ndiscriminable, even for concepts previously considered \"non-colorable\"\n(Experiment 2). The results suggest that colors are more robust for visual\ncommunication than previously thought.",

In case of a violation, a\ncounterexample that shows the erroneous behavior is returned. Understanding\nthese counterexamples is challenging, especially for hyperproperty\nspecifications, i.e., specifications that relate multiple executions of a\nsystem to each other. We aim to facilitate the visual analysis of such\ncounterexamples through our HyperVis tool, which provides interactive\nvisualizations of the given model, specification, and counterexample. Within an\niterative and interdisciplinary design process, we developed visualization\nsolutions that can effectively communicate the core aspects of the model\nchecking result. Specifically, we introduce graphical representations of binary\nvalues for improving pattern recognition, color encoding for better indicating\nrelated aspects, visually enhanced textual descriptions, as well as extensive\ncross-view highlighting mechanisms. Further, through an underlying causal\nanalysis of the counterexample, we are also able to identify values that\ncontributed to the violation and use this knowledge for both improved encoding\nand highlighting. Finally, the analyst can modify both the specification of the\nhyperproperty and the system directly within HyperVis and initiate the model\nchecking of the new version. In combination, these features notably support the\nanalyst in understanding the error leading to the counterexample as well as\niterating the provided system and specification.

Given\nan arbitrary textual search query, Open-vocabulary Visual Instance Search\n(OVIS) aims to return a ranked list of visual instances, i.e., image patches,\nthat satisfies the search intent from an image database. The term \"open\nvocabulary\" means that there are neither restrictions to the visual instance to\nbe searched nor restrictions to the word that can be used to compose the\ntextual search query. We propose to address such a search challenge via\nvisual-semantic aligned representation learning (ViSA). ViSA leverages massive\nimage-caption pairs as weak image-level (not instance-level) supervision to\nlearn a rich cross-modal semantic space where the representations of visual\ninstances (not images) and those of textual queries are aligned, thus allowing\nus to measure the similarities between any visual instance and an arbitrary\ntextual query. To evaluate the performance of ViSA, we build two datasets named\nOVIS40 and OVIS1600 and also introduce a pipeline for error analysis. Through\nextensive experiments on the two datasets, we demonstrate ViSA's ability to\nsearch for visual instances in images not available during training given a\nwide range of textual queries including those composed of uncommon words.\nExperimental results show that ViSA achieves an mAP@50 of 21.9% on OVIS40 under\nthe most challenging setting and achieves an mAP@6 of 14.9% on OVIS1600\ndataset.",

    "abstract": "Commodity applications contain more and more combinations of interacting\ncomponents (user, application, library, and system) and exhibit increasingly\ndiverse tradeoffs between isolation, performance, and programmability. We argue\nthat the challenge of future runtime isolation is best met by embracing the\nmulti-principle nature of applications, rethinking process architecture for\nfast and extensible intra-process isolation. We present, the Endokernel, a new\nprocess model and security architecture that nests an extensible monitor into\nthe standard process for building efficient least-authority abstractions. The\nEndokernel introduces a new virtual machine abstraction for representing\nsubprocess authority, which is enforced by an efficient self-isolating monitor\nthat maps the abstraction to system level objects (processes, threads, files,\nand signals). We show how the Endokernel can be used to develop specialized\nseparation abstractions using an exokernel-like organization to provide virtual\nprivilege rings, which we use to reorganize and secure NGINX. Our prototype,\nincludes a new syscall monitor, the nexpoline, and explores the tradeoffs of\nimplementing it with diverse mechanisms, including Intel Control Enhancement\nTechnology. Overall, we believe sub-process isolation is a must and that the\nEndokernel exposes an essential set of abstractions for realizing this in a\nsimple and feasible way.",

    "abstract": "One of the most important aspects of moving forward to the next generation\nnetworks like 5G/6G, is to enable network slicing in an efficient manner. The\nmost challenging issues are the uncertainties in consumption and communication\ndemand. Because the slices' arrive to the network in different times and their\nlifespans vary, the solution should dynamically react to online slice requests.\nThe joint problem of online admission control and resource allocation\nconsidering the energy consumption is formulated mathematically. It is based on\nInteger Linear Programming (ILP), where, the $\\Gamma$- Robustness concept is\nexploited to overcome Virtual Links (VL) bandwidths' and Virtual Network\nFunctions (VNF) workloads' uncertainties. Then, an optimal algorithm that\nadopts this mathematical model is proposed. To overcome the high computational\ncomplexity of ILP which is NP-hard, a new heuristic algorithm is developed. The\nassessments' results indicate that the efficiency of heuristic is vital in\nincreasing the accepted requests' count, decreasing power consumption and\nproviding adjustable tolerance vs. the VNFs workloads' and VLs traffics'\nuncertainties, separately. Considering the acceptance ratio and power\nconsumption that constitute the two important components of the objective\nfunction, heuristic has about 7% and 12% optimality gaps, respectively, while\nbeing about 30X faster than that of optimal algorithm.",

    "abstract": "This paper tackles the data-driven approximation of unknown dynamical systems\nusing Koopman-operator methods. Given a dictionary of functions, these methods\napproximate the projection of the action of the operator on the\nfinite-dimensional subspace spanned by the dictionary. We propose the Tunable\nSymmetric Subspace Decomposition algorithm to refine the dictionary, balancing\nits expressiveness and accuracy. Expressiveness corresponds to the ability of\nthe dictionary to describe the evolution of as many observables as possible and\naccuracy corresponds to the ability to correctly predict their evolution. Based\non the observation that Koopman-invariant subspaces give rise to exact\npredictions, we reason that prediction accuracy is a function of the degree of\ninvariance of the subspace generated by the dictionary and provide a\ndata-driven measure to measure invariance proximity. The proposed algorithm\niteratively prunes the initial functional space to identify a refined\ndictionary of functions that satisfies the desired level of accuracy while\nretaining as much of the original expressiveness as possible. We provide a full\ncharacterization of the algorithm properties and show that it generalizes both\nExtended Dynamic Mode Decomposition and Symmetric Subspace Decomposition.\nSimulations on planar systems show the effectiveness of the proposed methods in\nproducing Koopman approximations of tunable accuracy that capture relevant\ninformation about the dynamical system.",

    "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) on the graph with real-life\napplications are canonical challenges in Computer Science. The difficulty of\nfinding quality labels for problem instances holds back leveraging supervised\nlearning across combinatorial problems. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms\nhave recently been adopted to solve this challenge automatically. The\nunderlying principle of this approach is to deploy a graph neural network (GNN)\nfor encoding both the local information of the nodes and the graph-structured\ndata in order to capture the current state of the environment. Then, it is\nfollowed by the actor to learn the problem-specific heuristics on its own and\nmake an informed decision at each state for finally reaching a good solution.\nRecent studies on this subject mainly focus on a family of combinatorial\nproblems on the graph, such as the travel salesman problem, where the proposed\nmodel aims to find an ordering of vertices that optimizes a given objective\nfunction. We use the security-aware phone clone allocation in the cloud as a\nclassical quadratic assignment problem (QAP) to investigate whether or not deep\nRL-based model is generally applicable to solve other classes of such hard\nproblems.

In this work, a\ngradient-enhanced porosity defeaturing estimator, which allows for the modeling\nof pore geometry and spatial distribution, is proposed within a general\nelastostatic framework. In this approach, the first order shape sensitivity is\nimplemented to account for the change in elastic quantity of interests with\nrespect to variations of pore sizes and shapes, which is then supplemented by a\nsecond order shape sensitivity whose mixed partial derivative quantifies the\ninteractions between pores in proximity. The efficacy of the proposed method\ncomes from its posterior manner that it only relies on field solutions of\nreference models where pores are suppressed. In this context, meshing\ndifficulty and solution convergence issue are avoided, which would otherwise\narise in a direct finite element analysis on porous structures. The impact of\nporosity on structural elastic performance is approximated using a second order\nTaylor expansion where the topological difference between the porous and\nreference domains is estimated by topological sensitivity; the field variables\non pore boundaries are approximated as explicit functions of design variables\nusing exterior formulations.

In this paper, we propose a view-based deep learning\nmodel called Hierarchical View Predictor (HVP) to learn 3D shape features from\nunordered views in an unsupervised manner. To mine highly discriminative\ninformation from unordered views, HVP performs a novel hierarchical view\nprediction over a view pair, and aggregates the knowledge learned from the\npredictions in all view pairs into a global feature. In a view pair, we pose\nhierarchical view prediction as the task of hierarchically predicting a set of\nimage patches in a current view from its complementary set of patches, and in\naddition, completing the current view and its opposite from any one of the two\nsets of patches. Hierarchical prediction, in patches to patches, patches to\nview and view to view, facilitates HVP to effectively learn the structure of 3D\nshapes from the correlation between patches in the same view and the\ncorrelation between a pair of complementary views.

However, a computationally efficient framework to account for\nporosity with various shapes and sizes is still lacking. The main contribution\nof this work is to address this limitation. Specifically, a novel porosity\nsensitivity method is proposed, which integrates the merits of topological\nsensitivity and shape sensitivity. While topological sensitivity approximates\nthe first order change on the quantity of interest when an infinitesimally\nsmall spherical pore is inserted into a dense (no pore) structure, shape\nsensitivity estimates the subsequent change in the quantity when the small pore\nboundary is continuously perturbed to resemble the geometry reconstructed from\ntomography characterization data. In this method, an exterior problem is solved\nto explicitly formulate pore stress and strain fields as functions of shape\nscaling parameters. By neglecting higher order pore-to-pore interaction terms,\nthe influence of multiple pores can be estimated through a linear\napproximation. The proposed method is first studied on a benchmark example to\nestablish the impact of different pore parameters on the estimation accuracy.\nThe method is then applied onto case studies where the pore geometry is either\nfrom tomography reconstruction or computer-generated representations.\nEfficiency and accuracy of the method are finally demonstrated using a\ncommercial 3D application.

    "abstract": "Learning to generate 3D point clouds without 3D supervision is an important\nbut challenging problem. Current solutions leverage various differentiable\nrenderers to project the generated 3D point clouds onto a 2D image plane, and\ntrain deep neural networks using the per-pixel difference with 2D ground truth\nimages. However, these solutions are still struggling to fully recover fine\nstructures of 3D shapes, such as thin tubes or planes. To resolve this issue,\nwe propose an unsupervised approach for 3D point cloud generation with fine\nstructures. Specifically, we cast 3D point cloud learning as a 2D projection\nmatching problem. Rather than using entire 2D silhouette images as a regular\npixel supervision, we introduce structure adaptive sampling to randomly sample\n2D points within the silhouettes as an irregular point supervision, which\nalleviates the consistency issue of sampling from different view angles. Our\nmethod pushes the neural network to generate a 3D point cloud whose 2D\nprojections match the irregular point supervision from different view angles.\nOur 2D projection matching approach enables the neural network to learn more\naccurate structure information than using the per-pixel difference, especially\nfor fine and thin 3D structures.

    "abstract": "We consider two-alternative elections where voters' preferences depend on a\nstate variable that is not directly observable. Each voter receives a private\nsignal that is correlated to the state variable. Voters may be \"contingent\"\nwith different preferences in different states; or predetermined with the same\npreference in every state. In this setting, even if every voter is a contingent\nvoter, agents voting according to their private information need not result in\nthe adoption of the universally preferred alternative, because the signals can\nbe systematically biased.\nWe present an easy-to-deploy mechanism that elicits and aggregates the\nprivate signals from the voters, and outputs the alternative that is favored by\nthe majority. In particular, voters truthfully reporting their signals forms a\nstrong Bayes Nash equilibrium (where no coalition of voters can deviate and\nreceive a better outcome).",

Persistent data is no longer processed with\nserialized and transactional access, exposing applications to a range of\npotential concurrency anomalies that need to be handled by the application\nitself. Controlling concurrent data access in monolithic systems is already\nchallenging, but the problem is exacerbated in distributed systems. To make it\nworse, only little systematic engineering guidance is provided by the software\narchitecture community regarding this issue. Aims: In this paper, we report on\nour study of the effectiveness and applicability of the novel design guidelines\nwe are proposing in this regard. Method: We used action research and conducted\nit in the context of the software architecture design process of a multi-site\nplatform development project. Results: Our hypotheses regarding effectiveness\nand applicability have been accepted in the context of the study. The initial\ndesign guidelines were refined throughout the study. Thus, we also contribute\nconcrete guidelines for architecting distributed data-intensive systems with\neventually consistent data. The guidelines are an advancement of Domain-Driven\nDesign and provide additional patterns for the tactical design part.\nConclusions: Based on our results, we recommend using the guidelines to\narchitect safe eventually consistent systems. Because of the relevance of\ndistributed data-intensive systems, we will drive this research forward and\nevaluate it in further domains.",

Therefore, we present a descriptor-based\nadversarial de-biasing approach called `Protected Attribute Suppression System\n(PASS)'. PASS can be trained on top of descriptors obtained from any previously\ntrained high-performing network to classify identities and simultaneously\nreduce encoding of sensitive attributes. This eliminates the need for\nend-to-end training. As a component of PASS, we present a novel discriminator\ntraining strategy that discourages a network from encoding protected attribute\ninformation.

    "abstract": "Platooning strategy is an important part of autonomous driving technology.\nDue to the limited resource of autonomous vehicles in platoons, mobile edge\ncomputing (MEC) is usually used to assist vehicles in platoons to obtain useful\ninformation, increasing its safety. Specifically, vehicles usually adopt the\nIEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF) mechanism to transmit large\namount of data to the base station (BS) through vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)\ncommunications, where the useful information can be extracted by the edge\nserver connected to the BS and then sent back to the vehicles to make correct\ndecisions in time. However, vehicles may be moving on different lanes with\ndifferent velocities, which incurs the unfair access due to the characteristics\nof platoons, i.e., vehicles on different lanes transmit different amount of\ndata to the BS when they pass through the coverage of the BS, which also\nresults in the different amount of useful information received by various\nvehicles. Moreover, age of information (AoI) is an important performance metric\nto measure the freshness of the data. Large average age of data implies not\nreceiving the useful information in time. It is necessary to design an access\nscheme to jointly optimize the fairness and data freshness. In this paper, we\nformulate a joint optimization problem in the MEC-assisted V2I networks and\npresent a multi-objective optimization scheme to solve the problem through\nadjusting the minimum contention window under the IEEE 802.11 DCF mode\naccording to the velocities of vehicles.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a three-tier modality alignment approach to learning\ntext-image joint embedding, coined as JEMA, for cross-modal retrieval of\ncooking recipes and food images. The first tier improves recipe text embedding\nby optimizing the LSTM networks with term extraction and ranking enhanced\nsequence patterns, and optimizes the image embedding by combining the\nResNeXt-101 image encoder with the category embedding using wideResNet-50 with\nword2vec. The second tier modality alignment optimizes the textual-visual joint\nembedding loss function using a double batch-hard triplet loss with soft-margin\noptimization. The third modality alignment incorporates two types of\ncross-modality alignments as the auxiliary loss regularizations to further\nreduce the alignment errors in the joint learning of the two modality-specific\nembedding functions. The category-based cross-modal alignment aims to align the\nimage category with the recipe category as a loss regularization to the joint\nembedding. The cross-modal discriminator-based alignment aims to add the\nvisual-textual embedding distribution alignment to further regularize the joint\nembedding loss. Extensive experiments with the one-million recipes benchmark\ndataset Recipe1M demonstrate that the proposed JEMA approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art cross-modal embedding methods for both image-to-recipe and\nrecipe-to-image retrievals.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present our research on programming human-level artificial\nintelligence (HLAI), including 1) a definition of HLAI, 2) an environment to\ndevelop and test HLAI, and 3) a cognitive architecture for HLAI. The term AI is\nused in a broad meaning, and HLAI is not clearly defined. I claim that the\nessence of Human-Level Intelligence to be the capability to learn from others'\nexperiences via language. The key is that the event described by language has\nthe same effect as if the agent experiences it firsthand for the update of the\nbehavior policy. To develop and test models with such a capability, we are\ndeveloping a simulated environment called SEDRo. There is a 3D Home, and a\nmother character takes care of the baby (the learning agent) and teaches\nlanguages. The environment provides comparable experiences to that of a human\nbaby from birth to one year. Finally, I propose a cognitive architecture of\nHLAI called Modulated Heterarchical Prediction Memory (mHPM). In mHPM, there\nare three components: a universal module that learns to predict the next vector\ngiven the sequence of vector signals, a heterarchical network of those modules,\nand a reward-based modulation of learning. mHPM models the workings of the\nneocortex but the innate auxiliary units such hippocampus, reward system,\ninstincts, and amygdala play critical roles, too.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) are receiving increasing attention, and the\nmotion planning and control problem for these vehicles has become a hot\nresearch topic. In real applications such as material handling, an AGV is\nsubject to large uncertainties and its motion planning and control become\nchallenging. In this paper, we investigate this problem by proposing a\nhierarchical control scheme, which is integrated by a model predictive control\n(MPC) based path planning and trajectory tracking control at the high level,\nand a reduced-order extended state observer (RESO) based dynamic control at the\nlow level. The control at the high level consists of an MPC-based improved path\nplanner, a velocity planner, and an MPC-based tracking controller. Both the\npath planning and trajectory tracking control problems are formulated under an\nMPC framework. The control at the low level employs the idea of active\ndisturbance rejection control (ADRC). The uncertainties are estimated via a\nRESO and then compensated in the control in real-time. We show that, for the\nfirst-order uncertain AGV dynamic model, the RESO-based control only needs to\nknow the control direction. Finally, simulations and experiments on an AGV with\ndifferent payloads are conducted. The results illustrate that the proposed\nhierarchical control scheme achieves satisfactory motion planning and control\nperformance with large uncertainties.",

On the\nother hand, stroke optimization methods search for a set of stroke parameters\niteratively in a large search space; such low efficiency significantly limits\ntheir prevalence and practicality. Different from previous methods, in this\npaper, we formulate the task as a set prediction problem and propose a novel\nTransformer-based framework, dubbed Paint Transformer, to predict the\nparameters of a stroke set with a feed forward network. This way, our model can\ngenerate a set of strokes in parallel and obtain the final painting of size 512\n* 512 in near real time. More importantly, since there is no dataset available\nfor training the Paint Transformer, we devise a self-training pipeline such\nthat it can be trained without any off-the-shelf dataset while still achieving\nexcellent generalization capability.

Meanwhile, advances in adversarial\nmachine learning (ML) have shown that ML and reinforcement learning (RL) models\nare vulnerable to a variety of attacks that significantly degrade the\nperformance of learned behaviours. However, despite the obvious and growing\nimportance, the combination of adversarial ML and MACRL remains largely\nuninvestigated. In this paper, we make the first step towards conducting\nmessage attacks on MACRL methods. In our formulation, one agent in the\ncooperating group is taken over by an adversary and can send malicious messages\nto disrupt a deployed MACRL-based coordinated strategy during the deployment\nphase. We further our study by developing a defence method via message\nreconstruction. Finally, we address the resulting arms race, i.e., we consider\nthe ability of the malicious agent to adapt to the changing and improving\ndefensive communicative policies of the benign agents. Specifically, we model\nthe adversarial MACRL problem as a two-player zero-sum game and then utilize\nPolicy-Space Response Oracle to achieve communication robustness.

Few-shot-few-clue learning applies in this\nmisinformation detection task when the number of annotated statements is quite\nfew (called few shots) and the corresponding evidence is also quite limited in\neach shot (called few clues).

    "abstract": "Automated and accurate segmentation of the infected regions in computed\ntomography (CT) images is critical for the prediction of the pathological stage\nand treatment response of COVID-19. Several deep convolutional neural networks\n(DCNNs) have been designed for this task, whose performance, however, tends to\nbe suppressed by their limited local receptive fields and insufficient global\nreasoning ability. In this paper, we propose a pixel-wise sparse graph\nreasoning (PSGR) module and insert it into a segmentation network to enhance\nthe modeling of long-range dependencies for COVID-19 infected region\nsegmentation in CT images. In the PSGR module, a graph is first constructed by\nprojecting each pixel on a node based on the features produced by the\nsegmentation backbone, and then converted into a sparsely-connected graph by\nkeeping only K strongest connections to each uncertain pixel. The long-range\ninformation reasoning is performed on the sparsely-connected graph to generate\nenhanced features. The advantages of this module are two-fold: (1) the\npixel-wise mapping strategy not only avoids imprecise pixel-to-node projections\nbut also preserves the inherent information of each pixel for global reasoning;\nand (2) the sparsely-connected graph construction results in effective\ninformation retrieval and reduction of the noise propagation. The proposed\nsolution has been evaluated against four widely-used segmentation models on\nthree public datasets. The results show that the segmentation model equipped\nwith our PSGR module can effectively segment COVID-19 infected regions in CT\nimages, outperforming all other competing models.",

Biosystems have inspired many artificial systems because of their\nhigh efficiency and performance, so time-frequency localization has been used\nextensively to improve system performance. In the last few years, much work has\nbeen done to localize time-frequency information in ASR systems, which has used\nthe spatial immutability properties of methods such as TDNN, CNN and LSTM-RNN.\nHowever, most of these models have large parameter volumes and are challenging\nto train.

Then their output is concatenated and\napplied to a fully connected Maxout network for classification. To improve the\nperformance of this structure, we have used newly developed methods and models\nsuch as the maxout, Dropout, and weight normalization. Two experimental sets\nwere designed and implemented on the Persian FARSDAT speech data set to\nevaluate the performance of this model compared to conventional 1D-CMNN models.\nAccording to the experimental results, the average recognition score of TFCMNN\nmodels is about 1.6% higher than the average of conventional models.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel task, referred to as Weakly-Supervised\nSpatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection (WSSTAD) in surveillance video. Specifically,\ngiven an untrimmed video, WSSTAD aims to localize a spatio-temporal tube (i.e.,\na sequence of bounding boxes at consecutive times) that encloses the abnormal\nevent, with only coarse video-level annotations as supervision during training.\nTo address this challenging task, we propose a dual-branch network which takes\nas input the proposals with multi-granularities in both spatial-temporal\ndomains. Each branch employs a relationship reasoning module to capture the\ncorrelation between tubes/videolets, which can provide rich contextual\ninformation and complex entity relationships for the concept learning of\nabnormal behaviors. Mutually-guided Progressive Refinement framework is set up\nto employ dual-path mutual guidance in a recurrent manner, iteratively sharing\nauxiliary supervision information across branches. It impels the learned\nconcepts of each branch to serve as a guide for its counterpart, which\nprogressively refines the corresponding branch and the whole framework.\nFurthermore, we contribute two datasets, i.e., ST-UCF-Crime and STRA,\nconsisting of videos containing spatio-temporal abnormal annotations to serve\nas the benchmarks for WSSTAD. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative\nevaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and\nanalyze the key factors that contribute more to handle this task.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic balancing under uncertain disturbances is important for a humanoid\nrobot, which requires a good capability of coordinating the entire body\nredundancy to execute multi tasks. Whole-body control (WBC) based on\nhierarchical optimization has been generally accepted and utilized in\ntorque-controlled robots. A good hierarchy is the prerequisite for WBC and can\nbe predefined according to prior knowledge. However, the real-time computation\nwould be problematic in the physical applications considering the computational\ncomplexity of WBC. For robots with proprioceptive actuation, the joint friction\nin gear reducer would also degrade the torque tracking performance. In our\npaper, a reasonable hierarchy of tasks and constraints is first customized for\nrobot dynamic balancing. Then a real-time WBC is implemented via a\ncomputationally efficient WBC software. Such a method is solved on a modular\nmaster control system UBTMaster characterized by the real-time communication\nand powerful computing capability. After the joint friction being well covered\nby the model identification, extensive experiments on various balancing\nscenarios are conducted on a humanoid Walker3 with proprioceptive actuation.\nThe robot shows an outstanding balance performance even under external impulses\nas well as the two feet of the robot suffering the inclination and shift\ndisturbances independently. The results demonstrate that with the strict\nhierarchy, real-time computation and joint friction being handled carefully,\nthe robot with proprioceptive actuation can manage the dynamic physical\ninteractions with the unstructured environments well.",

To address these problems, in this paper we propose a\nnovel framework with several improvements: (1) we introduce Priors-Based\nRegularization to learn distribution knowledge from unpaired depth maps and\nprevent model from being incorrectly trained; (2) we leverage\nMapping-Consistent Image Enhancement module to enhance image visibility and\ncontrast while maintaining brightness consistency; and (3) we present\nStatistics-Based Mask strategy to tune the number of removed pixels within\ntextureless regions, using dynamic statistics.

Among different classes of NAS methods, evolutionary\ncomputation based NAS (ENAS) methods have recently gained much attention.\nUnfortunately, the issues of fair comparisons and efficient evaluations have\nhindered the development of ENAS. The current benchmark architecture datasets\ndesigned for fair comparisons only provide the datasets, not the ENAS\nalgorithms or the platform to run the algorithms. The existing efficient\nevaluation methods are either not suitable for the population-based ENAS\nalgorithm or are complex to use. This paper develops a platform named BenchENAS\nto address these issues and implements nine state-of-the-art ENAS algorithms.\nBenchENAS achieves fair comparisons by running different algorithms in the same\nenvironment and with the same settings. To achieve efficient evaluation in a\ncommon lab environment, BenchENAS designs a parallel component and a cache\ncomponent with high maintainability. Furthermore, BenchENAS is easy to install\nand highly configurable and modular, which brings benefits in good usability\nand easy extensibility. The paper conducts efficient comparison experiments on\neight ENAS algorithms with high GPU utilization on this platform. The\nexperiments validate that the fair comparison issue does exist, and BenchENAS\ncan alleviate this issue.

Maximum scores on Kannada and Malayalam were achieved by mBERT subjected\nto cross-entropy loss and with an approach of hard parameter sharing. Best\nscores on Tamil was achieved by DistilBERT subjected to cross-entropy loss with\nsoft parameter sharing as the architecture type. For the tasks of sentiment\nanalysis and offensive language identification, the best-performing model\nscored a weighted F1-score of (66.8\\% and 90.5\\%), (59\\% and 70\\%), and (62.1\\%\nand 75.3\\%) for Kannada, Malayalam, and Tamil on sentiment analysis and\noffensive language identification, respectively.

To tackle this\nchallenging problem, we introduce TransForensics, a novel image forgery\nlocalization method inspired by Transformers. The two major components in our\nframework are dense self-attention encoders and dense correction modules. The\nformer is to model global context and all pairwise interactions between local\npatches at different scales, while the latter is used for improving the\ntransparency of the hidden layers and correcting the outputs from different\nbranches. Compared to previous traditional and deep learning methods,\nTransForensics not only can capture discriminative representations and obtain\nhigh-quality mask predictions but is also not limited by tampering types and\npatch sequence orders. By conducting experiments on main benchmarks, we show\nthat TransForensics outperforms the stateof-the-art methods by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "The advances in deep neural networks (DNN) have significantly enhanced\nreal-time detection of anomalous data in IoT applications. However, the\ncomplexity-accuracy-delay dilemma persists: complex DNN models offer higher\naccuracy, but typical IoT devices can barely afford the computation load, and\nthe remedy of offloading the load to the cloud incurs long delay. In this\npaper, we address this challenge by proposing an adaptive anomaly detection\nscheme with hierarchical edge computing (HEC). Specifically, we first construct\nmultiple anomaly detection DNN models with increasing complexity, and associate\neach of them to a corresponding HEC layer. Then, we design an adaptive model\nselection scheme that is formulated as a contextual-bandit problem and solved\nby using a reinforcement learning policy network. We also incorporate a\nparallelism policy training method to accelerate the training process by taking\nadvantage of distributed models. We build an HEC testbed using real IoT\ndevices, implement and evaluate our contextual-bandit approach with both\nunivariate and multivariate IoT datasets. In comparison with both baseline and\nstate-of-the-art schemes, our adaptive approach strikes the best accuracy-delay\ntradeoff on the univariate dataset, and achieves the best accuracy and F1-score\non the multivariate dataset with only negligibly longer delay than the best\n(but inflexible) scheme.",

    "abstract": "Rain removal plays an important role in the restoration of degraded images.\nRecently, data-driven methods have achieved remarkable success. However, these\napproaches neglect that the appearance of rain is often accompanied by low\nlight conditions, which will further degrade the image quality. Therefore, it\nis very indispensable to jointly remove the rain and enhance the light for\nreal-world rain image restoration. In this paper, we aim to address this\nproblem from two aspects. First, we proposed a novel entangled network, namely\nEMNet, which can remove the rain and enhance illumination in one go.\nSpecifically, two encoder-decoder networks interact complementary information\nthrough entanglement structure, and parallel rain removal and illumination\nenhancement. Considering that the encoder-decoder structure is unreliable in\npreserving spatial details, we employ a detail recovery network to restore the\ndesired fine texture. Second, we present a new synthetic dataset, namely\nDarkRain, to boost the development of rain image restoration algorithms in\npractical scenarios. DarkRain not only contains different degrees of rain, but\nalso considers different lighting conditions, and more realistically simulates\nthe rainfall in the real world. EMNet is extensively evaluated on the proposed\nbenchmark and achieves state-of-the-art results. In addition, after a simple\ntransformation, our method outshines existing methods in both rain removal and\nlow-light image enhancement. The source code and dataset will be made publicly\navailable later.",

    "abstract": "It is known that for a discrete channel with correlated additive noise, the\nordinary capacity with or without feedback is equal $ \\log q-\\mathcal{H}_{ch}\n$, where $ \\mathcal{H}_{ch} $ is the entropy rate of the noise process and $ q\n$ is the alphabet size. In this paper, for a class of finite-state additive\nnoise channels, it is shown that the zero-error feedback capacity is either\nzero or $C_{0f} =\\log q -h_{ch} $, where $ h_{ch} $ is the {\\em topological\nentropy} of the noise process. A topological condition is given to determine\nwhen the zero-error capacity with or without feedback is zero. We explicitly\ncompute $ C_{0f}$ for several examples, including channels with isolated errors\nand a Gilbert-Elliot channel.\nFurthermore, the zero-error feedback capacity of a general channel model is\nrevisited and {\\em uniform zero-error feedback codes} are introduced. It is\nrevealed that there is a close connection between zero-error communication and\ncontrol of linear systems with bounded disturbances. A necessary and sufficient\ncondition for stabilization of unstable linear systems over general channels\nwith memory is obtained, assuming no state information at either end of the\nchannel. It is shown that $ C_{0f} $ is the figure of merit for determining\nwhen bounded stabilization is possible. This leads to a \"small-entropy\ntheorem\", stating that stabilization over finite-state additive noise channels\ncan be achieved if and only if the sum of the topological entropies of the\nlinear system and the channel is smaller than $\\log q$.",

We prove that this index includes the classical SSIM as a special\ncase, and we provide a precise connection between image similarity measured by\nthe cSSIM and by the $L_2$ norm.\nUsing this connection, we derive bounds on the cSSIM by means of bounds on\nthe $L_2$ error, and we even prove that the two error measures are equivalent\nin certain circumstances. We exploit these results to obtain precise rates of\nconvergence with respect to the cSSIM for several concrete image interpolation\nmethods, and we further validate these findings by many numerical experiments.\nThis newly established connection paves the way to obtain novel insights into\nthe features and limitations of the SSIM.",

However, NeRF methods do not\ngeneralize to novel scenes and are slow to train and test.

Our method uses only a sparse set of images as input and can generalize\nwell to novel scenes.

    "abstract": "We introduce FIFA, a fast approximate inference method for action\nsegmentation and alignment. Unlike previous approaches, FIFA does not rely on\nexpensive dynamic programming for inference. Instead, it uses an approximate\ndifferentiable energy function that can be minimized using gradient-descent.\nFIFA is a general approach that can replace exact inference improving its speed\nby more than 5 times while maintaining its performance. FIFA is an anytime\ninference algorithm that provides a better speed vs. accuracy trade-off\ncompared to exact inference. We apply FIFA on top of state-of-the-art\napproaches for weakly supervised action segmentation and alignment as well as\nfully supervised action segmentation. FIFA achieves state-of-the-art results on\nmost metrics on two action segmentation datasets.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of short-term OD Matrix (i.e. the distribution of\npassenger flows from various origins to destinations) is a crucial task in\nmetro systems. It is highly challenging due to the constantly changing nature\nof many impacting factors and the real-time de- layed data collection problem.\nRecently, some deep learning-based models have been proposed for OD Matrix\nforecasting in ride- hailing and high way traffic scenarios. However, these\nmodels can not sufficiently capture the complex spatiotemporal correlation\nbetween stations in metro networks due to their different prior knowledge and\ncontextual settings. In this paper we propose a hy- brid framework Multi-view\nTRGRU to address OD metro matrix prediction. In particular, it uses three\nmodules to model three flow change patterns: recent trend, daily trend, weekly\ntrend. In each module, a multi-view representation based on embedding for each\nstation is constructed and fed into a transformer based gated re- current\nstructure so as to capture the dynamic spatial dependency in OD flows of\ndifferent stations by a global self-attention mecha- nism. Extensive\nexperiments on three large-scale, real-world metro datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our Multi-view TRGRU over other competitors.",

    "abstract": "Hashing learns compact binary codes to store and retrieve massive data\nefficiently. Particularly, unsupervised deep hashing is supported by powerful\ndeep neural networks and has the desirable advantage of label independence. It\nis a promising technique for scalable image retrieval. However, deep models\nintroduce a large number of parameters, which is hard to optimize due to the\nlack of explicit semantic labels and brings considerable training cost. As a\nresult, the retrieval accuracy and training efficiency of existing unsupervised\ndeep hashing are still limited. To tackle the problems, in this paper, we\npropose a simple and efficient \\emph{Lightweight Augmented Graph Network\nHashing} (LAGNH) method with a two-pronged strategy. For one thing, we extract\nthe inner structure of the image as the auxiliary semantics to enhance the\nsemantic supervision of the unsupervised hash learning process. For another, we\ndesign a lightweight network structure with the assistance of the auxiliary\nsemantics, which greatly reduces the number of network parameters that needs to\nbe optimized and thus greatly accelerates the training process. Specifically,\nwe design a cross-modal attention module based on the auxiliary semantic\ninformation to adaptively mitigate the adverse effects in the deep image\nfeatures. Besides, the hash codes are learned by multi-layer message passing\nwithin an adversarial regularized graph convolutional network. Simultaneously,\nthe semantic representation capability of hash codes is further enhanced by\nreconstructing the similarity graph.",

As first stage retrieval methods combined\nwith neural re-ranking methods using contextualized language models like BERT\nachieved great performance improvements for information retrieval in the web\nand news domain, we evaluate these methods for the legal domain. A distinct\ncharacteristic of legal case retrieval is that the query case and case\ndescription in the corpus tend to be long documents and therefore exceed the\ninput length of BERT. We address this challenge by combining lexical and dense\nretrieval methods on the paragraph-level of the cases for the first stage\nretrieval.

It is then shown that deductions in the\nsystem convert into normal form, i.e. deductions that contain neither maximal\nformulas nor maximal segments, and that deductions in normal form satisfy the\nsubformula property. Tarski's Rule is treated as a general introduction rule\nfor implication. The general introduction rule for negation has a similar form.\nMaximal formulas with implication or negation as main operator require\nreduction procedures of a more intricate kind not present in normalisation for\nintuitionist logic.",

    "abstract": "The work of McCloskey and Cohen popularized the concept of catastrophic\ninterference. They used a neural network that tried to learn addition using two\ngroups of examples as two different tasks. In their case, learning the second\ntask rapidly deteriorated the acquired knowledge about the previous one. This\ncould be a symptom of a fundamental problem: addition is an algorithmic task\nthat should not be learned through pattern recognition. We propose to use a\nneural network with a different architecture that can be trained to recover the\ncorrect algorithm for the addition of binary numbers. We test it in the setting\nproposed by McCloskey and Cohen and training on random examples one by one. The\nneural network not only does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting but it\nimproves its predictive power on unseen pairs of numbers as training\nprogresses. This work emphasizes the importance that neural network\narchitecture has for the emergence of catastrophic forgetting and introduces a\nneural network that is able to learn an algorithm.",

Our analysis is based on the use of a hyperparameters-dependent\nstochastic differential equation (hp-dependent SDE) that serves as a continuous\nsurrogate for SGD with momentum.

Since, a large proportion of renewables are\nintermittent generations, maintaining production and consumption balance of the\nelectric system is at stake. The DSO needs to procure flexibilities not only\nfrom large resources, but also small-scale resources connected to the LV grid.\nTherefore, there is a need to estimate the aggregate flexibility at the\nsecondary substation available from the LV grids. The flexibility estimation\ncan only be achieved through monitoring of LV grid and the distributed energy\nresources (DERs) connected at the LV level. Moreover, the variability of\nintermittent resources affects the flexibility estimation methodology, and the\nDSO operation must be robust to the changes in generation or demand outputs.\nFurthermore, the up-to-date and accurate model of the LV grid is difficult to\naccess. This paper demonstrates a methodology of estimating flexibility by\nsensitivity coefficients and thus, eliminating the need to have an up-to-date\nLV grid model. It further presents a robust optimisation based methodology for\ngrid operation to address the impact of forecast uncertainties associated with\nthe variable DER output.

    "title": "A multiscale analysis of instability-induced failure mechanisms in  fiber-reinforced composite structures via alternative modeling approaches",
    "abstract": "Multiscale techniques have been widely shown to potentially overcome the\nlimitation of homogenization schemes in representing the microscopic failure\nmechanisms in heterogeneous media as well as their influence on their\nstructural response at the macroscopic level. Such techniques allow the use of\nfully detailed models to be avoided, thus resulting in a notable decrease in\nthe overall computational cost at fixed numerical accuracy compared to the\nso-called direct numerical simulations. In the present work, two different\nmultiscale modeling approaches are presented for the analysis of\nmicrostructural instability-induced failure in locally periodic\nfiber-reinforced composite materials subjected to general loading conditions\ninvolving large deformations. The first approach, which is of a semi-concurrent\nkind, consists in the on-the-fly derivation of the macroscopic constitutive\nresponse of the composite structure together with its microscopic stability\nproperties through a two-way computational homogenization scheme. The latter\none is a novel hybrid hierarchical-concurrent multiscale approach relying on a\ntwo-level domain decomposition scheme used in conjunction with a nonlinear\nhomogenization scheme performed at the preprocessing stage. Both multiscale\napproaches have been suitably validated through comparisons with reference\ndirect numerical simulations, by which the ability of the latter approach in\ncapturing boundary layer effects has been demonstrated.",

Recently, deep learning shows its ability to solve many real\nworld problems, e.g. image classification and detection, natural language\nprocessing, playing GO. Theoretically speaking, an artificial neural network\ncan fit any function and reinforcement learning can learn from any delayed\nreward. But in solving real world tasks, we still need to spend a lot of effort\nto adjust algorithms to fit task unique features. This paper proposes that the\nreason of this phenomenon is the sparse feedback feature of the nature, and a\nsingle algorithm, no matter how we improve it, can only solve dense feedback\ntasks or specific sparse feedback tasks. This paper first analyses how sparse\nfeedback affects algorithm perfomance, and then proposes a pattern that\nexplains how to accumulate knowledge to solve sparse feedback problems.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, artificial neural networks are widely used for users' online travel\nplanning. Personalized travel planning has many real applications and is\naffected by various factors, such as transportation type, intention destination\nestimation, budget limit and crowdness prediction. Among those factors, users'\nintention destination prediction is an essential task in online travel\nplatforms. The reason is that, the user may be interested in the travel plan\nonly when the plan matches his real intention destination. Therefore, in this\npaper, we focus on predicting users' intention destinations in online travel\nplatforms. In detail, we act as online travel platforms (such as Fliggy and\nAirbnb) to recommend travel plans for users, and the plan consists of various\nvacation items including hotel package, scenic packages and so on. Predicting\nthe actual intention destination in travel planning is challenging. Firstly,\nusers' intention destination is highly related to their travel status (e.g.,\nplanning for a trip or finishing a trip). Secondly, users' actions (e.g.\nclicking, searching) over different product types (e.g. train tickets, visa\napplication) have different indications in destination prediction. Thirdly,\nusers may mostly visit the travel platforms just before public holidays, and\nthus user behaviors in online travel platforms are more sparse, low-frequency\nand long-period. Therefore, we propose a Deep Multi-Sequences fused neural\nNetworks (DMSN) to predict intention destinations from fused multi-behavior\nsequences. Real datasets are used to evaluate the performance of our proposed\nDMSN models. Experimental results indicate that the proposed DMSN models can\nachieve high intention destination prediction accuracy.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an efficient parallelization strategy for boundary\nelement method (BEM) solvers that perform the electromagnetic analysis of\nstructures with lossy conductors. The proposed solver is accelerated with the\nadaptive integral method, can model both homogeneous and multilayered\nbackground media, and supports excitation via lumped ports or an incident\nfield. Unlike existing parallel BEM solvers, we use a formulation that\nrigorously models the skin effect, which results in two coupled computational\nworkloads. The external-problem workload models electromagnetic coupling\nbetween conductive objects, while the internal-problem workload describes field\ndistributions within them. We propose a parallelization strategy that\ndistributes these two workloads evenly over thousands of processing cores. The\nexternal-problem workload is balanced in the same manner as existing parallel\nsolvers that employ approximate models for conductive objects. However, we\nassert that the internal-problem workload should be balanced by algorithms from\nscheduling theory. The parallel scalability of the proposed solver is tested on\nthree different structures found in both integrated circuits and metasurfaces.\nThe proposed parallelization strategy runs efficiently on distributed-memory\ncomputers with thousands of CPU cores and outperforms competing strategies\nderived from existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Using simulation to predict the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous\nmaterials has applications ranging from topology optimization to multi-scale\nstructural analysis. However, full-fidelity simulation techniques such as\nFinite Element Analysis can be prohibitively computationally expensive when\nthey are used to explore the massive input parameter space of heterogeneous\nmaterials. Therefore, there has been significant recent interest in machine\nlearning-based models that, once trained, can predict mechanical behavior at a\nfraction of the computational cost. Over the past several years, research in\nthis area has been focused mainly on predicting single Quantities of Interest\n(QoIs). However, there has recently been an increased interest in a more\nchallenging problem: predicting full-field QoI (e.g., displacement/strain\nfields, damage fields) for mechanical problems. Due to the added complexity of\nfull-field information, network architectures that perform well on single QoI\nproblems may perform poorly in the full-field QoI problem setting. The work\npresented in this paper is twofold. First, we made a significant extension to\nthe Mechanical MNIST dataset designed to enable the investigation of full field\nQoI prediction. Specifically, we added Finite Element simulation results of\nquasi-static brittle fracture in a heterogeneous material captured with the\nphase-field method. Second, we established strong baseline performance for\npredicting full-field QoI with MultiRes-WNet architecture. In addition to\npresenting the results in this paper, we have released our model implementation\nand the Mechanical MNIST Crack Path dataset under open-source licenses. We\nanticipate that future researchers will directly use our model architecture on\nrelated datasets and potentially design models that exceed the baseline\nperformance for predicting full-field QoI established in this paper.",

The statistical results are used to evaluate\nthe potential impact of user behaviors on network traffic. This requires\nalgorithms that are capable of storing and retrieving a high volume of IP\naddresses within time and memory constraints. In this paper, we present two\nefficient algorithms for collecting the statistics of large-scale IP addresses\nthat balance time efficiency and memory consumption. The proposed solutions\ntake into account the sparse nature of the statistics of IP addresses while\nbuilding the hash function and maintain a dynamic balance among layered memory\nblocks. There are two layers in the first proposed method, each of which\ncontains a limited number of memory blocks. Each memory block contains 256\nelements of size $256 \\times 8$ bytes for a 64-bit system. In contrast to\nbuilt-in hash mapping functions, the proposed solution completely avoids\nexpensive hash collisions while retaining the linear time complexity of\nhash-based solutions. Moreover, the mechanism dynamically determines the hash\nindex length according to the range of IP addresses, and can balance the time\nand memory constraints. In addition, we propose an efficient parallel scheme to\nspeed up the collection of statistics. The experimental results on several\nsynthetic datasets show that the proposed method substantially outperforms the\nbaselines with respect to time and memory space efficiency.",

It\nhas versatile application potentials such as in the area of human-robot\ninteractions, human action tracking for airport security systems, autonomous\ncar navigation, computer gaming to name a few. However, predicting human motion\nbased on past actions is an extremely challenging task due to the difficulties\nin detecting spatial and temporal features correctly. To detect temporal\nfeatures in human poses, we propose an Inception Residual Block(IRB), due to\nits inherent capability of processing multiple kernels to capture salient\nfeatures. Here, we propose to use multiple 1-D Convolution Neural Network (CNN)\nwith different kernel sizes and input sequence lengths and concatenate them to\nget proper embedding. As kernels strides over different receptive fields, they\ndetect smaller and bigger salient features at multiple temporal scales. Our\nmain contribution is to propose a residual connection between input and the\noutput of the inception block to have a continuity between the previously\nobserved pose and the next predicted pose. With this proposed architecture, it\nlearns prior knowledge much better about human poses and we achieve much higher\nprediction accuracy as detailed in the paper. Subsequently, we further propose\nto feed the output of the inception residual block as an input to the Graph\nConvolution Neural Network (GCN) due to its better spatial feature learning\ncapability. We perform a parametric analysis for better designing of our model\nand subsequently, we evaluate our approach on the Human 3.6M dataset and\ncompare our short-term as well as long-term predictions with the state of the\nart papers, where our model outperforms most of the pose results, the detailed\nreasons of which have been elaborated in the paper.",

    "title": "FOLASP: FO(.) as Input Language for Answer Ser Solvers",
    "abstract": "Over the past decades, Answer Set Programming (ASP) has emerged as an\nimportant paradigm for declarative problem solving. Technological progress in\nthis area has been stimulated by the use of common standards, such as the\nASP-Core-2 language. While ASP has its roots in non-monotonic reasoning,\nefforts have also been made to reconcile ASP with classical first-order logic\n(FO). This has resulted in the development of FO(.), an expressive extension of\nFO, which allows ASP-like problem solving in a purely classical setting. This\nlanguage may be more accessible to domain experts already familiar with FO, and\nmay be easier to combine with other formalisms that are based on classical\nlogic. It is supported by the IDP inference system, which has successfully\ncompeted in a number of ASP competitions. Here, however, technological progress\nhas been hampered by the limited number of systems that are available for\nFO(.). In this paper, we aim to address this gap by means of a translation tool\nthat transforms an FO(.) specification into ASP-Core-2, thereby allowing\nASP-Core-2 solvers to be used as solvers for FO(.) as well. We present\nexperimental results to show that the resulting combination of our translation\nwith an off-the-shelf ASP solver is competitive with the IDP system as a way of\nsolving problems formulated in FO(.).\nUnder consideration for acceptance in TPLP.",

    "abstract": "The ability to segment unknown objects in cluttered scenes has a profound\nimpact on robot grasping. The rise of deep learning has greatly transformed the\npipeline of robotic grasping from model-based approach to data-driven stream,\nwhich generally requires a large scale of grasping data either collected in\nsimulation or from real-world examples. In this paper, we proposed a\nsim-to-real framework to transfer the object segmentation model learned in\nsimulation to the real-world. First, data samples are collected in simulation,\nincluding RGB, 6D pose, and point cloud. Second, we also present a GAN-based\nunknown object segmentation method through domain adaptation, which consists of\nan image translation module and an image segmentation module. The image\ntranslation module is used to shorten the reality gap and the segmentation\nmodule is responsible for the segmentation mask generation. We used the above\nmethod to perform segmentation experiments on unknown objects in a bin-picking\nscenario. Finally, the experimental result shows that the segmentation model\nlearned in simulation can be used for real-world data segmentation.",

In point cloud processing,\ndifferent representations have their own pros and cons. Thus, finding suitable\nways to represent point cloud data structure while keeping its own internal\nphysical property such as permutation and scale-invariant is a fundamental\nproblem. Therefore, we propose our work, DRINet, which serves as the basic\nnetwork structure for dual-representation learning with great flexibility at\nfeature transferring and less computation cost, especially for large-scale\npoint clouds. DRINet mainly consists of two modules called Sparse Point-Voxel\nFeature Extraction and Sparse Voxel-Point Feature Extraction.

We further propose a novel multi-scale pooling layer for\npointwise locality learning to improve context information propagation.

However, relying on user interaction data is problematic because one\nfirst needs a massive user base to build a sufficient log; public query logs\nare insufficient on their own. Given the recent success of causal language\nmodels (such as the Text-To-Text Transformer (T5) model) at text generation\ntasks, we explore the capacity of these models to generate potential query\nintents. We find that to encourage diversity in the generated queries, it is\nbeneficial to adapt the model by including a new Distributional Causal Language\nModeling (DCLM) objective during fine-tuning and a representation replacement\nduring inference. Across six standard evaluation benchmarks, we find that our\nmethod (which we call IntenT5) improves search result diversity and attains\n(and sometimes exceeds) the diversity obtained when using query suggestions\nbased on a proprietary query log.

    "abstract": "In the current deep learning based recommendation system, the embedding\nmethod is generally employed to complete the conversion from the\nhigh-dimensional sparse feature vector to the low-dimensional dense feature\nvector. However, as the dimension of the input vector of the embedding layer is\ntoo large, the addition of the embedding layer significantly slows down the\nconvergence speed of the entire neural network, which is not acceptable in\nreal-world scenarios. In addition, as the interaction between users and items\nincreases and the relationship between items becomes more complicated, the\nembedding method proposed for sequence data is no longer suitable for graphic\ndata in the current real environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the\nDual-modal Graph Embedding Method (DGEM) to solve these problems. DGEM includes\ntwo modes, static and dynamic. We first construct the item graph to extract the\ngraph structure and use random walk of unequal probability to capture the\nhigh-order proximity between the items. Then we generate the graph embedding\nvector through the Skip-Gram model, and finally feed the downstream deep neural\nnetwork for the recommendation task. The experimental results show that DGEM\ncan mine the high-order proximity between items and enhance the expression\nability of the recommendation model.

    "abstract": "Deep neural network (DNN) models have achieved phenomenal success for\napplications in many domains, ranging from academic research in science and\nengineering to industry and business. The modeling power of DNN is believed to\nhave come from the complexity and over-parameterization of the model, which on\nthe other hand has been criticized for the lack of interpretation. Although\ncertainly not true for every application, in some applications, especially in\neconomics, social science, healthcare industry, and administrative decision\nmaking, scientists or practitioners are resistant to use predictions made by a\nblack-box system for multiple reasons. One reason is that a major purpose of a\nstudy can be to make discoveries based upon the prediction function, e.g., to\nreveal the relationships between measurements. Another reason can be that the\ntraining dataset is not large enough to make researchers feel completely sure\nabout a purely data-driven result. Being able to examine and interpret the\nprediction function will enable researchers to connect the result with existing\nknowledge or gain insights about new directions to explore. Although classic\nstatistical models are much more explainable, their accuracy often falls\nconsiderably below DNN. In this paper, we propose an approach to fill the gap\nbetween relatively simple explainable models and DNN such that we can more\nflexibly tune the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy. Our main\nidea is a mixture of discriminative models that is trained with the guidance\nfrom a DNN.

    "abstract": "Sensing systems powered by energy harvesting have traditionally been designed\nto tolerate long periods without energy. As the Internet of Things (IoT)\nevolves towards a more transient and opportunistic execution paradigm, reducing\nenergy storage costs will be key for its economic and ecologic viability.\nHowever, decreasing energy storage in harvesting systems introduces reliability\nissues. Transducers only produce intermittent energy at low voltage and current\nlevels, making guaranteed task completion a challenge. Existing ad hoc methods\novercome this by buffering enough energy either for single tasks, incurring\nlarge data-retention overheads, or for one full application cycle, requiring a\nlarge energy buffer. We present Julienning: an automated method for optimizing\nthe total energy cost of batteryless applications. Using a custom specification\nmodel, developers can describe transient applications as a set of atomically\nexecuted kernels with explicit data dependencies. Our optimization flow can\npartition data- and energy-intensive applications into multiple execution\ncycles with bounded energy consumption. By leveraging interkernel data\ndependencies, these energy-bounded execution cycles minimize the number of\nsystem activations and nonvolatile data transfers, and thus the total energy\noverhead. We validate our methodology with two batteryless cameras running\nenergy-intensive machine learning applications. Results demonstrate that\ncompared to ad hoc solutions, our method can reduce the required energy storage\nby over 94% while only incurring a 0.12% energy overhead.",

    "abstract": "Training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a strict Lipschitz\nconstraint under the l_{2} norm is useful for provable adversarial robustness,\ninterpretable gradients and stable training. While 1-Lipschitz CNNs can be\ndesigned by enforcing a 1-Lipschitz constraint on each layer, training such\nnetworks requires each layer to have an orthogonal Jacobian matrix (for all\ninputs) to prevent gradients from vanishing during backpropagation. A layer\nwith this property is said to be Gradient Norm Preserving (GNP). To construct\nexpressive GNP activation functions, we first prove that the Jacobian of any\nGNP piecewise linear function is only allowed to change via Householder\ntransformations for the function to be continuous. Building on this result, we\nintroduce a class of nonlinear GNP activations with learnable Householder\ntransformations called Householder activations. A householder activation\nparameterized by the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ outputs $(\\mathbf{I} -\n2\\mathbf{v}\\mathbf{v}^{T})\\mathbf{z}$ for its input $\\mathbf{z}$ if\n$\\mathbf{v}^{T}\\mathbf{z} \\leq 0$; otherwise it outputs $\\mathbf{z}$. Existing\nGNP activations such as $\\mathrm{MaxMin}$ can be viewed as special cases of\n$\\mathrm{HH}$ activations for certain settings of these transformations. Thus,\nnetworks with $\\mathrm{HH}$ activations have higher expressive power than those\nwith $\\mathrm{MaxMin}$ activations. Although networks with $\\mathrm{HH}$\nactivations have nontrivial provable robustness against adversarial attacks, we\nfurther boost their robustness by (i) introducing a certificate regularization\nand (ii) relaxing orthogonalization of the last layer of the network. Our\nexperiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our regularized networks with\n$\\mathrm{HH}$ activations lead to significant improvements in both the standard\nand provable robust accuracy over the prior works (gain of 3.65\\% and 4.46\\% on\nCIFAR-100 respectively).",

    "abstract": "As more and more renewable intermittent generations are being connected to\nthe distribution grid, the grid operators require more flexibility to maintain\nthe balance between supply and demand. The intermittencies give rise to\nsituations which require not only slow-ramping flexibility capability but also,\nfast-ramping flexibility capability from a variety of resources connected at\nthe MV and LV distribution grids. Moreover, the intermittencies may increase\nthe costs of grid reinforcement. Therefore, to defer the reinforcement of the\ngrid assets, the grid needs to be operated optimally. This paper proposes - a)\nsuch an optimal operational methodology for the MV and LV grids; and b) an\naggregated flexibility estimation methodology estimated separately for fast and\nslow services at the primary substation (TSO interface). The methodologies\nbased on model-based MV grids and a sensitivity coefficients-based model-less\nLV grids are suitable for LV grids where an up-to-date and accurate model and\ntopology are not always available. The approaches of the paper use the\nsynchronised and accurate measurements from grid monitoring devices located at\nthe LV distribution grids. It is assumed that the implementation of the\nmethodology is centralised, where a grid monitoring device or a central\nplatform is capable to host grid aware algorithms and to communicate control\nsetpoints to DERs. The approaches have been validated on a real MV and LV\nnetworks of a Swiss DSO equipped with grid monitoring devices. The results, in\nterms of technical losses, grid violation costs and flexibility capability\ncurve, show the efficacy of the optimal operation and flexibility estimation\nmethodologies and therefore, can be easily deployed.",

    "abstract": "Scientific machine learning has been successfully applied to inverse problems\nand PDE discoveries in computational physics. One caveat of current methods\nhowever is the need for large amounts of (clean) data in order to recover full\nsystem responses or underlying physical models. Bayesian methods may be\nparticularly promising to overcome these challenges as they are naturally less\nsensitive to sparse and noisy data. In this paper, we propose to use Bayesian\nneural networks (BNN) in order to: 1) Recover the full system states from\nmeasurement data (e.g. temperature, velocity field, etc.). We use Hamiltonian\nMonte-Carlo to sample the posterior distribution of a deep and dense BNN, and\nshow that it is possible to accurately capture physics of varying complexity\nwithout overfitting. 2) Recover the parameters in the underlying partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) governing the physical system. Using the trained\nBNN as a surrogate of the system response, we generate datasets of derivatives\npotentially comprising the latent PDE of the observed system and perform a\nBayesian linear regression (BLR) between the successive derivatives in space\nand time to recover the original PDE parameters. We take advantage of the\nconfidence intervals on the BNN outputs and introduce the spatial derivative\nvariance into the BLR likelihood to discard the influence of highly uncertain\nsurrogate data points, which allows for more accurate parameter discovery.

Two prior protocols, Wi-SUN Field Area Network\n(Wi-SUN FAN) and IETF 6TiSCH standards, are popularly used that are\nrespectively based on asynchronous Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision\nAvoidance (CSMA/CA) and IEEE 802.15.4 Time Scheduled Channel Hopping (TSCH).\nHowever, the former one with CSMA/CA can be prone to the Hidden Node Problem\n(HNP) that leads to a degradation of reliability, while the latter one with\nTSCH avoids HNP by using synchronously scheduling but requires massive control\nsignalling that degrades the upper-bound of throughput.

Most\nalgorithms have solely relied on the vector-based motion representation and\nresampling (e.g., optical flow based bilinear sampling) for exploiting the\ninter frame redundancy. In spite of the great success of adaptive kernel-based\nresampling (e.g., adaptive convolutions and deformable convolutions) in video\nprediction for uncompressed videos, integrating such approaches with\nrate-distortion optimization for inter frame coding has been less successful.\nRecognizing that each resampling solution offers unique advantages in regions\nwith different motion and texture characteristics, we propose a hybrid motion\ncompensation (HMC) method that adaptively combines the predictions generated by\nthese two approaches. Specifically, we generate a compound spatiotemporal\nrepresentation (CSTR) through a recurrent information aggregation (RIA) module\nusing information from the current and multiple past frames. We further design\na one-to-many decoder pipeline to generate multiple predictions from the CSTR,\nincluding vector-based resampling, adaptive kernel-based resampling,\ncompensation mode selection maps and texture enhancements, and combines them\nadaptively to achieve more accurate inter prediction. Experiments show that our\nproposed inter coding system can provide better motion-compensated prediction\nand is more robust to occlusions and complex motions. Together with jointly\ntrained intra coder and residual coder, the overall learnt hybrid coder yields\nthe state-of-the-art coding efficiency in low-delay scenario, compared to the\ntraditional H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC, as well as recently published\nlearning-based methods, in terms of both PSNR and MS-SSIM metrics.",

    "abstract": "Despite huge successes reported by the field of machine learning, such as\nspeech assistants or self-driving cars, businesses still observe very high\nfailure rate when it comes to deployment of ML in production. We argue that\npart of the reason is infrastructure that was not designed for activities\naround data collection and analysis. We propose to consider flow-based\nprogramming with data streams as an alternative to commonly used\nservice-oriented architectures for building software applications. To compare\nflow-based programming with the widespread service-oriented approach, we\ndevelop a data processing application, and formulate two subsequent ML-related\ntasks that constitute a complete cycle of ML deployment while allowing us to\nassess characteristics of each programming paradigm in the ML context.\nEmploying both code metrics and empirical observations, we show that when it\ncomes to ML deployment each paradigm has certain advantages and drawbacks. Our\nmain conclusion is that while FBP shows great potential for providing\ninfrastructural benefits for deployment of machine learning, it requires a lot\nof boilerplate code to define and manipulate the dataflow graph. We believe\nthat with better developer tools in place this problem can be alleviated,\nestablishing FBP as a strong alternative to currently prevalent SOA-driven\nsoftware design approach. Additionally, we provide an insight into the trend of\nprioritising model development over data quality management.",

We use channel models for recently proposed\nfew-shot learning methods with no or very limited updates to the language model\nparameters, via either in-context demonstration or prompt tuning. Our\nexperiments show that, for both methods, channel models significantly\noutperform their direct counterparts, which we attribute to their stability,\ni.e., lower variance and higher worst-case accuracy. We also present extensive\nablations that provide recommendations for when to use channel prompt tuning\ninstead of other competitive models (e.g., direct head tuning): channel prompt\ntuning is preferred when the number of training examples is small, labels in\nthe training data are imbalanced, or generalization to unseen labels is\nrequired.",

Historical documents are, therefore,\nan important piece in the understanding of the impact and consequences of land\nusage change. This, in turn, is important in the search of restoration projects\nthat can be conducted to turn and reduce harmful and unsustainable effects\noriginating from changes in the land-usage.\n2) This work extracts information on the historical location and geographical\ndistribution of wetlands, from hand-drawn maps. This is achieved by using deep\nlearning (DL), and more specifically a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nCNN model is trained on a manually pre-labelled dataset on historical wetlands\nin the area of J\\\"onk\\\"oping county in Sweden. These are all extracted from the\nhistorical map called \"Generalstabskartan\".\n3) The presented CNN performs well and achieves a $F_1$-score of 0.886 when\nevaluated using a 10-fold cross validation over the data. The trained models\nare additionally used to generate a GIS layer of the presumable historical\ngeographical distribution of wetlands for the area that is depicted in the\nsouthern collection in Generalstabskartan, which covers the southern half of\nSweden. This GIS layer is released as an open resource and can be freely used.\n4) To summarise, the presented results show that CNNs can be a useful tool in\nthe extraction and digitalisation of non-textual information in historical\ndocuments, such as historical maps. A modern GIS material that can be used to\nfurther understand the past land-usage change is produced within this research.",

The double DQN has successfully shown both\ntheoretically and empirically the importance of decoupling in terms of action\nevaluation and selection in computation of targets values; although, all the\nbenefits were acquired with only a simple adaption to DQN algorithm, minimal\npossible change as it was mentioned by the authors. Nevertheless, there seems a\nroll-back in the proposed algorithm of Double-DQN since the parameters of\npolicy network are emerged again in the target value function which were\ninitially withdrawn by DQN with the hope of tackling the serious issue of\nmoving targets and the instability caused by it (i.e., by moving targets) in\nthe process of learning. Therefore, in this paper three modifications to the\nDouble-DQN algorithm are proposed with the hope of maintaining the performance\nin the terms of both stability and overestimation. These modifications are\nfocused on the logic of decoupling the best action selection and evaluation in\nthe target value function and the logic of tackling the moving targets issue.\nEach of these modifications have their own pros and cons compared to the\nothers. The mentioned pros and cons mainly refer to the execution time required\nfor the corresponding algorithm and the stability provided by the corresponding\nalgorithm. Also, in terms of overestimation, none of the modifications seem to\nunderperform compared to the original Double-DQN if not outperform it. With the\nintention of evaluating the efficacy of the proposed modifications, multiple\nempirical experiments along with theoretical experiments were conducted.

    "abstract": "The development of cyber-physical systems can significantly benefit from\ndomain-specific modeling and requires adequate (meta)-modeling frameworks. If\nsuch systems are designed for the safety-critical area, the systems must\nundergo qualification processes defined and monitored by a certification\nauthority. To use the resulting artifacts of modeling tools without further\nqualification activities, the modeling tool must be additionally qualified.\nTool qualification has to be conducted by the tool user and can be assisted by\nthe tool developer by providing qualification artifacts. However,\nstate-of-the-art domain-specific modeling frameworks barely support the user in\nthe qualification process, which results in an extensive manual effort. To\nreduce this effort and to avoid modeling constructs that can hardly be\nimplemented in a qualifiable way, we propose the development of an open source\n(meta)-modeling framework that inherently considers qualification issues. Based\non the functionality of existing frameworks, we have identified components that\nnecessarily need to be rethought or changed. This leads to the consideration of\nthe following six cornerstones for our framework: (1) an essential\nmeta-language, (2) a minimal runtime, (3) deterministic transformations, (4) a\nqualification artifact generation, (5) a sophisticated visualization, and (6) a\ndecoupled interaction of framework components. All these cornerstones consider\nthe aspect of a safety-critical (meta)-modeling framework in their own manner.\nThis combination leads to a holistic framework usable in the safety-critical\nsystem development domain.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid increase of available digital data, DNA storage is identified\nas a storage media with high density and capability of long-term preservation,\nespecially for archival storage systems. However, the encoding density (i.e.,\nhow many binary bits can be encoded into one nucleotide) and error handling are\ntwo major factors intertwined in DNA storage. Considering encoding density,\ntheoretically, one nucleotide can encode two binary bits (upper bound).\nHowever, due to biochemical constraints and other necessary information\nassociated with payload, the encoding densities of various DNA storage systems\nare much less than this upper bound. Additionally, all existing studies of DNA\nencoding schemes are based on static analysis and really lack the awareness of\ndynamically changed digital patterns. Therefore, the gap between the static\nencoding and dynamic binary patterns prevents achieving a higher encoding\ndensity for DNA storage systems.\nIn this paper, we propose a new Digital Pattern-Aware DNA storage system,\ncalled DP-DNA, which can efficiently store digital data in DNA storage with\nhigh encoding density. DP-DNA maintains a set of encoding codes and uses a\ndigital pattern-aware code (DPAC) to analyze the patterns of a binary sequence\nfor a DNA strand and selects an appropriate code for encoding the binary\nsequence to achieve a high encoding density. An additional encoding field is\nadded to the DNA encoding format, which can distinguish the encoding scheme\nused for those DNA strands, and thus we can decode DNA data back to its\noriginal digital data. Moreover, to further improve the encoding density, a\nvariable-length scheme is proposed to increase the feasibility of the coding\nscheme with a high encoding density. Finally, the experimental results indicate\nthat the proposed DP-DNA achieves up to 103.5% higher encoding densities than\nprior work.",

Thus, the detailed information\ncontained in T1w imagescould help in the synthesis of diffusion images in\nhigher resolution. However, the non-Euclidean nature of diffusion imaging\nhinders current deep generative models from synthesizing physically plausible\nimages. In this work, we propose the first Riemannian network architecture for\nthe direct generation of diffusion tensors (DT) and diffusion orientation\ndistribution functions (dODFs) from high-resolution T1w images. Our integration\nof the Log-Euclidean Metric into a learning objective guarantees, unlike\nstandard Euclidean networks, the mathematically-valid synthesis of diffusion.\nFurthermore, our approach improves the fractional anisotropy mean squared error\n(FA MSE) between the synthesized diffusion and the ground-truth by more than\n23% and the cosine similarity between principal directions by almost 5% when\ncompared to our baselines. We validate our generated diffusion by comparing the\nresulting tractograms to our expected real data. We observe similar fiber\nbundles with streamlines having less than 3% difference in length, less than 1%\ndifference in volume, and a visually close shape. While our method is able to\ngenerate high-resolution diffusion images from structural inputs in less than\n15 seconds, we acknowledge and discuss the limits of diffusion inference solely\nrelying on T1w images.

    "title": "Reachability Analysis of Neural Feedback Loops",
    "abstract": "Neural Networks (NNs) can provide major empirical performance improvements\nfor closed-loop systems, but they also introduce challenges in formally\nanalyzing those systems' safety properties. In particular, this work focuses on\nestimating the forward reachable set of \\textit{neural feedback loops}\n(closed-loop systems with NN controllers). Recent work provides bounds on these\nreachable sets, but the computationally tractable approaches yield overly\nconservative bounds (thus cannot be used to verify useful properties), and the\nmethods that yield tighter bounds are too intensive for online computation.\nThis work bridges the gap by formulating a convex optimization problem for the\nreachability analysis of closed-loop systems with NN controllers. While the\nsolutions are less tight than previous (semidefinite program-based) methods,\nthey are substantially faster to compute, and some of those computational time\nsavings can be used to refine the bounds through new input set partitioning\ntechniques, which is shown to dramatically reduce the tightness gap. The new\nframework is developed for systems with uncertainty (e.g., measurement and\nprocess noise) and nonlinearities (e.g., polynomial dynamics), and thus is\nshown to be applicable to real-world systems. To inform the design of an\ninitial state set when only the target state set is known/specified, a novel\nalgorithm for backward reachability analysis is also provided, which computes\nthe set of states that are guaranteed to lead to the target set. The numerical\nexperiments show that our approach (based on linear relaxations and\npartitioning) gives a $5\\times$ reduction in conservatism in $150\\times$ less\ncomputation time compared to the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, experiments on\nquadrotor, 270-state, and polynomial systems demonstrate the method's ability\nto handle uncertainty sources, high dimensionality, and nonlinear dynamics,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "Global forest cover is critical to the provision of certain ecosystem\nservices. With the advent of the google earth engine cloud platform, fine\nresolution global land cover mapping task could be accomplished in a matter of\ndays instead of years. The amount of global forest cover (GFC) products has\nbeen steadily increasing in the last decades. However, it's hard for users to\nselect suitable one due to great differences between these products, and the\naccuracy of these GFC products has not been verified on global scale. To\nprovide guidelines for users and producers, it is urgent to produce a\nvalidation sample set at the global level. However, this labeling task is time\nand labor consuming, which has been the main obstacle to the progress of global\nland cover mapping. In this research, a labor-efficient semi-automatic\nframework is introduced to build a biggest ever Forest Sample Set (FSS)\ncontained 395280 scattered samples categorized as forest, shrubland, grassland,\nimpervious surface, etc. On the other hand, to provide guidelines for the\nusers, we comprehensively validated the local and global mapping accuracy of\nall existing 30m GFC products, and analyzed and mapped the agreement of them.\nMoreover, to provide guidelines for the producers, optimal sampling strategy\nwas proposed to improve the global forest classification. Furthermore, a new\nglobal forest cover named GlobeForest2020 has been generated, which proved to\nimprove the previous highest state-of-the-art accuracies (obtained by Gong et\nal., 2017) by 2.77% in uncertain grids and by 1.11% in certain grids.",

    "abstract": "The performance of deep neural networks typically increases with the number\nof training images. However, not all images have the same importance towards\nimproved performance and robustness. In fetal brain MRI, abnormalities\nexacerbate the variability of the developing brain anatomy compared to\nnon-pathological cases. A small number of abnormal cases, as is typically\navailable in clinical datasets used for training, are unlikely to fairly\nrepresent the rich variability of abnormal developing brains. This leads\nmachine learning systems trained by maximizing the average performance to be\nbiased toward non-pathological cases. This problem was recently referred to as\nhidden stratification. To be suited for clinical use, automatic segmentation\nmethods need to reliably achieve high-quality segmentation outcomes also for\npathological cases. In this paper, we show that the state-of-the-art deep\nlearning pipeline nnU-Net has difficulties to generalize to unseen abnormal\ncases. To mitigate this problem, we propose to train a deep neural network to\nminimize a percentile of the distribution of per-volume loss over the dataset.\nWe show that this can be achieved by using Distributionally Robust Optimization\n(DRO). DRO automatically reweights the training samples with lower performance,\nencouraging nnU-Net to perform more consistently on all cases. We validated our\napproach using a dataset of 368 fetal brain T2w MRIs, including 124 MRIs of\nopen spina bifida cases and 51 MRIs of cases with other severe abnormalities of\nbrain development.",

The resulting method is tested through a series\nof numerical examples of increasing complexity, where it is shown that it\noffers increased accuracy compared to other similar approaches.

    "abstract": "Modal logic S5 has attracted significant attention and has led to several\npractical applications, owing to its simplified approach to dealing with\nnesting modal operators. Efficient implementations for evaluating\nsatisfiability of S5 formulas commonly rely on Skolemisation to convert them\ninto propositional logic formulas, essentially by introducing copies of\npropositional atoms for each set of interpretations (possible worlds). This\napproach is simple, but often results into large formulas that are too\ndifficult to process, and therefore more parsimonious constructions are\nrequired. In this work, we propose to use Answer Set Programming for\nimplementing such constructions, and in particular for identifying the\npropositional atoms that are relevant in every world by means of a reachability\nrelation. The proposed encodings are designed to take advantage of other\nproperties such as entailment relations of subformulas rooted by modal\noperators. An empirical assessment of the proposed encodings shows that the\nreachability relation is very effective and leads to comparable performance to\na state-of-the-art S5 solver based on SAT, while entailment relations are\npossibly too expensive to reason about and may result in overhead. This paper\nis under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.",

    "title": "Solving Large-Scale Multi-Objective Optimization via Probabilistic  Prediction Model",
    "abstract": "The main feature of large-scale multi-objective optimization problems (LSMOP)\nis to optimize multiple conflicting objectives while considering thousands of\ndecision variables at the same time. An efficient LSMOP algorithm should have\nthe ability to escape the local optimal solution from the huge search space and\nfind the global optimal. Most of the current researches focus on how to deal\nwith decision variables. However, due to the large number of decision\nvariables, it is easy to lead to high computational cost. Maintaining the\ndiversity of the population is one of the effective ways to improve search\nefficiency. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic prediction model based on\ntrend prediction model and generating-filtering strategy, called LT-PPM, to\ntackle the LSMOP. The proposed method enhances the diversity of the population\nthrough importance sampling. At the same time, due to the adoption of an\nindividual-based evolution mechanism, the computational cost of the proposed\nmethod is independent of the number of decision variables, thus avoiding the\nproblem of exponential growth of the search space. We compared the proposed\nalgorithm with several state-of-the-art algorithms for different benchmark\nfunctions. The experimental results and complexity analysis have demonstrated\nthat the proposed algorithm has significant improvement in terms of its\nperformance and computational efficiency in large-scale multi-objective\noptimization.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present an investigation into the use of neural feature\nextraction in performing scribal hand analysis of the Linear B writing system.\nWhile prior work has demonstrated the usefulness of strategies such as\nphylogenetic systematics in tracing Linear B's history, these approaches have\nrelied on manually extracted features which can be very time consuming to\ndefine by hand. Instead we propose learning features using a fully unsupervised\nneural network that does not require any human annotation. Specifically our\nmodel assigns each glyph written by the same scribal hand a shared vector\nembedding to represent that author's stylistic patterns, and each glyph\nrepresenting the same syllabic sign a shared vector embedding to represent the\nidentifying shape of that character. Thus the properties of each image in our\ndataset are represented as the combination of a scribe embedding and a sign\nembedding. We train this model using both a reconstructive loss governed by a\ndecoder that seeks to reproduce glyphs from their corresponding embeddings, and\na discriminative loss which measures the model's ability to predict whether or\nnot an embedding corresponds to a given image. Among the key contributions of\nthis work we (1) present a new dataset of Linear B glyphs, annotated by scribal\nhand and sign type, (2) propose a neural model for disentangling properties of\nscribal hands from glyph shape, and (3) quantitatively evaluate the learned\nembeddings on findplace prediction and similarity to manually extracted\nfeatures, showing improvements over simpler baseline methods.",

    "abstract": "Non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM) offers byte-addressable persistence\nat speeds comparable to DRAM. However, with caches remaining volatile,\nautomatic cache evictions can reorder updates to memory, potentially leaving\npersistent memory in an inconsistent state upon a system crash. Flush and fence\ninstructions can be used to force ordering among updates, but are expensive.\nThis has motivated significant work studying how to write correct and efficient\npersistent programs for NVRAM.\nIn this paper, we present FliT, a C++ library that facilitates writing\nefficient persistent code. Using the library's default mode makes any\nlinearizable data structure durable with minimal changes to the code. FliT\navoids many redundant flush instructions by using a novel algorithm to track\ndirty cache lines. The FliT library also allows for extra optimizations, but\nachieves good performance even in its default setting.\nTo describe the FliT library's capabilities and guarantees, we define a\npersistent programming interface, called the P-V Interface, which FliT\nimplements. The P-V Interface captures the expected behavior of code in which\nsome instructions' effects are persisted and some are not. We show that the\ninterface captures the desired semantics of many practical algorithms in the\nliterature.\nWe apply the FliT library to four different persistent data structures, and\nshow that across several workloads, persistence implementations, and data\nstructure sizes, the FliT library always improves operation throughput, by at\nleast $2.1\\times$ over a naive implementation in all but one workload.",

    "abstract": "Poisoning attacks are a category of adversarial machine learning threats in\nwhich an adversary attempts to subvert the outcome of the machine learning\nsystems by injecting crafted data into training data set, thus increasing the\nmachine learning model's test error. The adversary can tamper with the data\nfeature space, data labels, or both, each leading to a different attack\nstrategy with different strengths. Various detection approaches have recently\nemerged, each focusing on one attack strategy. The Achilles heel of many of\nthese detection approaches is their dependence on having access to a clean,\nuntampered data set. In this paper, we propose CAE, a Classification\nAuto-Encoder based detector against diverse poisoned data. CAE can detect all\nforms of poisoning attacks using a combination of reconstruction and\nclassification errors without having any prior knowledge of the attack\nstrategy. We show that an enhanced version of CAE (called CAE+) does not have\nto employ a clean data set to train the defense model. Our experimental results\non three real datasets MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR demonstrate that our\nproposed method can maintain its functionality under up to 30% contaminated\ndata and help the defended SVM classifier to regain its best accuracy.",

Various\nstability risks in the original algorithm are analyzed, including potential\nexponential norm growth, cancellations, loss of accuracy with clustered\neigenvalues or intermediate eigenvalues, etc. In the dividing stage, we give a\nnew structured low-rank update strategy with balancing that eliminates the\nexponential norm growth and also minimizes the ranks of low-rank updates. In\nthe conquering stage with low-rank updated eigenvalue solution, the original\nalgorithm directly uses the regular fast multipole method (FMM) to accelerate\nfunction evaluations, which has the risks of cancellation, division by zero,\nand slow convergence. Here, we design a triangular FMM to avoid cancellation.\nFurthermore, when there are clustered intermediate eigenvalues or when updates\nto existing eigenvalues are very small, we design a novel local shifting\nstrategy to integrate FMM accelerations into the solution of shifted secular\nequations so as to achieve both the efficiency and the reliability. We also\nprovide several improvements or clarifications on some structures and\ntechniques that are missing or unclear in the previous work.

This research proposes a framework to repair\nunsafe DNNs in safety-critical systems with reachability analysis. The repair\nprocess is inspired by adversarial training which has demonstrated high\neffectiveness in improving the safety and robustness of DNNs. Different from\ntraditional adversarial training approaches where adversarial examples are\nutilized from random attacks and may not be representative of all unsafe\nbehaviors, our repair process uses reachability analysis to compute the exact\nunsafe regions and identify sufficiently representative examples to enhance the\nefficacy and efficiency of the adversarial training.\nThe performance of our framework is evaluated on two types of benchmarks\nwithout safe models as references. One is a DNN controller for aircraft\ncollision avoidance with access to training data. The other is a rocket lander\nwhere our framework can be seamlessly integrated with the well-known deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (DDPG) reinforcement learning algorithm. The\nexperimental results show that our framework can successfully repair all\ninstances on multiple safety specifications with negligible performance\ndegradation.

However,\nthe amount of information actually needed by a user for downstream tasks --\ne.g., deciding which product to click on in a shopping website -- is likely\nmuch lower. To achieve this lower bitrate, we would ideally only transmit the\nvisual features that drive user behavior, while discarding details irrelevant\nto the user's decisions. We approach this problem by training a compression\nmodel through human-in-the-loop learning as the user performs tasks with the\ncompressed images. The key insight is to train the model to produce a\ncompressed image that induces the user to take the same action that they would\nhave taken had they seen the original image. To approximate the loss function\nfor this model, we train a discriminator that tries to distinguish whether a\nuser's action was taken in response to the compressed image or the original.

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation is a crucial step in many Earth observation tasks.\nLarge quantity of pixel-level annotation is required to train deep networks for\nsemantic segmentation. Earth observation techniques are applied to varieties of\napplications and since classes vary widely depending on the applications,\ntherefore, domain knowledge is often required to label Earth observation\nimages, impeding availability of labeled training data in many Earth\nobservation applications. To tackle these challenges, in this paper we propose\nan unsupervised semantic segmentation method that can be trained using just a\nsingle unlabeled scene. Remote sensing scenes are generally large. The proposed\nmethod exploits this property to sample smaller patches from the larger scene\nand uses deep clustering and contrastive learning to refine the weights of a\nlightweight deep model composed of a series of the convolution layers along\nwith an embedded channel attention. After unsupervised training on the target\nimage/scene, the model automatically segregates the major classes present in\nthe scene and produces the segmentation map. Experimental results on the\nVaihingen dataset demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the task of video panoptic segmentation is studied and two\ndifferent methods to solve the task will be proposed. Video panoptic\nsegmentation (VPS) is a recently introduced computer vision task that requires\nclassifying and tracking every pixel in a given video. The nature of this task\nmakes the cost of annotating datasets for it prohibiting. To understand video\npanoptic segmentation, first, earlier introduced constituent tasks that focus\non semantics and tracking separately will be researched. Thereafter, two\ndata-driven approaches which do not require training on a tailored VPS dataset\nwill be selected to solve it. The first approach will show how a model for\nvideo panoptic segmentation can be built by heuristically fusing the outputs of\na pre-trained semantic segmentation model and a pre-trained multi-object\ntracking model. This can be desired if one wants to easily extend the\ncapabilities of either model. The second approach will counter some of the\nshortcomings of the first approach by building on top of a shared neural\nnetwork backbone with task-specific heads. This network is designed for\npanoptic segmentation and will be extended by a mask propagation module to link\ninstance masks across time, yielding the video panoptic segmentation format.",

Specifically, identifying known classes and\nrejecting unknown classes correspond to reducing the empirical risk and the\nopen space risk, respectively. First, the motorial prototype framework (MPF) is\nproposed, which classifies known classes according to the prototype\nclassification idea. Moreover, a motorial margin constraint term is added into\nthe loss function of the MPF, which can further improve the clustering\ncompactness of known classes in the feature space to reduce both risks. Second,\nthis paper proposes the adversarial motorial prototype framework (AMPF) based\non the MPF.

Unfortunately, the ambiguity or\nuncertainty cannot be reflected in hard emotion labels. Emotion predictions\nwith uncertainty can be useful for risk controlling, but they are relatively\nscarce in current deep models for emotion recognition. To address this issue,\nwe propose to apply the multi-generational self-distillation algorithm to\nemotion recognition task towards better uncertainty estimation performance.\nWe firstly use deep ensembles to capture uncertainty, as an approximation to\nBayesian methods. Secondly, the deep ensemble provides soft labels to its\nstudent models, while the student models can learn from the uncertainty\nembedded in those soft labels. Thirdly, we iteratively train deep ensembles to\nfurther improve the performance of emotion recognition and uncertainty\nestimation. In the end, our algorithm results in a single student model that\ncan estimate in-domain uncertainty and a student ensemble that can detect\nout-of-domain samples.

To\nachieve this goal, we propose a transformer-based network, called SignLookup.\nWe employ 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract spatio-temporal\nrepresentations from video clips. To solve the temporal scale discrepancies\nbetween the query and the target videos, we construct multiple queries from a\nsingle video clip using different frame-level strides. Self-attention is\napplied across these query clips to simulate a continuous scale space. We also\nutilize another self-attention module on the target video to learn the\ncontextual within the sequence. Finally a mutual-attention is used to match the\ntemporal scales to localize the query within the target sequence. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can not only reliably\nidentify isolated signs in continuous videos, regardless of the signers'\nappearance, but can also generalize to different sign languages.

The latter often\nconsists on short and noisy trajectories, which are hard to characterize with\nusual statistical approaches. In recent years, we have witnessed an impressive\neffort to bridge theory and experiments by means of supervised machine learning\ntechniques, with astonishing results. In this work, we explore the use of\nunsupervised methods in anomalous diffusion data. We show that the main\ndiffusion characteristics can be learnt without the need of any labelling of\nthe data. We use such method to discriminate between anomalous diffusion models\nand extract their physical parameters. Moreover, we explore the feasibility of\nfinding novel types of diffusion, in this case represented by compositions of\nexisting diffusion models. At last, we showcase the use of the method in\nexperimental data and demonstrate its advantages for cases where supervised\nlearning is not applicable.",

    "abstract": "An efficient method for obtaining low-density hyperplane separators in the\nunsupervised context is proposed. Low density separators can be used to obtain\na partition of a set of data based on their allocations to the different sides\nof the separators. The proposed method is based on applying stochastic gradient\ndescent to the integrated density on the hyperplane with respect to a\nconvolution of the underlying distribution and a smoothing kernel. In the case\nwhere the bandwidth of the smoothing kernel is decreased towards zero, the bias\nof these updates with respect to the true underlying density tends to zero, and\nconvergence to a minimiser of the density on the hyperplane can be obtained. A\npost-processing of the partition induced by a collection of low-density\nhyperplanes yields an efficient and accurate clustering method which is capable\nof automatically selecting an appropriate number of clusters. Experiments with\nthe proposed approach show that it is highly competitive in terms of both speed\nand accuracy when compared with relevant benchmarks.

The current definitions of head impact subtypes are based\non impact sources (e.g., football, traffic accident), which may not reflect the\nintrinsic kinematic similarities of impacts across the impact sources. To\ninvestigate the potential new definitions of impact subtypes based on\nkinematics, 3,161 head impacts from various sources including simulation,\ncollege football, mixed martial arts, and car racing were collected. We applied\nthe K-means clustering to cluster the impacts on 16 standardized temporal\nfeatures from head rotation kinematics.

To investigate the effect of kinematic features,\nwe presented the top three critical features (maximum resultant angular\nacceleration, maximum angular acceleration along the z-axis, maximum linear\nacceleration along the y-axis) based on regression accuracy and used logistic\nregression to find the critical points for each feature that partitioned the\nsubtypes.

Musical rhythm comprises complex hierarchical relationships\nacross time, rendering its analysis intrinsically challenging and at times\nsubjective.

    "abstract": "Recently, GAN vocoders have seen rapid progress in speech synthesis, starting\nto outperform autoregressive models in perceptual quality with much higher\ngeneration speed. However, autoregressive vocoders are still the common choice\nfor neural generation of speech signals coded at very low bit rates. In this\npaper, we present a GAN vocoder which is able to generate wideband speech\nwaveforms from parameters coded at 1.6 kbit/s. The proposed model is a modified\nversion of the StyleMelGAN vocoder that can run in frame-by-frame manner,\nmaking it suitable for streaming applications. The experimental results show\nthat the proposed model significantly outperforms prior autoregressive vocoders\nlike LPCNet for very low bit rate speech coding, with computational complexity\nof about 5 GMACs, providing a new state of the art in this domain. Moreover,\nthis streamwise adversarial vocoder delivers quality competitive to advanced\nspeech codecs such as EVS at 5.9 kbit/s on clean speech, which motivates\nfurther usage of feed-forward fully-convolutional models for low bit rate\nspeech coding.",

    "abstract": "The stochastic nature of photovoltaic (PV) power has led both academia and\nindustry to a large amount of research work aiming at the development of\naccurate PV power forecasting models. However, most of those models are based\non machine learning algorithms and are considered as black boxes which do not\nprovide any insight or explanation about their predictions. Therefore, their\ndirect implementation in environments, where transparency is required, and the\ntrust associated with their predictions may be questioned. To this end, we\npropose a two stage probabilistic forecasting framework able to generate highly\naccurate, reliable, and sharp forecasts yet offering full transparency on both\nthe point forecasts and the prediction intervals (PIs). In the first stage, we\nexploit natural gradient boosting (NGBoost) for yielding probabilistic\nforecasts while in the second stage, we calculate the Shapley additive\nexplanation (SHAP) values in order to fully understand why a prediction was\nmade. To highlight the performance and the applicability of the proposed\nframework, real data from two PV parks located in Southern Germany are\nemployed. Initially, the natural gradient boosting is thoroughly compared with\ntwo state-of-the-art algorithms, namely Gaussian process and lower upper bound\nestimation, in a wide range of forecasting metrics. Secondly, a detailed\nanalysis of the model's complex nonlinear relationships and interaction effects\nbetween the various features is presented. The latter allows us to interpret\nthe model, identify some learned physical properties, explain individual\npredictions, reduce the computational requirements for the training without\njeopardizing the model accuracy, detect possible bugs, and gain trust in the\nmodel. Finally, we conclude that the model was able to develop nonlinear\nrelationships following human logic and intuition based on learned physical\nproperties.",

    "abstract": "In the classic apportionment problem the goal is to decide how many seats of\na parliament should be allocated to each party as a result of an election. The\ndivisor methods provide a way of solving this problem by defining a notion of\nproportionality guided by some rounding rule. Motivated by recent challenges in\nthe context of electoral apportionment, we consider the question of how to\nallocate the seats of a parliament under parity constraints between candidate\ntypes (e.g. equal number of men and women elected) while at the same time\nsatisfying party proportionality.\nWe consider two different approaches for this problem. The first mechanism,\nthat follows a greedy approach, corresponds to a recent mechanism used in the\nChilean Constitutional Convention 2021 election. We analyze this mechanism from\na theoretical point of view. The second mechanism follows the idea of\nbiproportionality introduced by Balinski and Demange [Math. Program. 1989,\nMath. Oper. Res. 1989]. In contrast with the classic biproportional method by\nBalinski and Demange, this mechanism is ruled by two levels of proportionality:\nProportionality is satisfied at the level of parties by means of a divisor\nmethod, and then biproportionality is used to decide the number of candidates\nallocated to each type and party. We provide a theoretical analysis of this\nmechanism, making progress on the theoretical understanding of methods with two\nlevels of proportionality. A typical benchmark used in the context of\ntwo-dimensional apportionment is the fair share (a.k.a matrix scaling), which\ncorresponds to an ideal fractional biproportional solution. We provide lower\nbounds on the distance between these two types of solutions, and we explore\ntheir consequences in the context of two-dimensional apportionment.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Functional coupling between the motor cortex and muscle activity\nis commonly detected and quantified by cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) or\nGranger causality (GC) analysis, which are applicable only to linear couplings\nand are not sufficiently sensitive: some healthy subjects show no significant\nCMC and GC, and yet have good motor skills. The objective of this work is to\ndevelop measures of functional cortico-muscular coupling that have improved\nsensitivity and are capable of detecting both linear and non-linear\ninteractions. Methods: A multiscale wavelet transfer entropy (TE) methodology\nis proposed. The methodology relies on a dyadic stationary wavelet transform to\ndecompose electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals into\nfunctional bands of neural oscillations. Then, it applies TE analysis based on\na range of embedding delay vectors to detect and quantify intra- and\ncross-frequency band cortico-muscular coupling at different time scales.\nResults: Our experiments with neurophysiological signals substantiate the\npotential of the developed methodologies for detecting and quantifying\ninformation flow between EEG and EMG signals for subjects with and without\nsignificant CMC or GC, including non-linear cross-frequency interactions, and\ninteractions across different temporal scales. The obtained results are in\nagreement with the underlying sensorimotor neurophysiology. Conclusion: These\nfindings suggest that the concept of multiscale wavelet TE provides a\ncomprehensive framework for analysing cortex-muscle interactions. Significance:\nThe proposed methodologies will enable developing novel insights into movement\ncontrol and neurophysiological processes more generally.",

    "abstract": "Protein secondary structure prediction (PSSP) is essential for protein\nfunction analysis. However, for low homologous proteins, the PSSP suffers from\ninsufficient input features. In this paper, we explicitly import external\nself-supervised knowledge for low homologous PSSP under the guidance of\nresidue-wise profile fusion. In practice, we firstly demonstrate the\nsuperiority of profile over Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) for low\nhomologous PSSP. Based on this observation, we introduce the novel\nself-supervised BERT features as the pseudo profile, which implicitly involves\nthe residue distribution in all native discovered sequences as the\ncomplementary features. Further-more, a novel residue-wise attention is\nspecially designed to adaptively fuse different features (i.e.,original\nlow-quality profile, BERT based pseudo profile), which not only takes full\nadvantage of each feature but also avoids noise disturbance. Be-sides, the\nfeature consistency loss is proposed to accelerate the model learning from\nmultiple semantic levels.
