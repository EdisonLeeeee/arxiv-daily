    "abstract": "The ability to train complex and highly effective models often requires an\nabundance of training data, which can easily become a bottleneck in cost, time,\nand computational resources. Batch active learning, which adaptively issues\nbatched queries to a labeling oracle, is a common approach for addressing this\nproblem. The practical benefits of batch sampling come with the downside of\nless adaptivity and the risk of sampling redundant examples within a batch -- a\nrisk that grows with the batch size. In this work, we analyze an efficient\nactive learning algorithm, which focuses on the large batch setting. In\nparticular, we show that our sampling method, which combines notions of\nuncertainty and diversity, easily scales to batch sizes (100K-1M) several\norders of magnitude larger than used in previous studies and provides\nsignificant improvements in model training efficiency compared to recent\nbaselines. Finally, we provide an initial theoretical analysis, proving label\ncomplexity guarantees for a related sampling method, which we show is\napproximately equivalent to our sampling method in specific settings.",

    "abstract": "A communication setup is considered where a transmitter wishes to convey a\nmessage to a receiver and simultaneously estimate the state of that receiver\nthrough a common waveform. The state is estimated at the transmitter by means\nof generalized feedback, i.e., a strictly causal channel output, and the known\nwaveform. The scenario at hand is motivated by joint radar and communication,\nwhich aims to co-design radar sensing and communication over shared spectrum\nand hardware. For the case of memoryless single receiver channels with i.i.d.\ntime-varying state sequences, we fully characterize the capacity-distortion\ntradeoff, defined as the largest achievable rate below which a message can be\nconveyed reliably while satisfying some distortion constraints on state\nsensing. We propose a numerical method to compute the optimal input that\nachieves the capacity-distortion tradeoff. Then, we address memoryless\nstate-dependent broadcast channels (BCs). For physically degraded BCs with\ni.i.d. time-varying state sequences, we characterize the capacity-distortion\ntradeoff region as a rather straightforward extension of single receiver\nchannels. For general BCs, we provide inner and outer bounds on the\ncapacity-distortion region, as well as a sufficient condition when this\ncapacity-distortion region is equal to the product of the capacity region and\nthe set of achievable distortions. A number of illustrative examples\ndemonstrates that the optimal co-design schemes outperform conventional schemes\nthat split the resources between sensing and communication.",

Most existing\nmethods perform domain alignment in a shared space and assume that the mapping\nfrom the aligned space to the output is transferable. However, the novel\ncontent induced by viewpoint changes may nullify such a space for effective\nalignments, thus resulting in negative adaptation. Our method works without\naligning any statistics of the images between the two domains. Instead, it\nutilizes a view transformation network trained only on color images to\nhallucinate the semantic images for the target. Despite the lack of\nsupervision, the view transformation network can still generalize to semantic\nimages thanks to the inductive bias introduced by the attention mechanism.\nFurthermore, to resolve ambiguities in converting the semantic images to\nsemantic labels, we treat the view transformation network as a functional\nrepresentation of an unknown mapping implied by the color images and propose\nfunctional label hallucination to generate pseudo-labels in the target domain.\nOur method surpasses baselines built on state-of-the-art correspondence\nestimation and view synthesis methods.

    "abstract": "Deep Learning and factorization-based collaborative filtering recommendation\nmodels have undoubtedly dominated the scene of recommender systems in recent\nyears. However, despite their outstanding performance, these methods require a\ntraining time proportional to the size of the embeddings and it further\nincreases when also side information is considered for the computation of the\nrecommendation list. In fact, in these cases we have that with a large number\nof high-quality features, the resulting models are more complex and difficult\nto train. This paper addresses this problem by presenting KGFlex: a sparse\nfactorization approach that grants an even greater degree of expressiveness. To\nachieve this result, KGFlex analyzes the historical data to understand the\ndimensions the user decisions depend on (e.g., movie direction, musical genre,\nnationality of book writer). KGFlex represents each item feature as an\nembedding and it models user-item interactions as a factorized entropy-driven\ncombination of the item attributes relevant to the user. KGFlex facilitates the\ntraining process by letting users update only those relevant features on which\nthey base their decisions. In other words, the user-item prediction is mediated\nby the user's personal view that considers only relevant features. An extensive\nexperimental evaluation shows the approach's effectiveness, considering the\nrecommendation results' accuracy, diversity, and induced bias.

    "abstract": "Multivariate time-series (MVTS) data are frequently observed in critical care\nsettings and are typically characterized by excessive missingness and irregular\ntime intervals. Existing approaches for learning representations in this domain\nhandle such issues by either aggregation or imputation of values, which in-turn\nsuppresses the fine-grained information and adds undesirable noise/overhead\ninto the machine learning model. To tackle this challenge, we propose STraTS\n(Self-supervised Transformer for TimeSeries) model which bypasses these\npitfalls by treating time-series as a set of observation triplets instead of\nusing the traditional dense matrix representation. It employs a novel\nContinuous Value Embedding (CVE) technique to encode continuous time and\nvariable values without the need for discretization. It is composed of a\nTransformer component with Multi-head attention layers which enables it to\nlearn contextual triplet embeddings while avoiding problems of recurrence and\nvanishing gradients that occur in recurrent architectures. Many healthcare\ndatasets also suffer from the limited availability of labeled data. Our model\nutilizes self-supervision by leveraging unlabeled data to learn better\nrepresentations by performing time-series forecasting as a self-supervision\ntask. Experiments on real-world multivariate clinical time-series benchmark\ndatasets show that STraTS shows better prediction performance than\nstate-of-the-art methods for mortality prediction, especially when labeled data\nis limited.

Therefore, one can benefit from the growth of the\ncryptocurrency markets, with minimal exposure to their volatility risks. We aim\nto explain the rationale behind these savings products in simple terms. The key\nto this puzzle is that asset deposits in cryptocurrency ecosystems are of\nintrinsic economic value, as they facilitate network consensus mechanisms and\nautomated marketplaces (e.g. for lending). These functions create wealth for\nthe participants, and they provide unique advantages unavailable in traditional\nfinancial systems.

The reconstruction\nproblem then consists of inferring the vertex positions, up to symmetry, given\nonly the adjacency matrix of the resulting graph. We give an algorithm that, if\n$r=n^\\alpha$ for $\\alpha > 0$, with high probability reconstructs the vertex\npositions with a maximum error of $O(n^\\beta)$ where $\\beta=1/2-(4/3)\\alpha$,\nuntil $\\alpha \\ge 3/8$ where $\\beta=0$ and the error becomes $O(\\sqrt{\\log\nn})$. This improves over earlier results, which were unable to reconstruct with\nerror less than $r$. Our method estimates Euclidean distances using a hybrid of\ngraph distances and short-range estimates based on the number of common\nneighbors. We sketch proofs that our results also apply on the surface of a\nsphere, and (with somewhat different exponents) in any fixed dimension.",

Security is of paramount\nimportance in such environments. This paper addresses aspects of authorized\naccess and intruder detection for smart environments. Proposed is PiBase, an\nInternet of Things (IoT)-based app that aids in detecting intruders and\nproviding security. The hardware for the application consists of a Raspberry\nPi, a PIR motion sensor to detect motion from infrared radiation in the\nenvironment, an Android mobile phone and a camera. The software for the\napplication is written in Java, Python and NodeJS. The PIR sensor and Pi camera\nmodule connected to the Raspberry Pi aid in detecting human intrusion. Machine\nlearning algorithms, namely Haar-feature based cascade classifiers and Linear\nBinary Pattern Histograms (LBPH), are used for face detection and face\nrecognition, respectively. The app lets the user create a list of non-intruders\nand anyone that is not on the list is identified as an intruder. The app alerts\nthe user only in the event of an intrusion by using the Google Firebase Cloud\nMessaging service to trigger a notification to the app. The user may choose to\nadd the detected intruder to the list of non-intruders through the app to avoid\nfurther detections as intruder. Face detection by the Haar Cascade algorithm\nyields a recall of 94.6%. Thus, the system is both highly effective and\nrelatively low cost.",

How simulation can best contribute to\nscientific insight about RS alongside qualitative and quantitative empirical\napproaches is an open question. Philosophers and researchers have long debated\nthe epistemological nature of simulation compared to wholly theoretical or\nempirical methods. Simulation is often implicitly or explicitly conceptualized\nas occupying a middle ground between empirical and theoretical approaches,\nallowing researchers to realize the benefits of both. However, what is often\nignored in such arguments is that without firm grounding in any single\nmethodological tradition, simulation studies have no agreed upon scientific\nnorms or standards, resulting in a patchwork of theoretical motivations,\napproaches, and implementations that are difficult to reconcile. In this\nposition paper, we argue that simulation studies of RS are conceptually similar\nto empirical experimental approaches and therefore can be evaluated using the\nstandards of empirical research methods. Using this empirical lens, we argue\nthat the combination of high heterogeneity in approaches and low transparency\nin methods in simulation studies of RS has limited their interpretability,\ngeneralizability, and replicability.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks set the state-of-the-art across many tasks in computer\nvision, but their generalization ability to image distortions is surprisingly\nfragile. In contrast, the mammalian visual system is robust to a wide range of\nperturbations. Recent work suggests that this generalization ability can be\nexplained by useful inductive biases encoded in the representations of visual\nstimuli throughout the visual cortex. Here, we successfully leveraged these\ninductive biases with a multi-task learning approach: we jointly trained a deep\nnetwork to perform image classification and to predict neural activity in\nmacaque primary visual cortex (V1). We measured the out-of-distribution\ngeneralization abilities of our network by testing its robustness to image\ndistortions. We found that co-training on monkey V1 data leads to increased\nrobustness despite the absence of those distortions during training.\nAdditionally, we showed that our network's robustness is very close to that of\nan Oracle network where parts of the architecture are directly trained on noisy\nimages. Our results also demonstrated that the network's representations become\nmore brain-like as their robustness improves. Using a novel constrained\nreconstruction analysis, we investigated what makes our brain-regularized\nnetwork more robust. We found that our co-trained network is more sensitive to\ncontent than noise when compared to a Baseline network that we trained for\nimage classification alone. Using DeepGaze-predicted saliency maps for ImageNet\nimages, we found that our monkey co-trained network tends to be more sensitive\nto salient regions in a scene, reminiscent of existing theories on the role of\nV1 in the detection of object borders and bottom-up saliency. Overall, our work\nexpands the promising research avenue of transferring inductive biases from the\nbrain, and provides a novel analysis of the effects of our transfer.",

    "abstract": "Virtual and robotic agents capable of perceiving human empathy have the\npotential to participate in engaging and meaningful human-machine interactions\nthat support human well-being. Prior research in computational empathy has\nfocused on designing empathic agents that use verbal and nonverbal behaviors to\nsimulate empathy and attempt to elicit empathic responses from humans. The\nchallenge of developing agents with the ability to automatically perceive\nelicited empathy in humans remains largely unexplored. Our paper presents the\nfirst approach to modeling user empathy elicited during interactions with a\nrobotic agent. We collected a new dataset from the novel interaction context of\nparticipants listening to a robot storyteller (46 participants, 6.9 hours of\nvideo). After each storytelling interaction, participants answered a\nquestionnaire that assessed their level of elicited empathy during the\ninteraction with the robot. We conducted experiments with 8 classical machine\nlearning models and 2 deep learning models (long short-term memory networks and\ntemporal convolutional networks) to detect empathy by leveraging patterns in\nparticipants' visual behaviors while they were listening to the robot\nstoryteller. Our highest-performing approach, based on XGBoost, achieved an\naccuracy of 69% and AUC of 72% when detecting empathy in videos. We contribute\ninsights regarding modeling approaches and visual features for automated\nempathy detection. Our research informs and motivates future development of\nempathy perception models that can be leveraged by virtual and robotic agents\nduring human-machine interactions.",

To create a better\nunderstanding of human behavior and brain functionality, we should introduce\nother measures and analyze behavior from various aspects. However, it is\ntechnically complex and costly to design and implement the experiments that\nrecord multiple measures. To address this issue, a platform that allows\nsynchronizing multiple measures from human behavior is needed. Method: This\npaper introduces an opensource platform named OpenSync, which can be used to\nsynchronize multiple measures in neuroscience experiments. This platform helps\nto automatically integrate, synchronize and record physiological measures\n(e.g., electroencephalogram (EEG), galvanic skin response (GSR), eye-tracking,\nbody motion, etc.), user input response (e.g., from mouse, keyboard, joystick,\netc.), and task-related information (stimulus markers). In this paper, we\nexplain the structure and details of OpenSync, provide two case studies in\nPsychoPy and Unity. Comparison with existing tools: Unlike proprietary systems\n(e.g., iMotions), OpenSync is free and it can be used inside any opensource\nexperiment design software (e.g., PsychoPy, OpenSesame, Unity, etc.,\nhttps://pypi.org/project/OpenSync/ and\nhttps://github.com/moeinrazavi/OpenSync_Unity).

    "abstract": "With the global refugee crisis at a historic high, there is a growing need to\nassess the impact of refugee settlements on their hosting countries and\nsurrounding environments. Because fires are an important land management\npractice in smallholder agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa, burned area (BA)\nmappings can help provide information about the impacts of land management\npractices on local environments. However, a lack of BA ground-truth data in\nmuch of sub-Saharan Africa limits the use of highly scalable deep learning (DL)\ntechniques for such BA mappings. In this work, we propose a scalable transfer\nlearning approach to study BA dynamics in areas with little to no ground-truth\ndata such as the West Nile region in Northern Uganda. We train a deep learning\nmodel on BA ground-truth data in Portugal and propose the application of that\nmodel on refugee-hosting districts in West Nile between 2015 and 2020. By\ncomparing the district-level BA dynamic with the wider West Nile region, we aim\nto add understanding of the land management impacts of refugee settlements on\ntheir surrounding environments.",

    "abstract": "Merge trees, a type of topological descriptor, serve to identify and\nsummarize the topological characteristics associated with scalar fields. They\npresent a great potential for the analysis and visualization of time-varying\ndata. First, they give compressed and topology-preserving representations of\ndata instances. Second, their comparisons provide a basis for studying the\nrelations among data instances, such as their distributions, clusters,\noutliers, and periodicities. A number of comparative measures have been\ndeveloped for merge trees. However, these measures are often computationally\nexpensive since they implicitly consider all possible correspondences between\ncritical points of the merge trees. In this paper, we perform geometry-aware\ncomparisons of merge trees using labeled interleaving distances. The main idea\nis to decouple the computation of a comparative measure into two steps: a\nlabeling step that generates a correspondence between the critical points of\ntwo merge trees, and a comparison step that computes distances between a pair\nof labeled merge trees by encoding them as matrices. We show that our approach\nis general, computationally efficient, and practically useful. Our general\nframework makes it possible to integrate geometric information of the data\ndomain in the labeling process. At the same time, it reduces the computational\ncomplexity since not all possible correspondences have to be considered. We\ndemonstrate via experiments that such geometry-aware merge tree comparisons\nhelp to detect transitions, clusters, and periodicities of time-varying\ndatasets, as well as to diagnose and highlight the topological changes between\nadjacent data instances.",

Finally,\nall the sub-series generated by the EWT, including raw data, are fed into the\nedRVFL for forecasting purposes.

    "abstract": "As an emerging data modal with precise distance sensing, LiDAR point clouds\nhave been placed great expectations on 3D scene understanding. However, point\nclouds are always sparsely distributed in the 3D space, and with unstructured\nstorage, which makes it difficult to represent them for effective 3D object\ndetection. To this end, in this work, we regard point clouds as hollow-3D data\nand propose a new architecture, namely Hallucinated Hollow-3D R-CNN\n($\\text{H}^2$3D R-CNN), to address the problem of 3D object detection. In our\napproach, we first extract the multi-view features by sequentially projecting\nthe point clouds into the perspective view and the bird-eye view. Then, we\nhallucinate the 3D representation by a novel bilaterally guided multi-view\nfusion block. Finally, the 3D objects are detected via a box refinement module\nwith a novel Hierarchical Voxel RoI Pooling operation. The proposed\n$\\text{H}^2$3D R-CNN provides a new angle to take full advantage of\ncomplementary information in the perspective view and the bird-eye view with an\nefficient framework. We evaluate our approach on the public KITTI Dataset and\nWaymo Open Dataset.

To alleviate this problem, a large amount\nof efforts has been dedicated to exploiting various methods which leverage\nnumerous unlabeled data. However, many aspects with regard to some unique\nproperties of AUs, such as the regional and relational characteristics, are not\nsufficiently explored in previous works. Motivated by this, we take the AU\nproperties into consideration and propose two auxiliary AU related tasks to\nbridge the gap between limited annotations and the model performance in a\nself-supervised manner via the unlabeled data. Specifically, to enhance the\ndiscrimination of regional features with AU relation embedding, we design a\ntask of RoI inpainting to recover the randomly cropped AU patches. Meanwhile, a\nsingle image based optical flow estimation task is proposed to leverage the\ndynamic change of facial muscles and encode the motion information into the\nglobal feature representation. Based on these two self-supervised auxiliary\ntasks, local features, mutual relation and motion cues of AUs are better\ncaptured in the backbone network with the proposed regional and temporal based\nauxiliary task learning (RTATL) framework.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for the network slicing\nproblem which attempts to map multiple customized virtual network requests\n(also called services) to a common shared network infrastructure and allocate\nnetwork resources to meet diverse service requirements. The problem has been\nformulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation in the\nliterature. By exploiting the special structure of the network slicing problem,\nwe first propose a novel linear programming (LP) relaxation of the MILP\nformulation. We show that compared with a natural LP relaxation of the MILP\nformulation, the novel LP relaxation is much more compact in terms of smaller\nnumbers of variables and constraints, and much stronger in terms of providing a\nbetter LP bound, which makes it particularly suitable to be embedded in an LP\nbased algorithm. Then we design an efficient two-stage LP\nrounding-and-refinement algorithm based on this novel LP relaxation. In the\nfirst stage, the proposed algorithm uses an iterative LP rounding procedure to\nplace the virtual network functions of all services into cloud nodes while\ntaking traffic routing of all services into consideration; in the second stage,\nthe proposed algorithm uses an iterative LP refinement procedure to obtain a\nsolution for traffic routing of all services with their end-to-end delay\nconstraints being satisfied. Compared with the existing algorithms which either\nhave an exponential complexity or return a low-quality solution, our proposed\nalgorithm achieves a better trade-off between the solution quality and the\ncomputational complexity. In particular, the worst-case complexity of our\nproposed algorithm is polynomial, which makes it suitable for solving\nlarge-scale problems.

The crash risk under fog conditions\nwas estimated using a crash risk prediction model based on Bayesian logistic\nregression. The traffic flow with VSL control was simulated by a modified cell\ntransmission model (MCTM).

In the projection part, input vectors are projected into a\nsequence of subspaces via multi channel sparse projection network. In the\nharmonizing part, a modified Transformer network is employed to harmonize\nfeatures in subspaces and combine them to get a new feature. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct experiments on two\nmillion-scale databases, GIST1M and Deep1M. Experimental results show that the\nproposed model can improve the speed of building indexing graph to 2-3 times\nits original speed without sacrificing accuracy significantly. The query\nlatency is reduced by a factor of 1.3 to 2.0. In addition, the proposed model\ncan also be combined with other popular quantization methods.",

Sometimes this is acceptable, but often it is not.\nWe propose a novel architecture, Regression Networks, which combines the\npower of neural networks with the understandability of regression analysis.\nWhile some methods for combining these exist in the literature, our\narchitecture generalizes these approaches by taking interactions into account,\noffering the power of a dense neural network without forsaking\ninterpretability. We demonstrate that the models exceed the state-of-the-art\nperformance of interpretable models on several benchmark datasets, matching the\npower of a dense neural network.

We design a set of annotated and captioned\nvisualizations to represent the answers in a form that supports interpretation\nand narration.

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation requires per-pixel prediction for a given image.\nTypically, the output resolution of a segmentation network is severely reduced\ndue to the downsampling operations in the CNN backbone. Most previous methods\nemploy upsampling decoders to recover the spatial resolution. Various decoders\nwere designed in the literature. Here, we propose a novel decoder, termed\ndynamic neural representational decoder (NRD), which is simple yet\nsignificantly more efficient. As each location on the encoder's output\ncorresponds to a local patch of the semantic labels, in this work, we represent\nthese local patches of labels with compact neural networks. This neural\nrepresentation enables our decoder to leverage the smoothness prior in the\nsemantic label space, and thus makes our decoder more efficient. Furthermore,\nthese neural representations are dynamically generated and conditioned on the\noutputs of the encoder networks. The desired semantic labels can be efficiently\ndecoded from the neural representations, resulting in high-resolution semantic\nsegmentation predictions. We empirically show that our proposed decoder can\noutperform the decoder in DeeplabV3+ with only 30% computational complexity,\nand achieve competitive performance with the methods using dilated encoders\nwith only 15% computation.

    "abstract": "The existence of redundancy in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) enables\nus to remove some filters/channels with acceptable performance drops. However,\nthe training objective of CNNs usually tends to minimize an accuracy-related\nloss function without any attention paid to the redundancy, making the\nredundancy distribute randomly on all the filters, such that removing any of\nthem may trigger information loss and accuracy drop, necessitating a following\nfinetuning step for recovery. In this paper, we propose to manipulate the\nredundancy during training to facilitate network pruning. To this end, we\npropose a novel Centripetal SGD (C-SGD) to make some filters identical,\nresulting in ideal redundancy patterns, as such filters become purely redundant\ndue to their duplicates; hence removing them does not harm the network. As\nshown on CIFAR and ImageNet, C-SGD delivers better performance because the\nredundancy is better organized, compared to the existing methods. The\nefficiency also characterizes C-SGD because it is as fast as regular SGD,\nrequires no finetuning, and can be conducted simultaneously on all the layers\neven in very deep CNNs. Besides, C-SGD can improve the accuracy of CNNs by\nfirst training a model with the same architecture but wider layers then\nsqueezing it into the original width.",

    "abstract": "Learning generalizable manipulation skills is central for robots to achieve\ntask automation in environments with endless scene and object variations.\nHowever, existing robot learning environments are limited in both scale and\ndiversity of 3D assets (especially of articulated objects), making it difficult\nto train and evaluate the generalization ability of agents over novel objects.\nIn this work, we focus on object-level generalization and propose SAPIEN\nManipulation Skill Benchmark (abbreviated as ManiSkill), a large-scale\nlearning-from-demonstrations benchmark for articulated object manipulation with\nvisual input (point cloud and image). ManiSkill supports object-level\nvariations by utilizing a rich and diverse set of articulated objects, and each\ntask is carefully designed for learning manipulations on a single category of\nobjects. We equip ManiSkill with high-quality demonstrations to facilitate\nlearning-from-demonstrations approaches and perform evaluations on common\nbaseline algorithms. We believe ManiSkill can encourage the robot learning\ncommunity to explore more on learning generalizable object manipulation skills.",

    "title": "Refining Labelled Systems for Modal and Constructive Logics with  Applications",
    "abstract": "This thesis introduces the \"method of structural refinement\", which serves as\na means of transforming the relational semantics of a modal and/or constructive\nlogic into an 'economical' proof system by connecting two proof-theoretic\nparadigms: labelled and nested sequent calculi. The formalism of labelled\nsequents has been successful in that cut-free calculi in possession of\ndesirable proof-theoretic properties can be automatically generated for large\nclasses of logics. Despite these qualities, labelled systems make use of a\ncomplicated syntax that explicitly incorporates the semantics of the associated\nlogic, and such systems typically violate the subformula property to a high\ndegree. By contrast, nested sequent calculi employ a simpler syntax and adhere\nto a strict reading of the subformula property, making such systems useful in\nthe design of automated reasoning algorithms. However, the downside of the\nnested sequent paradigm is that a general theory concerning the automated\nconstruction of such calculi (as in the labelled setting) is essentially\nabsent, meaning that the construction of nested systems and the confirmation of\ntheir properties is usually done on a case-by-case basis. The refinement method\nconnects both paradigms in a fruitful way, by transforming labelled systems\ninto nested (or, refined labelled) systems with the properties of the former\npreserved throughout the transformation process.\nTo demonstrate the method of refinement and some of its applications, we\nconsider grammar logics, first-order intuitionistic logics, and deontic STIT\nlogics. The introduced refined labelled calculi will be used to provide the\nfirst proof-search algorithms for deontic STIT logics. Furthermore, we employ\nour refined labelled calculi for grammar logics to show that every logic in the\nclass possesses the effective Lyndon interpolation property.",

    "title": "Feasibility of GNSS-free Localization: A TDoA-based Approach Using  LoRaWAN",
    "abstract": "LoRaWAN has garnered tremendous attention owing to the low power consumption\nof end nodes, long range, high resistance to multipath, low cost, and use of\nlicense-free sub-GHz bands. Consequently, LoRaWAN is gradually replacing Wi-Fi\nand Bluetooth in sundry IoT applications including utility metering, smart\ncities, and localization. Localization, in particular, has already witnessed a\nsurge of alternatives to Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), based on\nWi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ultra Wide Band, 5G, etc. in indoor and low power domains due\nto the poor indoor coverage and high power consumption of GNSS. With the need\nfor localization only shooting up with dense IoT deployments, LoRaWAN is seen\nas a promising solution in this context. Indeed, many attempts employing\nvarious techniques such as Time of Arrival (ToA), Time Difference of Arrival\n(TDoA), and Received Signal Strength Index (RSSI) have been made to achieve\nlocalization using LoRaWAN. However, a significant drawback in this scenario is\nthe lack of extensive data on path loss and signal propagation modeling,\nparticularly in Indian cityscapes. Another demerit is the use of GNSS at some\nstage primarily for time synchronization of gateways. In this work, we attempt\nto nullify these two disadvantages of LoRaWAN based localization. The first\npart of this work presents experimental data of LoRaWAN transmissions inside a\ntypical city building to study signal propagation and path loss. The latter\npart proposes a standalone GNSS-free localization approach using LoRaWAN that\nis achieved by applying a collaborative, TDoA-based methodology. An additional\nstationary node is introduced into the network to allow the synchronization of\ngateways without GNSS. Finally, the distribution of localization error in a\ntriangle of gateways and the effect of timing resolution, time-on-air, and duty\ncycle constraints on it are investigated.",

    "abstract": "Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) assisted multi-access edge\ncomputing (MEC) systems emerged as a promising solution for providing\ncomputation services to mobile users outside of terrestrial infrastructure\ncoverage. As each UAV operates independently, however, it is challenging to\nmeet the computation demands of the mobile users due to the limited computing\ncapacity at the UAV's MEC server as well as the UAV's energy constraint.\nTherefore, collaboration among UAVs is needed. In this paper, a collaborative\nmulti-UAV-assisted MEC system integrated with a MEC-enabled terrestrial base\nstation (BS) is proposed. Then, the problem of minimizing the total latency\nexperienced by the mobile users in the proposed system is studied by optimizing\nthe offloading decision as well as the allocation of communication and\ncomputing resources while satisfying the energy constraints of both mobile\nusers and UAVs. The proposed problem is shown to be a non-convex, mixed-integer\nnonlinear problem (MINLP) that is intractable. Therefore, the formulated\nproblem is decomposed into three subproblems: i) users tasks offloading\ndecision problem, ii) communication resource allocation problem and iii)\nUAV-assisted MEC decision problem. Then, the Lagrangian relaxation and\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) methods are applied to solve\nthe decomposed problems, alternatively. Simulation results show that the\nproposed approach reduces the average latency by up to 40.7\\% and 4.3\\%\ncompared to the greedy and exhaustive search methods.",

Recently, the 2D filter parametrization technique\nplays an important role when designing equivariant convolutions. However, the\ncurrent filter parametrization method still has its evident drawbacks, where\nthe most critical one lies in the accuracy problem of filter representation.\nAgainst this issue, in this paper we modify the classical Fourier series\nexpansion for 2D filters, and propose a new set of atomic basis functions for\nfilter parametrization. The proposed filter parametrization method not only\nfinely represents 2D filters with zero error when the filter is not rotated,\nbut also substantially alleviates the fence-effect-caused quality degradation\nwhen the filter is rotated. Accordingly, we construct a new equivariant\nconvolution method based on the proposed filter parametrization method, named\nF-Conv. We prove that the equivariance of the proposed F-Conv is exact in the\ncontinuous domain, which becomes approximate only after discretization.\nExtensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed method.\nParticularly, we adopt rotation equivariant convolution methods to image\nsuper-resolution task, and F-Conv evidently outperforms previous filter\nparametrization based method in this task, reflecting its intrinsic capability\nof faithfully preserving rotation symmetries in local image features.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the emotional impact of movies has become important for\naffective movie analysis, ranking, and indexing. Methods for recognizing evoked\nemotions are usually trained on human annotated data. Concretely, viewers watch\nvideo clips and have to manually annotate the emotions they experienced while\nwatching the videos. Then, the common practice is to aggregate the different\nannotations, by computing average scores or majority voting, and train and test\nmodels on these aggregated annotations. With this procedure a single aggregated\nevoked emotion annotation is obtained per each video. However, emotions\nexperienced while watching a video are subjective: different individuals might\nexperience different emotions. In this paper, we model the emotions evoked by\nvideos in a different manner: instead of modeling the aggregated value we\njointly model the emotions experienced by each viewer and the aggregated value\nusing a multi-task learning approach. Concretely, we propose two deep learning\narchitectures: a Single-Task (ST) architecture and a Multi-Task (MT)\narchitecture. Our results show that the MT approach can more accurately model\neach viewer and the aggregated annotation when compared to methods that are\ndirectly trained on the aggregated annotations.

One such interesting application is Shadow\nArt - a unique form of sculptural art where 2D shadows cast by a 3D sculpture\nproduce artistic effects. In this work, we revisit shadow art using\ndifferentiable rendering based optimization frameworks to obtain the 3D\nsculpture from a set of shadow (binary) images and their corresponding\nprojection information. Specifically, we discuss shape optimization through\nvoxel as well as mesh-based differentiable renderers.

The qualitative and quantitative\nresults demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework in generating\ncomplex 3D sculptures that go beyond those seen in contemporary art pieces\nusing just a set of shadow images as input.

Additionally, the\ntraffic demand is uneven in terms of spatial and temporal domains, calling for\na dynamic approach to radio resource allocation. To cope with these\ncomplexities, a generic and adaptive scheme is required for the efficient\noperation of Heterogeneous Networks. This article proposes to use a\nhierarchical and modular framework as an approach to cover the mentioned\nchallenges and to generalize this scheme to different network layers. The\nproposed management solution is based on three main components: specialized\nsolutions for individual requirements, exposed to the coordination layer,\nthrough abstraction middleware. In this approach, new items can be added as\nplugins.",

In this\npaper, we present a hybrid approach to computing similarity between artists\nusing graph neural networks trained with triplet loss. The novelty of using a\ngraph neural network architecture is to combine the topology of a graph of\nartist connections with content features to embed artists into a vector space\nthat encodes similarity. To evaluate the proposed method, we compile the new\nOLGA dataset, which contains artist similarities from AllMusic, together with\ncontent features from AcousticBrainz. With 17,673 artists, this is the largest\nacademic artist similarity dataset that includes content-based features to\ndate. Moreover, we also showcase the scalability of our approach by\nexperimenting with a much larger proprietary dataset. Results show the\nsuperiority of the proposed approach over current state-of-the-art methods for\nmusic similarity. Finally, we hope that the OLGA dataset will facilitate\nresearch on data-driven models for artist similarity.",

The current\npractice of operations planning with deterministic optimization models may be\nill-suited for a future with abundant uncertainty. To overcome the potential\nreliability and economic challenges, we present a stochastic hierarchical\nplanning (SHP) framework. This framework captures operations at day-ahead,\nshort-term and hour-ahead timescales, along with the interactions between the\nstochastic processes and decisions. In contrast to earlier studies where\nstochastic optimization of individual problems (e.g., unit commitment, economic\ndispatch) have been studied, this paper studies an integrated framework of\n\\emph{planning under uncertainty}, where stochastic optimization models are\nstitched together in a hierarchical setting which parallels the deterministic\nhierarchical planning approach that is widely adopted in the power industry.\nOur experiments, based on the NREL-118 dataset, reveal that under high\nrenewable penetration, significant operational improvements can be expected by\ntransitioning to the SHP paradigm. In particular, the computational results\nshow that significant improvements can be achieved in several metrics,\nincluding system reliability, environmental sustainability, and system\neconomics, solely by making a strategic choice to adopt the new SHP paradigm.",

Unfortunately, such practices make neural\nnetworks vulnerable to various attacks, where one attack is the backdoor\nattack. In such an attack, the third party training the model may maliciously\ninject hidden behaviors into the model. Still, if a particular input (called\ntrigger) is fed into a neural network, the network will respond with a wrong\nresult.\nIn this work, we explore the option of backdoor attacks to automatic speech\nrecognition systems where we inject inaudible triggers. By doing so, we make\nthe backdoor attack challenging to detect for legitimate users, and thus,\npotentially more dangerous. We conduct experiments on two versions of datasets\nand three neural networks and explore the performance of our attack concerning\nthe duration, position, and type of the trigger. Our results indicate that less\nthan 1% of poisoned data is sufficient to deploy a backdoor attack and reach a\n100% attack success rate.

    "abstract": "Ransomware is a growing threat to individuals and enterprises alike,\nconstituting a major factor in cyber insurance and in the security planning of\nevery organization. Although the game theoretic lens often frames the game as a\ncompetition between equals -- a profit maximizing attacker and a loss\nminimizing defender -- the reality of many situations is that ransomware\norganizations are not playing a non-cooperative game, they are playing a\nlottery. The wanton behavior of attackers creates a situation where many\nvictims are hit more than once by ransomware operators, sometimes even by the\nsame group. If defenders wish to combat malware, they must then seek to remove\nthe incentives of it.\nIn this work, we construct an expected value model based on data from actual\nransomware attacks and identify three variables: the value of payments, the\ncost of an attack, and the probability of payment. Using this model, we\nconsider the potential to manipulate these variables to reduce the profit\nmotive associated with ransomware attack. Based on the model, we present\nmitigations to encourage an environment that is hostile to ransomware\noperators. In particular, we find that off-site backups and government\nincentives for their adoption are the most fruitful avenue for combating\nransomware.",

The problem is more difficult in the context\nof poetry than prose, as in the latter case authors need not be very concise\nwhile expressing their ideas, also the various aspects such as rhyme, poetic\nmeters are not relevant for prose. One of the most effective ways to overcome\nthis writing block for poets can be, to have a prompt system, which would help\ntheir imagination and open their minds for new ideas. A prompt system can\npossibly generate one liner, two liner or full ghazals. The purpose of this\nwork is to give an ode to the Urdu, Hindi poets, and helping them start their\nnext line of poetry, a couplet or a complete ghazal considering various factors\nlike rhymes, refrain, and meters. The result will help aspiring poets to get\nnew ideas and help them overcome writer's block by auto-generating pieces of\npoetry using Deep Learning techniques. A concern with creative works like this,\nespecially in the literary context, is to ensure that the output is not\nplagiarized.

The data-driven formulation results in a minimization problem with a\nLagrange multiplier, where the sought solution must conform to Maxwell's\nequations while at the same time being closest to the available measurement\ndata. The data-driven solver is applied to a three-dimensional model of an\ninductor excited by a DC-current. Numerical results for data sets of increasing\ncardinality verify that the data-driven solver recovers the conventional\nsolution. Furthermore, this work concludes that the data-driven magnetostatic\nfinite element solver is applicable to computationally demanding\nthree-dimensional problems. Simulations with real world measurement data\nfurther show the practical usability of the solver.",

    "abstract": "Localizing pre-visited places during long-term simultaneous localization and\nmapping, i.e. loop closure detection (LCD), is a crucial technique to correct\naccumulated inconsistencies. As one of the most effective and efficient\nsolutions, Bag-of-Words (BoW) builds a visual vocabulary to associate features\nand then detect loops. Most existing approaches that build vocabularies\noff-line determine scales of the vocabulary by trial-and-error, which often\nresults in unreasonable feature association. Moreover, the accuracy of the\nalgorithm usually declines due to perceptual aliasing, as the BoW-based method\nignores the positions of visual features. To overcome these disadvantages, we\npropose a natural convergence criterion based on the comparison between the\nradii of nodes and the drifts of feature descriptors, which is then utilized to\nbuild the optimal vocabulary automatically. Furthermore, we present a novel\ntopological graph verification method for validating candidate loops so that\ngeometrical positions of the words can be involved with a negligible increase\nin complexity, which can significantly improve the accuracy of LCD. Experiments\non various public datasets and comparisons against several state-of-the-art\nalgorithms verify the performance of our proposed approach.",

This work provides a framework for a large-scale and\ncost-efficient evaluation to address AV's ride comfort and allow the comparison\nof different comfort assessment strategies. The proposed tool also gives\ninsights to comfort data, allowing for the development of novel algorithms,\nguidelines, or motion planning systems incorporating passenger comfort. A\nvehicle-road simulation framework utilizable to assess the most common ride\ncomfort determination strategies based on vehicle dynamics data is presented.\nThe developed methodology encompasses a road surface model, a non-linear\nvehicle model optimization, and Monte Carlo simulations to allow for an\naccurate and cost-efficient generation of virtual chassis acceleration data.\nRide comfort is determined by applying a commonly used threshold method and an\nanalysis based on ISO 2631. The two methods are compared against comfort\nclassifications based on empirical measurements of the International Roughness\nIndex (IRI). A case study with three road sites in Austria demonstrates the\nframework's practical application with real data and achieves high-resolution\nride comfort classifications. The results highlight that ISO 2631 comfort\nestimates are most similar to IRI classifications and that the thresholding\nprocedure detects preventable situations but also over- or underestimates ride\ncomfort. Hence, the work shows the potential risk of negative ride comfort of\nAVs using simple threshold values and stresses the importance of a robust\ncomfort evaluation method for enhancing AVs' path and motion planning with\nmaximal ride comfort.",

To alleviate these problems, a video based fall detection approach\nusing human poses is proposed in this paper. First, a lightweight pose\nestimator extracts 2D poses from video sequences and then 2D poses are lifted\nto 3D poses. Second, we introduce a robust fall detection network to recognize\nfall events using estimated 3D poses, which increases respective filed and\nmaintains low computation cost by dilated convolutions. The experimental\nresults show that the proposed fall detection approach achieves a high accuracy\nof 99.83% on large benchmark action recognition dataset NTU RGB+D and real-time\nperformance of 18 FPS on a non-GPU platform and 63 FPS on a GPU platform.",

The approach\n(named a.RIX) operates with a concomitant/interchangeable use of ML models such\nas neuron networks (NNs), latent semantic analysis (LSA) and naive-Bayes\nclassifiers (NBC), and a pattern recognition model using regular expression\n(REGEX). To demonstrate the efficiency of the a.RIX engine, it was processed a\ncorpus of 7,873 scientific articles dealing with natural products (NPs). The\nengine automatically extracts categorical and numerical parameters such as (i)\nthe plant species from which active molecules are extracted, (ii) the\nmicroorganisms species for which active molecules can act against, and (iii)\nthe values of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against these\nmicroorganisms. The parameters are extracted without part-of-speech tagging\n(POS) and named entity recognition (NER) approaches (i.e. without the need of\ntext annotation), and the models training is performed with unsupervised\napproaches. In this way, a.RIX can be essentially used on articles from any\nscientific field.

Leveraging a massive collection of scientific\ntexts, we develop a cue-phrase based approach to identify instances of\ndisagreement citations across more than four million scientific articles. Using\nthis method, we construct an indicator of disagreement across scientific fields\nover the 2000-2015 period. In contrast with black-box text classification\nmethods, our framework is transparent and easily interpretable. We reveal a\ndisciplinary spectrum of disagreement, with higher disagreement in the social\nsciences and lower disagreement in physics and mathematics. However, detailed\ndisciplinary analysis demonstrates heterogeneity across sub-fields, revealing\nthe importance of local disciplinary cultures and epistemic characteristics of\ndisagreement. Paper-level analysis reveals notable episodes of disagreement in\nscience, and illustrates how methodological artefacts can confound analyses of\nscientific texts. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of\ndisagreement and establish a foundation for future research to understanding\nkey processes underlying scientific progress.",

    "abstract": "Voice authentication has become an integral part in security-critical\noperations, such as bank transactions and call center conversations. The\nvulnerability of automatic speaker verification systems (ASVs) to spoofing\nattacks instigated the development of countermeasures (CMs), whose task is to\ntell apart bonafide and spoofed speech. Together, ASVs and CMs form today's\nvoice authentication platforms, advertised as an impregnable access control\nmechanism. We develop the first practical attack on CMs, and show how a\nmalicious actor may efficiently craft audio samples to bypass voice\nauthentication in its strictest form. Previous works have primarily focused on\nnon-proactive attacks or adversarial strategies against ASVs that do not\nproduce speech in the victim's voice. The repercussions of our attacks are far\nmore severe, as the samples we generate sound like the victim, eliminating any\nchance of plausible deniability. Moreover, the few existing adversarial attacks\nagainst CMs mistakenly optimize spoofed speech in the feature space and do not\ntake into account the existence of ASVs, resulting in inferior synthetic audio\nthat fails in realistic settings. We eliminate these obstacles through our key\ntechnical contribution: a novel joint loss function that enables mounting\nadvanced adversarial attacks against combined ASV/CM deployments directly in\nthe time domain. Our adversarials achieve concerning black-box success rates\nagainst state-of-the-art authentication platforms (up to 93.57\\%). Finally, we\nperform the first targeted, over-telephony-network attack on CMs, bypassing\nseveral challenges and enabling various potential threats, given the increased\nuse of voice biometrics in call centers. Our results call into question the\nsecurity of modern voice authentication systems in light of the real threat of\nattackers bypassing these measures to gain access to users' most valuable\nresources.",

To realise autonomous driving, Deep Imitation Learning (DIL) is\ntreated as one of the most promising solutions, because it improves autonomous\ndriving systems by automatically learning a complex mapping from human driving\ndata, compared to manually designing the driving policy. However, existing DIL\nmethods cannot generalise well across domains, that is, a network trained on\nthe data of source domain gives rise to poor generalisation on the data of\ntarget domain. In the present study, we propose a novel brain-inspired deep\nimitation method that builds on the evidence from human brain functions, to\nimprove the generalisation ability of deep neural networks so that autonomous\ndriving systems can perform well in various scenarios. Specifically, humans\nhave a strong generalisation ability which is beneficial from the structural\nand functional asymmetry of the two sides of the brain.

    "title": "Instant Visual Odometry Initialization for Mobile AR",
    "abstract": "Mobile AR applications benefit from fast initialization to display\nworld-locked effects instantly. However, standard visual odometry or SLAM\nalgorithms require motion parallax to initialize (see Figure 1) and, therefore,\nsuffer from delayed initialization. In this paper, we present a 6-DoF monocular\nvisual odometry that initializes instantly and without motion parallax. Our\nmain contribution is a pose estimator that decouples estimating the 5-DoF\nrelative rotation and translation direction from the 1-DoF translation\nmagnitude. While scale is not observable in a monocular vision-only setting, it\nis still paramount to estimate a consistent scale over the whole trajectory\n(even if not physically accurate) to avoid AR effects moving erroneously along\ndepth. In our approach, we leverage the fact that depth errors are not\nperceivable to the user during rotation-only motion. However, as the user\nstarts translating the device, depth becomes perceivable and so does the\ncapability to estimate consistent scale. Our proposed algorithm naturally\ntransitions between these two modes. We perform extensive validations of our\ncontributions with both a publicly available dataset and synthetic data. We\nshow that the proposed pose estimator outperforms the classical approaches for\n6-DoF pose estimation used in the literature in low-parallax configurations. We\nrelease a dataset for the relative pose problem using real data to facilitate\nthe comparison with future solutions for the relative pose problem. Our\nsolution is either used as a full odometry or as a preSLAM component of any\nsupported SLAM system (ARKit, ARCore) in world-locked AR effects on platforms\nsuch as Instagram and Facebook.",

    "abstract": "Next to higher data rates and lower latency, the upcoming fifth-generation\nmobile network standard will introduce a new service ecosystem. Concepts such\nas multi-access edge computing or network slicing will enable tailoring service\nlevel requirements to specific use-cases.

This\nincludes i) small scanners to be wheeled inside the hospital to the bedside and\nii) conventional scanners provided via trucks to remote areas. Both use-cases\nintroduce the need for mobile networks adhering to high safety standards and\nproviding high data rates. These requirements could be met by fifth-generation\nmobile networks. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of transferring\nmedical imaging data using the current state of development of fifth-generation\nmobile networks (3GPP Release 15). We demonstrate the potential of reaching 100\nMbit/s upload rates using already available consumer-grade hardware.\nFurthermore, we show an effective average data throughput of 50 Mbit/s when\ntransferring medical images using out-of-the-box open-source software based on\nthe Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard. During\ntransmissions, we sample the radio frequency bands to analyse the\ncharacteristics of the mobile radio network.

It is used,\nfor example, in Jaynes' maximum entropy principle which is considered a basis\nfor statistical inference and serves as a justification for many regularization\ntechniques that appear throughout machine learning and decision theory. Entropy\nis, however, only one possible monotone that does not fully capture the more\nfundamental notion of uncertainty considered as a preorder on the space of\nprobability distributions, also known as majorization. While the maximum\nentropy principle therefore cannot yield all Pareto optima of the uncertainty\npreorder in general, it has the appealing property that its solutions are\nunique Pareto optima, since it maximizes a strictly concave functional over a\nconvex subset. Here, we investigate a class of monotones on general preordered\nspaces that preserve this uniqueness property (up to order equivalence) on any\nsubset, without asking for the additional vector space structure required for\nconvexity. We show that the class of preorders for which these so-called\ninjective monotones exist, lies in between the class of preorders with strict\nmonotones and preorders with utility functions. We extend several well-known\nresults for strict monotones (Richter-Peleg functions) to injective monotones,\nwe provide a construction of injective monotones from countable\nmulti-utilities, and relate injective monotones to classic results concerning\nDebreu denseness and order separability.

However, with\never-increasing customer populations, this is hard to accomplish without\nextensive customer base studies. There is a need for an automated method for\nidentifying these expectations at a large scale. For this, we used a\ndata-driven approach to our analysis.

We then used dependency parsing and part-of-speech tagging to\nextract nouns tied to positive adjectives. We found that Chinese tourists\nconsider room quality more than hospitality, whereas Westerners are delighted\nmore by staff behavior. Furthermore, the lack of a Chinese-friendly environment\nfor Chinese customers and cigarette smell for Western ones can be disappointing\nfactors of their stay.

    "abstract": "The combination of range sensors with color cameras can be very useful for\nrobot navigation, semantic perception, manipulation, and telepresence. Several\nmethods of combining range- and color-data have been investigated and\nsuccessfully used in various robotic applications. Most of these systems suffer\nfrom the problems of noise in the range-data and resolution mismatch between\nthe range sensor and the color cameras, since the resolution of current range\nsensors is much less than the resolution of color cameras. High-resolution\ndepth maps can be obtained using stereo matching, but this often fails to\nconstruct accurate depth maps of weakly/repetitively textured scenes, or if the\nscene exhibits complex self-occlusions. Range sensors provide coarse depth\ninformation regardless of presence/absence of texture. The use of a calibrated\nsystem, composed of a time-of-flight (TOF) camera and of a stereoscopic camera\npair, allows data fusion thus overcoming the weaknesses of both individual\nsensors. We propose a novel TOF-stereo fusion method based on an efficient\nseed-growing algorithm which uses the TOF data projected onto the stereo image\npair as an initial set of correspondences. These initial \"seeds\" are then\npropagated based on a Bayesian model which combines an image similarity score\nwith rough depth priors computed from the low-resolution range data. The\noverall result is a dense and accurate depth map at the resolution of the color\ncameras at hand. We show that the proposed algorithm outperforms 2D image-based\nstereo algorithms and that the results are of higher resolution than\noff-the-shelf color-range sensors, e.g., Kinect.

The operating cost of a server depends on its load and is modeled\nby an increasing, convex function for each server type.

    "title": "When Deep Learners Change Their Mind: Learning Dynamics for Active  Learning",
    "abstract": "Active learning aims to select samples to be annotated that yield the largest\nperformance improvement for the learning algorithm. Many methods approach this\nproblem by measuring the informativeness of samples and do this based on the\ncertainty of the network predictions for samples. However, it is well-known\nthat neural networks are overly confident about their prediction and are\ntherefore an untrustworthy source to assess sample informativeness. In this\npaper, we propose a new informativeness-based active learning method. Our\nmeasure is derived from the learning dynamics of a neural network. More\nprecisely we track the label assignment of the unlabeled data pool during the\ntraining of the algorithm. We capture the learning dynamics with a metric\ncalled label-dispersion, which is low when the network consistently assigns the\nsame label to the sample during the training of the network and high when the\nassigned label changes frequently. We show that label-dispersion is a promising\npredictor of the uncertainty of the network, and show on two benchmark datasets\nthat an active learning algorithm based on label-dispersion obtains excellent\nresults.",

Today,\nmany robotic platforms are equipped with high-accuracy 3D LiDAR sensors, which\nallow a geometric mapping, and cameras able to provide semantic cues of the\nenvironment. Segment-based mapping and localization have been applied with\ngreat success to 3D point-cloud data, while semantic understanding has been\nshown to improve localization performance in vision based systems. In this\npaper we combine both modalities in SemSegMap, extending SegMap into a segment\nbased mapping framework able to also leverage color and semantic data from the\nenvironment to improve localization accuracy and robustness. In particular, we\npresent new segmentation and descriptor extraction processes. The segmentation\nprocess benefits from additional distance information from color and semantic\nclass consistency resulting in more repeatable segments and more overlap after\nre-visiting a place. For the descriptor, a tight fusion approach in a\ndeep-learned descriptor extraction network is performed leading to a higher\ndescriptiveness for landmark matching. We demonstrate the advantages of this\nfusion on multiple simulated and real-world datasets and compare its\nperformance to various baselines. We show that we are able to find 50.9% more\nhigh-accuracy prior-less global localizations compared to SegMap on challenging\ndatasets using very compact maps while also providing accurate full 6 DoF pose\nestimates in real-time.",

As the huge time consumption of labeling process\non 3D point cloud, domain adaptation for 3D semantic segmentation is of great\nexpectation. With the rise of multi-modal datasets, large amount of 2D images\nare accessible besides 3D point clouds. In light of this, we propose to further\nleverage 2D data for 3D domain adaptation by intra and inter domain cross modal\nlearning. As for intra-domain cross modal learning, most existing works sample\nthe dense 2D pixel-wise features into the same size with sparse 3D point-wise\nfeatures, resulting in the abandon of numerous useful 2D features. To address\nthis problem, we propose Dynamic sparse-to-dense Cross Modal Learning (DsCML)\nto increase the sufficiency of multi-modality information interaction for\ndomain adaptation. For inter-domain cross modal learning, we further advance\nCross Modal Adversarial Learning (CMAL) on 2D and 3D data which contains\ndifferent semantic content aiming to promote high-level modal complementarity.\nWe evaluate our model under various multi-modality domain adaptation settings\nincluding day-to-night, country-to-country and dataset-to-dataset, brings large\nimprovements over both uni-modal and multi-modal domain adaptation methods on\nall settings.",

Our approach combines 4D\nreflectance field learning, model-based facial performance capture and\ntarget-aware neural rendering.

However, when developing fabrication\nplans, experts rarely restrict to a single design, instead considering families\nof design variations, sometimes adjusting designs to simplify fabrication.\nJointly exploring the design and fabrication plan spaces for each design is\nintractable using current techniques. We present a new approach to jointly\noptimize design and fabrication plans for carpentered objects. To make this\nbi-level optimization tractable, we adapt recent work from program synthesis\nbased on equality graphs (e-graphs), which encode sets of equivalent programs.\nOur insight is that subproblems within our bi-level problem share significant\nsubstructures. By representing both designs and fabrication plans in a new bag\nof parts(BOP) e-graph, we amortize the cost of optimizing design components\nshared among multiple candidates. Even using BOP e-graphs, the optimization\nspace grows quickly in practice. Hence, we also show how a feedback-guided\nsearch strategy dubbed Iterative Contraction and Expansion on E-graphs (ICEE)\ncan keep the size of the e-graph manage-able and direct the search toward\npromising candidates.

    "abstract": "The last few years have seen an increasing wave of attacks with serious\neconomic and privacy damages, which evinces the need for accurate Network\nIntrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Recent works propose the use of Machine\nLearning (ML) techniques for building such systems (e.g., decision trees,\nneural networks). However, existing ML-based NIDS are barely robust to common\nadversarial attacks, which limits their applicability to real networks. A\nfundamental problem of these solutions is that they treat and classify flows\nindependently. In contrast, in this paper we argue the importance of focusing\non the structural patterns of attacks, by capturing not only the individual\nflow features, but also the relations between different flows (e.g., the\nsource/destination hosts they share). To this end, we use a graph\nrepresentation that keeps flow records and their relationships, and propose a\nnovel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model tailored to process and learn from such\ngraph-structured information. In our evaluation, we first show that the\nproposed GNN model achieves state-of-the-art results in the well-known\nCIC-IDS2017 dataset. Moreover, we assess the robustness of our solution under\ntwo common adversarial attacks, that intentionally modify the packet size and\ninter-arrival times to avoid detection. The results show that our model is able\nto maintain the same level of accuracy as in previous experiments, while\nstate-of-the-art ML techniques degrade up to 50% their accuracy (F1-score)\nunder these attacks. This unprecedented level of robustness is mainly induced\nby the capability of our GNN model to learn flow patterns of attacks structured\nas graphs.",

In this paper, we focus on the state of the art pairwise ranking\nmodel, Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), which has previously been found to\noutperform pointwise models in predictive accuracy, while also being able to\nhandle implicit feedback. Specifically, we address two limitations of BPR: (1)\nBPR is a black box model that does not explain its outputs, thus limiting the\nuser's trust in the recommendations, and the analyst's ability to scrutinize a\nmodel's outputs; and (2) BPR is vulnerable to exposure bias due to the data\nbeing Missing Not At Random (MNAR). This exposure bias usually translates into\nan unfairness against the least popular items because they risk being\nunder-exposed by the recommender system. In this work, we first propose a novel\nexplainable loss function and a corresponding Matrix Factorization-based model\ncalled Explainable Bayesian Personalized Ranking (EBPR) that generates\nrecommendations along with item-based explanations. Then, we theoretically\nquantify additional exposure bias resulting from the explainability, and use it\nas a basis to propose an unbiased estimator for the ideal EBPR loss.

In the VEC\nsystem, each VU allocates power to process partial tasks through offloading and\nthe remaining tasks through local execution. During the offloading, each VU\nadopts the multi-input multi-out and non-orthogonal multiple access (MIMO-NOMA)\nchannel to improve the channel spectrum efficiency and capacity. However, the\nchannel condition is uncertain due to the channel interference among VUs caused\nby the MIMO-NOMA channel and the time-varying path-loss caused by the mobility\nof each VU. In addition, the task arrival of each VU is stochastic in the real\nworld. The stochastic task arrival and uncertain channel condition affect\ngreatly on the power consumption and latency of tasks for each VU. It is\ncritical to design an optimal power allocation scheme considering the\nstochastic task arrival and channel variation to optimize the long-term reward\nincluding the power consumption and latency in the MIMO-NOMA VEC. Different\nfrom the traditional centralized deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based\nscheme, this paper constructs a decentralized DRL framework to formulate the\npower allocation optimization problem, where the local observations are\nselected as the state. The deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm\nis adopted to learn the optimal power allocation scheme based on the\ndecentralized DRL framework. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed\npower allocation scheme outperforms the existing schemes.",

    "title": "Three-Dimensional Central Moment Lattice Boltzmann Method on a Cuboid  Lattice for Anisotropic and Inhomogeneous Flows",
    "abstract": "We present a new 3D lattice Boltzmann (LB) algorithm based on central moments\nfor the D3Q27 lattice using a cuboid grid, which is parameterized by two grid\naspect ratios that are related to the ratios of the particle speeds with\nrespect to that along a reference coordinate direction. The use of the cuboid\nlattice grid enables the method to compute flows having different\ncharacteristic length scales in different directions more efficiently. It is\nconstructed to simulate the Navier-Stokes equations consistently via\nintroducing counteracting corrections to the second order moment equilibria\nobtained via a Chapman-Enskog analysis that eliminate the errors associated\nwith the grid anisotropy and the non-Galilean invariant terms. The\nimplementation is shown to be compact and modular, with an interpretation based\non special matrices, admitting ready extension of the standard algorithm for\nthe cubic lattice to the cuboid lattice via appropriate scaling of moments\nbased on grid aspect ratios before and after collision step and equilibria\ncorrections. The resulting formulation is general in that the same grid\ncorrections developed for the D3Q27 lattice for recovering the correct viscous\nstress tensor is applicable for other lattice subsets, and a variety of\ncollision models, including those based on the relaxation of raw moments,\ncentral moments and cumulants, as well as their special case involving the\ndistribution functions. The cuboid central moment LBM is validated against a\nvariety of benchmark flows, and when used in lieu of the corresponding raw\nmoment formulation for simulating shear flows, we show that it results in\nsignificant improvements in numerical stability. Finally, we demonstrate that\nour cuboid LB approach is efficient in simulating anisotropic shear flow\nproblems with significant savings in computational cost and memory storage when\ncompared to that based on the cubic lattice.",

    "title": "Synthetic flow-based cryptomining attack generation through Generative  Adversarial Networks",
    "abstract": "Due to the growing rise of cyber attacks in the Internet, flow-based data\nsets are crucial to increase the performance of the Machine Learning (ML)\ncomponents that run in network-based intrusion detection systems (IDS). To\novercome the existing network traffic data shortage in attack analysis, recent\nworks propose Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic flow-based\nnetwork traffic generation. Data privacy is appearing more and more as a strong\nrequirement when processing such network data, which suggests to find solutions\nwhere synthetic data can fully replace real data. Because of the\nill-convergence of the GAN training, none of the existing solutions can\ngenerate high-quality fully synthetic data that can totally substitute real\ndata in the training of IDS ML components. Therefore, they mix real with\nsynthetic data, which acts only as data augmentation components, leading to\nprivacy breaches as real data is used. In sharp contrast, in this work we\npropose a novel deterministic way to measure the quality of the synthetic data\nproduced by a GAN both with respect to the real data and to its performance\nwhen used for ML tasks. As a byproduct, we present a heuristic that uses these\nmetrics for selecting the best performing generator during GAN training,\nleading to a stopping criterion. An additional heuristic is proposed to select\nthe best performing GANs when different types of synthetic data are to be used\nin the same ML task. We demonstrate the adequacy of our proposal by generating\nsynthetic cryptomining attack traffic and normal traffic flow-based data using\nan enhanced version of a Wasserstein GAN. We show that the generated synthetic\nnetwork traffic can completely replace real data when training a ML-based\ncryptomining detector, obtaining similar performance and avoiding privacy\nviolations, since real data is not used in the training of the ML-based\ndetector.",

VAEs\nare Bayesian neural networks that aim to learn a latent statistical\ndistribution to encode extensive data sets as lower dimension representations.\nWe collected 1 600 319 IP decay curves in various regions of Canada, the United\nStates and Kazakhstan, and compiled them to train a deep VAE. The proposed deep\nlearning approach is strictly unsupervised and data-driven: it does not require\nmanual processing or ground truth labeling of IP data. Moreover, our VAE\napproach avoids the pitfalls of IP parametrization with the empirical Cole-Cole\nand Debye decomposition models, simple power-law models, or other sophisticated\nmechanistic models. We demonstrate four applications of VAEs to model and\nprocess IP data: (1) representative synthetic data generation, (2) unsupervised\nBayesian denoising and data uncertainty estimation, (3) quantitative evaluation\nof the signal-to-noise ratio, and (4) automated outlier detection. We also\ninterpret the IP compilation's latent representation and reveal a strong\ncorrelation between its first dimension and the average chargeability of IP\ndecays. Finally, we experiment with varying VAE latent space dimensions and\ndemonstrate that a single real-valued scalar parameter contains sufficient\ninformation to encode our extensive IP data compilation. This new finding\nsuggests that modeling time-domain IP data using mathematical models governed\nby more than one free parameter is ambiguous, whereas modeling only the average\nchargeability is justified.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of studying the simulation capabilities of the\ndynamics of arbitrary networks of finite states machines. In these models, each\nnode of the network takes two states 0 (passive) and 1 (active). The states of\nthe nodes are updated in parallel following a local totalistic rule, i.e.,\ndepending only on the sum of active states. Four families of totalistic rules\nare considered: linear or matrix defined rules (a node takes state 1 if each of\nits neighbours is in state 1), threshold rules (a node takes state 1 if the sum\nof its neighbours exceed a threshold), isolated rules (a node takes state 1 if\nthe sum of its neighbours equals to some single number) and interval rule (a\nnode takes state 1 if the sum of its neighbours belong to some discrete\ninterval). We focus in studying the simulation capabilities of the dynamics of\neach of the latter classes. In particular, we show that totalistic automata\nnetworks governed by matrix defined rules can only implement constant functions\nand other matrix defined functions. In addition, we show that t by threshold\nrules can generate any monotone Boolean functions. Finally, we show that\nnetworks driven by isolated and the interval rules exhibit a very rich spectrum\nof boolean functions as they can, in fact, implement any arbitrary Boolean\nfunctions. We complement this results by studying experimentally the set of\ndifferent Boolean functions generated by totalistic rules on random graphs.",

Here, while the agents' opinions are\nfixed, they have a preferred degree which leads them to endlessly create and\ndelete links. Our evolving network is shaped by homophily/heterophily, which is\na form of social interaction by which individuals tend to establish links with\nothers having similar/dissimilar opinions. Using Monte Carlo simulations and a\ndetailed mean-field analysis, we study in detail how the sizes of the\ncommunities and the degree of homophily/heterophily affects the network\nstructure. In particular, we show that when the network is subject to enough\nheterophily, an \"overwhelming transition\" occurs: individuals of the smaller\ncommunity are overwhelmed by links from agents of the larger group, and their\nmean degree greatly exceeds the preferred degree. This and related phenomena\nare characterized by obtaining the network's total and joint degree\ndistributions, as well as the fraction of links across both communities and\nthat of agents having less edges than the preferred degree.

    "abstract": "Data with low-dimensional nonlinear structure are ubiquitous in engineering\nand scientific problems. We study a model problem with such structure -- a\nbinary classification task that uses a deep fully-connected neural network to\nclassify data drawn from two disjoint smooth curves on the unit sphere. Aside\nfrom mild regularity conditions, we place no restrictions on the configuration\nof the curves. We prove that when (i) the network depth is large relative to\ncertain geometric properties that set the difficulty of the problem and (ii)\nthe network width and number of samples is polynomial in the depth,\nrandomly-initialized gradient descent quickly learns to correctly classify all\npoints on the two curves with high probability. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst generalization guarantee for deep networks with nonlinear data that\ndepends only on intrinsic data properties. Our analysis proceeds by a reduction\nto dynamics in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, where the network depth\nplays the role of a fitting resource in solving the classification problem. In\nparticular, via fine-grained control of the decay properties of the NTK, we\ndemonstrate that when the network is sufficiently deep, the NTK can be locally\napproximated by a translationally invariant operator on the manifolds and\nstably inverted over smooth functions, which guarantees convergence and\ngeneralization.",

    "abstract": "While machine learning approaches have shown remarkable performance in\nbiomedical image analysis, most of these methods rely on high-quality and\naccurate imaging data. However, collecting such data requires intensive and\ncareful manual effort. One of the major challenges in imaging the Shoot Apical\nMeristem (SAM) of Arabidopsis thaliana, is that the deeper slices in the\nz-stack suffer from different perpetual quality-related problems like poor\ncontrast and blurring. These quality-related issues often lead to the disposal\nof the painstakingly collected data with little to no control on quality while\ncollecting the data. Therefore, it becomes necessary to employ and design\ntechniques that can enhance the images to make them more suitable for further\nanalysis. In this paper, we propose a data-driven Deep Quantized Latent\nRepresentation (DQLR) methodology for high-quality image reconstruction in the\nShoot Apical Meristem (SAM) of Arabidopsis thaliana. Our proposed framework\nutilizes multiple consecutive slices in the z-stack to learn a low dimensional\nlatent space, quantize it and subsequently perform reconstruction using the\nquantized representation to obtain sharper images. Experiments on a publicly\navailable dataset validate our methodology showing promising results.",

This paper considers a class of submodular optimization problems that\nconsist of maximization of a monotone and submodular set function subject to a\nuniform matroid constraint over a group of networked agents that communicate\nover a connected undirected graph. We work in the value oracle model where the\nonly access of the agents to the utility function is through a black box that\nreturns the utility function value. We propose a distributed suboptimal\npolynomial-time algorithm that enables each agent to obtain its respective\nstrategy via local interactions with its neighboring agents. Our solution is a\nfully distributed gradient-based algorithm using the submodular set functions'\nmultilinear extension followed by a distributed stochastic Pipage rounding\nprocedure. This algorithm results in a strategy set that when the team utility\nfunction is evaluated at worst case, the utility function value is in\n1/c(1-e^(-c)-O(1/T)) of the optimal solution with c to be the curvature of the\nsubmodular function.

Furthermore, we present a generic method\nto obtain post-inference guarantees of near-optimality and stability for a\nclustering $\\mathcal{C}$.

Obtaining the guarantees amounts to solving a convex optimization\nproblem.

We also prove that asymptotic instability implies finite\nsample instability w.h.p., allowing inferences about the population\nclusterability from a sample.

    "abstract": "The depth information is useful in many image processing applications.\nHowever, since taking a picture is a process of projection of a 3D scene onto a\n2D imaging sensor, the depth information is embedded in the image. Extracting\nthe depth information from the image is a challenging task. A guiding principle\nis that the level of blurriness due to defocus is related to the distance\nbetween the object and the focal plane. Based on this principle and the widely\nused assumption that Gaussian blur is a good model for defocus blur, we\nformulate the problem of estimating the spatially varying defocus blurriness as\na Gaussian blur classification problem. We solved the problem by training a\ndeep neural network to classify image patches into one of the 20 levels of\nblurriness. We have created a dataset of more than 500000 image patches of size\n32x32 which are used to train and test several well-known network models. We\nfind that MobileNetV2 is suitable for this application due to its low memory\nrequirement and high accuracy. The trained model is used to determine the patch\nblurriness which is then refined by applying an iterative weighted guided\nfilter. The result is a defocus map that carries the information of the degree\nof blurriness for each pixel. We compare the proposed method with\nstate-of-the-art techniques and we demonstrate its successful applications in\nadaptive image enhancement, defocus magnification, and multi-focus image\nfusion.",

The uPIT criterion\nwas proposed for utterance-level separation with neural networks and introduces\nthe constraint that the total number of speakers must not exceed the number of\noutput channels. When processing meeting-like data in a segment-wise manner,\ni.e., by separating overlapping segments independently and stitching adjacent\nsegments to continuous output streams, this constraint has to be fulfilled for\nany segment. In this contribution, we show that this constraint can be\nsignificantly relaxed. We propose a novel graph-based PIT criterion, which\ncasts the assignment of utterances to output channels in a graph coloring\nproblem. It only requires that the number of concurrently active speakers must\nnot exceed the number of output channels. As a consequence, the system can\nprocess an arbitrary number of speakers and arbitrarily long segments and thus\ncan handle more diverse scenarios. Further, the stitching algorithm for\nobtaining a consistent output order in neighboring segments is of less\nimportance and can even be eliminated completely, not the least reducing the\ncomputational effort.

To build effective models of the chemistry of materials,\nuseful machine-based representations of atoms and their compounds are required.\nWe derive distributed representations of compounds from their chemical formulas\nonly, via pooling operations of distributed representations of atoms. These\ncompound representations are evaluated on ten different tasks, such as the\nprediction of formation energy and band gap, and are found to be competitive\nwith existing benchmarks that make use of structure, and even superior in cases\nwhere only composition is available. Finally, we introduce a new approach for\nlearning distributed representations of atoms, named SkipAtom, which makes use\nof the growing information in materials structure databases.",

The\ngoal of the paper is to apprehend short-term market movement, and incorporate\nit to improve the underlying stochastic model. Also, the analysis presented in\nthis paper can be implemented in a \\emph{model-independent} fashion. We execute\na data-science-driven technique that makes short-term forecasts dependent on\nthe price trends of current stock market data. Based on the analysis, three\ndifferent labels are generated for a data set: $+1$ (buy signal), $0$ (hold\nsignal), or $-1$ (sell signal). We propose a detailed analysis of four major\nstocks- Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft. We implement various technical\nindicators to label the data set according to the trend and train various\nmodels for trend estimation. Statistical analysis of the outputs and\nclassification results are obtained.",

    "title": "System efficiency of US wind power generation is declining",
    "abstract": "US Wind power generation has grown significantly over the last decades,\ncontributing to the decarbonisation of the US power system. However, the\ntechnology also causes negative impacts. Technological progress and choice of\nlocations could, however, decrease these impacts per unit of generated wind\npower. We assess for the US, which has the second largest wind power fleet\nglobally, how these factors have changed in the period 2010--2019. For that\npurpose, we combine wind power generation time series, data on installed wind\nturbines, and wind speed time series to decompose the growth of US wind power\ngeneration into its driving factors. We show that wind resources per rotor\nswept area have increased during the last decade, but system efficiency, i.e.\nthe relation of kinetic power in the wind to wind power generation, has\ndeclined stronger. Therefore, less electric power was extracted per rotor swept\narea in 2019 than 10 years before.",

    "title": "A Multi-Head Relevance Weighting Framework For Learning Raw Waveform  Audio Representations",
    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a multi-head relevance weighting framework to learn\naudio representations from raw waveforms. The audio waveform, split into\nwindows of short duration, are processed with a 1-D convolutional layer of\ncosine modulated Gaussian filters acting as a learnable filterbank. The key\nnovelty of the proposed framework is the introduction of multi-head relevance\non the learnt filterbank representations. Each head of the relevance network is\nmodelled as a separate sub-network. These heads perform representation\nenhancement by generating weight masks for different parts of the\ntime-frequency representation learnt by the parametric acoustic filterbank\nlayer. The relevance weighted representations are fed to a neural classifier\nand the whole system is trained jointly for the audio classification objective.\nExperiments are performed on the DCASE2020 Task 1A challenge as well as the\nUrban Sound Classification (USC) tasks. In these experiments, the proposed\napproach yields relative improvements of 10% and 23% respectively for the\nDCASE2020 and USC datasets over the mel-spectrogram baseline. Also, the\nanalysis of multi-head relevance weights provides insights on the learned\nrepresentations.",

    "abstract": "This work tackles the issue of noise removal from images, focusing on the\nwell-known DCT image denoising algorithm. The latter, stemming from signal\nprocessing, has been well studied over the years. Though very simple, it is\nstill used in crucial parts of state-of-the-art \"traditional\" denoising\nalgorithms such as BM3D. Since a few years however, deep convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNN) have outperformed their traditional counterparts, making signal\nprocessing methods less attractive. In this paper, we demonstrate that a DCT\ndenoiser can be seen as a shallow CNN and thereby its original linear transform\ncan be tuned through gradient descent in a supervised manner, improving\nconsiderably its performance. This gives birth to a fully interpretable CNN\ncalled DCT2net. To deal with remaining artifacts induced by DCT2net, an\noriginal hybrid solution between DCT and DCT2net is proposed combining the best\nthat these two methods can offer; DCT2net is selected to process non-stationary\nimage patches while DCT is optimal for piecewise smooth patches. Experiments on\nartificially noisy images demonstrate that two-layer DCT2net provides\ncomparable results to BM3D and is as fast as DnCNN algorithm composed of more\nthan a dozen of layers.",
