The existing methods are based on feed-forward\nnetworks, {while} recurrent neural network differential equation solvers have\nnot yet been reported. We introduce an unsupervised reservoir computing (RC),\nan echo-state recurrent neural network capable of discovering approximate\nsolutions that satisfy ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We suggest an\napproach to calculate time derivatives of recurrent neural network outputs\nwithout using backpropagation. The internal weights of an RC are fixed, while\nonly a linear output layer is trained, yielding efficient training. However, RC\nperformance strongly depends on finding the optimal hyper-parameters, which is\na computationally expensive process. We use Bayesian optimization to\nefficiently discover optimal sets in a high-dimensional hyper-parameter space\nand numerically show that one set is robust and can be used to solve an ODE for\ndifferent initial conditions and time ranges. A closed-form formula for the\noptimal output weights is derived to solve first order linear equations in a\nbackpropagation-free learning process. We extend the RC approach by solving\nnonlinear system of ODEs using a hybrid optimization method consisting of\ngradient descent and Bayesian optimization. Evaluation of linear and nonlinear\nsystems of equations demonstrates the efficiency of the RC ODE solver.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-speech and co-speech gesture synthesis have until now been treated as\nseparate areas by two different research communities, and applications merely\nstack the two technologies using a simple system-level pipeline. This can lead\nto modeling inefficiencies and may introduce inconsistencies that limit the\nachievable naturalness. We propose to instead synthesize the two modalities in\na single model, a new problem we call integrated speech and gesture synthesis\n(ISG). We also propose a set of models modified from state-of-the-art neural\nspeech-synthesis engines to achieve this goal. We evaluate the models in three\ncarefully-designed user studies, two of which evaluate the synthesized speech\nand gesture in isolation, plus a combined study that evaluates the models like\nthey will be used in real-world applications -- speech and gesture presented\ntogether. The results show that participants rate one of the proposed\nintegrated synthesis models as being as good as the state-of-the-art pipeline\nsystem we compare against, in all three tests. The model is able to achieve\nthis with faster synthesis time and greatly reduced parameter count compared to\nthe pipeline system, illustrating some of the potential benefits of treating\nspeech and gesture synthesis together as a single, unified problem.

Current\nstate-of-the-art approaches mainly follow a two-stage training strategy\nwhichintegrates a fully supervised detector (FSD) with a pure WSOD model. There\nare two main problems hindering the performance of the two-phase WSOD\napproaches, i.e., insufficient learning problem and strict reliance between the\nFSD and the pseudo ground truth (PGT) generated by theWSOD model. This paper\nproposes pseudo ground truth refinement network (PGTRNet), a simple yet\neffective method without introducing any extra learnable parameters, to cope\nwith these problems.

    "abstract": "Massively parallel systolic arrays and resource-efficient depthwise separable\nconvolutions are two promising techniques to accelerate DNN inference on the\nedge. Interestingly, their combination is inefficient: Computational patterns\nof depthwise separable convolutions do not exhibit a rhythmic systolic flow and\nlack sufficient data reuse to saturate systolic arrays. We formally analyse\nthis inefficiency and propose an efficient operator, an optimal hardware\ndataflow, and a superior training methodology towards alleviating this. The\nefficient operator, called FuSeConv, is a drop-in replacement for depthwise\nseparable convolutions. FuSeConv factorizes convolution fully along their\nspatial and depth dimensions. The resultant computation efficiently maps to\nsystolic arrays. The optimal dataflow, called Spatial-Tiled Output Stationary\n(ST-OS), maximizes the efficiency of FuSeConv on systolic arrays. It maps\nindependent convolutions to rows of the array to maximize resource utilization\nwith negligible VLSI overheads. Neural Operator Scaffolding (NOS) scaffolds the\ntraining of FuSeConv by distilling knowledge from the expensive depthwise\nseparable convolutions. This bridges the accuracy gap between FuSeConv networks\nand baselines. Additionally, NOS can be combined with Neural Architecture\nSearch (NAS) to trade-off latency and accuracy. The HW/SW co-design of FuSeConv\nwith ST-OS achieves a significant speedup of 4.1-9.25X with state-of-the-art\nefficient networks for ImageNet. The parameter efficiency of FuSeConv and its\nsignificant out-performance over depthwise separable convolutions on systolic\narrays illustrates their promise as a strong solution on the edge. Training\nFuSeConv networks with NOS achieves accuracy comparable to the baselines.\nFurther, by combining NOS with NAS, we design networks that define\nstate-of-the-art models improving on both accuracy and latency on systolic\narrays.",

Our core contribution is the mapping of the human body\nsurface to the space of metrics and normals. We equip this space with a family\nof Riemannian metrics, called Ebin (or DeWitt) metrics. We treat a human body\nsurface as a point in a \"shape space\" equipped with a family of Riemmanian\nmetrics. The family of metrics is invariant under rigid motions and\nreparametrizations; hence it induces a metric on the \"shape space\" of surfaces.\nUsing the alignment of human bodies with a given template, we show that this\nfamily of metrics allows us to distinguish the changes in shape and pose. The\nproposed framework has several advantages. First, we define family of metrics\nwith desired invariant properties for the comparison of human shape. Second, we\npresent an efficient framework to compute geodesic paths between human shape\ngiven the chosen metric.

Our\nexperiments reveal that self-training is remarkably more efficient than active\nlearning at reducing the labeling effort, that for a low labeling budget,\nactive learning offers no benefit to self-training, and finally that the\ncombination of active learning and self-training is fruitful when the labeling\nbudget is high.

Excavating relevant content from deep within these audio\nstreams for diverse types of information needs requires varying the approach to\nsystems prototyping. We describe a set of diverse podcast information needs and\ndifferent approaches to assessing retrieved content for relevance.

    "abstract": "Inspired by a new feature in 5G NR called bandwidth part (BWP), this paper\npresents a bandwidth allocation (BA) model that allows one to adapt the\nbandwidth allocated to users depending on their data rate needs. Specifically,\nin adaptive BA, a wide bandwidth is divided into chunks of smaller bandwidths\nand the number of bandwidth chunks allocated to a user depends on its needs or\ntype. Although BWP in 5G NR mandates allocation of a set of contiguous\nbandwidth chunks, our BA model also allows other assumptions on chunk\nallocation such as the allocation of any set of bandwidth chunks, as in, e.g.,\nLTE resource allocation, where chunks are selected uniformly at random. The BA\nmodel studied here is probabilistic in that the user locations are assumed to\nform a realization of a Poisson point process and each user decides\nindependently to be of a certain type with some probability. This model allows\none to quantify spectrum sharing and service differentiation in this context,\nnamely to predict what performance a user gets depending on its type as well as\nthe overall performance. This is based on exact representations of key\nperformance metrics for each user type, namely its success probability, the\nmeta distribution of its signal-to-interference ratio, and its Shannon\nthroughput. We show that, surprisingly, the higher traffic variability stemming\nfrom adaptive BA is beneficial: when comparing two networks using adaptive BA\nand having the same mean signal and the same mean interference powers, the\nnetwork with higher traffic variability performs better for all these\nperformance metrics. With respect to Shannon throughput, we observe that our BA\nmodel is roughly egalitarian per Hertz and leads to a linear service\ndifferentiation in aggregated throughput value.",

Two\nfamilies of approaches have emerged, depending on whether documents and queries\nare represented by single or multiple embeddings.

In this manner, a large number of documents can be\nretrieved for each query, hindering the efficiency of the approach. In this\nwork, we investigate the use of ANN scores for ranking the candidate documents,\nin order to decrease the number of candidate documents being fully scored.\nExperiments conducted on the MSMARCO passage ranking corpus demonstrate that,\nby cutting of the candidate set by using the approximate scores to only 200\ndocuments, we can still obtain an effective ranking without statistically\nsignificant differences in effectiveness, and resulting in a 2x speedup in\nefficiency.",

    "abstract": "Memory disaggregation provides efficient memory utilization across\nnetwork-connected systems. It allows a node to use part of memory in remote\nnodes in the same cluster. Recent studies have improved RDMA-based memory\ndisaggregation systems, supporting lower latency and higher bandwidth than the\nprior generation of disaggregated memory. However, the current disaggregated\nmemory systems manage remote memory only at coarse granularity due to the\nlimitation of the access validation mechanism of RDMA. In such systems, to\nsupport fine-grained remote page allocation, the trustworthiness of all\nparticipating systems needs to be assumed, and thus a security breach in a node\ncan propagate to the entire cluster. From the security perspective, the\nmemory-providing node must protect its memory from memory-requesting nodes. On\nthe other hand, the memory-requesting node requires the confidentiality and\nintegrity protection of its memory contents even if they are stored in remote\nnodes. To address the weak isolation support in the current system, this study\nproposes a novel hardware-assisted memory disaggregation system. Based on the\nsecurity features of FPGA, the logic in each per-node FPGA board provides a\nsecure memory disaggregation engine. With its own networks, a set of FPGA-based\nengines form a trusted memory disaggregation system, which is isolated from the\nprivileged software of each participating node. The secure memory\ndisaggregation system allows fine-grained memory management in memory-providing\nnodes, while the access validation is guaranteed with the hardware-hardened\nmechanism. In addition, the proposed system hides the memory access patterns\nobservable from remote nodes, supporting obliviousness. Our evaluation with\nFPGA implementation shows that such fine-grained secure disaggregated memory is\nfeasible with comparable performance to the latest software-based techniques.",

Existing methods that attempt to\nresolve these problems, either rule-based or neural architecture search\n(NAS)-based, need extensive efforts on the human design or network training.\nThey are also not flexible in embedding size selection or in warm-start-based\napplications. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective embedding size\nselection scheme. Specifically, we design an Adaptively-Masked Twins-based\nLayer (AMTL) behind the standard embedding layer. AMTL generates a mask vector\nto mask the undesired dimensions for each embedding vector. The mask vector\nbrings flexibility in selecting the dimensions and the proposed layer can be\neasily added to either untrained or trained DLRMs. Extensive experimental\nevaluations show that the proposed scheme outperforms competitive baselines on\nall the benchmark tasks, and is also memory-efficient, saving 60\\% memory usage\nwithout compromising any performance metrics.",

The Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM)\nis a type of unsupervised artificial neural network for visualizing and\nclustering complex data, reducing the dimensionality of data, and selecting\ninfluential features. Like all clustering methods, the SOM requires a measure\nof similarity between input data (in this work time series). Dynamic time\nwarping (DTW) is one such measure, and a top performer given that it\naccommodates the distortions when aligning time series. Despite its use in\nclustering, DTW is limited in practice because it is quadratic in runtime\ncomplexity with the length of the time series data. To address this, we present\na new DTW-based clustering method, called SOMTimeS (a Self-Organizing Map for\nTIME Series), that scales better and runs faster than other DTW-based\nclustering algorithms, and has similar performance accuracy. The computational\nperformance of SOMTimeS stems from its ability to prune unnecessary DTW\ncomputations during the SOM's training phase. We also implemented a similar\npruning strategy for K-means for comparison with one of the top performing\nclustering algorithms. We evaluated the pruning effectiveness, accuracy,\nexecution time and scalability on 112 benchmark time series datasets from the\nUniversity of California, Riverside classification archive. We showed that for\nsimilar accuracy, the speed-up achieved for SOMTimeS and K-means was 1.8x on\naverage; however, rates varied between 1x and 18x depending on the dataset.\nSOMTimeS and K-means pruned 43% and 50% of the total DTW computations,\nrespectively.

To solve the two issues\nmentioned above, we propose TPH-YOLOv5. Based on YOLOv5, we add one more\nprediction head to detect different-scale objects. Then we replace the original\nprediction heads with Transformer Prediction Heads (TPH) to explore the\nprediction potential with self-attention mechanism.

In this paper, we consider $StrClu$ under two commonly adapted\nsimilarities, namely Jaccard similarity and cosine similarity on a dynamic\ngraph, $G = \\langle V, E\\rangle$, subject to edge insertions and deletions\n(updates). The goal is to maintain certain information under updates, so that\nthe $StrClu$ clustering result on~$G$ can be retrieved in $O(|V| + |E|)$ time,\nupon request. The state-of-the-art worst-case cost is $O(|V|)$ per update; we\nimprove this update-time bound significantly with the $\\rho$-approximate\nnotion. Specifically, for a specified failure probability, $\\delta^*$, and\nevery sequence of $M$ updates (no need to know $M$'s value in advance), our\nalgorithm, $DynELM$, achieves $O(\\log^2 |V| + \\log |V| \\cdot \\log\n\\frac{M}{\\delta^*})$ amortized cost for each update, at all times in linear\nspace.

    "abstract": "Achieving short-distance flight helps improve the efficiency of humanoid\nrobots moving in complex environments (e.g., crossing large obstacles or\nreaching high places) for rapid emergency missions. This study proposes a\ndesign of a flying humanoid robot named Jet-HR2. The robot has 10 joints driven\nby brushless motors and harmonic drives for locomotion. To overcome the\nchallenge of the stable-attitude takeoff in small thrust-to-weight conditions,\nthe robot was designed based on the concept of thrust vectoring. The propulsion\nsystem consists of four ducted fans, that is, two fixed on the waist of the\nrobot and the other two mounted on the feet, for thrust vector control. The\nthrust vector is controlled by adjusting the attitude of the foot during the\nflight. A simplified model and control strategies are proposed to solve the\nproblem of attitude instability caused by mass errors and joint position errors\nduring takeoff. The experimental results show that the robot's spin and dive\nbehaviors during takeoff were effectively suppressed by controlling the thrust\nvector of the ducted fan on the foot. The robot successfully achieved takeoff\nat a thrust-to-weight ratio of 1.17 (17 kg / 20 kg) and maintained a stable\nattitude, reaching a takeoff height of over 1000 mm.",

    "abstract": "State estimation is a data processing algorithm for converting redundant\nmeter measurements and other information into an estimate of the state of a\npower system. Relying heavily on meter measurements, state estimation has\nproven to be vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this paper, a novel targeted false\ndata injection attack (FDIA) model against AC state estimation is proposed.\nLeveraging on the intrinsic load dynamics in ambient conditions and important\nproperties of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we, from the viewpoint of\nintruders, design an algorithm to extract power network parameters purely from\nPMU data, which are further used to construct the FDIA vector. Requiring no\nnetwork parameters and relying only on limited phasor measurement unit (PMU)\ndata, the proposed FDIA model can target specific states and launch large\ndeviation attacks. Sufficient conditions for the proposed FDIA model are also\ndeveloped. Various attack vectors and attacking regions are studied in the IEEE\n39-bus system, showing that the proposed FDIA method can successfully bypass\nthe bad data detection and launch targeted large deviation attacks with very\nhigh probabilities.",

    "abstract": "Action detection plays an important role in high-level video understanding\nand media interpretation. Many existing studies fulfill this spatio-temporal\nlocalization by modeling the context, capturing the relationship of actors,\nobjects, and scenes conveyed in the video.

In this paper, we\nexplicitly highlight the identity information of the actors in terms of both\nlong-term and short-term context through a graph memory network, namely\nidentity-aware graph memory network (IGMN). Specifically, we propose the\nhierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) to comprehensively conduct long-term\nrelation modeling within the same identity as well as between different ones.\nRegarding short-term context, we develop a dual attention module (DAM) to\ngenerate identity-aware constraint to reduce the influence of interference by\nthe actors of different identities.

    "title": "Robust Long-Tailed Learning under Label Noise",
    "abstract": "Long-tailed learning has attracted much attention recently, with the goal of\nimproving generalisation for tail classes. Most existing works use supervised\nlearning without considering the prevailing noise in the training dataset. To\nmove long-tailed learning towards more realistic scenarios, this work\ninvestigates the label noise problem under long-tailed label distribution. We\nfirst observe the negative impact of noisy labels on the performance of\nexisting methods, revealing the intrinsic challenges of this problem. As the\nmost commonly used approach to cope with noisy labels in previous literature,\nwe then find that the small-loss trick fails under long-tailed label\ndistribution. The reason is that deep neural networks cannot distinguish\ncorrectly-labeled and mislabeled examples on tail classes. To overcome this\nlimitation, we establish a new prototypical noise detection method by designing\na distance-based metric that is resistant to label noise. Based on the above\nfindings, we propose a robust framework,~\\algo, that realizes noise detection\nfor long-tailed learning, followed by soft pseudo-labeling via both label\nsmoothing and diverse label guessing. Moreover, our framework can naturally\nleverage semi-supervised learning algorithms to further improve the\ngeneralisation. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of our methods over existing baselines. In\nparticular, our method outperforms DivideMix by 3\\% in test accuracy. Source\ncode will be released soon.",

    "abstract": "Sampling is a critical operation in the training of Graph Neural Network\n(GNN) that helps reduce the cost. Previous works have explored improving\nsampling algorithms through mathematical and statistical methods. However,\nthere is a gap between sampling algorithms and hardware. Without consideration\nof hardware, algorithm designers merely optimize sampling at the algorithm\nlevel, missing the great potential of promoting the efficiency of existing\nsampling algorithms by leveraging hardware features. In this paper, we first\npropose a unified programming model for mainstream sampling algorithms, termed\nGNNSampler, covering the key processes for sampling algorithms in various\ncategories. Second, we explore the data locality among nodes and their\nneighbors (i.e., the hardware feature) in real-world datasets for alleviating\nthe irregular memory access in sampling. Third, we implement locality-aware\noptimizations in GNNSampler for diverse sampling algorithms to optimize the\ngeneral sampling process in the training of GNN. Finally, we emphatically\nconduct experiments on large graph datasets to analyze the relevance between\nthe training time, model accuracy, and hardware-level metrics, which helps\nachieve a good trade-off between time and accuracy in GNN training. Extensive\nexperimental results show that our method is universal to mainstream sampling\nalgorithms and reduces the training time of GNN (range from 4.83% with\nlayer-wise sampling to 44.92% with subgraph-based sampling) with comparable\naccuracy.",

    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal representational learning has been widely adopted in various\nfields such as action recognition, video object segmentation, and action\nanticipation. Previous spatio-temporal representational learning approaches\nprimarily employ ConvNets or sequential models,e.g., LSTM, to learn the\nintra-frame and inter-frame features. Recently, Transformer models have\nsuccessfully dominated the study of natural language processing (NLP), image\nclassification, etc. However, the pure-Transformer based spatio-temporal\nlearning can be prohibitively costly on memory and computation to extract\nfine-grained features from a tiny patch. To tackle the training difficulty and\nenhance the spatio-temporal learning, we construct a shifted chunk Transformer\nwith pure self-attention blocks. Leveraging the recent efficient Transformer\ndesign in NLP, this shifted chunk Transformer can learn hierarchical\nspatio-temporal features from a local tiny patch to a global video clip. Our\nshifted self-attention can also effectively model complicated inter-frame\nvariances. Furthermore, we build a clip encoder based on Transformer to model\nlong-term temporal dependencies. We conduct thorough ablation studies to\nvalidate each component and hyper-parameters in our shifted chunk Transformer,\nand it outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on Kinetics-400,\nKinetics-600, UCF101, and HMDB51.

Applying this method to five large-scale item response datasets from\ncognitive science and education yields higher log likelihoods and higher\naccuracy in imputing missing data than alternative inference algorithms.

Intrinsically, developers often recall parts of source\ncode or code summaries that they had written in the past while implementing\nsoftware or documenting them. To mimic developers' code or summary generation\nbehavior, we propose a retrieval augmented framework, \\tool, that retrieves\nrelevant code or summaries from a retrieval database and provides them as a\nsupplement to code generation or summarization models. \\tool has a couple of\nuniqueness. First, it extends the state-of-the-art dense retrieval technique to\nsearch for relevant code or summaries. Second, it can work with retrieval\ndatabases that include unimodal (only code or natural language description) or\nbimodal instances (code-description pairs). We conduct experiments and\nextensive analysis on two benchmark datasets of code generation and\nsummarization in Java and Python, and the promising results endorse the\neffectiveness of our proposed retrieval augmented framework.",

    "title": "Identification of the Resting Position Based on EGG, ECG, Respiration  Rate and SpO2 Using Stacked Ensemble Learning",
    "abstract": "Rest is essential for a high-level physiological and psychological\nperformance. It is also necessary for the muscles to repair, rebuild, and\nstrengthen. There is a significant correlation between the quality of rest and\nthe resting posture. Therefore, identification of the resting position is of\nparamount importance to maintain a healthy life. Resting postures can be\nclassified into four basic categories: Lying on the back (supine), facing of\nthe left / right sides and free-fall position. The later position is already\nconsidered to be an unhealthy posture by researchers equivocally and hence can\nbe eliminated. In this paper, we analyzed the other three states of resting\nposition based on the data collected from the physiological parameters:\nElectrogastrogram (EGG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), Respiration Rate, Heart Rate,\nand Oxygen Saturation (SpO2). Based on these parameters, the resting position\nis classified using a hybrid stacked ensemble machine learning model designed\nusing the Decision tree, Random Forest, and Xgboost algorithms. Our study\ndemonstrates a 100% accurate prediction of the resting position using the\nhybrid model. The proposed method of identifying the resting position based on\nphysiological parameters has the potential to be integrated into wearable\ndevices. This is a low cost, highly accurate and autonomous technique to\nmonitor the body posture while maintaining the user privacy by eliminating the\nuse of RGB camera conventionally used to conduct the polysomnography (sleep\nMonitoring) or resting position studies.",

    "abstract": "In many situations (e.g., distant supervision), unlabeled entity problem\nseriously degrades the performances of named entity recognition (NER) models.\nRecently, this issue has been well addressed by a notable approach based on\nnegative sampling. In this work, we perform two studies along this direction.\nFirstly, we analyze why negative sampling succeeds both theoretically and\nempirically. Based on the observation that named entities are highly sparse in\ndatasets, we show a theoretical guarantee that, for a long sentence, the\nprobability of containing no unlabeled entities in sampled negatives is high.\nMissampling tests on synthetic datasets have verified our guarantee in\npractice. Secondly, to mine hard negatives and further reduce missampling\nrates, we propose a weighted and adaptive sampling distribution for negative\nsampling. Experiments on synthetic datasets and well-annotated datasets show\nthat our method significantly improves negative sampling in robustness and\neffectiveness. We also have achieved new state-of-the-art results on real-world\ndatasets.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, an increased effort has been invested to improve the\ncapabilities of robots. Nevertheless, human-robot interaction remains a complex\nfield of application where errors occur frequently. The reasons for these\nerrors can primarily be divided into two classes. Foremost, the recent increase\nin capabilities also widened possible sources of errors on the robot's side.\nThis entails problems in the perception of the world, but also faulty behavior,\nbased on errors in the system. Apart from that, non-expert users frequently\nhave incorrect assumptions about the functionality and limitations of a robotic\nsystem. This leads to incompatibilities between the user's behavior and the\nfunctioning of the robot's system, causing problems on the robot's side and in\nthe human-robot interaction. While engineers constantly improve the reliability\nof robots, the user's understanding about robots and their limitations have to\nbe addressed as well. In this work, we investigate ways to improve the\nunderstanding about robots. For this, we employ FAMILIAR - FunctionAl user\nMental model by Increased LegIbility ARchitecture, a transparent robot\narchitecture with regard to the robot behavior and decision-making process. We\nconducted an online simulation user study to evaluate two complementary\napproaches to convey and increase the knowledge about this architecture to\nnon-expert users: a dynamic visualization of the system's processes as well as\na visual programming interface. The results of this study reveal that visual\nprogramming improves knowledge about the architecture. Furthermore, we show\nthat with increased knowledge about the control architecture of the robot,\nusers were significantly better in reaching the interaction goal. Furthermore,\nwe showed that anthropomorphism may reduce interaction success.",

    "abstract": "Shape correspondence from 3D deformation learning has attracted appealing\nacademy interests recently. Nevertheless, current deep learning based methods\nrequire the supervision of dense annotations to learn per-point translations,\nwhich severely overparameterize the deformation process. Moreover, they fail to\ncapture local geometric details of original shape via global feature embedding.\nTo address these challenges, we develop a new Unsupervised Dense Deformation\nEmbedding Network (i.e., UD^2E-Net), which learns to predict deformations\nbetween non-rigid shapes from dense local features. Since it is non-trivial to\nmatch deformation-variant local features for deformation prediction, we develop\nan Extrinsic-Intrinsic Autoencoder to frst encode extrinsic geometric features\nfrom source into intrinsic coordinates in a shared canonical shape, with which\nthe decoder then synthesizes corresponding target features. Moreover, a bounded\nmaximum mean discrepancy loss is developed to mitigate the distribution\ndivergence between the synthesized and original features. To learn natural\ndeformation without dense supervision, we introduce a coarse parameterized\ndeformation graph, for which a novel trace and propagation algorithm is\nproposed to improve both the quality and effciency of the deformation. Our\nUD^2E-Net outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by 24% on Faust\nInter challenge and even supervised methods by 13% on Faust Intra challenge.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, given a small bag of images, each containing a common but\nlatent predicate, we are interested in localizing visual subject-object pairs\nconnected via the common predicate in each of the images. We refer to this\nnovel problem as visual relationship co-localization or VRC as an abbreviation.\nVRC is a challenging task, even more so than the well-studied object\nco-localization task. This becomes further challenging when using just a few\nimages, the model has to learn to co-localize visual subject-object pairs\nconnected via unseen predicates. To solve VRC, we propose an optimization\nframework to select a common visual relationship in each image of the bag. The\ngoal of the optimization framework is to find the optimal solution by learning\nvisual relationship similarity across images in a few-shot setting. To obtain\nrobust visual relationship representation, we utilize a simple yet effective\ntechnique that learns relationship embedding as a translation vector from\nvisual subject to visual object in a shared space. Further, to learn visual\nrelationship similarity, we utilize a proven meta-learning technique commonly\nused for few-shot classification tasks. Finally, to tackle the combinatorial\ncomplexity challenge arising from an exponential number of feasible solutions,\nwe use a greedy approximation inference algorithm that selects approximately\nthe best solution.\nWe extensively evaluate our proposed framework on variations of bag sizes\nobtained from two challenging public datasets, namely VrR-VG and VG-150, and\nachieve impressive visual co-localization performance.",

    "abstract": "Safety is essential for reinforcement learning (RL) applied in the real\nworld. Adding chance constraints (or probabilistic constraints) is a suitable\nway to enhance RL safety under uncertainty. Existing chance-constrained RL\nmethods like the penalty methods and the Lagrangian methods either exhibit\nperiodic oscillations or learn an over-conservative or unsafe policy. In this\npaper, we address these shortcomings by proposing a separated\nproportional-integral Lagrangian (SPIL) algorithm. We first review the\nconstrained policy optimization process from a feedback control perspective,\nwhich regards the penalty weight as the control input and the safe probability\nas the control output. Based on this, the penalty method is formulated as a\nproportional controller, and the Lagrangian method is formulated as an integral\ncontroller. We then unify them and present a proportional-integral Lagrangian\nmethod to get both their merits, with an integral separation technique to limit\nthe integral value in a reasonable range. To accelerate training, the gradient\nof safe probability is computed in a model-based manner. We demonstrate our\nmethod can reduce the oscillations and conservatism of RL policy in a\ncar-following simulation.

Existing work predominantly utilizes\neither, (i) a pixelative format that treats sketches as natural images\nemploying off-the-shelf CNN-based networks, or (ii) an elaborately designed\nvector format that leverages the structural information of drawing orders using\nsequential RNN-based methods. While the pixelative format lacks intuitive\nexploitation of structural cues, sketches in vector format are absent in most\ncases limiting their practical usage. Hence, in this paper, we propose a\nlattice structured sketch representation that not only removes the bottleneck\nof requiring vector data but also preserves the structural cues that vector\ndata provides. Essentially, sketch lattice is a set of points sampled from the\npixelative format of the sketch using a lattice graph. We show that our lattice\nstructure is particularly amenable to structural changes that largely benefits\nsketch abstraction modeling for generation tasks. Our lattice representation\ncould be effectively encoded using a graph model, that uses significantly fewer\nmodel parameters (13.5 times lesser) than existing state-of-the-art.

    "title": "Robust Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Greenhouse  Control",
    "abstract": "Due to the high efficiency and less weather dependency, autonomous\ngreenhouses provide an ideal solution to meet the increasing demand for fresh\nfood. However, managers are faced with some challenges in finding appropriate\ncontrol strategies for crop growth, since the decision space of the greenhouse\ncontrol problem is an astronomical number. Therefore, an intelligent\nclosed-loop control framework is highly desired to generate an automatic\ncontrol policy. As a powerful tool for optimal control, reinforcement learning\n(RL) algorithms can surpass human beings' decision-making and can also be\nseamlessly integrated into the closed-loop control framework. However, in\ncomplex real-world scenarios such as agricultural automation control, where the\ninteraction with the environment is time-consuming and expensive, the\napplication of RL algorithms encounters two main challenges, i.e., sample\nefficiency and safety. Although model-based RL methods can greatly mitigate the\nefficiency problem of greenhouse control, the safety problem has not got too\nmuch attention. In this paper, we present a model-based robust RL framework for\nautonomous greenhouse control to meet the sample efficiency and safety\nchallenges. Specifically, our framework introduces an ensemble of environment\nmodels to work as a simulator and assist in policy optimization, thereby\naddressing the low sample efficiency problem. As for the safety concern, we\npropose a sample dropout module to focus more on worst-case samples, which can\nhelp improve the adaptability of the greenhouse planting policy in extreme\ncases. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can learn a more\neffective greenhouse planting policy with better robustness than existing\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "DFT is the numerical implementation of Fourier transform (FT), and it has\nmany forms. Ordinary DFT (ODFT) and symmetric DFT (SDFT) are the two main forms\nof DFT. The most widely used DFT is ODFT, and the phase spectrum of this form\nis widely used in engineering applications. However, it is found ODFT has the\nproblem of phase aliasing. Moreover, ODFT does not have many FT properties,\nsuch as symmetry, integration, and interpolation. When compared with ODFT, SDFT\nhas more FT properties. Theoretically, the more properties a transformation\nhas, the wider its application range. Hence, SDFT is more suitable as the\ndiscrete form of FT. In order to promote SDFT, the unique nature of SDFT is\ndemonstrated. The time-domain of even-point SDFT is not symmetric to zero, and\nthe author corrects it in this study. The author raises a new issue that should\nthe signal length be odd or even when performing SDFT. The answer is odd.\nHowever, scientists and engineers are accustomed to using even-numbered\nsequences. At the end of this study, the reasons why the author advocates odd\nSDFT are given.

However, the factors affecting its success are still largely\nunexplained. In this work, we develop a first-order linear model of adversarial\nreprogramming to show that its success inherently depends on the size of the\naverage input gradient, which grows when input gradients are more aligned, and\nwhen inputs have higher dimensionality.

Few-shot\nSemantic Segmentation (FSS) is a promising strategy for breaking the deadlock.\nHowever, a high-performing FSS model still requires sufficient pixel-level\nannotated classes for training to avoid overfitting, which leads to its\nperformance bottleneck in medical image segmentation due to the unmet need for\nannotations. Thus, semi-supervised FSS for medical images is accordingly\nproposed to utilize unlabeled data for further performance improvement.\nNevertheless, existing semi-supervised FSS methods has two obvious defects: (1)\nneglecting the relationship between the labeled and unlabeled data; (2) using\nunlabeled data directly for end-to-end training leads to degenerated\nrepresentation learning. To address these problems, we propose a novel\nsemi-supervised FSS framework for medical image segmentation. The proposed\nframework employs Poisson learning for modeling data relationship and\npropagating supervision signals, and Spatial Consistency Calibration for\nencouraging the model to learn more coherent representations. In this process,\nunlabeled samples do not involve in end-to-end training, but provide\nsupervisory information for query image segmentation through graph-based\nlearning.

Even though densification increases the capacity of\nthe network, it also leads to increased energy consumption which can be curbed\nby dynamically switching off some base stations (BSs) during periods of low\ntraffic. However, dynamic cell switching has the challenge of spectrum\nunder-utilizationas the spectrum originally occupied by the BSs that are turned\noff remains dormant.

In this paper, we propose a multi-intent NLU framework, called SLIM,\nto jointly learn multi-intent detection and slot filling based on BERT. To\nfully exploit the existing annotation data and capture the interactions between\nslots and intents, SLIM introduces an explicit slot-intent classifier to learn\nthe many-to-one mapping between slots and intents.

Recent methods have tried to\naddress this problem either by using reinforcement learning, which is difficult\nto train, or by uncertainty maps, which are task-specific and can only be\nimplemented for dense prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose the\nGlimpse-Attend-and-Explore model which: (a) employs self-attention to guide the\nvisual exploration instead of task-specific uncertainty maps; (b) can be used\nfor both dense and sparse prediction tasks; and (c) uses a contrastive stream\nto further improve the representations learned.

    "abstract": "Domain generalization (DG) aims to generalize a model trained on multiple\nsource (i.e., training) domains to a distributionally different target (i.e.,\ntest) domain. In contrast to the conventional DG that strictly requires the\navailability of multiple source domains, this paper considers a more realistic\nyet challenging scenario, namely Single Domain Generalization (Single-DG),\nwhere only one source domain is available for training. In this scenario, the\nlimited diversity may jeopardize the model generalization on unseen target\ndomains. To tackle this problem, we propose a style-complement module to\nenhance the generalization power of the model by synthesizing images from\ndiverse distributions that are complementary to the source ones. More\nspecifically, we adopt a tractable upper bound of mutual information (MI)\nbetween the generated and source samples and perform a two-step optimization\niteratively: (1) by minimizing the MI upper bound approximation for each sample\npair, the generated images are forced to be diversified from the source\nsamples; (2) subsequently, we maximize the MI between the samples from the same\nsemantic category, which assists the network to learn discriminative features\nfrom diverse-styled images. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of our approach, which surpasses the\nstate-of-the-art single-DG methods by up to 25.14%.",

To\naddress this problem, we label and establish the first underwater semantic\nsegmentation dataset of real scene(DUT-USEG:DUT Underwater Segmentation\nDataset). The DUT- USEG dataset includes 6617 images, 1487 of which have\nsemantic segmentation and instance segmentation annotations, and the remaining\n5130 images have object detection box annotations. Based on this dataset, we\npropose a semi-supervised underwater semantic segmentation network focusing on\nthe boundaries(US-Net: Underwater Segmentation Network). By designing a pseudo\nlabel generator and a boundary detection subnetwork, this network realizes the\nfine learning of boundaries between underwater objects and background, and\nimproves the segmentation effect of boundary areas. Experiments show that the\nproposed method improves by 6.7% in three categories of holothurian, echinus,\nstarfish in DUT-USEG dataset, and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Previous methods are limited in reasoning on a\npredefined graph, which ignores the inherent person-specific interaction\ncontext. Moreover, they adopt inference schemes that are computationally\nexpensive and easily result in the over-smoothing problem. In this paper, we\nmanage to achieve spatio-temporal person-specific inferences by proposing\nDynamic Inference Network (DIN), which composes of Dynamic Relation (DR) module\nand Dynamic Walk (DW) module. We firstly propose to initialize interaction\nfields on a primary spatio-temporal graph.

By updating features on the specific graph, a person can\npossess a global-level interaction field with a local initialization.\nExperiments indicate both modules' effectiveness.

    "title": "Disentangling What and Where for 3D Object-Centric Representations  Through Active Inference",
    "abstract": "Although modern object detection and classification models achieve high\naccuracy, these are typically constrained in advance on a fixed train set and\nare therefore not flexible to deal with novel, unseen object categories.\nMoreover, these models most often operate on a single frame, which may yield\nincorrect classifications in case of ambiguous viewpoints. In this paper, we\npropose an active inference agent that actively gathers evidence for object\nclassifications, and can learn novel object categories over time. Drawing\ninspiration from the human brain, we build object-centric generative models\ncomposed of two information streams, a what- and a where-stream. The\nwhat-stream predicts whether the observed object belongs to a specific\ncategory, while the where-stream is responsible for representing the object in\nits internal 3D reference frame. We show that our agent (i) is able to learn\nrepresentations for many object categories in an unsupervised way, (ii)\nachieves state-of-the-art classification accuracies, actively resolving\nambiguity when required and (iii) identifies novel object categories.\nFurthermore, we validate our system in an end-to-end fashion where the agent is\nable to search for an object at a given pose from a pixel-based rendering. We\nbelieve that this is a first step towards building modular, intelligent systems\nthat can be used for a wide range of tasks involving three dimensional objects.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks, especially convolutional deep neural networks, are\nstate-of-the-art methods to classify, segment or even generate images, movies,\nor sounds. However, these methods lack of a good semantic understanding of what\nhappens internally. The question, why a COVID-19 detector has classified a\nstack of lung-ct images as positive, is sometimes more interesting than the\noverall specificity and sensitivity. Especially when human domain expert\nknowledge disagrees with the given output. This way, human domain experts could\nalso be advised to reconsider their choice, regarding the information pointed\nout by the system. In addition, the deep learning model can be controlled, and\na present dataset bias can be found. Currently, most explainable AI methods in\nthe computer vision domain are purely used on image classification, where the\nimages are ordinary images in the visible spectrum. As a result, there is no\ncomparison on how the methods behave with multimodal image data, as well as\nmost methods have not been investigated on how they behave when used for object\ndetection. This work tries to close the gaps. Firstly, investigating three\nsaliency map generator methods on how their maps differ across the different\nspectra. This is achieved via accurate and systematic training. Secondly, we\nexamine how they behave when used for object detection. As a practical problem,\nwe chose object detection in the infrared and visual spectrum for autonomous\ndriving. The dataset used in this work is the Multispectral Object Detection\nDataset, where each scene is available in the FIR, MIR and NIR as well as\nvisual spectrum. The results show that there are differences between the\ninfrared and visual activation maps. Further, an advanced training with both,\nthe infrared and visual data not only improves the network's output, it also\nleads to more focused spots in the saliency maps.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of Byzantine fault-tolerance in federated machine\nlearning. In this problem, the system comprises multiple agents each with local\ndata, and a trusted centralized coordinator. In fault-free setting, the agents\ncollaborate with the coordinator to find a minimizer of the aggregate of their\nlocal cost functions defined over their local data. We consider a scenario\nwhere some agents ($f$ out of $N$) are Byzantine faulty. Such agents need not\nfollow a prescribed algorithm correctly, and may communicate arbitrary\nincorrect information to the coordinator. In the presence of Byzantine agents,\na more reasonable goal for the non-faulty agents is to find a minimizer of the\naggregate cost function of only the non-faulty agents. This particular goal is\ncommonly referred as exact fault-tolerance. Recent work has shown that exact\nfault-tolerance is achievable if only if the non-faulty agents satisfy the\nproperty of $2f$-redundancy. Now, under this property, techniques are known to\nimpart exact fault-tolerance to the distributed implementation of the classical\nstochastic gradient-descent (SGD) algorithm. However, we do not know of any\nsuch techniques for the federated local SGD algorithm - a more commonly used\nmethod for federated machine learning. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel technique named comparative elimination (CE). We show that, under\n$2f$-redundancy, the federated local SGD algorithm with CE can indeed obtain\nexact fault-tolerance in the deterministic setting when the non-faulty agents\ncan accurately compute gradients of their local cost functions. In the general\nstochastic case, when agents can only compute unbiased noisy estimates of their\nlocal gradients, our algorithm achieves approximate fault-tolerance with\napproximation error proportional to the variance of stochastic gradients and\nthe fraction of Byzantine agents.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous highlight detection is crucial for enhancing the efficiency of\nvideo browsing on social media platforms. To attain this goal in a data-driven\nway, one may often face the situation where highlight annotations are not\navailable on the target video category used in practice, while the supervision\non another video category (named as source video category) is achievable. In\nsuch a situation, one can derive an effective highlight detector on target\nvideo category by transferring the highlight knowledge acquired from source\nvideo category to the target one. We call this problem cross-category video\nhighlight detection, which has been rarely studied in previous works. For\ntackling such practical problem, we propose a Dual-Learner-based Video\nHighlight Detection (DL-VHD) framework. Under this framework, we first design a\nSet-based Learning module (SL-module) to improve the conventional pair-based\nlearning by assessing the highlight extent of a video segment under a broader\ncontext. Based on such learning manner, we introduce two different learners to\nacquire the basic distinction of target category videos and the characteristics\nof highlight moments on source video category, respectively. These two types of\nhighlight knowledge are further consolidated via knowledge distillation.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority\nof the proposed SL-module, and the DL-VHD method outperforms five typical\nUnsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) algorithms on various cross-category\nhighlight detection tasks.

Unlike\nnormalising flow models which use invertible neural network structures to\nrepresent these diffeomorphisms, we develop them from gradient information of\ndesired costs, and encode desirable behaviour, such as obstacle avoidance.\nThese transformed sampling distributions can then be used for sampling-based\nmotion planning. A particular example is when we wish to imbue the sampling\ndistribution with knowledge of the environment geometry, such that drawn\nsamples are less prone to be in collisions. To this end, we propose to learn a\ncontinuous occupancy representation from environment occupancy data, such that\ngradients of the representation defines a valid diffeomorphism and is amenable\nto fast parallel evaluation. We use this to \"morph\" the sampling distribution\nto draw far fewer collision-prone samples. PDMP is able to leverage gradient\ninformation of costs, to inject specifications, in a manner similar to\noptimisation-based motion planning methods, but relies on drawing from a\nsampling distribution, retaining the tendency to find more global solutions,\nthereby bridging the gap between trajectory optimisation and sampling-based\nplanning methods.",

    "title": "Efficient Out-of-Distribution Detection Using Latent Space of  $\u03b2$-VAE for Cyber-Physical Systems",
    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks are actively being used in the design of autonomous\nCyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). The advantage of these models is their ability\nto handle high-dimensional state-space and learn compact surrogate\nrepresentations of the operational state spaces. However, the problem is that\nthe sampled observations used for training the model may never cover the entire\nstate space of the physical environment, and as a result, the system will\nlikely operate in conditions that do not belong to the training distribution.\nThese conditions that do not belong to training distribution are referred to as\nOut-of-Distribution (OOD). Detecting OOD conditions at runtime is critical for\nthe safety of CPS. In addition, it is also desirable to identify the context or\nthe feature(s) that are the source of OOD to select an appropriate control\naction to mitigate the consequences that may arise because of the OOD\ncondition. In this paper, we study this problem as a multi-labeled time series\nOOD detection problem over images, where the OOD is defined both sequentially\nacross short time windows (change points) as well as across the training data\ndistribution. A common approach to solving this problem is the use of\nmulti-chained one-class classifiers. However, this approach is expensive for\nCPSs that have limited computational resources and require short inference\ntimes. Our contribution is an approach to design and train a single\n$\\beta$-Variational Autoencoder detector with a partially disentangled latent\nspace sensitive to variations in image features. We use the feature sensitive\nlatent variables in the latent space to detect OOD images and identify the most\nlikely feature(s) responsible for the OOD. We demonstrate our approach using an\nAutonomous Vehicle in the CARLA simulator and a real-world automotive dataset\ncalled nuImages.",

    "abstract": "The fine-grained localization of clinicians in the operating room (OR) is a\nkey component to design the new generation of OR support systems. Computer\nvision models for person pixel-based segmentation and body-keypoints detection\nare needed to better understand the clinical activities and the spatial layout\nof the OR. This is challenging, not only because OR images are very different\nfrom traditional vision datasets, but also because data and annotations are\nhard to collect and generate in the OR due to privacy concerns. To address\nthese concerns, we first study how joint person pose estimation and instance\nsegmentation can be performed on low resolutions images from 1x to 12x. Second,\nto address the domain shift and the lack of annotations, we propose a novel\nunsupervised domain adaptation method, called \\emph{AdaptOR}, to adapt a model\nfrom an \\emph{in-the-wild} labeled source domain to a statistically different\nunlabeled target domain. We propose to exploit explicit geometric constraints\non the different augmentations of the unlabeled target domain image to generate\naccurate pseudo labels, and using these pseudo labels to train the model on\nhigh- and low-resolution OR images in a \\emph{self-training} framework.\nFurthermore, we propose \\emph{disentangled feature normalization} to handle the\nstatistically different source and target domain data. Extensive experimental\nresults with detailed ablation studies on the two OR datasets \\emph{MVOR+} and\n\\emph{TUM-OR-test} show the effectiveness of our approach against strongly\nconstructed baselines, especially on the low-resolution privacy-preserving OR\nimages. Finally, we show the generality of our method as a semi-supervised\nlearning (SSL) method on the large-scale \\emph{COCO} dataset, where we achieve\ncomparable results with as few as \\textbf{1\\%} of labeled supervision against a\nmodel trained with 100\\% labeled supervision.",

    "abstract": "The massive growth of digital biomedical data is making biomedical text\nindexing and classification increasingly important. Accordingly, previous\nresearch has devised numerous techniques ranging from rule-based systems to\ndeep neural networks, with most focusing on feedforward, convolutional or\nrecurrent neural architectures.

    "abstract": "Theory-of-mind (ToM), a human ability to infer the intentions and thoughts of\nothers, is an essential part of empathetic experiences. We provide here the\nframework for using NLP models to measure ToM expressed in written texts. For\nthis purpose, we introduce ToM-Diary, a crowdsourced 18,238 diaries with 74,014\nKorean sentences annotated with different ToM levels. Each diary was annotated\nwith ToM levels by trained psychology students and reviewed by selected\npsychology experts. The annotators first divided the diaries based on whether\nthey mentioned other people: self-focused and other-focused. Examples of\nself-focused sentences are \"I am feeling good\". The other-focused sentences\nwere further classified into different levels. These levels differ by whether\nthe writer 1) mentions the presence of others without inferring their mental\nstate(e.g., I saw a man walking down the street), 2) fails to take the\nperspective of others (e.g., I don't understand why they refuse to wear masks),\nor 3) successfully takes the perspective of others (It must have been hard for\nthem to continue working). We tested whether state-of-the-art transformer-based\nmodels (e.g., BERT) could predict underlying ToM levels in sentences. We found\nthat BERT more successfully detected self-focused sentences than other-focused\nones. Sentences that successfully take the perspective of others (the highest\nToM level) were the most difficult to predict.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the context aggregation problem in semantic image\nsegmentation. The existing researches focus on improving the pixel\nrepresentations by aggregating the contextual information within individual\nimages. Though impressive, these methods neglect the significance of the\nrepresentations of the pixels of the corresponding class beyond the input\nimage. To address this, this paper proposes to mine the contextual information\nbeyond individual images to further augment the pixel representations. We first\nset up a feature memory module, which is updated dynamically during training,\nto store the dataset-level representations of various categories. Then, we\nlearn class probability distribution of each pixel representation under the\nsupervision of the ground-truth segmentation. At last, the representation of\neach pixel is augmented by aggregating the dataset-level representations based\non the corresponding class probability distribution. Furthermore, by utilizing\nthe stored dataset-level representations, we also propose a representation\nconsistent learning strategy to make the classification head better address\nintra-class compactness and inter-class dispersion. The proposed method could\nbe effortlessly incorporated into existing segmentation frameworks (e.g., FCN,\nPSPNet, OCRNet and DeepLabV3) and brings consistent performance improvements.\nMining contextual information beyond image allows us to report state-of-the-art\nperformance on various benchmarks: ADE20K, LIP, Cityscapes and COCO-Stuff.",

    "title": "Alleviating Exposure Bias via Contrastive Learning for Abstractive Text  Summarization",
    "abstract": "Encoder-decoder models have achieved remarkable success in abstractive text\nsummarization, which aims to compress one or more documents into a shorter\nversion without the loss of the essential content. Unfortunately, these models\nmostly suffer a discrepancy between training and inference, i.e., the exposure\nbias problem. During the training stage, with teacher forcing these models are\noptimized to maximize the likelihood of the gold summary given the gold summary\ntokens as input to the decoder, while at inference the given tokens are\nreplaced by the generated tokens. Consequently, low-quality summaries are very\nlikely to be generated. To remedy this problem, we propose to leverage\ncontrastive learning to decrease the likelihood of these low-quality summaries,\nand meanwhile increase the likelihood of the gold summary. Since our solution\nexpands the states that the model perceives during training, we expect that the\nexposure bias problem can be alleviated. We experimentally demonstrate that our\nmethod effectively improves the performance of the state-of-the-art model on\ndifferent datasets.",

    "abstract": "Despite impressive results of language models for named entity recognition\n(NER), their generalization to varied textual genres, a growing entity type\nset, and new entities remains a challenge. Collecting thousands of annotations\nin each new case for training or fine-tuning is expensive and time-consuming.\nIn contrast, humans can easily identify named entities given some simple\ninstructions. Inspired by this, we challenge the reliance on large datasets and\nstudy pre-trained language models for NER in a meta-learning setup. First, we\ntest named entity typing (NET) in a zero-shot transfer scenario. Then, we\nperform NER by giving few examples at inference. We propose a method to select\nseen and rare / unseen names when having access only to the pre-trained model\nand report results on these groups. The results show: auto-regressive language\nmodels as meta-learners can perform NET and NER fairly well especially for\nregular or seen names; name irregularity when often present for a certain\nentity type can become an effective exploitable cue; names with words foreign\nto the model have the most negative impact on results; the model seems to rely\nmore on name than context cues in few-shot NER.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models are modern tools for spatio-temporal graph (STG)\nforecasting. Despite their effectiveness, they require large-scale datasets to\nachieve better performance and are vulnerable to noise perturbation. To\nalleviate these limitations, an intuitive idea is to use the popular data\naugmentation and contrastive learning techniques. However, existing graph\ncontrastive learning methods cannot be directly applied to STG forecasting due\nto three reasons. First, we empirically discover that the forecasting task is\nunable to benefit from the pretrained representations derived from contrastive\nlearning. Second, data augmentations that are used for defeating noise are less\nexplored for STG data. Third, the semantic similarity of samples has been\noverlooked. In this paper, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Graph Contrastive\nLearning framework (STGCL) to tackle these issues. Specifically, we improve the\nperformance by integrating the forecasting loss with an auxiliary contrastive\nloss rather than using a pretrained paradigm. We elaborate on four types of\ndata augmentations, which disturb data in terms of graph structure, time\ndomain, and frequency domain. We also extend the classic contrastive loss\nthrough a rule-based strategy that filters out the most semantically similar\nnegatives. Our framework is evaluated across three real-world datasets and four\nstate-of-the-art models. The consistent improvements demonstrate that STGCL can\nbe used as an off-the-shelf plug-in for existing deep models.",

The SQL-based training data\ndebugging framework has proved effective to fix this kind of issue in a\nnon-federated learning setting. Given an unexpected query result over model\npredictions, this framework automatically removes the label errors from\ntraining data such that the unexpected behavior disappears in the retrained\nmodel. In this paper, we enable this powerful framework for federated learning.\nThe key challenge is how to develop a security protocol for federated debugging\nwhich is proved to be secure, efficient, and accurate. Achieving this goal\nrequires us to investigate how to seamlessly integrate the techniques from\nmultiple fields (Databases, Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity). We first\npropose FedRain, which extends Rain, the state-of-the-art SQL-based training\ndata debugging framework, to our federated learning setting. We address several\ntechnical challenges to make FedRain work and analyze its security guarantee\nand time complexity. The analysis results show that FedRain falls short in\nterms of both efficiency and security. To overcome these limitations, we\nredesign our security protocol and propose Frog, a novel SQL-based training\ndata debugging framework tailored for federated learning.

    "abstract": "There has been much interest in deploying deep learning algorithms on\nlow-powered devices, including smartphones, drones, and medical sensors.\nHowever, full-scale deep neural networks are often too resource-intensive in\nterms of energy and storage. As a result, the bulk part of the machine learning\noperation is therefore often carried out on an edge server, where the data is\ncompressed and transmitted. However, compressing data (such as images) leads to\ntransmitting information irrelevant to the supervised task. Another popular\napproach is to split the deep network between the device and the server while\ncompressing intermediate features. To date, however, such split computing\nstrategies have barely outperformed the aforementioned naive data compression\nbaselines due to their inefficient approaches to feature compression. This\npaper adopts ideas from knowledge distillation and neural image compression to\ncompress intermediate feature representations more efficiently. Our supervised\ncompression approach uses a teacher model and a student model with a stochastic\nbottleneck and learnable prior for entropy coding. We compare our approach to\nvarious neural image and feature compression baselines in three vision tasks\nand found that it achieves better supervised rate-distortion performance while\nalso maintaining smaller end-to-end latency. We furthermore show that the\nlearned feature representations can be tuned to serve multiple downstream\ntasks.",

Method: To this end,\nwe conducted a multiple-case study exploring the design thinking and creativity\nof co-located and distributed software developers in a collaborative design\nsetting. Results: Compared to co-located developers, distributed developers\nspend less time on exploring the problem space, which could be related to\ndifferent socio-technical challenges, such as lack of awareness and common\nunderstanding.

    "abstract": "Stylized image captioning systems aim to generate a caption not only\nsemantically related to a given image but also consistent with a given style\ndescription. One of the biggest challenges with this task is the lack of\nsufficient paired stylized data. Many studies focus on unsupervised approaches,\nwithout considering from the perspective of data augmentation. We begin with\nthe observation that people may recall similar emotions when they are in\nsimilar scenes, and often express similar emotions with similar style phrases,\nwhich underpins our data augmentation idea. In this paper, we propose a novel\nExtract-Retrieve-Generate data augmentation framework to extract style phrases\nfrom small-scale stylized sentences and graft them to large-scale factual\ncaptions. First, we design the emotional signal extractor to extract style\nphrases from small-scale stylized sentences. Second, we construct the plugable\nmulti-modal scene retriever to retrieve scenes represented with pairs of an\nimage and its stylized caption, which are similar to the query image or caption\nin the large-scale factual data. In the end, based on the style phrases of\nsimilar scenes and the factual description of the current scene, we build the\nemotion-aware caption generator to generate fluent and diversified stylized\ncaptions for the current scene. Extensive experimental results show that our\nframework can alleviate the data scarcity problem effectively. It also\nsignificantly boosts the performance of several existing image captioning\nmodels in both supervised and unsupervised settings, which outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art stylized image captioning methods in terms of both sentence\nrelevance and stylishness by a substantial margin.",

They offer an attractive representation for\nmany data-sparse dense operators that appear in practical applications, where\nsubstantial compression and a much smaller memory footprint can be achieved.\nTLR matrices are a compromise between the simplicity of a regular\nperfectly-strided data structure and the optimal complexity of the unbalanced\ntrees of hierarchically low rank matrices, and provide a convenient\nperformance-tuning parameter through their tile size that can be proportioned\nto take into account the cache size where the tiles reside in the memory\nhierarchy.\nThere are currently no high-performance algorithms that can generate Cholesky\nand $LDL^T$ factorizations, particularly on GPUs.

These unrealistic\ngoals will result in an extremely narrow range of model capabilities, greatly\nlimiting their use in real applications. To overcome these drawbacks, we\nre-design the benchmarks and propose the semantically coherent\nout-of-distribution detection (SC-OOD).

Although this is an inherently ambiguous problem, the majority of\nrecent works avoid the uncertainty modeling and typically regress a single\nestimate for a given input. In contrast to that, in this work, we propose to\nembrace the reconstruction ambiguity and we recast the problem as learning a\nmapping from the input to a distribution of plausible 3D poses. Our approach is\nbased on the normalizing flows model and offers a series of advantages. For\nconventional applications, where a single 3D estimate is required, our\nformulation allows for efficient mode computation. Using the mode leads to\nperformance that is comparable with the state of the art among deterministic\nunimodal regression models.

Existing\nend-to-end learning-based VLN methods struggle at this task as they focus\nmostly on utilizing raw visual observations and lack the semantic\nspatio-temporal reasoning capabilities which is crucial in generalizing to new\nenvironments. In this regard, we present a hybrid transformer-recurrence model\nwhich focuses on combining classical semantic mapping techniques with a\nlearning-based method. Our method creates a temporal semantic memory by\nbuilding a top-down local ego-centric semantic map and performs cross-modal\ngrounding to align map and language modalities to enable effective learning of\nVLN policy. Empirical results in a photo-realistic long-horizon simulation\nenvironment show that the proposed approach outperforms a variety of\nstate-of-the-art methods and baselines with over 22% relative improvement in\nSPL in prior unseen environments.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in text representation have shown that training on large\namounts of text is crucial for natural language understanding. However, models\ntrained without predefined notions of topical interest typically require\ncareful fine-tuning when transferred to specialized domains. When a sufficient\namount of within-domain text may not be available, expanding a seed corpus of\nrelevant documents from large-scale web data poses several challenges. First,\ncorpus expansion requires scoring and ranking each document in the collection,\nan operation that can quickly become computationally expensive as the web\ncorpora size grows. Relying on dense vector spaces and pairwise similarity adds\nto the computational expense. Secondly, as the domain concept becomes more\nnuanced, capturing the long tail of domain-specific rare terms becomes\nnon-trivial, especially under limited seed corpora scenarios.\nIn this paper, we consider the problem of fast approximate corpus expansion\ngiven a small seed corpus with a few relevant documents as a query, with the\ngoal of capturing the long tail of a domain-specific set of concept terms. To\nefficiently collect large-scale domain-specific corpora with limited relevance\nfeedback, we propose a novel truncated sparse document bit-vector\nrepresentation, termed Signature Assisted Unsupervised Corpus Expansion\n(SAUCE). Experimental results show that SAUCE can reduce the computational\nburden while ensuring high within-domain lexical coverage.",

Furthermore, we introduce a\nBenchmark for AMR Metrics based on Overt Objectives (BAMBOO), the first\nbenchmark to support empirical assessment of graph-based MR similarity metrics.\nBAMBOO maximizes the interpretability of results by defining multiple overt\nobjectives that range from sentence similarity objectives to stress tests that\nprobe a metric's robustness against meaning-altering and meaning-preserving\ngraph transformations.

In this work, we put forth a\nphysics-informed deep learning framework that augments sparse clinical\nmeasurements with fast computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to\ngenerate physically consistent and high spatiotemporal resolution of brain\nhemodynamic parameters. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound is one of the\nmost common techniques in the current clinical workflow that enables\nnoninvasive and instantaneous evaluation of blood flow velocity within the\ncerebral arteries. However, it is spatially limited to only a handful of\nlocations across the cerebrovasculature due to the constrained accessibility\nthrough the skull's acoustic windows. Our deep learning framework employs\nin-vivo real-time TCD velocity measurements at several locations in the brain\nand the baseline vessel cross-sectional areas acquired from 3D angiography\nimages, and provides high-resolution maps of velocity, area, and pressure in\nthe entire vasculature. We validated the predictions of our model against\nin-vivo velocity measurements obtained via 4D flow MRI scans. We then showcased\nthe clinical significance of this technique in diagnosing the cerebral\nvasospasm (CVS) by successfully predicting the changes in vasospastic local\nvessel diameters based on corresponding sparse velocities measurements. The key\nfinding here is that the combined effects of uncertainties in outlet boundary\ncondition subscription and modeling physics deficiencies render the\nconventional purely physics-based computational models unsuccessful in\nrecovering accurate brain hemodynamics. Nonetheless, fusing these models with\nclinical measurements through a data-driven approach ameliorates predictions of\nbrain hemodynamic variables.",

Specifically, the framework\nconsists of two main parts, the three-dimensional feature learning path and the\ntwo-dimensional segmentation path. In the three-dimensional feature learning\npath, we design a novel Adaptive Pooling Module (APM) and propose a new\nQuadruple Attention Module (QAM). The APM captures dependencies along the\nprojection direction of volumes and learns a series of pooling coefficients for\nfeature fusion, which efficiently reduces feature dimension. In addition, the\nQAM reweights the features by capturing four-group cross-dimension\ndependencies, which makes maximum use of 4D feature tensors. In the\ntwo-dimensional segmentation path, to acquire more detailed information, we\npropose a Feature Fusion Module (FFM) to inject 3D information into the 2D\npath. Meanwhile, we adopt the Polarized Self-Attention (PSA) block to model the\nsemantic interdependencies in spatial and channel dimensions respectively.\nExperimentally, our extensive experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset show that our\nproposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with previous\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Recently, convergence as well as convergence rate analyses of deep learning\noptimizers for nonconvex optimization have been widely studied. Meanwhile,\nnumerical evaluations for the optimizers have precisely clarified the\nrelationship between batch size and the number of steps needed for training\ndeep neural networks. The main contribution of this paper is to show\ntheoretically that the number of steps needed for nonconvex optimization of\neach of the optimizers can be expressed as a rational function of batch size.\nHaving these rational functions leads to two particularly important facts,\nwhich were validated numerically in previous studies. The first fact is that\nthere exists an optimal batch size such that the number of steps needed for\nnonconvex optimization is minimized. This implies that using larger batch sizes\nthan the optimal batch size does not decrease the number of steps needed for\nnonconvex optimization. The second fact is that the optimal batch size depends\non the optimizer. In particular, it is shown theoretically that momentum and\nAdam-type optimizers can exploit larger optimal batches and further reduce the\nminimum number of steps needed for nonconvex optimization than can the\nstochastic gradient descent optimizer.",

As this technology advances, it is becoming\nincreasingly useful also in society. In fact, continued urbanization is\noverwhelming existing pedestrian infrastructures such as transportation hubs\nand stations, generating an urgent need for real-time highly-accurate usage\ndata, aiming both at flow monitoring and dynamics understanding. To\nsuccessfully employ pedestrian tracking techniques in research and technology,\nit is crucial to validate and benchmark them for accuracy. This is not only\nnecessary to guarantee data quality, but also to identify systematic errors.\nIn this contribution, we present and discuss a benchmark suite, towards an\nopen standard in the community, for privacy-respectful pedestrian tracking\ntechniques. The suite is technology-independent and is applicable to academic\nand commercial pedestrian tracking systems, operating both in lab environments\nand real-life conditions. The benchmark suite consists of 5 tests addressing\nspecific aspects of pedestrian tracking quality, including accurate crowd flux\nestimation, density estimation, position detection and trajectory accuracy. The\noutput of the tests are quality factors expressed as single numbers. We provide\nthe benchmark results for two tracking systems, both operating in real-life,\none commercial, and the other based on overhead depth-maps developed at TU\nEindhoven.

    "abstract": "Automatic segmentation of shoulder muscle MRI is challenging due to the high\nvariation in muscle size, shape, texture, and spatial position of tears. Manual\nsegmentation of tear and muscle portion is hard, time-consuming, and subjective\nto pathological expertise. This work proposes a new Region and Edge-based Deep\nAuto-Encoder (RE-DAE) for shoulder muscle MRI segmentation. The proposed RE-DAE\nharmoniously employs average and max-pooling operation in the encoder and\ndecoder blocks of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Region-based\nsegmentation incorporated in the Deep Auto-Encoder (DAE) encourages the network\nto extract smooth and homogenous regions. In contrast, edge-based segmentation\ntries to learn the boundary and anatomical information. These two concepts,\nsystematically combined in a DAE, generate a discriminative and sparse hybrid\nfeature space (exploiting both region homogeneity and boundaries). Moreover,\nthe concept of static attention is exploited in the proposed RE-DAE that helps\nin effectively learning the tear region. The performances of the proposed MRI\nsegmentation based DAE architectures have been tested using a 3D MRI shoulder\nmuscle dataset using the hold-out cross-validation technique. The MRI data has\nbeen collected from the Korea University Anam Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.\nExperimental comparisons have been conducted by employing innovative\ncustom-made and existing pre-trained CNN architectures both using transfer\nlearning and fine-tuning. Objective evaluation on the muscle datasets using the\nproposed SA-RE-DAE showed a dice similarity of 85.58% and 87.07%, an accuracy\nof 81.57% and 95.58% for tear and muscle regions, respectively. The high visual\nquality and the objective result suggest that the proposed SA-RE-DAE is able to\ncorrectly segment tear and muscle regions in shoulder muscle MRI for better\nclinical decisions.",

    "abstract": "Nonsmooth optimization problems arising in practice tend to exhibit\nbeneficial smooth substructure: their domains stratify into \"active manifolds\"\nof smooth variation, which common proximal algorithms \"identify\" in finite\ntime. Identification then entails a transition to smooth dynamics, and\naccommodates second-order acceleration techniques. While identification is\nclearly useful algorithmically, empirical evidence suggests that even those\nalgorithms that do not identify the active manifold in finite time -- notably\nthe subgradient method -- are nonetheless affected by it. This work seeks to\nexplain this phenomenon, asking: how do active manifolds impact the subgradient\nmethod in nonsmooth optimization?\nIn this work, we answer this question by introducing two algorithmically\nuseful properties -- aiming and subgradient approximation -- that fully expose\nthe smooth substructure of the problem. We show that these properties imply\nthat the shadow of the (stochastic) subgradient method along the active\nmanifold is precisely an inexact Riemannian gradient method with an implicit\nretraction. We prove that these properties hold for a wide class of problems,\nincluding cone reducible/decomposable functions and generic semialgebraic\nproblems. Moreover, we develop a thorough calculus, proving such properties are\npreserved under smooth deformations and spectral lifts. This viewpoint then\nleads to several algorithmic consequences that parallel results in smooth\noptimization, despite the nonsmoothness of the problem: local rates of\nconvergence, asymptotic normality, and saddle point avoidance. The asymptotic\nnormality results appear to be new even in the most classical setting of\nstochastic nonlinear programming. The results culminate in the following\nobservation: the perturbed subgradient method on generic, Clarke regular\nsemialgebraic problems, converges only to local minimizers.",

Molecular subtyping\nhas enabled precision medicine to overcome these challenges and provide\nsignificant biological insights to predict prognosis and improve clinical\ndecision making. Over the past decade, conventional ML algorithms and DL-based\nCNNs have been espoused for the classification of cancer subtypes from gene\nexpression datasets. However, these methods are potentially biased toward\nidentification of cancer biomarkers. Recently proposed transformer-based\narchitectures that leverage the self-attention mechanism encode high throughput\ngene expressions and learn representations that are computationally complex and\nparametrically expensive. However, compared to the datasets for natural\nlanguage processing applications, gene expression consists of several hundreds\nof thousands of genes from a limited number of observations, making it\ndifficult to efficiently train transformers for bioinformatics applications.\nHence, we propose an end-to-end deep learning approach, Gene Transformer, which\naddresses the complexity of high-dimensional gene expression with a multi-head\nself-attention module by identifying relevant biomarkers across multiple cancer\nsubtypes without requiring feature selection as a prerequisite for the current\nclassification algorithms.

    "abstract": "We study the cone of completely positive (cp) matrices for the first\ninteresting case $n = 5$. This is a semialgebraic set, which means that the\npolynomial equalities and inequlities that define its boundary can be derived.\nWe characterize the different loci of this boundary and we examine the two open\nsets with cp-rank 5 or 6. A numerical algorithm is presented that is fast and\nable to compute the cp-factorization even for matrices in the boundary. With\nour results, many new example cases can be produced and several insightful\nnumerical experiments are performed that illustrate the difficulty of the\ncp-factorization problem.",
