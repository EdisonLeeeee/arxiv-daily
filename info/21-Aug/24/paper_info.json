    "abstract": "A smart Ponzi scheme is a new form of economic crime that uses Ethereum smart\ncontract account and cryptocurrency to implement Ponzi scheme. The smart Ponzi\nscheme has harmed the interests of many investors, but researches on smart\nPonzi scheme detection is still very limited. The existing smart Ponzi scheme\ndetection methods have the problems of requiring many human resources in\nfeature engineering and poor model portability. To solve these problems, we\npropose a data-driven smart Ponzi scheme detection system in this paper. The\nsystem uses dynamic graph embedding technology to automatically learn the\nrepresentation of an account based on multi-source and multi-modal data related\nto account transactions. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed system\nrequires very limited human-computer interaction. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work to implement smart Ponzi scheme detection through\ndynamic graph embedding. Experimental results show that this method is\nsignificantly better than the existing smart Ponzi scheme detection methods.",

In this paper, we propose D-DARTS, a novel\nsolution that addresses this problem by nesting several neural networks at\ncell-level instead of using weight-sharing to produce more diversified and\nspecialized architectures. Moreover, we introduce a novel algorithm which can\nderive deeper architectures from a few trained cells, increasing performance\nand saving computation time.

In\norder to handle the large number of spatiotemporal tokens extracted from\nmultiple modalities, we develop several scalable model variants which factorize\nself-attention across the space, time and modality dimensions. In addition, to\nfurther explore the rich inter-modal interactions and their effects, we develop\nand compare three distinct cross-modal attention mechanisms that can be\nseamlessly integrated into the transformer building block. Extensive\nexperiments on three public action recognition benchmarks (UCF-101,\nSomething-Something-v2, Kinetics-600) demonstrate that MM-ViT outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art video transformers in both efficiency and accuracy, and\nperforms better or equally well to the state-of-the-art CNN counterparts with\ncomputationally-heavy optical flow.",

These DNNs have side branches\nthroughout their architecture, allowing the inference to end earlier in the\nedge. The branches estimate the accuracy for a given input. If this estimated\naccuracy reaches a threshold, the inference ends on the edge. Otherwise, the\nedge offloads the inference to the cloud to process the remaining DNN layers.\nHowever, DNNs for image classification deals with distorted images, which\nnegatively impact the branches' estimated accuracy. Consequently, the edge\noffloads more inferences to the cloud. This work introduces expert side\nbranches trained on a particular distortion type to improve robustness against\nimage distortion. The edge detects the distortion type and selects appropriate\nexpert branches to perform the inference. This approach increases the estimated\naccuracy on the edge, improving the offloading decisions.

    "abstract": "3D perception of object shapes from RGB image input is fundamental towards\nsemantic scene understanding, grounding image-based perception in our spatially\n3-dimensional real-world environments. To achieve a mapping between image views\nof objects and 3D shapes, we leverage CAD model priors from existing\nlarge-scale databases, and propose a novel approach towards constructing a\njoint embedding space between 2D images and 3D CAD models in a patch-wise\nfashion -- establishing correspondences between patches of an image view of an\nobject and patches of CAD geometry. This enables part similarity reasoning for\nretrieving similar CADs to a new image view without exact matches in the\ndatabase. Our patch embedding provides more robust CAD retrieval for shape\nestimation in our end-to-end estimation of CAD model shape and pose for\ndetected objects in a single input image. Experiments on in-the-wild, complex\nimagery from ScanNet show that our approach is more robust than state of the\nart in real-world scenarios without any exact CAD matches.",

    "abstract": "For the last several decades, the increased, widespread, unwarranted, and\nunaccountable use of Closed-Circuit TeleVision (CCTV) cameras globally has\nraised concerns about privacy risks. Additional recent features of many CCTV\ncameras, such as Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity and Artificial\nIntelligence (AI)-based facial recognition, only increase concerns among\nprivacy advocates. Therefore, on par \\emph{CCTV-aware solutions} must exist\nthat provide privacy, safety, and cybersecurity features. We argue that an\nimportant step forward is to develop solutions addressing privacy concerns via\nrouting and navigation systems (e.g., OpenStreetMap, Google Maps) that provide\nboth privacy and safety options for areas where cameras are known to be\npresent. However, at present no routing and navigation system, whether online\nor offline, provide corresponding CCTV-aware functionality.\nIn this paper we introduce OSRM-CCTV -- the first and only CCTV-aware routing\nand navigation system designed and built for privacy, anonymity and safety\napplications. We validate and demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of\nthe system on a handful of synthetic and real-world examples. To help validate\nour work as well as to further encourage the development and wide adoption of\nthe system, we release OSRM-CCTV as open-source.",

To address these challenges, we\npresent a disaggregated data ingestion pipeline. It includes a central data\nwarehouse built on distributed storage nodes.

    "abstract": "Specularity prediction is essential to many computer vision applications by\ngiving important visual cues that could be used in Augmented Reality (AR),\nSimultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM), 3D reconstruction and material\nmodeling, thus improving scene understanding. However, it is a challenging task\nrequiring numerous information from the scene including the camera pose, the\ngeometry of the scene, the light sources and the material properties. Our\nprevious work have addressed this task by creating an explicit model using an\nellipsoid whose projection fits the specularity image contours for a given\ncamera pose. These ellipsoid-based approaches belong to a family of models\ncalled JOint-LIght MAterial Specularity (JOLIMAS), where we have attempted to\ngradually remove assumptions on the scene such as the geometry of the specular\nsurfaces. However, our most recent approach is still limited to uniformly\ncurved surfaces. This paper builds upon these methods by generalising JOLIMAS\nto any surface geometry while improving the quality of specularity prediction,\nwithout sacrificing computation performances. The proposed method establishes a\nlink between surface curvature and specularity shape in order to lift the\ngeometric assumptions from previous work. Contrary to previous work, our new\nmodel is built from a physics-based local illumination model namely\nTorrance-Sparrow, providing a better model reconstruction. Specularity\nprediction using our new model is tested against the most recent JOLIMAS\nversion on both synthetic and real sequences with objects of varying shape\ncurvatures.

Such systems admit a symmetry, associated with the equivariance, that\nprovides structure enabling the design of robust and high performance\nobservers. A key insight is to pose the observer state to lie in the symmetry\ngroup rather than on the system state space. This allows one to define a\nglobally defined intrinsic equivariant error but poses a challenge in defining\ninternal dynamics for the observer. By choosing an equivariant lift of the\nsystem dynamics for the observer internal model we show that the error dynamics\nhave a particularly nice form. Applying the methodology of Extended Kalman\nFiltering (EKF) to the equivariant error state yields the Equivariant Filter\n(EqF). The geometry of the state-space manifold appears naturally as a\ncurvature modification to the classical EKF Riccati equation.

Despite considerable advances\nin automated tracking, these methods are still very expensive or unreliable\nwhen tracking large numbers of animals simultaneously. Moreover, this approach\nassumes that the human-chosen features include sufficient features to explain\nimportant patterns in collective behavior.

It has been rigorously proven that this algorithm will\naggregate one robot to another, but it remained open whether it would always\naggregate a system of $n > 2$ robots as was observed in experiments and\nsimulations. We prove that there exist deadlocked configurations from which\nthis algorithm cannot achieve aggregation for $n > 3$ robots when the robots'\nmotion is uniform and deterministic. On the positive side, we show that the\nalgorithm (i) is robust to small amounts of error, enabling deadlock avoidance,\nand (ii) provably achieves a linear runtime speedup for the $n = 2$ case when\nusing a cone-of-sight sensor.

    "abstract": "Society could soon see transformative artificial intelligence (TAI). Models\nof competition for TAI show firms face strong competitive pressure to deploy\nTAI systems before they are safe. This paper explores a proposed solution to\nthis problem, a Windfall Clause, where developers commit to donating a\nsignificant portion of any eventual extremely large profits to good causes.\nHowever, a key challenge for a Windfall Clause is that firms must have reason\nto join one. Firms must also believe these commitments are credible. We extend\na model of TAI competition with a Windfall Clause to show how firms and\npolicymakers can design a Windfall Clause which overcomes these challenges.\nEncouragingly, firms benefit from joining a Windfall Clause under a wide range\nof scenarios. We also find that firms join the Windfall Clause more often when\nthe competition is more dangerous. Even when firms learn each other's\ncapabilities, firms rarely wish to withdraw their support for the Windfall\nClause. These three findings strengthen the case for using a Windfall Clause to\npromote the safe development of TAI.",

However, most recent research and applications\nof federated learning assume that all clients have fully labeled data, which is\nimpractical in real-world settings. In this work, we focus on a new scenario\nfor cross-silo federated learning, where data samples of each client are\npartially labeled. We borrow ideas from semi-supervised learning methods where\na large amount of unlabeled data is utilized to improve the model's accuracy\ndespite limited access to labeled examples. We propose a new framework dubbed\nSemiFed that unifies two dominant approaches for semi-supervised learning:\nconsistency regularization and pseudo-labeling. SemiFed first applies advanced\ndata augmentation techniques to enforce consistency regularization and then\ngenerates pseudo-labels using the model's predictions during training. SemiFed\ntakes advantage of the federation so that for a given image, the pseudo-label\nholds only if multiple models from different clients produce a high-confidence\nprediction and agree on the same label.

Thus, a computation of a program in the presence of\n\\cvf{s} can be thought of as a contest where program actions attempt to take\nthe program to a legitimate state whereas \\cvf{s} could potentially this\nconvergence. We analyze three self-stabilizing programs (token ring, coloring\nand maximal matching) to evaluate this contest between program transitions and\n\\cvf{s}.

Although it provides a sub-linear regret bound,\nsuch techniques completely ignore the importance of learning with fairness\nwhich is a significant hallmark of human intelligence. (2) Online\nFairness-Aware Learning. This setting captures many classification problems for\nwhich fairness is a concern. But it aims to attain zero-shot generalization\nwithout any task-specific adaptation. This therefore limits the capability of a\nmodel to adapt onto newly arrived data. To overcome such issues and bridge the\ngap, in this paper for the first time we proposed a novel online meta-learning\nalgorithm, namely FFML, which is under the setting of unfairness prevention.\nThe key part of FFML is to learn good priors of an online fair classification\nmodel's primal and dual parameters that are associated with the model's\naccuracy and fairness, respectively. The problem is formulated in the form of a\nbi-level convex-concave optimization. Theoretic analysis provides sub-linear\nupper bounds for loss regret and for violation of cumulative fairness\nconstraints.

Therefore, we aim\nto propose a universal local discrmination framework to learn local\ndiscriminative features to effectively initialize medical models, meanwhile, we\nsystematacially investigate its practical medical applications. Specifically,\nbased on the common property of intra-modality structure similarity, i.e.\nsimilar structures are shared among the same modality images, a systematic\nlocal feature learning framework is proposed. Instead of making instance-wise\ncomparisons based on global embedding, our method makes pixel-wise embedding\nand focuses on measuring similarity among patches and regions. The finer\ncontrastive rule makes the learnt representation more generalized for\nsegmentation tasks and outperform extensive state-of-the-art methods by wining\n11 out of all 12 downstream tasks in color fundus and chest X-ray. Furthermore,\nbased on the property of inter-modality shape similarity, i.e. structures may\nshare similar shape although in different medical modalities, we joint\nacross-modality shape prior into region discrimination to realize unsupervised\nsegmentation.

    "abstract": "Voxel-based structures provide a modular, mechanically flexible periodic\nlattice which can be used as a soft robot through internal deformations. To\nengage these structures for robotic tasks, we use a finite element method to\ncharacterize the motion caused by deforming single degrees of freedom and\ndevelop a reduced kinematic model. We find that node translations propagate\nperiodically along geometric planes within the lattice, and briefly show that\ntranslational modes dominate the energy usage of the actuators. The resulting\nkinematic model frames the structural deformations in terms of user-defined\ncontrol and end effector nodes, which further reduces the model size. The\nderived Planes of Motion (POM) model can be equivalently used for forward and\ninverse kinematics, as demonstrated by the design of a tripod stable gait for a\nlocomotive voxel robot and validation of the quasi-static model through\nphysical experiments.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitous availability of computing devices and the widespread use of\nthe internet have generated a large amount of data continuously. Therefore, the\namount of available information on any given topic is far beyond humans'\nprocessing capacity to properly process, causing what is known as information\noverload. To efficiently cope with large amounts of information and generate\ncontent with significant value to users, we require identifying, merging and\nsummarising information. Data summaries can help gather related information and\ncollect it into a shorter format that enables answering complicated questions,\ngaining new insight and discovering conceptual boundaries.\nThis thesis focuses on three main challenges to alleviate information\noverload using novel summarisation techniques. It further intends to facilitate\nthe analysis of documents to support personalised information extraction. This\nthesis separates the research issues into four areas, covering (i) feature\nengineering in document summarisation, (ii) traditional static and inflexible\nsummaries, (iii) traditional generic summarisation approaches, and (iv) the\nneed for reference summaries. We propose novel approaches to tackle these\nchallenges, by: i)enabling automatic intelligent feature engineering, ii)\nenabling flexible and interactive summarisation, iii) utilising intelligent and\npersonalised summarisation approaches. The experimental results prove the\nefficiency of the proposed approaches compared to other state-of-the-art\nmodels. We further propose solutions to the information overload problem in\ndifferent domains through summarisation, covering network traffic data, health\ndata and business process data.",

    "abstract": "Existing studies on disease diagnostic models focus either on diagnostic\nmodel learning for performance improvement or on the visual explanation of a\ntrained diagnostic model. We propose a novel learn-explain-reinforce (LEAR)\nframework that unifies diagnostic model learning, visual explanation generation\n(explanation unit), and trained diagnostic model reinforcement (reinforcement\nunit) guided by the visual explanation. For the visual explanation, we generate\na counterfactual map that transforms an input sample to be identified as an\nintended target label. For example, a counterfactual map can localize\nhypothetical abnormalities within a normal brain image that may cause it to be\ndiagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We believe that the generated\ncounterfactual maps represent data-driven and model-induced knowledge about a\ntarget task, i.e., AD diagnosis using structural MRI, which can be a vital\nsource of information to reinforce the generalization of the trained diagnostic\nmodel. To this end, we devise an attention-based feature refinement module with\nthe guidance of the counterfactual maps. The explanation and reinforcement\nunits are reciprocal and can be operated iteratively. Our proposed approach was\nvalidated via qualitative and quantitative analysis on the ADNI dataset.

It\nguarantees that an adversary cannot construct a valid proof with less cost (in\nboth computation and storage) than that made by the prover in generating the\nproof.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new natural evolution strategy for unconstrained\nblack-box function optimization (BBFO) problems and implicitly constrained BBFO\nproblems. BBFO problems are known to be difficult because explicit\nrepresentations of objective functions are not available. Implicit constraints\nmake the problems more difficult because whether or not a solution is feasible\nis revealed when the solution is evaluated with the objective function.\nDX-NES-IC is one of the promising methods for implicitly constrained BBFO\nproblems. DX-NES-IC has shown better performance than conventional methods on\nimplicitly constrained benchmark problems. However, DX-NES-IC has a problem in\nthat the moving speed of the probability distribution is slow on ridge\nstructure. To address the problem, we propose the Fast Moving Natural Evolution\nStrategy (FM-NES) that accelerates the movement of the probability distribution\non ridge structure by introducing the rank-one update into DX-NES-IC. The\nrank-one update is utilized in CMA-ES. Since naively introducing the rank-one\nupdate makes the search performance deteriorate on implicitly constrained\nproblems, we propose a condition of performing the rank-one update. We also\npropose to reset the shape of the probability distribution when an infeasible\nsolution is sampled at the first time. In numerical experiments using\nunconstrained and implicitly constrained benchmark problems, FM-NES showed\nbetter performance than DX-NES-IC on problems with ridge structure and almost\nthe same performance as DX-NES-IC on the others.

Early\ndiagnosis can help in treating and even curing cancer, but the tedious,\ntime-consuming testing process makes it impossible to conduct population-wise\nscreening. To aid the pathologists in efficient and reliable detection, in this\npaper, we propose a fully automated computer-aided diagnosis tool for\nclassifying single-cell and slide images of cervical cancer. The main concern\nin developing an automatic detection tool for biomedical image classification\nis the low availability of publicly accessible data. Ensemble Learning is a\npopular approach for image classification, but simplistic approaches that\nleverage pre-determined weights to classifiers fail to perform satisfactorily.\nIn this research, we use the Sugeno Fuzzy Integral to ensemble the decision\nscores from three popular pretrained deep learning models, namely, Inception\nv3, DenseNet-161 and ResNet-34. The proposed Fuzzy fusion is capable of taking\ninto consideration the confidence scores of the classifiers for each sample,\nand thus adaptively changing the importance given to each classifier, capturing\nthe complementary information supplied by each, thus leading to superior\nclassification performance. We evaluated the proposed method on three publicly\navailable datasets, the Mendeley Liquid Based Cytology (LBC) dataset, the\nSIPaKMeD Whole Slide Image (WSI) dataset, and the SIPaKMeD Single Cell Image\n(SCI) dataset, and the results thus yielded are promising.

    "abstract": "The algorithm of Tutte for constructing convex planar straight-line drawings\nand the algorithm of Floater and Gotsman for constructing planar straight-line\nmorphs are among the most popular graph drawing algorithms. Quite surprisingly,\nlittle is known about the resolution of the drawings produced by these\nalgorithms. In this paper, focusing on maximal plane graphs, we prove tight\nbounds on the resolution of the planar straight-line drawings produced by\nFloater's algorithm, which is a broad generalization of Tutte's algorithm.\nFurther, we use such a result in order to prove a lower bound on the resolution\nof the drawings of maximal plane graphs produced by Floater and Gotsman's\nmorphing algorithm. Finally, we show that such a morphing algorithm might\nproduce drawings with exponentially-small resolution, even when transforming\ndrawings with polynomial resolution.",

    "abstract": "Human evaluation has always been expensive while researchers struggle to\ntrust the automatic metrics. To address this, we propose to customise\ntraditional metrics by taking advantages of the pre-trained language models\n(PLMs) and the limited available human labelled scores. We first re-introduce\nthe hLEPOR metric factors, followed by the Python portable version we developed\nwhich achieved the automatic tuning of the weighting parameters in hLEPOR\nmetric. Then we present the customised hLEPOR (cushLEPOR) which uses LABSE\ndistilled knowledge model to improve the metric agreement with human judgements\nby automatically optimised factor weights regarding the exact MT language pairs\nthat cushLEPOR is deployed to. We also optimise cushLEPOR towards human\nevaluation data based on MQM and pSQM framework on English-German and\nChinese-English language pairs. The experimental investigations show cushLEPOR\nboosts hLEPOR performances towards better agreements to PLMs like LABSE with\nmuch lower cost, and better agreements to human evaluations including MQM and\npSQM scores, and yields much better performances than BLEU (data available at\n\\url{https://github.com/poethan/cushLEPOR}).",

    "abstract": "This work presents a novel framework for random access in crowded scenarios\nof multiple-input multiple-output(MIMO) systems. A multi-antenna base station\n(BS) and multiple single-antenna users are considered in these systems. A huge\nportion of the system resources is dedicated as orthogonal pilots for accurate\nchannel estimation which imposes a huge training overhead. This overhead can be\nhighly mitigated by exploiting intrinsic angular domain sparsity of massive\nMIMO channels and the sporadic traffic of users, i.e., few number of users are\nactive to sent or receive data in each coherence interval. In fact, the angles\nof arrivals (AoAs) coming from active users are continuous parameters and can\ntake any arbitrary values. Besides, the AoAs corresponding to each active user\nare alongside each other forming a specific cluster. This work revolves around\nexploiting these features. Specifically, a blind clustering-based algorithm is\nproposed that not only recovers the transmitted data by users in grant free\nrandom access and primary pilots in random access blocks of coherent\ntransmission, but also provides accurate channel estimation. Our approach is\nbased on transforming the unknown variables into a higher dimensional space\nwith matrix variables. An off-grid atomic norm minimization is then proposed to\nobtain the unknown matrix from only a few observed arrays at the BS. Then, a\nclustering-based approach is employed to identify which AoAs correspond to\nwhich active users. After identifying active users and their AoAs, an\nalternating-based approach is performed to obtain the channels and data or\nprimary pilots of active users. Simulation results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach in AoA detection as well as data recovery.",

    "abstract": "Data acquisition and recording in the form of databases are routine\noperations. The process of collecting data, however, may experience\nirregularities, resulting in databases with missing data. Missing entries might\nalter analysis efficiency and, consequently, the associated decision-making\nprocess. This paper focuses on databases collecting information related to the\nnatural environment. Given the broad spectrum of recorded activities, these\ndatabases typically are of mixed nature. It is therefore relevant to evaluate\nthe performance of missing data processing methods considering this\ncharacteristic. In this paper we investigate the performances of several\nmissing data imputation methods and their application to the problem of missing\ndata in environment. A computational study was performed to compare the method\nmissForest (MF) with two other imputation methods, namely Multivariate\nImputation by Chained Equations (MICE) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Tests\nwere made on 10 pretreated datasets of various types. Results revealed that MF\ngenerally outperformed MICE and KNN in terms of imputation errors, with a more\npronounced performance gap for mixed typed databases where MF reduced the\nimputation error up to 150%, when compared to the other methods. KNN was\nusually the fastest method. MF was then successfully applied to a case study on\nQuebec wastewater treatment plants performance monitoring.

However, GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing\nworks mainly focus on attacking GNNs for node classification; nevertheless, the\nattacks against GNNs for graph classification have not been well explored.\nIn this work, we conduct a systematic study on adversarial attacks against\nGNNs for graph classification via perturbing the graph structure. In\nparticular, we focus on the most challenging attack, i.e., hard label black-box\nattack, where an attacker has no knowledge about the target GNN model and can\nonly obtain predicted labels through querying the target model.To achieve this\ngoal, we formulate our attack as an optimization problem, whose objective is to\nminimize the number of edges to be perturbed in a graph while maintaining the\nhigh attack success rate. The original optimization problem is intractable to\nsolve, and we relax the optimization problem to be a tractable one, which is\nsolved with theoretical convergence guarantee. We also design a coarse-grained\nsearching algorithm and a query-efficient gradient computation algorithm to\ndecrease the number of queries to the target GNN model. Our experimental\nresults on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our attack can\neffectively attack representative GNNs for graph classification with less\nqueries and perturbations. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our attack\nunder two defenses: one is well-designed adversarial graph detector and the\nother is that the target GNN model itself is equipped with a defense to prevent\nadversarial graph generation. Our experimental results show that such defenses\nare not effective enough, which highlights more advanced defenses.",

A novel\nhierarchical modified equation approach leads to an explicit scheme that does\nnot require any nonlinear iterations. The hierarchical approach at interfaces\nleads to local updates at the interface with no coupling in the tangential\ndirections. Complex geometry is treated with overset grids. Numerical stability\nis maintained using high-order upwind dissipation designed for Maxwell's\nequations in second-order form. The scheme is carefully verified for a number\nof two and three-dimensional problems. The resulting numerical model with\ngeneralized dispersion and arbitrary nonlinear multi-level system can be used\nfor many plasmonic applications such as for ab initio time domain modeling of\nnonlinear engineered materials for nanolasing applications, where\nnano-patterned plasmonic dispersive arrays are used to enhance otherwise weak\nnonlinearity in the active media.",

    "abstract": "LiDAR panoptic segmentation is a newly proposed technical task for autonomous\ndriving. In contrast to popular end-to-end deep learning solutions, we propose\na hybrid method with an existing semantic segmentation network to extract\nsemantic information and a traditional LiDAR point cloud cluster algorithm to\nsplit each instance object. We argue geometry-based traditional clustering\nalgorithms are worth being considered by showing a state-of-the-art performance\namong all published end-to-end deep learning solutions on the panoptic\nsegmentation leaderboard of the SemanticKITTI dataset. To our best knowledge,\nwe are the first to attempt the point cloud panoptic segmentation with\nclustering algorithms. Therefore, instead of working on new models, we give a\ncomprehensive technical survey in this paper by implementing four typical\ncluster methods and report their performances on the benchmark. Those four\ncluster methods are the most representative ones with real-time running speed.\nThey are implemented with C++ in this paper and then wrapped as a python\nfunction for seamless integration with the existing deep learning frameworks.\nWe release our code for peer researchers who might be interested in this\nproblem.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, automation is a critical topic due to its significant impacts on\nthe productivity of construction projects. Utilizing automation in this\nindustry brings about great results, such as remarkable improvements in the\nefficiency, quality, and safety of construction activities. The scope of\nautomation in construction includes a wide range of stages, and monitoring\nconstruction projects is no exception. Additionally, it is of great importance\nin project management since an accurate and timely assessment of project\nprogress enables managers to quickly identify deviations from the schedule and\ntake the required actions at the right time. In this stage, one of the most\nimportant tasks is to daily keep track of the project progress, which is very\ntime-consuming and labor-intensive, but automation has facilitated and\naccelerated this task. It also eliminated or at least decreased the risk of\nmany dangerous tasks. In this way, the first step of construction automation is\nto detect used materials in a project site automatically. In this paper, a\nnovel deep learning architecture is utilized, called Vision Transformer (ViT),\nfor detecting and classifying construction materials. To evaluate the\napplicability and performance of the proposed method, it is trained and tested\non three large imbalanced datasets, namely Construction Material Library (CML)\nand Building Material Dataset (BMD), used in the previous papers, as well as a\nnew dataset created by combining them. The achieved results revealed an\naccuracy of 100 percent in all parameters and also in each material category.\nIt is believed that the proposed method provides a novel and robust tool for\ndetecting and classifying different material types.",

Standard sonification methods reported\nin the literature involve either (i) using only a subset of the variables, or\n(ii) first solving a learning task on the data and then mapping the output to\nan audio waveform, which is utilized by the end-user to make a decision. This\npaper presents a novel framework for sonifying high-dimensional data using a\ncomplex growth transform dynamical system model where both the learning (or,\nmore generally, optimization) and the sonification processes are integrated\ntogether. Our algorithm takes as input the data and optimization parameters\nunderlying the learning or prediction task and combines it with the\npsychoacoustic parameters defined by the user. As a result, the proposed\nframework outputs binaural audio signatures that not only encode some\nstatistical properties of the high-dimensional data but also reveal the\nunderlying complexity of the optimization/learning process.

    "abstract": "Identifying cybersickness in virtual reality (VR) applications such as games\nin a fast, precise, non-intrusive, and non-disruptive way remains challenging.\nSeveral factors can cause cybersickness, and their identification will help\nfind its origins and prevent or minimize it. One such factor is virtual\nmovement. Movement, whether physical or virtual, can be represented in\ndifferent forms. One way to represent and store it is with a temporally\nannotated point sequence. Because a sequence is memory-consuming, it is often\npreferable to save it in a compressed form. Compression allows redundant data\nto be eliminated while still preserving changes in speed and direction. Since\nchanges in direction and velocity in VR can be associated with cybersickness,\nchanges in compression rate can likely indicate changes in cybersickness\nlevels. In this research, we explore whether quantifying changes in virtual\nmovement can be used to estimate variation in cybersickness levels of VR users.\nWe investigate the correlation between changes in the compression rate of\nmovement data in two VR games with changes in players' cybersickness levels\ncaptured during gameplay. Our results show (1) a clear correlation between\nchanges in compression rate and cybersickness, and(2) that a machine learning\napproach can be used to identify these changes.

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal (ST) image data are increasingly common and often\nhigh-dimensional (high-D). Modeling ST data can be a challenge due to the\nplethora of independent and interacting processes which may or may not\ncontribute to the measurements. Characterization can be considered the\ncomplement to modeling by helping guide assumptions about generative processes\nand their representation in the data. Dimensionality reduction (DR) is a\nfrequently implemented type of characterization designed to mitigate the \"curse\nof dimensionality\" on high-D signals. For decades, Principal Component (PC) and\nEmpirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis has been used as a linear,\ninvertible approach to DR and ST analysis. Recent years have seen the\nadditional development of a suite of nonlinear DR algorithms, frequently\ncategorized as \"manifold learning\". Here, we explore the idea of joint\ncharacterization of ST data manifolds using PCs/EOFs alongside two nonlinear DR\napproaches: Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor\nembedding (t-SNE). Starting with a synthetic example and progressing to global,\nregional, and field scale ST datasets spanning roughly 5 orders of magnitude in\nspace and 2 in time, we show these three DR approaches can yield complementary\ninformation about ST manifold topology. Compared to the relatively diffuse TFS\nproduced by PCs/EOFs, the nonlinear approaches yield more compact manifolds\nwith decreased ambiguity in temporal endmembers (LE) and/or in spatiotemporal\nclustering (t-SNE). These properties are compensated by the greater\ninterpretability, significantly lower computational demand and diminished\nsensitivity to spatial aliasing for PCs/EOFs than LE or t-SNE. Taken together,\nwe find joint characterization using the three complementary DR approaches\ncapable of greater insight into generative ST processes than possible using any\nsingle approach alone.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, visible-spectrum face verification systems have been shown\nto match expert forensic examiner recognition performance. However, such\nsystems are ineffective in low-light and nighttime conditions. Thermal face\nimagery, which captures body heat emissions, effectively augments the visible\nspectrum, capturing discriminative facial features in scenes with limited\nillumination. Due to the increased cost and difficulty of obtaining diverse,\npaired thermal and visible spectrum datasets, algorithms and large-scale\nbenchmarks for low-light recognition are limited. This paper presents an\nalgorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the ARL-VTF and\nTUFTS multi-spectral face datasets. Importantly, we study the impact of face\nalignment, pixel-level correspondence, and identity classification with label\nsmoothing for multi-spectral face synthesis and verification. We show that our\nproposed method is widely applicable, robust, and highly effective. In\naddition, we show that the proposed method significantly outperforms face\nfrontalization methods on profile-to-frontal verification. Finally, we present\nMILAB-VTF(B), a challenging multi-spectral face dataset that is composed of\npaired thermal and visible videos. To the best of our knowledge, with face data\nfrom 400 subjects, this dataset represents the most extensive collection of\npublicly available indoor and long-range outdoor thermal-visible face imagery.\nLastly, we show that our end-to-end thermal-to-visible face verification system\nprovides strong performance on the MILAB-VTF(B) dataset.",

    "title": "Towards a Theory on Architecting for Continuous Deployment",
    "abstract": "Context: As the adoption of continuous delivery practices increases in\nsoftware organizations, different scenarios struggle to make it scales for\ntheir products in long-term evolution. This study looks at the concrete\nsoftware architecture as a relevant factor for successfully achieving\ncontinuous delivery goals. Objective: This study aims to understand how the\ndesign of software architectures impacts the continuous deployment of their\nsoftware product. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review to\nidentify proper evidence regarding the research objective. We analyzed the\nselected sources adopting a synthesis and analysis approach based on Grounded\nTheory. Results: We selected 14 primary sources. Through our analysis process,\nwe developed a theory that explains the phenomenon of Architecting for\nContinuous Deployment. The theory describes three other phenomena that support\nArchitecting for Continuous Deployment: Supporting Operations, Continuous\nEvolution, and Improving Deployability. Furthermore, the theory comprises the\nfollowing elements: contexts, actions and interactions, quality attributes,\nprinciples, and effects. We instantiated these elements and identified their\ninterrelationships. The theory is supported by providing bi-directional\ntraceability from the selected sources to the elements and vice-versa.\nConclusions: Developing adequate architecture plays a crucial role in enabling\ncontinuous delivery. Supporting operations becomes vital to increase the\ndeployability and monitorability of software architecture. These two outcomes\nrequire that developers accept responsibility for maintaining the operations.\nThe continuous evolution of the architecture is essential, but it must consider\nbalanced management of technical debt. Finally, improving deployability\nrequires attention to the test strategy and how it affects downtime to enable\nefficient pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Software engineers regularly use JavaScript and Python for both front-end and\nback-end automation tasks. On top of JavaScript and Python, there are several\nframeworks to facilitate automation tasks further. Some of these frameworks are\nNode Manager Package (npm) and Python Package Index (PyPi), which are open\nsource (OS) package libraries. The public registries npm and PyPi use to host\npackages allow any user with a verified email to publish code. The lack of a\ncomprehensive scanning tool when publishing to the registry creates security\nconcerns. Users can report malicious code on the registry; however, attackers\ncan still cause damage until they remove their tool from the platform.\nFurthermore, several packages depend on each other, making them more vulnerable\nto a bad package in the dependency tree. The heavy code reuse creates security\nartifacts developers have to consider, such as the package reach. This project\nwill illustrate a high-level overview of common risks associated with OS\nregistries and the package dependency structure. There are several attack\ntypes, such as typosquatting and combosquatting, in the OS package registries.\nOutdated packages pose a security risk, and we will examine the extent of\ntechnical lag present in the npm environment. In this paper, our main\ncontribution consists of a survey of common threats in OS registries.\nAfterward, we will offer countermeasures to mitigate the risks presented. These\nremedies will heavily focus on the applications of Machine Learning (ML) to\ndetect suspicious activities. To the best of our knowledge, the ML-focused\ncountermeasures are the first proposed possible solutions to the security\nproblems listed. In addition, this project is the first survey of threats in\nnpm and PyPi, although several studies focus on a subset of threats.",

Soft Rasterization methods have achieved accurate 3D\nreconstruction from 2D images with viewpoint supervision only. In this work, we\nfurther reduce the labeling effort by allowing such 3D reconstruction methods\nleverage unlabeled images.

We give the first theoretical work studying online algorithms for the\nproblem, which guarantees a worst-case performance. We first consider the\noffline problem knowing future truck trip information far ahead of time. By\ndelicately transforming the problem into a graph satisfying both time and power\nconstraints, we present a shortest-path algorithm that outputs the optimal\nsolution of the problem. Then, we proceed to the online setting where trucks\nappear in real-time and only inform the UAV of their trip information some\ncertain time $\\Delta t$ beforehand.

However, few research efforts to consider $(H, r, u)$\nmultiaccess combination network problem where each $u$ users are connected to a\nunique set of $r$ relays. A naive strategy to obtain a coded caching scheme for\n$(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network is by $u$ times repeated\napplication of a coded caching scheme for a traditional $(H, r)$ combination\nnetwork. Obviously, the transmission load for each relay of this trivial scheme\nis exactly $u$ times that of the original scheme, which implies that as the\nnumber of users multiplies, the transmission load for each relay will also\nmultiply. Therefore, it is very meaningful to design a coded caching scheme for\n$(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network with lower transmission load for\neach relay. In this paper, by directly applying the well known coding method\n(proposed by Zewail and Yener) for $(H, r)$ combination network, a coded\ncaching scheme (ZY scheme) for $(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network is\nobtained. However, the subpacketization of this scheme has exponential order\nwith the number of users, which leads to a high implementation complexity. In\norder to reduce the subpacketization, a direct construction of a coded caching\nscheme for $(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network is proposed by means of\nCombinational Design Theory, where the parameter $u$ must be a combinatorial\nnumber. For arbitrary parameter $u$, a hybrid construction of a coded caching\nscheme for $(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network is proposed based on our\ndirect construction. Theoretical and numerical analysis show that our last two\nschemes have smaller transmission load for each relay compared with the trivial\nscheme, and have much lower subpacketization compared with ZY scheme.",

Privacy and\nintegrity preserving features such as differential privacy (DP) and robust\naggregation (RA) are commonly used in FL. In this work, we show that on common\ndeep learning tasks, the performance of FL models differs amongst clients and\nsituations, and FL models can sometimes perform worse than local models due to\nnon-i.i.d. data. Secondly, we show that incorporating DP and RA degrades\nperformance further. Then, we conduct an ablation study on the performance\nimpact of different combinations of common personalization approaches for FL,\nsuch as finetuning, mixture-of-experts ensemble, multi-task learning, and\nknowledge distillation. It is observed that certain combinations of\npersonalization approaches are more impactful in certain scenarios while others\nalways improve performance, and combination approaches are better than\nindividual ones. Most clients obtained better performance with combined\npersonalized FL and recover from performance degradation caused by non-i.i.d.\ndata, DP, and RA.",

    "title": "Evaluation Methodologies for Code Learning Tasks",
    "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in developing machine learning (ML) models\nfor code learning tasks, e.g., comment generation and method naming. Despite\nsubstantial increase in the effectiveness of ML models, the evaluation\nmethodologies, i.e., the way people split datasets into training, validation,\nand testing sets, were not well designed. Specifically, no prior work on the\naforementioned topics considered the timestamps of code and comments during\nevaluation (e.g., examples in the testing set might be from 2010 and examples\nfrom the training set might be from 2020). This may lead to evaluations that\nare inconsistent with the intended use cases of the ML models. In this paper,\nwe formalize a novel time-segmented evaluation methodology, as well as the two\nmethodologies commonly used in the literature: mixed-project and cross-project.\nWe argue that time-segmented methodology is the most realistic. We also\ndescribe various use cases of ML models and provide a guideline for using\nmethodologies to evaluate each use case. To assess the impact of methodologies,\nwe collect a dataset of code-comment pairs with timestamps to train and\nevaluate several recent code learning ML models for the comment generation and\nmethod naming tasks. Our results show that different methodologies can lead to\nconflicting and inconsistent results. We invite the community to adopt the\ntime-segmented evaluation methodology.",

    "abstract": "The asymptotic stable region and long-time decay rate of solutions to linear\nhomogeneous Caputo time fractional ordinary differential equations (F-ODEs) are\nknown to be completely determined by the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix.\nVery different from the exponential decay of solutions to classical ODEs,\nsolutions of F-ODEs decay only polynomially, leading to the so-called\nMittag-Leffler stability, which was already extended to semi-linear F-ODEs with\nsmall perturbations. This work is mainly devoted to the qualitative analysis of\nthe long-time behavior of numerical solutions. By applying the singularity\nanalysis of generating functions developed by Flajolet and Odlyzko (SIAM J.\nDisc. Math. 3 (1990), 216-240), we are able to prove that both $\\mathcal{L}$1\nscheme and strong $A$-stable fractional linear multistep methods (F-LMMs) can\npreserve the numerical Mittag-Leffler stability for linear homogeneous F-ODEs\nexactly as in the continuous case. Through an improved estimate of the discrete\nfractional resolvent operator, we show that strong $A$-stable F-LMMs are also\nMittag-Leffler stable for semi-linear F-ODEs under small perturbations. For the\nnumerical schemes based on $\\alpha$-difference approximation to Caputo\nderivative, we establish the Mittag-Leffler stability for semi-linear problems\nby making use of properties of the Poisson transformation and the decay rate of\nthe continuous fractional resolvent operator. Numerical experiments are\npresented for several typical time fractional evolutional equations, including\ntime fractional sub-diffusion equations, fractional linear system and\nsemi-linear F-ODEs. All the numerical results exhibit the typical long-time\npolynomial decay rate, which is fully consistent with our theoretical\npredictions.",

A lot of theories and algorithms have been developed to model such\nnetworks (e.g., balance theory). However, previous work mainly focuses on the\nunipartite signed networks where the nodes have the same type. Signed bipartite\nnetworks are different from classical signed networks, which contain two\ndifferent node sets and signed links between two node sets. Signed bipartite\nnetworks can be commonly found in many fields including business, politics, and\nacademics, but have been less studied. In this work, we firstly define the\nsigned relationship of the same set of nodes and provide a new perspective for\nanalyzing signed bipartite networks. Then we do some comprehensive analysis of\nbalance theory from two perspectives on several real-world datasets.\nSpecifically, in the peer review dataset, we find that the ratio of balanced\nisomorphism in signed bipartite networks increased after rebuttal phases.\nGuided by these two perspectives, we propose a novel Signed Bipartite Graph\nNeural Networks (SBGNNs) to learn node embeddings for signed bipartite\nnetworks. SBGNNs follow most GNNs message-passing scheme, but we design new\nmessage functions, aggregation functions, and update functions for signed\nbipartite networks.

Recent attempts focused on training a classifier\nto recognize certain patterns of gestures (e.g., standing, walking, etc) with\nthe use of neural networks like CNN or LSTM. Nevertheless, they often consider\nvery few types of gestures and/or induce less desired latency in virtual\nenvironments. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for accurate and\nefficient classification of in-place gestures. Our key idea is to treat several\nconsecutive frames as a \"point cloud\". The HMD and two VIVE trackers provide\nthree points in each frame, with each point consisting of 12-dimensional\nfeatures (i.e., three-dimensional position coordinates, velocity, rotation,\nangular velocity). We create a dataset consisting of 9 gesture classes for\nvirtual in-place locomotion. In addition to the supervised point-based network,\nwe also take unsupervised domain adaptation into account due to inter-person\nvariations. To this end, we develop an end-to-end joint framework involving\nboth a supervised loss for supervised point learning and an unsupervised loss\nfor unsupervised domain adaptation. Experiments demonstrate that our approach\ngenerates very promising outcomes, in terms of high overall classification\naccuracy (95.0%) and real-time performance (192ms latency).

    "abstract": "Recently, learning-based algorithms have shown impressive performance in\nunderwater image enhancement. Most of them resort to training on synthetic data\nand achieve outstanding performance. However, these methods ignore the\nsignificant domain gap between the synthetic and real data (i.e., interdomain\ngap), and thus the models trained on synthetic data often fail to generalize\nwell to real underwater scenarios. Furthermore, the complex and changeable\nunderwater environment also causes a great distribution gap among the real data\nitself (i.e., intra-domain gap). However, almost no research focuses on this\nproblem and thus their techniques often produce visually unpleasing artifacts\nand color distortions on various real images. Motivated by these observations,\nwe propose a novel Two-phase Underwater Domain Adaptation network (TUDA) to\nsimultaneously minimize the inter-domain and intra-domain gap. Concretely, a\nnew dual-alignment network is designed in the first phase, including a\ntranslation part for enhancing realism of input images, followed by an\nenhancement part. With performing image-level and feature-level adaptation in\ntwo parts by jointly adversarial learning, the network can better build\ninvariance across domains and thus bridge the inter-domain gap. In the second\nphase, we perform an easy-hard classification of real data according to the\nassessed quality of enhanced images, where a rank-based underwater quality\nassessment method is embedded. By leveraging implicit quality information\nlearned from rankings, this method can more accurately assess the perceptual\nquality of enhanced images. Using pseudo labels from the easy part, an\neasy-hard adaptation technique is then conducted to effectively decrease the\nintra-domain gap between easy and hard samples.",

Towards\neffective learning outcome assessment, the exam script generation problem has\nattracted many attentions and been investigated recently. But the research in\nthis field is still in its early stage. There are opportunities to further\nimprove the quality of generated exam scripts in various aspects. In\nparticular, two essential issues have been ignored largely by existing\nsolutions. First, given a course, it is unknown yet how to generate an exam\nscript which can result in a desirable distribution of student scores in a\nclass (or across different classes). Second, while it is frequently encountered\nin practice, it is unknown so far how to generate a pair of high quality exam\nscripts which are equivalent in assessment (i.e., the student scores are\ncomparable by taking either of them) but have significantly different sets of\nquestions.

Accordingly, pursuing the best prediction\nperformance corresponds to optimizing the pipeline by solving all of its\ninvolved optimization problems. This is a non-trivial task due to the vastness\nof the solution space. Different from most of the existing works which target\nat optimizing certain components of the pipeline, we propose a novel\nevolutionary ensemble learning framework to optimize the entire pipeline in a\nholistic manner. In this framework, a specific pipeline is encoded as a\ncandidate solution and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is applied\nunder different population sizes to produce multiple Pareto optimal sets\n(POSs). Finally, selective ensemble learning is designed to choose the optimal\nsubset of solutions from the POSs and combine them to yield final prediction by\nusing greedy sequential selection and least square methods. We implement the\nproposed framework and evaluate our implementation on two real-world\napplications, i.e., electricity consumption prediction and air quality\nprediction. The performance comparison with state-of-the-art techniques\ndemonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we abandon the dominant complex language model and rethink the\nlinguistic learning process in the scene text recognition. Different from\nprevious methods considering the visual and linguistic information in two\nseparate structures, we propose a Visual Language Modeling Network (VisionLAN),\nwhich views the visual and linguistic information as a union by directly\nenduing the vision model with language capability. Specially, we introduce the\ntext recognition of character-wise occluded feature maps in the training stage.\nSuch operation guides the vision model to use not only the visual texture of\ncharacters, but also the linguistic information in visual context for\nrecognition when the visual cues are confused (e.g. occlusion, noise, etc.). As\nthe linguistic information is acquired along with visual features without the\nneed of extra language model, VisionLAN significantly improves the speed by 39%\nand adaptively considers the linguistic information to enhance the visual\nfeatures for accurate recognition. Furthermore, an Occlusion Scene Text (OST)\ndataset is proposed to evaluate the performance on the case of missing\ncharacter-wise visual cues. The state of-the-art results on several benchmarks\nprove our effectiveness. Code and dataset are available at\nhttps://github.com/wangyuxin87/VisionLAN.",

However, visual relation learning\nis a long-tailed problem, due to the combinatorial nature of joint reasoning\nabout groups of objects. Increasing model complexity is, in general, ill-suited\nfor long-tailed problems due to their tendency to overfit. In this paper, we\nexplore an alternative hypothesis, denoted the Devil is in the Tails. Under\nthis hypothesis, better performance is achieved by keeping the model simple but\nimproving its ability to cope with long-tailed distributions. To test this\nhypothesis, we devise a new approach for training visual relationships models,\nwhich is inspired by state-of-the-art long-tailed recognition literature. This\nis based on an iterative decoupled training scheme, denoted Decoupled Training\nfor Devil in the Tails (DT2). DT2 employs a novel sampling approach,\nAlternating Class-Balanced Sampling (ACBS), to capture the interplay between\nthe long-tailed entity and predicate distributions of visual relations. Results\nshow that, with an extremely simple architecture, DT2-ACBS significantly\noutperforms much more complex state-of-the-art methods on scene graph\ngeneration tasks.

    "abstract": "Recently proposed neural architecture search (NAS) methods co-train billions\nof architectures in a supernet and estimate their potential accuracy using the\nnetwork weights detached from the supernet. However, the ranking correlation\nbetween the architectures' predicted accuracy and their actual capability is\nincorrect, which causes the existing NAS methods' dilemma. We attribute this\nranking correlation problem to the supernet training consistency shift,\nincluding feature shift and parameter shift. Feature shift is identified as\ndynamic input distributions of a hidden layer due to random path sampling. The\ninput distribution dynamic affects the loss descent and finally affects\narchitecture ranking. Parameter shift is identified as contradictory parameter\nupdates for a shared layer lay in different paths in different training steps.\nThe rapidly-changing parameter could not preserve architecture ranking. We\naddress these two shifts simultaneously using a nontrivial supernet-Pi model,\ncalled Pi-NAS. Specifically, we employ a supernet-Pi model that contains\ncross-path learning to reduce the feature consistency shift between different\npaths. Meanwhile, we adopt a novel nontrivial mean teacher containing negative\nsamples to overcome parameter shift and model collision. Furthermore, our\nPi-NAS runs in an unsupervised manner, which can search for more transferable\narchitectures. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and a wide range of downstream\ntasks (e.g., COCO 2017, ADE20K, and Cityscapes) demonstrate the effectiveness\nand universality of our Pi-NAS compared to supervised NAS.

This leads to\nregions in which a distinct binary design is difficult to achieve. Interpreting\nintermediate density values by applying a threshold results in large solid or\nvoid regions, leading to sub-optimal structures.

    "abstract": "This paper examines a class of PDEs where some part of the PDE system evolves\na vector field whose curl remains zero or grows in proportion to specified\nsource terms. Such PDEs are referred to as curl-free or curl-preserving\nrespectively. In this paper we catalogue a class of DG-like schemes for such\nPDEs. To retain the globally curl-free or curl-preserving constraints, the\ncomponents of the vector field, as well as their higher moments, have to be\ncollocated at the edges of the mesh. They are updated by using potentials that\nare collocated at the vertices of the mesh. The resulting schemes : 1) do not\nblow up even after very long integration times, 2) do not need any special\ncleaning treatment, 3) can operate with large explicit timesteps, 4) do not\nrequire the solution of an elliptic system and 5) can be extended to higher\norders using DG-like methods. The methods rely on a special curl-preserving\nreconstruction and they also rely on multidimensional upwinding. The Galerkin\nprojection, so crucial to the design of a DG method, is now carried out in the\nedges of the mesh and yields a weak form update that uses potentials that are\nobtained at the vertices of the mesh with the help of a multidimensional\nRiemann solver. A von Neumann stability analysis of the curl-preserving methods\nis carried out and the limiting CFL numbers of this entire family of methods is\ncatalogued in this work. The stability analysis confirms that with increasing\norder of accuracy, our novel curl-free methods have superlative phase accuracy\nwhile substantially reducing dissipation.

    "abstract": "Curriculum learning is a bio-inspired training technique that is widely\nadopted to machine learning for improved optimization and better training of\nneural networks regarding the convergence rate or obtained accuracy. The main\nconcept in curriculum learning is to start the training with simpler tasks and\ngradually increase the level of difficulty. Therefore, a natural question is\nhow to determine or generate these simpler tasks. In this work, we take\ninspiration from Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) in order to form an\neasy-to-hard curriculum. As STNs have been proven to be capable of removing the\nclutter from the input images and obtaining higher accuracy in image\nclassification tasks, we hypothesize that images processed by STNs can be seen\nas easier tasks and utilized in the interest of curriculum learning. To this\nend, we study multiple strategies developed for shaping the training\ncurriculum, using the data generated by STNs. We perform various experiments on\ncluttered MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, where on the former, we obtain an\nimprovement of $3.8$pp in classification accuracy compared to the baseline.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we seek reasons for the two major failure cases in Semantic\nSegmentation (SS): 1) missing small objects or minor object parts, and 2)\nmislabeling minor parts of large objects as wrong classes. We have an\ninteresting finding that Failure-1 is due to the underuse of detailed features\nand Failure-2 is due to the underuse of visual contexts. To help the model\nlearn a better trade-off, we introduce several Self-Regulation (SR) losses for\ntraining SS neural networks. By \"self\", we mean that the losses are from the\nmodel per se without using any additional data or supervision. By applying the\nSR losses, the deep layer features are regulated by the shallow ones to\npreserve more details; meanwhile, shallow layer classification logits are\nregulated by the deep ones to capture more semantics. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on both weakly and fully supervised SS tasks, and the results show\nthat our approach consistently surpasses the baselines. We also validate that\nSR losses are easy to implement in various state-of-the-art SS models, e.g.,\nSPGNet and OCRNet, incurring little computational overhead during training and\nnone for testing.",

    "abstract": "Upon the discovery of adversarial attacks, robust models have become\nobligatory for deep learning-based systems. Adversarial training with\nfirst-order attacks has been one of the most effective defenses against\nadversarial perturbations to this day. The majority of the adversarial training\napproaches focus on iteratively perturbing each pixel with the gradient of the\nloss function with respect to the input image. However, the adversarial\ntraining with gradient-based attacks lacks diversity and does not generalize\nwell to natural images and various attacks. This study presents a robust\ntraining algorithm where the adversarial perturbations are automatically\nsynthesized from a random vector using a generator network. The classifier is\ntrained with cross-entropy loss regularized with the optimal transport distance\nbetween the representations of the natural and synthesized adversarial samples.\nUnlike prevailing generative defenses, the proposed one-step attack generation\nframework synthesizes diverse perturbations without utilizing gradient of the\nclassifier's loss. Experimental results show that the proposed approach attains\ncomparable robustness with various gradient-based and generative robust\ntraining techniques on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN datasets. In addition,\ncompared to the baselines, the proposed robust training framework generalizes\nwell to the natural samples. Code and trained models will be made publicly\navailable.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled positioning that uses UAVs as aerial\nanchor nodes is a promising solution for providing positioning services in\nharsh environments. In previous research, the state sensing and control of UAVs\nwere either ignored or simply set to be performed continuously, resulting in\nsystem instability or waste of wireless resources. Therefore, in this article,\nwe propose a quality-of-service (QoS)-oriented UAV-enabled positioning system\nbased on the concept of sensing-communication-control (SCC) co-design. We first\nestablish the mathematical models of UAV state sensing and control. Then, the\ninfluence of sensing scheduling and transmission failure on UAV stability, as\nwell as the performance of positioning services in the presence of UAV control\nerror, are analyzed. Based on these models and analysis results, we further\nstudy the problem of minimizing the amount of data transmitted by optimizing\nthe sensing scheduling and blocklength allocation under the condition of\nsatisfying each user's demand. Finally, an efficient scheme is developed to\nsolve this mixed-integer nonlinear problem. Numerical results show that the\nproposed system could work efficiently and meet users' requirements. In\naddition, compared with two benchmark schemes, our scheme reduces the failure\nrate or resource consumption of positioning services by more than 76.2% or\n82.7%.",

The\nwireless channel remains constant within the channel coherence time but can\nchange rapidly across blocks.

This problem can be cast into the stochastic bandit\nframework, and the unawareness of time-stamps where channel changes\nnecessitates running change-point detection simultaneously with stochastic\nbandit algorithms to improve adaptivity. We present a joint channel\nchange-point detection and link rate selection algorithm based on Thompson\nSampling (CD-TS) and show it can achieve a sublinear regret with respect to the\nnumber of time steps $T$ when the channel coherence time is larger than a\nthreshold. We then improve the CD-TS algorithm by considering the fact that\nhigher transmission rate has higher packet-loss probability.

    "abstract": "While digital social protection systems have been claimed to bring efficacy\nin user identification and entitlement assignation, their data justice\nimplications have been questioned. In particular, the delivery of subsidies\nbased on biometric identification has been found to magnify exclusions, imply\ninformational asymmetries, and reproduce policy structures that negatively\naffect recipients. In this paper, we use a data justice lens to study Rythu\nBharosa, a social welfare scheme targeting farmers in the Andhra Pradesh state\nof India. While coverage of the scheme in terms of number of recipients is\nreportedly high, our fieldwork revealed three forms of data justice to be\nmonitored for intended recipients. A first form is design-related, as\nmismatches of recipients with their registered biometric credentials and bank\naccount details are associated to denial of subsidies. A second form is\ninformational, as users who do not receive subsidies are often not informed of\nthe reason why it is so, or of the grievance redressal processes available to\nthem. To these dimensions our data add a structural one, centred on the\nconditionality of subsidy to approval by landowners, which forces tenant\nfarmers to request a type of landowner consent that reproduces existing\npatterns of class and caste subordination. Identifying such data justice\nissues, the paper adds to problematisations of digital social welfare systems,\ncontributing a structural dimension to studies of data justice in digital\nsocial protection.",

    "title": "Establishing Data Warehouse to Improve Standardize Health Care Delivery:  A Protocol Development in Jakarta City",
    "abstract": "Jakarta is a metropolitan city and among the most dense city in Indonesia.\nJakarta has 12 major indicators of standardize health care delivery (Standard\nPelayanan Minimum or SPM) derivates from Ministry of Health consists of\nservices related to maternal and neonatal health, school-aged population,\nworking-age population, elderly population, some specific conditions\n(hypertension, diabetes, tuberculosis, HIV), and also mental health. We planned\nto construct a data warehouse to provide a single integrated data center. In\nthe first phase (2021), we improve the system by giving responsibility to the\nhealth Sub Department of Health of Administrative City for direct data input\ninto a data warehouse. This period also let an introduction and adaptation to\nnew data collection schemes by using a single entry for the first time. The\nbasic platform use for this system is District Health Information System 2\n(DHIS-2), an open-source platform that has been used worldwide, including\nMinistry of Health Republic of Indonesia. The major advantage of this data\nwarehouse is the simplicity and convenience to collect a wide data from a\ndifferent source and presenting it faster than using the conventional system.\nLess data contradiction was also found between health programs with\nintersecting data. During this transition phase, a double-work is made as data\nshould be input to both the DHIS-2 system by Jakarta and the National Ministry\nof Health system, but an integration process is ongoing, and hopefully that in\n2022 single data entry can be established.",

    "abstract": "SARS CoV-2 infection and transmission are problematic in developing countries\nsuch as Indonesia. Due to the lack of an information system, Provinces must be\nable to innovate in developing information systems related to surveillance of\nSARS CoV-2 infection. Jakarta Department of Health built a data management\nsystem called Executive Information System (EIS) of COVID-19 Reporting. EIS\naimed to provide actual data so that current epidemiological analysis is\naccurate. The main idea of EIS is to provide valid and actual information to\nstakeholders, which can then be presented in the form of a dashboard. EIS is\nutilized to push data flow and management for rapid surveillance purposes. This\ncould be the first time in Indonesia that a system reports near-actual data of\nnearly half a million people daily using an integrated system through a\ntransparent system. The main data presented is important to monitor and\nevaluate COVID-19 transmission is the cumulative case dan daily case number.\nData in EIS also can offer data geographically so that a more detailed analysis\ncould be done. EIS's data and the dashboard help the government in pandemic\ncontrol by presenting actual data on bed occupancy and availability across\nhospitals, especially isolation wards. Stakeholders, academic institutions\nshould utilize EIS data and other elements to help Indonesia fight COVID-19.",

Especially in a\ndeveloping economy like Nigeria, where tech start-up founders are faced with\ndiverse form of constraints and environmental uncertainties. Extant literature\nindicated that studies are been conducted to explain tech start-up emergence.\nHowever, such studies are fragmented with findings that are determinants to\ntech start-up emergence, with several determinants studied in isolation, and\nthe emergence as linear and unidimensional events. Consequently, neglecting\nmulti-dimensional perspective, which aggregate the dimensions of events\ncharacterizing tech start-up emergence. Given the iterative, event-based\nprocess, and interactive-dependent nature of tech start-up ventures to create\nactivity-based products/services in an open, uncertain, nonlinear and dynamic\nenvironment, we argue that little are been known about tech start-up emergence.\nThus, by drawing from synthesize literature review, activity theory, and\nexploratory case study design we identify opportunity discovery and selection;\nteam formation and domain consensus; bootstrapping; minimum viable product\ndevelopment and market experimentation feedback as interdependent\nmulti-dimensional events constituting tech start-up emergence in Nigerian tech\nstart-up ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Social media provides an extended space for collective action, as netizens\nleverage it as a tool for claim-making and for demanding the dividends of\ngovernance. However, political regimes often greet expanding use of social\nmedia with censorship, which netizens often have to contend with, particularly\nin the quest for development outcomes. While existing studies having\nexpansively explored multiple uses of social media, the specific features that\nsignal their massive uptake and how this intersects with the quest for\npolitical power has not been substantially documented. This paper argues that\nsocial media is characterized by social buttons that expedite the\nmultiplication of 'digital bullets' - in forms of tweets and perceived\ndetestable comments - which compromise the defense lines of political regimes,\nhence, their uptake of censorship as metaphorical 'flak jackets'. This research\nis conducted on the basis of key informant interviews with voices against\nsocial media censorship in Nigeria since the inception of Nigeria's ruling\ngovernment in 2015, particularly following the proposed 'Protection from\nInternet Falsehood and Manipulations Bill' in 2019.",

This\nresearch-in-progress report introduces a project on Emergency Remote Teaching\n(ERT) measures in the ten member states of the Economic Cooperation\nOrganization (ECO) with a focus on the application of Information and\nCommunication Technologies (ICTs) in primary and secondary education levels.\nThe project takes a comparative approach within a resilient ICT-for-Development\n(ICT4D) framework, where the coping, endurance, and return to pre-crisis\nfunctionalities in education systems are studied. The preliminary research\ndemonstrates the impacts of the country's general COVID-19 strategy, the\neducation system in place, and digital infrastructure's level of development on\ninstigating distance-learning platforms. The paper further shows that in\naddition to access to stable internet connections and digital devices, other\ninfrastructural factors such as access to food, electricity and health services\nplay a significant role in education response planning and implementation.\nHuman factors in the education system, such as teacher training for the usage\nof ICTs, digital literacy of students and parents, and already existing\nvulnerabilities in the education system pose challenges to crisis management in\nthe education sector.

    "abstract": "The use of mobile payment services is an essential contributor to financial\ninclusion in emerging markets. Unfortunately, the service has become a platform\nfor fraud. Mobile payment users need to be digitally resilient to continue\nusing the service after adverse events. However, there is scant literature on\nusers' continuance use of mobile payment services in the post-event of fraud.\nThe focal point of prior literature has been on technology adoption or threat\navoidance to implement policies that protect users. Analysing the relationship\nbetween individual digital resilience and post-adoption behavioural patterns\nwill enable service providers to support individual digital resilience to\npromote users' continuance use of the service. This research aims to develop\nand empirically validate a conceptual model to examine individual digital\nresilience in the context of the continuance use of mobile payments. The model\nwill be based on protection motivation theory. Survey data will be obtained\nfrom victims of mobile payment fraud and other users who continue using the\nservice despite their knowledge of mobile payment fraud.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables the multiple participating devices to\ncollaboratively contribute to a global neural network model while keeping the\ntraining data locally. Unlike the centralized training setting, the non-IID,\nimbalanced (statistical heterogeneity) and distribution shifted training data\nof FL is distributed in the federated network, which will increase the\ndivergences between the local models and the global model, further degrading\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a flexible clustered federated learning\n(CFL) framework named FlexCFL, in which we 1) group the training of clients\nbased on the similarities between the clients' optimization directions for\nlower training divergence; 2) implement an efficient newcomer device cold start\nmechanism for framework scalability and practicality; 3) flexibly migrate\nclients to meet the challenge of client-level data distribution shift. FlexCFL\ncan achieve improvements by dividing joint optimization into groups of\nsub-optimization and can strike a balance between accuracy and communication\nefficiency in the distribution shift environment. The convergence and\ncomplexity are analyzed to demonstrate the efficiency of FlexCFL. We also\nevaluate FlexCFL on several open datasets and made comparisons with related CFL\nframeworks. The results show that FlexCFL can significantly improve absolute\ntest accuracy by +10.6% on FEMNIST compared to FedAvg, +3.5% on FashionMNIST\ncompared to FedProx, +8.4% on MNIST compared to FeSEM.

In last two decades, Information and communication\ntechnologies (ICTs), by virtue of their ability to integrate information for\naction, has been extensively used in addressing many public health problems\nlike malnutrition. Tackling the public health challenge of malnutrition demands\nattention to interconnectedness and interactions between multiple systems. In\nthis paper, using a case study of an ICT application used by community workers\nfor malnutrition management in Karnataka, we argue that lack of recognition of\ninterconnectedness and interactions among stakeholders and context can pose a\nchallenge to integration of care. ICTs can be key enablers to overcome\nfragmentation, provided it recognizes the inherent complexities of malnutrition\nand its management.

    "abstract": "Automated production systems (aPS) are highly customized systems that consist\nof hardware and software. Such aPS are controlled by a programmable logic\ncontroller (PLC), often in accordance with the IEC 61131-3 standard that\ndivides system implementation into so-called program organization units (POUs)\nas the smallest software unit and is comprised of multiple textual and\ngraphical programming languages that can be arbitrarily nested. A common\npractice during the development of such systems is reusing implementation\nartifacts by copying, pasting, and then modifying code. This approach is\nreferred to as code cloning. It is used on a fine-granular level where a POU is\ncloned within a system variant. It is also applied on the coarse-granular\nsystem level, where the entire system is cloned and adapted to create a system\nvariant, for example for another customer. This ad hoc practice for the\ndevelopment of variants is commonly referred to as clone-and-own. It allows the\nfast development of variants to meet varying customer requirements or altered\nregulatory guidelines. However, clone-and-own is a non-sustainable approach and\ndoes not scale with an increasing number of variants. It has a detrimental\neffect on the overall quality of a software system, such as the propagation of\nbugs to other variants, which harms maintenance. In order to support the\neffective development and maintenance of such systems, a detailed code clone\nanalysis is required. On the one hand, an analysis of code clones within a\nvariant (i.e., clone detection in the classical sense) supports experts in\nrefactoring respective code into library components. On the other hand, an\nanalysis of commonalities and differences between cloned variants (i.e.,\nvariability analysis) supports the maintenance and further reuse and\nfacilitates the migration of variants into a software product line (SPL).",

Despite this, the number of times Nigerian\nuniversities suffer from cyber-attacks and the losses that result from them\nkeeps increasing. Our observation, however, indicates that most Nigerian\nuniversities run their cyber security without using scientifically derived\nframeworks that spell out how to manage threats and breaches that emanate from\nwithin and outside them. We consider this a problem to ongoing efforts made by\nNigerian universities to mitigate cyber security threats and breaches.

    "title": "The Decision Criteria Used by Large Enterprises in South Africa for the  Adoption of Cloud Computing",
    "abstract": "Cloud computing is a technology that has become increasingly popular over the\npast decade within several enterprises. This popularity can be attributed to\nits benefits, including lower operating costs, improved computational\ncapabilities, increased flexibility and on-demand storage space. As a result,\nmany enterprises are already in various Cloud Computing (CC) adoption and\nimplementation stages. This study investigates the decision criteria used by\nlarge enterprises in South Africa (SA) for the adoption of cloud technology.\nThe majority of large enterprises have comprehensive resources, resulting in\nestablished Information Technology (IT) systems and infrastructure set up\nwithin their organizations. Though this is the case, the adoption of CC by\nlarge enterprises has been on the rise. This may not be a surprise as CC\nliterature points out to benefits and influencers of CC adoption. However, the\ndecision criteria used by large enterprises in SA in adopting CC are lacking in\nthe literature reviewed. The study followed an inductive approach making use of\nqualitative methods. Findings revealed that large enterprises do not make use\nof a formalized or standardized decision criteria. However, operational cost,\nenterprise strategic intent and product efficiency formed key criteria for\nadopting CC. In addition, security, cloud service provider adoption frameworks\nand data sovereignty were the key criteria used to select a CC service\nprovider. The research will contribute towards CC technology adoption\nliterature, particularly for developing countries.",

This research paper looks\nat the adoption of e-commerce as a sustainable marketplace by the\nmicro-entrepreneur sellers from the lower socio-economic rural communities in\nIndia, a booming digital economy in the Global South. 'Sustainability' here\nrefers to a model for sustainable economic development sustaining the\ne-commerce as business model for the rural micro-entrepreneurs to flourish.\nThis paper explores rural development by dismantling the factors that shape the\nways technology and trade impact micro-entrepreneurs.

Recent information and\neconomic policy changes in India, along with the expansion of mobile\ninfrastructure and a growing user base in rural regions makes this research\ntimely and important. By scrutinizing the infrastructure and auditing the\ninformation needs and challenges of users, this research will illuminate the\ngaps that are leading to a lack of sustainable economic development, and\ninformation asymmetries discouraging the rural micro-entrepreneurs from selling\nonline.

    "abstract": "Deep generative approaches have recently made considerable progress in image\ninpainting by introducing structure priors. Due to the lack of proper\ninteraction with image texture during structure reconstruction, however,\ncurrent solutions are incompetent in handling the cases with large corruptions,\nand they generally suffer from distorted results.

Furthermore, to enhance the global consistency, a\nBi-directional Gated Feature Fusion (Bi-GFF) module is designed to exchange and\ncombine the structure and texture information and a Contextual Feature\nAggregation (CFA) module is developed to refine the generated contents by\nregion affinity learning and multi-scale feature aggregation.

    "abstract": "Climate change is affecting every known society, especially for small farmers\nin Low-Income Countries because they depend heavily on rain, seasonality\npatterns, and known temperature ranges. To build climate change resilient\ncommunities among rural farmers, the first step is to understand the impact of\nclimate change on the population. This paper proposes a Climate Change\nVulnerability Assessment Framework (CCVAF) to assess climate change\nvulnerabilities among rural farmers. The CCVAF framework uses information and\ncommunication technology (ICT) to assess climate change vulnerabilities among\nrural farmers by integrating both community level and individual household\nlevel indicators. The CCVAF was instantiated into a GIS-based web application\nnamed THRIVE for different decision-makers to better assess how climate change\nis affecting rural farmers in Western Honduras. Qualitative evaluation of the\nTHRIVE showed that it is an innovative and useful tool. The CCVAF contributes\nto not only the knowledge base of the climate change vulnerability assessment\nbut also the design science literature by providing guidelines to design a\nclass of climate change vulnerability assessment solutions.",

Primary schools in South Africa were forced to shift to emergency\nremote teaching abruptly relying on using a Learning Management System (LMS) to\naid their teaching. LMSs helped primary schools build resilience to cope with\nunexpected events. An opportunity rose to study the affordances and constraints\nfaced when using a LMS for remote teaching, specifically for primary school\nlearners ('Gen Z') - a largely ignored area of research. Through a case study\nof 6 schools, this research describes the affordances and constraints of the\nLMS supported teaching system in use in primary schools. Affordances related to\nschools, learners and teachers while constraints were classified from a\nfinancial, technological, school, learner and teacher perspective. Noteworthy\naffordances included using LMSs as notice boards and satisfying parents, the\nkey stakeholders. In terms of constraints, the digital divide was a recurring\ntheme while device and data costs were consistently a limitation. There were\nmany cases of schools not realizing the full potential of LMS usage. This\nresearch should be useful for primary schools wanting to use a LMS for their\nteaching.",

    "abstract": "Using the primary data collected for 463 farmers in six districts of Haryana,\nIndia, the present study attempts to understand the constituents of farmer's\nadaptive capacity at local level and how it can be enhanced. We use path\nanalysis technique using the lavaan package in RStudio to empirically test the\nrole of information. We find that information is a direct and significant\ncontributor to enhancing farmers' adaptive capacity. However, even with\nexponential growth in use of technology, particularly information and\ncommunication technologies (ICTs), small farmers still lack access to\ninformation which hinders their capacity to respond to weather and climate\nrisks. Thus, understanding the mechanism that can facilitate exchange and use\nof information by the farming community more effectively is important. We take\nan ensemble view of ICTs operationalized using ICT ecosystem and find\nsignificant interlinkages between information, technology and the ICT ecosystem\nthat facilitate learning and information exchange and therefore contribute to\nenhancing farmers' adaptive capacity and building resilience to climate shocks.\nWe find that ICT ecosystem does facilitate access to information and also\nmediate the effect of farmer's capability and willingness to use ICTs for\nagricultural purposes. Development of sound ICT ecosystem is likely to help\nfarmers to better respond to changing climate in the future.",

    "abstract": "We study efficient algorithms for reinforcement learning in Markov decision\nprocesses whose complexity is independent of the number of states. This\nformulation succinctly captures large scale problems, but is also known to be\ncomputationally hard in its general form. Previous approaches attempt to\ncircumvent the computational hardness by assuming structure in either\ntransition function or the value function, or by relaxing the solution\nguarantee to a local optimality condition.\nWe consider the methodology of boosting, borrowed from supervised learning,\nfor converting weak learners into an accurate policy. The notion of weak\nlearning we study is that of sampled-based approximate optimization of linear\nfunctions over policies. Under this assumption of weak learnability, we give an\nefficient algorithm that is capable of improving the accuracy of such weak\nlearning methods, till global optimality is reached. We prove sample complexity\nand running time bounds on our method, that are polynomial in the natural\nparameters of the problem: approximation guarantee, discount factor,\ndistribution mismatch and number of actions. In particular, our bound does not\ndepend on the number of states.\nA technical difficulty in applying previous boosting results, is that the\nvalue function over policy space is not convex. We show how to use a non-convex\nvariant of the Frank-Wolfe method, coupled with recent advances in gradient\nboosting that allow incorporating a weak learner with multiplicative\napproximation guarantee, to overcome the non-convexity and attain global\nconvergence.",

Consequently, using\na boundary resources model and platform governance approaches, this paper aims\nto examine how a payment platform facilitates ecosystem value co-creation with\nthird party actors. An in-depth qualitative inquiry was adopted for the study\nusing an embedded single-case design. The results show that although ecosystem\nvalue co-creation was enabled by the introduction of boundary resources tools,\nsome platform governance practices hindered some complementors from harnessing\nthe affordances of the platforms. These constraints include lack of visibility\nof the boundary resources and transparency challenges in the acceptance\ncriteria.

To\nillustrate the framework, while simultaneously addressing the highest thematic\nresearch gap among post-2015 ICT4D research priorities, the study collected\nprimary data from users of Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) Solar Home Systems who reside\nin rural Kenya. Using the framework, the study revealed that the ICT-artefact\ncan holistically be conceptualised within three of CA's concepts: under\nmaterial resources as a capability input; as a new category of conversion\nfactors (technological conversion factors); and as a component within the\nstructural context. The study further demonstrated how the same ICT artefact\ncould play out in the three different conceptualisations, resulting in\ndifferent development outcomes for individuals. The study finally presents the\nimplications for policy and practice.",

This paper tracks\nhow the IPR originally came to be held outside Kenya, and the implications for\nunderstanding M-Pesa as an inclusive innovation. Through reflection of this\nanalysis of IPR and innovation, the paper contributes to discussions on\nstructural aspects of digital innovation in the global south.

    "abstract": "Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have increasingly become\nvital for people on the move including the nearly 80 million displaced due to\nconflict, violence, and human right violations globally. However, existing\nresearch on ICTs and migrants, which almost entirely focused on migrants' ICT\nuse 'en route' or within developed economies principally in the perspectives of\nresearchers from these regions, is very fragmented posing a difficulty in\nunderstanding the key objects of research. Moreover, ICTs are often celebrated\nas liberating and exploitable at migrants' rational discretion even though they\nare 'double-edged swords' with significant risks, burdens, pressures and\ninequality challenges particularly for vulnerable migrants including those\nforcefully displaced and trafficked. Towards addressing these limitations and\nilluminating future directions, this paper, first, scrutinises the existing\nresearch vis-a-vis ICTs' liberating and authoritarian role particularly for\nvulnerable migrants whereby explicating key issues in the research domain.\nSecond, it identifies key gaps and opportunities for future research. Using a\ntailored methodology, broad literature relating to ICTs and\nmigration/development published in the period 1990-2020 was surveyed resulting\nin 157 selected publications which were critically appraised vis-a-vis the key\nthemes, major technologies dealt with, and methodologies and theories/concepts\nadopted. Furthermore, key insights, trends, gaps, and future research\nopportunities pertaining to both the existing and missing objects of research\nin ICTs and migration/development are spotlighted.",

    "abstract": "The connection between digital and inequality has traditionally been\nunderstood in terms of the digital divide or of forms of digital inequality\nwhose core conceptualisation is exclusion. This paper argues that, as the\nglobal South moves into a digital development paradigm of growing breadth and\ndepth of digital engagement, an exclusion worldview is no longer sufficient.\nDrawing from ideas in the development studies literature on chronic poverty,\nthe paper argues the need for a new concept: \"adverse digital incorporation\",\nmeaning inclusion in a digital system that enables a more-advantaged group to\nextract disproportionate value from the work or resources of another,\nless-advantaged group. This explains why inequality persists - even grows - in\na digital development paradigm. To help ground future research and practice on\nthis issue, the paper inductively builds a conceptual model of adverse digital\nincorporation with three main component sets: the processes, the drivers, and\nthe causes of adverse digital incorporation. The paper concludes with thoughts\non a future research and practice agenda that seeks to deliver digital justice\nin the global South: a necessary reconfiguration of the broader components of\npower that currently shape the inclusionary connection between digital and\ninequality.",

    "abstract": "Despite the significance of user engagement for efficacy of mobile health\n(mHealth) in the Global South, many such interventions do not include\nuser-engaging attributes. This is because socio-technical aspects are\nfrequently not considered during the design, development, and implementation,\nstages of such initiatives. In addition, there is little discussion in the\nliterature about the role socio-technical factors play in user-centered design\nprocesses for mHealth. This research posits consideration of socio-technical\nfactors is required as techno-centric approaches to mHealth design and user\nengagement, as well as those relying on existing universal frameworks for\nuser-centered design, have proven to be ineffective with the result that most\nmHealth projects in the Global South fail to sustain. This research examines\nprojects in Sierra Leone where semi-structured interviews were conducted with\nmHealth designers and developers in order to explore their attitudes towards\nuser engagement in this case. Barriers and facilitators to user engagement were\nidentified and classified as either technical or socio-technical. Findings from\nthe study indicate that adoption of a techno-centric approach without\nconsideration of socio-technical factors can negatively affect user's\nengagement. Based on these findings, we propose to develop a new design\nframework for more effective inclusion of user-engaging attributes in mHealth.",

Therefore, this study investigated the\nfactors affecting the adoption of ICT enabled services by rural entrepreneurs.\nThe study applied a cross-sectional survey of 77 respondents comprising 14\nrural entrepreneurs and 63 rural community members from four sites. It was\nfound that the five main factors affecting the adoption of digital services by\nrural entrepreneurs are a lack of awareness of digital services, electricity,\nskills to navigate smart devices, high cost of both devices and mobile internet\nand cybercrime. We recommend a tailor-made training program for rural\nentrepreneurs which includes raising awareness of digital services and\nassociated benefits, capacity building on digital skills and best practice for\ncybersecurity. In addition, we propose that the Namibian Government should\nenhance digital inclusion through a policy initiative to reduce the cost to\nmake both data and smart devices affordable for the poor and rural communities.",

The motivation behind the research is to develop such a robot that is\ncapable of performing disinfection tasks without the use of harmful sprays and\nchemicals that can leave residues and require airing the room afterward for a\nlong time. UltraBot technology has the potential to offer the most optimal\nautonomous disinfection performance along with taking care of people, keeping\nthem from getting under the UV-C radiation. The paper highlights UltraBot's\nmechanical and electrical design as well as disinfection performance. The\nconducted experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of robot disinfection\nability and actual disinfection area per each side with UV-C lamp array. The\ndisinfection effectiveness results show actual performance for the multi-pass\ntechnique that provides 1-log reduction with combined direct UV-C exposure and\nozone-based air purification after two robot passes at a speed of 0.14 m/s.\nThis technique has the same performance as ten minutes static disinfection.\nFinally, we have calculated the non-trivial form of the robot disinfection zone\nby two consecutive experiment to produce optimal path planning and to provide\nfull disinfection in selected areas.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a self-supervised Learning from Learned Hallucination\n(LfLH) method to learn fast and reactive motion planners for ground and aerial\nrobots to navigate through highly constrained environments. The recent Learning\nfrom Hallucination (LfH) paradigm for autonomous navigation executes motion\nplans by random exploration in completely safe obstacle-free spaces, uses\nhand-crafted hallucination techniques to add imaginary obstacles to the robot's\nperception, and then learns motion planners to navigate in realistic,\nhighly-constrained, dangerous spaces. However, current hand-crafted\nhallucination techniques need to be tailored for specific robot types (e.g., a\ndifferential drive ground vehicle), and use approximations heavily dependent on\ncertain assumptions (e.g., a short planning horizon). In this work, instead of\nmanually designing hallucination functions, LfLH learns to hallucinate obstacle\nconfigurations, where the motion plans from random exploration in open space\nare optimal, in a self-supervised manner. LfLH is robust to different robot\ntypes and does not make assumptions about the planning horizon. Evaluated in\nboth simulated and physical environments with a ground and an aerial robot,\nLfLH outperforms or performs comparably to previous hallucination approaches,\nalong with sampling- and optimization-based classical methods.",

In wind power production, error in forecasting production\nis impossible to negate owing to the intermittence of wind. For successful\npower grid integration, it is crucial to understand the uncertainties that\narise in predicting wind power production and use this information to build an\naccurate and reliable forecast. This can be achieved by observing the\nfluctuations in wind power production with changes in different parameters such\nas wind speed, temperature, and wind direction, and deriving functional\ndependencies for the same. Using optimized machine learning algorithms, it is\npossible to find obscured patterns in the observations and obtain meaningful\ndata, which can then be used to accurately predict wind power requirements .\nUtilizing the required data provided by the Gamesa's wind farm at Bableshwar,\nthe paper explores the use of both parametric and the non-parametric models for\ncalculating wind power prediction using power curves. The obtained results are\nsubject to comparison to better understand the accuracy of the utilized models\nand to determine the most suitable model for predicting wind power production\nbased on the given data set.",

The number of coarse labels required depends polynomially on the\ninformation distortion due to coarsening and the number of fine labels\n$|\\mathcal{Z}|$.\nWe also investigate the case of (infinitely many) real valued labels focusing\non a central problem in censored and truncated statistics: Gaussian mean\nestimation from coarse data.

About 67 women participated in the survey questionnaire. The\nstudy utilised Technology Facilitated Gender-Based Violence Framework as\ntheoretical lens. The study noted that women experienced various forms of cyber\nviolence such as cyber bullying, cyber harassment, online defamation,\ncyberstalking, sexual exploitation, online hate speech, and revenge\npornography. Perpetrators used digital platforms such Facebook, WhatsApp,\nonline personal accounts, dating sites, and smartphones to carry out their evil\nacts. The study also found that perpetrators' motivations were driven by\nrevenge, anger, jealousy, sexual desire and political agenda, with the\nintentions to harm the victims socially, psychologically, economically, and\nphysically. The women used coping measures such as confrontation and blocking\nthe perpetrator or by leaving the online platform. It was found that women\nnever bothered to report the incidences to the police or community to seek for\nsupport due to lack of awareness, cultural and patriarchal factors. In\nconclusion, the study found that the prevalence of cyber violence against women\nis rising significantly in Malawi. Therefore, the findings provide insights to\npolicy makers and research practioners on how to implement strategies for\ncombating cyber violence against women in the country.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the impacts of ICTs on livelihoods of women\nmicroenterprises in Malawi. The study was an interpretive qualitative approach\nin which semi-structured interviews, observation and field notes were used to\ncollect data. About 25 women involved in various microenterprises in three\nrural areas of Karonga district in Malawi were purposively selected to\nparticipate in the study. The framework for the study was based on Serrat's\nsustainable livelihood approach. The study noted that the use of ICTs\npotentially enabled women microenterprises to build their financial, human,\nsocial, and informational capital assets. The study found that ICTs to some\nextent contributed to the livelihoods of women microenterprises such as\nimproved access to information; diversification of business opportunities,\nimproved communication, improved marketing, and reduced transport costs. As a\nresult, this led to sustainable use of resources, improved well-being, and\nempowerment for women. However, unreliable electricity; lack of affordable ICT\ndevices; lack of awareness to utilise ICTs in businesses and lack of ICT\nliteracy skills were major concerns that affected women microenterprises. The\nstudy offers insights to research practioners, policy makers and other\nstakeholders on the role of ICTs in fostering women microentrepreneurship in\nrural communities of Malawi.",

    "abstract": "A number of studies in Information and Communication Technologies for\nDevelopment (ICT4D) focus on projects' sustainability and resilience. Over the\nyears, scholars have identified many elements to enable achievement of these\ngoals. Nevertheless, barriers to achieving them are still a common reality in\nthe field. In this paper, we propose that special attention should be paid to\ncommunities' relationships, self-organizing, and social capital - and the\npeople's networks that enable them - within ICT4D scholarship and practice, as\na way to achieve sustainability and resilience. Building on Green's work (2016)\non social change as a force that cannot be understood without focusing on\nsystems and power, we claim that ICT4D would benefit from intentionally growing\nsocial capital and fostering networks within its systems. We propose \"network\nweaving\" (Holley, 2013) as a practical approach, and we explore its potential\nto complement and advance existing ICT4D frameworks and practices, including\nthe sense of community of the researchers themselves.",

There is lack\nof coordinated information and knowledge in natural disaster and emergency\nsituations in Zimbabwe. This results in weak collaboration links among the\nvarious organizations that respond to emergencies, leading to slow decision\nmaking processes and long response times. This negatively affects the affected\ncommunities, exacerbating poverty in Zimbabwe.

To address this, the\nresearch seeks to develop an integrated Knowledge Management and ICT framework\nthat aid in coordination and collaboration among the various crisis responders.\nThis will be achieved through a case study approach using Zimbabwe's Civil\nProtection Unit. PAR within DSRM will be used to gather data from CPU as well\nas with NGO respondents, traditional leaders and disaster response experts.\nFindings will be compared and contrasted with secondary data gathered in\nliterature, this, with collected data will be used in developing a home grown\ncoordination and collaboration solution.

An intelligent network of connected devices\nthat collect data with their sensors and transmit them using cloud technologies\nin order to communicate with other assets in the ecosystem plays a pivotal role\nin this framework. Maximizing the quality of life of citizens, making better\nuse of resources, cutting costs, and improving sustainability are the ultimate\ngoals that a smart city is after. Hence, data collected from connected devices\nwill continuously get thoroughly analyzed to gain better insights into the\nservices that are being offered across the city; with this goal in mind that\nthey can be used to make the whole system more efficient. Robots and physical\nmachines are inseparable parts of a smart city. Embodied AI is the field of\nstudy that takes a deeper look into these and explores how they can fit into\nreal-world environments. It focuses on learning through interaction with the\nsurrounding environment, as opposed to Internet AI which tries to learn from\nstatic datasets. Embodied AI aims to train an agent that can See (Computer\nVision), Talk (NLP), Navigate and Interact with its environment (Reinforcement\nLearning), and Reason (General Intelligence), all at the same time. Autonomous\ndriving cars and personal companions are some of the examples that benefit from\nEmbodied AI nowadays. In this paper, we attempt to do a concise review of this\nfield. We will go through its definitions, its characteristics, and its current\nachievements along with different algorithms, approaches, and solutions that\nare being used in different components of it (e.g. Vision, NLP, RL). We will\nthen explore all the available simulators and 3D interactable databases that\nwill make the research in this area feasible.

In this thesis, we\nstudy and develop the stochastic Markov reward model (sMRM) which extends the\nMarkov chain with rewards as random variables. The model recently being\nintroduced, does not have much in the way of techniques and algorithms for\ntheir analysis. The purpose of this study is to derive such algorithms that are\nboth scalable and accurate.\nAdditionally, we derive the necessary theory for probabilistic model-checking\nof sMRMs against existing temporal logics such as PRCTL. We present the\nequations for computing \\textit{first-passage reward densities},\n\\textit{expected value problems}, and other \\textit{reachability problems}. Our\nfocus however is on finding strictly numerical solutions for\n\\textit{first-passage reward densities}. We solve for these by firstly adapting\nknown direct linear algebra algorithms such as Gaussian elimination, and\niterative methods such as the power method, Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel. We provide\nsolutions for both discrete-reward sMRMs, where all rewards discrete (lattice)\nrandom variables. And also for continuous-reward sMRMs, where all rewards are\nstrictly continuous random variables, but not necessarily having continuous\nprobability density functions (pdfs). Our solutions involve the use of fast\nFourier transform (FFT) for faster computation, and we adapted existing\nquadrature rules for convolution to gain more accurate solutions, rules such as\nthe trapezoid rule, Simpson's rule or Romberg's method.",

    "abstract": "Over the last few decades, Gyro-Free IMUs have been extensively researched to\novercome the limitations of gyroscopes. This research presents a Non-coplanar\nAccelerometer Array (NAA) for estimating angular velocity with non-specific\ngeometric arrangement of four or more triaxial accelerometers with\nnon-coplanarity constraint. The presented proof of non-coplanar spacial\narrangement also provides insights into propagation of the sensor noise and\nconstruction of the noise covariance matrices. The system noise depends on the\nsingular values of the relative displacement matrix (between the sensors). A\ndynamical system model with uncorrelated process and measurement noise is\nproposed where the accelerometer readings are used simultaneously as process\nand measurement inputs. The angular velocity is estimated using an EKF that\ndiscretizes and linearizes the continuous-discrete time dynamical system. The\nsimulations are performed on a Cube-NAA (Cu-NAA) comprising four accelerometers\nplaced at different vertices of a cube. They analyze the estimation error for\nstatic and dynamic movement as the distance between the accelerometers is\nvaried. Here, the system noise is observed to decrease inversely with the\nlength of the cube edge as the arrangement is kept identical. Consequently, the\nsimulation results indicate asymptotic decrease in the standard error of\nestimation with edge length. The experiments are conducted on a Cu-NAA with\nfive reflective optical markers. The reflective markers are visually tracked\nusing VICON to construct the ground truth. This unique experimental setup,\napart from providing three degrees of rotational freedom of movement, also\nallows for three degrees of spacial translation (linear acceleration of the\nCu-NAA in space). The simulation and experimental results indicate better\nperformance of the proposed EKF as compared to one with correlated process and\nmeasurement noises.",

However,\nprior work has shown that such requirements can be expensive, taking several\nweeks to label thousands of commits, and not always available when traversing\nnew research problems and domains. Unsupervised Learning is a promising\ndirection to learn hidden patterns within unlabelled data, which has only been\nextensively studied in defect prediction. Nevertheless, unsupervised learning\ncan be ineffective by itself and has not been explored in other domains (e.g.,\nstatic analysis and issue close time).\nMotivated by this literature gap and technical limitations, we present\nFRUGAL, a tuned semi-supervised method that builds on a simple optimization\nscheme that does not require sophisticated (e.g., deep learners) and expensive\n(e.g., 100% manually labelled data) methods. FRUGAL optimizes the unsupervised\nlearner's configurations (via a simple grid search) while validating our design\ndecision of labelling just 2.5% of the data before prediction.\nAs shown by the experiments of this paper FRUGAL outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art adoptable static code warning recognizer and issue closed time\npredictor, while reducing the cost of labelling by a factor of 40 (from 100% to\n2.5%). Hence we assert that FRUGAL can save considerable effort in data\nlabelling especially in validating prior work or researching new problems.\nBased on this work, we suggest that proponents of complex and expensive\nmethods should always baseline such methods against simpler and cheaper\nalternatives. For instance, a semi-supervised learner like FRUGAL can serve as\na baseline to the state-of-the-art software analytics.",

    "title": "Convex Latent Effect Logit Model via Sparse and Low-rank Decomposition",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a convex formulation for learning logistic\nregression model (logit) with latent heterogeneous effect on sub-population. In\ntransportation, logistic regression and its variants are often interpreted as\ndiscrete choice models under utility theory (McFadden, 2001). Two prominent\napplications of logit models in the transportation domain are traffic accident\nanalysis and choice modeling. In these applications, researchers often want to\nunderstand and capture the individual variation under the same accident or\nchoice scenario. The mixed effect logistic regression (mixed logit) is a\npopular model employed by transportation researchers. To estimate the\ndistribution of mixed logit parameters, a non-convex optimization problem with\nnested high-dimensional integrals needs to be solved. Simulation-based\noptimization is typically applied to solve the mixed logit parameter estimation\nproblem. Despite its popularity, the mixed logit approach for learning\nindividual heterogeneity has several downsides. First, the parametric form of\nthe distribution requires domain knowledge and assumptions imposed by users,\nalthough this issue can be addressed to some extent by using a non-parametric\napproach. Second, the optimization problems arise from parameter estimation for\nmixed logit and the non-parametric extensions are non-convex, which leads to\nunstable model interpretation. Third, the simulation size in\nsimulation-assisted estimation lacks finite-sample theoretical guarantees and\nis chosen somewhat arbitrarily in practice. To address these issues, we are\nmotivated to develop a formulation that models the latent individual\nheterogeneity while preserving convexity, and avoids the need for\nsimulation-based approximation. Our setup is based on decomposing the\nparameters into a sparse homogeneous component in the population and low-rank\nheterogeneous parts for each individual.",

The developed\napproach comprises of an ensemble of three novel ML algorithms namely; random\nforest (RF), extreme gradient boosted trees (ExGBT), and deep learning (DL).\nThese algorithms are trained to account for a wide collection of geometric\ncharacteristics and material properties, as well as loading conditions to\nexamine fire performance of normal and high strength RC columns by analyzing a\ncomprehensive database of fire tests comprising of over 494 observations. The\ndeveloped ensemble is also capable of presenting quantifiable insights to ML\npredictions; thus, breaking free from the notion of 'blackbox' ML and\nestablishing a solid step towards transparent and explainable ML. Most\nimportantly, this work tackles the scarcity of available fire tests by\nproposing new techniques to leverage the use of real, synthetic and augmented\nfire test observations. The developed ML ensemble has been calibrated and\nvalidated for standard and design fire exposures and for one, two, three and\nfour-sided fire exposures thus; covering a wide range of practical scenarios\npresent during fire incidents. When fully deployed, the developed ensemble can\nanalyze over 5,000 RC columns in under 60 seconds thus, providing an attractive\nsolution for researchers and practitioners.

To date, from the engineering\npoint of view, a large body of work has been devoted to studying how to\nmanipulate individual opinions so as to guide public opinion towards the\ndesired state. Recently, Abebe et al.

For the\nmodel, Chan et al. (The Web Conference 2019) designed a local search algorithm\nto find an optimal solution in polynomial time. However, it can be seen that\nthe solution obtained by solving the above model might not be implemented in\nreal-world scenarios. In fact, as we do not consider the amount of changes of\nthe susceptibility, it would be too costly to change the susceptibility values\nfor agents based on the solution.\nIn this paper, we study an opinion optimization model that is able to limit\nthe amount of changes of the susceptibility in various forms. First we\nintroduce a novel opinion optimization model, where the initial susceptibility\nvalues are given as additional input and the feasible region is defined using\nthe $\\ell_p$-ball centered at the initial susceptibility vector.

    "abstract": "Present-day federated learning (FL) systems deployed over edge networks have\nto consistently deal with a large number of workers with high degrees of\nheterogeneity in data and/or computing capabilities. This diverse set of\nworkers necessitates the development of FL algorithms that allow: (1) flexible\nworker participation that grants the workers' capability to engage in training\nat will, (2) varying number of local updates (based on computational resources)\nat each worker along with asynchronous communication with the server, and (3)\nheterogeneous data across workers. To address these challenges, in this work,\nwe propose a new paradigm in FL called ``Anarchic Federated Learning'' (AFL).\nIn stark contrast to conventional FL models, each worker in AFL has complete\nfreedom to choose i) when to participate in FL, and ii) the number of local\nsteps to perform in each round based on its current situation (e.g., battery\nlevel, communication channels, privacy concerns). However, AFL also introduces\nsignificant challenges in algorithmic design because the server needs to handle\nthe chaotic worker behaviors. Toward this end, we propose two Anarchic\nFedAvg-like algorithms with two-sided learning rates for both cross-device and\ncross-silo settings, which are named AFedAvg-TSLR-CD and AFedAvg-TSLR-CS,\nrespectively. For general worker information arrival processes, we show that\nboth algorithms retain the highly desirable linear speedup effect in the new\nAFL paradigm. Moreover, we show that our AFedAvg-TSLR algorithmic framework can\nbe viewed as a {\\em meta-algorithm} for AFL in the sense that they can utilize\nadvanced FL algorithms as worker- and/or server-side optimizers to achieve\nenhanced performance under AFL.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection from graph data has drawn much attention due to its\npractical significance in many critical applications including cybersecurity,\nfinance, and social networks. Existing data mining and machine learning methods\nare either shallow methods that could not effectively capture the complex\ninterdependency of graph data or graph autoencoder methods that could not fully\nexploit the contextual information as supervision signals for effective anomaly\ndetection. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel\nmethod, Self-Supervised Learning for Graph Anomaly Detection (SL-GAD). Our\nmethod constructs different contextual subgraphs (views) based on a target node\nand employs two modules, generative attribute regression and multi-view\ncontrastive learning for anomaly detection. While the generative attribute\nregression module allows us to capture the anomalies in the attribute space,\nthe multi-view contrastive learning module can exploit richer structure\ninformation from multiple subgraphs, thus abling to capture the anomalies in\nthe structure space, mixing of structure, and attribute information. We conduct\nextensive experiments on six benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses weakly supervised amodal instance segmentation, where\nthe goal is to segment both visible and occluded (amodal) object parts, while\ntraining provides only ground-truth visible (modal) segmentations. Following\nprior work, we use data manipulation to generate occlusions in training images\nand thus train a segmenter to predict amodal segmentations of the manipulated\ndata. The resulting predictions on training images are taken as the\npseudo-ground truth for the standard training of Mask-RCNN, which we use for\namodal instance segmentation of test images. For generating the pseudo-ground\ntruth, we specify a new Amodal Segmenter based on Boundary Uncertainty\nestimation (ASBU) and make two contributions. First, while prior work uses the\noccluder's mask, our ASBU uses the occlusion boundary as input. Second, ASBU\nestimates an uncertainty map of the prediction. The estimated uncertainty\nregularizes learning such that lower segmentation loss is incurred on regions\nwith high uncertainty. ASBU achieves significant performance improvement\nrelative to the state of the art on the COCOA and KINS datasets in three tasks:\namodal instance segmentation, amodal completion, and ordering recovery.",

The\nproblem of photo-sketch matching is challenging because 1) there is large\nmodality gap between photo and sketch, and 2) the number of paired training\nsamples is insufficient to train deep learning based networks. To circumvent\nthe problem of large modality gap, our approach is to use an intermediate\nlatent space between the two modalities. We effectively align the distributions\nof the two modalities in this latent space by employing a bidirectional (photo\n-> sketch and sketch -> photo) collaborative synthesis network. A StyleGAN-like\narchitecture is utilized to make the intermediate latent space be equipped with\nrich representation power. To resolve the problem of insufficient training\nsamples, we introduce a three-step training scheme.

    "abstract": "This paper provides an exponential stability result for the adaptive\nanti-unwinding attitude tracking control problem of a rigid body with uncertain\nbut constant inertia parameters, without requiring the satisfaction of\npersistent excitation (PE) condition. Specifically, a composite immersion and\ninvariance (I&I) adaptive controller is derived by integrating a\nprediction-error-driven learning law into the dynamically scaled I&I adaptive\ncontrol framework, wherein we modify the scaling factor so that the algorithm\ndesign does not involve any dynamic gains. To avoid the unwinding problem, a\nbarrier function is introduced as the attitude error function, along with the\ntactful establishment of two crucial algebra properties for exponential\nstability analysis. The regressor filtering method is adopted in combination\nwith the dynamic regressor extension and mixing (DREM) procedure to acquire the\nprediction error using only easily obtainable signals. In particular, aiding by\na constructive liner time-varying filter, the scalar regressor of DREM is\nextended to generate a new exciting counterpart. In this way, the derived\ncontroller is shown to permit closed-loop exponential stability without PE, in\nthe sense that both output-tracking and parameter estimation errors\nexponentially converge to zero. Further, the composite learning law is\naugmented with a power term to achieve synchronized finite/fixed-time parameter\nconvergence. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the theoretical\nfindings.",

To address this gap in the\nliterature, we leverage the mature social construct of incivility as a lens to\nunderstand confrontational conflicts in open source code review discussions.\nFor that, we conducted a qualitative analysis on 1,545 emails from the Linux\nKernel Mailing List (LKML) that were associated with rejected changes.

    "abstract": "Much recent progress has been made in reconstructing the 3D shape of an\nobject from an image of it, i.e. single view 3D reconstruction. However, it has\nbeen suggested that current methods simply adopt a \"nearest-neighbor\" strategy,\ninstead of genuinely understanding the shape behind the input image. In this\npaper, we rigorously show that for many state of the art methods, this issue\nmanifests as (1) inconsistencies between coarse reconstructions and input\nimages, and (2) inability to generalize across domains. We thus propose REFINE,\na postprocessing mesh refinement step that can be easily integrated into the\npipeline of any black-box method in the literature. At test time, REFINE\noptimizes a network per mesh instance, to encourage consistency between the\nmesh and the given object view. This, along with a novel combination of\nregularizing losses, reduces the domain gap and achieves state of the art\nperformance. We believe that this novel paradigm is an important step towards\nrobust, accurate reconstructions, remaining relevant as new reconstruction\nnetworks are introduced.",

Manifold learning algorithms can discover a much\nlower-dimensional representation (embedding) of a high-dimensional dataset\nthrough non-linear transformations that preserve the most important structure\nof the original data. State-of-the-art manifold learning methods directly\noptimise an embedding without mapping between the original space and the\ndiscovered embedded space.

Recently, genetic programming\nhas emerged as a very promising approach to manifold learning by evolving\nfunctional mappings from the original space to an embedding. However, genetic\nprogramming-based manifold learning has struggled to match the performance of\nother approaches. In this work, we propose a new approach to using genetic\nprogramming for manifold learning, which preserves local topology. This is\nexpected to significantly improve performance on tasks where local\nneighbourhood structure (topology) is paramount. We compare our proposed\napproach with various baseline manifold learning methods and find that it often\noutperforms other methods, including a clear improvement over previous genetic\nprogramming approaches.

No samples are useless totally, and not samples are 100% perfect. This\ncharacteristic means that it is not suitable just to remove some samples or\nkeep some samples. It is necessary to consider the sample transformation for\nobtaining high quality new samples. Unfortunately, existing PD speech\nrecognition methods focus mainly on feature learning and classifier design\nrather than sample learning, and few methods consider the sample\ntransformation. To solve the problem above, a PD speech sample transformation\nalgorithm based on multitype reconstruction operators is proposed in this\npaper. The algorithm is divided into four major steps. Three types of\nreconstruction operators are designed in the algorithm: types A, B and C.\nConcerning the type A operator, the original dataset is directly reconstructed\nby designing a linear transformation to obtain the first dataset. The type B\noperator is designed for clustering and linear transformation of the dataset to\nobtain the second new dataset. The third operator, namely, the type C operator,\nreconstructs the dataset by clustering and convolution to obtain the third\ndataset. Finally, the base classifier is trained based on the three new\ndatasets, and then the classification results are fused by decision weighting.\nIn the experimental section, two representative PD speech datasets are used for\nverification. The results show that the proposed algorithm is effective.\nCompared with other algorithms, the proposed algorithm achieves apparent\nimprovements in terms of classification accuracy.",

The effectiveness of\nthis technique is tested with various datasets and data augmentation settings.\nIn particular, we achieve performance gain by 3.2% in the iSarcasm dataset when\nusing data augmentation to increase 20% of data labeled as sarcastic, resulting\nF-score of 40.4% compared to 37.2% without data augmentation.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a strategy for training convolutional neural\nnetworks to effectively resolve interference arising from competing hypotheses\nrelating to inter-categorical information throughout the network. The premise\nis based on the notion of feature binding, which is defined as the process by\nwhich activations spread across space and layers in the network are\nsuccessfully integrated to arrive at a correct inference decision. In our work,\nthis is accomplished for the task of dense image labelling by blending images\nbased on (i) categorical clustering or (ii) the co-occurrence likelihood of\ncategories. We then train a feature binding network which simultaneously\nsegments and separates the blended images. Subsequent feature denoising to\nsuppress noisy activations reveals additional desirable properties and high\ndegrees of successful predictions. Through this process, we reveal a general\nmechanism, distinct from any prior methods, for boosting the performance of the\nbase segmentation and saliency network while simultaneously increasing\nrobustness to adversarial attacks.",

    "abstract": "In a clone node attack, an attacker attempted to physically capture the\ndevices to gather sensitive information to conduct various insider attacks.\nSeveral solutions for detecting clone node attacks on IoT networks have been\npresented in the viewpoints above. These solutions are focused on specific\nsystem designs, processes, and feature sets and act as a high-level abstraction\nof underlying system architectures based on a few performance requirements.\nHowever, critical features like formal analysis, modelling, and verification\nare frequently overlooked in existing proposed solutions aimed at verifying the\ncorrectness and robustness of systems in order to ensure that no problematic\nscenarios or anomalies exist. This paper presents a formal analysis, modelling,\nand verification of our existing proposed clone node attack detection scheme in\nIoT. Firstly, we modelled the architectural components of the proposed scheme\nusing High-Level Petri Nets (HLPNs) and then mapped them using their specified\nfunctionalities. Secondly, we defined and analysed the behavioural properties\nof the proposed scheme using Z specification language. Furthermore, we used the\nSatisfiability Modulo Theories Library (SMT-Lib) and the Z3 Solver to validate\nand demonstrate the overall functionality of the proposed scheme. Finally, in\naddition to modelling and analysis, this work employs Coloured Petri Nets\n(CPNs), which combine Petri Nets with a high-level programming language, making\nthem more suitable for large-scale system modelling. To perform the simulations\nin CPN, we used both timed and untimed models, where timed models are used to\nevaluate performance, and untimed models are used to validate logical validity.",

However, this access is complicated by social distancing\nrequirements that disrupt traditional in-person communication. Many refugees\nmust then rely on alternative information sources to stay informed. Differences\nin media types and information sources in turn may be related to anxieties\narising from the virus and perceptions of others' adherence to recommended\nprotective behaviors. We examine these relationships with survey data from\n1,000 refugees living in both camps and non-camp settings in Kenya. Using logit\nmodels, we test relationships between information source and anxiety and the\neffect of these variables on refugees' expected behaviors of community members.\nOur primary contributions include the finding that information sources\nconsistently exacerbate (e.g., Facebook) or ameliorate (e.g., news from the\ninternet) different anxieties, or can have mixed effects (e.g., radio). We also\nfind that anxiety and information have significant impacts on refugees'\nexpectations of compliance by others and that, whether between camps or between\ncamps and non-camp locales, findings vary by location. Our results have\nimplications for refugee media and infectious disease anxiety scholarship as\nwell as for managing infectious disease response.",

However, mobile payment usage in Malawi is low, and\nthere are many limitations to encourage users to continuously use mobile\npayments. The purpose of this research was to examine determinants of\ncontinuous intention to use mobile payments in Malawi. A conceptual framework\nadapted from Technology Acceptance Model was developed. Data was collected\nthrough a survey while data analysis used Structural Equation Modelling Partial\nLeast Squares using SmartPLS software. The findings of this study showed that\nsociety norms significantly influence continuous intention to use mobile\npayments (p=0.012).

The findings of this research\nprovide several considerations to guide the mobile payments industry in Malawi.\nThe findings may also improve the existing mobile payments system's business\nmodels, marketing strategies, customer engagement on security issues,\ntransparency, and interoperability of payment systems.

    "title": "The ICT-Buen Vivir Paradox: Using Digital Tools to Defend Indigenous  Cultures",
    "abstract": "Arguably shaped by political economy perspectives from the Global North,\nICT4D aims to reduce socioeconomic disparities across countries and regions\nthrough ICT implementations, as well as to open up opportunities for\nempowerment and human development. Despite these aims, ICT4D has been\ncriticized because 1) although ICT and internet have positive effects on\nsocieties across the Global North, their positive impact on people's lives in\nthe Global South cannot be easily proved; 2) ICT4D's primary focus seems to be\non ICT's series of artefacts rather than on ICT's positive transformative\npotential of living conditions in the world; 3) the type of development ICT4D\naims for could mask global hegemonic interests and seek neoliberal\nrestructuring within less socioeconomically favoured communities within the\nGlobal South. For these reasons, claim scholars, ICT4D should be revised. By\npresenting ICT appropriations among Wixarika peoples in Mexico to protect their\nsacred land, this paper aims to 1) shed a light on the need for postcolonial\ncritical frameworks on what 'development' associated with ICT should be and 2)\nto foster discussions on whether ICT can enable alternative voices from the\nGlobal South to be heard, despite tensions between traditional views and\ncontemporary technologies.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes is a global health problem with a high mortality rate. The research\nindicates low levels of technology use amongst diabetic patients in low\nsocioeconomic environments and minority groups. We posit that the culture of\npatients is a potential reason for the low adoption and use of technology.\nHowever, research on the proliferation of culture at an individual level is\nlimited. Therefore, this paper assessed the influence of culture on mobile\napplication adoption and use amongst diabetic patients in the Cape Flats, South\nAfrica. This study used key constructs from the Theory of Planned Behaviour\n(TPB) and Hofstede's cultural dimensions. It was analysed using survey data\nfrom 439 respondents using purposive sampling. It was found that the dimensions\nof Hofstede and the Theory of Planned Behaviour can identify how culture\ninfluences mobile application adoption of diabetic patients in the geographical\nCape Flats area. However, this research indicates a stronger relationship\nbetween culture and diabetes self-management activities than culture and the\nadoption of mobile applications.",

This research was aimed at exploring the moderating effect of\ngender on the adoption of a digital government innovation in Ethiopia based on\nthe UTAUT model (n=270) and using structural equation modeling (SEM). The\nresults reveal that gender only moderates the relationship between facilitating\nconditions and usage behavior of government employees to adopt the digital\ngovernment innovation which is inconsistent with other findings. Another key\nfinding was that even though the innovation was regarded as not being easy to\nuse, women identified that they would still use it because of the social\ninfluence from the peers and the bosses. This finding suggests that women\ngovernment employees who obtain external support are more likely to use digital\ngovernment innovations compared with men who are unlikely to use it even if\nthey were facilitated. The paper recommends that governments of low-income\ncountries like Ethiopia should design appropriate policies that encourage women\nin digital government.",

In this work, we introduce a novel\nneural surface reconstruction framework that leverages the knowledge of stereo\nmatching and feature consistency to optimize the implicit surface\nrepresentation. More specifically, we apply a signed distance field (SDF) and a\nsurface light field to represent the scene geometry and appearance\nrespectively. The SDF is directly supervised by geometry from stereo matching,\nand is refined by optimizing the multi-view feature consistency and the\nfidelity of rendered images. Our method is able to improve the robustness of\ngeometry estimation and support reconstruction of complex scene topologies.\nExtensive experiments have been conducted on DTU, EPFL and Tanks and Temples\ndatasets.

    "abstract": "An explicit discriminator trained on observable in-distribution (ID) samples\ncan make high-confidence prediction on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples due to\nits distributional vulnerability. This is primarily caused by the limited ID\nsamples observable for training discriminators when OOD samples are\nunavailable. To address this issue, the state-of-the-art methods train the\ndiscriminator with OOD samples generated by general assumptions without\nconsidering the data and network characteristics. However, different network\narchitectures and training ID datasets may cause diverse vulnerabilities, and\nthe generated OOD samples thus usually misaddress the specific distributional\nvulnerability of the explicit discriminator. To reveal and patch the\ndistributional vulnerabilities, we propose a novel method of\n\\textit{fine-tuning explicit discriminators by implicit generators} (FIG).\nAccording to the Shannon entropy, an explicit discriminator can construct its\ncorresponding implicit generator to generate specific OOD samples without extra\ntraining costs. A Langevin Dynamic sampler then draws high-quality OOD samples\nfrom the generator to reveal the vulnerability. Finally, a regularizer,\nconstructed according to the design principle of the implicit generator,\npatches the distributional vulnerability by encouraging those generated OOD\nsamples with high entropy. Our experiments on four networks, four ID datasets\nand seven OOD datasets demonstrate that FIG achieves state-of-the-art OOD\ndetection performance and maintains a competitive classification capability.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning has been widely used to train transformer-based\nvision-language models for video-text alignment and multi-modal representation\nlearning. This paper presents a new algorithm called Token-Aware Cascade\ncontrastive learning (TACo) that improves contrastive learning using two novel\ntechniques. The first is the token-aware contrastive loss which is computed by\ntaking into account the syntactic classes of words. This is motivated by the\nobservation that for a video-text pair, the content words in the text, such as\nnouns and verbs, are more likely to be aligned with the visual contents in the\nvideo than the function words. Second, a cascade sampling method is applied to\ngenerate a small set of hard negative examples for efficient loss estimation\nfor multi-modal fusion layers. To validate the effectiveness of TACo, in our\nexperiments we finetune pretrained models for a set of downstream tasks\nincluding text-video retrieval (YouCook2, MSR-VTT and ActivityNet), video\naction step localization (CrossTask), video action segmentation (COIN). The\nresults show that our models attain consistent improvements across different\nexperimental settings over previous methods, setting new state-of-the-art on\nthree public text-video retrieval benchmarks of YouCook2, MSR-VTT and\nActivityNet.",

    "abstract": "For the success of video deblurring, it is essential to utilize information\nfrom neighboring frames. Most state-of-the-art video deblurring methods adopt\nmotion compensation between video frames to aggregate information from multiple\nframes that can help deblur a target frame. However, the motion compensation\nmethods adopted by previous deblurring methods are not blur-invariant, and\nconsequently, their accuracy is limited for blurry frames with different blur\namounts. To alleviate this problem, we propose two novel approaches to deblur\nvideos by effectively aggregating information from multiple video frames.\nFirst, we present blur-invariant motion estimation learning to improve motion\nestimation accuracy between blurry frames. Second, for motion compensation,\ninstead of aligning frames by warping with estimated motions, we use a pixel\nvolume that contains candidate sharp pixels to resolve motion estimation\nerrors. We combine these two processes to propose an effective recurrent video\ndeblurring network that fully exploits deblurred previous frames.

In this work,\nwe propose an effective farsighted probabilistic sampling based local search\nalgorithm called FPS for solving these two problems, denoted as (W)PMS. The FPS\nalgorithm replaces the mechanism of flipping a single variable per iteration\nstep, that is widely used in existing (W)PMS local search algorithms, with the\nproposed farsighted local search strategy, and provides higher-quality local\noptimal solutions. The farsighted strategy employs the probabilistic sampling\ntechnique that allows the algorithm to look-ahead widely and efficiently. In\nthis way, FPS can provide more and better search directions and improve the\nperformance without reducing the efficiency. Extensive experiments on all the\nbenchmarks of (W)PMS problems from the incomplete track of recent four years of\nMaxSAT Evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms\nSATLike3.0, the state-of-the-art local search algorithm, for solving both the\nPMS and WPMS problems. We furthermore do comparison with the extended solver of\nSATLike, SATLike-c, which is the champion of three categories among the total\nfour (PMS and WPMS categories, each associated with two time limits) of the\nincomplete track in the recent MaxSAT Evaluation (MSE2021). We replace the\nlocal search component in SATLike-c with the proposed farsighted sampling local\nsearch approach, and the resulting solver FPS-c also outperforms SATLike-c for\nsolving both the PMS and WPMS problems.",

More precisely, a unit\nflow is injected into a set of input nodes and collected from a set of output\nnodes while minimizing the expected transportation cost together with a paths\nrelative entropy regularization term, providing a randomized routing policy.\nThe main advantage of this new formulation is the fact that it can easily\naccommodate edge flow capacity constraints which commonly occur in real-world\nproblems.

Although previous approaches pre-define the type of dataset bias\nto prevent the network from learning it, recognizing the bias type in the real\ndataset is often prohibitive. This paper proposes a novel bias-tailored\naugmentation-based approach, BiaSwap, for learning debiased representation\nwithout requiring supervision on the bias type. Assuming that the bias\ncorresponds to the easy-to-learn attributes, we sort the training images based\non how much a biased classifier can exploits them as shortcut and divide them\ninto bias-guiding and bias-contrary samples in an unsupervised manner.\nAfterwards, we integrate the style-transferring module of the image translation\nmodel with the class activation maps of such biased classifier, which enables\nto primarily transfer the bias attributes learned by the classifier. Therefore,\ngiven the pair of bias-guiding and bias-contrary, BiaSwap generates the\nbias-swapped image which contains the bias attributes from the bias-contrary\nimages, while preserving bias-irrelevant ones in the bias-guiding images. Given\nsuch augmented images, BiaSwap demonstrates the superiority in debiasing\nagainst the existing baselines over both synthetic and real-world datasets.\nEven without careful supervision on the bias, BiaSwap achieves a remarkable\nperformance on both unbiased and bias-guiding samples, implying the improved\ngeneralization capability of the model.",

Since they get their energy from photosynthesis, light\nis a key factor that strongly influences their productivity. Light is absorbed\nand scattered in the liquid medium, and irradiance exponentially decreases\ntowards the darkest part of the photobioreactor at a rate nonlinearly depending\non the biomass concentration. Maximizing productivity is then a tricky problem,\nespecially when the growth rate is inhibited by an excess of light.\nProductivity optimization turns out to be highly dependent on how light is\ndistributed along the reactor, and is therefore related to the extinction rate\nand the background turbidity. The concept of optical depth productivity is\nintroduced for systems where background turbidity must be accounted for and a\nglobal optimum maximizing productivity is proposed, extending the concept of\nthe compensation condition. This optimal condition consists in compensating the\nalgal growth rate at the bottom of the reactor by the respiration. This\ncondition can drive the optimization of the surface biomass productivity\ndepending on the minimum reachable depth.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial images,\nwhile their robustness in text classification is rarely studied. Several lines\nof text attack methods have been proposed in the literature, including\ncharacter-level, word-level, and sentence-level attacks. However, it is still a\nchallenge to minimize the number of word changes necessary to induce\nmisclassification, while simultaneously ensuring lexical correctness, syntactic\nsoundness, and semantic similarity. In this paper, we propose a Bigram and\nUnigram based adaptive Semantic Preservation Optimization (BU-SPO) method to\nexamine the vulnerability of deep models. Our method has four major merits.\nFirstly, we propose to attack text documents not only at the unigram word level\nbut also at the bigram level which better keeps semantics and avoids producing\nmeaningless outputs. Secondly, we propose a hybrid method to replace the input\nwords with options among both their synonyms candidates and sememe candidates,\nwhich greatly enriches the potential substitutions compared to only using\nsynonyms. Thirdly, we design an optimization algorithm, i.e., Semantic\nPreservation Optimization (SPO), to determine the priority of word\nreplacements, aiming to reduce the modification cost. Finally, we further\nimprove the SPO with a semantic Filter (named SPOF) to find the adversarial\nexample with the highest semantic similarity. We evaluate the effectiveness of\nour BU-SPO and BU-SPOF on IMDB, AG's News, and Yahoo! Answers text datasets by\nattacking four popular DNNs models. Results show that our methods achieve the\nhighest attack success rates and semantics rates by changing the smallest\nnumber of words compared with existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Event extraction (EE), which acquires structural event knowledge from texts,\ncan be divided into two sub-tasks: event type classification and element\nextraction (namely identifying triggers and arguments under different role\npatterns). As different event types always own distinct extraction schemas\n(i.e., role patterns), previous work on EE usually follows an isolated learning\nparadigm, performing element extraction independently for different event\ntypes. It ignores meaningful associations among event types and argument roles,\nleading to relatively poor performance for less frequent types/roles. This\npaper proposes a novel neural association framework for the EE task. Given a\ndocument, it first performs type classification via constructing a\ndocument-level graph to associate sentence nodes of different types, and\nadopting a graph attention network to learn sentence embeddings. Then, element\nextraction is achieved by building a universal schema of argument roles, with a\nparameter inheritance mechanism to enhance role preference for extracted\nelements. As such, our model takes into account type and role associations\nduring EE, enabling implicit information sharing among them. Experimental\nresults show that our approach consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art\nEE methods in both sub-tasks.

    "abstract": "Due to the rapid increase in the diversity of image data, the problem of\ndomain generalization has received increased attention recently. While domain\ngeneralization is a challenging problem, it has achieved great development\nthanks to the fast development of AI techniques in computer vision. Most of\nthese advanced algorithms are proposed with deep architectures based on\nconvolution neural nets (CNN). However, though CNNs have a strong ability to\nfind the discriminative features, they do a poor job of modeling the relations\nbetween different locations in the image due to the response to CNN filters are\nmostly local. Since these local and global spatial relationships are\ncharacterized to distinguish an object under consideration, they play a\ncritical role in improving the generalization ability against the domain gap.\nIn order to get the object parts relationships to gain better domain\ngeneralization, this work proposes to use the self attention model. However,\nthe attention models are proposed for sequence, which are not expert in\ndiscriminate feature extraction for 2D images. Considering this, we proposed a\nhybrid architecture to discover the spatial relationships between these local\nfeatures, and derive a composite representation that encodes both the\ndiscriminative features and their relationships to improve the domain\ngeneralization. Evaluation on three well-known benchmarks demonstrates the\nbenefits of modeling relationships between the features of an image using the\nproposed method and achieves state-of-the-art domain generalization\nperformance.

Whereas finetuning a downstream\ntask using supervised ImageNet pretrained features is straightforward and\nextensively investigated in many works, there is little study on the usefulness\nof self-supervised pretraining. In this paper, we assess the transferability of\nImageNet self-supervisedpretraining by evaluating the performance of models\ninitialized with pretrained features from three self-supervised techniques\n(SimCLR, SwAV, and DINO) on selected medical classification tasks. The chosen\ntasks cover tumor detection in sentinel axillary lymph node images, diabetic\nretinopathy classification in fundus images, and multiple pathological\ncondition classification in chest X-ray images. We demonstrate that\nself-supervised pretrained models yield richer embeddings than their supervised\ncounterpart, which benefits downstream tasks in view of both linear evaluation\nand finetuning. For example, in view of linear evaluation at acritically small\nsubset of the data, we see an improvement up to 14.79% in Kappa score in the\ndiabetic retinopathy classification task, 5.4% in AUC in the tumor\nclassification task, 7.03% AUC in the pneumonia detection, and 9.4% in AUC in\nthe detection of pathological conditions in chest X-ray. In addition, we\nintroduce Dynamic Visual Meta-Embedding (DVME) as an end-to-end transfer\nlearning approach that fuses pretrained embeddings from multiple models. We\nshow that the collective representation obtained by DVME leads to a significant\nimprovement in the performance of selected tasks compared to using a single\npretrained model approach and can be generalized to any combination of\npretrained models.",

    "abstract": "In the agricultural sector, the COVID-19 threatens to lead to a severe food\nsecurity crisis in the region, with disruptions in the food supply chain and\nagricultural production expected to contract between 2.6% and 7%. From the food\ncrop production side, the travel bans and border closures, the late reception\nand the use of agricultural inputs such as imported seeds, fertilizers, and\npesticides could lead to poor food crop production performances. Another layer\nof disruption introduced by the mobility restriction measures is the scarcity\nof agricultural workers, mainly seasonal workers. The lockdown measures and\nborder closures limit seasonal workers' availability to get to the farm on time\nfor planting and harvesting activities. Moreover, most of the imported\nagricultural inputs travel by air, which the pandemic has heavily impacted.\nSuch transportation disruptions can also negatively affect the food crop\nproduction system.\nThis chapter assesses food crop production levels in 2020 -- before the\nharvesting period -- in all African regions and four staples such as maize,\ncassava, rice, and wheat. The production levels are predicted using the\ncombination of biogeophysical remote sensing data retrieved from satellite\nimages and machine learning artificial neural networks (ANNs) technique. The\nremote sensing products are used as input variables and the ANNs as the\npredictive modeling framework. The input remote sensing products are the\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the daytime Land Surface\nTemperature (LST), rainfall data, and agricultural lands' Evapotranspiration\n(ET). The output maps and data are made publicly available on a web-based\nplatform, AAgWa (Africa Agriculture Watch, www.aagwa.org), to facilitate access\nto such information to policymakers, deciders, and other stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "In a hostile environment, interference identification plays an important role\nin protecting the authorized communication system and avoiding its performance\ndegradation. In this paper, the interference identification problem for the\nfrequency hopping communication system is discussed. Considering presence of\nmultiple and compound interference in the frequency hopping system, in order to\nfully extracted effective features of the interferences from the received\nsignals, a composite time-frequency analysis method based on both the linear\nand bilinear transform is proposed. The time-frequency spectrograms obtained\nfrom the time-frequency analysis are constructed as matching pairs and input\ninto the deep neural network for identification. In particular, the Siamese\nneural network is adopted as the classifier to perform the interference\nidentification. That is, the paired spectrograms are input into the two\nsub-networks of the Siamese neural network to extract the features of the\npaired spectrograms. The Siamese neural network is trained and tested by\ncalculating the gap between the generated features, and the interference type\nidentification is realized by the trained Siamese neural network. The\nsimulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm can obtain higher\nidentification accuracy than both traditional single time-frequency\nrepresentation based approach and the AlexNet transfer learning or\nconvolutional neural network based methods.",

Synthetic tabular data emerges as\nan alternative to enable data sharing while fulfilling regulatory and privacy\nconstraints. The state-of-the-art tabular data synthesizers draw methodologies\nfrom Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In this thesis, we develop\nCTAB-GAN, a novel conditional table GAN architecture that can effectively model\ndiverse data types with complex distributions. CTAB-GAN is extensively\nevaluated with the state of the art GANs that generate synthetic tables, in\nterms of data similarity and analysis utility. The results on five datasets\nshow that the synthetic data of CTAB-GAN remarkably resembles the real data for\nall three types of variables and results in higher accuracy for five machine\nlearning algorithms, by up to 17%.\nAdditionally, to ensure greater security for training tabular GANs against\nmalicious privacy attacks, differential privacy (DP) is studied and used to\ntrain CTAB-GAN with strict privacy guarantees. DP-CTAB-GAN is rigorously\nevaluated using state-of-the-art DP-tabular GANs in terms of data utility and\nprivacy robustness against membership and attribute inference attacks. Our\nresults on three datasets indicate that strict theoretical differential privacy\nguarantees come only after severely affecting data utility. However, it is\nshown empirically that these guarantees help provide a stronger defence against\nprivacy attacks. Overall, it is found that DP-CTABGAN is capable of being\nrobust to privacy attacks while maintaining the highest data utility as\ncompared to prior work, by up to 18% in terms of the average precision score.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are programs that are deployed and executed on the\nblockchain. Typically, smart contracts govern assets; popular smart contracts\ncan govern assets worth millions. Just like traditional programs, smart\ncontracts are subject to programming mistakes. However, a major difference is\nthat smart contracts cannot be patched once deployed. Several approaches have\nbeen studied to improve smart contract security, by detecting bugs prior to\ndeployment, allowing contracts to be updated, or modifying clients to prevent\nattacking transactions. The most elegant solution would be to automatically\neliminate bugs prior to deployment. Merely identifying bugs is not enough. This\nbecame evident when the Parity wallet was hacked a second time after being\nmanually patched following a security audit. Automatic pre-deployment patching\noffers a powerful promise to strengthen smart contract defenses. Current\napproaches are limited in the types of vulnerabilities that can be patched, in\nthe flexibility of the patching process, and in scalability. In this paper we\npropose Elysium, a scalable approach towards automatic smart contract repair,\nthat combines template-based patching with semantic patching by inferring\ncontext information from the bytecode. Elysium can currently automatically\npatch 7 known vulnerabilities in smart contracts using external bug-finding\ntools, and it can easily be extended with new templates and new bug-finding\ntools. We evaluate effectiveness and correctness of Elysium using 3 different\ndatasets by replaying more than 500K transactions against patched contracts. We\nfind that Elysium outperforms existing tools by patching at least 30% more\ncontracts. Finally, we compare the overhead in terms of deployment and\ntransaction cost increase. In comparison to other tools, Elysium minimizes\ntransaction cost (up to a factor of 1.9), for only a marginally higher\ndeployment cost.",

    "abstract": "As the world's population increases, so does the demand for food. This demand\nfor food in turn puts pressure on agriculture in many countries. The impact of\nclimate change on the environment has made it difficult to produce food that\nmay be necessary to accommodate the growing population. Due to these concerns,\nthe agriculture sector is forced to move towards more efficient and sustainable\nmethods of farming to increase productivity. There is evidence that the use of\ntechnology in agriculture has the potential to improve food production and food\nsustainability; thereby addressing the concerns of food security. The Internet\nof Things (IoT) has been suggested as a potential tool for farmers to overcome\nthe impact of climate change on food security. However, there is dearth of\nresearch on the readiness of implementing IoT in South Africa's agricultural\nsector. Therefore, this research aims to explore the readiness of the\nagricultural sector of South Africa for a wide implementation of IoT. This\nresearch conducts a desktop study through the lens of the PEST framework on the\nspecial case of South Africa. A thematic literature and documents review was\ndeployed to examine the political, economic, societal and technological factors\nthat may facilitate or impede the implementation of IoT in the agricultural\nsectors of South Africa.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to engage with the Information Systems' contexts\nof use as a means to explain nuanced human-technology interaction. In this\npaper, we specifically propose the conceptualisation of healthcare-seeking as\nan activity to offer a richer explanation of technology utilisation. This is an\ninterpretivist study drawing on Activity Theory to conceptualise\nhealthcare-seeking as the minimum context needed to explicate use. A framework\nof the core aspects of AT is used to analyse one empirical mHealth case from a\nKenyan context thus illustrating how AT can be applied to study technology use.\nThe paper explicates technology use by explaining various utilisation behaviour\nthat may emerge in a complex human-technology interaction context; ranging from\na complex adoption process to mechanisms to determine continuance that\ndifferentiate trust in the intervention from trust in the information, and\npotential technology coping strategies. The paper is a novel attempt to\noperationalise AT to study technology use. It thus offers a broader explication\nof use while providing insights for design and implementation made possible by\nthe conceptualisation of healthcare-seeking as an activity. Such insights may\nbe useful in the design of patient-centred systems.",

    "abstract": "Premised on the logic that more, high-quality information on majority world\nwomen's lives will improve the effectiveness of interventions addressing gender\ninequality, mainstream development institutions have invested heavily in gender\ndata initiatives of late. However, critical empirical and theoretical\ninvestigations into gender data for development policy and practice are\nlacking. Postcolonial feminist theory has long provided a critical lens through\nwhich to analyse international development projects that target women in the\nmajority world. However, postcolonial feminism remains underutilised for\ncritically investigating data for development projects. This paper addresses\nthese gaps through presenting the findings from a participatory action research\nproject with young women involved in a gender data for development project in\nBangladesh. Echoing postcolonial feminist concerns with development, the\n'DataGirls' had some concerns that data was being extracted from their\ncommunities, representing the priorities of external NGOs to a greater extent\nthan their own. However, through collaborating to develop and deliver community\nevents on child marriage with the 'DataGirls', this research demonstrates that\nparticipatory approaches can address some postcolonial feminist criticisms of\n(data for) development, by ensuring that gender data is enacted by and for\nmajority world women rather than Western development institutions.",

    "abstract": "Efficient channel state information at transmitter (CSIT) for frequency\ndivision duplex (FDD) massive MIMO can facilitate its backward compatibility\nwith existing FDD cellular networks. To date, several CSIT estimation schemes\nhave been proposed for FDD single-cell massive MIMO systems, but they fail to\nconsider inter-cell-interference (ICI) and suffer from downlink pilot\ncontamination in multi-cell scenario. To solve this problem, this paper\nproposes a compressive sensing (CS)-based CSIT estimation scheme to combat ICI\nin FDD multi-cell massive MIMO systems. Specifically, angle-domain massive MIMO\nchannels exhibit the common sparsity over different subcarriers, and such\nsparsity is partially shared by adjacent users. By exploiting these sparsity\nproperties, we design the pilot signal and the associated channel estimation\nalgorithm under the framework of CS theory, where the channels associated with\nmultiple adjacent BSs can be reliably estimated with low training overhead for\ndownlink pilot decontamination. Simulation results verify the good downlink\npilot decontamination performance of the proposed solution compared to its\nconventional counterparts in multi-cell FDD massive MIMO.",

It ensures\nfully-automated verification of safety properties using the state of the art\ntechniques (automated theorem provers and solvers), and provides diagnostics in\nterms of the notations used by engineers. In the last two years SafeCap has\nbeen successfully used to verify 26 real-world mainline interlockings,\ndeveloped by different suppliers and design offices. SafeCap is currently used\nin an advisory capacity, supplementing manual checking and testing processes by\nproviding an additional level of verification and enabling earlier\nidentification of errors.

The study finds that the fragmented nature\nof technology use between NGO infomediaries and the competition between NGOs\nfor funding hinders NGO infomediaries' ability to support building lasting\nresilience within the MDW community. Recommendations from this study seek to\nalign NGO infomediary tool development more closely with the MDW community in\nHong Kong's existing communicative ecologies.

We circumvent these limitations by introducing a scalable and flexible\nGraph Attention Multilayer Perceptron (GAMLP). With the separation of the\nnon-linear transformation and feature propagation, GAMLP significantly improves\nthe scalability and efficiency by performing the propagation procedure in a\npre-compute manner. With three principled receptive field attention, each node\nin GAMLP is flexible and adaptive in leveraging the propagated features over\nthe different sizes of reception field. We conduct extensive evaluations on the\nthree large open graph benchmarks (e.g., ogbn-papers100M, ogbn-products and\nogbn-mag), demonstrating that GAMLP not only achieves the state-of-art\nperformance, but also additionally provide high scalability and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Background: Thyroid volumetry is crucial in diagnosis, treatment and\nmonitoring of thyroid diseases. However, conventional thyroid volumetry with 2D\nultrasound is highly operator-dependent. This study compares 2D ultrasound and\ntracked 3D ultrasound with an automatic thyroid segmentation based on a deep\nneural network regarding inter- and intraobserver variability, time and\naccuracy. Volume reference was MRI. Methods: 28 healthy volunteers were scanned\nwith 2D and 3D ultrasound as well as by MRI. Three physicians (MD 1, 2, 3) with\ndifferent levels of experience (6, 4 and 1 a) performed three 2D ultrasound and\nthree tracked 3D ultrasound scans on each volunteer. In the 2D scans the\nthyroid lobe volumes were calculated with the ellipsoid formula. A\nconvolutional deep neural network (CNN) segmented the 3D thyroid lobes\nautomatically. On MRI (T1 VIBE sequence) the thyroid was manually segmented by\nan experienced medical doctor. Results: The CNN was trained to obtain a dice\nscore of 0.94. The interobserver variability comparing two MDs showed mean\ndifferences for 2D and 3D respectively of 0.58 ml to 0.52 ml (MD1 vs. 2), -1.33\nml to -0.17 ml (MD1 vs. 3) and -1.89 ml to -0.70 ml (MD2 vs. 3). Paired samples\nt-tests showed significant differences in two comparisons for 2D and none for\n3D. Intraobsever variability was similar for 2D and 3D ultrasound. Comparison\nof ultrasound volumes and MRI volumes by paired samples t-tests showed a\nsignificant difference for the 2D volumetry of all MDs, and no significant\ndifference for 3D ultrasound. Acquisition time was significantly shorter for 3D\nultrasound. Conclusion: Tracked 3D ultrasound combined with a CNN segmentation\nsignificantly reduces interobserver variability in thyroid volumetry and\nincreases the accuracy of the measurements with shorter acquisition times.",

    "abstract": "Citing legal opinions is a key part of legal argumentation, an expert task\nthat requires retrieval, extraction and summarization of information from court\ndecisions. The identification of legally salient parts in an opinion for the\npurpose of citation may be seen as a domain-specific formulation of a highlight\nextraction or passage retrieval task. As similar tasks in other domains such as\nweb search show significant attention and improvement, progress in the legal\ndomain is hindered by the lack of resources for training and evaluation.\nThis paper presents a new dataset that consists of the citation graph of\ncourt opinions, which cite previously published court opinions in support of\ntheir arguments. In particular, we focus on the verbatim quotes, i.e., where\nthe text of the original opinion is directly reused.\nWith this approach, we explain the relative importance of different text\nspans of a court opinion by showcasing their usage in citations, and measuring\ntheir contribution to the relations between opinions in the citation graph.\nWe release VerbCL, a large-scale dataset derived from CourtListener and\nintroduce the task of highlight extraction as a single-document summarization\ntask based on the citation graph establishing the first baseline results for\nthis task on the VerbCL dataset.",

However, finding such an accurate approximation is\nchallenging in the streaming setting, due to the limited computational\nresources. To alleviate this issue, this paper extends a popular matrix\nsketching technique, namely Frequent Directions, for constructing an efficient\nand accurate low-tubal-rank tensor approximation from streaming data based on\nthe tensor Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD). Specifically, the new\nalgorithm allows the tensor data to be observed slice by slice, but only needs\nto maintain and incrementally update a much smaller sketch which could capture\nthe principal information of the original tensor. The rigorous theoretical\nanalysis shows that the approximation error of the new algorithm can be\narbitrarily small when the sketch size grows linearly. Extensive experimental\nresults on both synthetic and real multi-dimensional data further reveal the\nsuperiority of the proposed algorithm compared with other sketching algorithms\nfor getting low-tubal-rank approximation, in terms of both efficiency and\naccuracy.",

    "abstract": "Automating physical database design has remained a long-term interest in\ndatabase research due to substantial performance gains afforded by optimised\nstructures. Despite significant progress, a majority of today's commercial\nsolutions are highly manual, requiring offline invocation by database\nadministrators (DBAs) who are expected to identify and supply representative\ntraining workloads. Even the latest advancements like query stores provide only\nlimited support for dynamic environments. This status quo is untenable:\nidentifying representative static workloads is no longer realistic; and\nphysical design tools remain susceptible to the query optimiser's cost\nmisestimates. Furthermore, modern application environments such as hybrid\ntransactional and analytical processing (HTAP) systems render analytical\nmodelling next to impossible.\nWe propose a self-driving approach to online index selection that eschews the\nDBA and query optimiser, and instead learns the benefits of viable structures\nthrough strategic exploration and direct performance observation. We view the\nproblem as one of sequential decision making under uncertainty, specifically\nwithin the bandit learning setting. Multi-armed bandits balance exploration and\nexploitation to provably guarantee average performance that converges to\npolicies that are optimal with perfect hindsight. Our comprehensive empirical\nevaluation against a state-of-the-art commercial tuning tool demonstrates up to\n75% speed-up on shifting and ad-hoc workloads and up to 28% speed-up on static\nworkloads in analytical processing environments. In HTAP environments, our\nsolution provides up to 59% speed-up on shifting and 51% speed-up on static\nworkloads. Furthermore, our bandit framework outperforms deep reinforcement\nlearning (RL) in terms of convergence speed and performance volatility\n(providing up to 58% speed-up).",

Use of ML to\nunderstand underlying patterns in gene mutations (genomics) has far-reaching\nresults, not only in overcoming diagnostic pitfalls, but also in designing\ntreatments for life-threatening diseases like cancer. Success and\nsustainability of ML algorithms depends on the quality and diversity of data\ncollected and used for training. Under-representation of groups (ethnic groups,\ngender groups, etc.) in such a dataset can lead to inaccurate predictions for\ncertain groups, which can further exacerbate systemic discrimination issues.\nIn this work, we propose TRAPDOOR, a methodology for identification of biased\ndatasets by repurposing a technique that has been mostly proposed for nefarious\npurposes: Neural network backdoors. We consider a typical collaborative\nlearning setting of the genomics supply chain, where data may come from\nhospitals, collaborative projects, or research institutes to a central cloud\nwithout awareness of bias against a sensitive group. In this context, we\ndevelop a methodology to leak potential bias information of the collective data\nwithout hampering the genuine performance using ML backdooring catered for\ngenomic applications. Using a real-world cancer dataset, we analyze the dataset\nwith the bias that already existed towards white individuals and also\nintroduced biases in datasets artificially, and our experimental result show\nthat TRAPDOOR can detect the presence of dataset bias with 100% accuracy, and\nfurthermore can also extract the extent of bias by recovering the percentage\nwith a small error.",

    "abstract": "The Sparsest Permutation (SP) algorithm is accurate but limited to about 9\nvariables in practice; the Greedy Sparest Permutation (GSP) algorithm is faster\nbut less weak theoretically. A compromise can be given, the Best Order Score\nSearch, which gives results as accurate as SP but for much larger and denser\ngraphs. BOSS (Best Order Score Search) is more accurate for two reason: (a) It\nassumes the \"brute faithfuness\" assumption, which is weaker than faithfulness,\nand (b) it uses a different traversal of permutations than the depth first\ntraversal used by GSP, obtained by taking each variable in turn and moving it\nto the position in the permutation that optimizes the model score. Results are\ngiven comparing BOSS to several related papers in the literature in terms of\nperformance, for linear, Gaussian data. In all cases, with the proper parameter\nsettings, accuracy of BOSS is lifted considerably with respect to competing\napproaches. In configurations tested, models with 60 variables are feasible\nwith large samples out to about an average degree of 12 in reasonable time,\nwith near-perfect accuracy, and sparse models with an average degree of 4 are\nfeasible out to about 300 variables on a laptop, again with near-perfect\naccuracy. Mixed continuous discrete and all-discrete datasets were also tested.\nThe mixed data analysis showed advantage for BOSS over GES more apparent at\nhigher depths with the same score; the discrete data analysis showed a very\nsmall advantage for BOSS over GES with the same score, perhaps not enough to\nprefer it.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning requires a large volume of sample data, especially when it\nis used in high-accuracy medical applications. However, patient records are one\nof the most sensitive private information that is not usually shared among\ninstitutes. This paper presents spatio-temporal split learning, a distributed\ndeep neural network framework, which is a turning point in allowing\ncollaboration among privacy-sensitive organizations. Our spatio-temporal split\nlearning presents how distributed machine learning can be efficiently conducted\nwith minimal privacy concerns. The proposed split learning consists of a number\nof clients and a centralized server. Each client has only has one hidden layer,\nwhich acts as the privacy-preserving layer, and the centralized server\ncomprises the other hidden layers and the output layer. Since the centralized\nserver does not need to access the training data and trains the deep neural\nnetwork with parameters received from the privacy-preserving layer, privacy of\noriginal data is guaranteed. We have coined the term, spatio-temporal split\nlearning, as multiple clients are spatially distributed to cover diverse\ndatasets from different participants, and we can temporally split the learning\nprocess, detaching the privacy preserving layer from the rest of the learning\nprocess to minimize privacy breaches. This paper shows how we can analyze the\nmedical data whilst ensuring privacy using our proposed multi-site\nspatio-temporal split learning algorithm on Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19)\nchest Computed Tomography (CT) scans, MUsculoskeletal RAdiographs (MURA) X-ray\nimages, and cholesterol levels.",

One such paradigm is automatic code generation. An AI could be\ngenerating anything; hence the output space is unconstrained. A self-driving\ncar is driven for 100 million miles to validate its safety, but tests cannot be\nwritten to monitor and cover an unconstrained space. One of the solutions to\nvalidate AI-generated content is to constrain the problem and convert it from\nabstract to realistic, and this can be accomplished by either validating the\nunconstrained algorithm using theoretical proofs or by using Monte-Carlo\nsimulation methods. In this case, we use the latter approach to test/validate a\nstatistically significant number of samples.

This is an extremely\nchallenging task as programs can have different logic with different naming\nconventions, but the metrics must capture the structure and logic of the\nprogram. This is similar to the importance grammar carries in AI-based text\ngeneration, Q&A, translations, etc. The various metrics that are garnered in\nthis work to support the evaluation of generated code are as follows:\nCompilation, NL description to logic conversion, number of edits needed, some\nof the commonly used static-code metrics and NLP metrics.

For instance, the minimum cut, the minimum $s$-$t$\ncut, the minimum multiway cut, and the minimum $k$-way cut are some of the\ncommonly encountered cut problems. Many of these problems have been extensively\nstudied over several decades. In this paper, we initiate the algorithmic study\nof some cut problems in high dimensions.\nThe first problem we study, namely, Topological Hitting Set (THS), is defined\nas follows: Given a nontrivial $r$-cycle $\\zeta$ in a simplicial complex\n$\\mathsf{K}$, find a set $\\mathcal{S}$ of $r$-dimensional simplices of minimum\ncardinality so that $\\mathcal{S}$ meets every cycle homologous to $\\zeta$. Our\nmain result is that this problem admits a polynomial-time solution on\ntriangulations of closed surfaces. Interestingly, the optimal solution is given\nin terms of the cocycles of the surface. For general complexes, we show that\nTHS is W[1]-hard with respect to the solution size $k$. On the positive side,\nwe show that THS admits an FPT algorithm with respect to $k+d$, where $d$ is\nthe maximum degree of the Hasse graph of the complex $\\mathsf{K}$.\nWe also define a problem called Boundary Nontrivialization (BNT): Given a\nbounding $r$-cycle $\\zeta$ in a simplicial complex $\\mathsf{K}$, find a set\n$\\mathcal{S}$ of $(r+1)$-dimensional simplices of minimum cardinality so that\nthe removal of $\\mathcal{S}$ from $\\mathsf{K}$ makes $\\zeta$ non-bounding.

In this short paper, we\nintroduce a novel approach called the \"Kinesthetic HMD\": actuating a\nhead-mounted display with force feedback in order to provide sensations of\nself-motion. We discuss its design considerations and demonstrate an augmented\nflight simulator use case with a proof-of-concept prototype. We conducted a\nuser study assessing our approach's ability to enhance self-motion sensations.\nTaken together, our results show that our Kinesthetic HMD provides\nsignificantly stronger and more egocentric sensations than a visual-only\nself-motion experience. Thus, by providing congruent vestibular and\nproprioceptive cues related to balance and self-motion, the Kinesthetic HMD\nrepresents a promising approach for a variety of virtual reality applications\nin which motion sensations are prominent.",

However, it is challenging to scale BERT for low-latency and\nhigh-throughput industrial use cases due to its enormous size. We successfully\noptimize a Query-Title Relevance (QTR) classifier for deployment via a compact\nmodel, which we name BERT Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BertBiLSTM).\nThe model is capable of inferring an input in at most 0.2ms on CPU. BertBiLSTM\nexceeds the off-the-shelf BERT model's performance in terms of accuracy and\nefficiency for the aforementioned real-world production task. We achieve this\nresult in two phases. First, we create a pre-trained model, called eBERT, which\nis the original BERT architecture trained with our unique item title corpus. We\nthen fine-tune eBERT for the QTR task. Second, we train the BertBiLSTM model to\nmimic the eBERT model's performance through a process called Knowledge\nDistillation (KD) and show the effect of data augmentation to achieve the\nresembling goal.

    "abstract": "Although current deep generative adversarial networks (GANs) could synthesize\nhigh-quality (HQ) images, discovering novel GAN encoders for image\nreconstruction is still favorable. When embedding images to latent space,\nexisting GAN encoders work well for aligned images (such as the human face),\nbut they do not adapt to more generalized GANs. To our knowledge, current\nstate-of-the-art GAN encoders do not have a proper encoder to reconstruct\nhigh-fidelity images from most misaligned HQ synthesized images on different\nGANs. Their performances are limited, especially on non-aligned and real\nimages. We propose a novel method (named MTV-TSA) to handle such problems.\nCreating multi-type latent vectors (MTV) from latent space and two-scale\nattentions (TSA) from images allows designing a set of encoders that can be\nadaptable to a variety of pre-trained GANs. We generalize two sets of loss\nfunctions to optimize the encoders. The designed encoders could make GANs\nreconstruct higher fidelity images from most synthesized HQ images. In\naddition, the proposed method can reconstruct real images well and process them\nbased on learned attribute directions. The designed encoders have unified\nconvolutional blocks and could match well in current GAN architectures (such as\nPGGAN, StyleGANs, and BigGAN) by fine-tuning the corresponding normalization\nlayers and the last block.

Verbal\ncommunication is, thus, key to convey relevant information to health\nprofessionals that would otherwise not be accessible to external entities.\nSpecifically, what a patient suffering of chronic pain describes from the\nexperience and how this information is disclosed reveals intrinsic qualities\nabout the patient and the experience of pain itself. We present the Reddit\nReports of Chronic Pain (RRCP) dataset, which comprises social media textual\ndescriptions and discussion of various forms of chronic pain experiences, as\nreported from the perspective of different base pathologies. For each\npathology, we identify the main concerns emergent of its consequent experience\nof chronic pain, as represented by the subset of documents explicitly related\nto it.

    "abstract": "Recent systems applying Machine Learning (ML) to solve the Traveling Salesman\nProblem (TSP) exhibit issues when they try to scale up to real case scenarios\nwith several hundred vertices. The use of Candidate Lists (CLs) has been\nbrought up to cope with the issues. The procedure allows to restrict the search\nspace during solution creation, consequently reducing the solver computational\nburden. So far, ML were engaged to create CLs and values on the edges of these\nCLs expressing ML preferences at solution insertion. Although promising, these\nsystems do not clearly restrict what the ML learns and does to create\nsolutions, bringing with them some generalization issues. Therefore, motivated\nby exploratory and statistical studies, in this work we instead use a machine\nlearning model to confirm the addition in the solution just for high probable\nedges. CLs of the high probable edge are employed as input, and the ML is in\ncharge of distinguishing cases where such edges are in the optimal solution\nfrom those where they are not. . This strategy enables a better generalization\nand creates an efficient balance between machine learning and searching\ntechniques. Our ML-Constructive heuristic is trained on small instances. Then,\nit is able to produce solutions, without losing quality, to large problems as\nwell. We compare our results with classic constructive heuristics, showing good\nperformances for TSPLIB instances up to 1748 cities. Although our heuristic\nexhibits an expensive constant time operation, we proved that the computational\ncomplexity in worst-case scenario, for the solution construction after\ntraining, is $O(n^2 \\log n^2)$, being $n$ the number of vertices in the TSP\ninstance.",

The task of tensor completion is crucial in many applications such\nas personalized recommendation, image and video restoration, and link\nprediction in social networks. Many tensor factorization and neural\nnetwork-based tensor completion algorithms have been developed to predict\nmissing entries in partially observed tensors. However, they can produce\ninaccurate estimations as real-world tensors are very sparse, and these methods\ntend to overfit on the small amount of data.

In this\npaper, we propose DAIN, a general data augmentation framework that enhances the\nprediction accuracy of neural tensor completion methods. Specifically, DAIN\nfirst trains a neural model and finds tensor cell importances with influence\nfunctions. After that, DAIN aggregates the cell importance to calculate the\nimportance of each entity (i.e., an index of a dimension). Finally, DAIN\naugments the tensor by weighted sampling of entity importances and a value\npredictor. Extensive experimental results show that DAIN outperforms all data\naugmentation baselines in terms of enhancing imputation accuracy of neural\ntensor completion on four diverse real-world tensors.

First efforts in FL focused\non learning a single global model with good average performance across clients,\nbut the global model may be arbitrarily bad for a given client, due to the\ninherent heterogeneity of local data distributions. Federated multi-task\nlearning (MTL) approaches can learn personalized models by formulating an\nopportune penalized optimization problem.

ASR using a limited vocabulary is a subset of\nthe speech recognition problem that focuses on the recognition of a small\nnumber of words or sentences. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive view\nof mechanisms behind ASR systems as well as techniques, tools, projects, recent\ncontributions, and possibly future directions in ASR using a limited\nvocabulary. This work consequently provides a way to go when designing ASR\nsystem using limited vocabulary. Although an emphasis is put on limited\nvocabulary, most of the tools and techniques reported in this survey applied to\nASR systems in general.",

    "abstract": "Proof assistants play a dual role as programming languages and logical\nsystems. As programming languages, proof assistants offer standard modularity\nmechanisms such as first-class functions, type polymorphism and modules. As\nlogical systems, however, modularity is lacking, and understandably so:\nincompatible reasoning principles -- such as univalence and uniqueness of\nidentity proofs -- can indirectly lead to logical inconsistency when used in a\ngiven development, even when they appear to be confined to different modules.\nThe lack of logical modularity in proof assistants also hinders the adoption of\nricher programming constructs, such as effects. We propose the multiverse, a\ngeneral type-theoretic approach to endow proof assistants with logical\nmodularity. The multiverse consists of multiple universe hierarchies that\nstatically describe the reasoning principles and effects available to define a\nterm at a given type. We identify sufficient conditions for this structuring to\nmodularly ensure that incompatible principles do not interfere, and to locally\nrestrict the power of dependent elimination when necessary. This extensible\napproach generalizes the ad-hoc treatment of the sort of propositions in the\nCoq proof assistant. We illustrate the power of the multiverse by describing\nthe inclusion of Coq-style propositions, the strict propositions of Gilbert et\nal., the exceptional type theory of P\\'edrot and Tabareau, and general\naxiomatic extensions of the logic.",

For\ninstance, groups targeted by biased algorithms will feel unfairly treated and\neven fearful of negative consequences of these biases. This work targets biased\ngenerative models' behaviors, identifying the cause of the biases and\neliminating them. We can (as expected) conclude that biased data causes biased\npredictions of face frontalization models. Varying the proportions of male and\nfemale faces in the training data can have a substantial effect on behavior on\nthe test data: we found that the seemingly obvious choice of 50:50 proportions\nwas not the best for this dataset to reduce biased behavior on female faces,\nwhich was 71% unbiased as compared to our top unbiased rate of 84%. Failure in\ngeneration and generating incorrect gender faces are two behaviors of these\nmodels. In addition, only some layers in face frontalization models are\nvulnerable to biased datasets. Optimizing the skip-connections of the generator\nin face frontalization models can make models less biased. We conclude that it\nis likely to be impossible to eliminate all training bias without an unlimited\nsize dataset, and our experiments show that the bias can be reduced and\nquantified.

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have shown a potential for having low energy\nwith unsupervised learning capabilities due to their biologically-inspired\ncomputation. However, they may suffer from accuracy degradation if their\nprocessing is performed under the presence of hardware-induced faults in\nmemories, which can come from manufacturing defects or voltage-induced\napproximation errors. Since recent works still focus on the fault-modeling and\nrandom fault injection in SNNs, the impact of memory faults in SNN hardware\narchitectures on accuracy and the respective fault-mitigation techniques are\nnot thoroughly explored. Toward this, we propose ReSpawn, a novel framework for\nmitigating the negative impacts of faults in both the off-chip and on-chip\nmemories for resilient and energy-efficient SNNs. The key mechanisms of ReSpawn\nare: (1) analyzing the fault tolerance of SNNs; and (2) improving the SNN fault\ntolerance through (a) fault-aware mapping (FAM) in memories, and (b)\nfault-aware training-and-mapping (FATM). If the training dataset is not fully\navailable, FAM is employed through efficient bit-shuffling techniques that\nplace the significant bits on the non-faulty memory cells and the insignificant\nbits on the faulty ones, while minimizing the memory access energy. Meanwhile,\nif the training dataset is fully available, FATM is employed by considering the\nfaulty memory cells in the data mapping and training processes. The\nexperimental results show that, compared to the baseline SNN without\nfault-mitigation techniques, ReSpawn with a fault-aware mapping scheme improves\nthe accuracy by up to 70% for a network with 900 neurons without retraining.",

Data-efficient RL has gone through three\nmajor stages: pure on-line RL where every data-point is considered only once,\nRL with a replay buffer where additional learning is done on a portion of the\nexperience, and finally transition memory based RL, where, conceptually, all\ntransitions are stored and re-used in every update step. While inferring\nknowledge from all explicitly stored experience has lead to a tremendous gain\nin data-efficiency, the question of how this data is collected has been vastly\nunderstudied. We argue that data-efficiency can only be achieved through\ncareful consideration of both aspects. We propose to make this insight explicit\nvia a paradigm that we call 'Collect and Infer', which explicitly models RL as\ntwo separate but interconnected processes, concerned with data collection and\nknowledge inference respectively.

    "abstract": "The past decade has seen a substantial rise in the amount of mis- and\ndisinformation online, from targeted disinformation campaigns to influence\npolitics, to the unintentional spreading of misinformation about public health.\nThis development has spurred research in the area of automatic fact checking,\nfrom approaches to detect check-worthy claims and determining the stance of\ntweets towards claims, to methods to determine the veracity of claims given\nevidence documents. These automatic methods are often content-based, using\nnatural language processing methods, which in turn utilise deep neural networks\nto learn higher-order features from text in order to make predictions. As deep\nneural networks are black-box models, their inner workings cannot be easily\nexplained. At the same time, it is desirable to explain how they arrive at\ncertain decisions, especially if they are to be used for decision making. While\nthis has been known for some time, the issues this raises have been exacerbated\nby models increasing in size, and by EU legislation requiring models to be used\nfor decision making to provide explanations, and, very recently, by legislation\nrequiring online platforms operating in the EU to provide transparent reporting\non their services. Despite this, current solutions for explainability are still\nlacking in the area of fact checking. This thesis presents my research on\nautomatic fact checking, including claim check-worthiness detection, stance\ndetection and veracity prediction. Its contributions go beyond fact checking,\nwith the thesis proposing more general machine learning solutions for natural\nlanguage processing in the area of learning with limited labelled data.\nFinally, the thesis presents some first solutions for explainable fact\nchecking.",

This\ncharacteristic has an unignorable effect on performance. Recent\ncross-resolution face recognition approaches used simple, arbitrary, and\nunrealistic down- and up-scaling techniques to measure robustness against\nreal-world edge-cases in image quality. Thus, we propose a new standardized\nbenchmark dataset derived from the famous Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW). In\ncontrast to previous derivatives, which focus on pose, age, similarity, and\nadversarial attacks, our Cross-Quality Labeled Faces in the Wild (XQLFW)\ndataset maximizes the quality difference. It contains only more realistic\nsynthetically degraded images when necessary. Our proposed dataset is then used\nto further investigate the influence of image quality on several\nstate-of-the-art approaches. With XQLFW, we show that these models perform\ndifferently in cross-quality cases, and hence, the generalizing capability is\nnot accurately predicted by their performance on LFW. Additionally, we report\nbaseline accuracy with recent deep learning models explicitly trained for\ncross-resolution applications and evaluate the susceptibility to image quality.\nTo encourage further research in cross-resolution face recognition and incite\nthe assessment of image quality robustness, we publish the database and code\nfor evaluation.",

Second, we show how the exceptional musical\nicosahedra are applied to analyzing harmonies constructed by four or more\ntones. We introduce two concepts, golden decomposition and golden singular. The\ngolden decomposition is a decomposition of a given harmony into some harmonies\nconstructing the given harmony and represented the golden figure (a golden\ntriangle, a golden gnomon, or a golden rectangle).

While the dominant seventh chord is\ngolden singular in the type 1[star] and the type 4[star] exceptional musical\nicosahedron, the half-diminished seventh chord is golden singular in the type 2\n[star] and the type 3[star] exceptional musical icosahedron. Last, we apply the\ngolden analysis to the famous prelude in C major by Johan Sebastian Bach (BWV\n846).

However, using generative modeling\nto design substances with desired properties is difficult because candidate\ncompounds must satisfy multiple constraints, including synthetic accessibility\nand other metrics that are intuitive to domain experts but challenging to\nquantify. We propose C5T5, a novel self-supervised pretraining method that\nenables transformers to make zero-shot select-and-replace edits, altering\norganic substances towards desired property values. C5T5 operates on IUPAC\nnames -- a standardized molecular representation that intuitively encodes rich\nstructural information for organic chemists but that has been largely ignored\nby the ML community. Our technique requires no edited molecule pairs to train\nand only a rough estimate of molecular properties, and it has the potential to\nmodel long-range dependencies and symmetric molecular structures more easily\nthan graph-based methods. C5T5 also provides a powerful interface to domain\nexperts: it grants users fine-grained control over the generative process by\nselecting and replacing IUPAC name fragments, which enables experts to leverage\ntheir intuitions about structure-activity relationships.

    "abstract": "Consider a scenario where we are supplied with a number of ready-to-use\nmodels trained on a certain source domain and hope to directly apply the most\nappropriate ones to different target domains based on the models' relative\nperformance. Ideally we should annotate a validation set for model performance\nassessment on each new target environment, but such annotations are often very\nexpensive. Under this circumstance, we introduce the problem of ranking models\nin unlabeled new environments. For this problem, we propose to adopt a proxy\ndataset that 1) is fully labeled and 2) well reflects the true model rankings\nin a given target environment, and use the performance rankings on the proxy\nsets as surrogates. We first select labeled datasets as the proxy.\nSpecifically, datasets that are more similar to the unlabeled target domain are\nfound to better preserve the relative performance rankings. Motivated by this,\nwe further propose to search the proxy set by sampling images from various\ndatasets that have similar distributions as the target. We analyze the problem\nand its solutions on the person re-identification (re-ID) task, for which\nsufficient datasets are publicly available, and show that a carefully\nconstructed proxy set effectively captures relative performance ranking in new\nenvironments.

    "abstract": "Recent work on data-driven control and reinforcement learning has renewed\ninterest in a relative old field in control theory: model-free optimal control\napproaches which work directly with a cost function and do not rely upon\nperfect knowledge of a system model. Instead, an \"oracle\" returns an estimate\nof the cost associated to, for example, a proposed linear feedback law to solve\na linear-quadratic regulator problem. This estimate, and an estimate of the\ngradient of the cost, might be obtained by performing experiments on the\nphysical system being controlled. This motivates in turn the analysis of\nsteepest descent algorithms and their associated gradient differential\nequations. This note studies the effect of errors in the estimation of the\ngradient, framed in the language of input to state stability, where the input\nrepresents a perturbation from the true gradient. Since one needs to study\nsystems evolving on proper open subsets of Euclidean space, a self-contained\nreview of input to state stability definitions and theorems for systems that\nevolve on such sets is included. The results are then applied to the study of\nnoisy gradient systems, as well as the associated steepest descent algorithms.",

Efficiently executing\nlossless compression has become a practical problem. Commonly, it is hard to\nmake accurate probability estimates for each pixel. To tackle this, we propose\nL3C-Stereo, a multi-scale lossless compression model consisting of two main\nmodules: the warping module and the probability estimation module. The warping\nmodule takes advantage of two view feature maps from the same domain to\ngenerate a disparity map, which is used to reconstruct the right view so as to\nimprove the confidence of the probability estimate of the right view. The\nprobability estimation module provides pixel-wise logistic mixture\ndistributions for adaptive arithmetic coding.

Proton therapy\nnecessitates a high level of delivery accuracy to exploit the selective\ntargeting imparted by the Bragg peak. For this purpose, pCT utilizes the proton\nbeam itself to create images. The technique works by sending a low-intensity\nbeam of protons through the patient and measuring the position, direction, and\nenergy loss of each exiting proton. The pCT technique allows reconstruction of\nthe volumetric distribution of the relative stopping power (RSP) of the patient\ntissues for use in treatment planning and pre-treatment range verification. We\nhave investigated new ways to make the reconstruction both efficient and\naccurate. Better accuracy of RSP also enables more robust inverse approaches to\nIMPT. For IMPT, we developed a framework for performing intensity-modulation of\nthe proton pencil beams. We expect that these developments will lead to\nadditional project work in the years to come, which requires a regular exchange\nbetween experts in the fields of mathematics, computer science, and medical\nphysics. We have initiated such an exchange by organizing annual workshops on\npCT and IMPT algorithm and technology developments.

    "abstract": "Recent works report that increasing the learning rate or decreasing the\nminibatch size in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can improve test set\nperformance. We argue this is expected under some conditions in models with a\nloss function with multiple local minima. Our main contribution is an\napproximate but analytical approach inspired by methods in Physics to study the\nrole of the SGD learning rate and batch size in generalization. We characterize\ntest set performance under a shift between the training and test data\ndistributions for loss functions with multiple minima. The shift can simply be\ndue to sampling, and is therefore typically present in practical applications.\nWe show that the resulting shift in local minima worsens test performance by\npicking up curvature, implying that generalization improves by selecting wide\nand/or little-shifted local minima. We then specialize to SGD, and study its\ntest performance under stationarity. Because obtaining the exact stationary\ndistribution of SGD is intractable, we derive a Fokker-Planck approximation of\nSGD and obtain its stationary distribution instead. This process shows that the\nlearning rate divided by the minibatch size plays a role analogous to\ntemperature in statistical mechanics, and implies that SGD, including its\nstationary distribution, is largely invariant to changes in learning rate or\nbatch size that leave its temperature constant. We show that increasing SGD\ntemperature encourages the selection of local minima with lower curvature, and\ncan enable better generalization. We provide experiments on CIFAR10\ndemonstrating the temperature invariance of SGD, improvement of the test loss\nas SGD temperature increases, and quantifying the impact of sampling versus\ndomain shift in driving this effect.

In this\nstudy, a forecasting solution is proposed, to predict daily new cases of\nCOVID-19 in regions small enough where containment measures could be locally\nimplemented, by targeting three main shortcomings that exist in literature; the\nunreliability of existing data caused by inconsistent testing patterns in\nsmaller regions, weak deploy-ability of forecasting models towards predicting\ncases in previously unseen regions, and model training biases caused by the\nimbalanced nature of data in COVID-19 epi-curves. Hence, the contributions of\nthis study are three-fold; an optimized smoothing technique to smoothen less\ndeterministic epi-curves based on epidemiological dynamics of that region, a\nLong-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) based forecasting model trained using data from\nselect regions to create a representative and diverse training set that\nmaximizes deploy-ability in regions with lack of historical data, and an\nadaptive loss function whilst training to mitigate the data imbalances seen in\nepi-curves. The proposed smoothing technique, the generalized training strategy\nand the adaptive loss function largely increased the overall accuracy of the\nforecast, which enables efficient containment measures at a more localized\nmicro-level.",

The\nclustering framework uses a combination of density and hierarchical techniques\nto determine the size and homogeneity of the clusters. The second framework\nconsists of a self-supervised deep learning framework to label regions of\ngeological interest in seismic images. It projects the latent-space of an\nencoder-decoder architecture unto two orthogonal subspaces, from which it\nlearns to delineate regions of interest in the seismic images. To demonstrate\nan application of both frameworks, a seismic volume was clustered into various\ncontiguous clusters, from which four clusters were selected based on distinct\nseismic patterns: horizons, faults, salt domes and chaotic structures.

Despite their\npracticality, m-OT suffers from misspecified mappings, namely, mappings that\nare optimal on the mini-batch level but do not exist in the optimal\ntransportation plan between the original measures. To address the misspecified\nmappings issue, we propose a novel mini-batch method by using partial optimal\ntransport (POT) between mini-batch empirical measures, which we refer to as\nmini-batch partial optimal transport (m-POT). Leveraging the insight from the\npartial transportation, we explain the source of misspecified mappings from the\nm-OT and motivate why limiting the amount of transported masses among\nmini-batches via POT can alleviate the incorrect mappings. Finally, we carry\nout extensive experiments on various applications to compare m-POT with m-OT\nand recently proposed mini-batch method, mini-batch unbalanced optimal\ntransport (m-UOT). We observe that m-POT is better than m-OT deep domain\nadaptation applications while having comparable performance with m-UOT.

In addition to this data-free design approach, we also consider\na deep learning-based design method to optimize the transmission coefficients\nof diffractive surfaces by using examples of input/output fields corresponding\nto the target transformation.

It becomes more challenging to reconstruct the image from a\ncollection of random projection lines. We propose an adversarial learning based\napproach to recover the image and the projection angle distribution by matching\nthe empirical distribution of the measurements with the generated data. Fitting\nthe distributions is achieved through solving a min-max game between a\ngenerator and a critic based on Wasserstein generative adversarial network\nstructure.

    "abstract": "Protein-ligand complex structures have been utilised to design benchmark\nmachine learning methods that perform important tasks related to drug design\nsuch as receptor binding site detection, small molecule docking and binding\naffinity prediction. However, these methods are usually trained on only ligand\nbound (or holo) conformations of the protein and therefore are not guaranteed\nto perform well when the protein structure is in its native unbound\nconformation (or apo), which is usually the conformation available for a newly\nidentified receptor. A primary reason for this is that the local structure of\nthe binding site usually changes upon ligand binding. To facilitate solutions\nfor this problem, we propose a dataset called APObind that aims to provide apo\nconformations of proteins present in the PDBbind dataset, a popular dataset\nused in drug design. Furthermore, we explore the performance of methods\nspecific to three use cases on this dataset, through which, the importance of\nvalidating them on the APObind dataset is demonstrated.",

    "title": "Efficient Medical Image Segmentation Based on Knowledge Distillation",
    "abstract": "Recent advances have been made in applying convolutional neural networks to\nachieve more precise prediction results for medical image segmentation\nproblems. However, the success of existing methods has highly relied on huge\ncomputational complexity and massive storage, which is impractical in the\nreal-world scenario. To deal with this problem, we propose an efficient\narchitecture by distilling knowledge from well-trained medical image\nsegmentation networks to train another lightweight network. This architecture\nempowers the lightweight network to get a significant improvement on\nsegmentation capability while retaining its runtime efficiency. We further\ndevise a novel distillation module tailored for medical image segmentation to\ntransfer semantic region information from teacher to student network. It forces\nthe student network to mimic the extent of difference of representations\ncalculated from different tissue regions. This module avoids the ambiguous\nboundary problem encountered when dealing with medical imaging but instead\nencodes the internal information of each semantic region for transferring.\nBenefited from our module, the lightweight network could receive an improvement\nof up to 32.6% in our experiment while maintaining its portability in the\ninference phase. The entire structure has been verified on two widely accepted\npublic CT datasets LiTS17 and KiTS19. We demonstrate that a lightweight network\ndistilled by our method has non-negligible value in the scenario which requires\nrelatively high operating speed and low storage usage.",

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents unique and unknown\nproblem complexities and modeling challenges, where an imperative task is to\nmodel both its process and data uncertainties, represented in implicit and\nhigh-proportional undocumented infections, asymptomatic contagion, social\nreinforcement of infections, and various quality issues in the reported data.\nThese uncertainties become even more phenomenal in the overwhelming\nmutation-dominated resurgences with vaccinated but still susceptible\npopulations. Here we introduce a novel hybrid approach to (1) characterizing\nand distinguishing Undocumented (U) and Documented (D) infections commonly seen\nduring COVID-19 incubation periods and asymptomatic infections by expanding the\nfoundational compartmental epidemic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model\nwith two compartments, resulting in a new Susceptible-Undocumented\ninfected-Documented infected-Recovered (SUDR) model; (2) characterizing the\nprobabilistic density of infections by empowering SUDR to capture exogenous\nprocesses like clustering contagion interactions, superspreading and social\nreinforcement; and (3) approximating the density likelihood of COVID-19\nprevalence over time by incorporating Bayesian inference into SUDR. Different\nfrom existing COVID-19 models, SUDR characterizes the undocumented infections\nduring unknown transmission processes. To capture the uncertainties of temporal\ntransmission and social reinforcement during the COVID-19 contagion, the\ntransmission rate is modeled by a time-varying density function of undocumented\ninfectious cases. We solve the modeling by sampling from the mean-field\nposterior distribution with reasonable priors, making SUDR suitable to handle\nthe randomness, noise and sparsity of COVID-19 observations widely seen in the\npublic COVID-19 case data.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, 1D models based on scaling laws have been used to\nparameterized convective heat transfer rocks in the interior of terrestrial\nplanets like Earth, Mars, Mercury and Venus to tackle the computational\nbottleneck of high-fidelity forward runs in 2D or 3D. However, these are\nlimited in the amount of physics they can model (e.g. depth dependent material\nproperties) and predict only mean quantities such as the mean mantle\ntemperature. We recently showed that feedforward neural networks (FNN) trained\nusing a large number of 2D simulations can overcome this limitation and\nreliably predict the evolution of entire 1D laterally-averaged temperature\nprofile in time for complex models [Agarwal et al. 2020]. We now extend that\napproach to predict the full 2D temperature field, which contains more\ninformation in the form of convection structures such as hot plumes and cold\ndownwellings. Using a dataset of 10,525 two-dimensional simulations of the\nthermal evolution of the mantle of a Mars-like planet, we show that deep\nlearning techniques can produce reliable parameterized surrogates (i.e.\nsurrogates that predict state variables such as temperature based only on\nparameters) of the underlying partial differential equations. We first use\nconvolutional autoencoders to compress the temperature fields by a factor of\n142 and then use FNN and long-short term memory networks (LSTM) to predict the\ncompressed fields. On average, the FNN predictions are 99.30% and the LSTM\npredictions are 99.22% accurate with respect to unseen simulations. Proper\northogonal decomposition (POD) of the LSTM and FNN predictions shows that\ndespite a lower mean absolute relative accuracy, LSTMs capture the flow\ndynamics better than FNNs. When summed, the POD coefficients from FNN\npredictions and from LSTM predictions amount to 96.51% and 97.66% relative to\nthe coefficients of the original simulations, respectively.",

Due to the reactionary nature of these iterations, little effort has\nbeen made to accumulate data in a manner that allows for deep exploration and\nunderstanding of the total design space.

In order to address the challenge that the\ntransferabilities of different sensors are different, we propose SALIENCE\n(unsupervised user adaptation model for multiple wearable sensors based human\nactivity recognition) model. It aligns the data of each sensor separately to\nachieve local alignment, while uniformly aligning the data of all sensors to\nensure global alignment. In addition, an attention mechanism is proposed to\nfocus the activity classifier of SALIENCE on the sensors with strong feature\ndiscrimination and well distribution alignment. Experiments are conducted on\ntwo public WHAR datasets, and the experimental results show that our model can\nyield a competitive performance.",

To realize accurate positioning, collaborative localization plays\nan important role. This type of localization computes range measurements\nbetween vehicles and improves the accuracy of position by correcting the\npossibly faulty values of one of them by using the more accurate values of the\nother. 5G signals with the technology of Millimeter Wave (mmWave) support\nprecise range measurements and 5G networks provide Device to Device (D2D)\ncommunication which improves collaborative localization.

Previous generation of SiP coherent\nimagers suffer from relative optical phase fluctuations between the signal and\nreference paths, which results in random phase and amplitude fluctuations in\nthe output signal. This limitation negatively impacts the SNR and signal\nacquisition times. Here we present a coherent imager system that suppresses the\noptical carrier signal and removes non-idealities from the relative optical\npath using a photonic in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) receiver via a $90^\\circ$\nhybrid detector. Furthermore, we incorporate row-column read-out and row-column\naddressing schemes to address the electro-optical interconnect density\nchallenge. Our novel row-column read-out architecture for the sensor array\nrequires only $2N$ interconnects for $N^2$ sensors. An $8\\times8$ IQ sensor\narray is presented as a proof-of-concept demonstration with $1.2\\times 10^{-5}$\nresolution over range accuracy.

While good theoretical convergence guarantee has\nnot been established for this method, experiments on small scale problems show\nthat the method works very competitively against other well known modifications\nof Newton's method such as Adaptive Cubic Regularization and BFGS, as well as\nfirst order methods such as Unbounded Two-way Backtracking Gradient Descent.\nIn this paper, we resolve the convergence guarantee issue by proposing a\nmodification of New Q-Newton's method, named New Q-Newton's method\nBacktracking, which incorporates a more sophisticated use of hyperparameters\nand a Backtracking line search. This new method has very good theoretical\nguarantees, which for a {\\bf Morse function} yields the following (which is\nunknown for New Q-Newton's method):\n{\\bf Theorem.} Let $f:\\mathbb{R}^m\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a Morse\nfunction, that is all its critical points have invertible Hessian.

We\nhave tested in experiments on small scale, with some further simplified\nversions of New Q-Newton's method Backtracking, and found that the new method\nsignificantly improve New Q-Newton's method.",

    "abstract": "Image restoration is a long-standing low-level vision problem that aims to\nrestore high-quality images from low-quality images (e.g., downscaled, noisy\nand compressed images). While state-of-the-art image restoration methods are\nbased on convolutional neural networks, few attempts have been made with\nTransformers which show impressive performance on high-level vision tasks. In\nthis paper, we propose a strong baseline model SwinIR for image restoration\nbased on the Swin Transformer. SwinIR consists of three parts: shallow feature\nextraction, deep feature extraction and high-quality image reconstruction. In\nparticular, the deep feature extraction module is composed of several residual\nSwin Transformer blocks (RSTB), each of which has several Swin Transformer\nlayers together with a residual connection. We conduct experiments on three\nrepresentative tasks: image super-resolution (including classical, lightweight\nand real-world image super-resolution), image denoising (including grayscale\nand color image denoising) and JPEG compression artifact reduction.\nExperimental results demonstrate that SwinIR outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods on different tasks by $\\textbf{up to 0.14$\\sim$0.45dB}$, while the\ntotal number of parameters can be reduced by $\\textbf{up to 67%}$.",
